The first book, called \"On the Witness Stand,\"\r\nstudied the relations of scientific psychology to crime and the law\r\ncourts. This new book deals with the relations of psychology to\r\nmedicine. Others discussing its relations to education, to social\r\nproblems, to commerce and industry will follow soon.\r\n\r\nFor popular treatment I divide applied psychology into such various,\r\nseparated books because they naturally address very different audiences.\r\nThat which interests the lawyer does not concern the physician, and\r\nagain the school-teacher has his own sphere of interests. Moreover the\r\ndifferent subjects demand a different treatment. The problems of\r\npsychology and law were almost entirely neglected. I was anxious to draw\r\nwide attention to this promising field and therefore I chose the form of\r\nloose popular essays without any aim towards systematic presentation of\r\nthe subject. As to psychology and medicine almost the opposite situation\r\nprevails. There is perhaps too much talk afloat about psychotherapy, the\r\nwidest circles cultivate the discussion, the magazines overflow with\r\nit. The duty of the scientific psychologist is accordingly not to stir\r\nup interest in this topic but to help in bringing this interest from\r\nmere gossip, vague mysticism, and medical amateurishness to a clear\r\nunderstanding of principles. What is needed in this time of faith cures\r\nof a hundred types is to deal with the whole circle of problems in a\r\nserious, systematic way and to emphasize the aspect of scientific\r\npsychological theory.\r\n\r\nHence the whole first part of this book is an abstract discussion and\r\nits first chapters have not even any direct relation to disease. I am\r\nconvinced that both physicians and ministers and all who are in\r\npractical contact with these important questions ought to be brought to\r\nsuch painstaking and perhaps fatiguing inquiry into principles before\r\nthe facts are reached. To those who seek a discussion of life facts\r\nalone, the whole first part will of course appear to be a tedious way\r\naround; they may turn directly to the second and third parts.\r\n\r\nOne word for my personal right to deal with these questions, as too much\r\nillegitimate psychotherapeutics is heard to-day. For me, the relation\r\nbetween psychology and medicine is not a chance chapter of my science to\r\nwhich I have turned simply in following up the various sides of applied\r\npsychology. And still less have I turned to it because it has become the\r\nfashion in recent years. On the contrary, it has been an important\r\nfactor in all my work since my student days. I have been through five\r\nyears of regular medical studies, three years in Leipzig and two years\r\nin Heidelberg; I have an M.D. degree from the University of Heidelberg.\r\nIn my first year as docent in a German university twenty years ago, I\r\ngave throughout the winter semester before several hundred students a\r\ncourse in hypnotism and its medical application. It was probably the\r\nfirst university course on hypnotism given anywhere. Since that time I\r\nhave never ceased to work psychotherapeutically in the psychological\r\nlaboratory. Yet that must not be misunderstood. I have no clinic, and\r\nwhile by principle I have never hypnotized anyone for mere experiment's\r\nsake but always only for medical purposes, yet I adjust my practical\r\nwork entirely to the interests of my scientific study. The limitations\r\nof my time force me to refuse the psychotherapeutic treatment of any\r\ncase which has not a certain scientific interest for me, and of the many\r\nhundreds whom I have helped in the laboratory, no one ever had to pay\r\nanything. Thus my practical work has strictly the character of\r\nlaboratory research.\r\n\r\nThe chief aim of this book is twofold. It is a negative one: I want to\r\ncounteract the misunderstandings which overflood the whole field,\r\nespecially by the careless mixing of mental and moral influence. And a\r\npositive one: I want to strengthen the public feeling that the time has\r\ncome when every physician should systematically study psychology, the\r\nnormal in the college years and the abnormal in the medical school. This\r\ndemand of medical education cannot be postponed any longer. The aim of\r\nthe book is not to fight the Emmanuel Church Movement, or even\r\nChristian Science or any other psychotherapeutic tendency outside of the\r\nfield of scientific medicine. I see the element of truth in all of them,\r\nbut they ought to be symptoms of transition. Scientific medicine should\r\ntake hold of psychotherapeutics now or a most deplorable disorganization\r\nwill set in, the symptoms of which no one ought to overlook to-day.\r\n\r\n                                                       HUGO MÜNSTERBERG.\r\n\r\n  HARVARD UNIVERSITY, March 20, 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER                                                             PAGE\r\n\r\n     I.

It stands at the side of physicotherapy, which attempts to\r\ncure the sick by influencing the body, perhaps with drugs and medicines,\r\nor with electricity or baths or diet.\r\n\r\nPsychotherapy is sharply to be separated from psychiatry, the treatment\r\nof mental diseases. Of course to a certain degree, mental illness too,\r\nis open to mental treatment; but certainly many diseases of the mind lie\r\nentirely beyond the reach of psychotherapy, and on the other hand\r\npsychotherapy may be applied also to diseases which are not mental at\r\nall. That which binds all psychotherapeutic efforts together into unity\r\nis the method of treatment. The psychotherapist must always somehow set\r\nlevers of the mind in motion and work through them towards the removal\r\nof the sufferer's ailment; but the disturbances to be treated may show\r\nthe greatest possible variety and may belong to mind or body.\r\n\r\nTreatment of diseases by influence on the mind is as old as human\r\nhistory, but it has attained at various times very different degrees of\r\nimportance. There is no lack of evidence that we have entered into a\r\nperiod in which an especial emphasis will be laid on the too long\r\nneglected psychical factor. This new movement is probably only in its\r\nbeginning and the loudness with which it presents itself to-day is one\r\nof the many indications of its immaturity. Whether it will be a blessing\r\nor a danger, whether it will really lead forward in a lasting way, or\r\nwhether it will soon demand a reaction, will probably depend in the\r\nfirst place on the soberness and thoroughness of the discussion. If the\r\nmovement is carried on under the control of science, it may yield\r\nlasting results. If it keeps the features of dilettanteism and prefers\r\nassociation with the antiscientific tendencies, it is pre-destined to\r\nhave a spasmodic character and ultimately to be harmful.\r\n\r\nThe chaotic character of psychotherapy in this first decade of the\r\ntwentieth century can be easily understood. It results from the fact\r\nthat in our period one great wave of civilization is sinking and a new\r\nwave rising, while the one has not entirely disappeared and the other is\r\nstill far from its height. The history of civilization has shown at all\r\ntimes a wavelike alternation between realism and idealism, that is,\r\nbetween an interest in that which is, and an interest in that which\r\nought to be. In the realistic periods, the study of facts, especially of\r\nthe facts of nature, is prevalent; in idealistic periods, history and\r\nliterature appeal to the world. In realistic periods, technique enjoys\r\nits triumphs; in idealistic periods, art and religion prevail. Such a\r\nrealistic movement lies behind us. It began with the incomparable\r\ndevelopment of physics, chemistry, and biology, in the middle of the\r\nlast century, and it brought with it the achievements of modern\r\nengineering and medicine. We are still fully under the influence of this\r\ngigantic movement and its real achievements will never leave us; and yet\r\nthis realistic wave is ebbing to-day and a new period of idealism is\r\nrising. If the signs are not deceitful, this new movement may reach its\r\nhistorical climax a few decades hence, when new leaders may give to the\r\nidealistic view of the world the same classical expression which Darwin\r\nand others gave to the receding naturalistic age. The signs are clear\r\nindeed that the days of idealistic philosophy and of art, and of\r\nreligion, are approaching; that the world is tired of merely connecting\r\nfacts without asking what their ultimate meaning is. The world dimly\r\nfeels again that technical civilization alone cannot make life more\r\nworth living. The aim of the last generation was to explain the world;\r\nthe aim of the next generation will be to interpret the world; the one\r\nwas seeking laws, the other will seek ideals.\r\n\r\nPsychotherapy stands in the service of both; it is the last word of the\r\npassing naturalistic movement, and yet in another way it tries to be the\r\nfirst word of the coming idealistic movement; and because it is under\r\nthe influence of both, it speaks sometimes the language of the one, and\r\nsometimes the language of the other. That brings about a confusion and a\r\ndisorder which must be detrimental. To transform this vagueness into\r\nclear, distinct relations is the immediate duty of science.\r\n\r\nIndeed it may be said that psychotherapy is the last word of a\r\nnaturalistic age, because psychotherapy finds its real stronghold in a\r\nsystematic study of the mental laws, and such study of mental laws,\r\npsychology, must indeed be the ultimate outcome of a naturalistic view\r\nof the world. Realism begins with the analysis of lifeless nature,\r\nbegins with the study of the stars and the stones, of masses and of\r\natoms. At a higher level, it turns then to the living organism, studies\r\nplants and animals and even brings the human organism entirely under the\r\npoint of view of natural law. When science has thus mastered the whole\r\nphysical universe, it finally brings even the mental life of man under\r\nthe naturalistic point of view, treats his inner experiences like any\r\nouter objects, tears them in pieces, analyzes them, and studies them as\r\nfunctions of the nervous system. A scientific psychology is thus reached\r\nwhich is the climax of realism, because it means that even the ideas and\r\nemotions and volitions of man are treated as natural phenomena, that\r\ntheir causes are sought and that their effects are determined, that\r\ntheir laws are found out. To apply this realistic knowledge of the mind\r\nin the interest of therapy is merely to use it in the same way in which\r\nthe engineer uses his knowledge of physics, when he wants to harness\r\nouter nature. As that is possible only when theoretical science has\r\nreached a certain height of development, it can indeed be said that\r\npractical psychotherapy on a scientific basis can be considered almost\r\nas the ultimate point of a realistic movement; it cannot set in until\r\npsychology has reached high development, and psychology cannot set in\r\nunless biology has preceded it.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that we are still far from this last phase of the\r\nrealistic period. The practical application of scientific psychology is\r\nstill a new problem. Experimental psychology began about twenty-five\r\nyears ago; at that time there existed one psychological laboratory.\r\nTo-day there is no university in the world which does not have a\r\npsychological workshop. But laboratories for applied psychology are only\r\narising in these present days, and the systematic application of\r\nscientific psychology to education and law and industry and social life\r\nand medicine is almost at its beginning. While the height of the last\r\nrealistic wave was in the period of the sixties, seventies, and\r\neighties, of the last century, its last phase, the practical application\r\nof physiological psychology, including psychotherapy, is only at its\r\ncommencement.\r\n\r\nBut while this last great movement has not yet reached its end, the new\r\nidealistic movement to come has not yet reached a clear self-expression.\r\nA general philosophical interest can be felt, but a great philosophical\r\nsynthesis seems still lacking. A new sense of duty can vaguely be felt,\r\nbut great new tasks have not yet found common acknowledgment. Above all,\r\nthe unshaped emotionalism of the masses has not yet been brought into\r\nany real contact with the new idealism which grows up on the higher\r\nlevel of scholarly thought. But it is evident, if a new great mood of\r\nidealism is to come, one of its popular forerunners must be the demand\r\nthat the spirit is real in a higher sense than matter, that the mind\r\ncontrols the body, that faith can cure. In such unphilosophic crudeness,\r\nno definite thought is expressed, as everything would depend on the\r\ndefinition of spirit, of faith, of mind, of reality. Moreover, every\r\ninquiry would prove that the idealistic value of such statements as are\r\nafloat among the masses to-day is reached only by a juggling with words.\r\nThat faith can cure appears to point towards the higher world, as the\r\nword faith has there the connotation of the faith in a religious sense;\r\nand yet the faith which really cures a digestive trouble, for instance,\r\nis the faith in the final overcoming of the intestinal disturbance, an\r\nidea which belongs evidently in the region of physiological psychology,\r\nbut not in the region of the church. Yet, however clumsy such statements\r\nmay be, they are surely controlled by the instinctive desire for a new\r\nidealistic order of our life, and the time will come when their\r\nunreasoning and unreasonable wisdom will be transformed into sound\r\nphilosophy without losing its deepest impulse. The realistic conviction\r\nthat even the mind is completely controlled by natural laws and the\r\nidealistic inspiration that the mind of man has in its freedom mastery\r\nover the body, are thus most curiously mixed in the popular\r\npsychotherapy of the day, and too few recognize that the real meaning of\r\nmind is an entirely different one in these two propositions.\r\n\r\nOf course the one or the other of these two elements prevails in the\r\nsystematic treatises on the subject; the realistic one in those written\r\nby the psychiatrists, the idealistic one in those written by clergymen\r\nor Christian Scientists. The literature indeed is almost entirely\r\nsupplied from these two quarters: and yet it is evident that neither the\r\none nor the other party can give to the problem its most natural\r\nsetting. The student of mental diseases naturally emphasizes the\r\nabnormal features of the situation, and thus brings the\r\npsychotherapeutic process too much into the neighborhood of pathology.\r\nPsychotherapy became in such hands essentially a study of hypnotism,\r\nwith especial interest in its relation to hysteria and similar diseases.\r\nThe much more essential relation of psychotherapy to the normal mental\r\nlife, the relation of suggestion and hypnotism to the normal functions\r\nseemed too often neglected. Whoever wants to influence the mind in the\r\ninterest of the patient, must in the first place be in intimate contact\r\nwith psychology. On the other hand, the minister's spiritual interest\r\nbrings the facts nearer to religion than they really are. That a\r\nsuggestion to get rid of toothache, or to sleep the next night, is given\r\nby a minister, does not constitute it as a religious suggestion. If the\r\nbelief in religion simply lies alongside of the belief in most trivial\r\neffects, and both are applied in the same way for curing the sick, it is\r\nevident that not the spiritual meaning of religion is responsible for\r\nthe cure, but the psychological process of believing. But if that is the\r\ncase, it is clear that here again the psychologist, and not the\r\nmoralist, will give the correct account of the real process involved.\r\nIn short, it is psychology, psychology in its scientific modern form,\r\nwhich has to furnish the basis for a full understanding of\r\npsychotherapy. From psychology it cannot be difficult to bridge over to\r\nthe medical interests, on the one side, to the idealistic ones on the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\nOur task here is, therefore, to lay a broad psychological foundation. We\r\nmust carefully inquire how the modern psychologist looks on mental life\r\nand how the inner experiences appear from such a psychological\r\nstandpoint. The first chapters of this volume may appear like a long,\r\ntiresome way around before we come to our goal, the study of the\r\npsychotherapeutic agencies. And yet it is the only possible way to\r\novercome the superficiality with which the discussion is too often\r\ncarried on; we must understand exactly how the psychological analysis\r\nand explanation of the scientist differ from the popular point of view.\r\nAfter studying in this spirit the foundation of psychotherapy, we shall\r\ncarefully examine the practical work, its methods and its results, its\r\npossibilities and its limitations. We shall inquire finally into the\r\nplace which it has to take, looking back upon its history, criticising\r\nthe present status and outlining the development which has to set in for\r\nthe future, if a haphazard zigzag movement is not to destroy this great\r\nagency for human welfare by transforming it into a source of\r\nsuperstition and bodily danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nTHE PSYCHOLOGICAL BASIS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE AIM OF PSYCHOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only safe basis of psychotherapy is a thorough psychological\r\nknowledge of the human personality. Yet such a claim has no value until\r\nit is entirely clear what is meant by psychological knowledge. We can\r\nknow man in many ways. Not every study of man's inner life is psychology\r\nand the careless mixing of different ways of dealing with man's inner\r\nlife is largely responsible for the vagueness which characterizes the\r\npopular literature of psychotherapy. It is not enough to say that a\r\nstatement is true or not true. It may be true under one aspect and\r\nentirely meaningless under another. For instance, a minister's\r\ndiscussion of man's energies may be full of deep truth and may be\r\ninspiring; and yet it may not contain the slightest contribution to a\r\nreally psychological knowledge of those energies, and would mislead\r\nentirely the physician were he to base his treatment of human energies\r\non such a religious interpretation.\r\n\r\nCan we not look from different standpoints even on any part of the\r\nouter world? I see before me the ocean with its excited waves splashing\r\nagainst the rocks and shore, I see the boats tossed on the stormy sea\r\nand I am fascinated by the new and ever new impulses of the tumultuous\r\nwaves. The whole appears to me like one gigantic energy, like one great\r\nemotional expression, and I feel deeply how I understand this beautiful\r\nscenery in appreciating its unity and its meaning. Yet would I ever\r\nthink that it is the only way to understand this turmoil of the waters\r\nbefore me? I know there is no unity and no emotion in the excited sea;\r\neach wave is composed of hundreds of thousands of single drops of water,\r\nand each drop composed of billions of atoms, and every movement results\r\nfrom mechanical laws under the influence of the pressing water and air.\r\nThere is hydrogen and there is oxygen, and there is chloride of sodium,\r\nand the dark blue color is nothing but the reflection of billions of\r\nether vibrations. But have I really to choose between two statements\r\nconcerning the waves, one of which is valuable and the other not? On the\r\ncontrary, both have fundamental value. If I take the attitude of\r\nappreciation, it would be absurd to say that this wave is composed of\r\nchemical elements which I do not see; and if I take the attitude of\r\nphysical explanation, it would be equally absurd to deny that such\r\nelements are all of which the wave is made. From the one standpoint, the\r\nocean is really excited; from the other standpoint, the molecules are\r\nmoving according to the laws of hydrodynamics. If I want to understand\r\nthe meaning of this scene every reminiscence of physics will lead me\r\nastray; if I want to calculate the movement of my boat, physics alone\r\ncan help me.\r\n\r\nAs long as we deal with outer nature, there is hardly a fear of\r\nconfusing the various attitudes; but it becomes by far more complex when\r\nwe deal with man and his inner life. We might abstract entirely from\r\næsthetic appreciation or from moral valuation, we might take man just as\r\nan object of knowledge; and yet what we know about him may be entirely\r\ndifferent in accordance with our special attitude. Each kind of\r\nknowledge may be entirely true, and yet true only from the particular\r\nstandpoint. Let us consider two extremes. If I meet a friend and we\r\nenter into a talk, I try to understand his thoughts and to share his\r\nviews. I agree or disagree with him; I sympathize with his feelings, I\r\nestimate his purposes. In short, he is for me a center of aims and\r\nintentions which I interpret: he comes in question for me as a self\r\nwhich has its meaning and has its unity. The more I am interested in his\r\nopinions, the more I feel in every utterance, in every gesture, the\r\nexpression of his will and his purposes; their whole reality for me lies\r\nin the fact that they point to something which the speaker intends; his\r\npersonality lies in his attitude towards the surroundings, towards the\r\nworld. Yet I may take an entirely different relation to the same man. I\r\nmay ask myself what processes are going on in his mind, what are the\r\nreal contents of his consciousness, that is, what perceptions and memory\r\npictures and imaginative ideas and feelings and emotions and judgments\r\nand volitions are really present in his consciousness. I watch him to\r\nfind out, I observe his mental states, I do not ask whether I agree or\r\ndisagree; his will is for me now not something which has a meaning, but\r\nsimply something which occurs in his inner experience; his ideas now\r\nhave for me no reference to something in the world, but they are simply\r\ncontents of his consciousness; his memories now are for me not symbols\r\nof a past to which he refers, but they are present pictures in his mind;\r\nin short, what I now find is not a self which shows itself in its aims\r\nand purposes and attitudes, but a complex content of consciousness which\r\nis composed of numberless elements. I might say in the first place that\r\nmy friend was to me a subject whom I tried to understand by interpreting\r\nhis meaning, and in the second case, an object which I understand by\r\ndescribing its structure, its elements, and their connections.\r\n\r\nBoth ways of looking on man are constantly needed. We might alternate\r\nbetween them in any experience. In the heat of argument, my friend will\r\ncertainly be for me the subject with whose meanings I try to agree or\r\ndisagree, whose emotions carry me away, whose ideas open the world to\r\nme. Yet in the next moment, I may notice that his ideas were shaped and\r\ndetermined by certain earlier experiences; that they linked themselves\r\nin memory according to certain laws of mental flow; that the vividness\r\nof his ideas made him overlook certain impressions of the surroundings;\r\nand that may turn my attention to an entirely different aspect of his\r\ninner life. His feelings and emotions, his volitions and judgments now\r\nhave for me simply the character of processes which go on and which are\r\nobserved, which coincide and which succeed each other, which fuse and\r\noverlap, and which are composed of smaller parts. My interest is now no\r\nlonger in the meaning and intentions of this self, but it belongs to the\r\nstructure and the connections in this system of mental facts. At first,\r\nI wanted to understand him by living with him, by participating in his\r\nattitudes, and by feeling with his will; now I want to understand him by\r\nexamining all the processes which go on in his consciousness, by\r\nstudying their make-up and their behavior, their elements and their\r\nlaws. In one case I wanted to interpret the man, and finally to\r\nappreciate him; in the other case I wanted to describe his inner life,\r\nand finally to explain it. The man whose inner life I want to share I\r\ntreat as a subject, the man whose inner life I want to describe and\r\nexplain I treat as an object.\r\n\r\nI might express these two standpoints still otherwise. If my neighbor is\r\nto me a subject, for instance, in the midst of an ordinary conversation,\r\nhe comes in question only with reference to his aims and meanings:\r\nwhatever he utters has a purpose and end. I understand his inner life by\r\ntaking a purposive point of view. On the other hand, the man whose inner\r\nlife is to me an object can satisfy my interest only if I understand\r\nevery particular happening in his mind from its preceding causes. I\r\ntransform his whole life into a chain of causes and effects. My\r\nstandpoint is thus a causal one. No doubt in our daily life, our\r\npurposive interest and our causal interest may intertwine at any moment.\r\nI may sympathize with the hopes and fears of my neighbor in a purposive\r\nway, and may yet in the next moment consider from a causal standpoint\r\nhow these emotions of his are perhaps affected by his fatigue or by some\r\nglasses of wine, or by a hereditary disposition, or by a suggestion; in\r\nshort, at one time I look out for the meaning of the emotion as a part\r\nof the expression of a self, and at another time for the structure and\r\nappearance of the emotion as a part of a causal chain of events. In both\r\ndirections I can go on with entire consistency, and there cannot be any\r\npart of inner experience which cannot be fully brought under either\r\npoint of view. How far we have a right to mix the two standpoints in\r\npractical life, we shall carefully examine; but it is clear that if we\r\nwant to understand the true meaning of the study of inner life, we have\r\nno longer any right carelessly to mix the two standpoints without being\r\nconscious of their fundamental difference. We must understand exactly\r\nwhat the aim of the one and of the other is, and where each has its\r\nparticular value; science certainly has no right to throw together such\r\ndifferent views of life. And now this may be said at once: the causal\r\nview only is the view of psychology; the purposive view lies outside of\r\npsychology.\r\n\r\nSuch a separation does not at all aim to indicate that the one view is\r\nmore important than the other, or that the one has more scientific\r\ndignity than the other; both yield us truth, and both may be carried\r\nfrom the simplest and most trivial observations of daily life to the\r\nhighest elaborations of scholarship. To those who are inclined to give\r\nall value and all credit only to the strictly psychological view, it may\r\nbe replied at once that surely our most immediate life experience is\r\ncarried on by the non-psychological attitude. If we love our family and\r\nlike our friends, and deal with the man of the street, we are certainly\r\nmoving in a world of purposive reality. We try to understand each other,\r\nto agree and to disagree, to be in sympathy and antipathy, without\r\nasking how those volitions and feelings and ideas of other people are\r\nbuilt as mental structures, and from what causes they arose; we are\r\nsatisfied to understand what they mean. In the same way with ourselves.\r\nWe live our lives by hinging them on our aims and purposes and ideas,\r\nand do not ask ourselves what are the causes of our attitudes and of our\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nThis purposive view has in no respect to disappear if we move on from\r\nour personal intercourse to a scholarly study of reality. The historian,\r\nfor instance, who tries to understand the will relations of humanity, is\r\nthe more the true historian the more he sticks to this purposive view of\r\nman. The truth which he seeks is to interpret the personalities, to\r\nunderstand them through their attitudes, to make their will living once\r\nmore, and to link it by agreement and disagreement, by love and hate,\r\nwith the will of friends and enemies, groups and parties, nations and\r\nmankind. It is only a loose popular way of speaking, if this purposive\r\nanalysis of a character is often called psychological. In a stricter\r\nsense of the word, it is not psychological. If the historian really were\r\nto take the psychological attitude, he would make of history simply a\r\nsocial psychology, seeking the laws of the social mind, and treating the\r\nindividual, the hero, and the leader, merely as the crossing-point of\r\npsychological law. For such a psychological view the mental life of the\r\nhero would not be more important or more interesting than the mental\r\nlife of a scoundrel, and the psychology of the king would not draw his\r\ninterest more than the psychology of the beggar. The historian has to\r\nshape all that from an entirely different standpoint: his scientific\r\ninterest depends upon the importance of men's attitudes and actions, and\r\nsuch importance refers to the world of purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, we have to stick to the non-psychological point of view\r\nwhenever man's life, his thoughts and feelings and volitions, are to be\r\nmeasured with reference to ideals; that is in ethics and æsthetics and\r\nlogic, sciences which ask whether the volitions are good or bad, whether\r\nthe feelings are valuable or worthless, whether the thoughts are true or\r\nfalse. The psychologist does not care; just as the botanist is\r\ninterested in the weed as much as in the flower, the psychologist is\r\ninterested in the causal connections of the most heinous crime not less\r\nthan in those of the noblest deed, in the structure of the most absurd\r\nerror not less than in that of the maturest wisdom. Truth, beauty, and\r\nmorality are thus expressions of the self in its purposive aspect.\r\n\r\nWe can go one step further. Those who narrowly seek every truth only in\r\nthe scientific understanding, ought to be reminded that this seeking for\r\ncausal connections is itself, after all, only a life experience which as\r\nsuch is not of causal but of purposive character. \"Life is bigger than\r\nthought.\" In the immediate reality of our purposive life we aim towards\r\nmastering the world by a causal understanding, and for this end we\r\ncreate science; but this aim itself is then a purpose and not an object.\r\nThe first act is thus for us, the thinkers, not a part of the causal\r\nevents, but a purposive intention towards an ideal. Therefore, our\r\npurposes have the first right; they represent the fundamental reality;\r\nthe value of causal connections and thus of all scientific and\r\npsychological explanation, depends on the value of the purpose. Causal\r\ntruth can be only the second word; the first word remains to purposive\r\ntruth. From this point of view we may understand why there is no\r\nconflict between the most consistent causal explanation of mental life\r\non the one side, and an idealistic view of life on the other side; yes,\r\nwe can see that the fullest emphasis on a scientific psychology--which\r\nis necessarily realistic and, to a certain degree, materialistic--is\r\nfully embedded in an idealistic philosophy of life, and that without\r\nconflict. And we shall see how this consistency in sharply separating\r\nthe psychological view from the non-psychological, secures much greater\r\nsafety for true idealism than the inconsistent popular mixing of the\r\ntwo principles, where scientific psychology is constantly encroached\r\nupon by demands of faith and religion, and where faith and religion seem\r\nconstantly in danger of being overturned by new discoveries in\r\nphysiological psychology. We may, indeed, remove from the start the\r\nmistaken fear that a consistent causal aspect of life leads to injustice\r\nto the higher aims and ideal purposes of mankind. If we want to have\r\npsychology,--and that means if we want to consider the mental life in a\r\nsystem of causes and effects,--we must proceed without prejudices, and\r\nwithout side-thoughts.\r\n\r\nFrom a psychological standpoint our own mental life and that of our\r\nneighbor, that of the man and that of the child, that of the normal and\r\nthat of the insane, that of the human being and that of the animal, are\r\nto be considered as a series of mental objects. They are to be analyzed,\r\nand to be described, and to be classified and to be explained, just as\r\nwe deal with the physical objects in the outer world. How are these\r\nobjects of the psychologist different from the objects of the physicist,\r\nfrom the pebbles on the way and the stars in the sky? There is only one\r\nfundamental difference and all other differences result from it. Those\r\nouter objects which we call physical, are objects for everybody. The\r\nstar which I see is conceived as the same star which you see, the table\r\nwhich I touch is the table which you may grasp, too. But every psychical\r\nobject is an object for one particular person only. My visual impression\r\nof the star, that is, my optical perception, is a content of my own\r\nconsciousness only, and your impression of the star can be a content of\r\nyour consciousness only. We both may mean the same by our ideas, but I\r\ncan never have your perception and you can never have my perception. My\r\nideas are enclosed in my mind. I may awaken in your mind ideas which\r\nhave the same purpose and meaning, but they are new copies in your mind.\r\nWe both may be angry, but your anger can never be my anger, and your\r\nvolitions can never enter my mind. Every possible psychical fact thus\r\nexists in one consciousness only, while every physical fact exists for\r\nevery possible consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe psychologist's final task is to explain the appearance and\r\ndisappearance, the connections and sequences of these mental objects,\r\nthe contents of consciousness. But before he can start on explanation of\r\nthe facts, he has to describe them, and describing means analyzing them\r\ninto their elements and fixating those elements and their combinations\r\nfor an exact report. Such descriptive work is in a way preparatory for\r\nthe further task of real explanation; yet it is in itself important,\r\ncomplicated, and difficult. Of course, it may be easy to separate the\r\ncomplex content into some big groups of facts, to point out that this is\r\na memory idea and this an imaginative idea and the other an abstract\r\nidea, and this a perception and that a feeling, this an emotion and that\r\na volition. But such clumsy first discrimination does not go further,\r\nperhaps, than does the naturalist's, who tells us that this is a\r\nmountain and that a tree, this a pond and that a bird. The real\r\ndescription would demand, of course, an exact measurement of the height\r\nof the mountain and the geological analysis of its structure, or an\r\nexact classification of the tree and the bird, with a complete\r\ndescription of their organs, and in each organ the various tissues have\r\nto be described, and in each tissue the various cells, and the\r\nmicroscopist goes further and describes the structure of the cell.\r\nCertainly in the same way the psychologist has to go on to resolve every\r\none of those complex structures; he has to examine the mental tissues\r\nand the mental cells of which a volition or a memory idea or a\r\nperception are composed. And while he cannot use a microscope for these\r\nmental elements, yet his studies may cause elements to appear which the\r\nnaïve observation remains entirely unaware of.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he finds in his consciousness the perception of the table before\r\nhim which lingers for a little while in his mind. He finds no difficulty\r\nin analyzing it into color sensations and tactual sensations; and yet he\r\nis aware of so much more in it. The table, for instance, has form for\r\nhim and he may find that these form perceptions involve the sensations\r\nof the eye movements which he makes from one corner of the table to the\r\nother; he may find that if the idea lasts in him, he becomes aware of\r\nthe time by sensations of tension; he finds that in his perception of\r\nthe table lies an idea of its use, and he discovers that that is made up\r\nof elements which are partly memory reproductions of earlier\r\nimpressions, partly sensations of movement impulses; he also finds that\r\nthe table feels smooth, and he discovers by his analysis that this\r\nimpression of smoothness results from a special combination of tactual\r\nsensations and movement sensations; and again those movement sensations\r\nhe analyzes further into sensations of muscle contraction and sensations\r\nof pressure in the joints and sensations of tension in the tendons.\r\nBefore a zoölogist has completed his description of a bird in the\r\nlandscape, he has given account of hundreds of thousands of things; but\r\nbefore the psychologist would complete the enumeration of the mental\r\nelements which enter into the seeing of the table, he would have to give\r\naccount of by far more psychical elements. Every point in the surface of\r\nthe table has its own light value, perhaps different in its quality and\r\nintensity and saturation, in its hue and tint and shade from the next\r\none, and at whatever point of the table's edge our attention is\r\ndirected, each one involves numberless shades in the vividness of all\r\nthe other points and numberless mental relations of space perception\r\namong the various parts of the table. In the thorough analysis of the\r\ndescribing psychologist, every single idea, and in the same way, every\r\nsingle emotion or feeling or judgment becomes complex like a living\r\norganism, an aggregate of thousands of mental tissues, and yet made up\r\nfrom \"the stuff that dreams are made of.\"\r\n\r\nBut there is one particular difficulty which makes the psychological\r\ndescription so much harder than that of the physicist, and which gives\r\nrise to many disagreements and discussions in psychological literature.\r\nThe psychologist has not only to tear the complex into pieces and thus\r\nto seek the elements, but he has to fixate those elements for the\r\npurpose of communication, as, of course, a scientific description\r\ndemands that he be able to give account to others of what he\r\nexperiences. The physicist has no difficulty whatever in that line\r\nbecause, as we saw, the world of physical things is the world which all\r\nmen are sharing together. Every element which I find in it, I can show\r\nto every other person, and if I cannot show that particular thing,\r\nbecause I cannot yet carry the mountain to another place, then I can at\r\nleast measure it, as we share those standards of space. Thus natural\r\nscience has in its objective measurements the possibility of describing\r\nevery part of the physical world. The psychical world, on the other\r\nhand, is as we saw, the world which is private property. Every effort at\r\ndescription is thus entirely in vain as long as our mental facts cannot\r\nsomehow be linked with physical happenings. If I say that I have in my\r\nmind sweetness or sourness, or bitterness or saltness, I cannot carry\r\nany understanding to anyone else and therefore cannot give any\r\ndescription until I have agreed that I mean by sweetness the sensation\r\nwhich sugar gives me, and by saltness the sensation of salt. The sugar\r\nand salt I can point out to my neighbor and only in that way I\r\nunderstand what he means if he says that he tastes salt and sweet;\r\notherwise I should have no means whatever to discriminate whether that\r\nwhich he calls a sweet taste sensation is not just what I call headache.\r\nWhere no such direct relation for a physical thing is known, description\r\nof the mental element would remain impossible. Of course, every\r\nperception of the outer world, all our seeing and hearing, and touching\r\nand tasting, offers us at once such definite connection between the\r\ninner experience and a piece of the physical universe. Our own organism\r\nis also such a piece of physical nature: just as I describe my tasting\r\nor touching, I may describe the perception of my arms and legs or my\r\ninner organs. Thus everything which is material of perception gives us a\r\nhandle for a real psychological description. Psychology usually calls\r\nthe elements of these perceptions sensations. Whatever is composed of\r\nsensations is thus describable.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, no other way of description is open. If there were\r\nmental states which are composed of other elements than sensations, they\r\nwould necessarily remain indescribable; we could not grasp them because\r\nthey would not have any definite relation to the common physical world.\r\nWe might say, for instance, that our mental content is made up of\r\nsensations and feelings, but if such feelings were really entirely\r\ndifferent from sensations, they would have to remain for all time\r\nmysterious and unknown. We could not compare notes. The feeling which I\r\ncall joy may feel just like the one which you call despair. The\r\nconsistent development of modern psychology and its emancipation from\r\nvagueness and superficial analysis became possible only through the fact\r\nthat such recourse to indescribable elements has become unnecessary.\r\nModern psychology has been able to demonstrate more and more that the\r\nsame elements which constitute our perceptions are also the elements of\r\nthe other contents of consciousness. In other words modern psychology\r\nhas recognized that the volitions and emotions and feelings and\r\njudgments, and the whole stream of inner life, are made up of\r\nsensations. Millions of sensations in all degrees of vividness and\r\nclearness, of intensity and fusion, in endless manifoldness of rhythms\r\nand relations constitute their whole content. It is a discovery quite\r\nsimilar to the one which chemistry made when it found that the same\r\nelements which are part of the inorganic substances are also the only\r\npossible elements of the organic world.\r\n\r\nFrom a strictly psychological standpoint, the ideas and the not-ideas\r\ncontain thus nothing but sensations. Their grouping, their shading,\r\ntheir combination, their succession decide whether we have before us a\r\nperception or an imagination, a volition or an emotion. What are we\r\nourselves then for the psychologist? Evidently we ourselves belong also\r\nto the inner experiences which we know; and psychology has succeeded in\r\nanalyzing this idea of our own self just in the same way as it analyzes\r\nour idea of the moon. In this analysis, psychology finds its idea of the\r\nself as a content of consciousness crystallized about the sensations\r\nfrom the body. Every one of our bodily activities is represented in our\r\nconsciousness by movement sensations, and these sensations form the core\r\nof the complex aggregate which develops into the idea of ourselves.\r\nOrganic sensations from our inner organs, pain sensations and pleasure\r\nsensations fuse with the movement sensations, and the whole complex\r\nshapes itself slowly into the idea of the personality of the self in\r\ncontrast to the idea of other personalities. We ourselves are for\r\nourselves a complex combination of sensations; and yet all our feelings\r\nand emotions and volitions are only a part of it. Psychology thus\r\nnecessarily considers those experiences of feeling and will and\r\ncharacter simply as changes in the midst of that central experience of\r\npersonality which is itself made up of bodily sensations. Each bit of\r\nwill and emotion must be decomposed into its finest elements. There is\r\nno passing mood, and no floating half-thought in our mind, no dream and\r\nno intuition, no slightest change of attention, no instinct and desire\r\nwhich cannot be analyzed thus into its sensation elements or rather\r\nwhich must not be analyzed, if we are to describe it at all, and that\r\nmeans if we are to give a psychological account. Psychology is endlessly\r\nfar from this ideal to-day. It has been claimed, not without justice,\r\nthat psychology has reached to-day only the level which physics attained\r\nin the seventeenth century; but psychology must insist that its ideal\r\nlies in this direction. No one takes a real psychological view of the\r\nhuman mind who does not understand this endless complexity of the\r\nmaterial, and who does not see that even the simplest mental state\r\npractically presents a most complex problem to scientific analysis. The\r\nphysician who really aims towards scientifically exact influence on the\r\nhuman mind has reached the first step of his preparation as soon as he\r\nunderstands that the content of consciousness is composed of hundreds\r\nof thousands of elements. To treat the mind as if there were only a few\r\nlarge pieces, one thing called memory and one thing called will and one\r\ncalled emotion and so on, is as if a surgeon were to perform an\r\noperation, knowing that there are arms and legs, but not knowing the\r\nramifications of the nerves and blood-vessels which his knife may\r\ninjure. Yet the description of these complex facts is only the beginning\r\nof psychology. We saw that the real aim is their explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nMIND AND BRAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe central aim of the psychologist must be to explain the mental facts.\r\nIt is not sufficient to describe the procession of mental experiences in\r\nus, we must understand the causes which determine that now this and now\r\nthat appears and disappears, and appears just in this combination of\r\nelements. The astronomer is not satisfied with describing the stars, he\r\nwants to explain their movements and to determine which movements are to\r\nbe expected. The psychologist, like the naturalist, aims towards\r\nexplanation, and it is this demand which forces him to look from the\r\npsychical facts to the physical ones, from the mind to the brain. He is\r\nunder an illusion if he fancies that he can explain mental facts by\r\nthemselves. The purposive mind has its connection in itself, the causal\r\npsychological mind demands for its connection the body. To understand\r\nthis necessity is the first step towards understanding the relation of\r\nmind and brain.\r\n\r\nThe psychologist's problem of explanation is in one way entirely\r\ndifferent from that of the physicist. The physicist finds a world of an\r\nunlimited number of atoms which are ultimately conceived as all alike,\r\nbut each one in a different place, and all the changes in the universe,\r\nthe movements of the stars, the waves of the ocean, are to be explained\r\nby the causal connections of the movements of these atoms. The\r\npsychologist, on the other hand, finds an endless manifoldness of\r\nelements which are not in space, and which have no space form whatever.\r\nMy will is neither triangular nor oval; my emotion is neither shorter\r\nthan five feet nor longer; my memory image of a melody has no thickness\r\nand no tallness; my contents of consciousness are as such not in space;\r\ntheir elements cannot pass through any space movements like the atoms of\r\nthe physicist. Instead of it, the psychical atoms, the sensations, have\r\ndifferent qualities, are blue and green, and cold and warm, and sweet\r\nand sour, and toothache and headache. The changes which go on in such a\r\nsystem are thus not changes of position and movements, but changes in\r\nkind and strength and vividness and fusion; and exactly such changes are\r\nthe processes which the psychologist wants to explain. He wants to make\r\nus understand why this idea grows up and the other fades away, why this\r\nimpression stands out with clearness as an attended object while the\r\nother lacks vividness and disappears, why this volition grows out of\r\nthat emotion, why this feeling leads to this imaginative thought.\r\n\r\nThe first step towards such explanation is, of course, in psychology, as\r\nin all other sciences, the careful observation of regularities. It\r\nquickly leads us to formulate some general laws. Psychology has known,\r\nfor instance, for two thousand years, that if we have perceived two\r\nthings together, and later we see the one again, the new perception\r\nbrings us a memory image of the other thing. If we saw a man's face and\r\nheard at the same time his name, seeing his face may later awaken in us\r\nthe memory of his name, or the hearing of his name may later awaken in\r\nus a reproduced memory image of his face. On such a basis, for instance,\r\nwe formulate some general laws of association of ideas, and as soon as\r\nwe have such laws laid down, we consider the appearance of such a memory\r\nimage by association as sufficiently explained. We feel that it gives us\r\nsufficient basis to predict that in the future this idea will stir up in\r\nus the other idea. Psychology has formulated plenty of such general\r\nstatements, and they serve well for a first orientation.\r\n\r\nYet can this ever be considered as a last word of scientific explanation\r\nof psychical facts? Can psychology really in this way reach an ideal\r\nsimilar to that of scientific astronomy or chemistry? Would the\r\nscientist of nature ever be satisfied with this kind of explanation,\r\nwhich is nothing but generalization of certain sequences? Does not the\r\nexplanation of the naturalist contain an entirely different element? He\r\ndoes not merely want to say that this effect has sometimes been observed\r\nand that there is thus probability that it will come again, when similar\r\ncauses are given. No, the physicist wants to understand those\r\nconnections of cause and effect as necessary ones. He tries to find\r\nsequences which cannot be otherwise because they cannot be thought in\r\nany other way. Therefore he is not satisfied with complex regularities,\r\nbut analyzes them until he can bring them down to simple physical\r\nconnections, and these physical connections finally to mechanical\r\nprocesses, which realize for us logical necessities. That matter lasts\r\nand cannot disappear is such a presupposition, which comes to us with\r\nthe necessity of logical thinking. We simply cannot think it otherwise.\r\nAnd the whole idea of natural science is to conceive the physical\r\nuniverse in such a way that all changes in the outer world can be\r\nunderstood as the movements of its parts in accordance with such\r\nnecessary physical axioms. If we knew all the atoms of the present\r\nstatus of the universe, and we knew every present movement of every\r\natom, we should be able to foresee the position of every atom in the\r\nnext moment and in the following moment and in all following moments,\r\nand all that by the necessary continuation of the substance and its\r\nenergies. That alone is the background of all special physical inquiry,\r\nand we rely on the special laws of physics and chemistry, because we\r\ntrust that this universe, as a whole, could be ultimately understood as\r\nsuch a system of necessary changes in the positions of the lasting\r\natoms.\r\n\r\nFor the psychologist there is no hope of finding such necessity in the\r\nmental processes. The point is not that psychology is to-day too far\r\nremoved from the fulfillment of such an ideal, the point is rather that\r\nsuch an ideal would be meaningless for the psychologist. His materials,\r\nthe psychical contents of consciousness, are by their nature unfit to\r\nenter into such necessary connections; they cannot do it because they\r\ncannot last. The physical object, we saw, is the object which is common\r\nproperty, which we all feel in common, which must thus exist for all\r\ntime. The things in nature may burn down or decay, but no atom of them\r\ncan ever disappear from the universe, each must enter into new and ever\r\nnew combinations and last through all changes. The psychical thing, on\r\nthe other hand, can exist only for the one immediate experience. Every\r\nsensation which enters into my ideas or volitions or emotions is a new\r\ncreation of the instant which cannot last; each one flashes up and is\r\nlost with the moment's experience. My will to-day may have the same aim\r\nas my will of yesterday, but as psychical object, my will to-day is a\r\nnew will, is a new creation in every pulse beat of my life. I must will\r\nit again, I cannot store it up. And my joy of to-day can never be as\r\npsychical fact the same joy which I may have to-morrow. Mental objects\r\nas such, as psychological material, are not destined to last. It has no\r\nmeaning whatever to think of their being kept over until another time.\r\nIt is a coarse materialism to conceive the mental contents like pebbles\r\nwhich may remain on the road from one day to another. Our ideas and\r\nfeelings are mental appearances which have their existence in the act of\r\nthe one experience; each new experience must be an entirely new\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\nIf I remember my last year's perception, I do not dig it out from an\r\nunder-mind, in which it was stored up and buried, but I create an\r\nentirely new memory picture, just as I may make to-day a speech which\r\nsays the same thing which I said last year, and yet my action of\r\nspeaking is not last year's speech movement. It is a new action, and the\r\nmovement did not lie over somewhere during the interval. Mental life is\r\nproduced anew in every moment. When the first experience is gone and the\r\nsecond comes, nothing of the stuff from which the first was made still\r\nhas existence in the content of consciousness. By this fact it becomes\r\nentirely impossible ever to conceive necessary connections in the sense\r\nof physical necessity in the world of consciousness. The one idea may\r\nbring to me another idea by association, but as long as I consider both\r\nstrictly as mental facts, I can never understand why this association\r\nhappens, I can never grasp the real mechanism of the connection, I can\r\nnever see necessity between the disappearance of the one and the\r\nappearance of the other. It remains a mystery which does not justify any\r\nexpectation that the same sequence will result again. Whatever belongs\r\nto the psychical world can never be linked by a real insight into\r\nnecessity. Causality there remains an empty name without promise of a\r\nreal explanation.\r\n\r\nOnly when we have recognized this fundamental difficulty in the efforts\r\nfor psychological explanation, can we understand the way which modern\r\npsychology has taken most successfully. The end of this way is simply\r\nthis: every psychical fact is to be thought of as an accompaniment of a\r\nphysical process and the necessary connections of these physical\r\nprocesses determine, then, the connections of the mental facts. Indeed\r\nthis has become the method of modern psychology. It has brought about\r\nthe intimate relation between psychology and the physiology of the\r\nbrain, and has given us, as foundation, the theory of psychophysical\r\nparallelism; the theory that there is no psychical process without a\r\nparallel brain process. But the real center of the theory lies indeed in\r\nthe fact which we discussed; it lies in the fact that we cannot have any\r\nexplanation of mental states as such at all, if we do not link them with\r\nphysical processes.\r\n\r\nIs it necessary to express again the assurance that such statements of a\r\nparallelism between mind and brain in no way interfere with an\r\nidealistic view of inner life? Have we not seen clearly enough that\r\nthese mental facts which are conceived parallel to physiological brain\r\nprocesses do not represent the immediate reality of our inner life, that\r\nour life reality is purposive and as such outside of all causal\r\nexplanation, and that we have to take a special, almost artificial,\r\npoint of view to consider inner life at all as objects, as contents of\r\nconsciousness, and thus as psychological material? But since we have\r\nseen that for certain purposes such a point of view is necessary, as\r\nsoon as we have taken it we must be consistent. Our inner life in its\r\npurposive reality has therefore nothing to do with brain processes, but\r\nif we are on the psychological track and consider man as a system of\r\npsychological phenomena, then to be sure, we must see that our only\r\npossible interest lies in the finding of necessary causal connections.\r\nBut these cannot be found otherwise than by linking the mental facts\r\nwith the physical ones, the psychological material with the processes of\r\nthe brain.\r\n\r\nOf course, that mental experience stands in intimate relations to the\r\nbody is a knowledge which does not wait for such philosophical\r\narguments. That mind and body come in contact is a conviction which goes\r\nwith every single sense perception. I see and hear because light and\r\nsound stimulate my sense organs, and the sense organs stimulate my\r\nbrain. The explanation of perception through causes in the physical\r\nsystem seems the more natural as it is evident that in such cases there\r\nare no psychical causes which might have brought forward the perception.\r\nIf I suddenly hear bells ringing, there was on the mental side nothing\r\npreceding which could be responsible for my sound perception. And the\r\nsame holds true if the physical source lies in my own body, if perhaps\r\nmy tooth begins to ache, although no expectation preceded it.\r\n\r\nIn the same way it seems a matter of course that mind and body are\r\nconnected wherever an action is performed. I have the will to grasp for\r\nthe book before me, and obediently my arm performs the movement; the\r\nmuscles contract themselves, the whole physical apparatus comes into\r\nmotion through the preceding mental fact. The same holds true where no\r\nspecial will act arouses the muscles. If a thought is in my mind and it\r\ndischarges itself in appropriate words, those words are after all as\r\nphysical facts the movements of lips and tongue and vocal cords and\r\nchest; in short, a whole system of physical responses has set in through\r\na mental experience. But the same thought may be the starting-point for\r\nmany other bodily changes; it may make me blush, and that means that\r\nlarge groups of blood-vessels become dilated; or I may get pale, the\r\nblood-vessels are contracted. Or I may cry, the lachrymal gland is\r\nworking; or it may spoil my appetite, the membranes of my stomach cease\r\nto produce; or my muscles may tremble, or my skin may perspire; in\r\nshort, my whole organism may resound with mental excitement which some\r\nwords may set up.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only the impression of outer stimuli and the expression of\r\ninner thoughts in which mind and body come together. Daily life teaches\r\nus, for instance, how our mental states are dependent upon most various\r\nbodily influences. If the temperature of the blood is raised in fever,\r\nthe mental processes may go over into far-reaching confusion; if hashish\r\nis smoked, the mind wanders to paradise, and a few glasses of wine may\r\ngive a new mental optimism and exuberance; a cup of tea may make us\r\nsociable, a dose of bromide may annihilate the irritation of our mind,\r\nand when we inhale ether, the whole content of consciousness fades away.\r\nIn every one of these cases, the body received the chemical substance,\r\nthe blood absorbed and carried it to the brain, and the change in the\r\nbrain was accompanied by a change in the mental behavior. Even ordinary\r\nsleep at night presents itself surely as a bodily state--the fatigued\r\nbrain cells demand their rest, and yet at the same time the whole mental\r\nlife becomes entirely changed. It is not difficult to carry over such\r\nobservations of daily life to the more exact studies of the\r\npsychological laboratory and to examine with the subtle means of the\r\npsychological experiment the mental variations which occur with changes\r\nof physical conditions. We might feel, without instruments, that our\r\nideas pass on more easily after a few cups of strong coffee, but the\r\nlaboratory may measure that with its exact methods and study in\r\nthousandth parts of a second, the quickening or retarding in the flow of\r\nideas. Every subjective illusion is then excluded, our electrical\r\nclocks, which measure the rapidity of mental action and of thought\r\nassociation, will show then beyond doubt how every change in the\r\norganism influences the processes of the mind. Bodily fatigue and\r\nindigestion, physical health and blood circulation, everything,\r\ninfluence our mental make-up. In the same way it is the laboratory\r\nexperiment which shows by the subtlest means that every mental state\r\nproduces bodily effects where we ordinarily ignore them. As soon as we\r\napply the equipment of the psychological workshop, it is easy to show\r\nthat even the slightest feeling may have its influence on the pulse and\r\nthe respiration, on the blood circulation and on the glands; or, that\r\nour thoughts give impulse to our muscles and move our organs when we\r\nourselves are entirely unaware of it.\r\n\r\nAgain we may turn in another direction. Pathology shows us how every\r\nphysical disablement of the brain is accompanied by mental processes.\r\nIf the blood supply to the brain is cut off, we faint; a blow on the\r\nhead may wipe out the memory of the preceding hours, and a hemorrhage in\r\nthe brain, the bursting of a blood vessel which destroys groups of brain\r\ncells, produces serious defects in the mental content. A tumor in the\r\nbrain may completely change the personality; the bodily disease of\r\ncertain convolutions in the brain brings with it the loss of the power\r\nof speech; paralysis of the brain dissolves the whole mental\r\npersonality. Physical inhibition in the growth of the brain involves, on\r\nthe mental side, feeble-mindedness and idiocy. Of course, all this is\r\nnot sufficient to bring out a definite parallelism between special\r\nmental functions and special physical processes, as the phenomena are\r\nextremely complex. If a patient who has suffered from a mental\r\ndisturbance dies, and his brain is examined, there is no simple\r\ncorrelation before us. It may be difficult to diagnose exactly the\r\nmental symptoms. If we have heard that the man was unable to read, we do\r\nnot know from that what really happened in his brain. He may not have\r\nread because he did not see the words, or because the letters were\r\nconfusing, or because he had lost memory for the meaning, or because he\r\nhad lost the impulse to speak the words, or because he felt unable to\r\nturn his attention, or because the impulse to read aloud was not carried\r\nout by his organism, or because an inner voice told him that it is a sin\r\nto read, or for many similar reasons; and yet each one represents\r\npsychologically an entirely different situation. On the other hand, on\r\nthe physical side, the destruction is probably not confined to one\r\nparticular spot. Complications have crept over to other places or the\r\ndisturbance in one part works as inhibitory influence on other brain\r\nparts, or a tumor may press on a far-removed part, or the disturbance\r\nmay be one which cannot be examined with our present microscopic means.\r\nIn short, we have always a complex mental situation and a complex\r\nphysical one, and to find definite correlations may be possible only by\r\nthe comparison of very many cases.\r\n\r\nOther methods, however, may supplement the pathological one. The\r\ncomparative anatomist shows us that the development of the central\r\nnervous system in the kingdom of animals goes parallel to the\r\ndevelopment of the mental functions, and that it is not only a question\r\nof progress along all lines. Any special function of the mind may have\r\nin certain animal groups an especially high development, and we see\r\ncertain parts correspondingly developed. The dog has certainly a keener\r\nsense of smell than the man--the part of the brain which is in direct\r\nconnection with the olfactory nerve is correspondingly much bulkier in\r\nthe dog's brain than in the human organism. Here too, of course,\r\nresearch may be carried to the subtlest details and the microscope has\r\nto tell the full story. Not the differences in the big structure, but\r\nthe microscopical differences in the brain cells of special parts are to\r\nbe held responsible. But comparison may not be confined to the various\r\nspecies of animals; it may refer not less to the various stages of man.\r\nThe genetic psychologist knows how the child's mind develops in a\r\nregular rhythm, one mental function after another, how the first days\r\nand first weeks and first months in the infant's life have their\r\ncharacteristic mental possibilities, and no mental function can be\r\nanticipated there. The new-born child can taste milk, but cannot hear\r\nmusic. The anatomist shows us that correspondingly only certain nervous\r\ntracts have the anatomical equipment by which they become ready for\r\nfunctioning. Most of the tracts at first lack the so-called medullar\r\nsheath, and from month to month new paths are provided with this\r\nphysical equipment.\r\n\r\nFinally we have the experiment of the physiologist. His vivisectional\r\nexperiments, for instance, demonstrate that the electrical stimulation\r\nof a definite spot on the surface of a dog's brain produces movements\r\nwhich we should ordinarily take as expressions of mental states,\r\nmovements of the front legs or of the tail, movements of barking or\r\nwhining. On the other hand, the dog becomes unable to fulfill the mental\r\nimpulses if certain definite parts of his brain are destroyed. The\r\nphysiologist may show from the monkey down to the pigeon, to the frog,\r\nto the ant, to the worm, how the behavior of animals is changed as soon\r\nas certain groups of nervous elements are extirpated. It is the mental\r\nemotional character of the pigeon which is changed when the physiologist\r\ncuts off parts of his brain. In short, stimulation and destruction\r\ndemonstrate, by experiments which supplement each other, that mental\r\nfunctions correspond to brain functions.\r\n\r\nThere is thus no lack of demonstration from all quarters that mental\r\nfacts and brain processes belong together; and yet, however much we may\r\ncumulate such popular and scientific observations, they would never by\r\nthemselves admit of the sweeping generalization that there cannot be any\r\nmental state which is not accompanied by a process in the central\r\nnervous system. Someone might say, to be sure, the perceptions and\r\nmemory images, the volitions and instincts and impulses, have their\r\nphysiological basis, but there remain after all acts of attention, or\r\ndecisions, or subtle feelings, or flights of imagination, which are\r\nindependent of any brain action. Here, indeed, observation cannot settle\r\nsuch a general principle. Its real hold lies in the fact with which we\r\nstarted: there is no causal connection in the mental states as such. If\r\nwe want to understand mental facts as such in a chain, of causal events,\r\nwe have first to conceive them as parallel to physical events. The\r\nprinciple of psychophysical parallelism, that is, the principle that\r\nevery psychical process accompanies a physiological change is thus not a\r\nmere result of observation. It is simply a postulate. Every science\r\nbegins with postulates and only that which fulfills such postulates has\r\nthe dignity of truth in the midst of that scientific realm. The\r\nastronomer cannot find by observation that there is no star the\r\nmovements of which are not the effects of foregoing causes. He knows it\r\nbeforehand, he demands it, he does not recognize any movement as\r\nunderstood until he has found the causes, he presupposes that such\r\ncauses exist, that no star moves simply by a magic power, and that\r\nnowhere in the astronomical universe is the chain of causality broken.\r\nHe postulates it, and where he does not discover the causes, he is sure\r\nthat he has not solved the real problem.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the psychologist who aims towards explanation of mental\r\nfacts must postulate that there cannot be any mental state which is not\r\nan accompaniment of a physical brain process, and is as such connected\r\nthrough physical means with the preceding and the following events in\r\nthe psychophysical system. Only when such a general framework of theory\r\nis built up by a logical postulate, is the way open to make use of all\r\nthose observations of the laboratory and of the clinic, of the zoölogist\r\nand of the anatomist. It is the theory which has to give the right\r\nsetting to those scattered observations. However far we may be from\r\nbeing able to point to the special brain process which lies at the\r\nbottom of the higher mental state, we know beforehand that there is no\r\nshadow of an idea, no fringe of a feeling, no suggestion of a desire\r\nwhich does not correspond to definite processes in the brain. The\r\ndetails may and must be material for diverging theories, but the\r\nconflict of such hypothetical opinions has nothing to do with the\r\ncertainty of the underlying conviction that if we knew the whole truth,\r\nwe should recognize every single mental happening as parallel to\r\nphysical processes in the nervous system. To explain mental facts means\r\nto think them as parallel to the brain processes which have their own\r\ncausal connections in the physical world.\r\n\r\nWe started, for instance, from the old observation that two impressions\r\nwhich come to our mind at the same time have a tendency to reawaken one\r\nanother; and we saw that psychology was well able to formulate these\r\nfacts in general statements of the association of ideas. But we realized\r\nthat that in itself is not really explanation. If the odor which we\r\nsmell awakes in us the name of a chemical substance, and if we now bring\r\nthis under the general heading of association of ideas, an explanation\r\nis not really given by it. That smell sensation itself is not really\r\nunderstood as a cause of those sound sensations of the word. We have no\r\ninsight into the connection of those two happenings. But the situation\r\nis entirely changed, if we consider the smell effect from the point of\r\nview of the parallelistic theory. Now the association of facts would\r\nindicate that we got the first two impressions together, because two\r\nbrain processes were going on at the same time. My nose brought me the\r\nsmell stimulus, my ear gave me the sound stimulus, each going on in a\r\nparticular center, or, to express it in a simplified schematic way, each\r\nreaching particular brain cells, and the excitement of these brain cells\r\nbeing accompanied by the particular sensations. The physiologist has\r\nmany possibilities of conceiving the further stages of the process, in\r\norder to satisfy the demand of explanation. He may say the excitement of\r\neach of these two brain cells, the one in the olfactory center, the\r\nother in the auditory center, irradiates in all directions through the\r\nfine branches of the brain fibers. Each cell has relations to every\r\nother cell in the brain; thus there is also one connecting path between\r\nthose two cells which were stimulated at once. Now if the two ends of an\r\nanatomical path are excited at the same time, the path itself becomes\r\nchanged. The connecting way becomes a path of least resistance, and that\r\nmeans that if, in future, one of the two brain cells becomes excited\r\nagain, the overflow of the nervous excitement will not now go on easily\r\nin all directions, but only just along that one channel which leads to\r\nthat other brain cell. A theory like this explains in real explanatory\r\nterms, in ways which physics and chemistry can demonstrate as necessary,\r\nthat any excitement of the odor cell runs over into the sound cell and\r\nvice versa. In short, the psychological association of ideas, which we\r\nshould simply have to accept as inexplainable fact, is thus transformed\r\ninto a connection which we understand as necessary; and the fact is\r\nreally explained.\r\n\r\nThis simple scheme of the physiology of association for a hundred years\r\nhas given a most decided impulse to the progress of psychology. As the\r\nassociation process can so easily be expressed in physiological terms,\r\nthe aim was prevalent to understand the interplay of mental life more\r\nand more as the result of association. The underlying thought of this\r\nwhole association psychology was thus a conviction that whenever two\r\nmental experiences occur together, either of them keeps the tendency to\r\nreawaken the other at a later time. Through the endless combination\r\nwhich life's impressions awaken in the mind from the first hour after\r\nbirth, the whole stream of memory images and thoughts and aims and\r\nimaginations is thus to be explained.\r\n\r\nThe whole theory of physiological associationism works evidently with\r\ntwo factors. First, there are millions of brain cells of which each one\r\nmay have its particular quality of sensation, and second, each brain\r\ncell may work with any degree of energy, to which the intensity of the\r\nsensation would correspond. If I distinguish ten thousand different\r\npitches of tone, they would be located in ten thousand different cell\r\ngroups, each one connected through a special fiber with a special string\r\nin the ear. And each of these tones may be loud or faint, corresponding\r\nto the amount of excitement in the particular cell group. Every other\r\nvariation must then result from the millionfold connections between\r\nthese brain cells. Indeed, the brain furnishes all possibilities for\r\nsuch a theory. We know how every brain cell resolves itself into\r\ntree-like branch systems which can take up excitements from all sides,\r\nand how it can carry its own excitement through long connecting fibers\r\nto distant places, and how the endings of these fibers clasp into the\r\nbranches of the next cell, allowing the propagation of excitement from\r\ncell to cell. We know further how large spheres of the brain are\r\nconfined to cells of particular function, that for instance cells which\r\nserve visual sensations are in the rear part of the brain hemispheres,\r\nand so on. Finally we know how millions of connecting fibers represent\r\npaths in all directions, allowing very well a coöperation by association\r\nbetween the most distant parts of the brain. The theories found their\r\nrichest development, when it was recognized that large spheres of our\r\nbrain centers evidently do not serve at all merely sensory states, but\r\nthat their cells have as their function only the intermediating between\r\ndifferent sensory centers. Such so-called association centers are thus\r\nlike complex switchboards between the various mental centers. Their own\r\nactivity is not accompanied by any mental content, but has only the\r\nfunction of regulating transmission of the excitement from the one to\r\nthe other. Above all their operation would make it possible that through\r\nassociative processes, the wonderful complexity of our trains of thought\r\nmay be reached.\r\n\r\nYet even the highest development of the association theories did not\r\nseem to do justice to the whole richness of the inner life. We may well\r\nunderstand through those association processes that a rich supply of\r\nmemory pictures is at our disposal, that ideas stream plentifully to our\r\nminds and enter into new and ever new combinations. But that alone is\r\nnot an account of our inner experience. If there is anything essential\r\nfor inner life, it is the attention which gives emphasis to certain\r\nstates and neglects others. And that means that certain mental contents\r\nare growing not only in strength but in vividness and clearness, and\r\nthat others are losing their vividness, are inhibited and suppressed.\r\nHere were always the real difficulties of the association theories; they\r\nseemed so entirely unable to explain from their own means why certain\r\nstates become foremost in our minds and others fade away, why some have\r\nthe power to grow and others are neglected. These facts of attention and\r\nvividness, inhibition and fading, worked almost as a temptation to give\r\nup the physiological explanation altogether and to rely on some mystical\r\npower, some mental influence which could pull and push the ideas without\r\nany interference and help from the side of the brain. Yet since we have\r\nseen that the truth of psychophysical parallelism has the meaning of a\r\npostulate which we cannot escape unless we want to give up explanation\r\naltogether, it is evident that such falling back into un-physiological\r\nagencies would be just as inconsistent as if the naturalist should posit\r\nmiracles in the midst of chemistry or astronomy. If the facts which\r\ncluster about attention cannot be understood by the simple scheme of\r\nassociationism, the demand must be for a better physiological theory.\r\n\r\nThe development of physiological psychology in recent years has indeed\r\nshown the way to such a wider theory, which furnishes the physiological\r\naccompaniment also for those experiences of attention and vividness\r\nwhich form the weakness of associationism. This new development has come\r\nup with the growing insight that the brain's mental functions are\r\nrelated not only to the sensory impressions, but at the same time to the\r\nmotor expressions. The older view, still prevalent to-day in popular\r\nwritings, made the brain the reservoir of physical stimuli, which come\r\nfrom the sense organs to the cortex of the brain hemispheres. There the\r\nperceptions arose and through associative interplay the memory pictures\r\nand the ideas of action and the feelings arose, and the whole inner life\r\nwas thus bound up with the processes in these sensorial spheres. When\r\nthe mind had done its work, finally an impulse was sent to some motor\r\napparatus in the brain which then sent off the impulse to some acting\r\nmuscles. That whole motor part was thus a kind of appendix to the brain\r\nprocess. The psychical life had nothing to do with it but to give the\r\ncommand for its action. The process in the motor part thus began when\r\nthe mental proceeding was completed. But it became clear that this view\r\nwas only the outgrowth of the strong interest which physiology took in\r\nthe sense processes. If a neutral fair account of the brain actions is\r\nattempted, there can hardly be doubt that this whole sensorial view of\r\nthe brain is only half of the story and that the motor half has exactly\r\nthe same right to consideration. The cortex of the brain, the functions\r\nof which are accompanied by mental processes, is always and everywhere\r\nnot only the recipient of sensory stimuli but at the same time the\r\nstarting point of motor impulses. That which is centripetal, leading to\r\nthe cortex, is therefore not more important for the central process than\r\nthat which is centrifugal, leading from the cortex. The cortex is the\r\napparatus of transmission between the incoming and the outgoing\r\ncurrents, between the excitements which run to the brain and the\r\ndischarges which go from the brain, and the mental accompaniments are\r\nthus accompaniments of these transmission processes. If the channels of\r\ndischarge are closed and the transmission is thus impossible, a blockade\r\nmust result at the central station and the accompanying mental processes\r\nmust be entirely different from those which happen there when the\r\nchannels of discharge are wide open. Here too all the special theories\r\nare still in the midst of tumultuous discord. Yet this new emphasis on\r\nthe motor side of the psychical process seems to influence modern\r\npsychology more and more.\r\n\r\nNobody can deny that first of all this is the necessary outcome of a\r\nbiological view of the brain. What else can be the brain's function in\r\nthe midst of nature than the transforming of impressions into\r\nexpressions, stimuli into actions? It is the great apparatus by which\r\nthe organism steadily adjusts itself to the surroundings. There would be\r\nno use whatever biologically in a brain which had connections with the\r\nsense organs, but which had no connections with the muscular system, and\r\non the other hand, a brain which had motor nerves and muscular\r\nadjustment would be entirely useless if it had not sensory nerves and\r\nsense organs connected with it. In the one case the world would be\r\nexperienced, but no response would be possible; in the other case, the\r\nmeans for response would be given, but no adjustment could set in\r\nbecause no experience of the surroundings would be possible. Adjustment\r\nevery moment demands the relation of the brain in both directions.\r\nThrough the sensory nerves the brain receives; through the motor nerves\r\nthe brain directs, and this whole arc from the sense organs through the\r\nsensory nerves, through the brain, through the motor nerves and finally\r\nto the muscles, is one unified apparatus of which no part can be thought\r\naway. The brain in itself would be just as useless for the organism as\r\nthe heart would be without the arteries and veins.\r\n\r\nWe must keep this intimate and necessary relation between the sensory\r\nand motor parts constantly in view, and must understand that there\r\ncannot be any sensory process which does not go over into motor\r\nresponse. Then only the ways are open to develop physiological views\r\nwhich give a physical basis to the processes of attention and vividness\r\nand inhibition, just as well as to the processes of memory and\r\nassociation. Such motor theories take many forms. Perhaps we shall most\r\nquickly bring the most essential factors together, if we say that full\r\nvividness belongs only to those sensations for which the channels of\r\nmotor discharge are open, while those are inhibited for which the\r\nchannels of discharge are closed; and any channel of discharge is\r\nclosed, if action is proceeding in the opposite channel. If I open my\r\nhand, the motor paths which lead to closing my fist are blocked; and if\r\nI close my fist, the channels which lead to the opening of the hand are\r\nclosed. Now if only those ideas are vivid which find the channels open,\r\nit is clear that all the ideas which would lead to the opposite action\r\nhave no chance for development; they remain inhibited, and just this\r\nrelation between the vividness of certain ideas and inhibition for those\r\nideas which lead to the opposite action is the characteristic of the\r\nprocess of attention.\r\n\r\nFrom such a point of view, the total mental life can be brought into the\r\npsychophysical scheme. We now have not two variable factors, but three,\r\nnamely, the qualities of the elements, the intensities of the elements,\r\nand, as a third, the vividness of the elements. The quality corresponds,\r\nas we saw in the association theory, to the local position and\r\nconnection of the brain cells; the intensity corresponds to the energy\r\nof the excitement; and the vividness, we may add now, corresponds to the\r\nrelation to motor channels. The whole mental life thus becomes the\r\naccompaniment of a steady process of transmitting impressions and\r\nmemories into reactions. That every experience involves millions of such\r\nelements we saw when we spoke of the description of mental life. The\r\neffort to explain mental life shows us now that this millionfold\r\nmanifoldness belongs to a system of reactions of which all parts are in\r\nsteady correlation: a moving equilibrium of unlimited complexity. Surely\r\nno one can reduce this wonderful manifoldness to those clumsy concepts\r\nwith which popular psychology is reporting the story of the mind and its\r\nrelations to the brain.\r\n\r\nIt may seem that such a psychological view of inner life annihilates\r\nthat which we feel as the most essential characteristic of our inner\r\nexperience, its unity and its freedom. In one sense that is certainly\r\ntrue. In the real life which we live and fight through, where our duties\r\nand our happiness lie, we know a unity and freedom of our personality\r\nwhich psychology must destroy. Of course that does not mean that\r\npsychology denies the truth of that freedom and unity. Moreover it would\r\ncondemn itself if it were to deny that which gives meaning to the\r\nendeavors of our life and thus also to every search for truth.\r\nPsychology claims only that we must abstract from it, when we take the\r\npsychological standpoint towards life. Freedom of our real life means\r\nthat we must know ourselves in the midst of our life work as guided by\r\naims and obligations, and that in this purposive existence of ourselves\r\nwe do not feel ourselves as determined by causes. I will the fulfillment\r\nof my ideals only because I will them. That this will itself may be the\r\neffect of foregoing causes is an aspect which does not belong to my\r\nnaïve experience. Our freedom means that in our real life our will is\r\nnot related to causes, that the point of view of causality is thus\r\nmeaningless for the value of our achievements. And the other man's will\r\ntoo comes in question for us as something to be interpreted and to be\r\nappreciated, but not to be explained by connection with causes. As long\r\nas we move in this sphere of purposive interest, we are free and deal\r\nwith free selves; but if in the midst of these free aims, the will\r\narises to consider the actions of others and of ourselves from the\r\nstandpoint of causality, then we have ourselves decided to enter a new\r\nsphere in which it would be meaningless to seek for any will which is\r\nnot determined by causes. As soon as we have chosen the psychological\r\nstandpoint and are in the midst of the work of causal reconstruction,\r\nany will which is not understood as determined by causes is simply an\r\nunsolved problem. In the midst of a causal construction, absence of\r\ncauses would never mean real freedom.\r\n\r\nIn that purposive world of immediate life experience, we also are\r\nunities inasmuch as we ourselves know us as the same in every new will\r\nof ours. We remain identical with ourselves because every purpose is\r\nposited in the midst of, and bound up with, the general purpose of\r\nourselves. And in this internal unity of meaning, nothing breaks\r\nourselves into pieces, and the whole manifold of experience is thus\r\nexpressed by a personality which knows itself in its purposive unity.\r\nBut this unity again is denied by our own intention as soon as we decide\r\nto take the causal view of inner life. The purposive unity must now\r\ntransform itself into an endless complexity, and our own self becomes a\r\ncomposite of hundreds of thousands of elements.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, all this does not mean that psychology cannot have\r\nits own consistent conception of the mind's unity and freedom. Our\r\npsychological mind is a unity because its manifold is a system in which\r\nall parts hang together. A change in any one part involves changes in\r\nthe whole system. The interrelation, to be sure, is not a strictly\r\npsychical one, for we have seen that the causal connection as such\r\nappears at the physical side. But, inasmuch as there is no psychical\r\nprocess which does not belong to a physiological one, the\r\ninterconnection of the mental facts is complete and involves the\r\ntotality of neural processes of which after all a small part only has\r\nits psychological record. We might compare those hundreds of millions of\r\nneurons in each brain with the hundreds of millions of individuals who\r\nmake up the population of the nations, and the psychical accompaniment\r\nwe might compare with the written historical record of mankind. The\r\nwritten records themselves have no direct interconnection, they are only\r\naccompaniments of what happens in these millions of men. And again only\r\nthe higher layer of the neurons in the population sees its doings\r\nrecorded in the annals of history; and yet whatever those leaders of\r\naction and thought and emotion may achieve is dependent upon and working\r\non the actions of those millions of subcortical population neurons. The\r\nhistorical record has its unity through the interrelation of all parts\r\nof historical mankind.\r\n\r\nBut after all the psychologist has no less a right to speak of freedom.\r\nOf course his freedom cannot mean exemption from causality. Whatever\r\nhappens in the psychological system must be perfectly determined by the\r\nforegoing causes. But the psychologist has good reason to discriminate\r\nbetween those actions which result from the normal psychophysical\r\nfactors and such actions as result from broken machinery. If the brain\r\nis poisoned by alcohol or in fever, if an infectious disease has\r\ndestroyed the brain cells, action is no longer the outcome of the\r\nnormal coöperation of the organs, and even those clusters of neural\r\nactivities which are accompanied by the consciousness of the own\r\npersonality lose their control of the motor outcome. The man in delirium\r\nor paralysis acts without causal connection with his past; the action\r\nis, therefore, not the product of his whole personality, and the\r\npsychologist is justified in calling the man unfree. But, whenever the\r\nmotor response results from the undisturbed coöperation of the normal\r\nbrain parts, then the inherited equipment and the whole experience and\r\nthe whole training, the acquired habits and the acquired inhibitions\r\nwill count in bringing about the reaction. This is the psychological\r\nfreedom of man. The unity of an interconnected composite and the freedom\r\nof causal determination through normal coöperation of all its parts\r\ncharacterize the only personality which the psychologist has to\r\nrecognize.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nPSYCHOLOGY AND MEDICINE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are now ready to take the first step towards an examination of the\r\nproblem of curing suffering mankind. So far we have spoken only of the\r\nmeaning of psychology, of its principles and of its fundamental theories\r\nas to mind and brain. We have moved in an entirely theoretical sphere.\r\nNow we approach a field in which everything is controlled by a practical\r\naim, the treatment of the sick. Yet our discussion of psychology should\r\nhave brought us much nearer to the point where we can enter this realm\r\nof medicine. Everything depends on the right point of entrance. That an\r\ninfluence on the inner life of man may be beneficial for his health is a\r\ncommonplace truth to-day for everybody. Every serious discussion of the\r\nquestion has to consider which influences are appropriate, and in which\r\ncases of illness the influence on inner life is advisable. The popular\r\ntreatises usually start this chapter by speaking of the \"mental and\r\nmoral\" factors; and this coupling of mental influences and moral\r\ninfluences characterizes large parts of the discussions of the Christian\r\nScientists and the Christian half-scientists. Yet we must insist that\r\nthe right entrance to psychotherapy is missed if the difference between\r\nmorality and mentality is not clearly recognized from the beginning. The\r\nconfusion of the two harms every statement. To avoid such a fundamental\r\nmistake, we had to take the long way around and to examine carefully\r\nwhat psychology really means and what it does not mean.\r\n\r\nWe know now that inner life can be looked on from two entirely different\r\nstandpoints: a purposive one and a causal one, and we have seen that\r\nthese two ways of looking on inner life bring about entirely different\r\naspects of man's inner experience, serve different aims, and stand in\r\ndifferent relations to the immediate needs of our real life. We know\r\nthat the one, the causal aspect, belongs to psychology, while the\r\nnon-psychological, the purposive aspect, belongs to our immediate mutual\r\nunderstanding in the walks of life. If the physician is to make use of\r\ninner experience in the interests of overcoming sickness, he must first\r\ndecide whether to take the causal or the purposive point of view in\r\ndealing with the patient's mind. This problem is too carelessly ignored\r\nand through that neglect arises much of the popular confusion. Of course\r\njust this carelessness becomes in some ways the ground for apparent\r\nstrength for many a superstition and prejudice. If the doors of the\r\ncausal mind and of the purposive mind are both open, and the spectator\r\ndoes not notice that there are two, any trick on thought and reason can\r\neasily be played. Whatever cannot pass through the causal door slips in\r\nthrough the other, and whatever does not go in through the door of\r\npurpose marches through the entrance of causality. With such methods\r\nanything can be proved, and the most unscrupulous doctrines can be\r\nnicely demonstrated. If we are to avoid such logical smuggling, we must\r\nsee clearly which attitude towards mental life belongs properly to the\r\ndomain of psychotherapy.\r\n\r\nBut what we have discussed now leaves little doubt as to the necessary\r\ndecision. The physician is interested in the mental life with the aim of\r\nproducing a certain effect, namely, that of health. Thus the mental life\r\nof the whole personality comes in question for him as belonging to a\r\nchain of causes and effects; whichever levers he may move, everything is\r\nto be a cause which, in accordance with causal laws, is to produce a\r\ncertain change. Inner life is thus, in the interests of medical\r\ntreatment, necessarily a part of a causal system. This means the\r\nstandpoint of scientific psychology is the only adequate one. The\r\npurposive view of inner life ought not to be in question when the\r\npatient enters the doctor's office.\r\n\r\nTo characterize the difference, it may be said at once that it is a\r\npurposive view which belongs to the minister. If the minister says to\r\nhis despairing parishioner, \"Be courageous, my friend, and be faithful,\"\r\nnothing but a strictly purposive view gives meaning to the situation.\r\nThe word friend indicates it, that one subject of will approaches\r\nanother subject of will, with the intention of sympathy and\r\nunderstanding of the attitude of the other; and the advice to be\r\ncourageous and faithful means an appeal which has its whole meaning in\r\nthe relation to aims and ends. The speaker and the hearer are both\r\nmoving in a sphere of will relations, purposes and ideals, sin and\r\nvirtue, hope and belief. To take the other extreme: if the neurasthenic\r\nin his state of depression and in his feeling of inability seeks relief\r\nfrom the nerve specialist, he too may say: \"My friend, be courageous and\r\nfaithful,\" yet his words have an entirely different purpose. They are\r\nnot appeals to a common interest of belief; they are subtle tools with\r\nwhich to touch and to change certain psychophysical processes, certain\r\nstates in mind and brain; there each word is a sound which awakens\r\ncertain mental associations, and these associations are expected to be\r\ncauses of certain effects and these effects are to inhibit those\r\ndisturbing states of emotional depression. If a few grains of sodium\r\nbromide were to produce the same effect, they would be just as welcome.\r\nThe whole consideration moves in a sphere in which only physiological\r\nand psychological processes are happening. Thus the physician may work\r\nwith the ideas of religious belief, but those ideas are then no longer\r\nreligious values but natural psychophysical material, which is to be\r\napplied whenever it appears as the right means to secure a certain\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the minister also knows, of course, that every word\r\nwhich he speaks has its psychological effect, but he abstracts from that\r\nentirely, as his belief should appeal directly to the struggling will of\r\nthe man. As minister, he is thus not a psychologist. He works with\r\nmoral means; the physician, with causal means. The view which the doctor\r\nhas to take of the man before him is therefore thoroughly psychological;\r\nwhereas that of the religious friend is thoroughly unpsychological, or\r\nbetter, apsychological. Indeed it is misleading, or at least demands a\r\nspecial kind of definition, if people say that the minister has to be a\r\ngood psychologist. It is just as misleading as the claim, which we hear\r\nso often, that for instance Shakespeare was a great psychologist. No,\r\nthe poet deals with human beings from the purposive standpoint of life\r\nand the mere resolving of complex purposes into parts of purposes is not\r\npsychology in the technical sense of the term. The poet makes us\r\nunderstand the inner life, but he does not describe or explain it; he\r\nmakes us feel with other people, but he does not make those feelings\r\ncausally understood. The realistic novelists sometimes undertake this\r\npsychological task, but they are then on the borderland of literature,\r\nthe analysis of their heroes becomes then a psychological one.\r\nShakespeare understood human beings better than anyone and therefore the\r\nmen and women whom his imagination created are so fully lifelike that\r\nthe psychologist may feel justified in using them as material for his\r\npsychological analysis, but Shakespeare himself did not enter into that\r\npsychological dissection; he kept the purposive point of view. In the\r\nsame way certainly the minister--the same holds true for the lawyer or\r\nthe tradesman or anyone who enters into practical dealings with his\r\nneighbor--may resolve complex attitudes of will into their components,\r\nbut each part still remains a will attitude which has to be understood\r\nand to be interpreted and to be appreciated, while the psychologist\r\nwould take every one of those parts as a conscious content to be\r\ndescribed and to be explained. But here we abstract from the purposive\r\nrelations. Our attention belongs now to the doctor's dealing with man;\r\nfor him cause and effect are the only vehicles of connection. Thus he\r\nhas to exclude the purposive interpretation of inner life and has to\r\nunderstand every factor involved from a psychological point of view: his\r\npsychotherapy must be thoroughly applied psychology.\r\n\r\nThe day of applied psychology is only dawning. The situation is indeed\r\nsurprising. The last three or four decades have given to the world at\r\nlast a really scientific study of psychology, a study not unworthy of\r\nbeing compared with that of physics or chemistry or biology. In the\r\ncenter of the whole movement stood the psychological laboratory with its\r\nequipment for the most subtle analysis and explanatory investigation of\r\nmental phenomena. The first psychological laboratory was created in\r\nLeipzig, Germany, in 1878. It became the parent institution for\r\nlaboratories in all countries. At present, America alone has more than\r\nfifty psychological laboratories, many of them large institutions\r\nequipped with precious instruments for the study of ideas and emotions,\r\nmemories and feelings, sensations and actions. Still more rapid than\r\nthis external growth of the laboratory psychology was the inner growth\r\nof the experimental method. It began with simple experiments on\r\nsensations and impulses, and it seemed as if it would remain impossible\r\nto attack with the experimental scheme the higher and more complex\r\npsychical structures. But just as in physics and chemistry the triumphal\r\nmarch of the experimental method could not be stopped, one part of the\r\npsychological field after another was conquered. Attention and memory,\r\nassociation and inhibition, emotion and volition, judgment and feeling\r\nall became subjected to the scientific scheme of experiment. And that\r\nwas all supplemented by the progress of physiological psychology,\r\npathological psychology, child psychology, animal psychology. In this\r\nway the last decades created a science which of course was by principle\r\na continuation of the old psychology, but yet which had good reason to\r\ndesignate itself as a \"new\" psychology.\r\n\r\nBut in this whole development, until yesterday, the curious fact\r\nremained that it was going on without any narrow contact with practical\r\nlife; it was a science for the scientist and measured by its practical\r\nachievements in daily life, it seemed barren and unproductive.\r\nPsychology was studied as palæontology and Sanscrit were studied,\r\nwithout any direct relation to the life which surrounds us. And yet\r\nafter all it deals with the mental facts which have to enter into every\r\none of our practical deeds, if we are to consider mental life from a\r\npsychological point of view. The psychologists were certainly not to be\r\nblamed for sticking to their theoretical interests. More than that,\r\nthey were certainly justified in their reluctance, as everything was in\r\nthe making, and incomplete theories can easily do more harm than good.\r\nBut slowly a certain consolidation has set in; large sets of facts have\r\nbeen secured, and psychology seems better prepared to become serviceable\r\nto the practical tasks. On the other hand, it has been noticeable for\r\nsome time that not a few of the psychological results have gone over\r\ninto unprofessional hands and have been thrown on the market places and\r\nhave been brought into many a home where no one knew how to deal with\r\nthem rightly. Thus the need seems urgent that the psychologists give up\r\ntheir over-reserved attitude and recognize it as their duty to serve the\r\nneeds of the community.\r\n\r\nIt is not sufficient for that end, simply to take odds and ends of\r\npsychology and to hand them over to anyone who can see some use for\r\nthem. We must have a systematic scientific work done for the special\r\npurpose of adjusting psychological knowledge to the definite practical\r\ntasks and of examining the psychological facts with that practical end\r\nin view. A science must be developed which is related to psychology as\r\nengineering is related to physics and chemistry. Just as the\r\ntechnological laboratories of the engineer bring out many new problems\r\nwhich the physicist would never have approached, in the same way we may\r\nexpect that special institutions for applied psychology will shape the\r\npsychological inquiry in a new way.\r\n\r\nSuch a new science of applied psychology of course has before it a\r\nfield just as large and manifold as the field of technology, where\r\nphysical engineering, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, and\r\nelectrical engineering and so on are separated. Such a future\r\npsychological technology would deal, for instance, with\r\npsychopedagogical problems. There belongs everything which refers to the\r\npsychology of memory or attention, of discipline, of fatigue, of habit,\r\nof imitation or effort; in short, all those mental factors which have to\r\nbe considered whenever the schoolchild is looked on from a causal point\r\nof view. Further there is the psycholegal field where the memory and the\r\nperceptions, the suggestibility and the emotions of the witness are to\r\nbe studied, where the psychological conditions which lead to crime, the\r\nmeans to tap the hidden thoughts of the criminal, the inhibitions for\r\nthe prevention of crime, the mental effects of punishment and similar\r\ncausal processes must be determined. There are the psychoscientific\r\nproblems referring to psychological influences on the observations and\r\njudgments and discriminations of the scholar who watches the stars or\r\nwho translates an inscription. There are the psychoæsthetic problems\r\nwhere the task is to examine causally the factors which lead to the\r\nagreeable effects of beautiful surroundings, and from the height of the\r\npsychology of æsthetics in painting and sculpture, the inquiry may go to\r\nthe psychology of the pleasant effects in dress-making or cooking. There\r\nare the large groups of psychotechnical problems where the effort refers\r\nto the application of psychology in securing the best conditions for\r\nlabor and industry and commerce. It leads from the mental effects of\r\nsignals or the mental fatigue in mills to the secrets of advertisements\r\nand salesmanship. There are especially important psychodiagnostical\r\nstudies where the aim is to determine the individual differences of man\r\nby experimental methods and to make use of them for the selection of the\r\nright man for the right place. There are psychosocial problems where we\r\nexamine the psychological factors which have to enter into public\r\nmovements, into social reforms, into legislation and into politics. In\r\nthis way new and ever new groups may be added; every time the central\r\nthought is: how far can causal psychological knowledge help us to reach\r\na certain end? Together with these forms of applied psychology, we find\r\nthe psychomedical problems; here belongs everything which allows the\r\napplication of causal psychology in the interests of health.\r\n\r\nIt might be answered that this demand for a strictly causal point of\r\nview can hardly be fulfilled, because, if I am acting,--it may be in the\r\ninterest of education or law or technique or medicine,--I must always\r\nhave an end in view and to select such an end belongs after all to my\r\nsystem of purposes. If I am a teacher and have to deal with children,\r\nthen it may be said that after all, my knowledge of causal psychology\r\ncannot help me if I am uncertain for which ideals I want to educate\r\nthese children. Psychology can tell me that I need these means, if I\r\nwant to reach certain effects, but I cannot find out by psychology which\r\neffects are desirable. Psychology may tell me how to make a good\r\nbusiness man or a good scholar or a good soldier out of my boy, but\r\nwhether I want him to become a soldier or a merchant I must decide for\r\nmyself with reference to general aims, and that leads me back to the\r\npurposive view of life. Such argument is entirely correct. Yes, it is\r\nevident that it is in full harmony with our whole understanding of the\r\npurpose of psychology. We saw that psychology with its causal treatment\r\nof man's mind does not express the immediate reality, but is a certain\r\nreconstruction which allows a calculation of certain effects. Thus it is\r\nitself a system existing for a subject who has certain ends in view. The\r\nwhole causal view of man is thus a tool in the service of the purposive\r\nman. This is the reason why it is indeed utterly absurd to think that\r\npsychology can ever help us to determine which end we ought to reach.\r\n\r\nIn education, for instance, very many different ends might be reached;\r\npsychology cannot decide anything. The decision as to the aims of\r\neducation must be made by ethics, which indeed takes not a causal but a\r\npurposive attitude. Only after ethics has selected the aim, psychology\r\ncan teach us how to reach it. Of course this principle must hold for the\r\nphysician too. All his causal dealing with the mind presupposes that he\r\nhas selected a certain end in harmony with his purpose. The only\r\ndifference is that, in the case of the physician, there can be no\r\npossible doubt as to the desirable end; what he aims at is a matter of\r\ncourse, namely, the health of the patient. To desire the health of the\r\nsufferer is thus itself a function which belongs entirely to the\r\npurposive view of the world, and only in the interest of this purpose\r\ndoes the physician apply his knowledge of psychology or of the causal\r\nsciences of physics, physiology, and chemistry. Indeed only with this\r\nlimitation have we the right to say that the psychotherapist takes the\r\ncausal,--and that means the psychological,--view of his patient. As far\r\nas he decides to take care of the health of his patient, this decision\r\nitself belongs to the purposive world and to his moral system. The\r\nphysician is thus ultimately just like the minister and just like anyone\r\nwho deals with his neighbor, a purposive worker; but while the minister,\r\nfor instance, remains on this purposive track, the physician puts a\r\ncausal system into the service of his purpose. He knows the end, and his\r\nwhole aim is to apply his causal knowledge of the physical and psychical\r\nworld to the one accepted end of restoring the health of the patient. He\r\nhas to ask thus in general: what has psychology to-day to offer which\r\ncan be applied in the interests of medicine?\r\n\r\nIt would be an inexcusable narrowness to confine that chapter of applied\r\npsychology which is to deal with the psychomedical problems to the work\r\nof psychotherapy. Medicine involves diagnosis of illness as well as\r\ntherapeutics. Between the recognition and the treatment of the illness\r\nlies the observation of its development and all this is preceded by\r\nsteps towards the prevention of illness. In every one of these regions,\r\npsychology may be serviceable. Psychotherapy is thus only one special\r\npart of psychomedicine. But the situation becomes still more complex by\r\nthe fact that the illness to be treated or the disturbance to be removed\r\nmay stand in different relations to the psychophysical processes. The\r\nillness may be a disturbance in the psychophysical brain parts, or it\r\nmay belong to other brain parts which are only in an indirect way under\r\nthe influence of mental states or which are themselves indirectly\r\nproducing changes in the mental life. And finally the disturbance may\r\nexist outside of the brain in any part of the body, and yet again\r\nthrough the medium of brain and nervous system it may produce effects in\r\nthe mind or be open to the influence of the mind. Thus we have entirely\r\ndifferent groups of medical interests and it would be superficial to\r\nignore the differences.\r\n\r\nBoth psychodiagnostic and psychotherapeutic studies must be devoted to\r\ncases in which the mind itself is abnormal, further to cases in which\r\nthe normal minds registers the abnormalities in other parts of the body,\r\nand finally to cases in which the normal mind influences abnormal\r\nprocesses in the body. These latter two cases have to be subdivided into\r\nthose where the bodily disturbance still lies in the brain parts and\r\nthose where it lies outside of the brain. But the situation becomes\r\nstill more complex by the mutual relations of those various processes.\r\nThe impulse to take morphine injections may have reached the character\r\nof a mental obsession and thus represent an abnormality of the mind, but\r\nyielding to it produces at the same time disturbances in the whole body\r\nwhich thus become again external sources for abnormal experiences in\r\notherwise normal layers of the mind.\r\n\r\nOf course the interest of the psychologist as such remains always\r\nrelated to the psychological factor, but the relation of the\r\npsychological factor itself to the total disturbance may be of most\r\ndifferent character. If I diagnose or treat the fixed idea of a\r\npsychasthenic, the psychological factor itself represents the\r\ndisturbance. On the other hand, if I study the pain sensations of a\r\npatient who suffers from a disease of the spinal cord, then the\r\nsensations themselves, the only psychological factor in the case, are\r\nonly indications of a disease which belongs to an entirely different\r\nphysical region; the mind itself is normal. Or, on the other hand, if I\r\ntry to educate a sufferer from locomotor ataxia to develop his walking\r\nby building up in his mind new motor ideas to regulate his coördinated\r\nmovements, the mind again is entirely normal but the physician needs his\r\npsychology on account of the influence which the mind has on the bodily\r\nsystem. Again, we must insist that psychomedicine covers this whole\r\nground. Wherever a psychical factor enters into the calculations of the\r\nphysician either by reason of its own abnormality or by its relation as\r\neffect or as cause to a diseased part of the body in the brain or\r\nwithout, there we have a psychomedical task, and as far as it is\r\ntherapeutic, we have psychotherapy.\r\n\r\nThe psychodiagnostic research lies outside of the compass of our book,\r\nbut we cannot emphasize sufficiently the great importance which belongs\r\nto that work. Moreover, just in the field of psychodiagnostics, the\r\nmethods of the modern experimental psychological laboratory are most\r\npromising and successful. Let us not forget that we deal with such\r\npsychological factors even when we test the functions of eye and ear and\r\nskin and nose by examining the sensations and perceptions. The oculist\r\nwho analyzes the color sensations of a patient and the aurist who finds\r\ndefects in the hearing of the musical scale and discovers that certain\r\npitches cannot be discriminated, is certainly dealing, for diagnostic\r\npurposes, with the material that the psychological laboratory has sifted\r\nand studied. Even that sensation symptom which enters into so many\r\ndiseases, the sensation of pain, belongs certainly within the compass of\r\nthe psychologist and it is only to be regretted that the systematic\r\nstudy of the pain sensations, mostly for evident practical reasons, has\r\nbeen much neglected in the psychological laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe psychologists have been at work all the more eagerly in the fields\r\nof association and memory, attention and emotion, habit and volition,\r\ndistraction and fatigue. Here subtle methods have been elaborated,\r\nmethods which surely common sense cannot supply, and which showed\r\ndifferences of mental behavior with the exactitude with which the\r\nmicroscope reveals the hidden differences of form. If physicians are\r\nslow in accepting the help which the psychological laboratory can\r\nfurnish, it may be in good harmony with the desirable conservative\r\npolicy in medicine, but finally the time must come when this\r\ninstinctive resistance against new methods will be overcome. The recent\r\nattachment of psychological laboratories to certain leading psychiatric\r\nclinics is a most promising symptom. Yet the diagnostic studies with the\r\nmeans of the psychological laboratory cannot be confined to the cases of\r\nmental disease. The mild abnormalities of the mind, and especially the\r\nnervous disturbances which exist outside the field of insanity, demand\r\nthis support of psychology much more. And even the normal personality\r\nwill be more safely protected from disease and from social dangers for\r\nits mental constitution if the resources of experimental psychology are\r\nemployed. The more we know of the psychological constitution of the\r\nindividual, the more we can foresee the development which is to be hoped\r\nfor or feared and which may be encouraged or retarded.\r\n\r\nThe psychologist may determine, for instance, the degree of attention\r\nwith its resistance against distracting stimuli, the power of memory\r\nunder various conditions and on various material, the mental\r\nexcitability and power of discrimination, the quickness and correctness\r\nof perception, the chains of associations, the rapidity of the\r\nassociative process for various groups, the types of reaction, the\r\nforming of habits and their persistence, the conditions of fatigue and\r\nof exhaustion, the emotional expressions and the emotional stability,\r\nthe time needed for recreation and the resistance against drugs, the\r\ndegree of suggestibility and the power of inhibition: and every result\r\nin any of these lines may contribute to the diagnosis and prognosis of\r\ncases. The chronoscope here measures the reaction times and association\r\ntimes in thousandths of a second; the kymograph, by the help of the\r\nsphygmograph, writes the record of the pulse and its changes in\r\nemotional states, while the pneumograph records the variations of\r\nbreathing, and the plethysmograph shows the changes in the filling of\r\nblood vessels in the limbs which is immediately related to the blood\r\nsupply of the brain. Here belongs also the ergograph, which gives the\r\nexact record of muscular work with all the influences of will and\r\nattention and fatigue, the automatograph which writes the involuntary\r\nmovements, especially also the galvanoscope which may register the\r\ninfluence of ideas and emotions on the glands of the skin, and thus lead\r\nto an analysis of repressed mental states, and hundreds of other\r\ninstruments which are used in the psychological laboratory.\r\n\r\nYet it would be misleading to think only of complex apparatus when\r\nexperimental psychology is in question. An experiment is given whenever\r\nthe observation is made under conditions which are artificially\r\nintroduced for the purpose of the observation. Thus there is no need of\r\nthe physical instrument. If I bring a spoonful of soup to my mouth at\r\ndinner and I become interested in the combination of warmth sensation\r\nand touch sensation and taste sensation and smell sensation, then I have\r\nperformed an experiment if I take one more spoonful of soup just for the\r\npurpose of the observation. The physician too may carry out important\r\npsychological experiments, without needing the outfit of a real\r\nlaboratory. Association experiments, for instance, promise to become of\r\nsteadily growing importance. To make them serviceable to the problems of\r\nhis office, nothing but a subtle psychological understanding is needed,\r\ninasmuch as any routine work schematically applied to every case alike\r\nwould be utterly useless. Give your man perhaps a hundred words and let\r\nhim speak the very first word which comes to his mind when he hears the\r\ngiven ones. You call rose, and he may say red or flower or lily or\r\nthorn; you call frog and he may answer pond or turtle or green or jump,\r\nand if you choose your hundred words with psychological insight, his\r\nhundred answers will allow a full view of his mental make-up. This is an\r\nexperiment which does not require any instruments at all but a man's\r\nsubtle analysis of the replies. That is not seldom sufficient to secure\r\nthe diagnosis of complex mental variations. The method yields still more\r\nif the time for such a reply is measured, but there again not the costly\r\nchronoscope of the laboratory is indispensable; a simple stop watch\r\nwhich gives the fifths of a second would be fully sufficient for all\r\npractical purposes. From such simple facts of the mental inventory the\r\nassociation experiments may lead to complex questions which slowly may\r\ndisentangle the confused ideas, for instance, of a dementia præcox, and\r\nthus lead to subtle differential diagnosis.\r\n\r\nThe psychological laboratory alone can also elaborate the methods of\r\nstudying, for instance, the feeble-minded with all the individual\r\nvariations. New and ever new methods have been tried; the memory was\r\ntested by reading and repeating figures or letters, or colored papers\r\nwere shown or cardboards of different forms or nonsense syllables, and\r\nthe powers of remembering were studied. Or the accuracy of arm movements\r\nwas examined, or the quickness of understanding associated words, or the\r\nsuccess in planning a complex movement like throwing a ball at a target,\r\nor the tapping of a key in the rhythm of a metronome, or the\r\ndiscrimination and recognition of the pieces in the game of dominoes and\r\nmany another scheme. The laboratory has to analyze the conditions for\r\nsuch methods and the psychologist has to prepare the means for the use\r\nof the physician, just as the chemist has to prepare the sleeping\r\npowders. In a similar way the laboratory may furnish means to analyze\r\nthe mental disturbances by a comparison with the experimental results of\r\nartificial influences, for instance, of over-fatigue or half-sleep, of\r\ndrugs or alcohol, of poisons and emotional excitements. The\r\npsychological resolving of the mental symptoms may of course, in the\r\nsame way, furnish the diagnosis where the mental variation is only a\r\ndistant effect of a bodily ailment. The changes in the emotions, for\r\ninstance, may lead to the recognition of a heart disease; lack of\r\nattention may be a hint of the overgrowth of the adenoids; irritability\r\nor apathy or delirious character of the mental behavior may indicate\r\nwhether uræmic acid is in the system or an infectious disease: anæmia\r\nand undernutrition may be diagnosed and the psychology of fever demands\r\ntoo a much closer analysis with the means of the psychological\r\nlaboratory than it has received so far.\r\n\r\nWe have not spoken as yet about those psychological methods which\r\nthemselves introduce abnormal mental states like hypnotism, and which\r\nalso not seldom are only means for diagnostic purposes. The hypnotic\r\nstate may bring to memory forgotten experiences of which the\r\nphysiological effects may have lasted in the brain and which may have\r\nbrought injury to the psychophysical system. Hypnotic inquiry can thus\r\nlead to the recognition of the first causes in many hysterical states\r\nand where hypnotism is not the best adjusted tool, a certain dreamlike\r\nstaring may be more effective. We have to return to much of that later\r\nin full detail because just for instance in hysteria, the clear\r\nrecognition of the sources and of the character of the disease may at\r\nthe same time prove to be in itself the right starting point for\r\ncurative treatment.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken so far only about the relations of psychology and\r\nmedicine from the point of view of diagnosis; the relations from the\r\npoint of view of therapy will make up the second part of this book. We\r\nshall describe the methods and the results, the possibilities and the\r\nlimitations with manifold detail. That is the chief topic of this\r\nvolume. All that is needed to prepare for this principal problem is on\r\nthe one side a preparatory clearing up of some fundamental conceptions,\r\nespecially of those two which have played the chief rôle in the whole\r\ndiscussion, namely the subconscious and suggestion. And on the other\r\nside, we may consider at first some fundamental discriminations which\r\nsteadily influence the inquiries and controversies in the field. I think\r\nof the difference between normal and abnormal mental states, between\r\npsychical and physical facts in psychotherapy, between functional and\r\norganic diseases, and to return to our starting point, between mental\r\nand moral influences.\r\n\r\nEvery curative effort presupposes that the normal state of health has\r\nbeen lost and that a diseased state has set in. Yet the mental analysis\r\nsuggests still less than the bodily inquiry, just where the normal\r\nfunctioning is really lost. It would be easy to draw a demarcation line\r\nif the pathology of the mind introduced any mental features which are\r\nunknown in our normal existence, but the opposite is true. No mental\r\ndisease introduces elements which do not occur in the sphere of health.\r\nA degenerated brain cell looks differently under the microscope from a\r\nnormal one, but the ideas of a paranoiac, the emotion of a maniac, the\r\nvolition of a hysteric, the memory idea of a paralytic is each in its\r\nown structure not different from such elements in any one of us. The\r\ntotal change lies thus only in the proportion; there is too much or too\r\nlittle of it. The pathological mental life is like a caricature of a\r\nface--each feature is contained, as in the ordinary portrait, but the\r\nproportion is distorted, there is too much or too little of chin or of\r\nnose. But who can indicate exactly the point where the distortion of the\r\nfeatures constitutes a caricature? Every grotesque change in the\r\nrelations ruins the healthy state: what makes us sure that the harmony\r\nof health is spoiled?\r\n\r\nCertainly we cannot settle it by mere statistics. The norm never means\r\nmerely a majority. Even if the overwhelmingly larger part of mankind\r\nsuffered from phthisis, the few who were free from it would be\r\nrecognized as well and all the others would be considered ill. In mental\r\nlife still more, no one ought to propose that the exceptional function\r\nis the symptom of disease. The few persons who never had a dream in\r\ntheir lives differ much in their mental experience from the large\r\nmajority and yet their peculiarity is certainly not a symptom which\r\nneeds curative treatment. The only real test of health is the\r\nserviceableness to the needs of life. We have an unhealthy state of the\r\npersonality before us wherever the equilibrium of the human functions is\r\ndisturbed in a way which diminishes the chances of existence, and the\r\nseriousness of the ailment depends upon the degree of this diminishing\r\npower. Seen from a strictly psychological point of view, we must expect\r\nthus a broad borderland region between the entirely normal well-balanced\r\nmental life and that unbalanced disorder of functions which really\r\ninterferes with the chance for self-protection and effectiveness. That\r\nthe melancholic who declines to take any nourishment, or the paranoiac\r\nwho misjudges his surroundings, is unable to secure by his own energies\r\nthe safety of his life cannot be doubted. The balance is completely\r\ndestroyed and the will and the intellect of the physician and of the\r\nnurse must be substituted for his own mental powers, if his life is to\r\nbe prolonged at all. But the misjudgment and the depression of the\r\ninsane are only an exaggeration of that which may occur in any man.\r\n\r\nThere are therefore thousands of steps which lead from the normal error\r\nor regret to the destructive disturbance. Everyone knows persons whose\r\npessimistic temperament makes them inclined to an over-frequent\r\ndepression, or others whose silly disposition brings out constantly\r\nthose emotional tendencies which the maniac shows in an exaggerated\r\ndegree. The stupid mind shows those lacks of association and connection\r\nwhich reach their maximum degree in the mind of the idiot. We know from\r\ndaily life the timid, undecided man who cannot come to a will impulse;\r\nthe hasty man who rushes towards decisions; the inattentive man who can\r\nnever focus his consciousness; and the overattentive man who can never\r\ndismiss any subject; the indifferent man on whom nothing produces\r\nevident impression and feeling; the over-sensitive man who reacts on\r\nslight impressions with exaggerated emotion; and yet every one of such\r\nand a thousand similar variations, needs only the projection on a larger\r\nscale to demonstrate a mental life which is self-destructive. The silly\r\ngirl and the stupid boy, the man who has the blues and the reckless\r\ncreature, are certainly worse equipped for the struggles of existence\r\nthan those who are intellectually and emotionally and volitionally\r\nwell-balanced. They will take wrong steps in life, they may be\r\nunsuccessful, their stupidity may lead them to the poorhouse, their\r\nrecklessness may lead them to the penitentiary. And yet we do not speak\r\nof them as patients because their disproportionate mental features may\r\nbe sufficiently corrected by other mental states which are perhaps more\r\nstrongly developed.\r\n\r\nFurther, inasmuch as human life just in its mental functions is related\r\nto its social surroundings, much must depend on the external conditions,\r\nwhether the disproportion and abnormality has to be treated as\r\npathological. The mind which may find perhaps its way under the most\r\nsimple rural conditions would be unable to protect life under the\r\ncomplex conditions of a great city. The man who in certain surroundings\r\nmay appear a crank has to be treated as a patient in a different set of\r\nlife conditions. Wherever psychotherapeutic work is in question, perhaps\r\nnothing is more important than to keep steadily in mind this continuity\r\nbetween normal and abnormal mental features. The mental disturbance must\r\nconstantly be looked upon as a change of proportions between functions\r\nwhich, as such, belong to every normal life. We have to train and to\r\ndevelop, and thus to reënforce, that which is too weak, and we have to\r\ndrain off and to suppress and to inhibit that which is too strong.\r\n\r\nYet just this functional view of disease must remind us strongly from\r\nthe beginning that it would be utterly in vain to draw any demarcation\r\nline between psychical disturbances and physical ones. We have seen from\r\nthe start that from the point of view of physiological psychology,\r\nthere can be no psychical process without an accompanying physiological\r\nprocess in the brain. Every disturbance in mental actions is thus at the\r\nsame time a disturbance in the equilibrium of nervous functions. Yet\r\nthat alone would not exclude the possibility of considering some\r\ndiseases, for instance, exclusively from the mental side, and we should\r\nbe justified in doing so if those parts of the brain which are the seat\r\nof the mental processes could remain in the diseased state without\r\ninfluence on other parts of the nervous system and of the whole body. In\r\nsuch a case it would indeed be sufficient to consider the psychophysical\r\ndisturbance from the psychological point of view only, that is, to speak\r\nof the disease as a disorder of intellect, of emotion or will, without\r\nthinking of changes in the brain cells. But such isolation does not\r\nexist in nature. Not only the bodily factors like nutrition and\r\ncirculation and sexual functions have a thousandfold influence on the\r\npsychophysical processes, and these in turn change the vegetative\r\nfunctions of the body, but especially the other parts of the brain and\r\nnervous system can be affected in most different ways. If we want to\r\nconsider whether a certain variation of the personality demands curative\r\ntreatment, we certainly cannot confine ourselves to the mental\r\nvariations. They are after all only parts of the whole group of changes\r\nin the organism and are thus symptoms of a disease which has to be\r\nstudied in its totality. The mental symptoms alone may be relatively\r\nslight variations, which in themselves might be sufficiently balanced\r\nnot to disturb the equilibrium of life, and yet they may be symptoms of\r\na brain disturbance which as a whole must interfere with the safety of\r\nlife. On the other hand, mental life may appear like a chaos and yet the\r\ndisturbance may be the symptom of merely a slight brain affection and\r\nthe treatment of the mental symptoms in their apparent severity would be\r\na useless effort. The mental disturbance, for instance, of the\r\nintoxicated or the hashish smoker, even the delirium of the feverish,\r\ndoes not suggest a fight against the mental symptoms during the attack.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, there is a far-reaching independence between the apparent\r\nmental variations and the seriousness of the brain affection. Light\r\nhysteric states may produce a strong absenting of the mind while severe\r\nepileptic conditions of the brain may be accompanied by very slight\r\nmental changes. Every neurasthenic state may play havoc with mental\r\nlife, while grave brain destructions may only shade slightly the\r\ncharacter or the intellect. To deal with the mental changes as if they\r\nbelonged to a sphere by itself, to the soul which is well or ill through\r\nits own independent alterations without steadily relating the changes to\r\nthe total organism, leads therefore necessarily to failure. The mind\r\nreflects only symptoms of the disease; the disease itself belongs always\r\nto the organism. Psychotherapy has suffered too much from the belief\r\nthat the removal of mental symptoms is a cure of disease.\r\n\r\nCertainly the psychophysical symptoms may often stand in the foreground\r\nof the disease, and in that case it may be left to the special needs\r\nwhether we deal with them as psychical or as physical changes. Even the\r\npatient may be made to see them in one or the other way in accordance\r\nwith his special needs. To tell him that his brain cells are in disorder\r\nand that they can be cured will be the right thing for him who takes\r\nonly the introspective view of his suffering and is in despair because\r\nhis own will seems powerless to overcome those mental changes. For the\r\nnext patient, the opposite may be wiser. The belief that his brain is\r\nill may have induced him to give up effort of the will instead of\r\nhelping along by steady self-suggestion. He will be helped more if he\r\nunderstands that his mind is working wrongly. But the full truth is that\r\nboth mind and body are in disorder; the function of the disturbed brain\r\ncells accompanies the ineffective will, and to reënforce the will means\r\nto bring into equilibrium again the disturbed brain cells. For the\r\npsychotherapist the temptation of giving the attention to the mental\r\nsymptoms only is strong. The more firmly the physician sticks to the\r\nstandpoint of psychophysiology, the better he will see ailment and cure\r\nin their right proportion.\r\n\r\nThis demand for the consideration of the whole personality, mind and\r\nbody, ought not to be influenced by the popular separation between\r\norganic and functional diseases. If we call organic diseases of the mind\r\nthose in which the mental disturbance is the accompaniment of a brain\r\ndisturbance, and functional those in which no brain disturbance exists,\r\nwe leave entirely the ground of modern psychology. As soon as we\r\nbelieve that the mind can be disturbed without a change in the functions\r\nof the brain, we give away all that which has brought scientific order\r\ninto the study of psychological existence. Every mental disturbance\r\ncorresponds to a disorder in the brain's functions. But there cannot be\r\na change in the functions of the brain without a change in its\r\nstructure. Thus we must claim that all those so-called functional\r\ndisturbances like neurasthenia and hysteria, fixed ideas and obsessions,\r\nphobias and dissociations of the personality, as well as the typical\r\ninsane states of the maniac or paranoiac have their basis in a\r\npathological change of the anatomical structure of the brain. This\r\npostulate cannot be influenced by the fact that the microscope has been\r\nunable to detect the character of most of these changes.\r\n\r\nOf course all this does not exclude its being perfectly justifiable to\r\nseparate those diseases for which a definite destruction of the brain\r\nparts can be detected, as in paralysis of the brain, from those where\r\nthat is impossible. We may also expect that those disturbances in the\r\nbrain which we cannot as yet make visible, may allow more easily an\r\norganic repair and thus a restoration to the normal functions. Just as a\r\ndisjointed arm may be brought to function quickly again, a broken arm\r\nslowly, an amputated arm never, each brain cell too may suffer lesions\r\nwhich are reparable in different degrees. But it is evident that it\r\nremains then an entirely empirical question whether the invisible damage\r\nallows repair or not. We have no right to say that where the\r\ndestruction cannot be seen under the microscope there is no organic\r\nchange and the disturbance is therefore only a psychical one and can be\r\nremoved by mental means. All changes are physical and experience has to\r\ndecide whether they are accessible to psychological influences or not.\r\nStates like epilepsy may not allow any recognition of definite brain\r\ndestruction and are yet on the whole inaccessible to mental influence,\r\nwhile many a brain disturbance with visible alterations, resulting\r\nperhaps from anæmia or hyperæmia, may be caused to disappear. If on the\r\nother hand we say that we can cure with psychotherapeutic means only the\r\nfunctional brain diseases and define as functional simply those diseases\r\nwhich can be cured by such means, we move, of course, in the most\r\nobvious circle and yet just that is the too frequent fate of the\r\ndiscussions in certain quarters.\r\n\r\nEvery psychical disturbance is organic inasmuch as it is based on a\r\nmolecular change which deranges the function. Some of these changes are\r\nbeyond restitution; some can be brought back to a well-working structure\r\nby strictly physical agencies like drugs or electricity; others can be\r\nrepaired by physiological stimuli which reach directly the higher brain\r\ncells through the sense organs and which we call psychical under one\r\naspect, but which certainly remain physiological influences from another\r\naspect. And these psychophysiological influences of the spoken words or\r\nsimilar agencies are thus indeed for therapeutic effect entirely\r\ncoördinated with the douche and the bath and the electric current and\r\nthe opiate. It is a stimulation of certain brain cells, an inhibition of\r\ncertain others: a subtle apparatus which must be handled with careful\r\ncalculation of its microscopical causes and effects. That these words\r\nfrom an entirely different point of view may mean a moral appeal and\r\nhave ethical value, point to moral and religious ideas and reënforce the\r\nspiritual personality, lies entirely outside of the psychotherapeutic\r\ncalculation. As long as the curing of the patient is the aim, the faith\r\nin God is not more valuable than the faith in the physician and the\r\nmoral appeal of no higher order than the influence through the galvanic\r\ncurrent. They come in question only as means to an end and they are\r\nvaluable only in so far as they reach the end. That they can be related\r\nto an entirely different series of purposes, to the system of our moral\r\nideas, ought not to withdraw the attention of the psychotherapist from\r\nhis only aim, to cure the patient. The highest moral appeal may be even\r\na most unfit method of treatment and the religious emotion may just as\r\nwell do harm as good from the point of view of the physician.\r\nPsychotherapy has suffered too much from the usual confusion of\r\nstandpoints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nSUGGESTION AND HYPNOTISM\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychotherapy has now become for us the effort to repair the disturbed\r\nequilibrium of human functions by influencing the mental life. It is\r\nacknowledged on all sides that the most powerful of these influences is\r\nthat of suggestion. This is an influence which is most easily\r\nmisunderstood and which has most often become the starting point for\r\nmisleading theories. Before we enter into the study of the practical\r\neffects of suggestion and the psychotherapeutic results, we must examine\r\nthis tool in the hand of the psychotherapist from a purely psychological\r\nviewpoint. The patient may perhaps sometimes profit from suggestion the\r\nmore, the less he understands about its nature, but the physician will\r\nalways secure the better results, the more clearly he apprehends the\r\nworking of this subtle tool. Of course, that does not mean that any\r\npsychology is able to explain the process of suggestion to a point where\r\nall difficulties are removed, but at least the mysteries can be removed\r\nand the effects can be linked with other well-known processes.\r\n\r\nLet us be clear from the start that suggestion is certainly nothing\r\nabnormal and exceptional, nothing which leads us away from our ordinary\r\nlife, nothing which brings us nearer to the great riddles of the\r\nuniverse. There is no human life into which suggestion does not enter in\r\na hundred forms. Family life and education, law and business, public\r\nlife and politics, art and religion are carried by suggestion. A\r\nsuggestion is, we might say at first, an idea which has a power in our\r\nmind to suppress the opposite idea. A suggestion is an idea which in\r\nitself is not different from other ideas, but the way in which it takes\r\npossession of the mind reduces the chances of any opposite ideas; it\r\ninhibits them. It is indeed the best result of any successful education,\r\nthat the teachings have taken hold of the mind of the young in such a\r\nway that all the opposite tendencies and impulses and wishes do not come\r\nto development. The well-educated person does not need to participate in\r\na struggle between good and bad motives, for that which has been\r\nimpressed upon his mind does not allow the other side to come up at all.\r\nOur life would be crowded with inner conflicts if education had not\r\nsecured for us from the start preponderance for the suggestions of our\r\neducators.\r\n\r\nThe love of family and friends, of our country and our party are in the\r\nsame way such suggestions. We may hear arguments for the other side,\r\narguments which easily convince the man of the other party, but they do\r\nnot appeal to us: they are emasculated before they enter our minds; they\r\nhave no chance to overcome the resistance because suggestions stand in\r\ntheir way. No argument will overwhelm the suggestion which religion has\r\nsettled in our inner life, and from this strongest suggestion which can\r\nstand against any temptation of life small psychological steps lead down\r\nto the little bits of suggestion with which our daily chance life is\r\nover-flooded. Every advertisement in the newspaper, every display in the\r\nshop-window, every warm intonation in the voice of our neighbor has its\r\nsuggestive power, that is, it brings its content in such a way to our\r\nminds that the desire to do the opposite is weakened. We do buy the\r\nobject that we do not need, and we do follow the advice which we ought\r\nto have reconsidered. And what would remain of art if it had not this\r\npower of suggestion by which it comes to us and wins the victory over\r\nevery opposing idea? We believe the painter and we believe the novelist,\r\nif their technique is good. We do not remember that the inventions of\r\ntheir genius are contrary to our life experience; we feel sympathy with\r\nthe hero and do not care in the least that he has no real life. The\r\nsuggestion of art has inhibited in us every contrary idea.\r\n\r\nSuch daily experience shows us that suggestive power may belong to\r\ndifferent men in different degree. There are lawyers whose arguments and\r\nwhose presentation open our mind, it seems, to any suggestion: while\r\nothers leave us indifferent; we understand their idea, we follow their\r\nthoughts, and yet we remain accessible to opposite influences. There are\r\nteachers whose authority gives to every word such an impressiveness and\r\ndignity that every opposite thought disappears, while others throw out\r\nwords which are forgotten. On the other hand, the readiness to accept\r\nsuggestions is evidently also quite different with different\r\nindividuals. From the most credulous to the stubborn, we have every\r\ndegree of suggestibility, the one impressed by the suggestive power of\r\nany idea which is brought to his mind, the other always inclined to\r\ndistrust and to look over to the opposite argument. Such a stubborn mind\r\nis indeed not only without inclination for suggestions, but it may\r\ndevelop even a negative suggestibility; whatever it receives awakens an\r\ninstinctive impulse towards the opposite. Moreover we are all in\r\ndifferent degrees suggestible at different times and under various\r\nconditions. Emotions reënforce our readiness to accept suggestions. Hope\r\nand fear, love and jealousy give to the impression and the idea a power\r\nto overwhelm the opposite idea, which otherwise might have influenced\r\nour deliberation. Fatigue and intoxicants increase suggestibility very\r\nstrongly. To look out on a wider perspective, we may add at once that an\r\nartificial increase of suggestibility is all which constitutes the state\r\nof hypnotism.\r\n\r\nAt first, however, we want to understand the ordinary process of\r\nsuggestion in that normal form in which it enters into every hour of our\r\nlife and into every relation of our social intercourse. But if we begin\r\nto examine the structure of the process, we can no longer be satisfied\r\nwith the vague reference to ideas and their opposites. What does it mean\r\nafter all if we speak of opposite ideas? Can we not entertain any ideas\r\npeacefully together in our consciousness? From a logical standpoint,\r\nideas may contradict each other, but that refers to their meaning. As\r\nmere bits of psychological experience, I may have any ideas together in\r\nmy consciousness. I can think summer and winter or day and night or\r\nright and left or black and white or love and hate in one embracing\r\nthought. As mere mental stuff, the one idea does not interfere with the\r\nother. On the other hand, this is evident: I cannot will to turn to the\r\nright and to turn to the left at the same time. There may be a wrangling\r\nbetween those two impulses, but as soon as my will stands for the one,\r\nthe other is really excluded. Any action which I am starting to do thus\r\ncrowds out the impulse to the opposed action.\r\n\r\nIn the sphere of psychological facts, we have here indeed the only\r\nrelation between two happenings which necessarily involves an\r\nopposition. We could never understand why one brain cell might not work\r\ntogether with any other brain cell, but we do understand that nature\r\nmust provide for an apparatus by which the impulse to one action makes\r\nthe impulse to the opposite action ineffective. There is no action which\r\nhas not its definite opposite. The carrying out of any impulse involves\r\nthe suppression of the contrary impulse, and the impulse not to do an\r\naction involves the suppression of the impulse to do it. When we spoke\r\nof the relations of mind and brain, we mentioned that such a corelation\r\nof mental centers indeed exists. Physiological experiments have\r\ndemonstrated that the activity of those centers which stimulate a\r\ncertain action reduce the excitability of those brain parts which awaken\r\nthe antagonistic action. As far as the world of actions is concerned,\r\nthe mechanism of the process of suggestion thus seems not inaccessible\r\nto a physiological understanding.\r\n\r\nVarious ideas of movements to be carried out are struggling for control\r\nin the cortex of the brain. That is the normal status which precedes any\r\ndecision. The channels of motor discharge are open for both\r\npossibilities; we may turn to the right or to the left. Then the play of\r\nassociations begins. A larger and larger circle of ideas surrounds the\r\nidea of the one and of the other goal. Those ideas awaken emotions. On\r\nthe one side may call our duty and on the other side our pleasure.\r\nLarger and larger parts of the central content of our consciousness, of\r\nour own personality, become involved; our principles and maxims, our\r\nmemories, our hopes and fears, enter into the battle until deeper strata\r\nof the idea of ourselves enter into a firm association with the one\r\nside, reënforcing, perhaps, the idea of the goal at the right. This\r\nopens wide the channels of discharge for the movement to the right and\r\ninhibits thereby the excitability of the center which leads to the\r\nopposite action. The channel of discharge to the movement towards the\r\nleft becomes closed, the idea of that movement fades away and becomes\r\ninhibited: we are moving towards the right. The outcome was the product\r\nof our total personality.\r\n\r\nBut this result would have been different, if from the start the\r\nchannels of discharge had not been equally open for both possible\r\nmovements, and if thus the relative resistance to the impulse had not\r\nbeen equal on both sides. If, for instance, we had gone from the given\r\npoint frequently to the left, as a result of the habit and training, the\r\nimpulse to the left would have found less nervous resistance. The\r\nchannels would have become widened by the repetition and the opposite\r\nchannels would have been somewhat closed by the lack of use. Or if\r\ninstead of such previous habit, we should see at the decisive moment\r\nothers turning to the left, the impression would have become the\r\nstarting point for a reaction of mere instinctive imitation. While we\r\nmight not have followed that imitative impulse at once, yet the channels\r\nwould have been widened, the discharge in the direction would have been\r\nprepared by it, the resistance would have been lowered and the chances\r\nfor the opposite movement would have been decreased. Those people who\r\nmoved to the left gave us by their action the same kind of an impulse\r\nwhich they would have furnished if they had begged us with words, or if\r\nthey had ordered us to follow them with authoritative firmness. In each\r\nof these cases, the influence would have amounted to a suggestion.\r\nWhether we watched the movements of other people or whether their words\r\nmade an impression on us, in either case the way became prepared for a\r\ncertain line of action and therefore the way for the opposite action\r\nbecame blocked. The final outcome was thus no longer an entirely free\r\nplay of motor ideas, but there was a little inequality in play. The one\r\nhad from the start a better chance, the other was from the start\r\nlaboring under difficulties. The suggestion of actions is thus nothing\r\nbut making use of the antagonistic character in the nervous paths which\r\nstart from the motor centers. That all such phrases as the opening and\r\nthe closing, the widening and blocking, of channels of discharge are\r\nonly metaphors hardly needs special emphasis. Instead of such\r\ncomparisons, we ought rather to think of chemical processes which offer\r\nvarious degrees of resistance to the propagation of the nervous\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nWe see from here the direction in which many psychotherapeutic efforts\r\nmust lie, efforts which are entirely within the limits of the daily\r\nnormal experience, and belong to the medical practice of every\r\nphysician, yes, to the helpful influence of every man in practical life.\r\nThe intemperate man may suffer from his inability to resist his desire\r\nfor whiskey. The idea of his visit to the saloon finds the channels of\r\ndischarge open. We argue with him, we tempt him by attractions which\r\nlead to other ways, we suggest to him that he spend those evening hours\r\nperhaps with friends or with books for which we awaken his interest; we\r\ndo it as impressively as we can, we appeal to his friendly feeling for\r\nus; and if again the hour comes in which the desire for the artificial\r\nstimulation sets in with a motor impulse towards the bottle, the\r\nchannels for discharge have now been blocked. The idea of the opposite\r\naction arises, it associates itself with the emotions which we stirred\r\nup in his mind, it associates itself with the respect for the adviser,\r\nand thus new clusters of thought reënforce that idea of action which we\r\nsuggested, and this opposite line of action now finds a minimum\r\nresistance because our appeal has opened beforehand the gate. The desire\r\nfor the book works itself out into action while the desire for the cup\r\nfinds increased resistance.\r\n\r\nJust this is the kind of suggestion with which we correct faulty action\r\neverywhere in our social circle; and yet small steps lead on from here\r\nto the case where perhaps the desire for alcohol has reached that\r\npathological intensity in which the equilibrium is entirely disturbed\r\nand cannot be repaired without suggestions of a much more powerful\r\ncharacter, given in a state of artificially increased suggestibility--in\r\nhypnotism. The principle of opening certain channels of discharge for\r\nthe purpose of closing the opposite channels remains in the extreme case\r\nthe same as in the more ordinary cases. The impulse to drink is a\r\npositive one, but the principle is not different where the impulse is\r\nnegative. A friend who comes from the quiet country may feel unable to\r\npass the busy square of the city. The fear of an accident holds back his\r\nsteps, he cannot give the impulse to walk through the crowded rush of\r\nvehicles. Now either by words of advice, by persuasion or by showing the\r\nway, we may apply our suggestion, we open the channels of discharge for\r\nthe necessary movements and thus decrease the excitability of those\r\ncenters in which nervous fear was playing. And again small steps lead\r\nfrom here to the case of the psychasthenic sufferer whose phobia does\r\nnot allow him to cross any square and where reënforced suggestion has to\r\nbreak open the ways for the walking movement when the square is reached.\r\n\r\nThus we are not far from a causal understanding of suggestive influences\r\nwherever actions are concerned, where movements are to be reënforced or\r\nto be suppressed and where antagonism of the motor paths is involved.\r\nBut that does not seem to lead us nearer to the much larger group of\r\nstates in which the whole suggestive process concerns apparently the\r\ninterplay of ideas alone, where not actions but impressions are\r\ncontrolled by suggestion, where not impulses but thoughts are\r\nstrengthened or inhibited. Here lies the real psychophysical problem\r\nwhich has been by far too much neglected in scientific psychology and\r\nhas almost been hidden and made to disappear in the wonderful accounts\r\nof the hypnotists. But all those mysterious stories as to the\r\nachievements of suggestion cannot help so long as we do not understand\r\nthe working of the process, and we shall have the better chance to\r\nunderstand it the more we keep away from the uncanny and mysterious\r\nresults which refer to the most complex conditions, and rather seek to\r\nanalyze the state in its simplest forms and compare it with other simple\r\nmental processes. The psychology of suggestion has suffered too much by\r\nthe fascination which its most complex forms exert on a trivial\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\nYet the problem of suggestion in the field of ideas stands after all not\r\nisolated. Instead of connecting it with the weird reports of mystic\r\ninfluence from man to man, let us rather link it with the simple\r\nexperience of attention. There is no pulse-beat of our life in which\r\nattention does not play its little rôle. But does not attention share\r\nwith suggestion the characteristic feature that some contents of\r\nconsciousness are reënforced and others are suppressed? This negative,\r\nthis suppressing character of attention is not a chance by-product, it\r\nis most essential. There is no attention without it. If I am studying, I\r\ndo not hear the conversation around me, and if I listen to the\r\nconversation, my studies in hand become inhibited. If I enjoy the play\r\non the stage and give to it my full attention, my memories of the day's\r\nwork are suppressed; if I think of the happenings of the day, I am not\r\nattentive to the play and hardly notice what is going on. The inhibited\r\nimpression may often disappear entirely. While I am reading I am not at\r\nall aware of the tactual and muscular sensations in my legs, and if I am\r\ncompletely absorbed by my book, I may not even notice that the bell\r\nrings. In short, we have here as the most characteristic relation, just\r\nas in suggestion, the fact that one mental state becomes vivid, and that\r\nothers are losing ground, become less vivid, are inhibited and perhaps\r\ndisappear entirely.\r\n\r\nOf course, to point to the similarity between suggestion and attention\r\nis not a real explanation. It may be answered that attention simply\r\noffers the same difficulties once more. How can we explain in the\r\nattention process the fact that one idea, the one attended to, becomes\r\nvivid and that others evaporate? The difficulty evidently cannot be\r\nremoved by simply saying that only one sensorial process can be\r\ndeveloped in the brain at one time. The popular descriptions of\r\nattention easily make it appear as if such were the solution of the\r\nproblem. If one sensorial brain part is intensely engaged, the remainder\r\nof the brain is condemned to a kind of inactivity. Yet such a dogma is\r\nhardly better than the old-fashioned one that the soul can have only one\r\nidea at a time. We know too well now that the psychophysical system is\r\nan extremely complex equilibrium of millions of elements. Thus every\r\nchange must be explained with reference to this complex manifold. Above\r\nall, the facts simply contradict such an over-simple explanation,\r\ninasmuch as it is not at all true that only one content of consciousness\r\ncan become vivid. Our attention does not focus upon one point at all but\r\nmay illuminate a large field and thus give vividness to various complex\r\ngroups. If I am thinking about a scientific problem, an abundance of\r\nreminiscences of previous reading and imaginative ideas of possible\r\nsolutions, associative thoughts and conclusions are with equal vividness\r\nbefore my mind and the forthcoming thought may be influenced by this\r\ntotal combination. I have no right whatever to say that the idea of a\r\ncertain solution excludes there in my mind the consideration of the\r\nbooks which I have read and of the discussions which I have heard.\r\nEmotions may be superadded. In short, a world of mental states may be\r\nheld together by one act of attention. And new and ever new thoughts\r\nare shooting in, and all still find place there in the field attended\r\nto, while on the other hand my slight headache is inhibited and an\r\nappointment is forgotten. At a gay banquet, my attention may be given to\r\nthe whole hall with all its color effects and its flowers, and to all\r\nthat the table offers and to the music from the orchestra and to the\r\njokes of my neighbors. It is not true that any one of those parts\r\nsuppresses the vividness of the others, they seem rather to maintain and\r\nto help one another; and yet in the next moment, my neighbor may bring\r\nme news which absorbs my mind entirely and leaves no room for the\r\nflowers and the music and the meal. How far can psychology do justice to\r\nthese characteristics of attention?\r\n\r\nThere seems to be but one way. The attended-to idea does not exclude\r\nevery other idea, but it does exclude the opposite idea, and opposite to\r\neach other is here again that pair of ideas which lead to opposite\r\nactions, to opposite psychophysical attitudes. We must remember here the\r\npsychomotor character of our brain processes which we so fully\r\ndiscussed. We recognized the fundamental truth that there is no\r\nsensorial state which is not at the same time the starting-point for\r\nmotor reaction. We recognized that the brain is by its whole\r\npsychological development a great switchboard which transfers incoming\r\ncurrents into outgoing ones and that its biological meaning lies in the\r\nfact that it is the center piece of an arc which leads from the sense\r\norgans to the muscles. We cannot conceive of those relations as complex\r\nenough; we know, of course, that millions of nerve fibers lead from the\r\nperiphery to the highest psychophysical apparatus in the cortex of the\r\nbrain and that millions of fibers bring about the interrelation between\r\nthese central stations, but we must never forget that millions of fibers\r\nalso represent the outgoing paths and that they too lead down to lower\r\ncentral motor instruments which are again in numberless corelations. Any\r\nimpression is thus a starting point for attitudes and reactions and it\r\nis an empty abstraction to consider it otherwise. An idea is never,\r\npsychophysically considered, the end of the process, it is always also a\r\nbeginning. No external action may follow, but the mental impulse to such\r\nis nevertheless starting in the highest center.\r\n\r\nIf we look at the landscape, every single spot of color, reaching a\r\nnerve fiber in our eye and finally a sensory cell in our brain, is there\r\nthe starting point for an impulse to make an eye movement in the\r\ndirection of the seen point. The eye may remain entirely quiet as the\r\nimpulse to move to the right and to the left, to move up and to move\r\ndown, may be equally strong, but those thousands of impulses work in the\r\nmotor paths and only their equilibrium results in the suppression of the\r\nouter movement. With such motor scheme, we begin to understand the\r\nselective process in attention. An impression may be accompanied by\r\nother stimuli and associations, by thoughts and ideas, and thousands of\r\nsensory excitements may thus arise in the cortex, but only those have a\r\nchance for full vividness of development which coöperate in the motor\r\naction already started. Those impressions which would lead to the\r\nopposite actions have no chance because their motor paths are blocked\r\nand their own full development is dependent upon their possibility of\r\nexpression. To close the path means to inhibit the idea which demands\r\nsuch action. We can attend to a hundred thoughts together, if they all\r\nlead to the same attitude and deed. We can look at the opera, can see\r\nevery singer and every singer's gown, can listen to every word, can have\r\nthe whole plot in mind, can hear the thousands of tones which come from\r\nthe orchestra; and yet combine all that in one act of attention, because\r\nit all belongs to the same setting of our reactive apparatus. Whatever\r\nthe one wants is wanted by the others. But if at the same time our\r\nneighbor speaks to us, we do not notice it; his words work as a stimulus\r\nwhich demands an entirely different motor setting as answer. Therefore\r\nthe words remain unvivid and unnoticed.\r\n\r\nTo attend means therefore to bring about a motor setting by which the\r\nobject of attention finds open channels for discharge in action. Which\r\nparticular action is needed in the state of attention cannot be\r\ndoubtful. Attention demands those motor responses and those inner steps\r\nby which the object of attention shows itself more fully and more\r\nclearly. When we give attention to the picture we want to see more\r\ndetails, when we give attention to the problem we want to recognize more\r\nof the factors involved, when we give attention to the banquet we want\r\nto grasp more of the pleasurable features. This aim of attention\r\ninvolves that, as part of such reactions, the sense organs become\r\nadjusted; we fixate the eyeball, we listen, and in consequence the\r\nobject itself becomes clearer, and through the easy passage into the\r\nmotor channels the whole impression becomes vivid. At the same time, all\r\nthose associations must be reënforced and become vivid too which lead to\r\nthe same action. On the other hand, the opening of the one passageway\r\ncloses the path to the opposite action and inhibits the impressions\r\nwhich would interfere with our interest. Every act of attention becomes,\r\ntherefore, a complex distribution in the reënforcement and inhibition of\r\nmental states.\r\n\r\nNow let us come back to suggestion. It shares, we said, with attention,\r\nthe power to reënforce and to inhibit. But if we examine what is\r\ninvolved in the suggestion of an idea, we find surely more than a mere\r\nturning of the attention towards one idea and turning the attention away\r\nfrom another idea. That which characterizes and constitutes suggestion\r\nis a belief in the idea, an acceptance of the idea as real and the\r\ndismissal of the opposite idea as unreal. Yes, we may say directly that\r\nit is meaningless to speak of suggesting an idea; we suggest either an\r\naction or, if no action is concerned, we suggest belief in an idea. If I\r\nsuggest to the fearful man at twilight that the willow-tree trunk by the\r\nwayside is a man with a gun, I do not turn his attention to an abstract\r\nidea of a robber nor do I simply awaken the visual impression of one,\r\nbut I make him believe that such an idea is there realized, that he\r\nreally sees the person. If I suggest to him that he hears distant bells\r\nringing or that he feels a slight headache, he may not be suggestible\r\nenough to accept it, but if he accepts it he is not simply attending to\r\nthe idea which I propose but he is convinced of its real existence. The\r\nsame holds true with the negative; if I suggest to him that the slight\r\nheadache of which he complained has disappeared or that the smell which\r\nhe noticed has stopped, I do not simply invite him to think of the\r\nabsence of such sensations. It becomes for him a suggestion only if he\r\nbecomes convinced that these disturbances have now become unreal. The\r\nsame holds true for all those suggestions of ideas which belong to our\r\npractical life, the suggestions which art imprints on our minds, or\r\nwhich politics and religion impart. As long as we are under the\r\nsuggestion of the novelist, we really believe in the existence of the\r\nheroine; we really believe in the validity of the political party\r\nprinciple; it is not an argument to which we simply give our attention,\r\nit becomes a suggestion only when the belief in its objective existence\r\ncontrols our minds. We may say in general that suggestions which are not\r\nsuggestions of actions are without exception suggestions of belief.\r\nActions and beliefs are the only possible material of any suggestion.\r\n\r\nYet what else is a belief than a preparation for action? I may think of\r\nan object without preparing myself for any particular line of behavior.\r\nHere in the room I may think of rain or sunshine on the street as a mere\r\nidea, but to know that it now really rains or shines means something\r\nentirely different. It means a completely new setting in my present\r\nattitude, a setting by which I am prepared to act along the one or the\r\nother line, to take an umbrella or to take a straw hat, when I am to\r\nleave the house. I may think of the door of this room as locked or\r\nunlocked without transcending the mere sphere of imagination, but to\r\nbelieve that it is the one or the other means a new setting in my motor\r\nadjustments. If it is locked I know that I cannot leave the room without\r\na key. Every belief means the preparation for a definite line of action\r\nand a new motor adjustment in the whole system of motor paths, an\r\nadjustment by which my actions in future will be switched off at once\r\ninto particular paths. And there is theoretically no difference whether\r\nmy belief refers to the proposition that the door is locked or that a\r\nGod exists in Heaven.\r\n\r\nBut if every belief is such a new motor setting, then we are evidently\r\nbrought back to the mechanism which was essential for every suggestion\r\nof action on the one side and for every process of attention on the\r\nother side, namely, the mechanism of antagonistic movements. To prepare\r\nourselves for one line of action means to close beforehand the channels\r\nof discharge for the opposite. The suggestible mind sees the man with a\r\ngun on the wayside because he is preparing himself in his expectation\r\nfor the appropriate action; he is ready for the fight or ready to run\r\naway, and every line of the tree trunk is apperceived with reference to\r\nthis motor setting. The smell, on the other hand, has disappeared under\r\nthe influence of the suggestion because a new motor adjustment has set\r\nin, in which he is prepared to act as if there were no smell.\r\n\r\nThe difference between suggestion and attention lies thus only in this:\r\nthe motor response in attention aims towards a fuller clearness of the\r\nidea, for instance, by fixating, listening, observing, searching; while\r\nthe motor response in suggestion aims towards the practical action in\r\nwhich the object of the idea is accepted as real. In attention, we\r\nchange the object in making it clearer; in suggestion, we change\r\nourselves in adapting ourselves to the new situation in which we\r\nbelieve. If you consider attention as a psychophysical process open to\r\nphysiological explanation, you have surely no reason to seek anything\r\nmysterious in the process of suggestion; and no new principle is\r\ninvolved, if we come from the effect of the smallest suggestive hint to\r\nthe complex and powerful suggestions which overwhelm the whole\r\npersonality.\r\n\r\nThe two great types of suggestion, the suggestion of actions and the\r\nsuggestion of ideas, have now come nearer together since we have seen\r\nthat the suggestion of ideas is really a suggestion of the practical\r\nacceptance of ideas, and that means, of a preparation towards a certain\r\nline of action. In the one case I suggest the idea of a certain action\r\nand this motor idea leads to the action itself, and in the other case I\r\nsuggest a certain preparatory setting for action and that will lead to\r\nthe appropriate action whenever the time for action comes. Every\r\nsuggestion is thus ultimately a suggestion of activity. The most\r\neffective suggestion for an action results, of course, if both methods\r\nare combined, that is, if we suggest not only the will to perform the\r\naction, but at the same time the belief that the end of the action will\r\nbe real. Suggestion reaches us usually from without. Yet there is again\r\nno new principle involved, when the new motor setting results from one's\r\nown associations and emotions. Then we speak of auto-suggestion. It is\r\nthe same difference which exists between the attention called forth\r\nthrough an outer impression and the attention directed by our own will.\r\nLoud noise demands our attention, and even a whispered word may awaken\r\nassociations which stir up the attention. In both cases the channels for\r\nadjustment become opened without our intention. But if we are expecting\r\nsomething of importance, if we start to watch a certain development and\r\nto find something which we seek, we open the channels by our own effort\r\nbeforehand and produce our own settings thus through a voluntary\r\nattention. In this way suggestion too may start from without,--by a\r\nspoken word, by a movement, by a hint; or may start within us and may\r\ngive us our caprices and our prejudices.\r\n\r\nWe must not neglect one other feature of the suggestion. Not every\r\nproposition to action or to belief can be called a suggestion. Essential\r\ntoo remains the other side of it, the overcoming of the resistance. A\r\nmere request, \"Please hand me the book on the table,\" or a mere\r\ncommunication, \"It rains,\" may produce and will produce the fit motor\r\nresponse, the movement towards handing over the book or opening of the\r\numbrella, and yet there may be no suggestive element involved. We have a\r\nright to speak of suggestion only if a resistance is to be broken down,\r\nthat is, if the antagonistic impulse, or the motor setting for the\r\nantagonistic action is relatively strong. If I say to the boy, \"Hand me\r\nthe book,\" when he was anxious to hide the book from my eyes and thus\r\nhad the wish not to hand it to me and the tone of my request overwhelmed\r\nhis own intention, then to be sure suggestion is at work. The stronger\r\nthe resistance, the greater the degree of suggestive power which is\r\nneeded to overcome the motor setting. If I say to the normal man, \"It\r\nrains,\" while he sees the blue sky and the dry street, his impression\r\nwill be stronger than my suggestion; but if he is suggestible and I tell\r\nhim that it will rain, he may accept it and take an umbrella on his\r\nwalk, even if no indication makes a change of weather probable. The\r\npresent impression of the dry street was strong enough to resist the\r\nsuggestion, the imaginative idea of that which is to be expected in the\r\nnext hour was too weak, and was overwhelmed by the suggestion of the\r\nweather prophecy.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the whole suggestive effect, being one of a new motor\r\nsetting, depends thus entirely on the equilibrium of the personality\r\nwhich receives the suggestion. Every element which reaches the mind\r\nthrough sense organs or through associations must have influence in\r\nhelping the one or the other side, that is, in opening the channels of\r\naction in the suggested direction or in the antagonistic one. The\r\nresults appear surprising only if we forget how endlessly complex this\r\npsychomotor apparatus really is. If we disregard this complexity we may\r\neasily have the feeling that one person has an unexplainable influence\r\nover another, as if the will of the one could control in a mysterious\r\nway the will of the other. But as soon as we see that every action is\r\nthe result of the coöperation of hundreds of thousands of psychomotor\r\nimpulses which are in definite relation to antagonistic energies, and\r\nthat the result depends upon the struggling and balancing of this most\r\ncomplex apparatus, then we understand more easily how outer influences\r\nmay help the one or the other side to preponderance: as soon as the\r\nbalance turns to the one side, a completely new adjustment must set in.\r\nAnd we understand especially that there is nowhere a sharp demarcation\r\nline between receiving communications and receiving suggestions. By\r\nsmall steps suggestion shades over into the ordinary exchange of ideas,\r\npropositions, and impressions, just as attention shades over into a\r\nneutral perception.\r\n\r\nTo be suggestible means thus to be provided with a psychophysical\r\napparatus in which new propositions for actions close easily the\r\nchannels for antagonistic activity. Such an apparatus carries with it\r\nthe disadvantage that the personality may too easily be guided contrary\r\nto his own knowledge and experience. He will be carried away by every\r\nnew proposition and will accept beliefs which his own thoughts ought to\r\nreject. On the other hand, it has the advantage that he will be open to\r\nnew ideas, be ready to follow good examples, never stubbornly close his\r\nmind to the unaccustomed and the uncomfortable. It is easy to determine\r\nthe degree of suggestibility. Take this case. I draw on the blackboard\r\nof a classroom two circles of an equal size, and write in the one the\r\nnumber fourteen and in the other the number eighty-nine, and ask the\r\nchildren which is the larger circle. The suggestible ones will believe\r\nthat the circle with the higher number in it is really larger than the\r\nother, the unsuggestible children will follow the advice of their senses\r\nand call both equal, and there may be a few children with negative\r\nsuggestibility who would call the circle with the higher number the\r\nsmaller circle. What happened to the suggestible ones was that the\r\nhigher number brought about a motor attitude which faced that whole\r\ncomplex as being more imposing and this new motor setting was with them\r\nstrong enough to overcome the motor adjustment which the circles alone\r\nproduced. Such experiments of the psychological laboratory can be varied\r\na thousandfold, and it might not be unwise to introduce them into many\r\npractical fields. Everybody knows for instance how much may depend upon\r\nthe suggestibility of the witness in court. The suggestible witness\r\nbelieves himself to have seen and heard what the lawyer suggests. The\r\nmemory picture which such a witness has in mind offers, of course, much\r\nless resistance to the opposite action and attitude and belief than the\r\nimmediate impression. If I show the witness a colored picture of a room\r\nand close the book and ask him whether there were three or four chairs\r\nin the picture and whether the curtain was green or red, the suggestible\r\nman will decide for one or the other proposition, even if there were\r\nonly two chairs and a blue curtain. The perception would have resisted\r\nthe suggestion, the fading memory image cannot resist it. Thus\r\nsuggestibility is really a practical factor in every walk of life. And\r\nit is in the highest interests of psychotherapy that this intimate\r\nconnection between suggestion and ordinary talk and intercourse, between\r\nsuggestion and ordinary choice of motives, between suggestion and\r\nattention be steadily kept in view and that suggestion is not\r\ntransformed into a kind of mysterious agency.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, the importance of suggestion for psychotherapy is not\r\nconfined to these suggestive processes of daily life. They play a rôle\r\nthere, as we shall see, and we shall claim that even the mere presence\r\nof the physician may have its suggestive power and so may every remedy\r\nwhich he applies. But no doubt many of his suggestive effects depend on\r\na power which far transcends the suggestions of our daily life. Yet the\r\npsychologist must insist again that no new principle is involved, that\r\neven in the strongest forms of suggestion, in hypnotism, nothing depends\r\nupon any special influence emanating from the mind of the hypnotizer or\r\nupon any special power flowing over from brain to brain; but that\r\neverything results from the change of equilibrium in the psychomotor\r\nprocesses of the hypnotized, and thus upon the interplay of his own\r\nmental functions. All that is needed is a higher degree of\r\nsuggestibility than is found in the normal life. In a more suggestible\r\nmind even the direct sense impressions may be overwhelmed by the\r\nproposition for an untrue belief and the strongest desires may yield to\r\nthe new propositions of action. This library may then become a garden\r\nwhere the hypnotized person picks flowers from the floor, and the wise\r\nman stands on one leg and repeats the alphabet, if the hypnotizer asks\r\nhim to do so. Let us consider at first this extreme case. By a few\r\nmanipulations I have brought a man into a deep hypnotic state. He is now\r\nunable to resist any suggestion, either suggestion of impulse or\r\nsuggestion of belief, and as every one of the hypnotic phenomena can be\r\nexplained in this way, we may claim that the hypnotic state is in its\r\nvery nature a state of reënforced suggestibility. Whether I say, \"You\r\nwill not move your arm,\" or whether I say, \"You cannot move your arm,\"\r\nawakening in the one case the impulse to the suppression of the\r\nmovement, in the other case the belief in the impossibility of the\r\nmovement, in either case the result is the same; the arm remains stiff\r\nand any effort of his to move it is inhibited. I may go to the extreme\r\nand tell him that our friend by my side has left the room; he will not\r\nsee him, he will not even hear a word which the friend speaks. If I take\r\na hat in my hand and put it on the friend's head, the hat appears to\r\nhang in the air. Every impression of sound or sight or touch which comes\r\nfrom the friend is entirely inhibited. The direct sense impression of\r\neye and ear is thus completely overwhelmed by the suggestion.\r\n\r\nWhat has happened? Are the manipulations which I applied sufficient to\r\nproduce the changes by their physical influence? Certainly not; they are\r\nof the most different kinds and yet all may have the same effect.\r\nPerhaps I may have used the easy method of making the subject stare at a\r\nshining button held in front of his forehead. Or I may have used slight\r\ntactual impressions, while he was lying with closed eyes, or I may have\r\nproduced the abnormal state by monotonous noises of falling waterdrops,\r\nor I may have simply spoken to him and asked him to think of sleep and\r\nto relax and to feel tired, while I held my hand on his forehead or\r\nwhile I held his hand in mine. Or I may have relied upon mild talking\r\nwithout touching him at all; and yet every time the result was reached\r\nin the same degree. There is thus certainly no special physical energy\r\nwhich like a magnetic force flows over. It cannot even be said that my\r\nwill is engaged. I have often hypnotized without even thinking of the\r\nsubject before me, going through adjusted manipulations while my\r\nthoughts were engaged in something else. I have even hypnotized over the\r\ntelephone; and a written note may be substituted with the same result. I\r\nwrite to the patient that two minutes after receiving this letter by\r\nmail, he will fall into hypnotic sleep. The effect sets in; and yet at\r\nthat time, I may not remember sending the note at all.\r\n\r\nIt is thus entirely evident that the hypnotic effect results only from\r\nthe mental conditions of the subject. Whatever may stimulate his mind\r\nto the right kind of reaction will produce the desired result. The\r\nincreased suggestibility thus sets in by his own imagination which may\r\nbe stirred up by slight visual or tactual or acoustic stimuli or by\r\nmonotonous words or by feelings of relaxation and especially by words\r\nwhich encourage sleep. But just because it is the play of his own\r\nimagination, the most essential factor certainly is the will and\r\nexpectation of the subject. No one can really be hypnotized against his\r\nown will. And to expect strong hypnotic effect from a certain hypnotist\r\nis often in itself sufficient to produce hypnotic sleep. Thus there is\r\nno special personal power necessary to produce hypnotism. Everybody can\r\nhypnotize. And almost with the same sweeping statement it may be said\r\neverybody can be hypnotized, provided that he is willing to enter into\r\nthis play of imagination. The young child or the insane person is\r\ntherefore unfit.\r\n\r\nOf course, not everybody can be hypnotized to the same degree. Just as\r\nthe normal suggestibility showed itself very different with different\r\npersons, the degree of artificial reënforcement varies still more.\r\nPractically everybody can be brought to that breakdown of the\r\nresistance in which he can no longer open the eyes against the order of\r\nthe hypnotist, but rather few can be brought to the point of seeing\r\nextended hallucinations, or accepting the disappearance of persons who\r\nare speaking, or of yielding to the impulse to a dangerous action. The\r\nhighest reported degree, in which even criminal actions are performed\r\nby honest men, exists in my opinion only in the imagination of\r\namateurs; it is certainly not difficult to produce sham crimes for\r\nperformance sake, with paper daggers and toy pistols, but that is no\r\nproof at all that the hypnotized person would commit a crime under\r\nconditions under which he has the conviction that he faces a real\r\ncriminal situation. But if we abstract from real crime, we certainly\r\nhave to acknowledge that actions can be performed which appear in\r\nstriking contrast with the habits and character of the normal\r\npersonality, upset his knowledge, and are based on beliefs which would\r\nbe immediately rejected under ordinary conditions. These higher degrees\r\nof hypnotic state are easily followed by complete loss of memory for all\r\nthat happened during the abnormal state.\r\n\r\nHow have we to interpret such a surprising alteration of mind? It lies\r\nnear to compare it with sleep. The brain seems powerless to produce its\r\nnormal ideas, the associations do not arise, the normal impulses have\r\ndisappeared and a general ineffectiveness has set in; in short, the\r\nbrain cells seem unable to function. Of course, the explanation of sleep\r\nitself may offer difficulties. Is it a chemical substance which poisons\r\nthe brain during the sleep, or are the brain cells contracted so that\r\nthe excitement cannot run over from the branches of one nerve cell into\r\nthose of another? Or are the blood-vessels contracted so that an anæmic\r\nstate makes their normal function impossible? But whatever the physical\r\ncondition of sleep may be, have we really a right to emphasize the\r\nsimilarity between sleep and hypnosis? After all that we have discussed,\r\nwe ought rather to recognize that the hypnotic state too comes much\r\nnearer to the process of attention than to the process of sleep. We saw\r\nthat in every act of attention the process of inhibition is essential.\r\nAll that is not in harmony with the attended idea is suppressed. Yet we\r\nshould hesitate to say that in attention parts of our brain are asleep.\r\n\r\nWe should feel reluctance to group such inhibition together with sleep\r\nbecause it would be a sleep which at any moment can pass from one part\r\nof the brain to others and which certainly leaves at every moment most\r\nof the cell groups unaffected. We saw that attention does not at all\r\nfocus on one narrow point, but that an abundance of impressions, of\r\nideas and associations, of thoughts and emotions can enter the field of\r\nattention, if they all lead to one and the same motor attitude, and that\r\nonly the one part is inhibited which involves the opposite action. Such\r\na jumping sleep which at every moment selects a special part would be,\r\nof course, just the contrary of that which characterizes the sleep state\r\nof the fatigued brain. But exactly these characteristics of attention\r\nbelong to hypnotism too. It is not true that the mind of the hypnotized\r\nis asleep and that perhaps only one or the other idea can be pushed into\r\nhis mind. On the contrary, his mind is open to an abundance of ideas,\r\njust as in the normal state. If I tell him that this is a landscape in\r\nSwitzerland, he sees at once the mountains and the lakes, and his mind\r\nprovides all the details of his reminiscences, and his imagination\r\nfurnishes plenty of additions. His whole mind is awake; the feelings and\r\nemotions and volitions, the memories and judgments and thoughts are\r\nrushing on, and only that is excluded which demands a contrary attitude.\r\nThis selective process stands decidedly in the center of the hypnotic\r\nexperience and makes it very doubtful whether we are psychophysically on\r\nthe right track, if we make much of the slight similarity between\r\nhypnosis and sleep.\r\n\r\nThis has nothing to do with the fact that hypnosis is best brought about\r\nby suggesting the idea of sleep, that is, the belief that sleep will\r\nset in. This belief is indeed effective in removing all the ideas\r\nwhich are awake in the mind which would interfere with the willingness\r\nto submit to the suggestions of the hypnotizer. But the fact that\r\nbelief in sleep and expectation of sleep bring with them the hypnotic\r\nstate is not a proof that the hypnotic state itself is sleep. Even\r\nthe mental experiences which can remain in sleep, the dreams, are\r\ncharacteristically different from the hypnotic experience. Thus the\r\ndreams show that unselective awakening of ideas which is to be expected\r\nfrom a general decrease of functioning. The hypnotic variation is\r\ncharacterized just by its selective narrowing of consciousness. For the\r\nsame reason, hypnotism is strikingly different from such diseases of the\r\nmind as dementia. Certainly in dementia too, many associations are cut\r\noff, but it is not a selective inhibition, it is a haphazard destruction\r\nresulting from the degeneration in the brain.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental principle of the hypnotic state lies in its selective\r\ncharacter. Inhibited and cut off are those states which are antagonistic\r\nto the beliefs in the suggested ideas, and as their antagonism consists\r\nin their connection with opposite actions, the whole is again a question\r\nof motor setting. No doubt, such new motor setting can precede the\r\nnormal sleep too; thus the sleeper may be insensitive to any surrounding\r\nnoises, but perhaps awake at the slightest call from a patient who is\r\nintrusted to his care. In that case, one special feature of hypnotism is\r\nsuperadded to sleep but the sleep itself is not hypnotic. Again sleep\r\nmay go over into a state which shares many characteristic features with\r\nhypnotism, that is, somnambulism, and it may be said with a certain\r\ntruth that hypnotism is artificial somnambulism. But somnambulism, while\r\narising in sleep, is not at all a feature of sleep.\r\n\r\nWhile sleep is characterized by a decrease of sensitiveness and of\r\nselective powers, the selective process of hypnotism rather reënforces\r\nsensitiveness and memory in every field which is covered by the\r\nsuggestive influence. Stimuli may become noticeable which the normal man\r\nis unable to perceive, and long-forgotten experiences which seem\r\ninaccessible to the search of the waking mind may reproduce themselves\r\nand may vividly enter consciousness. Again we have there symptoms which\r\nrather characterize the state of over-attention than the state of sleep.\r\nWe might add further that we know states with all the characteristics of\r\nhypnotism in which even the subjective idea of sleep is entirely\r\nabsent, for instance, all those which are usually called states of\r\nfascination. A certain shining light or a glimpse of an uncanny eye may\r\nstartle and upset the imagination of the subject and throw him into a\r\nstate of abnormally increased suggestibility. It is well known that\r\nwhole epidemics of such captivation have occurred and have resulted in\r\nhysterias of the masses in which the subjects become the slaves of their\r\nimpulse, perhaps to imitate what they see or hear, or to realize ideas\r\nin which they believe without logical warrant. They surely are not\r\nasleep, are not even partially asleep. Every center of their brains\r\nwould be ready to work, if the captivated attention were not forcing the\r\nmind in one direction and selectively suppressing every impulse to\r\nopposite actions. The developed hypnotism finally shades off into\r\ninnumerable states of hypnoid character in which the sleeplike symptoms\r\nare entirely in the background.\r\n\r\nThus the increased suggestibility of the hypnotic state will result not\r\nfrom a partial sleeplike decrease of functioning but the decrease of\r\nfunction is a motor inhibition which results from over-attention. In the\r\nordinary attention, our motor setting secures only an increase in\r\nclearness and vividness of the attended ideas, but in an abnormal\r\nover-attention the new motor setting produces a complete acceptance with\r\nall its consequences. Abnormal or heightened attention thus goes\r\ndirectly over into the belief and into the impulse without resistance.\r\nThere is no hypnotism which does not contain from the first stage this\r\ndefinite relation to certain objects of attention, usually to a\r\nparticular person. All the manipulations, passes, fixation, monotonous\r\nspeaking, and so on narrow the contents of consciousness but hold the\r\nidea of the hypnotizing person steadily in the center of attention. The\r\nawakened expectation of sleep, the associated feeling of tiredness all\r\nhelp to cut off attention from the remainder of the world, but as no\r\nreal sleep sets in, this cutting off from the remainder reënforces the\r\nfocusing of attention on the one central idea of the hypnotizing\r\npersonality. Every word and every movement of this personality become\r\ntherefore absorbed with that over-attention which leads at once from a\r\nmere perceiving and grasping to a complete sinking into the suggested\r\nidea with the suppression of all opposites, and thus to a blind\r\nacceptance and belief. We saw before that such belief is indeed nothing\r\nelse but a motor setting in which certain ways of action are prepared.\r\nWe are to think in accordance with the belief in the suggested idea and\r\nthe channels for discharge in the opposite direction are closed. Even\r\nthe ordinary life shows us everywhere that the step from attention to\r\nbelief is a short one. The effort to grasp the object clearly works as a\r\nsuggestion to accept that which we are seeking as really existing, and\r\nthat from which we are to abstract and which we are to rule out through\r\nour attention, we believe to be non-existent. The prestidigitator does\r\nhis tricks in order to sidetrack our attention, but he succeeds in\r\nmaking us believe that we see or do not see whatever he wishes.\r\n\r\nThat the motor setting alone determines those changes and that a real\r\nsleeplike inability of the centers does not set in, can also be\r\ndemonstrated by the results of later hypnotizations. I ask my hypnotized\r\nsubject not to perceive the friend in the room; he is indeed unable to\r\nsee him or to hear him. Yet his visual and acoustic centers are not\r\nimpaired, the defect is only selective, inasmuch as he sees me, the\r\nhypnotizer, and not the friend. But even this selection inhibits only\r\nthe attitude and not the sensorial excitement. If I hypnotize him again\r\nto-morrow and suggest to him now to remember all that the friend did and\r\nsaid during yesterday's meeting, he is able to report correctly the\r\nsense impressions which he got, which were inhibited only as long as\r\nthey contradicted the suggestion, but now rush to consciousness as soon\r\nas the suggestion is reversed. As a matter of course, he must therefore\r\nhave received impressions through eye and ear in his hypnotic sleep of\r\nyesterday from all that happened, only he was not aware of it because\r\nthe channels of the accepting attitude were blocked.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the over-attention has produced the acceptance of the belief,\r\nall further effects are automatic and necessary. If I tell the\r\nhypnotized person that he cannot speak and he absorbs this proposition,\r\nwith that completeness in which he accepts it as a fact, not speaking\r\nitself unavoidably results. The motor ideas with which the speech\r\nmovement has to start are cut off and the subject yields passively to\r\nthe fate that he cannot intonate his voice. Thus a special influence on\r\nthe will is in no way involved. If the idea is accepted, and that means,\r\nif the preparatory setting for the action has been completed, the ideas\r\nof opposite activity must remain ineffective; the suggested idea must\r\ndischarge itself in action without resistance. As a matter of course the\r\nnew line of action will then surround itself with its own associations\r\nand will thus give to the subject the impression that he is acting from\r\nhis own motives. As soon as the psychophysical principles are\r\nunderstood, there is indeed no difficulty in going from the simplest\r\nexperience to those spectacular ones where we may suggest to the\r\nprofoundly hypnotized person that he is a little child or that he is\r\nGeorge Washington. In the one case, he will speak and cry and play and\r\nwrite as in his present imagination a child would behave; in the other\r\ncase, he will pose in an attitude which he may have seen in a picture of\r\nWashington. There is nothing mysterious and his utterances are\r\ncompletely dependent upon his own ideas, which may be very different\r\nfrom the real wisdom of a Washington and the real unwisdom of a child. I\r\nmay suggest to him to be the Czar, by that he will not become able to\r\nspeak Russian. In the same way I may suggest changes of the\r\nsurroundings; he may take my room for the river upon which he paddles\r\nhis canoe, or for the orchard in which he picks apples from my\r\nbookshelves.\r\n\r\nFinally there is no new principle involved, if the action which is\r\nprepared by any belief has to set in after the awaking from hypnotic\r\nsleep, the so-called post-hypnotic suggestion. As a matter of course,\r\njust these have an eminent value for psychotherapy. I may suggest to-day\r\nthat the subject will overcome to-morrow his desire for the morphine\r\ninjection, or that he will feel to-night the restfulness which will\r\novercome his insomnia. But if the suggestion of an idea means belief,\r\nand if belief means a preparation for action, we have indeed no new\r\nfactor before us if the action for which we prepare the subject is from\r\nthe start related to a definite time. If we do not link it with the\r\nconsciousness of a special time or of a special occasion which will\r\noccur later, the suggestion soon fades away. That my library is an\r\norchard is forgotten perhaps within ten minutes, if I have not come back\r\nto it in the conversation. But if I say that after awaking as soon as I\r\nshall knock on my desk three times, you will be in the orchard again,\r\nthe psychophysical apparatus is prepared, a new setting has set in, the\r\nthree knocks will bring about the complete transformation. In short the\r\ndifficulties disappear as soon as we are consistent in interpreting all\r\nsuggestive influences as changes in the motor setting and as the result\r\nof the antagonistic character of all of our motor paths.\r\n\r\nWe say the difficulties disappear. Of course, that is meant in a\r\nrelative sense only. It means essentially that we are able to bring the\r\ncomplex state of hypnotism down to the similar state of attention and\r\nmotor adjustment, but of course we must not forget that we are far from\r\na satisfactory explanation of the process in attention itself. We know\r\nthat the opening of motor channels in one direction somewhat closes the\r\nchannels for discharge in the opposite direction, but what mechanism\r\ndoes that work is still very obscure. Whichever principle of\r\nhypothetical explanation we might prefer, it certainly leads to\r\ndifficulties in view of the extreme complexity of attention in states of\r\nsuggestion and hypnotism. We might think of a mechanism which through\r\nthe medium of the finest blood-vessels should produce a localized anæmia\r\nin those centers which lead to the antagonistic action. Or we might\r\nfancy that by extremely subtle machinery the resistance is increased in\r\nthose tissues which lie between the various neurons, or we might even\r\nthink of toxic and antitoxic processes in the cerebral regions; and any\r\nday may open entirely new ways of explanation. We may add that even if\r\nthe mechanism of attention were completely explained, we are also still\r\nfar from understanding the physiological changes which go on in the\r\nsphere of the blood-vessels or of the glands and the internal organs. We\r\nunderstand easily that the idea of the subject that he cannot move his\r\narm keeps the arm stiff; but that his idea to blush really dilates the\r\nblood-vessels of his cheek is much less open to our causal\r\nunderstanding; still less that in very exceptional cases perhaps a part\r\nof the skin becomes inflamed, if we make believe that we touch it with a\r\nglowing iron. And yet here too we see that we move in the same direction\r\nand that we have to explain these exceptional and bewildering results by\r\ncomparing them with the simpler and simpler forms, that the process of\r\nattention contains all the germs for the whole development.\r\n\r\nIn claiming that hypnotism depends upon the over-attention to the\r\nhypnotizing person, we admit that the increased suggestibility belongs\r\nentirely to suggestions which come from without. Only that which at\r\nleast takes its starting point from the words or the movements of the\r\nhypnotizer finds over-sensitive suggestibility. Ideas which arise merely\r\nfrom the associations of the subject himself have no especially\r\nfavorable chance for acceptance. But surely we also know states in which\r\nthe suggestibility for certain of one's own ideas is abnormally\r\nincreased. Great individual differences exist in that respect in normal\r\nlife. There are normal hypochondriacs who believe that they feel the\r\nsymptoms of widely different diseases under the influence of their own\r\nideas, and others who are torturing themselves with fears on account of\r\nunjustified beliefs. But the abnormal increase of suggestibility\r\nparallel to that of hypnotism for suggestions from without exists for\r\nsuggestions from within, mainly in nervous diseases, especially in\r\nneurasthenic, hysteric, and psychasthenic states. Within certain limits,\r\nwe might almost say that this increase of suggestibility for\r\nautosuggestion is the fundamental characteristic of these diseases, just\r\nas increase of suggestibility for heterosuggestions characterizes\r\nhypnotism.\r\n\r\nEspecially in earlier times, the theory was often proposed that hypnosis\r\nis an artificial hysteria. Such a view is untenable to-day; but that\r\nhysteria too shows abundant effects of increased suggestibility is\r\ncorrectly indicated by such a theory. The hysteric patient may by any\r\nchance pick up the idea that her right arm is paralyzed or is\r\nanaesthetic and the idea at once transforms itself into a belief and the\r\nbelief clings to her like an obsession and produces the effect that she\r\nis unable to move the arm or that she does not feel a pinprick on the\r\nskin. These autosuggestions may take a firmer hold of the mind than any\r\nsuggestions from without, but surely such openness to selfimplanted\r\nbeliefs must be acknowledged as symptomatic of disease, while hypnosis\r\nwith its impositions can be broken off at any moment and thus should no\r\nmore be classed among the diseases than are sleep and dreams. The\r\nhysteric or psychasthenic autosuggestion resists the mere will of\r\nbreaking it off. Here, therefore, is the classical ground for strong\r\nmental counterinfluences, that is, for psychotherapeutic treatment.\r\nExperience shows that the strongest chance for the development of such\r\nautosuggestive beliefs exists wherever an emotional disposition is\r\nfavorable to the arriving belief. But emotion too is after all\r\nfundamentally a motor reaction. The whole meaning of emotion in the\r\nbiological sense is that it focuses the actions of man into one channel,\r\ncutting off completely all the other impulses and incipient actions.\r\nEmotion is therefore for the expressions of man what attention is for\r\nthe impressions. An emotional disposition means thus in every case a\r\ncertain motor setting by which transition to certain actions is\r\nfacilitated. It is thus only natural that a belief can settle the more\r\neasily, the more it is favored by an emotional disposition, as the motor\r\nsetting for the one must prepare the other. Hypnosis and hysteria thus\r\nrepresent the highest degrees of suggestibility, the one artificial, the\r\nother pathological; the one for suggestions from without, the other for\r\nsuggestions from within. But between these two and the normal state\r\nthere lie numberless steps of transition. The normal variations\r\nthemselves may go to a limit where they overlap the abnormal artificial\r\nproduct, that is, the suggestibility of many normal persons may reach a\r\ndegree in which they accept beliefs hardly acceptable to other persons\r\nin mild hypnotic condition. Thus there is no sharp demarcation between\r\nsuggestions in a waking state and suggestions in a hypnoid state. And\r\nthe expectation of coming under powerful influence may produce a\r\nsufficient change in the motor setting to realize any wonders. Moreover\r\nprobably every physician who has a long experience in hypnotizing has\r\nfound that his confidence in the effectiveness of the deep hypnotic\r\nstates has been slowly diminished, while his belief in the surprising\r\nresults of slight hypnotization and of hypnoid states has steadily grown\r\nand has encouraged him in his psychotherapeutic efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTHE SUBCONSCIOUS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story of the subconscious mind can be told in three words: there is\r\nnone. But it may need many more words to make clear what that means, and\r\nto show where the misunderstanding of those who give to the subconscious\r\nalmost the chief rôle in the mental performance sets in. The psychology\r\nof suggestion, for instance, which we have now fully discussed without\r\neven mentioning the word subconscious, figures in most popular books in\r\nthe treatises of both physicians and ministers as a wonderful dominance\r\nof the subconscious mind. The subconscious mind alone receives the\r\nsuggestions and makes them effective, the subconscious mind controls the\r\nsuggestive processes in consciousness, and the subconscious mind comes\r\ninto the foreground and takes entire hold of the situation when the\r\nhypnotic state sets in.\r\n\r\nBut we are always assured that there is no need of turning to the\r\nmystery of suggestion and hypnotism to find that uncanny subpersonality\r\nin us. We try to remember a name, or we think of the solution of a\r\nproblem; what we are seeking does not come to consciousness and now we\r\nturn to other things; and suddenly the name flashes up in our mind or\r\nthe solution of the problem becomes clear to us. Who can doubt that the\r\nsubconscious mind has performed the act? While our attention was given\r\nover to other questions, the subconscious mind took up the search and\r\ntroubled itself with the problem and neatly performed what our conscious\r\nmind was unable to produce. Moreover in every situation we are\r\nperforming a thousand useful and well-adapted acts with our body without\r\nthinking of the end and aim. What else but the subconscious mind directs\r\nour steps, controls our movements, and adjusts our life to its\r\nsurroundings? And is not every memory picture, every reminiscence of\r\nearlier experiences a sufficient proof that the subconscious mind holds\r\nits own? The poem which we learned years ago did not remain somewhere\r\nlingering in our consciousness, and if we can repeat it today, it must\r\nbe because our subconscious mind has kept it carefully in its store and\r\nis ready to supply us when consciousness has need for it.\r\n\r\nSurely if we think how this, our subconscious mind, is able to hold all\r\nour memories and all our learning, and how it transacts all the work of\r\ncontrolling our useful actions and of bringing up the right ideas, we\r\nmay well acknowledge that compared with it our conscious life is rather\r\na small part. It is as with the iceberg in the ocean; we know that only\r\na small part is visible above the surface of the water and a ten times\r\nlarger mountain swims below the sea. It seems, therefore, only logical\r\nto attach this whole subconscious mental life to a special subconscious\r\npersonality. Then we come to the popular theory of the two minds in us,\r\nthe upper and the lower, of which we can hardly doubt that the lower one\r\nhas on the whole the larger part of the business to perform. And we\r\ncertainly have no right to give to the word lower mind the side-meaning\r\nthat the activity is of a lower order. The most brilliant thoughts of\r\nthe genius are not manufactured in his upper consciousness, they spring\r\nsuddenly into his mind, their whole creation belongs thus to the\r\nassiduous work of the subconscious neighbor. There the inventor and\r\ndiscoverer gets his guidance, there the poet gets his inspiration, there\r\nthe religious mind gets its beliefs. In short, the constitution of the\r\nmental state allows on the whole to the upper consciousness a rather\r\ndecorative part while the real work is left for the lower house.\r\n\r\nYet it must be acknowledged that the scholars somewhat disagree as to\r\nthe dignity of the lower mind. Considering the usually accepted fact\r\nthat in hypnotism the lower mind comes entirely over the surface, just\r\nthese hypnotic events can indeed suggest two different views of the\r\nsubconscious and this doubleness is reënforced if we still add the\r\nentertaining material which comes to light by the automatic writing of\r\nmediums in their trance. The hypnotized person is ready to perform any\r\nfoolishness, is not influenced by any considerations of tact and taste\r\nand wisdom and respect, and thus some of the chief believers in the\r\nsubconscious personality stick to the diagnosis that the lower mind in\r\nus which shows up in hypnotism is a rather brutal, stupid, lazy,\r\ncowardly, immoral creature which ordinarily rather deserves to be\r\nsubdued by our noble and wise upper personality. And the automatic\r\nwritings of the mediums indorse this disrespectful view, for it is\r\ndifficult to gather more idiotic slang than the emanations of these\r\nletters of the planchette. On the other hand, the hypnotized person\r\nshows an increase of sensitiveness and hyperæsthesia in which perhaps\r\noptical impressions or smells may be noticed which the ordinary man\r\ncannot perceive. Moreover the memory of the hypnotized is, as we saw,\r\nabnormally sharpened. Entirely forgotten experiences may awake again.\r\nThe same holds true for the hysteric in whom also, of course, the\r\nsubconscious takes hold of the inner life. Thus it seems entirely safe\r\nto say that the powers of the subconscious personality far surpass those\r\nof the upper conscious fellow, and that agrees with all those facts as\r\nto the subconscious origin of the work of the genius. Further, has it\r\nnot been found again and again that the hypnotized and the hysteric\r\ncannot only remember long-forgotten parts of the past but have\r\ntelepathic knowledge for distant events and even mysterious premonitions\r\nof the field of occurrences of the future?\r\n\r\nHypnotism is essentially the same as the old mesmerism, and mesmerism\r\nwas widely acknowledged as clairvoyance, and all that harmonizes again\r\nwith the experiences of the mediums whose subconscious mind in trance\r\nenters into contact with the spirits of the dead. The subconscious\r\npersonality is thus really a metaphysical power which transcends the\r\nlimitations of the earthly person altogether and has steady connection\r\nwith the endless world of spirit and the inner soul of the universe.\r\nMost popular books, it is true, do not demand from their readers the\r\nchoice between the one or the other type of the lower personality,\r\nbetween that brutal, vicious, ignorant creature and that far-seeing,\r\ninspired, powerful soul. They simply mix the two and adapt the special\r\nfaculties of this underground man to the special requirements of the\r\nparticular chapter, the subconscious being unusually wise or unusually\r\nstupid in accordance with the special facts which are just then to be\r\nexplained. Even that does not always settle all difficulties. They may\r\ndiscover, for instance, that the subconscious mind with which we deal in\r\nthe hypnotized person has again itself a subconsciousness. If we tell\r\nthe hypnotized person not to see a certain picture on the wall, this\r\nsubconscious personality perceives the whole room with the exception of\r\nthe picture. Yet after all someone sees this picture, because if we\r\nhypnotize him the next time and ask him what the picture contained, he\r\nnow knows its contents. Thus they must have been recognized in a\r\nsub-subconsciousness, and we therefore come to a personality which lives\r\non a floor still below the basement. But experiment can demonstrate that\r\neven this most hidden personality has still its secrets which are handed\r\ndownwards. In short, we finally have not merely two but a number of\r\npersonalities in us.\r\n\r\nBut now let us leave these fantasies of psychological fiction. Let us\r\nturn to the concrete facts, let us see them in the spirit of modern\r\nscientific psychology, let us try to explain them in harmony with the\r\nprinciples of psychological explanation, and let us discriminate the\r\nvarious groups of facts which have led to that easy-going hypothesis of\r\nthe subconscious. Discrimination indeed is needed, as it would be\r\nimpossible to bring the whole manifold of facts under one formula, but\r\nthere is certainly no unification reached by simply putting the same\r\nlabel on all the varieties and behaving as if they are all at once\r\nexplained when they are called the functions of the subconscious. Two\r\nlarge groups may be separated. Facts are referred to the subconscious\r\nmind which do not belong to the mind at all, neither to a conscious nor\r\nto a subconscious one, but which are simply processes in the physical\r\norganism; and secondly, facts are referred to the subconscious mind\r\nwhich go on in the conscious mind but which are abnormally connected.\r\nThus the subconscious mental facts are either not mental but\r\nphysiological, or mental but not subconscious.\r\n\r\nWhat does the scientific psychologist really mean by consciousness? We\r\nmust now think back to our discussion of the principles which control\r\nthe fundamental conceptions of modern psychology. We saw clearly that\r\nthe psychology which is a descriptive and explanatory science of mental\r\nphenomena can by no means have the ambition to be a full interpretation\r\nof the inner reality. Our inner life, we saw, is not a series of\r\nphenomena, is not a chain of objects which we are aware of and which we\r\ntherefore can describe, and which finally we can explain. But in its\r\nliving reality, we saw that it is purposive, has a meaning and aim, is\r\nwill and intention, and can thus be understood in its true character,\r\nnot by describing and explaining it but by interpreting it and\r\nappreciating it. This is the life attitude towards personalities when we\r\ndeal man to man. We do not at first consider ourselves or our fellows as\r\nmental objects to be explained but always as subjects to be understood\r\nin their meaning. If we pass from this primary attitude to the attitude\r\nof the scientific psychologist we gain, as we saw, an artificial\r\nperspective. We must consider then our inner experience of ourselves\r\nwith all our states as a series of objects made up of elements connected\r\nby law. Instead of the real things which in our real life are objects of\r\nwill and purpose, tools and means for us, the psychologist knows only\r\nobjects of awareness, objects which have no meaning, but which simply\r\nexist and which are no longer related to a will but are connected with\r\nother objects as causes and effects. Now we deal no longer with the\r\nchairs and tables before us but from a psychological point of view they\r\nbecome perceptive ideas of chairs and tables, ideas which are not in the\r\nroom but in our own minds. While these objects of our will and of our\r\npersonality become mere ideas, our will and personality themselves\r\nbecome, too, a series of phenomena. Our self is now no longer the\r\npurposive will but is that group of sensations and ideas which clusters\r\nabout the perception of our organism and its actions; in short, our\r\nself itself becomes an object of awareness.\r\n\r\nOur whole inner experience thus becomes a manifold of objects. Our self\r\nand the actions of our self are thus alike for the psychologist mere\r\nphenomena, mere objects which are perceived. Will and emotion, memory\r\nidea and thought--they all are now passing appearances like the sunshine\r\nand rain, the flowers and waves. By this transformation the immediate\r\nwill character of real life is given up, but instead of it a system of\r\nobjects is gained, that allows description and explanation. If we are to\r\ndeal at all with inner life not from a purposive but from a causal point\r\nof view, we are obliged to admit this reconstruction. Without it we\r\ncannot have any science of the mind, without it we can understand the\r\nintentions of our neighbor and appreciate the truth and morality of his\r\nmeanings but we cannot causally explain his experiences or determine\r\nwhich effects are to be expected. It is thus not an arbitrary\r\nsubstitution but a procedure just as necessary and logically obligatory\r\nas the work of the chemist who substitutes trillions of invisible atoms\r\nfor the glass of water which he drinks. The possibility of causal\r\nexplanation of the successive facts demands this remolding of the outer\r\nand of the inner world. We have discussed that before and now only have\r\nto draw the consequences.\r\n\r\nThus for the psychologist the mental world is a system of mental\r\nobjects. To be an object means of course to be object of some subject\r\nwhich is aware of it. What else could it mean to exist at all as object\r\nif not that it is given to some possible subject? But the world of\r\nobjects is twofold; we have not only the mental objects of the\r\npsychologist but also the physical objects of the naturalist. Science\r\nmust characterize the difference between those two and we pointed once\r\nbefore to the only fundamental difference. Physical objects are those\r\nwhich are possible objects of awareness for every subject; psychical\r\nobjects are those which are possible objects of awareness for one\r\nsubject only. The tree which I see is as physical tree object for every\r\nman, it is the same tree which you and I see; my psychical perception of\r\nthe tree is object for one subject only. My perception can never be your\r\nperception. Our perceptions may agree but each has his own. As to the\r\nphysical objects, we can entirely abstract from such reference to the\r\nsubjects. We say simply: the tree exists or is part of nature; and only\r\nthe philosopher is aware that we silently mean by it that it exists for\r\nevery subject and that it is therefore not necessary to refer to any\r\nparticular subject. But the perception of the tree which is either your\r\nidea or my idea evidently gets its existence only if it is referred and\r\nattached to a particular subject which is aware of it. Such subject of\r\nawareness is that which the psychologist calls consciousness and all the\r\nideas and volitions and emotions and sensations and images which make up\r\nthe mental life are then contents of the consciousness or objects of the\r\nconsciousness. To have psychical existence at all means thus to be\r\nobject of awareness for a consciousness. Something psychical which\r\nsimply exists but is not object of consciousness is therefore an inner\r\ncontradiction. Consciousness is the presupposition for the existence of\r\nthe psychical objects. Psychical objects which enjoy their existence\r\nbelow consciousness are thus as impossible as a wooden piece of iron.\r\n\r\nIf consciousness is nothing but the subject of awareness for the\r\nindividual objects, we see at once certain consequences which are too\r\noften forgotten in the popular, haphazard psychology. In the scientific\r\nsystem of psychology, consciousness has for instance nothing whatever to\r\nperform, that is, consciousness itself is in no way active. The active\r\npersonality of real life has been left behind and has itself been\r\ntransformed into that self which is merely content of consciousness. The\r\nperson who acts and performs the deeds of our life is then only a\r\ncentral content of our consciousness which is crystallized about the\r\nidea of our organism. It has thus become one of the contents of which\r\nconsciousness itself is passively aware. Consciousness is an inactive\r\nspectator for the procession of the contents. Thus consciousness itself\r\ncannot change anything in the content nor can it connect the contents.\r\nNo other function is left to consciousness but merely that of awareness.\r\nEvery change and every fusion and every process must be explained\r\nthrough the relations of the various contents to one another.\r\nConsciousness has, therefore, not the power to prefer the one idea or to\r\nreject the other, to reënforce the one sensation and to inhibit the\r\nother. From a psychological point of view, we have seen before that\r\neven attention does not mean an activity of consciousness but a change\r\nin the content of consciousness. Certain sensations become more\r\nimpressive, more clear, and more vivid, and others fade away, become\r\nindistinct and disappear, but all that goes on in the content of\r\nconsciousness and the spectator, consciousness itself, simply becomes\r\naware of those changes. Consciousness has also in itself no special\r\nspan, ideas appear or disappear not because consciousness expands or\r\nnarrows itself but because the causal conditions awaken or suppress the\r\nvarious contents.\r\n\r\nConsciousness has in itself no limit; all organization belongs to the\r\ncontent. Whatever psychical states are attributed to one organism belong\r\nthus to its consciousness but all the connections are entirely\r\nconnections of the content. We, therefore, have not even the right to\r\nsay that consciousness, as such, has unity. Unity too belongs to the\r\norganization of the content. One part of the content hangs together with\r\nthe other parts but consciousness is only the constant condition for\r\ntheir existence. Where there is no unity, there it cannot have any\r\nmeaning to speak of the double or triple existence. There may be a\r\ndisconnection in the various parts of the content and a dissociation by\r\nwhich the normal ties between the various contents may be broken but\r\nconsciousness itself cannot fall asunder. Thus consciousness cannot have\r\nany different degrees. The same consciousness experiences the distinct\r\nclear content and the vague fading confused content. Thus also\r\nconsciousness can never be aware of itself and the word\r\nself-consciousness is easily misleading. In psychology, it can never\r\nmean that the consciousness which is a subject of all experience is at\r\nthe same time object of any experience. Its whole meaning lies in its\r\nbeing the passive spectator. That of which consciousness becomes aware\r\nin self-consciousness is the idea of the personality, which is certainly\r\na content. The personality, the actor of our actions, is thus never\r\nanything but an object in psychology, and consciousness never anything\r\nbut a subject. Consciousness itself is thus in no way altered when the\r\nidea of the personality is changing. Only if all this is carelessly\r\nconfused, if consciousness is sometimes treated as meaning subject of\r\nconsciousness, and at another time as meaning the content of\r\nconsciousness, and again at another time the unified organization of the\r\ncontent, and at still another time the connection of the content with\r\nthe personality, and if finally all that is confused with the purposive\r\nreality of the immediate personal life--only then, do we find the way\r\nopen to those tempting theories of the subconscious personality.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf, instead, we stick to the scientific view, we find the following\r\nfacts. First, we have everywhere with us the fact that the earlier\r\nexperiences may again enter into consciousness as memory images or as\r\nimaginative ideas, that is, in the order in which they are experienced a\r\nlong time before or in a new order, either with a feeling of\r\nacquaintance or without it. Certainly at no time is the millionth part\r\nof what we may be able to reproduce present in our consciousness. Where\r\nare those words of the language, those faces of our friends, those\r\nlandscapes, and those thoughts; where have they lingered in the time of\r\ntheir seclusion? Scientific psychology has no right to propose any other\r\ntheory as explanation but that no mental states at all remain and that\r\nall which remained was the disposition of physiological centers. When I\r\ncoupled the impression of a man with the sound of his name, a certain\r\nexcitement of my visual centers occurred together with the excitement of\r\nmy acoustical centers; the connecting paths became paths of least\r\nresistance, and any subsequent excitement of the one cell group now\r\nflows over into the other. It is the duty of physiology to elaborate\r\nsuch a clumsy scheme and to make us understand in detail how those\r\nprocesses in the neurons can occur and it is not the duty of psychology\r\nto develop detailed physiological hypotheses. Psychology has to be\r\nsatisfied with the fact that all the requirements of the case can be\r\nfurnished by principle through physiological explanation. Least of all\r\nought we to be discouraged by the mere complexity of the process. If a\r\nsimple sound and a simple color sensation, or a simple taste and simple\r\nsmell sensation, can associate themselves through mere nervous\r\nconditions of the brain, then there is nothing changed by going over to\r\nmore and more complex contents of consciousness. We may substitute a\r\nwhole landscape for a color patch or the memory of a book for a word,\r\nbut we do not reach by that a point where the physiological principle of\r\nexplanation, once admitted, begins to lose its value. Complexity is\r\ncertainly in good harmony with the bewildering manifoldness of those\r\nthousands of millions of possible connections between the brain cells.\r\n\r\nEvery experience leaves the brain altered. The nerve fibers and the\r\ncells have gone into new stages of disposition for certain excitements.\r\nThis disposition may be slowly lost. In that case the earlier experience\r\ncannot be reproduced; we have forgotten it. But as long as the\r\ndisposition lasts--it is quite indifferent whether we conceive it more\r\nin terms of chemical changes or physical variations, as processes in the\r\nnerve cells or between the nerve cells--the physiological change alone\r\nis responsible for the awakening of the memory idea under favoring\r\nassociative conditions. Of course, someone might reply: can we not fancy\r\nthat there remains on the psychical side also a disposition? Each idea\r\nwhich we have experienced may have left a psychical trace which alone\r\nmay make it possible that the idea may come back to us again. But what\r\nis really meant and what is gained by such a hypothesis?\r\n\r\nFirst, do not let us forget that such a proposition could only have one\r\npossible end in view, namely, the explanation of the reappearance of\r\nmemories. But when we discussed the basis of physiological psychology,\r\nwe convinced ourselves that mental facts as such are not causally\r\nconnected anyhow. Our real inner life has its internal connections,\r\nconnections of will and purpose, but as soon as we have taken that great\r\npsychological step and look on inner life as merely psychological\r\nobjects, then the material is connected only through the underlying\r\nphysiological processes and we can never explain causally the appearance\r\nof an idea through the preceding existence of another idea. We may\r\nexpect one after the other, but we have no insight into the mechanism\r\nwhich makes the second follow after the first. Such insight into\r\nnecessary connection we find only on the physical side, and we saw that\r\njust here lies the starting point for the modern view of physiological\r\npsychology. If that holds true for the connections between idea and\r\nidea, of course it holds true in the same way for the connection between\r\nmental disposition and the corresponding memory. We can understand\r\ncausally that a chemical disposition in the nerve fibers brings about a\r\nchemical excitement in those neurons, but how a mental disposition is to\r\ncreate mental experience we could not understand; and to explain it\r\ncasually, we should need again a reference to the underlying\r\nphysiological processes. The hypothesis of mental dispositions would\r\nthus be an entirely superfluous addition by which we transcend the real\r\nexperience without gaining anything for the explanation.\r\n\r\nSecondly, if we really needed a mental disposition for each memory\r\npicture, in addition to the physiological disposition of the brain\r\ncells, can we overlook that exactly the same thing would then be\r\nnecessary for every perception also? The outer impression produces,\r\nperhaps through eye or ear or skin, an excitement of the brain cell and\r\nthis excitement is accompanied by a sensation; and no one fancies that\r\nthe appearance of this sensation is dependent upon a special disposition\r\nfor it on the mental side. No one fancies it, because it is evident that\r\nsuch a hypothesis again would be entirely useless. If every new\r\nperception needed such a special mental disposition, we should have to\r\npresuppose dispositions for everything which possibly can come into our\r\nsurroundings. Every smell, every word, every face which comes anew to us\r\nwould need its special ready-made disposition. In other words, our mind\r\nwould contain the disposition for every possible idea and that would\r\nmean that these dispositions would be in no way helps for explanation.\r\nIf the disposition exists for everything, no one particular thing can be\r\nexplained by the existence of that disposition. Again we should have to\r\nrely entirely upon the physiological brain excitement for explaining\r\nthat this word or that word is perceived by our mind. But if the brain\r\nexcitement alone is sufficient to explain the new perception in the\r\nmind, then no reason can be found why the renewed brain excitement would\r\nnot be sufficient to renew the mental experience. Thus there is nowhere\r\nroom for mental dispositions below the level of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThirdly, what could we really mean by such mental dispositions? A\r\nphysiological disposition for a physiological action is certainly not\r\nthe action itself. The finger movement in piano playing finds only a\r\ndisposition in my brain centers, in case I am trained; the movement\r\nitself does not last. But the disposition is at least itself a change\r\nin the physical world. The molecules are somehow differently placed, the\r\ndisposition has thus as much objective existence as the resulting\r\nmovement. Nothing at all similar can be imagined in the sphere of\r\npsychical contents. Such mental dispositions would have to exist\r\nentirely outside the world of concrete mental experiences and, if we\r\nscrutinize carefully, we soon discover that such theories are only\r\nlingering reminiscences of the purposive view of life, and do not fit at\r\nall into the causal one. If we take the purposive attitude, then every\r\nidea and every will contains indeed all that its meaning involves and\r\neverything which we can logically develop out of it is by intention\r\ncontained in it. All mathematical calculations are then contained in the\r\nthought of figures and forms, but they are contained there only by\r\nintention, they are logically inclosed; psychologically the\r\nconsciousness of the figures and forms does not contain any disposition\r\nfor the development of mathematical systems. We indeed have no right to\r\nthrow into a psychological subconsciousness all that which is not\r\npresent but involved by intention in the ideas and volitions of our\r\npurposive life.\r\n\r\nIf thus the memory idea is linked with the past experience entirely by\r\nthe lasting physiological change in the brain, we have no reason to\r\nalter the principle, when we meet the memory processes of the hypnotized\r\nperson or the hysteric. It is true their memory may bring to light\r\nearlier experiences which are entirely forgotten by the conscious\r\npersonality, but that ought to mean, of course, only that nerve paths\r\nhave become accessible in which the propagation of the excitement was\r\nblocked up before. That does not bring us nearer to the demand for a\r\nsubconscious mental memory. The threshold of excitability changes under\r\nmost various conditions. Cells which respond easily in certain states\r\nmay need the strongest stimulation in others. The brain cells which are\r\ntoo easily excited perhaps in maniacal exultation would respond too\r\nslowly in a melancholic depression. Hypnotism, too, by closing the\r\nopposite channels and opening wide the channels for the suggested\r\ndischarge, may stir up excitements for which the disposition may have\r\nlingered since the days of childhood and yet which would not have been\r\nexcited by the normal play of the neurons. Quite secondary remains the\r\nquestion of how these reproduced images finally appear in consciousness,\r\nthat is, whether they appear with reference to earlier happenings and\r\nare thus felt as remembrances, or whether they enter as independent\r\nimaginations, or whether they finally, under special conditions, take\r\nthe character of real, new perceptions. The latter case is well-known in\r\ncrystal-gazing, where long-forgotten memory ideas project themselves\r\ninto the visual field like hallucinations. But for the theory of the\r\nsubconscious, even these uncanny crystal visions do not mean more than\r\nthe simplest awakening of the experience of a landscape image of\r\nyesterday.\r\n\r\nWe turn to a second group of facts and again we have no fault to find\r\nwith the observation of the facts, even of the most surprising and\r\nexceptional ones. Our objection refers to the interpretation of them.\r\nThis second group contains the active results of such physiological\r\nnervous dispositions. In the first group, the dispositions come in\r\nquestion only as conditions for a new excitement which was accompanied\r\nby mental experience. In this second group, the dispositions are causes\r\nfor other physiological processes which either lead to actions or to\r\ninfluences on other mental processes. The dispositions are here working\r\nlike the setting of switches which turn the nervous process into special\r\ntracks. In the simple cases, of course no one doubts that a purely\r\nphysiological basis is involved. The decapitated frog rubs its skin\r\nwhere it is touched with a drop of muriatic acid in a way which is\r\nordinarily referred to the trained apparatus of his spinal cord, as no\r\nbrain is left, and the usefulness of the action and its adjustment is\r\nvery well understood as the result of the connecting paths in the\r\nnervous system.\r\n\r\nFrom such simple adjustment of reactions of the spinal cord, we come\r\nstep by step to the more complex activities of the subcortical brain\r\ncenters, and finally to those which are evidently only short-cuts of the\r\nhigher brain processes. That we react at every change of position with\r\nthe right movements to keep our bodily balance, that we walk without\r\nthinking of our steps, that we speak without giving conscious impulse\r\nfor the various speech movements, that we write without being aware of\r\nthe motor activity which we had to learn slowly, that we play the piano\r\nwithout thinking of the special impulses of the hands, that we select\r\nthe words of a hasty speech, if we have its aim in mind, without\r\nconsciously selecting the appropriate words--all that is by continuous\r\ntransitions connected with those simplest automatic reactions. And from\r\nhere again, we are led over gradually perhaps to the automatic writings\r\nof the hysteric who writes complex messages without having any idea of\r\ntheir content in consciousness. It is in such cases certainly a symptom\r\nof disease that the activity of these lower brain centers can go over\r\ninto the motor impulse of writing without producing secondary effects in\r\nthe highest conscious brain centers; it is hysterical. But that the\r\nmessage of the pencil can be brought about by such operation of lower\r\nbrain centers, or at least with imperfect coöperation of the higher\r\nbrain centers, is certainly entirely within the limits of the same\r\nphysiological explanation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, nothing is changed in the theoretic principles of the\r\ncase if the effect of these automatic processes in the nervous system is\r\nnot an external muscle action at first, but an influence on other brain\r\ncenters which may furnish the consciousness with new contents. We try to\r\nremember a name, that is, a large number of neuron processes are setting\r\nin which normally lead to the excitement of that particular process\r\nwhich furnishes us the memory image of the name. But those brain cells\r\nmay not respond, the channels may be blocked somehow or the excitability\r\nof those cells may be lowered. Now new excitements engage our\r\npsychophysical system. We are thinking of other problems. In the\r\nmeantime, by the new equilibrium in the brain the blockade in these\r\nfirst paths may slowly disappear or the threshold of excitability may be\r\nchanged. The physiological excitement may now be carried effectively\r\ninto those tracts. The cell response sets in and suddenly the name comes\r\nto our mind. This purely physiological operation in our brain paths must\r\nthus have exactly the same result which it would have had, if more parts\r\nof the process had been accompanied by conscious experience. And again\r\nfrom mere remembering a forgotten name, we come by slow steps to the\r\nsolution of a problem, to the invention, and finally to the creation of\r\nthe genius.\r\n\r\nSuperficiality of thought is easily inclined to object to such a\r\nphysiological interpretation and perhaps to denounce it pathetically as\r\na crude materialism which lowers the dignity of mental work. Nothing\r\nshows more clearly the confusion between a purposive and causal view of\r\nthe mind. In the purposive view of our real life, only our will and our\r\npersonality have a meaning and can be related to the ideas and higher\r\naims. Nature is there nothing but the dead material which is the tool of\r\nour will and which has to be mastered by the personality. In that world\r\nalone lie our duty and our morality. But as soon as we have gone over to\r\nthe causal aspect of our life and have taken the point of view of the\r\npsychologist, making our inner life a series of contents of\r\nconsciousness, of psychical phenomena, we have transformed our inner\r\nexperience in such a way that it has become itself nothing but nature.\r\n\r\nIt is mental nature, nature of psychical stuff, but each part of it is\r\nnothing but a mental element, a mental atom without any meaning and\r\nwithout any value; nothing but a link in the chain, nothing but a factor\r\nin the explanation of the whole, nothing to which any ethical or\r\næsthetic or logical or religious significance can any longer be\r\nattached. The psychical sensations and the physical atoms are equally\r\nmaterial for naturalistic explanation. To understand causally a certain\r\neffect, for instance the creation of a work of art, of a discovery or a\r\nthought or a deed as the product of psychical processes, is thus in no\r\nway more dignified or more valuable than to understand it as the product\r\nof physiological brain processes. The one is not more dignified than the\r\nother because both alike have nothing whatever to do with dignity. Both\r\nalike are the necessary results of the foregoing processes, and to\r\nattach a kind of sentimental preference to the explanation through\r\nconscious factors is nothing but a confused reminiscence again of the\r\nentirely different purposive view of life. And surely nothing is gained\r\nfor the higher values of life if this confusion sets in, because if the\r\npopular mind becomes unable to discriminate between the secondary,\r\ncausal, artificial aspect of science and the primary, purposive aspect\r\nof life, the opposite effect lies still nearer: the values of the real\r\nlife suffer and are crowded out by the knowledge of the scientific\r\nfacts. Man's moral freedom is then wrongly brought in question, as soon\r\nas it is learned that every action is the product of brain processes.\r\nLife and science alike will gain the more, the more clearly the\r\npurposive and the causal point of view are separated and the more it is\r\nunderstood that this causal aspect itself is demanded by certain\r\npurposes of life. The oratory of those who denounce the physiological\r\ntheories as lacking idealism in reality undermines true moral\r\nphilosophy. There is no idealism which can really flourish merely by\r\nignoring the progress of science and confusing the issues. The true\r\nvalues of the higher life cannot be safely protected by that thoughtless\r\nidealism which draws its life from vagueness and which therefore has to\r\nbe afraid of every new discovery in scientific psychology. Our real\r\nideals do not lie at all in the sphere in which the problem of causally\r\nexplaining the psychological phenomena arises.\r\n\r\nOur conscious experiences are thus indeed not only here and there, but\r\nusually the products of chains of processes which go on entirely on the\r\nphysiological side. We have no reason at all to seek for those preceding\r\nactions any mental accompaniment outside of consciousness, that means,\r\nany subconscious mental states. Then, of course, this physiological\r\nexplanation also covers entirely those after-effects of earlier\r\nexperiences, especially emotional experiences, which the physician\r\nnowadays likes to call subconscious \"complexes.\" We shall see what an\r\nimportant rôle belongs to these facts, especially in the treatment of\r\nhysteria and psychasthenia, but the interpretation again ought to avoid\r\nall playing with the conception of the subconscious. Emotional\r\nexperiences may produce there some strong stable dispositions in the\r\nbrain system which become mischievous in reënforcing or inhibiting\r\ncertain thoughts and actions without awakening directly conscious\r\nexperiences. The whole psychological switch system may have been brought\r\ninto disorder by such abnormal setting of certain parts, but the\r\nconnection of each resulting accident with the primary emotional\r\ndisturbances does not contradict the fact that all the causes lie\r\nentirely in disturbances of the central paths. It is a change in the\r\nneurons and their connections. To discover it we may have to go back to\r\nearly conscious experiences, but in the process itself there is no\r\nmental factor, and therefore no subconscious emotion is responsible for\r\nthe mischief carried out.\r\n\r\nBoth groups of facts which we have studied so far, have dealt with\r\nprocesses which were indeed not conscious but which we had no right to\r\ncall subconscious inasmuch as they contained no mental process at all\r\nbut only physiological dispositions and actions. We turn finally to the\r\nother smaller and more abnormal group of so-called subconscious facts in\r\nwhich the facts are mental indeed and not only physiological, but not at\r\nall outside of consciousness and thus again not subconscious. A\r\nconscious fact may easily suggest the appeal to subconscious theories to\r\nthose who have accepted such theories for other reasons. There are, for\r\ninstance, plenty of mental experiences which we do not notice or which\r\nwe do not recognize. Yet if we find later that they must have influenced\r\nour mind, we are easily inclined to refer them to subconscious activity.\r\nBut it is evident that to be content of consciousness means not at all\r\nnecessarily to be object of attention or object of recognition.\r\nAwareness does not involve interest. If I hear a musical sound, I may\r\nnot recognize at all the overtones which are contained in it. As soon as\r\nI take resonators and by them reënforce the loudness of those overtones,\r\nthey become vivid for me and I can now notice them well even when the\r\nresonators are removed. I surely was aware of them, that is, had them in\r\nconsciousness all the time but there were no contrast feelings and no\r\nassociations in consciousness which gave them sufficient clearness to\r\nattract attention.\r\n\r\nIn this way I may be again led by gradual stages to more and more\r\ncomplex experiences. I may overlook and yet include within my content of\r\nconsciousness most various parts of my surroundings; and yet the\r\nneglected is not less in consciousness itself than the attended. Much\r\nthat figures in literature as subconscious means indeed nothing else but\r\nthe unattended. But it belongs to the elements of psychological analysis\r\nto recognize that the full content of consciousness is always larger\r\nthan the narrow field of attention. This narrow field on the other hand\r\nhas certainly no sharp demarcation line. There is a steady shading off\r\nfrom the most vivid to the least vivid. We cannot grasp those least\r\nvivid contents of consciousness, we cannot fixate them as such, because\r\nas soon as we try to hold them, they move from the periphery of the\r\ncontent into its center and become themselves vivid and clear. But as we\r\nare surely aware of different degrees of clearness and vividness in our\r\ncentral mass of contents, we have no difficulty in acknowledging the\r\nexistence of still lower degrees of vividness in those elements which\r\nare blending and fusing into a general background of conscious\r\nexperiences. Nothing stands out there, nothing can be discriminated in\r\nits detail. That background is not even made up of whole ideas and whole\r\nmemories and whole emotions and feelings and judgments and volitions,\r\nbut of loose fragments; half ideas and quarter ideas, atoms of feelings\r\nand incipient impulses and bits of memory images are always mixed in\r\nthat half-dark background. And yet it is by principle not less in\r\nconsciousness, and consciousness itself is not different for these\r\ncontents. It is not half-clear consciousness, not a lower degree of\r\nawareness, only the objects of awareness are crumbled and fading.\r\n\r\nWhether these background objects really exist can only be made out by\r\nstudying carefully the changes which result under different conditions,\r\nthe influences which those loose parts have on the structure of the\r\nwhole, and the effect of their complete disappearance. I may never\r\nreally notice a little thing in my room and yet may be aware that it has\r\nbeen taken away. The visual image of it was an element of my mental\r\nbackground, when I was sitting at my desk, but it never before moved to\r\nthe center of my conscious content. But this center itself is also\r\nconstantly changing. Sometimes the one, sometimes the other idea may\r\nenter into it, but in this alternation that which is not in the focus\r\neither remains in consciousness unattended or when it disappears from it\r\nit loses its mental character altogether. If I attend a tiresome lecture\r\nwhile my mind is engaged with a practical problem of my own life, there\r\nmay be a steady rivalry between the words which come with the force of\r\nouter stimulus to my brain and make me listen and my inner difficulties\r\nwhich claim my attention. I listen for a while, and then suddenly,\r\nwithout noticing it, my own thoughts may have taken the center of the\r\nstage and again without sudden interruption a word may catch my\r\nattention. While I was thinking of my own problem the sounds of the\r\nlecturer were really outside of my field of attention, yet some remark\r\nnow pushes itself again into the center. That does not mean that a\r\nsubconscious mind is listening while my lucid mind was thinking, but it\r\ndoes mean that those words were unattended and remained in the periphery\r\nof the field of consciousness. But when some of the sentences stirred up\r\nin that peripheral field some important associations, they were strong\r\nenough to produce a new motor reaction by which the mental equilibrium\r\nbecame changed again and by which the lecturer overwhelmed my private\r\nthoughts. Yet even this state of mind, without any break, can go over\r\ninto an absolutely physiological process. I may for a while really\r\ninhibit the lecturer's voice completely and remain in the thoughts of my\r\nown imagination. After a minute or two, the resistance against the\r\nacoustical stimulus will certainly be broken and the sound will again\r\nenter into my consciousness, but in that interval there was no\r\nsubconscious and not even any unattended mental function; there was no\r\nmental process at all. The sound reached my brain but as the motor\r\nsetting was adverse, the sounds did not bring about that highest act of\r\nphysiological transmission which is accompanied by mental contents. Thus\r\nit became entirely physiological. Yet of course every word reached my\r\nbrain and left traces there. If I were hypnotized after the lecture and\r\nthus the threshold for the real awakening of brain excitements lowered,\r\nit might not be impossible that some of the thoughts of the lecturer\r\nwhich did not enter my consciousness at all, are now afterwards in the\r\nhypnotic state stirred up in me. Yet even that would not indicate that\r\nthey had become mental and thus subconscious at the time of the lecture.\r\n\r\nThe so-called subconscious, which in reality is fully in consciousness\r\nbut only unnoticed, easily shades over into that unconscious which is\r\nalso in consciousness but dissociated from the idea of the own\r\npersonality and thus somewhat split off from the interconnected mass of\r\nconscious contents. Wherever we meet such phenomena, we are in the field\r\nof the abnormal. The normal mental life is characterized by the\r\nconnectedness of the contents. Yet even that holds true, of course, only\r\nif we think of those mental states which exist at one and the same\r\ninstant in consciousness. As soon as we consider the succession of\r\nmental events, we cannot doubt that even normal experience shows breaks,\r\nlapses, and complete annihilation of that which a moment before was a\r\nreal content in our consciousness. We may have looked at our watch and\r\ncertainly had in glancing at the dial a conscious impression, but in the\r\nnext moment we no longer know how late it is. The impression did not\r\nconnect itself with our continuous personal experience, that is, with\r\nthat chief group of our conscious contents which we associate with the\r\nperception of our personality. Under abnormal conditions of the brain,\r\nlarger and larger parts of the completely conscious experience may thus\r\nbe cut off from the continuity of conscious life. But to be in\r\nconsciousness, and therefore to be not-subconscious, does not mean to be\r\nthrough memory ties connected with the idea of our own personality.\r\n\r\nThe somnanbulist, for instance, may get up at night time and write a\r\nletter, then go to bed again and not know anything of the event when he\r\nawakes in the morning. We have no reason to claim that he had no\r\nknowledge of the letter in his consciousness when he wrote it. It is\r\nexactly the same consciousness from a psychological standpoint as the\r\none with which he wakes up. Only that special content has in an abnormal\r\nway entirely disappeared, has not left a possibility of awakening a\r\nmemory image, and the action of the personality in writing has thus\r\nbecome separated and cut off from the connected experiences of the man.\r\nBut while the nocturnal episode may be entirely forgotten, it was not\r\nless in consciousness for the time being, than if a normal man should\r\nleave his bed hastily to write a letter. Moreover under abnormal\r\nconditions, as for instance in severe hysteric cases, those dissociated\r\ncontents may form large clusters of mental experiences in the midst of\r\nwhich a new idea of the own personality may develop. Considering that\r\nthrough such disconnection many channels of discharge are blocked, while\r\nothers are abnormally opened, it seems only natural that the idea of the\r\nown acting personality becomes greatly changed. Thus we have in such an\r\nepisode a new second personality which may be strikingly different in\r\nits behavior and in its power, in its memories and in its desires, from\r\nthe continuous normal one, and this secondary personality may now\r\ndevelop its own continuity and may arise under special conditions in\r\nattacks which are connected among one another by their own memory bonds.\r\n\r\nThe two personalities may even alternate from day to day and the normal\r\none may itself become pathologically altered. In that case the two\r\nalternating personalities would both be different from the original one.\r\nBut again we have even in such most complex and exceptional cases only\r\nan alternation in the contents, not an alternation in the consciousness\r\nitself. Different ideas of the own personality with different\r\nassociations and impulses follow each other in consciousness and the\r\nabnormality of the situation lies in the lack of memory connections and\r\nof mutual influences, but consciousness remains the same throughout. It\r\nremains the same, just as we do not change consciousness if we feel\r\nourselves in one hour as members of our family, in the next hour as\r\nprofessional workers in our office, again later as social personalities\r\nat a party or as citizens at a political meeting or as æsthetic\r\nsubjects at the theater. Each time we are to a high degree a different\r\npersonality, the idea of our self is each time determined by different\r\ngroups of associations, memories, emotions, and impulses. The\r\ndifferentiation is to be considered as normal only because broad memory\r\nbridges lead over from one to the other. The connection of the various\r\ncontents with the various ideas of the own personality constitutes thus\r\nin no way a break of consciousness itself and relegates no one content\r\ninto a subconscious sphere.\r\n\r\nFinally the same holds true, if the idea of the personality as content\r\nof consciousness in the patient is split into two simultaneous groups,\r\nof which each one is furnished with its own associations. Yet the\r\ninterpretation here becomes extremely difficult and arbitrary. Take the\r\ncase that a patient in severe hysteria at our request writes down the\r\nhistory of her life. We should not hesitate to say that she is doing it\r\nconsciously but now we begin to talk with her and slowly the\r\nconversation takes her attention while her pencil is continuing to write\r\ndown the connected story of her youth. Again the conversation by itself\r\ngives the impression of completely conscious behavior. As both functions\r\ngo on at the same time, the person who converses does not know what the\r\nperson who writes is writing, and the writer is uninfluenced by the\r\nconversation. Various interpretations are possible. Indeed we might\r\nthink that by such double setting in the pathological brain two\r\nindependent groups in the content of consciousness are formed, each one\r\nfully in consciousness and yet both without any mutual influence and\r\nthus without mutual knowledge. In the light of such interpretation, it\r\nhas been correctly proposed to speak of coconscious processes, rather\r\nthan subconscious. Or we may interpret it more in harmony with the\r\nordinary automatic writing or with other merely physiological reactions.\r\nThen we should suppose that as soon as the conversation sets in, the\r\nbrain centers which control the writing movement work through channels\r\nin which no mental factors are involved. One of the two characteristic\r\nreaction systems would then be merely physiological. We saw before that\r\nthe complexity of the process is no argument against the strictly\r\nphysiological character of the event. That various activities can\r\ncoexist in such a way that one of them may at any time slide down from\r\nthe conscious centers to the merely physical ones, we all know by daily\r\nexperience. We may go home through the streets of the busy town engaged\r\nwith our thoughts. For a while the idea of our way and of the sidewalk\r\nis in our consciousness, when suddenly we reach our house and notice\r\nthat for a long while we have no longer had any thought at all of the\r\nway. We were absorbed by our problems, and the motor activity of walking\r\ntowards our goal was going on entirely in the physiological sphere. But\r\nwhether we prefer the physiological account or insist on the coconscious\r\nphenomena, in either case is there any chance for the subconscious to\r\nslip in? That a content of consciousness is to a high degree dissociated\r\nor that the idea of the personality is split off is certainly a symptom\r\nof pathological disturbance, but it has nothing to do with the\r\nconstituting of two different kinds of consciousness or with breaking\r\nthe continuous sameness of consciousness itself. The most exceptional\r\nand most uncanny occurrences of the hospital teach after all the same\r\nwhich our daily experience ought to teach us: there is no\r\nsubconsciousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nTHE PRACTICAL WORK OF PSYCHOTHERAPY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE FIELD OF PSYCHOTHERAPY\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have discussed the psychological tools with which the psychotherapist\r\nhas to work but we have not spoken as yet of psychotherapy itself. All\r\nthat we have studied has been by way of preparation; and yet the right\r\npreparation is almost the most important factor for the right kind of\r\nwork. To rush into psychotherapy with hastily gathered conceptions of\r\nmental life may be sometimes successful for the moment, but must always\r\nbe ultimately dangerous. It is often most surprising what a haphazard\r\nkind of psychology is accepted as a basis for psychotherapy even by\r\nscientifically schooled physicians who would never believe that common\r\nsense would be sufficient to settle the problems of anatomy and\r\nphysiology; as soon as the mind is in question, no serious study seems\r\nneeded. Can we be surprised then that in the amateur medicine of the\r\ncountry within and without the church any fanciful idea of mental life\r\nmay flourish? If we are to recognize the rights and wrongs of\r\npsychotherapy in a scientific spirit, a sober analysis of the mental\r\nfacts involved was indeed at the very first most essential. Now we can\r\neasily draw the conclusions from our findings.\r\n\r\nWe recognized from the start the fundamental difference between two\r\ndifferent attitudes which we can take towards the inner life of any\r\npersonality, the purposive view and the causal. We recognized the sphere\r\nto which each belongs and we saw that all medical treatment demands the\r\ncausal view, thus dealing with inner life as part of the causal chain of\r\nevents. Each inner experience became therefore a series of so-called\r\ncontents of consciousness. These contents can be described and must be\r\nanalyzed into their elements. The basis of psychotherapy is therefore an\r\nanalytic psychology which conceives the inner experience as a\r\ncombination of psychical elements.\r\n\r\nBut the final aim was the causal connection. The appearance and\r\ndisappearance of those millions of elements and their connection had to\r\nbe explained. We recognized that such an explanation of the contents of\r\nconsciousness was possible only through the connections between the\r\naccompanying brain processes. Every psychical change had to be conceived\r\nas parallel to a physiological change. The psychology which is to be the\r\nbasis of psychotherapy had to be therefore a physiological psychology.\r\n\r\nWe recognized that these psychophysiological processes were processes of\r\ntransmission between impressions and expressions, that is, between\r\nincoming nervous currents and outgoing nervous currents, between stimuli\r\nand reactions. Thus we have no central process which is not influenced\r\nby the surroundings and which is not at the same time the starting point\r\nof an action. We have normal health of the personality as long as there\r\nis a complete equilibrium in the functions of the organism which adjusts\r\nthe activities to the surroundings. Every abnormality is a disturbance\r\nof this equilibrium. A psychology which is the basis of psychotherapy\r\nthus conceives every mental process in relation to both the ideas and\r\nthe actions; it avoids all one-sidedness by which the mind is cut off\r\neither from its resources or from its effects. The relations to the\r\nimpressions are usually the less neglected: and we must the more\r\nemphasize the fact that the psychology needed for psychotherapy knows no\r\nmental fact which does not start an action and that every change in the\r\nsystem of actions involves a change in the central experience. Wherever\r\nthis equilibrium of adjusted functions is disturbed, some therapy of the\r\nphysician has to set in: whether psychotherapy is in order depends upon\r\nthe special conditions.\r\n\r\nWe have recognized that there are no mental facts outside of those which\r\nare in consciousness and that from a psychological point of view\r\nconsciousness itself does not have different degrees and different\r\nlevels, that all varieties of experience refer thus only to the special\r\ncontent and its organization. There is thus no subconscious. On the\r\nother hand, we saw that there is no conscious experience which is not\r\nbased on a bodily brain process. By these two fundamental facts of\r\nscientific psychology, every possible psychotherapy gets from the start\r\nits clear middle way between two extreme views which are popular today.\r\nThe one school nowadays lives from the contrast between consciousness\r\nand subconsciousness and makes all psychotherapy work with and through\r\nand in the subconscious. The other school creates a complete antithesis\r\nbetween mind and body and makes psychotherapy a kind of triumph of the\r\nmind over the body. Practically every popular treatise on\r\npsychotherapeutic subjects in recent years belongs to the one or the\r\nother group; and yet both are fundamentally wrong. And while, of course,\r\nthis mistake is one of theoretical interpretation, it evidently has its\r\npractical consequences. The fantastic position allowed to a subconscious\r\nmind easily gives to the doctrine a religious or even a mystical turn\r\nand the artificial separation between the energies of the mind and those\r\nof the body leads easily to a moral sermon. Whether this amalgamation of\r\nmedicine with religion or with morality may not be finally dangerous to\r\ntrue morality and true religion is a question which will interest us\r\nmuch later. Here we only have to ask whether it is not harmful to the\r\ninterests of the patient and thus to the rights of medicine, and indeed\r\nthat must be evident here at the very threshold. Both schools must have\r\nthe tendency to extend psychotherapy at the expense of bodily therapy\r\nand to narrow down psychotherapy itself to a therapy by appeals which\r\nin the one case are suggestions to the subconscious and in the other\r\ncase persuasions and encouragements to the conscious will. As soon as we\r\nhave overcome the prejudices of those two rival schools and have\r\nrecognized that both are wrong, that there is no subconscious and that\r\nthere is no psychological fact which is not at the same time a\r\nphysiological one, we see at once that this common procedure of both\r\nschools is unjustified and dangerous. Mental therapy and physical\r\ntherapy ought to be most intimately connected parts of the same\r\ntherapeutic effort and mental therapy includes by far more than mere\r\nsuggestions and appeals. All that involves of course that its systematic\r\napplication belongs in the hands of the well-trained physician and of\r\nnobody else, but on the other hand, it involves that every physician\r\nought to be well schooled in psychology.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a disturbance to be cured is considered as a lack of\r\nequilibrium in psychophysical functions, every mental influence, every\r\nsuggestion and appeal becomes itself an excitement or an inhibition of\r\nnerve cells. The sharp demarcation line between a psychical agency and a\r\nphysical one disappears altogether; the spoken word is then considered\r\nas physical airwaves which stimulate certain brain centers and in the\r\ngiven paths this stimulation is carried to hundreds of thousands of\r\nneurons. The protracted warm bath or the cold douche influences, too,\r\nlarge brain parts by changing the blood circulation which controls the\r\nactivity of those neurons; or the bromides absorbed in the digestive\r\napparatus, or the morphine injected, also reach the neurons and again\r\nhave a different kind of influence on them, and the electric current may\r\nstimulate the nervous system in still a different way. It may be, and\r\nunder many conditions certainly is, essential to influence the brain\r\ncells just in that particular way which results from the spoken word,\r\nbut there too the causal influence remains a function of the physical\r\neffect and thus by principle there is no sharp separation from other\r\nphysical means. Thus to believe in psychotherapy ought never to mean\r\nthat we have a right to make light of the other means which, as\r\nexperience shows, may help towards the treatment of disturbances in the\r\ncentral equilibrium. Suggestions and bromides together may secure an\r\neffect which neither of them alone will bring about. It is most\r\nunfortunate that not without some guilt on the part of the physicians\r\nthemselves, the large public has begun to believe that orthodox\r\npsychotherapy has to mean a rejection of drugs and a contempt for the\r\ndoctors who prescribe them.\r\n\r\nOf course a discussion of psychotherapy cannot enter into the study of\r\nthese physical agencies of treatment, but at the threshold, we have to\r\ninsist that there exists no opposition between psychophysiological and\r\nphysiological means of influencing the brain. It may be true that drugs\r\nand baths and electricity have no influence on the subconscious, but the\r\ntrouble is not that the drugs are inefficient but that they cannot\r\ninfluence what does not exist. In the same way disappears now that new\r\nboundary line for psychotherapy which wants to limit it to mere\r\nsuggestion and appeal. If psychotherapy employs all the means by which\r\nwe can influence mental states in the interest of the health of the\r\npersonality, we have no reason to confine it either to a persuasion of\r\nthe subconscious through suggestion and hypnotism or a persuasion of the\r\nconscious, in which it works as a moral appeal. Suggestion and hypnotism\r\ncertainly must play a large part in psychotherapy and that part does not\r\nbecome smaller by the fact that we reject the subconscious\r\ninterpretation of them and consider them entirely as psychophysical\r\nprocesses. And in the same way undoubtedly we have to acknowledge the\r\npsychophysiological effect of persuasion and of the appeals to the\r\nconscious intellect and will. But for us as psychotherapists all those\r\nfactors have no moral value but only a therapeutic one, and thus stand\r\nin line with any other influence that may help, even though from a\r\npurposive point of view it stands on a much lower level. A mere mental\r\ndistraction by enjoyment and play and sport, an æsthetic influence\r\nthrough art, a mere stimulus to automatic imitation, an enforced mental\r\nrest, an involuntary discharge of suppressed ideas, and many similar\r\nschemes and even tricks of the mental physician belong with the same\r\nright to psychotherapy.\r\n\r\nIt is really doubtful whether the moral and religious appeals are always\r\nhelpful and not sometimes or often even dangerous for the health of the\r\nindividual; and it is not doubtful that morally and religiously\r\nindifferent mental influences are often of the highest curative value.\r\nThe more we abstract from everything which suggests either the mysticism\r\nof the subconscious or the moral issues of a mind which is independent\r\nof the body, the more we shall be able to answer the question as to the\r\nmeans by which health can be restored. This question is neither a moral\r\nnor a philosophical one but strictly one of experience. In this\r\nconnection, we must remember that we also have had to give up the\r\nartificial demarcation line between organic and functional diseases. We\r\nrecognized that every so-called functional disease has its organic basis\r\ntoo, and that it is entirely secondary whether we are able to find\r\nvisible traces of the organic disturbance. We had to acknowledge, to be\r\nsure, the difference between reparable and irreparable disturbances, but\r\nsuch grouping expresses only in another form the fact that experience\r\nalone can show whether the methods of treatment which we know so far\r\nwill be successful or not. Not a few disturbances of the equilibrium\r\nwhich appeared irreparable to an earlier time yield to the treatment of\r\nto-day, and no one can determine whether much which appears irreparable\r\ntoday may not be accessible either to psychotherapeutic or to physical\r\ntherapeutic means to-morrow. If we were carelessly to identify the\r\nreparable troubles with those which we cannot recognize visibly, we\r\nshould be at a loss to understand why, for instance, many forms of\r\ninsanity are entirely beyond our psychotherapeutic influences. On the\r\nother hand, every physician who uses psychotherapeutic means is\r\nsurprised to see the effective bodily readjustment where serious\r\ndisturbances perhaps of the circulatory system or the digestive system\r\nexisted. What the methods can do and what they cannot do must simply be\r\nleft to experience, but of course to an experience which is eager to\r\nexpand itself by ever new experimental curative efforts.\r\n\r\nFrom this point of view we can see clearly the general division of the\r\nwhole field of possible psychotherapy. Psychotherapy influences\r\npsychophysical states in the interest of health. There are only two\r\npossibilities open: either the disturbance is in the psychophysical\r\nsystem itself or it is outside of it, that is in the other parts of the\r\nbody which are somehow under the influence of the mind. In the first\r\ncase when the disturbance occurs in the mind-brain system itself, we\r\nought to separate two large groups, first those cases in which the\r\nsystem itself is normal and the disturbance comes from without, and\r\nsecond those in which the constitution of the system itself was abnormal\r\nand led to disturbances under conditions in which a normal system would\r\nnot have suffered. We have to consider both groups somewhat more in\r\ndetail, as each again allows a large variety of cases.\r\n\r\nThus we have before us, first the normal mind-brain system into which a\r\ndisturbance breaks, injuring more or less severely and for a longer or\r\nshorter time the equilibrium of the psychophysical functions. Here\r\nbelong any bodily processes which produce pain or any bodily defects\r\nwhich produce blanks in the content of consciousness; the pain of\r\nsciatica or of rheumatism, or the defect of the blind or of the deaf,\r\ncertainly interferes in a disturbing way with the perfect harmony of\r\npsychophysical activities. But here also belongs the suffering which\r\nresults from conditions in the surroundings, the loss of a friend, a\r\ndisappointment in life, any source of worry and grief. Social and bodily\r\nconditions alike may thus work to break up the equilibrium. The pain\r\nsensation interferes with the normal flow of mental life and the grief\r\nmay undermine the mental interests. The psychotherapeutic effort may be\r\ndirected toward removing the source of the disturbance, bringing the\r\npatient under other conditions, curing the diseased organ, and where\r\nthat is not possible, may work directly on the psychophysical state,\r\ninhibiting the pain, suppressing the emotion, substituting pleasant\r\nideas, distracting the whole mind, filling it with agreeable feelings,\r\nuntil the normal equilibrium is restored.\r\n\r\nThe psychophysical system itself was not really harmed by such\r\ninfluences. In the following groups, such is no longer the case. We here\r\nthink at first of those severe injuries which have their sources in\r\nabnormal processes outside of the brain. The anæmia of the patient or\r\nthe low state of his nutrition or the fever heat of his blood impairs\r\nthe harmony of the mental functions. Another and for the psychotherapist\r\nmuch more important group is that in which the impairment results from\r\ntoxic influences. Alcohol, morphine, cocaine, tobacco, and many other\r\ndrugs may have been misused and may have produced a most marked\r\nalteration in the mind-brain system. Desires may have developed which\r\ncompletely destroy the balance of the normal functions and yet the\r\nsatisfaction of which increases the poisoning effect. But here belongs\r\nfurther the effect of poisons which the body itself produces: the toxic\r\ndisturbance of uræmia or the coma in diabetes, or especially the grave\r\ndisturbances resulting from the abnormal action of the thyroid gland,\r\nthe source of cretinism. Many indications suggest that a near future\r\nwill consider this group much larger than we are really justified in\r\ndoing today, probably soon connecting a number of other mental diseases\r\nlike dementia præcox with toxic effects of bodily origin. Experience\r\nshows that in this group not a few chances exist for successful\r\npsychotherapeutic influence. Yet the means may be various in character\r\nand their effect may be a direct or an indirect one. A psychical shock\r\nmay remove directly the mental disturbance of the alcoholic state, but\r\nit is more important that mental suggestion can remove the alcoholic\r\ndisturbance indirectly by suppressing the desire for alcoholic excesses.\r\nEven where cure by psychotherapeutic means is out of the question, as is\r\nthe case with feverish delirium or uræmic excitements, no skilled\r\nphysician ignores the aid which a well-adjusted mental influence can\r\noffer to the patient.\r\n\r\nWe come to a third group. Some outside cause has harmed the central\r\nnervous system directly, and has left it in a disabled state after the\r\ncause itself has disappeared. Such causes may have been at first purely\r\nfunctional: for instance, a neglect of training, or a wrong training, or\r\nan over-activity, but the ill-adjusted function which involved, of\r\ncourse, every time an ill-adjusted organic activity or lack of activity,\r\nhas led to a lasting or at least relatively lasting disturbance in the\r\nsystem of paths. The neglect of training, for instance, in periods of\r\ndevelopment may have resulted in the retardation which yields the\r\nsymptoms of a feeble-minded brain, or the wrong training may have\r\ncreated vicious habits, firmly established in the mind-brain system and\r\ngravely disturbing the equilibrium. Above all, the overstrain of\r\nfunction, especially of emotional functions, may lead to that exhaustion\r\nwhich produces the state of neurasthenia. It is true that not a few\r\nwould doubt whether we have the right to class neurasthenia here where\r\nwe speak of the harm done to the normal brain. Many neurologists are\r\ninclined to hold that neurasthenia demands a special predisposition and\r\nis therefore dependent upon a neurotic constitution of the brain itself.\r\nBut if defenders of such a view, as for instance, Dubois, acknowledge\r\nthat \"we might say that everybody is more or less neurasthenic,\" we can\r\nno longer speak of any special predisposition. Certainly there exists a\r\nconstitutional neurasthenia sometimes but we have hardly a right to deny\r\nthat overstrain in the brain activity may produce a series of\r\nneurasthenic symptoms in any brain, and the special predisposition is\r\nresponsible rather for the particular selection among the innumerable\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\nNeurasthenia certainly is the classical ground for the psychotherapist.\r\nThe patient's insomnia and his headache, his feeling of tiredness and\r\nhis disgust with himself, his capricious manias and his absurd phobias,\r\nhis obsessions and his fixed ideas all may yield to the \"appeal to the\r\nsubconscious,\" and as a neurasthenic easily believes in the existence of\r\nvarious organic diseases in his body, Christian Science can perform here\r\neven \"miracles.\" In the case of retardation, the psychical influence\r\nwill have to be in the first place one of training. Yet it would be\r\nnarrow to overlook that in neurasthenia, too, suggestion has to be only\r\na part of the psychical treatment. Training and rest, distraction and\r\nsympathy and many other factors have to enter into the plan.\r\nIncomparably small, on the other hand, is the aid which psychotherapy\r\ncan offer in cases of real destructions in the brain, as in the case of\r\ntumors, hemorrhage, paresis or the degeneration by senility. More\r\neffective may be its work in concussion of the brain and especially with\r\ntraumatic neuroses, as in the case when a railroad accident has put the\r\nmind-brain system out of gear.\r\n\r\nSo far we presupposed that the central system itself was normal. No\r\nsharp separation line, however, lies between all these disturbances and\r\nthe equally large group of psychophysical disabilities resulting from a\r\ndefective constitution of the brain. The normal brain shades over by\r\nsmallest differences into the abnormal one; yes, even the varieties of\r\ntemperament and character and intellectual capacity and industry and\r\nenergy represent, in the midst of our social surroundings, large\r\ndeviations from the standard. That which might still pass as normal\r\nunder certain conditions of life would be unadjusted and thus abnormal\r\nunder other conditions. In the same way, we certainly cannot point out\r\nwhere the natural constitution of a brain ceases to be fit for its\r\norganic purposes and where the structural variations are ill-prepared\r\nfor the struggle for existence. Just as we claimed that an entirely\r\nnormal brain might be brought by an emotional overstrain to a state of\r\nexhaustion and disability, we may claim on the other side that a brain\r\nwhich nature has poorly provided may yet be protected against damage and\r\ninjury. The inborn factor does not alone decide the fate. Psychophysical\r\nprophylaxis may secure steadiness of equilibrium to a system which\r\ninherited little resistance. Yet this large borderland region, where an\r\nill-adjusted brain may be saved or lost in accordance with favorable or\r\nunfavorable circumstances, shades off again to the darker regions where\r\nthe inner evolution leads by necessity to disaster even under favorable\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nWe might begin this large group of the constitutional disturbances with\r\nthat neurasthenia which develops on the basis of inherited disability.\r\nLack of energy resulting from a feeling of tiredness, a quick\r\nexhaustion, a mood of depression, an easy irritation, even despair and\r\nself-accusation, sullenness and fits of anger, cranky inclinations and\r\nuseless brooding over problems, headache and insomnia characterize the\r\npicture which everyone finds more or less developed in some of his\r\nacquaintances. If we classify symptoms, we may separate from it that\r\nwhich we nowadays are inclined to call psychasthenia. An abnormal\r\nsuggestibility for autosuggestions stands in the foreground. Fixed ideas\r\nand fixed emotions, especially fears, trouble the patient. He may pick\r\nup his obsession by any chance experience and no good-will liberates him\r\nfrom the intrusion perhaps for years. The patient is perfectly well\r\naware that his ideas and his emotions are unjustified, he himself does\r\nnot believe in them, and yet they come with the strength of an outer\r\nperception and with the vividness of a real attitude, and his whole\r\nmental equilibrium may be upset by the continuous fight against these\r\ninvoluntary interferences. In the light cases, sometimes the one and\r\nsometimes the other autosuggestion may hold the stage; in the severe\r\ncases, mental life turns more and more around certain definite fears and\r\nyet it may all still be in the limits where the daily work can go on and\r\nthe world may not know of the hidden tortures. Here belongs the fear of\r\nopen places or the fear of touching certain objects, the fear of doing\r\nharm to others or the fear of deciding actions wrongly, the fear of\r\ndestroying valuable things or the fear of being the center of public\r\nattention, the fear of crowds or of closed doors, of altitudes or of\r\nbridges. And in all cases emotional reaction may set in with anxieties,\r\nand bodily symptoms such as palpitation of the heart may result,\r\nwhenever an effort is made to disregard the nervous fear. There is\r\nperhaps no group of patients which so much deserves the most careful\r\nefforts of the psychotherapist. Still more than the hysterics they\r\nsuffer from the fate of seeing their ills counted as not real. For them\r\neverybody has the good advice that they ought to overcome their fancies;\r\nand yet they feel their life ruined with their endless fight against the\r\noverpowering enemy. And if anywhere, it is here that the psychotherapist\r\nis successful. Psychasthenic fear can be removed, while the developed\r\nmelancholic depression, for instance, is entirely beyond the reach of\r\npsychical influence.\r\n\r\nWe have after all the same psychasthenic state before us when the\r\nobsession has impulsive character, from the mere abnormal impulse of\r\nlying, or making noise in a quiet place or crying in the dark, or\r\ntouching certain places, to that of stealing, indecent speech, arson,\r\nand perhaps even murder. The symptoms might easily be mistaken for those\r\nof graver diseases. Yet the fact that the patient himself really does\r\nnot will the effect at which he is aiming separates, mostly without\r\ndifficulty, the diagnosis of psychasthenia from that of insanity. Quite\r\nnearly related to it are the manifold variations of abnormal and\r\nperverse sexual tendencies. The psychiatrists are perhaps too much\r\ninclined to bring all these pathological impulses and desires, fears and\r\nanxieties, into the nearest neighborhood to real insanity. The\r\nindisputable success of psychotherapy in these spheres ought to add a\r\nwarning against these expansions of the strictly psychiatric domain. The\r\npsychologist will be more inclined to emphasize their relation to simple\r\nneurasthenia which itself imperceptibly shades over into our normal\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAll neurasthenic and psychasthenic disabilities show a certain emotional\r\ncontinuity and uniformity. It is the emotional instability and the quick\r\nalternation of symptoms which characterize hysteria or rather the\r\nhysterias. It seems as if science were near to the point of explaining\r\nthe hysterical disease by one common principle, but certainly the\r\nsymptoms are an inexhaustible manifold. The rapid changes of the intense\r\nmoods of the patient usually stand in the center. Torturing obsessions,\r\nabnormal impulses, over-suggestibility, hypochondriac depressions,\r\nparalysis of arms or legs, anæsthesia and paræsthesia, a mental stupor\r\nand confusion, illusions and perceptions of physiological symptoms may\r\nwork together in spite of his, or rather her clear intelligence. It is\r\nprobably on a hysteric basis also that somnambulic states arise during\r\nthe night, and from them a straight way leads to those mental attacks\r\nafter which the memory is entirely lost, or for which fundamental\r\nassociative connections are cut off. And from here we come to the\r\nexceptional cases of alternating personality. The more we recognize the\r\nmyriad symptoms in the hysteric patient as products of the emotional\r\ninstability, of autosuggestibility and of inhibition, the more we\r\nunderstand the almost miraculous result of psychotherapeutic treatment.\r\nAutosuggestions can be fought by countersuggestions, anæsthesia and\r\nparæsthesia can be removed often in an instant, dissociated\r\npersonalities may be built up again through hypnotism, the most severe\r\nbodily symptoms may disappear by influences in a waking state. Hysteria\r\nalone would justify the demand that every physician in his student days\r\npass with open eyes through the field of psychology. Quite near stand\r\nchorea and the epidemic impulses to imitative movements. And we might\r\nbring into this neighborhood also the disturbance in the equilibrium of\r\nthe speech movements through all degrees of stammering and severe\r\nimpairment. Up to a certain degree, though not often completely, they\r\ntoo yield easily to psychotherapeutic influence.\r\n\r\nWe enter now that region of constitutional disturbances in which\r\npsychotherapy is of small help. It leads from epilepsy to the periodic\r\ndiseases, especially the maniacal depressive insanity, the paranoia\r\nwhich develops late, and finally to states of idiocy which cover the\r\nwhole life. We are far from claiming that psychical influences are\r\nentirely powerless, the more as we insisted that psychotherapy goes much\r\nbeyond mere suggestions and appeals. No psychiatrist will work without\r\npsychological tools when he deals with the exultations of the maniac and\r\nthe depressions of the melancholic, with the hallucinations of\r\npersecution or the erotic insanities of the paranoiac. Still more the\r\nwhole register of psychology has to be used, when we are to educate the\r\nidiot and the imbecile. But the disappearance of the disease or of the\r\nchief symptoms through the mental agencies is in all these cases out of\r\nthe question. Only in incipient cases, especially of melancholia and\r\nmania, the psychotherapeutic work seems not entirely hopeless; and for\r\nepilepsy some distinct successes cannot be denied.\r\n\r\nWe have reviewed the whole field of psychophysical disturbances, those\r\nproduced through external conditions in the normal brain and those\r\nresulting from abnormal brain constitution. We have seen that the work\r\nof the psychotherapist is of very unequal value in different parts of\r\nthe field; in some, as in neurasthenia, in psychasthenia, in hysteria\r\nand similar regions most effective, in others like paresis or paranoia\r\nreduced to an almost insignificant factor. Where it can help and where\r\nnot we recognize as a mere question of experience. Certainly the\r\nseverity of the symptoms alone does not decide it. As the treatment is\r\nentirely empirical, no one can foresee whether or not the situation may\r\nchange to-morrow. We may find psychotherapeutic schemes by which\r\nepilepsy or maniacal depressive insanity or traumatic neuroses may\r\nbecome accessible. We simply do not know why we may remove stammering or\r\nsynthesize a dissociated personality or overcome an inborn sexual\r\nperversity, while we are unable to remove the depression of the\r\nmelancholic. Certainly the symptoms of the circulatory insanity\r\ndisappear completely in the free intervals; there is no reason to give\r\nup hope that psychotherapy might find the way to hasten the appearance\r\nof such a normal period.\r\n\r\nBut we have emphasized from the start that the psychotherapeutic work\r\nhas not only to set in when the disturbance itself lies in the\r\npsychophysical system. We may utilize the influence which the\r\nmind-brain system has for the whole body and thus may apply the\r\npsychical tool to work on the disturbances in the bodily apparatus. We\r\nmay discriminate a direct and an indirect influence in the psychical\r\ntreatment of bodily diseases. Transition from the foregoing group of\r\npsychical disturbances offers itself perhaps most easily through the\r\nstate of insomnia.\r\n\r\nThe causes of sleeplessness may still lie in the psychophysical sphere;\r\nrestless thoughts may inhibit the idea of sleep. The effect of sleep is\r\nagain in the sphere of the mind, the annihilation of conscious contents.\r\nBut the center which regulates and creates the sleep, probably by\r\ncontracting the blood-vessels, lies outside of the psychophysical system\r\nin the lower centers of the brain. The real disturbance thus lies in the\r\ninactivity of this purely bodily apparatus and mental influence which is\r\nto create sleep has therefore to work downwards from the mind to a\r\nbodily organ. In the same way many other non-psychical centers of the\r\nbrain may be brought to efficiency through psychophysical regulation.\r\n\r\nBut the therapeutic effect is certainly not confined to the central\r\nnervous system. Whithersoever the centrifugal nerves lead there the\r\nmind-brain system may have its curative influence. In the most startling\r\nway that is true for the digestive apparatus. The secretions of the\r\nstomach, the activity of the intestines can be influenced to a decree\r\nwhich it is difficult to explain. Important also is the relation to the\r\ncirculatory system, especially the disturbances of the heart:\r\ninnervation may be corrected, abnormal dilations and contractions of\r\nblood-vessels may be regulated. The bladder, uterus, even the pancreas\r\nand the liver seem to be influenced by the peripheral effects of the\r\ncentral excitement. And while no warning can be serious enough against\r\nthe absurd belief that diseases like cancer or tuberculosis can be cured\r\nby faith, it must be admitted that psychical influences under special\r\nconditions may have a retarding influence on any pathological process in\r\nthe organism. Much of that certainly is indirect influence but the\r\nphysician would be reckless if he should ignore the aid which may result\r\nfrom such indirect assistance. Even if psychotherapy could not do more\r\nin the treatment of bodily diseases than to secure a joyful obedience to\r\nthe strict demands of the physician, it would yet have to be accredited\r\nwith an extremely important service.\r\n\r\nIn a parallel line comes the effective aid by the stimulation of hope\r\nand the suppression of fear, by suggestion of a feeling of encouragement\r\nand the inhibition of the emotions of worry. This is a field where even\r\nthe average physician is most easily inclined to play the amateur\r\npsychotherapist. He knows how convalescence is disturbed by psychical\r\ndepression and how much more quickly health returns, if it is\r\nconfidently expected; he knows how many dangerous operations are\r\ndisturbed by despondency and helped by bravery; he knows what a blessed\r\nchange has come into the treatment of tuberculosis since a psychical\r\nfactor of social interest has set in; he knows how many ills disappear\r\nwhen regular occupation and interesting work are established or the\r\nstrain of distasteful work removed. Even the mere suppression of the\r\npain works backwards on the bodily disease which produces it. The pain\r\nwas a starting point for disturbing reactions; with its disappearance\r\nthrough psychotherapeutic influence, the reactions of the irritated\r\nbrain come to rest, the diseased body can carry on its struggle without\r\ninterference and may win the day. Often the psychical influence may not\r\neven change the symptoms at all but may remove other troublesome\r\neffects. The sufferer from locomotor ataxia may learn to walk again\r\nthrough mental education without any restitution of his spinal cord. In\r\nshort, there are endless ways in which psychical influence may work\r\ntowards the general health and towards the victory over bodily disease;\r\nand all that may be acknowledged without the slightest concession to the\r\nmetaphysical creeds of mental healers and Christian Scientists. But to\r\nmake use of those means and to harness such influences, it cannot be\r\nenough to rely on the common-sense of the physician any more than we\r\nshould trust the common-sense of the surgeon to use his knife without\r\ncondescending to the study of anatomy. The psychological study of the\r\nanatomy of the soul shows a not less complicated system of mental\r\ntissues and mental elements.\r\n\r\nTo enter into the full richness of this whole, large field of course\r\nlies entirely beyond the scope of our short discussion, which seeks as\r\nits only aim a clear recognition of the principles. Yet it seems\r\nessential to illustrate at least this sketch of the field by a more\r\ndetailed account of actual developments. Various ways of procedure might\r\nappear in order and the most natural one would be, of course, to pass\r\ndown from disease to disease and sketch special cases from diagnosis to\r\ncure. We might go through the various stages of neurasthenia and then\r\nthrough psychasthenia and then through hysteria and so on. And if we had\r\nto write a handbook for physicians, it would certainly be the desirable\r\nway, in spite of the too frequent repetitions which would become\r\nnecessary. But as our aim is only a discussion of principles of\r\npsychotherapy, we have no right to use this method. Moreover, such a\r\nmethod would suggest the misleading view that the psychotherapist is\r\ncalled and is able to treat diseases. All that he treats are symptoms\r\nand he ought not to pretend that he can do more, as long as he abstracts\r\nfrom all other therapeutic agencies. Psychotherapeutic influence may\r\nremove the phobia of a psychasthenic or the obsession of a neurasthenic\r\nor the emotion of a hysteric, and thus may bring not only momentary\r\nrelief but a change which may be favorable for general improvement, but\r\ncertainly the neurasthenia and psychasthenia and hysteria are not really\r\nremoved by it. Of course, even the treatment of symptoms demands a\r\nconstant reference to the whole background of the disease. The\r\ndepression of the neurasthenic must not be treated like the depression\r\nof the melancholic, the obsession of the psychasthenic must not be\r\nmixed with the fixed ideas of a paranoiac, the hysteric inability to\r\nwalk must not be confused with an injury of the motor nerves; in short,\r\neach symptom has to be treated as part of a complete situation. The\r\nefforts of the psychotherapist will move over as large a part of the\r\ndisease as possible and cover, perhaps, the causes of the disturbance as\r\nfar as they are of psychical origin. Yet it would remain dilettanteism\r\nif we were to accept the popular view that the mere psychotherapeutic\r\naid is a sufficient treatment of the whole disease. The physician has to\r\nbe much more than a psychotherapist. Our discussion only seeks to point\r\nout that whatever else he may be, he must be also a psychotherapist.\r\n\r\nThe more conservative method which befits us may be, therefore, the\r\nmethod of dealing with symptoms only and abstracting from the more\r\nambitious plan of discussing the diseases entire. We simply separate the\r\nmental symptoms and the bodily symptoms which the psychotherapist is to\r\nremove. And just in order to classify somehow the manifold mental\r\nsymptoms, we might separate those in the sphere of ideas, those in the\r\nsphere of emotions, and those in the sphere of volitions. Of course,\r\nnothing is further from such a plan than the old-fashioned belief that\r\nintellect, feeling, and will represent three independent faculties of\r\nthe soul. Modern psychology has not only substituted the millionfold\r\nphenomena for the schematic faculties, but emphasizes above all the\r\ninterconnectedness of the mental facts. There is no experience into\r\nwhich ideas, and feelings, and impulses do not enter together. And\r\ncorrespondingly we emphasized that on the physiological side too, every\r\nsensory excitement is at the same time the middle point of central\r\nirradiation and the starting point of motor activity. Thus there can be\r\nno disturbance of ideas which does not influence feeling and will, and\r\nvice versa. Yet it would be artificial to deny that any one of those\r\nvarious sides of the psychical process may come to prominence, sometimes\r\nthe impulse, sometimes the emotion, and sometimes the interplay of\r\nideas. The separation means only an abstraction, but it is an\r\nabstraction which is justified and suggested by the actual experiences.\r\nThus we shall deal with the psychical treatment of ideational,\r\nemotional, volitional, and bodily symptoms.\r\n\r\nCommon to our discussions will be only the effort to avoid everything\r\nwhich is exceptional and by its unusual complications apparently\r\nunexplainable and mysterious. The greater complexity of the case\r\ncertainly adds much fascination. Yet since we do not want to stimulate\r\nmere curiosity but clear understanding of the elements, we avoid every\r\nstartling record. We confine ourselves carefully to those perhaps\r\ntrivial experiences which daily enter into the view of those who come in\r\ncontact with suffering mankind. There will be no startling stories of\r\ndissociated personalities, such as appear perhaps every few years on the\r\nhorizon of the medical world, but we shall speak of those who every day\r\nin every town carry their trouble to the waiting room of the doctor and\r\nwho might return more happily if he had more well-trained interest in\r\nthe psychotherapeutic factors. Yet before we analyze some typical\r\nsymptoms, it might be wise to review the whole series of means and tools\r\nwhich the psychotherapist finds at his disposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL METHODS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe psychological work of the physician does not begin with his curative\r\nefforts. Therapy is always only the last step. Diagnosis and observation\r\nhave to precede, and an inquiry into the causes of the disease is\r\nessential, and in every one of these steps psychology may play its rôle.\r\nThe means of psychodiagnostic are not less manifold than those of\r\npsychotherapy. Moreover there the technique may be more complex and\r\nsubtle. The whole equipment of the modern laboratory ought to be put at\r\nits disposal. Perceptions and associations, reactions and expressions\r\nought to be examined with the same carefulness with which the\r\nconscientious physician examines the blood and the urine.\r\n\r\nA particular difficulty of the task more or less foreign to every other\r\nmedical inquiry is the intentional or unintentional effort of the\r\npatient to hide the sources of the trouble and to mislead as to their\r\ntrue character. Too often he is entirely unconscious of the sources of\r\ntrouble or else he has social reasons to deceive the world and himself,\r\nand ultimately the physician. And yet no psychical treatment can start\r\nsuccessfully so long as the patient is brooding on secret thoughts at\r\nthe bottom of his mind. The desire to hide them may often be itself a\r\npart of the disease. It is surprising how often unsuspected vistas of\r\nthoughts and impulses and emotions are opened by an inquiring analysis\r\nwhere the direct report of the patient does not awaken the least\r\nsuspicion. In the field of insanity, naturally the physician at once\r\ngoes to an examination on his own account, but in the borderland regions\r\nof the psychasthenics and hysterics and neurasthenics, the intellectual\r\nclearness of the patient too easily tempts one into trusting the\r\nsincerity of his story; and yet the most important ideas clustering\r\nperhaps about love or ambition, about vice or crime, about business\r\nfailure or family secrets, about inherited or acquired diseases may be\r\ncunningly withheld and may frustrate every psychotherapeutic influence.\r\nWhere suspicion is awake and mere confidential talk and persuasion seem\r\ninsufficient, the physician may feel justified in the interest of his\r\npatient in drawing the thoughts out of their hiding-place by artificial\r\nmeans. Skill, tact, and experience are needed there.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, in the overwhelming mass of cases the frankness\r\nand the good will of the patient himself will support the physician and\r\naccordingly his examination is not obliged to trap the patient but\r\nsimply to guide him to important points. But then begins the most\r\nessential study of diagnostical differentiation. With all the means not\r\nonly of psychology but of neurology and internal medicine, he has to\r\nseparate the particular case from similar ones and to examine whether\r\nhe deals with, for instance, a hysteric or with a paranoiac, with a\r\nneurasthenic or with a case of dementia præcox; and he will not forget\r\nthat there exist almost no symptoms of serious diseases which the\r\nnervous system of the hysteric may not imitate for a time. Not ours is\r\nthe task of analyzing special methods of neurological and mental\r\ndifferential diagnosis such as are used in the psychiatric clinic and in\r\nthe office of the nerve specialist. There the family history with\r\nreference to nervous and other diseases, the history of the patient\r\nhimself, the infectious diseases which he has passed through, his habits\r\nand anomalies, his use of alcohol and of drugs, his experiences in\r\nsocial life, the demands of his profession, his recent troubles and\r\ntheir first origin are to be recorded carefully. Then begins the\r\nphysical examination, the study of his sense organs and his nerves, of\r\nthe motor inabilities, the pains, the local anæsthesias and\r\nparæsthesias, the disturbances of the reflexes, of the spasms, tremors,\r\nconvulsions, and incoördinations, of the vasomotor and trophic\r\ndisorders, and so on. In a similar way the psychical examination tests\r\nthe hallucinations and illusions, the variations and defects of memory\r\nand attention, of judgment and reasoning, of orientation and\r\nself-consciousness, of emotions and volitions, of intellectual\r\ncapacities and organized actions. But we do not have to enter here into\r\na discussion of such diagnostic means; our chief interest belongs to the\r\ntherapy.\r\n\r\nThe variety of the psychotherapeutic methods is great and only some\r\ntypes are to be characterized here. But one rule is common to all of\r\nthem: never use psychotherapeutic methods in a schematic way like a\r\nrigid pattern. Schematic treatment is a poor treatment in every\r\ndepartment of medicine, but in psychotherapeutics it is disastrous.\r\nThere are no two cases alike and not only the easily recognizable\r\ndifferences of sex and age, and occupation and education, and financial\r\nmeans, and temperament and capacity are decisive, but all the subtle\r\nvariations of prejudices and beliefs, preferences and dislikes, family\r\nlife and social surroundings, ambitions and prospects, memories and\r\nfancies, diet and habits must carefully be considered. Every element of\r\na man's life history, impressions of early childhood, his love and his\r\nsuccesses, his diseases and his distresses, his acquaintances and his\r\nreading, his talent, his character, his sincerity, his energy, his\r\nintelligence--everything--ought to determine the choice of the\r\npsychotherapeutic steps. As it is entirely impossible to determine all\r\nthose factors by any sufficient inquiry, most of the adjustment of\r\nmethod must be left to the instinct of the physician, in which wide\r\nexperience, solid knowledge, tact, and sympathy ought to be blended.\r\nEven the way in which the patient reacts on the method will often guide\r\nthe instinct of the well-trained psychotherapist.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore certainly not enough that the knowledge of the physician\r\nsimply decide beforehand on a definite course of psychical treatment and\r\nleave the carrying out to a well-meaning minister or any other medical\r\namateur who schematically follows the indicated path. The finest\r\nadjustment has to come in during the treatment itself and the response\r\nof the patient often has to suggest entirely new lines of procedure.\r\nMore than in any other field of medicine, the physician himself has to\r\nextend his influence far beyond the office hours and the strictly\r\nmedical relations. And yet, on the other hand, there is no department of\r\nmedicine in which the treatment might not profit by the\r\npsychotherapeutic influence. With a few vague words of encouragement\r\nmechanically uttered, or with a routine of tricks of suggestion by bread\r\npills and colored water and tuning forks, not much will be gained even\r\nin the ordinary physician's practice. Subtle adjustment to the personal\r\nneeds and to the individual conditions is necessary in every case where\r\nthe psychical factor is to play an important rôle. It cannot be denied\r\nthat the one great obstacle in the work of the routine physician is the\r\nlack of time and patience which is needed for successful treatment. To\r\nprescribe drugs is always quicker than to influence the mind; to cure a\r\nmorphinist by hyoscine needs less effort than to cure him by suggestion.\r\n\r\nThe first method to bring back the psychophysical equilibrium is of\r\ncourse the one which is also demanded by common-sense, namely, to remove\r\nthe external sources of the disturbance. External indicates there not\r\nonly the outer world but also the own body outside the conscious parts\r\nof the brain. If we take it in the widest meaning, this would evidently\r\ninclude every possible medical task from filling a painful tooth to\r\noperating on a painful appendix, as in every case where pain results,\r\nthe mental equilibrium is disturbed by it and the normal mental life of\r\nthe patient reduced in its efficiency. But in the narrower sense of the\r\nword, we shall rather think of those sources of trouble in the organism\r\nitself which interfere directly with the mental functions. The\r\nexamination of any public school quickly leads to the discovery that\r\nmuch which is taken for impaired mental activity, for lack of attention,\r\nfor stupidity, or laziness may be the result of defective hearing or\r\nsight or abnormal growth of the adenoids. Growths in the nose may be\r\noperated upon, the astigmatic or the short-sighted eye may be corrected\r\nby glasses, the child who is hard of hearing may at least be seated near\r\nthe teacher; and the backward children quickly reach the average level.\r\nNo doubt in the life of the adult as well, often almost insignificant\r\nand from a strictly physical point of view unimportant abnormities in\r\nthe bodily system, especially in the digestive and sexual spheres, are\r\nsources of irritation which slowly influence the whole personality. To\r\nbe sure, the brain disturbance may have reached a point where the mere\r\nremoval of the original affliction is not sufficient to reinstate the\r\nnormal balance of mental energies, but wherever such a bodily irritation\r\ngoes on, it is never too late to abolish it in the interests of\r\npsychotherapy.\r\n\r\nThe less evident and yet even more important source of the painful\r\nintrusions may lie outside of the organism in the social surroundings\r\nand conditions of life. Most of that has to be accepted. The physician\r\ncannot bring back the friend who died or the fortune which was lost in\r\nspeculation or the man who married another girl. He will even avoid\r\nsuggesting far-reaching social changes in the private life of the\r\npatient, changes like divorce in an unhappy marriage or the breaking of\r\nthe home ties, however often he may get the impression that such a\r\nliberation would stop the source of the mental trouble. He will be the\r\nmore careful not to overstep his medical rights as he seldom has the\r\npossibility to judge fairly on the basis of the one-sided complaint, and\r\nthe probability is great that the character and temperament of the\r\ncomplainant may be a more essential factor of the ailment than the\r\npersonalities which surround him. Yet even the conservative physician\r\nwill find abundant opportunities for advice which will remove disturbing\r\nenergies from the social surroundings of the sufferer. Even a short\r\nrelease from the burdening duties, a short vacation from the incessant\r\nneeds of the nursery, a break in the monotony of the office, may often\r\ndo wonders with a neurasthenic. Often within a surprisingly short time\r\nthe brain gathers the energies to overcome the frictions with\r\nunavoidable surroundings.\r\n\r\nYet here the physician has to adjust the prescribed dose of outing very\r\ncarefully to the special case. We may be guided by the psychological\r\nexperiments which have been made in the interest of testing the fatigue\r\ninduced by mental work. If perhaps four hours of concentrated work are\r\ndone without pauses, experiment shows that the quality of the work\r\ndeteriorates, measured for instance by the number of mistakes in quick\r\ncalculation. If certain relatively long pauses are introduced, the\r\nstandard of work can be kept high all through. But if frequent pauses\r\nare made, and each short, the result is with many individuals the\r\nopposite. The experiment indicates that these frequent pauses are\r\nworking as interruptions which hinder the perfect adjustment to the work\r\nin hand. That is suggestive. Our neurasthenic may complain about the\r\nlife which he has to live and yet after all he is frequently so\r\ncompletely adjusted to it that it may not be in his interest to remove\r\nhim far away from the conditions which cannot ultimately be changed but\r\nto which he has to return. The instinct of the physician has to find the\r\nmiddle way between a temporary removal of irritation which really allows\r\na development of new energies and a mere interruption which simply\r\ndamages the acquired relative adjustment. Every cause of friction which\r\ncan be permanently annihilated for the patient certainly should be\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nThis negative remedy demands its positive supplement. The patient must\r\nbe brought under conditions and influences which give fair chances for\r\nthe recuperation of his energies. Too often from the standpoint of the\r\npsychologist, the prescription is simply rest. As far as rest involves\r\nsleep, it is certainly the ideal prescription. There is no other\r\ninfluence which builds up the injured central nervous system as safely\r\nas sound natural sleep, and loss of sleep is certainly one of the most\r\npernicious conditions for the brain. Again rest is a great factor in\r\nthose systematic rest cures which for a long while were almost the\r\nfashion with the neurologist. Experience has shown that their\r\nstereotyped use is often unsuccessful, and moreover that the advantage\r\ngained by those months spent in bed completely isolated and overfed is\r\nperhaps due to the separation and changed nutrition more than to the\r\noverlong absolute rest. Yet used with discrimination, the physiological\r\nand the psychical effect of lying in bed for a few weeks has certainly\r\noften been a marked improvement, especially with young women. But more\r\noften the idea of rest in bed during daytime is not meant at all when\r\nthe nerve specialist recommends rest to his over-strained patient. It is\r\nsimply meant that he give up his fatiguing daily work, even if that work\r\nis made up of a round of entertainments and calls and social\r\nengagements. The neurasthenic and all similar varieties are sent away\r\nfrom the noise of the city, away from the rush of their busy life, away\r\nfrom telephones and street cars, away from the hustling business and\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nIndeed it is the dogma of most official and unofficial doctors that the\r\nrestlessness and hurry and noise which all are characteristic of the\r\ntechnical conditions of our time are the chief sources of the prevailing\r\nnervousness. There was no time in the history of civilization in which\r\nthe average man was overwhelmed by so many demands on his nerve energy,\r\nno time which asked such an abundance of interests even from the school\r\nchild. The wild chase for luxury in the higher classes, reënforced by\r\nthe commercialism of our time, the hard and monotonous labor in our\r\nmodern mills and mines for the lower classes, the over-excitement\r\nbrought to everybody by the sensationalism of our newspapers and of our\r\npublic life all injure the brain cells and damage the equilibrium. That\r\nis a story which we hear a thousand times nowadays. Yet it is doubtful\r\nwhether there is really much truth in such a claim and whether much wise\r\npsychotherapy can be deduced from it.\r\n\r\nWe may begin even with the very justifiable doubt whether nervousness\r\nreally has increased in our time. Earlier periods had not so many names\r\nfor those symptoms and were not able to discriminate them with the same\r\nclearness. Above all, the milder forms of abnormities were not looked on\r\nas pathological disturbances. If a man has a pessimistic temperament, or\r\nhas fits of temper, or cannot get rid of a sad memory idea, or imagines\r\nthat he feels an illness which he does not have, or has no energy to\r\nwork, even today most people are still without suspicion that a\r\nneurasthenic or a psychasthenic or a hysteric disturbance of the nervous\r\nsystem may be in its beginning. Earlier times surely may have treated\r\neven the stronger varieties of this kind as troublesome variations in\r\nthe sphere of the normal. On the other hand, there can be no doubt that,\r\nfor instance, the Middle Ages developed severe diseases of the nervous\r\nsystem in an almost epidemic way which is nearly unknown to our time.\r\n\r\nAs to the conditions of life itself, there are certainly many factors at\r\nwork which secure favorable influences for our cerebral activity. The\r\nprogress of scientific hygiene has brought everyone much nearer to a\r\nharmonious functioning of the organism, and the progress of technique\r\nhas removed innumerable difficulties from the play of life. Of course,\r\nwe stand today before a much more complex surrounding than our ancestors\r\nbut still more quickly than the complexity have grown the means to\r\nmaster it. We have to know more: yet the effort has not become greater\r\nsince it has become easier to acquire knowledge. We have to endure much\r\ndisturbing noise, and yet we forget how the sense organs of our\r\nforefathers must have been maltreated, for instance, by flickering\r\nlight. We are in a rush of work and stand in thousandfold connections;\r\nand yet the neural energy which is demanded is not large because a\r\nthousand devices of our technical life have become our obedient\r\nservants. There is no nation on earth which is more proud of its rush\r\nand its hurry than the American people; and yet what an abundance of\r\ntime is leisurely wasted that would have to be used for work if the\r\ncountry could not live from its richness. Moreover our life has probably\r\nbecome cooler, there is less emotionalism, less sentimentality, more\r\nbusiness-like attitude, and that all means less inner friction and\r\nexcitement; in public life too, less fear of war and less religious\r\nstruggle. All has become a question of administration and efficiency.\r\nOur time is certainly not worse off on the score of neurasthenia than\r\nits predecessors.\r\n\r\nAbove all the intensity of mental stimuli is always relative. The\r\npsychologist knows the experiments which determine that we perceive the\r\ndifference of impressions as alike when the stimuli are proportional.\r\nIf I have a ten-pound weight in one hand, I may find that I must have\r\none pound more in the other hand to discriminate the difference. Now if\r\nI take twenty pounds in the one hand, then it is not sufficient to have\r\none pound more in the other, but I must have twenty-two pounds in the\r\nother to feel a difference, and if I take thirty pounds, the other\r\nweight must be thirty-three. We feel equal differences when the weights\r\nstand in the same relation. The man who owns a hundred dollars will\r\nenjoy the gain of five and regret the loss of five just as much as the\r\nowner of a hundred thousand dollars would feel the gain or loss of five\r\nthousand. This fundamental law of the relativity of psychical\r\nimpressions controls our whole life. The rush of stimuli which might\r\nmean a source of nervous disturbance for the villager whose quiet\r\ncountry life has brought about an adjustment to faint impressions may\r\ncause very slight stimulation for the metropolitan accustomed for a\r\nlifetime to the rhythm of the surroundings. Yet that quiet countryman\r\nmay react in his narrow system not less when the modest changes in his\r\nsurroundings provoke him. The gossip of his neighbor may undermine his\r\nnervous system just as much as a political fight or the struggles of the\r\nexchange that of the city man.\r\n\r\nThe same holds true for the purely intellectual engagements. The work\r\nwhich the scholar undertakes should not be measured by the effect which\r\nthe same appeal to concentrated attention would make on the average man\r\nof practical life. There, too, an adjustment to the demand has resulted\r\nduring the whole period of training and professional work. Every effort\r\nshould be estimated with reference to the standard of the particular\r\ncase. This relativity of the mental reaction on the demands of life must\r\nalways be in the foreground of the psychotherapeutic régime. Even the\r\nbest physicians too often sin against this principle and accuse the life\r\nwhich a man or woman leads as too exhausting and overstraining simply\r\nbecause it would be overstraining and exhausting to others who are not\r\nadjusted to that special standard. Simply to withdraw a patient from the\r\none kind of life and to force on him a new kind with new standards may\r\nnot be a gain at all. A new adjustment begins and smaller differences\r\nfrom the standard may bring about the same strong intensities of\r\nreaction as the large differences brought before. Complete rest, for\r\ninstance, for a hard brain-worker hardly ought to be recommended unless\r\na high degree of exhaustion has come on. If routine prescriptions are to\r\nbe admitted at all, they should not be complete rest or complete change\r\nof life for any length of time but a continuation of the life for which\r\nadjustment has been learned with a reasonable reduction of the demands\r\nand stimulations. The intellectual worker ought to decrease his work,\r\nthe overbusy society woman ought to stay in bed one day in the week, the\r\nman in the midst of the rush of life ought to cut down his obligations,\r\nbut probably each of them does better to go on than simply to swear off\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nTheir rest ought to have the character of vacation; that means\r\ninterruptions without the usual activity ought to be short periods spent\r\nwith the distinct feeling that they are interruptions of that which must\r\nlast and that they are not themselves to become lasting states. Thus the\r\ninner adjustment to the work ought to be kept up and ought not to be\r\nsubstituted by a new adjustment to a less exacting life. In this way the\r\nepisode of the vacation rest ought to be in a way included in the\r\nstrenuous life almost as a part of its programme. Strenuosity must not\r\nmean an external rush with the gestures of overbusy excitement, but\r\ncertainly the doctrine of the lazy life is wretched psychotherapy, as\r\nlong as no serious illness is in question. By far the best alteration\r\nis, therefore, even in the periods of interruption, not simply rest but\r\nnew engagements which awaken new interests and stimulate neglected\r\nmental factors, disburdening the over-strained elements of mental life.\r\nThe most effective agency for this task is contact with beauty, beauty\r\nin nature and life, beauty in art and literature and music. To enjoy a\r\nlandscape ought to be not merely a negative rest for the man of the\r\noffice building, and good literature or music absorbs the mental\r\nenergies and harmonizes them. In the second place come games and sport,\r\nwhich may enter into their right if fatigue can be avoided. Harmonious\r\njoyful company, as different as possible from the depressing company of\r\nthe sanitariums, will add its pleasantness.\r\n\r\nWhile the advice of the physician ought thus to emphasize the positive\r\nelements which work, not towards rest, but toward a harmonious mental\r\nactivity, we must not forget some essential negative prescriptions.\r\nEverything is to be avoided which interferes with the night's sleep.\r\nFurthermore, in the first place, alcohol must be avoided. There cannot\r\nbe any doubt that alcoholic intemperance is one of the chief sources of\r\nbrain disturbances and that the fight against intemperance, which in\r\nthis country is essentially the fight against the disgusting saloon, is\r\na duty of everyone who wants to prevent nervous disaster. There may and\r\nmust be divergence of opinion as to the safest way to overcome\r\nintemperance. The conservative physician will feel grave doubt whether\r\nthe hasty recommendation of complete prohibition is such a safe way,\r\nwhether it does not contain many conditions of evil, and whether the\r\nfight against the misuse of alcohol will not be more successful if a\r\ntrue education for temperance is accepted as the next goal. But for the\r\nman of neurasthenic constitution and for any brain of weak resistance,\r\nthe limit for permissible alcoholic beverages ought to be drawn very\r\nnarrow and in such cases temporary abstinence is usually the safest\r\nadvice. Individual cases must indicate where a glass of light beer with\r\nthe meal or a glass of a mild wine may be permissible. Strong drinks\r\nlike cocktails are absolutely to be excluded. In the same way a strong\r\nreduction is advisable in tobacco, tea, and especially coffee. A\r\ncomplete withdrawal of all stimulations to which a nervous system has\r\nbeen accustomed for years is not wise, or at least mild substitutes\r\nought to be suggested, but if coffee can be ruled out at once, often\r\nmuch is gained. In the same way all passionate excitements are to be\r\neliminated and sexual life to be wisely regulated. An especial warning\r\nsignal is to be posted before all strong emotions, and if the patient\r\ncannot be asked to leave his worry at home, he can at least be asked to\r\navoid situations which will necessarily lead to excitement and quarrel\r\nand possible disappointment.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the surest tests of psychotherapeutic skill to discriminate\r\nwisely whether one or the other of these features of general treatment\r\nought to be emphasized. They usually demand more insight than specific\r\nforms of psychotherapy like hypnotic suggestions. These general efforts\r\nare also much more directed against the disease itself where the\r\nspecific methods are merely directed against the symptoms. The\r\nseparation from disturbing surroundings, the reduction of engagements\r\nand work, the complete rest, the suppression of artificial stimulants,\r\nthe enjoyment of art, of nature, of sport, the distractions of social\r\nlife, each might be in one case a decisive help and indifferent, perhaps\r\neven harmful in another. All is a matter of choice and adjustment to the\r\nparticular needs in which all the personal factors of inherited\r\nconstitution, acquired adjustments, social surroundings, temperament,\r\nand education, and the probable later development have to be most\r\ntactfully weighed. Yet this general treatment may take and very often\r\nought to take the opposite direction, not towards rest but towards work,\r\nnot towards light distraction but towards serious effort, not towards\r\nreduction of engagements but towards energetic regulation. We said that\r\nit was an exaggeration to blame the external conditions of our life, the\r\ntechnical manifoldness of our surroundings as the source of the\r\nwidespread nervousness. The mere complexity of the life, the rapidity of\r\nthe demands, the amount of intellectual effort is in itself not\r\ndangerous and our time is not more pernicious than the past has been;\r\nbut it is perhaps no exaggeration to say that our time is by many of its\r\nfeatures more than the past tending towards an unsound inner attitude of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nMuch of the present civilization leads the average man and woman to a\r\nsuperficiality and inner hastiness which undermines sound mental life\r\nmuch more than the external factors. We look with a condescending smile\r\nat the old-fashioned periods in which the demands of authority and\r\ndiscipline controlled the education of the child and after all the\r\neducation of the adult to his last days. We have substituted for it the\r\ndemand of freedom with all its blessings, but instead of the blessings\r\nwe too often get all its vices. A go-as-you-please method characterizes\r\nour whole society from the kindergarten to the height of life. We\r\neulogize the principle of following the paths of own true interest and\r\nmean by that too often paths of least resistance. Study becomes play,\r\nthe child learns a hundred things but does not learn the most important\r\none, to do his duty and to do it accurately and with submission to a\r\ngeneral purpose. The power of attention thus never becomes trained, the\r\nenergy to concentrate on that which is not interesting by its own\r\nappeal is slowly lost, a flabby superficiality must set in which is\r\nmoved by nothing but the personal advantage and the zigzag impulses of\r\nthe chance surroundings. He who has never learned obedience can never\r\nbecome his own master, and whoever is not his own master through all his\r\nlife lacks the mental soundness and mental balance which a harmonious\r\nlife demands. Flippancy and carelessness, haphazard interests and\r\nrecklessness must result, mediocrity wins the day, cheap aims pervade\r\nthe social life, hasty judgments, superficial emotions, trivial\r\nproblems, sensational excitements, and vulgar pleasures appeal to the\r\nmasses. Yellow papers and vaudeville shows--vaudeville shows on the\r\nstage, in the courtroom, on the political platform, in the pulpit of the\r\nchurch--are welcome, and of all the results, one is the most immediate,\r\nthe disorganization of the brain energies.\r\n\r\nA sound mind is a well-organized mind in which a controlling idea is\r\nable to inhibit the opposites and is in no danger of being overrun by\r\nany chance intrusion into the mind. This power is the act of attention.\r\nAn attention which is trained and disciplined can hold its ideas against\r\nchance impulses. An untrained attention is attracted by everything which\r\nis loud and shining, big and amusing. The trouble is not with the rush\r\nand hurry of the impressions which demand our attention; the trouble is\r\nwith our attention which seeks a quick change of new and ever new\r\nimpressions because it is not disciplined to hold firmly to one\r\nimportant interest. We want the hundred short-cut superficial magazines\r\nbecause we lack the energy to study one large volume; we want the\r\nthousand engagements because we are not concentrated enough to devote\r\nourselves fully to one ideal task. The strong mind may find its sound\r\nadjustment even without such training for concentrated attention through\r\nobedience and discipline but the weak mind has to pay the penalty. For\r\nnot a few it will mean social disaster. Yet our society is sufficiently\r\nadapted to this state so that it gives some good social chances to the\r\nsuperficial too, and this not only to the rich, but to those on every\r\nlevel. Only the nervous system cannot so easily be adjusted to the new\r\nrégime. The loose interplay of the brain cells without the serious\r\ntraining of discipline must involve disorganization of the mind-brain\r\nsystem which may count often most powerfully in those spheres in which\r\nthe mere needs of life are felt the least. There is only one great\r\nremedy: discipline, training for concentrated attention, for a work in\r\nsubmission of will to a steady purpose. And psychotherapeutic effort\r\nwill often demand such a training for work rather than a reduction of\r\nwork and rest.\r\n\r\nThe most alarming product of the neglect in training is found in many of\r\nthose retarded children who at fifteen show the intelligence of a boy of\r\neight. They are not imbeciles and do not belong in the psychiatric\r\ndomain; their development has simply been suspended by a mistaken\r\neducation. Of course no neglect would have led to it without a\r\nconstitutional, inherited weakness of the central nervous system, but\r\nthe weakness would never have led to the retardation if perhaps a\r\nmistaken parental indulgence had not allowed a life without forced\r\neffort and, therefore, without progress. Even such extreme cases may not\r\nshow on the surface. The boy may pass as all right if we meet him at a\r\nball; only his tutor knows the whole misery. Still less does the surface\r\nview of many a grown-up neurasthenic alarm us who seems to live a\r\nwell-ordered, perhaps an enviable life, and yet who suffers the penalty\r\nof a life without concentrated effort, really without anything to do in\r\nspite of a thousand engagements. Moreover this lack of important\r\nactivity may often be forced on our patients. Married women without\r\nchildren, without household responsibilities, and without interests of\r\ntheir own and without strong nervous constitution will soon lose the\r\npower of effort and their brain will succumb. A dreary monotony is\r\ndangerous even for the worker; for the non-worker it may be ruinous.\r\n\r\nYet mere flippant excitement and superficial entertainment is nothing\r\nbut a cheap counterfeit of what is needed. Voluntary effort is needed,\r\nand this is the field where the psychotherapist must put in his most\r\nintelligent effort. There is no one for whom there is not a chance for\r\nwork in our social fabric. The prescription of work has not only to be\r\nadjusted to the abilities, the knowledge, and social condition, but has\r\nto be chosen in such a way that it is full of associations and\r\nultimately of joyful emotions. Useless work can never confer the\r\ngreatest benefits; mere physical exercises are therefore\r\npsychophysically not as valuable as real sport while physically, of\r\ncourse, the regulated exercises may be far superior to the haphazard\r\nwork in sport. To solve picture puzzles, even if they absorb the\r\nattention for a week, can never have the same effect as a real interest\r\nin a human puzzle. There is a chance for social work for every woman and\r\nevery man, work which can well be chosen in full adjustment to the\r\npersonal preference and likings. Not everybody is fit for charity work,\r\nand those who are may be entirely unfitted for work in the interest of\r\nthe beautification of the town. Only it has to be work; mere\r\nautomobiling to charity places or talking in meetings on problems which\r\nhave not been studied will, of course, be merely another form of the\r\ndisorganizing superficiality. The hysterical lady on Fifth Avenue and\r\nthe psychasthenic old maid in the New England country town both simply\r\nhave to learn to do useful work with a concentrated effort and a high\r\npurpose. From a long experience I have to confess that I have seen that\r\nthis unsentimental remedy is the safest and most important prescription\r\nin the prescription book of the psychotherapist.\r\n\r\nThere is one more feature of general treatment which seems almost a\r\nmatter of course, and yet which is perhaps the most difficult to apply\r\nbecause it cannot simply be prescribed: the sympathy of the\r\npsychotherapist. The feelings with which an operation is performed or\r\ndrugs given do not determine success, but when we build up a mental\r\nlife, the feelings are a decisive factor. To be sure, we must not forget\r\nthat we have to deal here with a causal and not with a purposive point\r\nof view. Our sympathy is therefore not in question in its moral value\r\nbut only as a cause of a desired effect. It is therefore not really our\r\nsympathy which counts but the appearance of sympathy, the impression\r\nwhich secures the belief of the patient that sympathy for him exists.\r\nThe physician who, although full of real sympathy, does not understand\r\nhow to express it and make it felt will thus be less successful than his\r\ncolleague who may at heart remain entirely indifferent but has a\r\nskillful routine of going through the symptoms of sympathy. The\r\nsympathetic vibration of the voice and skillful words and suggestive\r\nmovements may be all that is needed, but without some power of awakening\r\nthis feeling of personal relation, almost of intimacy, the wisest\r\npsychotherapeutic treatment may remain ineffective. That reaches its\r\nextreme in those frequent cases in which social conditions have brought\r\nabout an emotional isolation of the patient and have filled him with an\r\ninstinctive longing to break his mental loneliness, or in the still more\r\nfrequent cases where the patient's psychical sufferings are\r\nmisunderstood or ridiculed as mere fancies or misjudged as merely\r\nimaginary evils. Again everything depends upon the experience and tact\r\nof the physician. His sympathy may easily overdo the intention and\r\nfurther reënforce the patient's feeling of misery or make him an\r\nhypochondriac. It ought to be sympathy with authority and sympathy which\r\nalways at the same time shows the way to discipline. Under special\r\nconditions it is even advisable to group patients with similar diseases\r\ntogether and to give them strength through the natural mutual sympathy;\r\nyet this too can be in question only where this community becomes a\r\nstarting point for common action and common effort, not for mere common\r\ndepression. In this way a certain psychical value must be acknowledged\r\nfor the social classes of tuberculosis as they have recently been\r\ninstituted.\r\n\r\nFrom sympathy it is only one step to encouragement, which indeed is\r\neffective only where sympathy or at least belief in sympathy exists. He\r\nwho builds up a new confidence in a happy future most easily brings to\r\nthe patient also that self-control and energy which is the greatest of\r\nhelping agencies. The physical and mental efforts of the physician are\r\nalike deprived of their best efficiency if they are checked by worry and\r\nfear that the developments of the disease will be disastrous. As soon as\r\nnew faith in life is given, and given even where a sincere prognosis\r\nmust be a sad one, a great and not seldom unexpected improvement is\r\nsecured. There is no doubt that the routine physician is doing by far\r\ntoo little in these respects. His instinctive feeling that disease is a\r\ncausal process, and that he should therefore keep away from the\r\npurposive attitude, leads him too easily to a dangerous narrowness. He\r\ntreats disease as if it were an isolated process and overlooks the\r\nthousandfold connections in which the nervous system stands with the\r\npatient's whole life experience in past and future. The physician is\r\nthus too easily inclined to underestimate the good which may come in the\r\nfight against disease from the ideas and emotions which form the\r\nbackground of the mind of the patient. Even if the disease cannot be\r\nvanquished, the mental disturbances which result from it, the pains and\r\ndiscomforts, may be inhibited, as soon as hopes and joyful purposes gain\r\na dominating control of the mind. The nervous patient often needs a\r\nlarger hold upon life, while the routine prescriptions may too easily\r\nreduce that hold by fixing the attention on the symptoms.\r\n\r\nHere then is the right place for the moral appeal and the religious\r\nstimulation. How psychotherapy is related to the church will interest us\r\nlater. At this moment morality and religion are for us not inspirations\r\nbut medicines. But from such a causal point of view, we should not\r\nunderestimate the manifold good which can come from the causal effect of\r\nreligious and ethical ideas. Those faith curists who bring mutual help\r\nby impressing each other with the beauty and goodness of the world\r\nreally bring new strength to the wavering mind; and the most natural\r\nchannel for religious help remains, of course, the word of the minister\r\nand the own prayer. Religion may work there causally in a double way.\r\nThe own personality is submerging into a larger all-embracing hold and\r\nthus inhibits the small cares and troubles of merely personal origin.\r\nThe consciousness sinks into God, a mental process which reaches its\r\nmaximum in mysticism. The haphazard pains of the personality disappear\r\nand are suppressed by the joy and glory of the whole. This submission of\r\nwill under a higher will and its inhibitory effect for suppression of\r\ndisturbing symptoms must be wonderfully reënforced by the attitude of\r\nprayer. Even the physiological conditions of it, the clasping of the\r\nhands, the kneeling, and monotonous sounds reënforce this inhibition of\r\nthe insignificant dissatisfactions. On the other hand, contact with the\r\ngreater will must open the whole reservoir of suppressed energies, and\r\nthis outbreak of hidden forces may work towards the regeneration of the\r\nwhole psychophysical system. Neglected functions of the brain become\r\nreleased and give to the mind an energy and discipline and self-control\r\nand mastery of difficulties which restitutes the whole equilibrium, and\r\nwith the equilibrium comes a new calmness and serenity which may react\r\nalmost miraculously on the entire nervous system and through it on the\r\nwhole organism and its metabolism.\r\n\r\nSeen from a causal point of view, however, there is no miracle in it at\r\nall. On the contrary, it is a natural psychophysical process which\r\ndemands careful supervision not to become dangerous. It is not the value\r\nof the religion which determines the improvement, and it is not God who\r\nmakes the cure; or to speak less irreligiously, the physician ought to\r\nsay that if it is God who cures through the prayer, it is not less God\r\nwho cures in other cases through bromide and morphine, and on the other\r\nside just as God often refuses to cure through the prescribed drugs of\r\nthe drug store, God not less often refuses to cure through prayer and\r\nchurch influence. But the real standpoint of the physician will be to\r\nconsider both the drugs and the religious ideas merely as causal\r\nagencies and to try to understand the conditions of their efficiency\r\nand the limits which are set for them. From such a point of view, he\r\nwill certainly acknowledge that submission to a greater power is a\r\nsplendid effect of inhibition and at the same time a powerful effect for\r\nthe stimulation of unused energies; but he will recognize also that the\r\nuse of those silent energies is not without dangers.\r\n\r\nCertainly nature has supplied us with a reservoir of normally unused\r\npsychophysical strength, to which we may resort just as the tissues of\r\nour body may nourish us for a few days when we are deprived of food, but\r\nsuch supply, which in exceptional cases may become the last refuge,\r\ncannot be used without a serious intrusion and interference with the\r\nnormal household of mind and body. To extract these lowest layers of\r\nenergies may mean for the psychophysical system a most exhausting effort\r\nwhich may soon bring a reaction of physical and nervous weakness. The\r\nchances are great that such a religious excitement, if it is really to\r\nhave a deep effect, may go over into a mystic fascination which leads to\r\nhysteria or into an exhausting eruption of energies which ends in\r\nneurasthenic after-effects. The immediate successes of the strong\r\nreligious influence on the weakened nervous system, especially on the\r\nnervous system of a weak inherited constitution, are too often stage\r\neffects which do not last. From a mere purposive point of view, they may\r\nbe complete successes. They may have turned the immoral man into a moral\r\nman, the skeptic into a believer, but the physician cannot overlook\r\nthat the result may be a moral man with a crippled nervous system, a\r\nbeliever with psychasthenic symptoms. From the point of view of the\r\nchurch, there cannot be too much religion; from a therapeutic point of\r\nview, religion works there like any other nervous remedy of which five\r\ngrains may help and fifty grains may be ruinous.\r\n\r\nMoreover this power of inhibiting the little troubles of the body and of\r\nbringing to work and effectiveness the deepest powers of the mind\r\nbelongs not less to any other important idea and overpowering purpose.\r\nThe soldier in battle does not feel the pain of his wound, and in an\r\nemergency everybody develops powers of which he was not aware. The same\r\neffect which religion produces may thus be secured by any other deep\r\ninterest: service for a great human cause, enthusiasm for a gigantic\r\nplan, even the prospect of a great personal success. Thus in a\r\npsychotherapeutic system, religion has only to take its place in line\r\nwith many other efforts to inhibit the feeling of misery and to\r\nreënforce will and self-control by submission under a greater will. That\r\nin the case of religion this submission, from an entirely different\r\npurposive point of view, also has a moral and religious value, has in\r\nitself no relation to the question of its therapeutic character. It\r\nought not to lead to any one-sided preference, inasmuch as religiously\r\nindifferent agencies may be in the particular case a more reliable means\r\nof improvement. Moreover the psychological symptoms are, after all, only\r\na fraction of the disease and very different bodily factors, digestion\r\nand nutrition, heart and lungs and sexual organs may be most intimately\r\nconnected with the disturbance of the equilibrium. Medicine today no\r\nlonger believes that hysteria originates in the diseases of the uterus\r\nor that neurasthenia necessarily results from insufficiencies of the\r\nstomach, but it would be a graver mistake to believe that mental factors\r\nalone decide the progress of the disease, however prominent the mental\r\nsymptoms may be in it.\r\n\r\nFrom the physician's encouragement and the minister's influence towards\r\nnew faith in life, a short way leads to the influence of suggestion. It\r\nis on the whole the way which leads from the general psychotherapeutic\r\ntreatment to the specific one directed against particular symptoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHE SPECIAL METHODS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course there is no abrupt division between special and general\r\nmethods. Yet the different tendency is easily recognized, if we turn\r\nonly, for instance, from the mere sympathy and encouragement to the\r\nmethod of reasoning with the patient about the origin of his special\r\ncomplaint. Just now the medical profession moves along this line a great\r\ndeal. Of course no well-trained psychotherapist will make the blunder of\r\narguing with the insane. To dispute by argument with the paranoiac and\r\nto try to convince him would not be only without success, but easily\r\nirritating. This does not mean that the not less amateurish way ought to\r\nbe taken of accepting his delusions and appearing to be in full\r\nagreement with him. A tactful middle way, preferably a disciplinary\r\nignoring attitude, ought to be taken. But it is entirely different with\r\nthe mental states of the psychasthenic. The mere statement and objective\r\nproof that his obsession is based on an illusion would be ineffective.\r\nHe knows that himself, but he may take the disturbance as the beginning\r\nof a brain disease, as a form of insanity, as a lasting damage which\r\nlies entirely beyond his control. Now the physician explains to him how\r\nit all came about. He shows to him that the symptoms resulted merely\r\nfrom autosuggestion or are the after-effects of a suggestion from\r\nwithout or of a forgotten emotional experience of the past. That is a\r\nnew idea to the patient and one which changes the aspect and may have an\r\ninhibitory influence.\r\n\r\nOf course, the patient does not accept the explanation at once. He feels\r\nsure that he is not accessible to suggestion and that he has least of\r\nall a tendency to autosuggestions, but the skillful psychotherapist will\r\nfind somewhere an opening for the entering wedge. He may develop to the\r\npatient the modern theories of the origin of neurotic disturbances, all\r\nwith entire sincerity and yet all shaped in a way which gives to the\r\nspecial case an especially harmless appearance. He may even enter into\r\nexperimental proof that the patient is really accessible to\r\nautosuggestions. A very simple scheme for instance is to put some\r\ninteresting looking apparatus with a few metal rings on the fingers of\r\nthe subject and connect it with a battery and electric keys. The key is\r\nthen pushed down in view of the patient and he is to indicate the time\r\nwhen and the place where he begins to feel the galvanic current. The\r\nfeeling will come up probably very soon in the one or the other finger,\r\nand as soon as he feels sure that the sensation is present, the\r\nphysician can show him that there was no connection in the wires, that\r\nthe whole galvanic sensation was the result of suggestion.\r\n\r\nSuch a method demands patience and good will. The prejudices and\r\ndeeply-rooted hypochondriac ideas, foolish theories of the patient and\r\npessimistic emotions which have become habitual, must be removed piece\r\nby piece until the central symptoms themselves can be undermined and\r\nexplored. It often takes hours of careful and fatiguing reasoning, in\r\nwhich at any time the patient may suddenly slip back to his old ideas.\r\nYet if the explanatory arguments have once succeeded in making the\r\npatient himself believe firmly that his whole trouble resulted from\r\nsuggestion only, the inhibitory effect of this idea may be an excellent\r\none. The only serious defect of the method is that it often does not\r\nwork. The credit which neurologists of today give to its effectiveness\r\nseems to me much too high. Even slight neurasthenic and psychasthenic\r\ndisturbances remain too often in complete power when the patient is\r\nfully convinced that they originated with an emotional excitement which\r\nhas long since lost its feeling value or that it resulted from a chance\r\nsuggestion picked out from indifferent surroundings. The patient knows\r\nit and yet goes on suffering from the fruitless fight of his will\r\nagainst the intruder. Where mere reasoning is entirely successful, I am\r\ninclined to suspect that an element of suggestion has always been\r\nsuperadded. The authority of the physician has created a state of\r\nreënforced suggestibility in which the argument convinces, not by its\r\nlogic but by its impressiveness.\r\n\r\nThis element of suggestion is quite obvious when the argument takes the\r\nform of persuasion, a psychotherapeutic method which has found its\r\nindependent development. Whoever seeks to persuade relies on the mental\r\nfringe of his propositions. The idea is not to work by its own meaning\r\nbut by the manner of its presentation, by its impressiveness, by the\r\nauthority, by the warmth of the voice, by the sympathy which stands\r\nbehind it, by the attractiveness with which it is offered, by the\r\nadvantages which are in sight. Thus persuasion relies on personal powers\r\nto secure conviction where the logic of the argument is insufficient to\r\novercome contradictions. But just for that reason persuasion is after\r\nall only a special kind of suggestion.\r\n\r\nOther methods work on the same basis. Prominent among them is the\r\npsychotherapeutic effect of a formal assurance. The psychotherapist\r\nassures the patient that he will sleep the next night or that the pain\r\nwill disappear or that he will be able to walk with such firmness that\r\nthe counter-idea is undermined. It depends on the type of patient\r\nwhether such suggestions of belief work better when it is assured with\r\nan air of condescension, spoken with an authority which simply ignores\r\nevery possible contradiction, or with an air of sympathy and hope.\r\nExperience shows that it is favorable to connect such assurance with the\r\nentrance of a definite signal. \"You will sleep to-night when the clock\r\nstrikes ten,\" \"The pain will disappear when you enter the door of your\r\nhouse,\" or perhaps, \"Read this letter three times quietly in a low\r\nvoice, and at the end of the third reading your fear will suddenly\r\nstop.\" Psychological insight will further decide whether it is wiser in\r\nthe particular case to assure the patient of the resulting effect or\r\nrather of the power to bring about the effect. With some people, it\r\nworks better to insist that the result will happen, with others to\r\npromise that they themselves can secure it; in the one case they feel\r\nthemselves as passive instruments, in the other as real actors. To some\r\nhysterics, it is better to say: \"You will walk,\" to others, \"You can\r\nwalk.\"\r\n\r\nThis belief in the future entrance of a change frequently demands an\r\nartificial reënforcement. There belongs first the application of\r\nexternal factors which awaken in the background of the mind the\r\nsupporting idea that something has been changed in the whole situation\r\nor that some helpful influence has made the improvement possible.\r\nMedicines of colored and flavored water, applications of electric\r\ninstruments without currents, in extreme cases even the claptrap of a\r\nsham operation with a slight cut in the skin, may touch those brain\r\ncells which words alone cannot reach with sufficient energy and may thus\r\nsecure the desired psychophysical effect. The patient who by merely\r\nmental inhibition has lost his voice for weeks may get it back as soon\r\nas the physician has looked into his larynx with a mirror and has held\r\nan electrode without battery connection on the throat. Another way of\r\nhelping by make-believe methods is to give the impression that a decided\r\nimprovement is noticeable. The uneducated patient believes it easily\r\nwhen the physician at his very entrance into the office expresses his\r\nsurprise about the external symptoms of a change for the better, perhaps\r\nseen in the color of the skin or the shading of the iris in the eye and\r\nreaffirmed by some pseudotests of the muscle reflexes. All that is not\r\nvery edifying and the decent physician, who justly feels somewhat\r\ndragged down to the level of the quack in applying such means\r\nfrequently, will abstain from them wherever possible. He knows that in\r\nthe long run, even the psychasthenics are best treated with frankness\r\nand sincerity and he will therefore only in exceptional cases resort to\r\nsuch short-cut treatment by making believe. Yet that it is sometimes\r\nalmost the only way to help the patient cannot be denied.\r\n\r\nA neater way to secure the sufferer's belief in the possibility of a\r\ncure is by securing the desired effect at least once through little\r\ndevices. As soon as it is once reached, the patient knows that it can be\r\nreached and this knowledge works as a suggestion. The hysteric who\r\ncannot speak when he thinks of his words, or who cannot walk when he\r\nthinks of his legs, may by the skillful physician be brought to a few\r\nwords or steps before he himself is aware of it by completely turning\r\nhis attention to something else and producing the stimulus toward the\r\nmovement in a reflex-like way. Still more successful is the effort to\r\nresolve the inhibited action into its component parts and to show to the\r\npatient who cannot perform the action as a whole that he can go through\r\nthe parts of it after all. As soon as he has passed through a few times,\r\na new tactual-visual image of the whole complex is secured for his\r\nconsciousness and this image works then as a new cue for the entire\r\nvoluntary action, overcoming the associated counter-idea.\r\n\r\nAnother excellent way to overpower a troublesome idea or impulse or\r\nemotion is to reënforce the opposite idea by breaking open the paths for\r\nits motor expression. The effort to hold the counter-idea before\r\nconsciousness may be unsuccessful so long as it is only an idea which\r\ntries in vain to produce any motor effect; but if the action itself has\r\nbeen repeatedly gone through, the idea will find it easier to settle and\r\nit becomes vivid in proportion to the openness of the channels of motor\r\ndischarge. This holds true even for emotional states. A certain word\r\nperhaps picked up by the psychasthenic in a particular experience may\r\nproduce whenever it is seen a shock and a depressing emotion. If we ask\r\nthe patient to go artificially through the movements which express joy\r\nand hilarity, make him intentionally grin and open wide the eyes and\r\nexpand the arms and inhale deeply, and after training this movement\r\ncomplex of joyful expression, speak the dreaded word at the height of\r\nthe movement a new feeling combination clusters about the sound and may\r\novercome the antagonism. Sometimes you will give to the desirable idea\r\nsufficient strength by mere repetition, sometimes you force the\r\nattention better by unusual accentuation, connecting the suggestion with\r\na kind of shock. From here it is only one step to the suggestion in the\r\nform of a sharp order which breaks down the resistance just by its\r\nsuddenness and loudness, supported perhaps by a quick arm movement which\r\ngives a cue for imitative reflexes. In the case of a youngster even a\r\nslap may add to the nervous shock; also a sudden clapping of the hands\r\nmay favor effectiveness of the suggestive order.\r\n\r\nOften it is wise to give the suggestion, not from without but to\r\nprescribe it in the form of autosuggestions. For instance, advise the\r\npatient not only to have the good will and intention of suppressing a\r\ncertain fixed idea or by producing a certain inhibited impulse but to\r\nspeak to himself in an audible voice, every morning and every evening,\r\nsaying that he will overcome it now. Here, too, the autosuggestion may\r\nbecome effective by the frequency of the repetition or by the urgency of\r\nthe expression or by the accompanying motor reactions. As a matter of\r\ncourse any associations which reënforce the idea may be used for\r\nassistance. Especially near-lying is the appeal to the man's conscience,\r\nbut just such associations which touch the idea of the own personality\r\nand its deepest layers of feelings are always risky. They may touch and\r\nstir up old memories which interfere with success or they may awaken a\r\nfeeling of contrast between duty and fulfillment which may disturb the\r\nwhole equilibrium. If the physician knows that the good-will of the\r\npatient is insufficient to overcome the pathological disturbance, he\r\nought not to make him feel ashamed or guilty, and that not only for\r\nmoral reasons but also for strictly psychotherapeutic reasons.\r\n\r\nIn certain easily recognizable cases, it is essential to give the\r\nsuggestion with avoidance of any emphasis, only as a hint, passing as if\r\nthe suggestion almost slipped from the tongue of the doctor without his\r\nreal intention. The hysteric who is resisting the suggestion which is\r\nintentionally given to her is sometimes surprisingly trapped by a\r\nhalf-hidden suggestion, perhaps not spoken to the patient herself at all\r\nbut spoken in a low voice to a colleague in the room. Sometimes we have\r\nto trick those who suffer by \"negativism,\" that is by an obstinacy which\r\nexaggerates that of the ordinary stubborn man. In such cases the\r\nsuggestion not to perform an action works best if we want the action\r\nperformed. There is hardly an end to the list of such methods for\r\nbringing beliefs and attitudes with suggestive power to the mind of the\r\nsufferer. Definitely to describe the conditions under which the one or\r\nthe other form ought to be applied would be no wiser than to tell a\r\nstatesman what steps are to be taken in every possible diplomatic\r\nsituation. The instinctive selection of the right means among the many\r\npossible ones characterizes both the true statesman and the true doctor.\r\n\r\nSo far we have spoken only about the character of the suggestion,\r\npresupposing that the receiver remains in his natural state. This\r\npresupposition is certainly often entirely correct, but as far as it is\r\ncorrect, the results of the suggestion vary greatly with the different\r\nindividuals. On the whole, we might say that such suggestions given to\r\nthe subject in his normal state are effective only when the subject is\r\nby nature a suggestible being. In considering the psychology of\r\nsuggestion, we recognized at once that the degree of natural\r\nsuggestibility varies excessively. The non-suggestible mind is only to a\r\nslight degree influenced by any of these proposed forms of suggestion as\r\nlong as the suggestibility itself is not heightened. To be sure, the\r\nquestion whether the person is suggestible by nature or not cannot be\r\nsettled simply by his own impression. Many of the most suggestible\r\npersons believe firmly that they are superior to any suggestive\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nTo bring suggestions to greater effectiveness and to exert their\r\ninfluence practically upon every possible subject, we have thus not only\r\nto give suggestions or to advise autosuggestion but in both cases we\r\nhave to secure, especially for the naturally less suggestible patients,\r\na somewhat heightened suggestibility. Yet no one can overlook that some\r\nof the methods which we described have in themselves the tendency to\r\nreënforce the mental suggestibility. Those methods of emphasis and\r\norder, of assurance and make-believe, of practical training and of\r\nawakening counter-ideas, of persuasion and even of reasoning, wherever\r\nthey are in a high degree successful probably always gain a certain part\r\nof their success by the increased suggestibility which the whole\r\nsituation brings with it.\r\n\r\nThis reënforcement of the psychophysical readiness for suggestions\r\nresults indeed quite directly both from expectation of the unknown and\r\nof the half-way mysterious, and from the confidence in the doctor. Of\r\ncourse it can work very differently. The expectation can upset the\r\nnervous system and produce unrest instead of suggestibility and, instead\r\nof confidence, the patient may feel that discouraging diffidence which\r\nsettles easily upon those who have tried one fashionable physician after\r\nanother. But where there is real confidence, based perhaps on the fame\r\nof the doctor and on the reports of his powerful achievements, there the\r\nconditions for effective suggestions are greatly strengthened. Still\r\nbetter is it if this confidence in the man is combined with a sincere\r\nhope for recovery. To lie down on a lounge on which hundreds have been\r\ncured fascinates the imagination sufficiently to give to every\r\nsuggestion a much better chance to overcome the counter-idea. The\r\nexpectation that something wonderful will happen can even produce an\r\nalmost hypnoid state. The effect will be the greater, the less the\r\nbarriers of systematic knowledge hinder the entrance of suggested ideas.\r\nThe uneducated will on the whole offer less resistance to suggestions,\r\njust as superstitions find the freest play in the minds of the\r\nuntrained. It is not by chance that the earlier epidemics of\r\npathological suggestibility have on the whole disappeared with the\r\nbetter popular education. In a similar way work fatigue and exhaustion.\r\nThe resistance has grown weaker, the suggested idea goes automatically\r\ninto activity.\r\n\r\nSkillful artificial means can still surpass the effect of these natural\r\nconditions. Here belongs everything which accentuates the authority and\r\ndignity of the originator of the suggestion. The psychologically trained\r\nphysician has no difficulty in heightening the effect by simple\r\nsurprises, if he cares for such tricks. If the patient for whom a mental\r\ntreatment is recognized as necessary shows himself too skeptical to\r\nsubmit to the powers of the psychotherapist, such captivation of his\r\nbelief can easily be secured. Let the man perhaps fixate a penny on the\r\ntable with his right eye, while the left is closed and you show him that\r\nyou can make another penny suddenly disappear when you move it a certain\r\ndistance to the right and appear again when you move it still further.\r\nAs the man has never heard of the blind spot in the retina, he accredits\r\nyou with a special power. Many similar psychological illusions can well\r\nbe used to prepare the mind for unsuspected healing powers.\r\n\r\nStill stronger is the effect of personal contact. The psychophysiology\r\nof love indicates the most complex influence which contact sensations\r\nhave on the whole nervous system and especially on the vasomotor\r\napparatus of the body. Probably such vasomotor effect enters in,\r\nchanging the blood circulation in the brain, when a personal contact\r\nbetween the transmitter and receiver of the suggestion is brought about.\r\nIf the physician's hand rests quietly on the forehead of the patient who\r\nlies with closed eyes, or if he holds for a long while the hand of the\r\npatient, he may secure a nervous repose and submission which gives to\r\nthe suggestions the most fertile soil. Needless to say that here again\r\neverything depends upon the accessories. An unsympathetic doctor may be\r\nentirely powerless where his neighbor has complete success. Neither a\r\nlifeless hand nor an agitating one will bring the desired repose,\r\nneither a cold nor a rough one. There must be strength and energy and\r\neven discipline, and yet sympathy in the pressure of the fingers. Again\r\na psychologically different effect and yet one often to be preferred\r\nresults from mild stroking movements, the stroke always to be repeated\r\nin the same direction, never up and down. The slow change in the\r\nposition of the tactual sensations evidently produces a rather strong\r\ninfluence on the equilibrium of nervous impulses, and here again\r\nvasomotor reflexes seem to arise easily. Another variety of such bodily\r\ninfluences is given by artificial changes of the positions, for instance\r\nby bending the head of the subject backward while the eyes are closed.\r\nIt may be that a certain lack of balance sets in in which the\r\nself-equilibrium is disturbed and an external influence can thus more\r\neasily get control of the psychophysical system. Again a certain\r\nmonotony of speaking may easily add to the increase of the\r\nsuggestibility.\r\n\r\nEveryone knows that another most fruitful cause of this change is any\r\nmystic inspiration, any emotion in which the individual feels himself in\r\ncontact with something higher or larger or stronger. Of course, the\r\nchurch can secure this effect easily, and here again the maximum will be\r\nreached if a bodily contact with the symbol of religious exaltation can\r\nbe established. The patient who can touch the relics of the saints or\r\nbathe in the waters of Lourdes or at least feel on his forehead the hand\r\nof the minister, is wrought up to a state of suggestibility which makes\r\nsuggestions easily effective. The objective value of religion again has\r\nnothing to do with it, as exactly the same effect can result from the\r\nmost barbarous superstition. The amulets of a gypsy might secure the\r\nsame resetting of the psychophysical system which the most sacred\r\nsymbols awaken, and even many an educated person is unable to cross the\r\nthreshold of a palmist or an astrologist, or to attend the performance\r\nof a spiritist, or to sit down with a purchasable trance medium without\r\nfeeling an uncanny mental state which is objectively characterized by an\r\nincreased suggestibility. But finally, the same effect sets in when the\r\nsymbols of other emotional spheres are applied, perhaps for the\r\npatriotic soldier the flag of his country.\r\n\r\nAll the states of increased suggestibility which we have characterized\r\nso far still remain within the limit of normal wakefulness. We may turn\r\nnow to the methods of the psychotherapist which produce in the interest\r\nof the suggestions an artificial state. However we have no right\r\nsuperficially to claim that the effectiveness of the suggestions is\r\nalways greater in such unnatural states. On the contrary, we know that\r\nsometimes well applied suggestions work on wide-awake persons with\r\nincreased suggestibility more strongly than on hypnotized subjects. Here\r\neven the instinct of the experienced physician may easily go astray, and\r\nit may need practical tests to find out which way will be the most\r\naccessible to the particular case. Often a certain rôle belongs even to\r\nnatural sleep. It cannot be denied that some people can be influenced to\r\nsome degree by words spoken to them during sleep. Most adults either\r\nwake up or show no signs of influence beyond effects on their dreams.\r\nBut some absorb especially whispered words in such a way that their\r\npower becomes evident after the waking of the sleeper. Much more is this\r\ntrue of children. A suggestion to give up vicious habits, perhaps in the\r\nsexual sphere, or to speak fluently and no longer stammer may thus be\r\nbeneficial. Yet the danger of this method is not small and extensive use\r\nof it is certainly not advisable. The more easily it can be carried into\r\nevery bedchamber and can thus give to every mother and nurse the tools\r\nof a rather powerful therapy, the more a danger signal ought to be\r\ndisplayed. Interference with the natural sleep by outer influences\r\ncreates abnormal conditions which cannot be removed at will. The chances\r\nare great that many unintended bad effects slip in and that not a few\r\nhysterias may be created by a method at the first glance so startling.\r\nMuch less objectionable is it to make use of the effect of that period\r\nof half-sleep which precedes the natural sleep, and which is for many a\r\nperiod of increased suggestibility for autosuggestions. A resolution or\r\nthe formulation of a belief which would be ineffective in a wide-awake\r\nstate seems to get an accentuated effect on the mind, if it is\r\nrepeatedly expressed in this transitional state. The psychasthenic who\r\nin such a half-dozing stage assures himself that he will no longer be\r\nafraid of going over a bridge or hearing a thunderstorm or will feel a\r\ndisgust for whiskey or will have the energy for work, has a certain\r\nchance that such autosuggestions become reality the next morning. With\r\nmany others there seems no effect to be obtained and not a few seem\r\nunable to catch the right moment. As soon as they begin to speak they\r\nbecome wide awake or fall asleep before they talk.\r\n\r\nIncomparably more value belongs to the artificial sleep, the mesmeric\r\nstate of earlier days, the hypnotism of our time. We have discussed its\r\ntheory and recognized that an abnormally increased suggestibility is\r\nindeed its chief feature. We know hypnotism in most various degrees; the\r\nlowest can be reached practically by everyone, the highest by rather\r\nfew. It is almost arbitrary to decide where those waking states with\r\nhigh tension of suggestibility end and the hypnotic states begin, and\r\nnot less arbitrary to call the higher degrees only hypnotism and to\r\ndesignate the lower degrees as hypnoid states. If we do it, we certainly\r\nshould acknowledge from the start that the hypnoid states are for\r\ntherapeutic purposes not a bit less important than the full hypnotic\r\nstates. Certainly the hypnoid states do not allow complex hallucinations\r\nand absurd post-hypnotic actions, but they offer excellent starting\r\npoints for the removal of light obsessions and phobias and for the\r\nreënforcement of desirable impulses, volitions, and emotions. Many\r\npersons cannot under any circumstances be brought beyond such a hypnoid\r\ndegree. The physician who has not theoretical experiments but practical\r\nsuccess in view ought therefore never to trouble himself with the\r\ninquiry exactly which degree has been reached. This advice is given\r\nbecause nothing interferes with the progress of hypnotic influence so\r\nbadly as the constant testing. It must naturally often lead to a point\r\nwhere the subject finds that he can very well still do what the\r\nhypnotizer told him not to do. If the doctor assures him that he can no\r\nlonger move his arm and the patient is yet able to move it, the doctor\r\nsecures the very superfluous knowledge that this special degree of\r\nsuggestibility has not been reached, but the patient is sliding backward\r\nand the lower degree which actually had been reached will be less\r\naccessible later. The physician might rather resort to the opposite\r\ncourse and assure the patient, even after the first treatment which\r\nmight have been a slight success, that he saw from definite symptoms\r\nthat hypnosis had set in. That will greatly smooth the way for real\r\nhypnotic effects the next time.\r\n\r\nThe best method of hypnotizing is the one which relies essentially on\r\nthe spoken word, awakening through speech the idea of the approach of\r\nsleep. If the hypnotizer assures the subject in monotonous words that a\r\nfeeling of fatigue is setting in, that he is feeling a tiredness\r\ncreeping over his shoulders and arms and legs, that his memories are\r\nfading away and that he is now hypnotized, for not a few all is done\r\nthat is needed. The hypnotic state will come and will hold until the\r\nverbal suggestion takes it off again. Perhaps the hypnotizer says that\r\nhe will count three and at three the subject is to open his eyes and\r\nfeel perfectly comfortable. It is wise to tell the patient beforehand\r\nthat he will not lose consciousness and that he will remember afterward\r\nwhatever happens as many people believe that loss of memory belongs to\r\nthe hypnotic state, and that they were not hypnotized if they can\r\nremember what happened. Such a skeptical after-attitude can seriously\r\ninterfere with the success of the treatment.\r\n\r\nYet in most cases, it will be safer not to rely on words only but to\r\nsupplement them by manipulations which all converge towards the effect\r\nof increasing the suggestibility and thus of overcoming the resistance\r\nto the suggestions introduced. It is well known that for this purpose it\r\nis advisable to begin the influence with some slight fatiguing\r\nstimulations. The effect is most easily reached when the patient fixates\r\nperhaps a shining button held over his eyes or listens to monotonous\r\nsounds. A particularly strong effect belongs again to very slight touch\r\nstimuli. If the subject with his eyes closed is touched perhaps by two\r\npencils at various and unexpected points of the face and hands, a\r\nskillful playing on his tactual senses soon produces a half-dozing state\r\nof hypnoid character. In the same group belong those so-called passes\r\nwhich evidently have a reflex influence in the blood-vessel system. It\r\nis advisable to combine the various elements in such a way that at first\r\nphysical stimuli upon eye or skin produce an over-suggestible state and\r\nthat only as soon as this state is reached the verbal suggestion sets\r\nin, perhaps with the words, \"I shall hypnotize you now.\" Under such\r\nconditions every subject may soon be brought to that degree of\r\nhypnotization which is accessible to him. Yet more than one treatment is\r\nusually necessary for the higher degrees. Much less importance for\r\ntherapeutic purposes belongs to that hypnoid state which is reached\r\nwithout the idea of sleep where the subject comes with open eyes into a\r\nkind of fascination, produced perhaps by a sudden flash of light or by\r\nthe firm eye of the hypnotizer. It is a state which can lead to a strong\r\nsubmission of will and which has its legal importance. Therapeutically\r\nit can hardly secure an effect which cannot better be secured through\r\nthe real sleeplike hypnotism. Under certain conditions, chemical\r\nsubstances may well prepare for the hypnotic treatment, for instance\r\nbromides or alcohol. Others rely on the suggestive effect of flavored\r\nwater. But all that is unwise. The confidence of the patient is the best\r\npreparation for the securing of the helpful degree of hypnotism.\r\n\r\nOf course only a small part of the therapeutic usefulness is secured\r\nduring the hypnotic state itself. A pain may be removed, sleep be\r\nsecured, an idea be inhibited, a movement be reënforced in cases where\r\nnon-hypnotic suggestions would have found insurmountable obstacles.\r\nDuring the hypnosis we may also open the storehouse of memory and bring\r\nto light the ideas which disturbed the equilibrium of the suffering\r\nmind. Further in those most complex hysteric cases of dissociated\r\npersonality, new memory connections may be formed during the hypnosis\r\nby which a synthesis of the double or triple personalities into the old\r\none may be secured. Yet the general effect which the physician has to\r\nhope for from hypnotic treatment is the post-hypnotic one. Not what\r\nhappens during the hypnosis but what the suggestion will produce after\r\nhypnosis is essential to him. The fixed idea is to disappear forever,\r\nthe paralyzed limb is under control, the desire for morphine and cocaine\r\nis gone for all future time, the perverse longing is annihilated, the\r\nold energy is to remain again for all time. It is the post-hypnotic\r\nafter-effectiveness which gives to the hypnoid and to the hypnotic\r\nstates their importance for the treatment of the most exasperating\r\nsymptoms. To be sure, the treatment often must be a prolonged one. A man\r\nwho for years has used thirty grains of morphine a day cannot be rid of\r\nthe desire after two or three hypnotic sittings. In such a case the\r\ntreatment may cover three or four months, if it is to be of lasting\r\nvalue and without any damage during the treatment.\r\n\r\nStill we are not at the end of the psychotherapeutic methods and we may\r\nturn to a fascinating group of curative efforts which has especially\r\ncome to the foreground in recent years. We mentioned before that\r\nmischief cannot seldom be traced back to earlier experiences with a\r\nstrong unpleasurable feeling. In certain cases, the subject remembers\r\nsuch particular experiences as the beginning of his discomfort; in\r\nothers, especially those of hysteric character, the starting point may\r\nhave long been forgotten, and yet that early impression evidently left\r\ntraces in the brain which produce disturbances in conscious life. The\r\npsychotherapist nowadays calls these groups of traces \"complexes.\" We\r\nrecognized clearly that there is no reason to refer such forgotten\r\nremainders of the past to any subconscious mind; they are physical\r\nafter-effects which keep their influence over the equilibrium of the\r\npsychophysical system. Now modern psychotherapy finds that the entire\r\ndisturbances which arise from such emotional disagreeable experiences,\r\nforgotten or not forgotten, can often be removed by psychical means. Two\r\nways in particular seem open. As soon as the idea is fully brought back\r\nto consciousness again, the patient must be made to express the primary\r\nemotion with full intensity. Subtle analysis has repeatedly shown that\r\nmany of the gravest hysteric symptoms result from such a suppression of\r\nemotions at the beginning and disappear as soon as the primary\r\nexperience comes to its right motor discharge and gains its normal\r\noutlet in action. The whole irritation becomes eliminated, the emotion\r\nis relieved from suppression and the source of the cortical uproar is\r\nremoved forever.\r\n\r\nPractically still more important seems the other case which refers alike\r\nto hysterics and psychasthenics and which is applicable for the\r\nforgotten experience not less than for the well-remembered ones. This\r\nsecond way demands that the psychotherapist bring this primary\r\nexperience strongly to consciousness and then by a new training link it\r\nwith new and more desirable associations and reactions. The disturbing\r\nidea is thus not to be discharged but to be sidetracked so that in\r\nfuture it leads to harmless results. The new setting works towards an\r\nentirely new equilibrium. What was a starting point for abnormal fears\r\nnow becomes an indifferent object of interest and all its evil\r\nconsequences are cut off. It may be acknowledged that the full\r\nelaboration of these methods still belongs to the future. Both methods,\r\nthe discharging, or the so-called cathartic one, and the side-tracking\r\nmethod evidently demand the discovery of the starting point in the\r\nservice of the therapy and here again several methods are at the\r\ndisposal of the psychologist.\r\n\r\nA promising way to this end is the inexhaustible association test which\r\nwe mentioned when we discussed the contributions of the psychological\r\nlaboratory to the medical diagnosis. A series of short words are spoken\r\nto the patient and, as soon as he hears one, he is to pronounce as\r\nquickly as possible the first word which comes to his mind. If we use\r\nfifty words, we should be able to learn something as to the inner states\r\nof the man and as to the working of his mind, if we analyze carefully\r\nhis particular choices. But two further conditions ought to be\r\nfulfilled. The time of the association ought to be measured. Of course\r\nthere will be wide differences. A word which is often in a certain\r\nconnection will quickly bring the habitual association. Abstract words\r\nwill call forth their associations more slowly than concrete words,\r\nfamiliar words more rapidly than unfamiliar words. To measure such\r\nassociation time with fullest accuracy, as it is necessary for the\r\npurpose of scientific investigations, delicate electrical instruments\r\nare needed that indicate thousandths parts of a second. For the purpose\r\nof the practical physician such accuracy would be superfluous. His\r\nexamination will be perfectly successful if it is carefully done with a\r\nstop-watch which shows the fifth part of a second, like those which are\r\nused at races. He speaks a word, presses at the same time the button of\r\nthe watch, and presses the stopper when he sees the lips of the patient\r\nmoving. He is thus able to examine not only the involuntary choice of\r\nassociation but also the time of every associative process. But a second\r\ncondition ought also to be fulfilled. After some indifferent words,\r\nothers ought to be mixed into the series which touch in a tentative way\r\non various spheres corresponding to the possible suspicions. The groups\r\nto which the hidden thoughts of psychasthenics, for instance, belong are\r\nnot many. As soon as our series of words strikes such a group, the\r\nreaction of the mind may be discriminated. The effect may be a general\r\nperturbation resulting either in an unusual delay of the fitting\r\nassociation or in an effort to cover the sore spot by an unfitting\r\nassociation. Sometimes the dangerous association may rush forward even\r\nwith unusual rapidity but, as soon as it is uttered, it gives a shock to\r\nthe mental system, brings the whole associative process into disorder,\r\nand the result is that the next following associations are abnormally\r\ndelayed. The skilled psychologist will quickly take such a change as a\r\ncue for the selection of the later words in his series. Of course, he\r\nwill at first return to neutral words, but as soon as he has found a\r\ndanger spot, he will approach it from various sides, perhaps in every\r\nfourth or fifth word, and may then find out which particular experiences\r\nare disquieting the patient. Words like women or money or career or\r\nfamily or disease are often sufficient to get the first inkling of a\r\nmental story.\r\n\r\nWith less diagnostic elegance we sometimes reach the same end by taking\r\ncareful records of pulse and breathing and involuntary movements during\r\nan apparently harmless conversation. The instruments at the disposal of\r\nthe psychologist are those familiar to every psychological laboratory:\r\nthe pneumograph, which registers the movements of respiration; the\r\nsphygmograph, which writes the pulsation of the artery in the wrist; the\r\nautomatograph, or other instruments, which register the slight\r\nunintentional movements of the arm. If the examiner is skillful, he will\r\nnot fail to discover the changes in breathing and pulse and reaction as\r\nsoon as the painful groups of ideas are approached. More of theoretic\r\ninterest and too cumbersome for practical diagnosis is the unfailing\r\ngalvanic reaction from the skin in which the glands change their\r\nactivity and their resistance to the galvanic current under the\r\ninfluence of hidden emotions. Yet all these methods, with exception of\r\nthe last, are essentially useful only if the starting experience is\r\nstill accessible to the memory of the patient. He may be unaware that it\r\nhad anything to do with his nervous symptoms but he recognizes the\r\nexperience still as soon as his attention is directed towards it. The\r\npsychologically more interesting but probably more exceptional situation\r\nis the one in which it is not only forgotten but cannot be recognized\r\nwhen it is brought to consciousness. The shortest way to get hold of\r\nsuch past impressions is the hypnotic one. The hypnotic state sharpens\r\nthe memory and experiences of early childhood or apparently\r\ninsignificant experiences of later life may be brought back when they\r\nwould have been inaccessible to any intentional effort of the attention.\r\nEven still more surprising is the success if the association is left to\r\na dreamy play of ideas suggested perhaps by gazing into a crystal ball\r\nor by a meaningless talking. Perhaps the patient lies with closed eyes\r\non the couch while the physician holds his hand. A few words are given\r\nto him as a starting point and then he is thoughtlessly to pronounce\r\nwhatever comes to his mind, not only unfinished sentences but loose\r\nphrases, single words, apparently without meaning and slowly ideas arise\r\nwhich betray the original intrusion. At last memories and lost emotions\r\ncome again to the surface, and the watchful psychotherapist may discover\r\nthe complex, which is then to be removed by discharge or by\r\nside-tracking. This is the so-called psychoanalytic method.\r\n\r\nFinally the psychotherapist may go still one step further. After all it\r\noften seems inexplainable that just this or that emotional experience\r\nmade such a deep and lasting impression while a thousand other\r\nexperiences passed by without leaving any mischievous after-effect. It\r\nseems that indeed the conditions are still more complicated. That\r\nemotional disturbance operated dangerously perhaps only because it\r\nitself appealed to a suppressed desire and this seems to hold true\r\nespecially for suppressed emotions of the sexual sphere. The desire for\r\ngratification in normal or abnormal channels was perhaps attached by the\r\nmind to some group of objects. It was completely suppressed but it left\r\nan abnormal tension in the central system. If now a chance experience\r\ntouches on this group of ideas, there results an explosive reaction; and\r\nmovements, convulsions, spasms, obsessions, and fears set in which get\r\ntheir particular character not through the secondary intrusion but from\r\nthe primary desire. To discharge that intrusion leads therefore only to\r\nthe elimination of those symptoms which resulted from it, but the\r\nprimary disturbance goes on and any new chance intrusion will produce\r\nnew explosions. The psychotherapist should therefore go deeper and\r\nrelieve the mind from those primary desires which may belong to early\r\nyouth and which are entirely forgotten. Even the method of automatic\r\nwriting may here sometimes lead to an unveiling of those deepest layers\r\nof suppressed desires. In the same way a careful, subtle analysis of\r\ndreams may support the search for the hidden source of interference.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of the technical methods of the psychotherapist. It would\r\nbe short-sighted to ignore the great manifoldness of secondary methods\r\nwhich he shares with the ordinary intercourse between man and man, the\r\nmethods which the teacher uses in the schoolroom, which the parents use\r\nin the nursery, which the neighbor uses with his neighbor, methods which\r\nbuild up the mind, methods which train the mind, methods which reënforce\r\ngood habits and suppress unwholesome ones, methods which stimulate sound\r\nemotions and inhibit a quarrelsome temper, methods which indeed are not\r\nless important in the psychiatric clinic and in the hospital than in our\r\ndaily life, and which certainly have central importance in that\r\nborderland region which is the particular working field of the\r\npsychotherapist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nTHE MENTAL SYMPTOMS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have discussed both the psychological theory and the practical work\r\nof psychotherapy in a systematic order without any reference to personal\r\nchance experience. After studying the fundamental principles, we have\r\nsketched the whole field of disturbances in which psychotherapeutic\r\ninfluence might be possible and all the methods available. It seems\r\nnatural that our next step should be an illustrating of such work by a\r\nnumber of typical cases. Here it seems advisable to leave the track of\r\nan objective system and to turn to the record of personal observation.\r\nAs this is not a handbook for the physician, dealing with the special\r\nforms of disease, we emphasized before that we avoid even any attempt in\r\nsuch a direction because it would have to introduce not only the\r\nquestions of diagnosis, but above all the highly important questions of\r\ntreatment by physical agencies. We saw that for us nothing else can be\r\ndesirable, but to show the way in which the various symptoms which\r\nsuggest mental treatment occur, and how they yield to the psychical\r\nmethods. We had also agreed beforehand that for a first survey we might\r\nseparate the mental from the bodily symptoms and group the mental ones\r\nwith reference to the predominance of ideational, emotional, and\r\nvolitional factors. And finally it may be said that we abstain from\r\neverything which is exceptional or even unusual, and confine ourselves\r\nto the routine observations with which the psychotherapist comes in\r\ncontact every day and the simplest country physician surely every week.\r\n\r\nThus I turn from systematic objectivity to my unsystematic reminiscences\r\nof many years. Of course, they abound with eccentric abnormities and\r\nstartling phenomena. As I have devoted myself to psychotherapeutics,\r\nalways and only from scientific interest, as a part of my laboratory\r\nstudies and therefore have refused to spend any time on cases which\r\noffered no special psychological interest to me, the striking and\r\nsensational cases have prevailed in my practice even to an unusual\r\ndegree. Yet they are unessential for our purposes here, the more as\r\ntheir interest lies mostly in the complex structure of the mental state\r\nwhile the curative features are in the background. Our purpose of\r\ndemonstrating practical cases as they occur in every village, and as\r\nthey ought to be understood and treated by every doctor, thus rules out\r\njust those experiences which would be prominent in a theoretical study\r\nof abnormal psychology. We want to select only simple commonplace cases.\r\nOnly those who have not learned to see are unaware that such cases are\r\neverywhere about them.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, I also leave out everything which refers to\r\ninsanity, that is, every mental disturbance which lies essentially\r\noutside of the domain of psychotherapy. The helpful influence which\r\npsychical factors can exert in the asylums for the insane is, as we\r\nemphasized, entirely secondary. The psychotherapeutic methods in the\r\nnarrower sense of the word are in the present state of our knowledge\r\nineffective in the insane asylum. I should also be unable to speak of\r\nlaboratory experience with insanity, as I insist on sanitarium treatment\r\nin every such case. The question of how to differentiate the diagnosis\r\nof insanity from that of the other mental abnormities is not our\r\nquestion at this moment. I select the few illustrations which seem to me\r\ndesirable for the purpose of making more concrete our abstract\r\ndiscussion of methods, essentially from the class of neurasthenics,\r\npsychasthenics, hysterics, and so on.\r\n\r\nIn all these reports, I shall confine the account to the few points\r\nwhich are to illustrate the psychical factors, thus abstaining entirely\r\nfrom the further details which any medical history of the cases would\r\ndemand and from all results of further examination and other\r\nparticulars. As a matter of course, I exclude the possibility of\r\nidentifying the patient. I may start with a typical case of obsessing\r\nideas of simplest character and with simple routine treatment\r\nillustrating the emphasis on antagonistic ideas.\r\n\r\n     A man of mature age, well educated, well built and in every respect\r\n     in good health, without nervous history and without other nervous\r\n     symptoms, suffered vehemently by the persistent recurrence of a\r\n     visual image which entirely absorbed his attention. He knew\r\n     exactly the development of his trouble. A woman acquaintance of his\r\n     had committed suicide by poisoning herself. He knew her slightly\r\n     and the emotion of personal loss played hardly any rôle in the\r\n     case. But he had met her at a gay dinner a short time before her\r\n     death. The news of the suicide came to him when he was overtired\r\n     from work. The idea of the contrast between seeing his friend\r\n     partaking of the dinner and imagining her drinking the poison gave\r\n     him a strong shock. There was hardly any grief mixed in. He\r\n     remembers that he shivered at the thought of the contrast, and in\r\n     that moment the visual image of the woman raising a glass of poison\r\n     to her mouth flashed into his mind and thus became almost a part of\r\n     the shock. From that time on, the memory image of this scene\r\n     returned more and more frequently. At first it associated itself\r\n     with any chance mentioning of death or suicide and to a very slight\r\n     degree with the idea of a meal. More and more any element of a meal\r\n     and of social life, the word soup or meat, the word gown or dance,\r\n     brought up at once the picture of the woman, which had in the\r\n     meantime lost every element of personal relation. Any sad thought\r\n     of her ending had faded away. It remained merely a troublesome\r\n     impression. The man fought against it by trying to suppress the\r\n     idea but the more he fought against it, the more insistently it\r\n     rushed forward through new and ever new association paths. Any\r\n     advertisement in the newspaper referring to food, anything in a\r\n     shop window referring to ladies' dresses, any household utensils\r\n     related to a meal, and especially the meals themselves, forced the\r\n     visual image into the centre and captured the attention to such a\r\n     degree that a confusing distraction from the real surroundings\r\n     resulted. The struggle against the idea became more and more\r\n     exasperating, made life a torture, almost suggested despair, even\r\n     faint thoughts of suicide, and especially a growing fear that it\r\n     was a symptom of the beginning of insanity.\r\n\r\n     When he came to me, a number of physical cures, especially bromides\r\n     and electricity, had been tried in vain by the physician. Some\r\n     weeks in the country had not changed the distress. He came to me\r\n     with the direct request as a last resort to try hypnotic treatment.\r\n     I found in spite of the fact that he and his physician had\r\n     constantly spoken of visual hallucinations that the visual image\r\n     had no hallucinatory character at all, that is, he never believed\r\n     that he saw the image of that woman as if it were actually present,\r\n     he never took the product of his imagination for reality, nor had\r\n     it the vividness and character of reality. It was hardly more vivid\r\n     than any landscape which he tried to remember, only that it\r\n     controlled the interplay of ideas in such a persistent way. I found\r\n     that he was a strong visualizer and easily suggestible. I told him\r\n     beforehand that I should hypnotize him only to a slight degree,\r\n     that he would not lose consciousness, that he would remember\r\n     everything which I told him. Then I asked him to lie down and had\r\n     him gaze on a crystal only for half a minute, then close the eyes.\r\n     I asked him to relax and to think of sleep. With the two blunt\r\n     points of a compass, I touched his two cheeks at corresponding\r\n     places, then his forehead. And now I told him that I would begin\r\n     with the hypnotic influence. I put my hand on his forehead and\r\n     spoke to him in a monotonous way, saying that he felt a fatigue in\r\n     his shoulders, and in his arms, creeping over his whole body and\r\n     assured him that he was now fully hypnotized. To what degree he\r\n     really was hypnotized cannot be said as no effort was made to test\r\n     it by any experiments, thus avoiding any possible reaction against\r\n     the feeling of submission. Expression and breathing indicated a\r\n     slight hypnoid state. Then I removed my hand and spoke to him in a\r\n     warm and assuring way.\r\n\r\n     I told him that in future he would give his full attention to his\r\n     meal, and not give the slightest attention to any image of his\r\n     friend. If he should think of the friend the memory would appear\r\n     indifferent, he would not even notice the image and would give his\r\n     whole mind to the objects with which he was engaged. In the same\r\n     way, when he should be reading newspapers or looking in\r\n     shopwindows, his whole attention would belong to that which he\r\n     really perceived. Any passing inner image would be ignored. Then I\r\n     awoke him from his sleep. He was unwilling to believe that he had\r\n     been in hypnosis at all. I told him that the effect would prove it\r\n     and in his fully wakeful state I explained to him why there was not\r\n     the slightest fear of insanity justified, that it was a\r\n     psychasthenic state resulting from fatigue and shock and from a\r\n     wrong attitude of his attention during the past months, and then I\r\n     asked him to return the next day. Intentionally I had not given the\r\n     suggestion that the image would disappear. I could not expect it\r\n     would disappear entirely after a first treatment and even a faint\r\n     appearance of it would have at once fascinated the attention and\r\n     brought about the whole disturbance of the equilibrium which might\r\n     become habitual. Instead of it I gave the impulse to the\r\n     counter-idea, that is, I reënforced the attention towards that\r\n     which he really saw around him and thus withdrew the attention from\r\n     the rival image in the mind. The success was complete. He came the\r\n     next day in a much happier frame of mind, reporting that he still\r\n     had seen the image of the woman every few minutes, especially\r\n     strongly at the breakfast table, but it had no longer troubled him.\r\n     It was more in the background of consciousness, sometimes it\r\n     appeared transparent, it no longer held his attention, and he felt\r\n     free to give his full attention to the actual surroundings.\r\n\r\n     On that basis I hypnotized him the second day and he had hardly\r\n     heard me saying that he ought to try to sleep when he was evidently\r\n     in a much deeper hypnotic state than the first time. Again I\r\n     suggested only the opposite attitude, the positive turning to the\r\n     surroundings and the complete neglect and indifference for the\r\n     possible memory image. This time the effect was still stronger. On\r\n     the third day he reported that he still saw the image but he no\r\n     longer minded it, as it was like a veil through which he looked at\r\n     real objects and that left him entirely indifferent. His mind was\r\n     hardly engaged with it any more. The real spell of the attention\r\n     was broken. On the basis of this situation, I took the last step\r\n     and suggested that the image of the woman would disappear\r\n     altogether and would not trouble him any more. In the next\r\n     twenty-four hours, it still returned two or three times, but\r\n     colorless and faint. The following day I was able to eliminate it\r\n     altogether. Even when the last trace of the inner struggle between\r\n     the memory and the perceived surroundings had disappeared, I went\r\n     on with two hypnotic sittings to give stability to the new\r\n     equilibrium, to insist that the image would not come back and to\r\n     settle completely that inner repose with which every fear of\r\n     possible disease evaporated. I feel sure that the cure would not\r\n     have been reached so quickly, possibly not at all, if the second\r\n     suggestion, the disappearance of the image, had been given at the\r\n     first step. The improvement was secured because the antagonistic\r\n     process itself was used for the suggestion. On the other hand,\r\n     there was no doubt that in this case the strong will of the patient\r\n     or suggestion in a normal state would not alone have been\r\n     sufficient. The hypnotic treatment was indicated by the symptoms\r\n     and justified by the results.\r\n\r\nI may take another typical case in which also the obsession was brought\r\nabout by an idea without emotional value or at least by an idea which\r\nhad lost its emotional character; the idea came somewhat nearer to\r\nhallucination, but had its chief elements on tactual ground where the\r\ntransition from image to hallucinatory perception is easier. I add this\r\ncase to demonstrate that hypnosis is not the only open way of treatment\r\nin such cases and that the variations must always be adjusted to the\r\nspecial conditions. The case gains importance by the fact that the\r\npatient was himself a physician well trained in mental observation.\r\n\r\n     The patient is a highly educated physician of middle age. He\r\n     reports that he had been neurasthenic all his life with slight\r\n     ever-changing symptoms. He has always been troubled by the\r\n     \"perseveration\" of tactual images which had a strong feeling tone\r\n     and which were associated with seen or heard reports of the\r\n     experiences of others. For instance, when he read in a newspaper\r\n     that someone had hurt his hand with a pin, or that someone had cut\r\n     his foot on a nail, he immediately felt a not directly painful but\r\n     uncomfortable sensation at the particular place in the hand or in\r\n     the foot, together with a shrinking of the whole body and such\r\n     tactual sensation usually returned during the following days in\r\n     fainter and fainter form until it faded away. Most troublesome had\r\n     always been the reading of any torture processes in historical\r\n     books or in fiction. Yet there had never been a case in which the\r\n     sensations really had the vividness of hallucinations and never a\r\n     case in which the after effects had not disappeared at least in a\r\n     few weeks.\r\n\r\n     This time the effect had already lasted four months and it became\r\n     more and more troublesome. The patient had not the slightest fear\r\n     of mental disease and no anxiety, but he felt a very serious\r\n     disturbance by the instinctive effort to get rid of the intrusion.\r\n     The place of the disturbance was the wrists. The starting point was\r\n     a definite experience. On an unusually hot summer day the physician\r\n     had listened for a long time to the complaints of a female patient\r\n     who suffered vehemently from a nervous fear of scissors and knives\r\n     and who was afraid that she would cut her artery at the wrist. He\r\n     believes that it was the exhausting heat of the day which weakened\r\n     him to a point where the story of his patient affected him very\r\n     strongly and made him think of it all the time. Yet there was no\r\n     sensation element involved. A few hours later, he sat in a hotel at\r\n     his dinner. Just in front of him a butler started to carve a duck\r\n     with a long, sharp knife. In that moment he felt as if the knife\r\n     passed through the wrists of both arms. He felt for a moment almost\r\n     faint; arms and legs were contracted and an almost painful\r\n     sensation lingered in the skin, and did not disappear for hours.\r\n\r\n     From that day at the sight of knives or razors, not only in his\r\n     hands or his direct neighborhood, but also in a store and finally\r\n     in a picture, stirred up at once the optical image of that carving\r\n     knife cutting into the skin of the wrist, only with the difference\r\n     that it seldom was found in both arms, usually in the one or the\r\n     other. The sensation became a strictly tactual one with optical\r\n     overtone, but there was no emotion in it. The pain element had\r\n     disappeared. Also the shock, which still recurred in the first days\r\n     slowly disappeared. The longer the symptom lasted, the more the\r\n     optical factor faded away, and the tactual factor came into the\r\n     foreground after three or four weeks. Perhaps seeing a razor in a\r\n     store window or a pocket knife open no longer stirred up the image\r\n     of cutting the wrist, but simply a strong tactual sensation, as if\r\n     the skin of the wrist was scratched and pinched. Finally, after\r\n     about two months, the association character disappeared to a high\r\n     degree and the scratching and cutting sensation in the skin became\r\n     independent and automatic. The patient awoke in the morning with a\r\n     vivid tactual hallucination of being cut without associating with\r\n     it any picture of a knife. Throughout the day, in the midst of work\r\n     and in the midst of conversation, sometimes one and sometimes the\r\n     other wrist became the center of the exasperating sensation, easily\r\n     bringing with it involuntary reactions as if to withdraw the arm.\r\n     This became more and more frequent and more and more vivid.\r\n\r\n     The doctor, fully aware of the borderland character of this\r\n     experience, felt sure that his inner fight against the disturbance\r\n     would get control of it. The usual tonics did not show any\r\n     influence. On the other hand, there were no other nervous symptoms\r\n     and, with his most acute analysis, he did not find the slightest\r\n     trace of emotion any longer. When the symptoms reached a point at\r\n     which they seriously interfered with his comfort, he asked me for\r\n     psychotherapeutic treatment, under the condition that I was not to\r\n     apply hypnotism. He was absolutely averse to the use of hypnotism\r\n     in his own case because he was afraid that to be hypnotized would\r\n     mean for him a certain disposition to fall into hypnotic sleep by\r\n     auto-suggestion, as he knew the vividness of his imaginative\r\n     sensations. He wanted to avoid that the more as his own\r\n     professional work might sometimes demand hypnotizing in his own\r\n     practice. In any case he had an aversion to it and asked for other\r\n     means.\r\n\r\n     Under these circumstances, it seemed to me the most logical\r\n     conclusion that the counter idea with its antagonistic reactions\r\n     might be reënforced by direct perception. The abnormal tactual\r\n     sensation forced on consciousness the idea of the cutting of the\r\n     wrist. The necessary counter action would be to force to\r\n     consciousness the idea of the uninjured wrist and the corresponding\r\n     reactions. As the wrist can be easily made accessible to sight and\r\n     as I anticipated that the visual sensations would be more forceful\r\n     than the tactual ones, I told him to look straight at his own\r\n     wrists for ten minutes three times a day after waking, after\r\n     luncheon, and before going to bed. He had to hold his two forearms\r\n     close in front of his eyes and stare at them, giving his full\r\n     attention to the visual impression of the smooth, uninjured skin of\r\n     the wrist. If during this process, the tactual counter-sensations\r\n     were vivid, he had to go on with the staring at both arms, both\r\n     held near together until the perception had crowded out the rival\r\n     touch sensation. When this performance had been carried out six\r\n     times, he did not notice the coming up of the tactual sensation\r\n     with vividness any longer. From the third day it had disappeared\r\n     entirely. I told him to go on with the process still every morning\r\n     for some weeks. The physician himself considered the cure as\r\n     complete.\r\n\r\nOur first case dealt with hypnosis, our second case removed the\r\nintruding idea by a perception in a waking state. To point at once to\r\nthe variety of methods which we sketched, we may turn again to a case of\r\nemotionless idea removed by the method of switching off and\r\nside-tracking the originating and physiological \"complex.\"\r\n\r\n     The patient is a school-teacher in the Middle West, a nervous,\r\n     thin-looking woman of about twenty-five. Her only complaint is a\r\n     persistent idea that she may at any time get a child. She has had\r\n     this idea \"as long as she can remember,\" according to her first\r\n     expression. She never had any intimate acquaintance with any man,\r\n     she was never engaged, she hated bitterly every thought of\r\n     immorality, she knows and has assured herself by much reading that\r\n     it is entirely impossible that she might get a child without sexual\r\n     contact. Yet this thought recurs to her all the time, even when she\r\n     is talking with other people. It embarrasses her in school, in\r\n     spite of her teaching only girls in a private institution. This\r\n     thought keeps her away from company and the effect of its\r\n     embarrassing occurrence depresses her, but she is sure that the\r\n     thought itself does not include any emotion. It is a mere thinking\r\n     of it with a full consciousness that it is absurd, and yet she\r\n     cannot suppress it.\r\n\r\n     I began at once to try to find the origin of her queer obsession.\r\n     After some efforts to pierce into her memories, we came to an\r\n     experience of her youth. When she was about thirteen years of age,\r\n     a young girl whom she had admired much for her beauty, living in\r\n     the neighborhood of her parents, suddenly got a child which died\r\n     after a few days. At that time no thought of immorality seems to\r\n     have entered into that news. It was evidently mere sadness about\r\n     the quick death of the child which gave to the experience its\r\n     emotional tone. She was at that time completely naïve. She received\r\n     an intense shock in the thought that an unmarried girl may suddenly\r\n     get a child which would then quickly die. She cannot tell whether\r\n     the thought that she herself would get a child had ever entered her\r\n     mind before this occurrence in her neighborhood, nor can she say\r\n     that it occurred immediately or very soon after it. She now knows\r\n     only that she has always had that thought, but whether that means\r\n     more than ten years, she does not know.\r\n\r\n     I considered it a justifiable hypothesis that this strong emotional\r\n     experience early in life had become the starting point for that\r\n     secondary absurd thought. I considered that primary experience as\r\n     cause for a deep physiological brain excitement which had\r\n     irradiated towards the ideas of her personality. It had stirred up\r\n     there associations which kept their psychological character while\r\n     the primary disturbance had long lost its psychical accompaniment.\r\n     It worked its mischief in a physiological sphere but was probably\r\n     still the starting point for the persistent obsession. My aim was\r\n     to remove this cause. It would have brought little improvement\r\n     simply to suppress the freak idea as long as that physiological\r\n     source was active. On the other hand I should not have the means to\r\n     stop the physiological after-effects of that real experience: I had\r\n     to sidetrack it and to secure thus a reduction. I decided therefore\r\n     to work on the basis of that hypothesis, to accept that\r\n     physiological complex as existing, but to switch it off by linking\r\n     it with appropriate associations, thus setting it right in the\r\n     whole system of her thoughts.\r\n\r\n     For that purpose I brought her into a hypnoid state, bending her\r\n     head backwards and speaking to her with slow voice until I saw that\r\n     a slight drowsy state was reached. In this state I asked her to\r\n     think back as vividly as she could of that experience of her youth,\r\n     to fancy herself meeting that pretty girl, her neighbor, once more.\r\n     She is to imagine that she speaks with her. Now I make her talk\r\n     with me and she assures me that she sees the scene distinctly. She\r\n     believes she sees the girl on the street. I ask her to tell the\r\n     girl how indignant she feels over her behavior; she is to tell her\r\n     that she understands now all which she did not understand in her\r\n     childhood, that she knows now that she must have lived an immoral\r\n     life; that she must have had a friend and that a pure girl like\r\n     herself could never under any circumstances come into such a\r\n     situation, that no pure girl could suddenly have a child. She is to\r\n     express to the other girl her deepest disapproval of such conduct\r\n     and her own feeling of happiness that anything like that could\r\n     never happen to her. In accordance with my demands, she worked\r\n     herself entirely into the scene: without using audible voice, she\r\n     internally spoke with great vividness to her neighbor. When I awoke\r\n     her from her drowsy state, she was quite exhausted from the\r\n     excitement. I repeated that scene with her four times. She assured\r\n     me that she felt it every time more dramatically. The power of the\r\n     obsession weakened from the first day. After the fourth time, it\r\n     had disappeared. The subcortical complex had evidently found its\r\n     normal channels of discharge.\r\n\r\nIn discussing this method of side-tracking the complex, we mentioned\r\nthat in other cases the result is reached by bringing the memory of that\r\nfirst experience to a vivid motor discharge, without substituting any\r\nother ideas. For that purpose no direct personal influence is necessary.\r\nTreatment might just as well be performed \"by correspondence,\" provided\r\nthat the right starting point is discovered and that right suggestions\r\nare given. As an illustration, I may choose a case which shows at least\r\nthe maximum distance treatment by mail, from Boston to Seattle. This\r\nparticular case presented no difficulty in getting hold of the starting\r\npoint as my correspondent, whom I have never seen, himself at once\r\npointed to the original source of his obsessing idea.\r\n\r\n     The patient who lived with his family in Seattle wrote to me the\r\n     following: \"----I shall undertake to describe in a few words a\r\n     condition which the writer has fought against for about eight years\r\n     and which has subjected him to untold mental anguish.----I was\r\n     backward in a social way but altogether happy. After working in a\r\n     bank about a year, was discovered one evening by the cashier\r\n     smoking a cigar in the basement, was unable to look him in the face\r\n     at the time. Went home that night and thought very little about it,\r\n     but on the following morning during the regular course of business,\r\n     I stepped up to him to ask some question, and as usual,\r\n     unconsciously looked him in the face. His glance was questioning\r\n     and suspicious, and that was the beginning of a life of anguish for\r\n     me. At first I could not look him in the eyes, then when looking at\r\n     some other person, I happened to think of it and so on, until in\r\n     two or three days it was impossible to look at anyone who came to\r\n     my window. The cashier did everything he could for me. No use: I\r\n     quit my position, lost most of my friends, had to leave a happy\r\n     home and came to Seattle to work for an old school friend. In the\r\n     first year, owing to new environments, I managed to conceal my\r\n     mental condition to a certain degree. All of a sudden, I was again\r\n     plunged into the depths of black despair. It took me about two\r\n     years to (partially) forget it, when the same thing occurred again,\r\n     and I lost my grip. The last time about eighteen months ago was\r\n     almost more than I could stand. These three or four instances I\r\n     speak of were cases of extreme despondency, but my usual mental\r\n     condition is extremely unhappy. If occasions arise where I have to\r\n     sit and talk to anyone for ten minutes, controlling myself is such\r\n     an effort that it leaves me with a case of the blues.... I shall\r\n     come and see you as the relief would give me a new lease on life.\"\r\n\r\n     This letter was written on the twenty-third of January, 1908. I\r\n     replied to him at once that he certainly ought not to come from the\r\n     Pacific to the Atlantic, but that I wanted him to write to me much\r\n     more about that first occurrence. As he was evidently right in\r\n     considering that episode as the starting point of his troublesome\r\n     associations, I supposed that these associated ideas had not yet\r\n     become independent but were still the effect of that first\r\n     \"complex.\" Therefore I wanted to bring that to complete discharge.\r\n     Accordingly I wrote him to think himself once more into that\r\n     happening of years ago, to pass through it with all the power of\r\n     his imagination, to describe it to me then in as full a statement\r\n     as possible and to express in the letter also his conviction that\r\n     there was no reason to avoid the eyes of his superior, that he\r\n     might have looked straight into his face. As soon as he got my\r\n     reply, he wrote to me on the sixth of February a description of\r\n     that first episode, filling nineteen pages, telling me all about\r\n     his relations to those various men and every minute detail was\r\n     brought clearly to consciousness again. I did not add anything\r\n     further, but the expected occurred. On the eighteenth of February,\r\n     he writes to me: \"In the last week or ten days, the writer has\r\n     noted a decided improvement regarding mental condition. The result\r\n     is a new interest in life. If you can spare the time, would like to\r\n     have you write me a few lines. Gratefully yours.\" At the end of the\r\n     month he writes: \"Received your letter about half an hour ago.\r\n     Hasten to assure you with a great deal of pleasure that I am\r\n     feeling much better. Since sending you the letter regarding the\r\n     first case, I have noticed day by day an improvement.\" On the\r\n     eighth of March: \"Since writing you last I have noticed a gradual\r\n     improvement. It has given me wonderful encouragement.\" On the tenth\r\n     of March: \"Just a line to say that I am still improving.\" On the\r\n     twelfth of April: \"I desire to say that since the taking up of\r\n     treatment with you, life has had a far different appearance to me\r\n     than it has had for the last ten years.\" On the twenty-first of\r\n     April: \"Since my first letter to you, there has been such an\r\n     improvement that I have accepted a position which carries with it\r\n     much responsibility.\"\r\n\r\nThis case leads over to the large group in which the obsessing idea\r\ninvolves the relation to a particular person. I find in such cases\r\nautosuggestion more liberating than heterosuggestion if the development\r\nhas not gone too far. Of course autosuggestion can never take hypnotic\r\ncharacter, but makes use with profit of the transition state before\r\nnormal sleep. The type of these cases which are everywhere about us may\r\nbe indicated by the following letter.\r\n\r\n     The writer is a young woman of twenty-four, whom I did not know\r\n     personally. She wrote to me as follows: \"I am a writer by\r\n     profession and during the last year and a half have been connected\r\n     with a leading magazine. In my work, I was constantly associated\r\n     with one man, the managing editor. This man exerted a very peculiar\r\n     influence over me. With everyone else connected with the magazine,\r\n     I was my natural self and at ease, but the minute this man came\r\n     into the room, I became an entirely different person, timid,\r\n     nervous, and awkward, always placing myself and my work in a bad\r\n     light. But under this man's influence, I did a great deal of\r\n     literary work, my own and his too. I felt that he willed me to do\r\n     it. The effect of this influence was that I suffered constantly\r\n     from deep fits of depression almost amounting to melancholia. This\r\n     lasted until last fall, when I felt that I should lose my mind if I\r\n     stayed under his influence any longer. So I resigned my position\r\n     and broke away. Then I felt like a person who, having a drug to\r\n     stimulate him to do a certain amount of work, has that drug\r\n     suddenly taken away, and without it I am unable to write at\r\n     all....\" I wrote to the young lady that she could cure herself\r\n     without hypnotism and without my personal participation. I urged\r\n     her simply to speak to herself early in the morning and especially\r\n     in the evening before going to sleep, and to say to herself that\r\n     the man had never helped her at her work, but that she did it\r\n     entirely of her own power, and that he had never had any influence\r\n     on it, and that she can write splendidly since she has left the\r\n     place, and much better than before. A few months later, she came to\r\n     Cambridge and thanked me for the complete success which the\r\n     auto-suggestive treatment had secured. She was completely herself\r\n     again and was fully successful in filling a literary position in\r\n     which she had to write the editorials, the book reviews, the\r\n     dramatic criticisms, and the social news. As a matter of course,\r\n     such treatment had removed only the symptom. The over-suggestible\r\n     constitution had not been and could not be changed. Thus it was not\r\n     surprising that in the meantime, while her full literary strength\r\n     had come back, she had developed some entirely different symptoms\r\n     of bodily character which I had to remove by hypnotism.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the obsessing idea of the influence of another person takes\r\nstill a stronger hold and develops systems, the suspicion of insanity\r\nalways lies near; especially when hallucinations are superadded, the\r\nprobability is great that we then have to do with the delusions of a\r\nparanoiac, and thus no case for psychotherapeutic treatment. Yet it is\r\nalways wise to keep a psychasthenic interpretation in view as long as\r\nthe insanity is not evident. I may mention such an extreme case.\r\n\r\n     The patient, a man of middle age, highly educated, for years had\r\n     heard voices calling his name. A man with whom he had some personal\r\n     quarrel, had, as he believed, hypnotized him from a distance and\r\n     made him act queerly or do things which he really did not want to\r\n     do, by telepathic influence. It is a development which is found\r\n     quite frequently. Abnormal organic sensations or abnormal impulses\r\n     and inhibitions which the patient cannot account for by his own\r\n     motives become connected with some vague ideas which are in the\r\n     air, like wireless telegraphy or telepathy or hypnotism from a\r\n     distance or electrical influence, or magnetism or telephoning,\r\n     these then attached to an acquaintance who stands in a certain\r\n     emotional relation. Here, too, some organic sensations evidently\r\n     had been the starting point and the idea of the man with whom he\r\n     quarreled had been secondarily attached. From this starting point\r\n     more and more detail was reached. Every action was brought into\r\n     connection with the powerful enemy who controlled more and more\r\n     even the normal and reasonable doings of the patient. My first\r\n     impression was decidedly that of a paranoiac. Yet in some ways the\r\n     case suggested another view. There had remained an insight into the\r\n     unreality of the obsession. The patient did not really believe the\r\n     theory of the telepathic hypnotic influence. He felt it more as an\r\n     idea which he could not get rid of and he did not know clearly\r\n     himself whether he requested hypnotic treatment on my part for the\r\n     purpose of counteracting the hypnotic power of his enemy or for the\r\n     purpose of liberating him from his exasperating fixed idea.\r\n     Moreover, I found that his voices had no hallucinatory character,\r\n     but were merely sound images. I decided to make the experiment\r\n     without great hope of success.\r\n\r\n     I hypnotized the man deeply and suggested that no one can have\r\n     power over his actions, that he is the responsible originator of\r\n     everything that he does and that no one can influence him and that\r\n     from that hour he would feel free from any telepathic intrigue. The\r\n     effect of the very insistent and urgently repeated hypnotic\r\n     suggestion during the first rather long treatment was such a\r\n     surprisingly good one that I decided to continue the\r\n     psychotherapeutic cure. I hypnotized him daily for two weeks. The\r\n     belief in the real wrong doings of an enemy disappeared entirely\r\n     from the first. It was at once apprehended as a mere obsessing idea\r\n     in the own mind and this idea itself began to be resolved. It lost\r\n     its unity; the absurd impulses were still felt but they became less\r\n     and less connected with the idea of another man, and as soon as\r\n     they were rightly understood as doings of the own mind, the\r\n     opposite motives gained in strength. A stronger and stronger appeal\r\n     to his own power made these motives more and more influential.\r\n     Slowly the association of the influence of the other man faded away\r\n     entirely. I intentionally had not given any attention to the\r\n     pseudo-voices, inasmuch as they had not taken any relation to the\r\n     ideational delusion. I therefore did not include them in my\r\n     suggestions, as I consider it wise to confine hypnotic suggestions\r\n     always to as few points as possible. Yet these voices decreased\r\n     too. At a certain point in the cure I substituted--to save my own\r\n     time--an autosuggestive influence, or rather a mixed one, inasmuch\r\n     as I had him read ten times a day a letter of mine which contained\r\n     appropriate suggestions. After about six weeks, all the\r\n     disturbances for which he had sought my advice had disappeared.\r\n\r\nObsessing ideas of such personal influence involve of course always a\r\ncertain amount of emotional excitement and they may lead us to the\r\nunlimited field of disturbances in which the persecuting idea is\r\nsurrounded by emotional attitudes. Analysis shows easily that the\r\nemotion is an essential factor and that it persists in the disease while\r\nthe ideas to which it clings may change. Central is the emotion of fear;\r\nnearest to it that of worry, but any emotion may give color to the\r\nparticular case. Again any number of methods may be applied and a few\r\nillustrations with quite different ways of treatment may indicate more\r\nfully the character of the trouble. There is no doctor in the city and\r\nnone in the remotest village who may not find such cases in his near\r\nneighborhood. Of course slight degrees are easily hidden by the\r\npatient's own inhibition of external expression. If such suppression by\r\nthe own will secures a real overcoming of the unjustified emotion, this\r\nis surely better than to begin any medical treatment. But as the\r\nsuppression usually means simply lack of discharge and thus offers all\r\nthe conditions for an unhealthy inner growth of the trouble, the neglect\r\nof such disturbances is most regrettable, and frankness of the patient\r\nmust be encouraged. Such situation demands a careful observation of the\r\nwhole case and a subtle adjustment of the treatment to the individual\r\nneeds. It may perhaps be helpful at first simply to indicate the\r\nvarieties of the more frequent disturbances of this kind by quoting from\r\nvarious letters. Each case belongs to a type which can easily be removed\r\nby psychotherapeutic influence, generally even by a skillfully directed\r\nautosuggestion.\r\n\r\nThe writer is a young man.\r\n\r\n     \"I have always, as long as I can remember, been very nervous and\r\n     sensitive. When about seven years of age, I was attacked by St.\r\n     Vitus' Dance. Before that I cannot say whether I was particularly\r\n     nervous or not. Afterward it was impressed upon me by the remarks\r\n     of relatives that I was nervous, so that I soon took note of this\r\n     condition myself. The manner in which this weakness has been\r\n     especially troublesome is that it has caused me to be very shy. I\r\n     shrank from new acquaintances and disliked being observed. Often in\r\n     walking along on the street, I imagined myself closely noticed by\r\n     the passerby and I always felt uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n     \"About three years ago I suffered from typhoid fever and after\r\n     recovering, a new form of the old trouble showed itself. This time\r\n     I imagined that when eating I chewed my food in a manner that was\r\n     ridiculous and which made people hardly keep from laughter in\r\n     observing me. Often I had to leave the table when half through\r\n     because I felt I could not bear having critical eyes upon me any\r\n     longer. About three months ago I determined to be troubled no\r\n     further by my own foolish fancies and by constantly schooling\r\n     myself I have improved very much. Still, however, when I walk alone\r\n     along the street, I must fortify myself mentally before passing\r\n     each group of people. If once I allow myself to think that they are\r\n     looking at me, I feel almost paralyzed, my feet seem too heavy to\r\n     lift, my arms do not seem to swing naturally, and in attempting to\r\n     look placid and unconcerned, I feel that I am failing utterly. Also\r\n     when at table, I must still tell myself before each mouthful that I\r\n     have no need for fear, that my manner at table is equal and perhaps\r\n     superior to the others beside me. I have gone a certain length in\r\n     my self-training, and have relieved myself of a great deal of the\r\n     mental distress, but now I believe I can advance no further. What\r\n     seems needful now is to do away with the self-consciousness which\r\n     brought on my worries, though whether this is possible is hard to\r\n     say.\"\r\n\r\nHere the letter of a young woman, the type which fills the army of the\r\nmind healers and faith curists.\r\n\r\n     \"For years I have been seeking, or perhaps to be more accurate I\r\n     should say waiting, for a mind to drift toward me; a mind that\r\n     would understand my particular case of fear brought on by the\r\n     constant bullying and nagging from my earliest childhood by those\r\n     in my home. This fear of brutality has greatly depleted my nervous\r\n     system and has unfitted me for the strong, useful, forceful life I\r\n     should have expressed. If I could only rid my mind of the thought\r\n     that I am always displeasing, or rather, going to displease people,\r\n     for I hardly do displease them; if I could get rid of the fear of\r\n     caring what the attitude of other minds toward me is, I feel that I\r\n     should then strike out into a strong life of helpfulness to others.\r\n     In other words I have always felt behind me a great force pressing\r\n     me out into public work. When I was a child, it was so strong that\r\n     I was sat down upon brutally, to so great an extent that I feared\r\n     to voice my convictions and that fear still clings to me like a\r\n     nemesis. It seems that every individual personality in a public or\r\n     private audience rises up to overwhelm me, causing my tongue to\r\n     grow heavy and my mind to become a blank. This enervating fear\r\n     blends into every thought I have, whether sleeping or waking. I\r\n     have fought with all my might to rid myself of it but so far in\r\n     vain.\"\r\n\r\nHere an expression of a very frequent variety. The writer is a\r\nmiddle-aged man.\r\n\r\n     \"I am possessed of a fear that is constantly with me that something\r\n     dreadful is going to happen and I do not seem to be able to\r\n     overcome it. I am told by physicians that I am bodily sound,\r\n     although very nervous, and that the fear is generated entirely by\r\n     autosuggestion. When at its worst, it weakens and terrorizes me and\r\n     in my better moments I am tormented with a fear of a recurrence of\r\n     a bad spell. It is fear of a fear. A year ago at this time I had a\r\n     very bad spell but got along fairly well through the summer, but I\r\n     am afraid that I will soon again be in a bad condition and lose all\r\n     that I may have gained.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"fear of a fear\" is indeed a symptom which the psychotherapist has\r\nto fight extremely often, but as soon as he has really recognized it and\r\nanalyzed the whole mental condition, he will hardly have any difficulty\r\nin uprooting it. I add a letter of a school-teacher in New York. He\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n     \"I am teaching in a high school. I am of a nervous temperament and\r\n     constitutionally limited in endurance. Often my work is done in a\r\n     condition of greater or less exhaustion. I find that I blush very\r\n     easily in purely freakish ways, when there is no occasion for it. I\r\n     find this blushing connecting itself with certain of the girl\r\n     pupils of my classes in a conspicuous way. It occurs hardly ever\r\n     except when my class is facing me and I seem to be powerless to\r\n     overcome it. I have always tried to live a careful moral life, but\r\n     my early life was very much secluded. I lacked entirely the free\r\n     intercourse young people usually have together and I felt awkward\r\n     with others for a long time. In the matter of the blushing, it\r\n     sometimes occurs in the case of girls who are especially pleasing\r\n     to me but also not infrequently in the case of some who are not at\r\n     all so. The whole thing might be passed over were it not that it\r\n     has considerable effect in causing constraint toward my students\r\n     and in some cases affecting them very strongly in an emotional way\r\n     at the very time of life when such things can do most harm. I\r\n     regard the matter as being so serious that it brings directly in\r\n     question my right to teach, but I do not feel at all sure I could\r\n     find other work that I could do if I give up my present position.\r\n     The very thought that on a particular occasion it would be\r\n     extremely awkward to blush makes it almost impossible for me to\r\n     avoid it.\"\r\n\r\nBut we have rather now to consider the therapeutic side, and we may\r\nbegin again with a routine method of a simple hypnotic treatment.\r\n\r\n     The patient is a young university professor. His intellectual work\r\n     is perfect in all directions. There are no nervous symptoms, though\r\n     there are some slight disturbances of digestion. He suffers as soon\r\n     as he comes into a crowd of people and as soon as he is on any high\r\n     place, where he has to look down; the worst when both conditions\r\n     are combined, as for instance, at a concert or a theatre in a\r\n     balcony seat. But every meeting of many persons, even at church,\r\n     produces all the symptoms of nervous excitement. He was easily\r\n     brought into hypnotic state by verbal suggestions. When he was in\r\n     hypnosis, I reënforced the conditions for an opposite attitude. I\r\n     told him that as soon as he was in a crowd of persons he would feel\r\n     especially comfortable, would enjoy himself, would fully enter into\r\n     the spirit of the occasion and feel especially secure in their\r\n     presence. Whenever he should be on a high place, he would enjoy the\r\n     safety of the ground on which he was standing or the seat on which\r\n     he was sitting. I assured him that he would neglect entirely\r\n     whatever he saw and would rely completely on his safe feeling\r\n     resulting from his tactual impressions. After having hypnotized him\r\n     three times the disturbance disappeared completely, and even an\r\n     evening at the theatre in an exposed box on the balcony was enjoyed\r\n     without any discomfort. After about a year, at a period of\r\n     fatiguing work, some traces of the anxiety appeared again. This\r\n     time two hypnotic sittings were sufficient to remove the\r\n     disturbance of the equilibrium, which as far as I know has not come\r\n     back. The same hypnotic treatments were used in a secondary way to\r\n     remove the digestive trouble.\r\n\r\nI again quote the case of a teacher, a profession in which the\r\npsychasthenics are unusually frequent. It is a case of a young woman\r\nfrom the Middle West.\r\n\r\n     The young lady wrote me: \"I come of a race of strong women and am\r\n     not hysterical or easily frightened by many things that disturb\r\n     women. Since my fifteenth year I have been seized by hallucinations\r\n     of absurd or serious nature which no reasoning could explain away\r\n     and which have gradually undermined my power of resistance to them.\r\n     At the age of twenty-two, after a year of unusually hard work, my\r\n     nervous endurance gave way, and with this breakdown came a sense of\r\n     fear and a horror of crime that I have been unable to overcome. I\r\n     have never felt the slightest inclination toward wrongdoing. It is\r\n     a feeling rather that my shrinking from any mention of evil makes\r\n     it impossible for me to listen or think rationally when such things\r\n     are discussed. This feeling has seemed to change my whole attitude\r\n     toward life and has left me without power to control my facial\r\n     expression or carriage when it takes possession of me. I have been\r\n     able to teach more successfully than I could hope, but it is only\r\n     by cutting myself off from the friendships and pleasures incident\r\n     to my life that I am able to accomplish my work. I have fought this\r\n     trouble alone and will still do so if there is no help, but the\r\n     thought that it is the source of great distress to those dear to me\r\n     makes it very hard.\"\r\n\r\n     A few weeks later the lady insisted on coming to Cambridge. I found\r\n     that there had never been any hallucinations and that she used the\r\n     word in her letter only to indicate some insistent memory images\r\n     which had never taken the vividness of real impressions. In the\r\n     presence of her friend, I hypnotized her deeply and strengthened\r\n     through urgent suggestions her consciousness of her having done the\r\n     morally right thing at every situation in her life and her\r\n     conviction that she never did and never would commit a crime. Here\r\n     as always, if possible, I left alone the emotional idea but\r\n     reënforced the opposite. The effect was an immediate one. She felt\r\n     freer the next day than she had felt for years. I repeated the\r\n     treatment a few times and she assured me that the feeling had\r\n     disappeared entirely.\r\n\r\nI take the rather severe case of a woman of fifty.\r\n\r\n     The highly educated and refined lady had lost her husband by an\r\n     accident in Switzerland, which had been misrepresented by some of\r\n     the newspapers as suicide. Two years later she wrote to me: \"I feel\r\n     as if I had received indelible photographs on my brain which have\r\n     since greatly affected my health and from which I may never\r\n     recover. This winter the symptoms I have been able to control\r\n     returned and I have been ill. I unfortunately saw the newspaper\r\n     headlines with my husband's supposed suicide. Though I exclaimed\r\n     then, 'how outrageous,' I felt as if I had been struck and since\r\n     then I can seldom read a paper without dread and apprehension, and\r\n     the hearing of anyone's suicide fills me with terror. When I\r\n     hurried to Europe, on the ocean a week from the day of my husband's\r\n     death, I had a curious and overwhelming shock. On opening a drawer\r\n     and seeing a pair of scissors, they looked to me like a dagger and\r\n     suddenly the whole cabin seemed filled with implements of death.\r\n     The doctors said that I would find it hard to get over such\r\n     impressions but I told them I would, as I had courage and will. But\r\n     I have been realizing in these two years that I may be suffering\r\n     from something that may be beyond the control of will. I often\r\n     become so nervously sensitive that scissors are unbearable for me\r\n     to see, or a steel knife or anything that might express death. Our\r\n     family physicians are still against hypnotism, and if I should go\r\n     to a neurologist of my own selection, it might be to one who\r\n     believed still only in nerve foods, baths, or a sanitarium.\"\r\n\r\n     The lady came from the South, with her nurse, to Boston and\r\n     insisted on being hypnotized by me. I cannot say whether a really\r\n     deep hypnotic state was produced at once as I refrained from\r\n     testing it. There was certainly no amnesia. Probably it began only\r\n     with a slight drowsiness but at the fifth treatment I found a\r\n     relatively deep hypnosis. It was a capricious case in which the\r\n     improvement was fluctuating but clearly setting in from the first\r\n     day. I trained her in hearing and seeing words like death and\r\n     suicide with a reënforced feeling of strength and calmness; I\r\n     forced her to see and touch scissors with an artificial attitude of\r\n     strength and indifference. At the same time I reënforced her good\r\n     mood and her enjoyment in life. When she left for England a few\r\n     weeks later, she felt herself mentally cured, and throughout the\r\n     summer her letters testified the wonderful change which the\r\n     treatment had brought about. Half a year later, as the result of\r\n     an exhausting physical local treatment, the psychophysiological\r\n     symptoms came back to a certain degree. She requested me by a\r\n     letter from England to give her some help by suggestion to suppress\r\n     again the recurring intrusions. As I had observed her strong\r\n     suggestibility, I sent her over the ocean a little pencil of\r\n     mother-of-pearl which she had seen in my hand, and advised her to\r\n     look at it until she counted twenty slowly and then to close her\r\n     eyes and simply to sleep. The autosuggestive effect was unusually\r\n     strong. She writes from London: \"When I saw the enclosure of your\r\n     letter I felt as if it would burn through my hand and the feeling\r\n     became so overpowering that I locked it away with my jewels, but as\r\n     the days ran into a week I felt I could not live with it in my\r\n     apartment any more, and I felt almost ill, until it occurred to me\r\n     I could seal it and take it to my bankers. I felt as dreamy and\r\n     absent-minded and paralyzed as if you had just treated me.\"\r\n     Nevertheless the effect was on the whole the desired one and she\r\n     returned to America with a wholesome freedom of mind. I hypnotized\r\n     her twice again and she writes in her last letter: \"I can never\r\n     repay you for what you have done for me. You have given me back my\r\n     courage and my love of life in its vividness and interest and\r\n     color, all that through the last years I had so entirely lost.\"\r\n\r\nEven in cases where the disease itself is inaccessible to\r\npsychotherapeutic treatment, the superadded grief and worry brought on\r\nby the disease might yield to the mental influence and the whole\r\nsituation would to a high degree be transformed for the better by it. I\r\nhave often been asked to hypnotize in such cases, where the depression\r\nwas wrongly taken as a part of the nervous disease; sometimes I agreed\r\nto do it in spite of feeling sure that the disease itself could not be\r\nremoved. I quote an instance.\r\n\r\n     A young woman afflicted with epilepsy was brought up in the belief\r\n     that she had only from time to time fainting attacks from overwork,\r\n     and with them secondarily neurasthenic symptoms, especially spells\r\n     of depression colored by a constant fear of the next fainting. She\r\n     had heard voices all her life and they frightened her in an\r\n     intolerable way. I produced a very slight hypnotic state. I\r\n     concentrated my effort entirely on suggestions which were to give\r\n     her new interest in life, and diminished the emotional character of\r\n     the voices without even trying to make them disappear. I proceeded\r\n     for several months. The young woman herself believed that the\r\n     fainting attacks came less frequently afterwards; yet I am inclined\r\n     to think that that is an illusion. But there was no doubt that her\r\n     whole personality became almost a different one with the new share\r\n     in the world. The epilepsy remained probably unchanged but all the\r\n     superadded emotions were annihilated and she felt an entirely new\r\n     courage which allowed her to control herself between her regular\r\n     attacks. She had been unable to undertake any regular work before\r\n     for a long while, but all that improved. More than a year\r\n     afterward, she wrote me: \"I have really worked most of the time\r\n     this past winter and spring and I think I can see a steady though\r\n     slow gain. I am reading quite a little and doing it for the most\r\n     part easily. To be sure I have, after I have read, hard times with\r\n     the voices but their character is usually less determined and\r\n     fearful than formerly. Several times I have thought I must come\r\n     again to you but each time I have started again to fight it out for\r\n     myself, but now, as I am gaining, I can better estimate the great\r\n     help your influence was to me at a juncture when everything seemed\r\n     so hopeless and helpless.\"\r\n\r\nEven in slight psychasthenic disturbances, the psychotherapeutic\r\ninfluence is not always successful, especially if there is no time for\r\nfull treatment. But it is very interesting to see how even in such cases\r\nthe symptom is somehow changing, almost breaking to pieces. It becomes\r\nclear that a protracted effort in the same direction would destroy the\r\ntrouble completely. Typical is a case like the following.\r\n\r\n     An elderly woman has been troubled her life long by a\r\n     disproportionate fear of thunderstorms with almost hysterical\r\n     symptoms. As she had no other complaint, I hardly found it worth\r\n     while to enter into a systematic treatment and could not expect\r\n     much of a change from a short treatment, considering that her\r\n     hysteric response had lasted through half a century. As she begged\r\n     for some treatment, I brought her into a drowsy state and told her\r\n     that she would in future enjoy the thunderstorms as noble\r\n     expressions of nature. The whole procedure took a few minutes. Yet\r\n     after some summer months she wrote me a letter which clearly\r\n     indicated this characteristic compromise between the habitual dread\r\n     and the reënforced counter idea. \"I have the same sick dread at the\r\n     sight of thunder clouds that I have always had, but I seem to have\r\n     gotten somehow a most desperate determination to control my fear. I\r\n     have done this to the extent of keeping my eyes open and looking at\r\n     the storm. Is that hypnotism or pride?\"\r\n\r\nAnother thunderstorm case may lead us to other methods of treatment.\r\nHere again in the field of emotional response, we may consider the\r\nmethods of going back to primary experience, known or forgotten.\r\n\r\n     A young married woman of the West had suffered always from\r\n     hysterical attacks in response to any sharp sudden impressions,\r\n     especially sudden loud noises. The banging of a door, but worst of\r\n     all a thunderstorm, could produce hours of weeping and crying and\r\n     desperate mental condition with all expressions of excitement. Her\r\n     husband wanted me to hypnotize her but I preferred another way. I\r\n     tried to get her memory back to the earliest case of which she\r\n     could think of this hysterical response. As long as we were in\r\n     ordinary conversation, she could not trace it beyond about her\r\n     twelfth year. But when I brought her into a drowsy state, her\r\n     memory revived older experiences and finally settled at a school\r\n     experience in her seventh year of age. She then had an excitable\r\n     country school-teacher who relied on whipping the children. Once\r\n     her neighbor in the class did something forbidden. Her teacher\r\n     mistook her for the culprit and began to whip her most forcibly\r\n     before she could explain anything; and while the punishment was\r\n     going on and she began to bleed from a wound, she all the time felt\r\n     that she wanted to express her innocence and could not speak. After\r\n     that, evidently the first attack of hysteric character followed.\r\n     From that time on any sudden impression released the same group of\r\n     reactions. The suppressed emotion had evidently become a\r\n     psychophysical \"complex.\" As soon as I had reached this starting\r\n     point of her pathological history, I asked her to bring back to\r\n     consciousness as many details as possible of that first incident.\r\n     She told me all the names and described the classroom and brought\r\n     herself vividly into the whole situation. Then I asked her to tell\r\n     me the whole story once more and to express strongly her innocence\r\n     and the wrongness of the punishment, and when she had completed her\r\n     account, brought out with fullest indignation, I had her tell the\r\n     whole thing once more and then a third and a fourth time, until she\r\n     was quite tired out from it. That was all I did. Very soon after,\r\n     the husband reported that there was a great improvement in every\r\n     respect, no hysteric attacks, only slight discomfort. Most of the\r\n     stimuli which had previously produced strong reactions now passed\r\n     without any disturbance and even thunderstorms were experienced\r\n     with relative ease. A year later they came once more to Cambridge,\r\n     and she simply passed once more through the same process of\r\n     discharge which seems now to have removed the symptoms still\r\n     further.\r\n\r\nBy far more reliable, however, is the method of side-tracking the\r\nstarting experience into a new associational track.\r\n\r\n     A gentleman with a decidedly psychasthenic constitution developed a\r\n     tendency to hesitate in walking on the street. It was not a\r\n     complete stumbling but a disturbing inhibition, which set in when\r\n     he was walking alone and his attention was not absorbed by\r\n     something on the street. He believed that it came on most strongly\r\n     when he looked down at the pavement. He suffered from it vehemently\r\n     and avoided going on the street alone. He was unable to connect it\r\n     with any starting point. He interpreted it as merely a symptom of\r\n     overwork. But going with him through all kinds of experiences which\r\n     he had had on the street in previous years, we finally found that\r\n     once he was running to catch a street car, when he suddenly saw\r\n     almost immediately before him a big hole dug out for laying gas\r\n     pipes. He was able to stop himself quickly enough not to fall into\r\n     the hole but he got a strong emotional shock from the experience.\r\n     He, himself, did not think that his walking troubles set in\r\n     immediately after this shock. Yet the hypothesis seemed to me\r\n     sufficiently justified that there existed a connection, even though\r\n     some weeks lay between that first experience and the first\r\n     observation of the abnormal inhibition in walking. On that basis I\r\n     tried to train a new associative connection. I made him drowsy and\r\n     asked him to think himself once more into the situation of his run\r\n     for the car but as soon as he reached the hole to jump over it. He\r\n     went through this motor feature on ten successive days with new and\r\n     ever new energy and from that time up to the present the trouble on\r\n     the street has disappeared entirely.\r\n\r\nTo mention at least one case of the large group in which suppressed\r\nsexual emotion was the evident source of an anxiety-neurosis, I mention\r\nthe case of a woman who showed very strong symptoms of anxiety and\r\noppression and who was cured by a simple advice.\r\n\r\n     The woman, aged thirty-two, was a saleswoman in a large store\r\n     selling gentlemen's gloves and ties. She suffered from time to time\r\n     by attacks of vague anxiety in which her heart showed vehement\r\n     palpitation. There were paleness and perspiration and at the height\r\n     a nervous trembling together with a feeling of despair. These\r\n     attacks were not frequent, separated sometimes by weeks, sometimes\r\n     by months, but troubling her exceedingly. She had been assured by a\r\n     physician that her heart was normal and that she was probably\r\n     overworked. She could find absolutely no source of the disturbance.\r\n     After a long conversation, I was also unable to discover any direct\r\n     or indirect causes until I worked on the basis of those theories\r\n     which we have discussed, the theories which connect hysteric\r\n     symptoms with chance intrusions which stand in relations to past\r\n     suppressed emotions of sexual character. The patient absolutely\r\n     denied any present sexual emotions. She had been engaged about\r\n     eight years before and acknowledged that at that time there were\r\n     strong sexual feelings connected with her fiancé, who broke the\r\n     engagement. Psychoanalytic methods now brought it to full clearness\r\n     that she had her first attack after selling a pair of gloves and\r\n     fitting them to the hand of a male customer who had a certain\r\n     similarity to her fiancé. It was not possible to trace this in the\r\n     same way for later cases too, but it seems that bodily contact with\r\n     a man by fitting gloves preceded every attack. All this was brought\r\n     out partly by questions, partly by free ascending associations\r\n     while she, herself, believed that she simply pronounced nonsense\r\n     words as they came to her mind, and partly it was secured in a\r\n     half-hypnotic state. I came to the conclusion that the suppressed\r\n     sexual emotions at the breaking of the engagement were the primary\r\n     cause of the disease. The similarity of the first customer together\r\n     with the tactual sensations had evidently touched that complex and\r\n     brought the suppressed emotion to an explosion which frequently\r\n     takes the form of palpitation and similar symptoms. Later the mere\r\n     tactual sensation alone produced by the contact with the hand of a\r\n     man, possibly with a similar optical impression, perhaps also with\r\n     the sound of the voice, brought back the reaction. Instead of\r\n     giving treatment, I insisted that she change stores, and become\r\n     saleswoman in a house where she would have to do only with women,\r\n     and to sell articles which did not bring her into personal contact\r\n     with customers. After more than six months of work in her new\r\n     place, she reported that the attacks had not come back again.\r\n\r\nOf course it may readily be acknowledged that this method does not allow\r\na sharp demarcation line between its various factors. It cannot be\r\ndenied that an element of straight suggestion may be included. The man\r\nwhom I train in the forming of a new antagonistic motor response feels\r\nit of course all the time also as a silent suggestion to overcome the\r\nold disturbance. It is thus to a certain degree impossible to say where\r\nthe effect of the discharge ends and where that of the hidden suggestion\r\nbegins. Yet there certainly cannot be any doubt that this revival of the\r\nfirst experience and its improved discharge works directly towards the\r\nremoval of the troublesome symptom.\r\n\r\nAbnormal fear is also the essential factor in most cases of stammering.\r\nThe patients usually know it themselves. For instance, a lawyer writes\r\nto me:\r\n\r\n     \"I have been a stammerer the greater part of my life and have\r\n     visited every stammering school in the country, but the relief\r\n     obtained has been temporary and in most cases I was not benefited\r\n     at all. I am convinced that stammering is due wholly to an abnormal\r\n     mental condition, which consists of an unreasoning fear that takes\r\n     possession of the individual when he attempts to utter certain\r\n     sounds. It is simply a lack of confidence inspired by numberless\r\n     failures to articulate properly and is not caused by any organic\r\n     trouble, because, taking my own case for example, I can at times\r\n     talk as fluently and easily as anyone. I am firmly convinced that\r\n     stammering can be cured by hypnotic suggestion. If you could get me\r\n     in the hypnotic state and suggest to me repeatedly that from\r\n     thenceforth I would have easy fluent speech, I feel absolutely\r\n     certain that such would be the case.\"\r\n\r\nOr an engineer writes to me:\r\n\r\n     \"At times I stammer very badly. In an ordinary conversation it is\r\n     scarcely perceptible, but it is almost impossible for me to make an\r\n     explanation or relate an incident or tell an anecdote. I began to\r\n     stammer when I was about seven years of age--I am twenty-nine\r\n     now--and continued until I was seventeen, when I broke myself of it\r\n     by reading aloud. It came back on me about a year ago, at which\r\n     time I was laboring under a very severe nervous strain on account\r\n     of business matters. I have since tried to break myself of it in\r\n     the way that I did at first, reading aloud, but have been unable to\r\n     do so. Can it be cured by hypnotic treatment or suggestion? Can any\r\n     hypnotist of ordinary ability do it?\"\r\n\r\nI should affirm this question, which is one of the most frequent put to\r\nthe psychotherapist. And yet, if I myself have entirely given up the\r\ncure of stammerers in recent years, it was not only because there was\r\nlittle chance to learn anything new scientifically from it but also\r\nbecause it was ultimately disappointing, as the severe cases cannot be\r\ncured entirely. Every hypnotist can quickly secure a strong improvement.\r\nIn even new cases I found an almost surprising improvement in the first\r\ntwo weeks, an improvement which stirs up the most vivid hopes of the\r\nsufferers. Then the improvement becomes slower and finally it stops\r\nbefore a complete cure is reached. The patient notices it and it easily\r\nworks back on his emotion and thus begins again to disturb the speech,\r\nunless a very careful continuous counter-suggestion is given. Slight\r\ndisturbances, to be sure, can be removed entirely. The essential point\r\nwill always be to suggest to the stammerer the full belief that he is\r\nable to speak every word and that he is able to speak it in every\r\nsituation. But where there is a limit for improvement, we must take for\r\ngranted that the disturbing fear is only superadded to an organic\r\ntrouble. In such cases, probably the inability of certain nervous paths\r\nwas primarily irreparable. These inabilities then became the source of\r\ndiscomfort and of fear and this fear added greatly to the disturbance.\r\nHypnotism then quickly removes that part of the disturbance which had\r\nbeen superadded by the mental emotion but it cannot remove that primary\r\nfactor, the objective inability, and every cure thus finds its limit\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nNear the field of emotions stand also the many varieties of sexual\r\nabnormities and perversities. I abstain from discussing any special\r\ncases but it may be said that suggestive treatment is in this region\r\npowerful to an almost surprising degree. Even homosexual tendencies\r\nwhich go back to the beginnings of the memory of the individual yield,\r\nas my experience shows, in a few weeks, if again the suggestion is not\r\nso much directed towards the suppression as to the creation of the\r\nantagonistic reaction, that means in this case, of the normal sexual\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nBoth ideas and emotions, of course, lead to actions. Moreover we always\r\ninsisted that the resulting action is an essential part of the\r\npsychophysical situation and that every mental experience has to be\r\ncharacterized as a starting point for action. Yet this factor of\r\nactivity and of attitude sometimes stands in the foreground. The\r\ncontrolling idea is then the idea of an end of action, the predominant\r\nemotion, the emotion anticipated from a certain activity. Typical for\r\nthat are those disturbances in which an abnormal impulse or an abnormal\r\ndesire awakes perhaps a desire for ruinous drugs like morphine or\r\ncocaine or an impulse to criminal deeds, like stealing. But the\r\ndisturbances of the psychomotor factor are not less present when the\r\ncentral complaint is a lack of energy, the most frequent symptom of the\r\nneurasthenic; and our whole discussion has made it clear that a mere\r\nlack of attention belongs to the same category.\r\n\r\nOf course, the abnormal impulse is psychophysically not different,\r\nwhether it leads to a legally important result like the impulse to kill\r\nor leads to an indifferent result. The subjective suffering may be the\r\nsame in both cases. The starting point of the impulse may be any chance\r\nexperience. The psychasthenic may pick up such impulses from any model\r\nfor imitation or from any haphazard report. It may be entirely freakish\r\nand yet beyond conscious control.\r\n\r\n     A physician had read in a well-known book on hysteria about a case\r\n     in which a girl was troubled by a constant effort to move the big\r\n     toe in her shoes. This idea worked on him as a suggestion for\r\n     several months. At my advice he fought it by auto-suggestion. He\r\n     brought himself into a slightly drowsy state by staring into a\r\n     crystal ball and assuring himself by spoken sentences with\r\n     monotonous repetition for a long while that he has perfectly the\r\n     power to hold the toe at rest. From the second day only a slight\r\n     kinæsthetic sensation remained; the movement itself disappeared.\r\n\r\nOr a more unusual case.\r\n\r\n     A young lady once noticed in a man a different color in the two\r\n     eyes. It gave her an uncanny feeling, together with the natural\r\n     impulse to compare the two eyes. Accordingly she shifted her own\r\n     eyes from one eyeball to the other in the man's face. The accent\r\n     which this shifting impulse had received by the disagreeable\r\n     feeling evidently forced her to repeat this movement with everyone.\r\n     At first it became half a play, but soon a disturbing habit and\r\n     finally an intolerable impulse. Whenever she talked with anyone,\r\n     she lost control of her eyes and was obliged to enter into a kind\r\n     of pendulum movement from eye to eye. The situation became so\r\n     unendurable that the thought of suicide began to occur to her. I\r\n     hypnotized her four times, suggesting to her complete indifference\r\n     as to the face of those with whom she spoke and at the same time\r\n     certain new habits of fixation. The impulse lost its hold and when\r\n     I saw her last, it had completely disappeared.\r\n\r\nBy far more frequent than such neutral impulses are the desires, for\r\ninstance, of the alcoholist. On the whole it may be said that\r\npsychotherapy can gain its easiest triumphs in the field of alcoholism\r\nand a wide propagation of psychotherapeutic methods and of a thorough\r\nunderstanding of psychotherapy would be fully justified, even if no\r\nother field were accessible but that of the desire for alcoholic\r\nintemperance. The moral disaster and economic ruin resulting from\r\nalcoholic intemperance, the physical harm to the drinker and to his\r\noffspring is so enormous, and the temporary cure of the victim is so\r\nprobable that the movement certainly deserves most serious interest. Yet\r\nI speak of temporary cure and I refer here especially to the restriction\r\nwith which I introduced the psychotherapeutic methods in general. They\r\ndo not deal with diseases but with symptoms; and they certainly do not\r\ndeal with constitutions, but with results of the coöperation of\r\nconstitution and circumstances. That the given constitution may be\r\nbrought anew under conditions which again stir up similar symptoms is\r\nalways possible, and just with alcoholism the danger lies near unless\r\nbeneficial influences remain in power. Certainly no one has a right to\r\nneglect such psychotherapeutic aid simply because relapses are possible.\r\nEven a temporary relief can be a great blessing. Moreover, the temporary\r\nrelief is the safest basis to work towards the prevention of a\r\nrecurrence of the evil. Only in two directions is further restriction\r\nneeded. Psychotherapeutic methods are in my opinion of very small avail\r\nin cases of periodic drinkers. Such periodic attacks of patients who\r\nhave not even a desire for alcohol in intervals between the attacks,\r\nintervals which may last a quarter of a year, are related to epilepsy.\r\nIt seems that constant hypnotic influence during the interval has a\r\ncertain power to reduce the periodic impulse. I personally have not\r\nseen any special improvement from it. The second restriction would be\r\nthat the drinker has to be under constant supervision during the first\r\ndays of hypnotic treatment. No patient, not even the morphinist, is so\r\nskillful in deceiving his friends and even the physician. Even the most\r\nemphatic gestures of sincerity ought to be distrusted.\r\n\r\n     Only a short time ago I dealt with a young man whom his parents and\r\n     a chauffeur had accompanied to Boston, exclusively for the purpose\r\n     of watching him constantly while I was to attempt to cure him from\r\n     excessive whiskey drinking. The chauffeur accompanied him from his\r\n     room in the Boston hotel to the threshold of my laboratory. All\r\n     through the day he was with his parents, and at the hotel the\r\n     management had given the strictest orders not to sell any drink to\r\n     the young spendthrift. He was an earlier student of mine and had\r\n     attached himself to me with such an apparent sincerity as removed\r\n     every possible doubt of his pledge. Intentionally I had not even\r\n     asked him for a pledge not to drink but only for a pledge to\r\n     confess to me the next day if he ever should take any alcohol. In a\r\n     tentative way I suggested to him in a half hypnotic state on the\r\n     first day that he would feel disgust for whiskey. I did not expect\r\n     much of an improvement before at least three or four treatments. I\r\n     was therefore most surprised when he most solemnly assured me the\r\n     next day that he awoke in the morning with an assured feeling that\r\n     he should never touch whiskey again and that he had not the\r\n     slightest desire for it. Instead of a systematic development of\r\n     suggestions, I confined myself therefore to a mere repetition of\r\n     the treatment of the first day and as every morning the same\r\n     assurance came forth, there seemed to be no need for any\r\n     variation. It was not before the fifth day that I discovered that\r\n     he had taken from the start a pint of whiskey every day. When he\r\n     first arrived he had bribed a laundress of the hotel to bring to\r\n     his room every day the whiskey hidden in the laundry and he drank\r\n     it during the night. Then I declined any further participation.\r\n\r\nThe danger of deceit is of course less imminent when not the family but\r\nthe patient himself takes the initiative. Yet even here distrust is\r\nwise. The patient has sometimes the most sincere intention to be cured,\r\nbut under pressure of his craving he admits compromises which he hides\r\nfrom the physician. Having reduced the large quantity of alcohol to\r\nwhich he was accustomed, he hides the fact that he yet takes a few\r\ndrinks, which he thinks cannot prevent the cure. Yet inasmuch as a\r\ncomplete cure has to rely on psychical factors, this consciousness of\r\ndeceiving even with small transgressions interferes badly with progress\r\nand, inasmuch as the cunningness of the patient is itself a symptom of\r\nthe disturbance, the strongest possible precaution is advisable at the\r\nbeginning. For that reason it is also not best to begin at once with\r\ncomplete prohibition, but to lead to a total abstinence in about one\r\nweek. But certainly in the case of every drunkard, total abstinence is\r\nthe only desirable goal. A pronounced drinker ought never to be\r\ntransformed simply into a moderate one. The return to intemperance would\r\nresult rapidly. On the other hand it would be unfair to deny that\r\npsychotherapy has cured the symptom if the desire really once\r\ndisappeared completely, even if, after years, new temptations develop a\r\nnew desire. I myself had diphtheria three times in my life; my\r\nconstitution is thus probably especially favorable to that disease but I\r\ndo not estimate less the fact that I was perfectly cured the second\r\ntime, in spite of the fact that I caught it a few years later a third\r\ntime. To be sure, such experiences of relapse cannot be spared any\r\npsychotherapist. I may give a typical instance.\r\n\r\n     A well-known professional man of fifty years, through a long\r\n     bachelorhood, was accustomed to close his work at four o'clock and\r\n     then to sit comfortably in his study with a book and an unlimited\r\n     supply of brandy. He took one cognac after another and every\r\n     evening he was completely intoxicated. He married a young wife and\r\n     felt the need of changing his habits, the more as he himself saw\r\n     symptoms of his excess which alarmed him. When he came to me, I saw\r\n     that he was seriously wishing to give up, and he understood himself\r\n     that there was only the one way, namely, complete abstinence. He\r\n     felt that he could not reach it by his own will power alone and\r\n     sought my aid. I hypnotized him six times, suggesting at first a\r\n     reduction to four drinks, then to two, then to one and then to pure\r\n     mineral water. I concentrated my effort on stirring up the\r\n     antagonistic attitude, the dislike of the smell of brandy and the\r\n     aversion to its taste. The effect was excellent. After the fifth\r\n     time the mental torture which he had felt in the first afternoons\r\n     had completely disappeared. I considered further hypnotizing\r\n     superfluous and felt sure after the sixth time that the man was\r\n     cured. For about a year he remained abstinent, but in the meantime\r\n     his professional life brought severe disappointments, and with cool\r\n     consideration he decided that he might have at least some pleasure\r\n     from life and forget its miseries. Accordingly after a year he\r\n     determined again to take some brandy in his study, and of course,\r\n     that led rapidly to an increase of the dose and today he is\r\n     probably at the old point. And yet it may be said with correctness\r\n     that psychotherapy had done its duty. If at the right moment before\r\n     he took the first step again, even the slightest counter-suggestion\r\n     had been applied, the disastrous second development could have been\r\n     easily avoided.\r\n\r\nMy experience indicates the best results where the suggestions are from\r\nthe start directed as much against the unfavorable social conditions,\r\nwith their temptations and impulses to imitation, as against the\r\nalcoholic beverages themselves. On the whole it is easier to break the\r\nvicious drinking habits of the social drinker than those of the lonely\r\ndrinker, a point which ought to be well considered in settling the\r\ncomplex problem of prohibition versus the temperance movement.\r\n\r\nThe situation of alcoholism repeats itself in still more ruinous forms\r\nwith morphinism and cocainism, vices which grow in this country to an\r\nalarming degree. The psychotherapeutic treatment of such drug habits\r\ndemands much patience and much skillful adjustment to the psychological\r\nconditions. Its general difference from the treatment of alcoholism is\r\ngiven by the circumstance that any too rapid withdrawing of the drug is\r\ncertainly dangerous, if the organism is adjusted to a relatively strong\r\ndose. On the other hand, I may say that I have not seen a single case\r\nin which a really patient and insistent treatment of morphinism has not\r\nbeen successful, even if the destructive dose of forty grains a day had\r\nbecome habitual. The condition is only that the patient himself have the\r\nbest will, a will which yet is not strong enough to win the fight\r\nwithout psychotherapeutic help. But no one ought to expect that the\r\npsychotherapist can secure miracles like some of the pill cures which\r\ntreat the drug fiend in three days. Moreover neither physician nor\r\npatient ought to believe that the worst is to come at the beginning. On\r\nthe contrary, it is the end which is hardest, the reduction of the small\r\ndose to nothing. As illustration, I give an extreme case.\r\n\r\n     A man who was formerly station master on a railroad had been\r\n     operated on in a hospital after an accident, and as some pain in\r\n     the hip remained which disturbed his sleep, the physician of the\r\n     hospital gave him some morphine and provided him with the material\r\n     for morphine injection after leaving the hospital. Then began the\r\n     usual story. He became more and more dependent upon his injection,\r\n     the dose was steadily increased, he found unscrupulous physicians\r\n     who yielded to his demand for morphine prescriptions; he lost his\r\n     position with the railway by the growing effects of the morphine\r\n     poisoning, he became divorced, sank lower and lower, his daily dose\r\n     fluctuating between thirty-five and forty grains a day, and when he\r\n     came to me, he presented a picture of the lowest type of hopeless\r\n     manhood. He spent practically the whole day in bed and was only\r\n     able to totter slowly along with a cane. He assured me that life\r\n     was hell for him. He could not sleep, he could not eat, he could\r\n     not think, he had made up his mind to commit suicide if I could not\r\n     help him. I foresaw that it would in the best case demand months of\r\n     insistent energy to make a man out of that unfortunate wreck. He\r\n     had gone through three different morphine cures in three\r\n     sanitariums and none had helped him, and every physician whom he\r\n     had consulted had declared his case as beyond any physical cure. I\r\n     decided to make the somewhat disproportionate sacrifice of time in\r\n     order to study whether even such an extreme case of morphinism is\r\n     accessible to psychotherapeutic treatment. Four months later, he\r\n     left my laboratory looking like an athlete, strong and vigorous,\r\n     joyful and energetic. For three weeks he had not received any\r\n     morphine, had good appetite, slept well, and had happily married.\r\n     As his wife was a trained nurse, she will take good care that no\r\n     new slip shall ever occur.\r\n\r\n     There was nothing remarkable in those four months of treatment. He\r\n     was easily hypnotized, and I hypnotized him at first every day,\r\n     then every second day, then every week. It was without difficulty\r\n     that I reduced the forty grains to about six grains a day. Then the\r\n     struggle began. To test the case as a strictly psychological\r\n     problem I left the effort entirely to his own will, that is, I did\r\n     not deprive him of the morphine supply but left the regulation in\r\n     his own hands. During that whole winter he had a bottle with a\r\n     thousand morphine tablets standing on his desk. Thus he would have\r\n     been entirely able to satisfy any craving, but by his own will he\r\n     followed my suggestions and never took more than I permitted. It\r\n     meant a terrible struggle. The tortures which he had to pass\r\n     through were perhaps worse than those which he had experienced at\r\n     the time of his lowest downfall. They came to a focus when he tried\r\n     to go from five grains to three grains a day and then again when\r\n     he approached half a grain. From there he had to move to a fourth\r\n     of a grain, then to an eighth, and even that had still to be\r\n     divided into four different doses which were then reduced to three,\r\n     to two, and finally to one dose and ultimately to injections of\r\n     warm water. A rapid increase in general strength and a return of\r\n     appetite for food began when he had reached the five grain limit. I\r\n     did not allow on any occasion the introduction of a substitute. On\r\n     the other hand, I added every day suggestions covering the various\r\n     secondary symptoms, especially the pains in the stomach and the\r\n     feelings of faintness and the emotional depression.\r\n\r\nThere, is no doubt that under favorable conditions, especially if the\r\ndose of morphine is not too strong, autosuggestion can bring about a\r\nsimilar effect. A reduction of ten per cent every week can be carried\r\nthrough, if a pledge is given to one's self in a drowsy state. The great\r\nvalue of autosuggestion showed itself not seldom in the fact that\r\nmorphinists who had applied to me by mail for a cure in the mistaken\r\nbelief that I do work in a professional way for payment and who got from\r\nme a written reply that I could not receive them, but that they can help\r\nthemselves, wrote to me that my letter gave them strength to reduce\r\ntheir dose considerably.\r\n\r\nQuite similar is the situation with cocainism or with the combination of\r\nmorphine and cocaine which is so frequent nowadays with young\r\nphysicians. I have repeatedly seen cures where the case already gave the\r\nimpression of insanity. Again I give a rather extreme case.\r\n\r\n     A physician had acquired the habit of using and misusing cocaine\r\n     for the treatment of a disease of his nose. The habit grew to a\r\n     craving for cocaine while the cocaine itself poisoned the brain.\r\n     Acoustical hallucinations began; he heard voices from every corner\r\n     of the room, and on the street the voices took persecutory\r\n     character. He connected them with his brother living in Europe,\r\n     heard his voice in the denunciations, and developed a pathological\r\n     system of ideas around the central thought that his brother had a\r\n     telepathic influence on him. His reason succumbed, he lost all\r\n     consciousness of delusion, and believed himself really to be under\r\n     the control of the absent brother. When he came to me he had been\r\n     without sleep and without food for several days, and he was not\r\n     seeking my help to get rid of the mental disturbance but to\r\n     overcome the power of his older brother. He did not connect the\r\n     fear at all with his misuse of cocaine. When I discovered the rôle\r\n     which the cocaine played, I determined to try the suggestive\r\n     influence, the more as I found that he was in a half-hypnotic state\r\n     as soon as he had entered my room. I suggested to him to sleep and\r\n     to take food and to reduce the cocaine dose by a fourth. The next\r\n     day he was an entirely different man by the effect of ten hours'\r\n     sleep and a large breakfast. Now I concentrated my efforts on the\r\n     reduction of the cocaine. After ten days of hypnotic treatment he\r\n     gave up cocaine entirely, after three weeks the voices disappeared\r\n     and slowly the other symptoms faded away. The pathological idea of\r\n     the telepathic influence lasted a while after the voices had gone\r\n     until this idea, too, yielded to suggestion. It still took six\r\n     weeks before he himself felt that he was entirely normal.\r\n\r\nThe way in which the average physician nowadays neglects the simple tool\r\nof suggestive treatment, when it can be used for the protection of\r\nsociety, is perhaps nowhere so reckless as in the case of the morphinist\r\nand cocainist. To give a typical case of this neglect I may mention that\r\nof a highly intelligent young man who had been in the habit of using\r\nboth cocaine and morphine for ten years when at his own request he was\r\nsent to a New York hospital. He had been taking alternately morphine for\r\na year or two, then cocaine for a year or two, and had sometimes\r\nalternated and sometimes combined both in an irregular way. When he\r\nentered the hospital in May, 1908, he was in a cocaine period and was\r\ntaking the enormous dose of one hundred and eighty grains of cocaine\r\nevery day. In the hospital they withdrew the drug altogether. During the\r\nfirst weeks, he was entirely sleepless. They energetically refused him\r\nany substitutes and after six weeks he began to feel comfortable. He\r\ngained steadily in weight and after three months, when he left, he had\r\ngained fifty pounds, felt entirely comfortable, and seemed in all\r\nrespects normal again. Before twelve hours had passed after leaving the\r\nhospital, he had again taken thirty grains of cocaine and ten grains of\r\nmorphine, and this dose rapidly grew until after a few weeks it again\r\nreached a hundred grains of cocaine and up to sixty grains of morphine a\r\nday. Then came the complete breakdown. If that man in the last two or\r\nthree weeks of the hospital treatment, when he felt entirely comfortable\r\nand normal and had gained his normal weight, had received even a slight\r\nsuggestive treatment suppressing any desire for cocaine or morphine, he\r\nwould easily have been saved. To let such a man after a drug career of\r\nten years go out again to the places of his old associations, where the\r\ndesire had to be stirred up, is inexcusable at a time when\r\npsychotherapeutics has won its triumphs in this field. It might have\r\nbeen sufficient to give him preventive treatment at least for the first\r\nthree days of his freedom. And such a case is typical of hundreds.\r\n\r\nThe overstrong impulse and overstrong desire finds its counterpart in\r\nthe abnormal lack of energy and lack of attention. The patient--and it\r\nis especially the neurasthenic patient--has lost his usual strength, he\r\nshrinks from every undertaking, he cannot decide upon any action, he\r\nneeds a disproportionate effort for the smallest task, and cannot\r\nconcentrate his attention in spite of his best will. The varieties of\r\nthis lack of power and inertia are familiar to every physician. They\r\ncertainly often need much more than merely psychotherapeutic treatment,\r\nalthough on the physical side no schematic method is admissible. The\r\nlaziness of the anæmic needs a different treatment from the laziness of\r\nthe exhausted but in every case psychological factors can be of decisive\r\ninfluence, whatever the physical and chemical treatment besides them may\r\nbe. A few letters may again illustrate the varieties. Here again there\r\nis no sharp demarcation line between the normal and the abnormal.\r\nLetters like the two following, for instance, are hardly letters of\r\npatients. They show a variation which is still entirely within normal\r\nlimits and yet a source of suffering; it is a disturbance which usually\r\ncan be removed by psychotherapeutic means.\r\n\r\n     \"I do almost everything with effort, nothing spontaneously. I have\r\n     been writing for five years but am a mood writer of the worst type.\r\n     The mood comes at such uncertain times that I seem to be absolutely\r\n     at the mercy of caprice. This might not in itself be a misfortune\r\n     but writing is my only calling and I suffer the proverbial torments\r\n     of lost spirits when I am idle. The necessity of driving myself to\r\n     every piece of work, aggravated by the fact that my parents allowed\r\n     my constitutional inertness to have full play, has hitherto\r\n     prevented me from forming any regular habit of labor. I am now\r\n     thirty-eight. Would you suppose that if I kept my nose to the\r\n     grindstone for one, two or three years, I might yet hope to work\r\n     with some ease and regularity? That is, if I compelled myself to\r\n     write a certain number of hours every day as a discipline,\r\n     regardless of the quality of matter I produce, is there any\r\n     probability that I might ultimately overcome the fearful paralysis\r\n     that so often grips my faculties? Can constitutional indolence be\r\n     overcome by determination? I put in a little time on a couch every\r\n     day. When worried I get neurasthenia and all kinds of phobias. Just\r\n     now I am afraid to look at the newspapers on account of the cholera\r\n     in St. Petersburg, and I have seen the time when I found it\r\n     difficult to drink water after I had boiled it myself.\"\r\n\r\nAlso the next man is familiar to all of us.\r\n\r\n     \"Plainly we are told every man is born into the world to fill some\r\n     purpose, or at least be of some benefit to himself or his\r\n     fellowmen. For some reason I do not make friends among men. I have\r\n     not the zeal or ambition to carry or even begin a conversation\r\n     that will interest the individual man. I worry a great deal. I have\r\n     never been able to concentrate my mind to study and figure out\r\n     problems. I can read them zealously but apparently do not get to\r\n     the bottom and cannot retain what I do read. If I could just get\r\n     hold of the power of thinking and dig out that tangible something\r\n     that holds me back, I could go forward and make myself what I know\r\n     I should be. But I feel that so far I am a total failure. If I only\r\n     had that one great gift, the power of concentration and will power,\r\n     I would make what I so much desire, a success of myself.\"\r\n\r\nA similar effect and yet psychologically a different condition exists\r\nwhere the lack of energy results from the suggestive power of the\r\nopposite, producing a constant indecision.\r\n\r\n     \"I am thirty years old and nearly all my life since childhood I\r\n     have been fearfully troubled with the habit of indecision and\r\n     regretting whatever I do. It has grown into a habit so fixed that\r\n     at times I am fearful of losing my mind. I feel anxious to do\r\n     something and decide to do it, then as soon as it is done, I nearly\r\n     go wild with regrets until I have to undo it, if possible, and then\r\n     only to regret that. I am this way about the most trifling things\r\n     and about the most serious. I can't perform any duty well. In\r\n     business and in social affairs, it is always with me. It has me in\r\n     its clutches, a horrible monster dragging me down. My friends\r\n     misinterpret me and wonder what I mean by doing so when all the\r\n     time I want to do what is for the best and cannot for this tyrant\r\n     who is ever present with me. I will plod for hours and hours at a\r\n     time, and at every turn I am handicapped. I am intelligent\r\n     naturally and appear a perfect fool.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the report of such chronic cases we may turn to the acute ones.\r\nHere a characteristic letter of, a typical neurasthenic young modern\r\npoet.\r\n\r\n     \"These are my plans but I hardly think that I can carry them\r\n     through, although perhaps you can help me by suggestion. I have the\r\n     feeling that through the whole of last year my development did not\r\n     go forward but backward. It is as if by a mental or physical\r\n     overstrain, my whole personality has entered into a transition. I\r\n     have no joy in life, no sensation in love, no satisfaction in\r\n     labor. My will has become weak where it was strong. I am lazy, up\r\n     to an absolute dislike of everything, while I have been energy\r\n     itself. Often I have only the one desire, to end my life from mere\r\n     fatigue. If there had been any external reason for ending my life,\r\n     I should perhaps have done it long ago. I am so apathetic that I no\r\n     longer take myself seriously. My successes do not please me; the\r\n     idea of writing anything gives me anxiety. I have become less\r\n     resisting, more sweet, more soft, I should almost like to say, more\r\n     feminine. I became infatuated with a girl, simply because I knew\r\n     that she hates all men. The inaccessible is still the only thing\r\n     which can stimulate me somewhat. I have even written a poem on her,\r\n     but nothing can satisfy me in love. I consider my state a disease\r\n     of the will as a result of nervous exhaustion. I must find some one\r\n     who, with kindly power, reënforces my will system. I need a strong\r\n     mind--it may be a man or a woman. It would even be possible in the\r\n     latter case that I might marry her.\r\n\r\n     \"Even the writing of this letter has fatigued me so much that I\r\n     should like best to sleep. In moments like the present I should\r\n     like best to throw myself down on the street or ... quickly ...\r\n     sink ... into the ocean. (I regret having made the little points.\r\n     They look as if my expressions are a pose.) Yet there are moods in\r\n     which I am entirely normal and no one fancies what I am passing\r\n     through. I have even become superstitious lately. Are there perhaps\r\n     beings which can absorb our energy? Perhaps another being has drunk\r\n     up my energy.\"\r\n\r\nAuthors run easily into such states. Here is another.\r\n\r\n     \"I am a neurasthenic, and I am beginning to believe, a professional\r\n     one. My object in writing is to ask concerning the advisability of\r\n     my visiting you for treatment. I am ready to take the next train if\r\n     you say the word, if you believe you can help me. It seems that the\r\n     regular practitioner, who is very irregular, cannot. If there is\r\n     one good doctor I have not consulted, I would like to know his\r\n     name. I was doing editorial work in X and broke down. Still the\r\n     doctor said that if I liked my work, I should go back to it and\r\n     pitch in. I did. It lasted a few days and then I had to give up\r\n     altogether, couldn't grind out another word. Then to another\r\n     doctor----also the best in the city. He told me to give up all\r\n     work, which I did, and then I went on a farm for six months. That\r\n     did not help me either. Later I went west and spent some time in\r\n     the mountains. I felt no better there. Then I went to Arizona and\r\n     lived in a tent out on the desert; that did not help me. There was\r\n     always a sensation of exhaustion and any physical exertion put me\r\n     on my back, even when it was light and pleasant exercise. Then I\r\n     went to California; it did me little good. It is a perfect paradise\r\n     for anyone who has not got neurasthenia. I still have not got\r\n     myself in hand. I cannot do or say or write just what I wish, and\r\n     cannot concentrate my thoughts. To try to read a book is punishment\r\n     because I forget as fast as I read.\" And so on.\r\n\r\n     I answered him certainly not to come but tried to induce some\r\n     autosuggestions. A few weeks later, he wrote me: \"Ever since you\r\n     wrote me, I am now feeling somewhat improved.\" Yet I cannot judge\r\n     how far the improvement belonged to the psychical factor only,\r\n     inasmuch as I had advised him also to take some bromides. The\r\n     really effective treatment would have been heterosuggestion and I\r\n     had no time to enter into the case.\r\n\r\nWhere direct suggestion is used, the effect is often surprising.\r\n\r\n     A young lawyer after a period of overwork had come to a state of\r\n     complete lack of energy. He could not find strength to write a\r\n     letter and he came to me at a day when he did not see any way but\r\n     suicide open for himself. He complained that, as soon as he began\r\n     to grasp a thought, it was evaporating. He stared absently about\r\n     the room and felt sure that he would never again achieve anything.\r\n     He had not even the energy to read the newspaper. I hypnotized him\r\n     three times, each time waking in him the pleasure in a definite\r\n     piece of work, at first simply in a novel which he was to read,\r\n     then in some letters which he was to write, and then in his\r\n     professional work. There was always an interval of three days. The\r\n     fourth time he declared himself that the hypnotic influence was\r\n     unnecessary, as he felt that he was again in the midst of his work.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the effect is a much slower one, but if all personal factors\r\nare well considered and especially physical disturbances are excluded,\r\nthe result is usually satisfactory.\r\n\r\nVery different from such neurasthenics, of course, is the lack of\r\nattention in the feeble-minded, and suggestion of the ordinary type is\r\nhardly advisable, but it is surprising how much can be reached by a\r\nsystematic psychical régime. I give one typical instance, representative\r\nof many.\r\n\r\n     A boy of twelve years when he was brought to me showed the mental\r\n     powers of a stupid child of four. In a silly way he repeated every\r\n     question which he heard without answering it; he talked steadily to\r\n     himself in a nonsensical manner, mostly repeating nursery rhymes\r\n     without end, never holding his attention to anything in the room,\r\n     giving the impression that there was no attention whatever. The boy\r\n     was a child of rich parents; he had his own teachers, but was for a\r\n     large part of the year under the influence of the parents only, who\r\n     very naturally yielded to every desire of the unfortunate child. I\r\n     insisted on a complete change of the education. It was my effort to\r\n     build up the mind by a rigorous training and by development of the\r\n     power of inhibition. I absolutely forbade any meaningless material\r\n     like the nursery rhymes, insisted that the child should never be\r\n     allowed to talk to himself, and whenever he began to speak to\r\n     himself he was to be addressed sharply, and if he yet went on, to\r\n     be slapped on his hands. In the same way he was not allowed to\r\n     repeat a question, but the question was repeated until he answered\r\n     it, the question always formulated in simple words. He was forced\r\n     to go through simple reading and writing without being allowed to\r\n     make his silly diversions. His whole life was brought under strict\r\n     discipline and no parental indulgence was permitted. Six months\r\n     later the child was completely changed. It seemed as if he had gone\r\n     through an improvement of three years. I regulated the whole of\r\n     his elementary studies in accordance with the successful principle.\r\n     The training of inhibition stood in the foreground and every\r\n     haphazard reaction was severely rebuked. The summer vacations spent\r\n     with the parents in the fashionable surroundings, to be sure, had\r\n     always a retarding influence, but the main part of the year in\r\n     which it was possible to carry through the strict discipline showed\r\n     such steady and inspiring progress that the boy, while of course\r\n     feeble-minded for life, can yet live externally a harmonious life.\r\n\r\nA systematic training of the power of inhibition is indeed the\r\nfundamental factor in all psychotherapeutic treatment when the\r\ndisturbance is in the volitional sphere, but the inhibition is secured\r\nmost safely by reënforcement of the antagonistic attitude. From these\r\nvolitional variations on the one side, from the ideational disturbances\r\non the other, only a few steps lead to those dissociations of the\r\npersonality which are characteristic of many graver cases of hysteria.\r\nBut to give to them any adequate analysis, it would be insufficient to\r\nrefer in this brief way to particular cases. Psychopathological\r\nliterature possesses some excellent analyses of such complex\r\ndisturbances. As I said before, I abstain entirely here from such\r\ncomplex phenomena, as they enter too seldom into the sphere of the\r\npractitioner and as the bewildering manifoldness of their symptoms does\r\nnot allow us so easily to recognize the fundamental principles which\r\nalone were to be illustrated by our short survey of practical cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nTHE BODILY SYMPTOMS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe discussion of the bodily symptoms which may yield to\r\npsychotherapeutic treatment, naturally forms only a short appendix to\r\nour discussion of the mental symptoms. Our interest was from the\r\nbeginning essentially a psychological one. I shall have to be the more\r\nbrief as my personal experience in the treatment of bodily diseases\r\nthrough mental therapy is entirely secondary and accidental. The\r\npsychological laboratory would, of course, be an entirely unfit place to\r\nstruggle with diseases of which the chief symptoms are not\r\npsychophysical. Yet in spite of frequent testimonies of well-known\r\nphysicians to the contrary, I am still inclined to think that this is\r\nalso the situation at large. I think that in medicine in general the\r\npsychophysical effect of mental treatment is by far more important and\r\nby far more extended than the healing effect on diseased peripheral\r\norgans. Of course these peripheral parts of the body may be favorably\r\ninfluenced in an indirect way by the mental treatment; we shall have to\r\ntake notice of this important result but that is strictly not a\r\ntherapeutic effect on the bodily symptoms. Moreover, purely psychical\r\neffects may give an impression as if the bodily symptom itself has been\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nTo begin with the latter case, it is especially the inhibition of pain\r\nwhich easily makes one believe that a bodily disturbance is successfully\r\ntreated. I have repeatedly seen cases in which I tried by suggestion to\r\nsoften the pain resulting from a peripheral disturbance like\r\ninflammations, rheumatism, decayed teeth and so on. The effect was often\r\nsuch a total disappearance of the pain that the patient himself was\r\ninclined to believe that the objective disease had been ended, while in\r\nreality the state of the diseased organ was not changed at all. It has\r\noften happened that I tried to cure a person of certain mental symptoms\r\nby suggestion, ignoring entirely the existence of some pain resulting\r\nfrom a bodily disease with which I had nothing to do. Yet the suggestion\r\nof improvement seemed almost to irradiate and the pain disappeared in\r\nspite of having been ignored by the hypnotizer. For instance, I treated\r\na woman who suffered from psychasthenic obsessions, fearing all the time\r\nthat something would happen to her child. I did not give any direct\r\nattention to the fact that she had had for years a painful disease of\r\nthe bladder for which she was constantly treated by a specialist. But\r\nwhile I did not mention the bladder in my hypnotic suggestion, yet the\r\nabdominal pain disappeared together with the obsession and the situation\r\nmight easily have suggested that the bladder trouble was a nervous one\r\nwhich had been cured by the hypnotic sleep. The fact was that the\r\nbladder disease was not influenced by the mental treatment at all, and\r\nneeded a continuation of the same local treatment. It was only the\r\npsychophysical pain in the brain which had been inhibited.\r\n\r\nQuite parallel to the disappearance of the organic pain sensation is the\r\narising of a general feeling of improvement. This organic sensation of\r\ngeneral betterment may again be a strictly mental occurrence without any\r\nobjective reference to a real improvement in the bodily conditions. Yet\r\nagain that easily gives the impression of an important change in the\r\nbodily conditions themselves. The miraculous cures of various diseases\r\nthrough mystic agencies generally belong to this category. There is no\r\ndoubt that often the migrating charlatans who advertise themselves by a\r\nfree treatment of the sick and invalids on the theater stage of small\r\ntowns, produce momentary effects which are sufficient to deceive. The\r\nquack handles the diseased organ, perhaps a goiter or a leg crippled by\r\nrheumatism, with a cruel rudeness and overwhelms the suggestible mind so\r\ncompletely that the first autosuggestion is that of a complete change,\r\nand that means cure. The disastrous results follow later. But from such\r\nbarbarisms we come by gradual steps to the suggestion of improvement\r\nwhere the feeling of betterment can be in itself an important factor for\r\nthe cure. Yet even there we must not mistake the possible secondary\r\neffect of a mental change from a psychotherapeutic cure of the bodily\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nNot seldom the removal of physical disability seems secured as soon as\r\ncertain mental disturbances are removed. There is no reason to believe\r\nfor instance that suggestion can have an important influence on a\r\ndiseased sense organ, and yet hypnotic influence and even autosuggestive\r\ninfluence can under certain circumstances greatly improve seeing and\r\nhearing. Especially in the field of hearing the central factor is of\r\nenormous importance. Hyperæmic and anæmic conditions in the brain\r\ncenters of hearing control the vividness of the received sound. The\r\npatient who cannot hear a certain watch more than one foot distant may\r\nbe able to hear it after some glasses of wine at a distance of three or\r\nfour feet. Thus it is only natural that a hypnotic influence can produce\r\nsimilar changes on the psychophysical centers in such cases in which the\r\nsource of the trouble is a psychophysical laziness in the acoustical\r\ncenter. Sometimes even this laziness itself is the result of psychical\r\nautosuggestion which can be fought by counter-suggestion. I saw, for\r\ninstance, a distinct improvement in hearing in the case of a young woman\r\nwho had increasing deafness while the aurists declared that the ears\r\nwere in proper condition. I found that she lived with a father who\r\nsuffered from a severe middle-ear catarrh and that she was simply\r\ncontrolled by a hidden fear that she might have inherited the ear\r\ndisease of her father. I removed this fear, partly by reasoning, partly\r\nby suggestion, and partly by tricks which surprised her, for instance,\r\nmaking her hear her watch with unaccustomed strength when she took it\r\nbetween her teeth and closed both ears. The autosuggestive fear was\r\nuprooted by these and the central ear organs slowly came to normal\r\nfunctioning.\r\n\r\nThe purely psychical character is still more evident in the frequent\r\nhysterical anæsthesias. No one doubts that here the sensations are\r\ninhibited only and that the mental influence removes this inhibition\r\nwithout any influence on the sense organs proper. Frequently also\r\norganic troubles like stomach diseases appear cured when in reality\r\nhysterical disturbances are at the bottom. The stomach may be sensitive\r\nto any pressure and may produce severe pains and vomiting on taking any\r\nfood and everything may indicate a serious local disturbance. Yet\r\nhypnotic treatment may quickly remove the symptoms because the whole\r\nreaction may have resulted from the shock which perhaps a too hot piece\r\nof potato caused. The removal of this mental starting point results in a\r\ncure of the apparent stomach disease. Again in other cases, the\r\nappearance of a physical cure is given by the creation of psychophysical\r\nsubstitutes. I do not believe that hypnotism or suggestive treatment can\r\ninfluence the brain parts which have suffered from a hemorrhage. Yet the\r\nparalysis of the arm, for instance, which resulted from such a breaking\r\nof a blood-vessel in the brain may be to a high degree repaired by\r\nbuilding up new motor images in the psychophysical system, which become\r\nstarting points for a new learning of movements. The patient did not\r\nunderstand how to make the most out of those motor paths which had been\r\nleft. The destruction of the chief channels of discharge had inhibited\r\nin his mind the idea of possible movement. He no longer believes that he\r\ncan move and it needs new suggestions to overcome this inhibition. The\r\ncurative effect on bodily disabilities is thus often an illusory one.\r\n\r\nThat does not mean that the field in which psychotherapeutics may work\r\ndirectly on the body is not after all a large and interesting one.\r\nTheoretically it is still little open to real understanding. The\r\nexplanation has essentially to rest on the acceptance of a given\r\nphysiological apparatus. A certain psychophysical excitement produces by\r\nexisting nerve connections a certain effect, for instance, on the\r\nblood-vessels or on the glands of a certain region, or on a certain\r\nlower nervous center. That such apparatus exists, the physiological\r\nexperiment with persons who are hypnotized to a high degree can easily\r\ndemonstrate. Their nose bleeds at a command; a blister may arise on a\r\npart of the skin which is simply covered with a penny, when the\r\nsuggestion is given that the penny is glowing hot. With some subjects,\r\nthe pulse can become slower and quicker in accordance with the\r\nsuggestion; with some even the bodily temperature can change on order.\r\nOur understanding of these indubitable facts indeed does not go further\r\nthan the acknowledgment that the paths for such central connections\r\nexist. That means we simply describe the facts once more in the terms of\r\nanatomy. But after all in the same way we rely on the nervous\r\nconnections, if a thought makes us blush and ultimately if our will\r\nmoves our arm or if our ideas move our speech apparatus. We do not\r\nchoose the muscles of our arm, we hardly know them; we know still less\r\nin speaking, of the movements of our vocal cords, and in blushing of the\r\ndilated blood-vessels. That ideas work on the lower centers of our\r\ncentral nervous system, centers which regulate the actions of our\r\nmuscles and blood-vessels and glands, must simply be accepted as the\r\nmachinery of our physiological theory. The connection of such theories\r\nwith purely physical facts is given by the experience that an electrical\r\nstimulation of the nerve may have the same influence as ideas. The\r\nelectric current, too, can regulate the beat of the heart, or contract\r\nand dilate the vessels, or reënforce and relax the contraction of the\r\nmuscles, or strengthen and weaken the functions of the glands.\r\n\r\nNearest to the psychophysical processes stands the bodily symptom of\r\ninsomnia. There is no doubt possible that the work of the\r\npsychotherapist can be very beneficial in producing sleep by suggestion.\r\nThat autosuggestions for sleep play an important rôle is popularly\r\naccepted. Next to the most immediate means such as lying down, or\r\ncutting off sense stimuli, or trying not to think, or avoiding\r\nmovements, certainly the most well known factor is the expectation of\r\nsleep with the belief that sleep will come. This belief may be\r\nreënforced to strong autosuggestion which may then overcome other\r\nfactors that hinder sleep. For instance, I have repeatedly received\r\nletters from strangers containing expressions of gratitude with news\r\nwhich under other circumstances would at least not flatter an author.\r\nThey wrote to me that immediately after reading one or another essay of\r\nmine on hypnotism, they fell into deep sleep. Yet as they were always\r\npatients who had suffered from insomnia, I was pleased with this\r\nunintended effect of my writings. But in most cases a real cure demands\r\nheterosuggestion.\r\n\r\nThere is room for any variety of effects; often they enter immediately.\r\nThe other day I gave sleep suggestion to a young woman who had\r\noverworked herself in literary production. For months she had not slept\r\nmore than three or four hours a night and even that only after taking\r\nnarcotics. I intentionally did not allow her to come into a hypnotic\r\nsleep but kept her fully awake, increasing her suggestibility while her\r\neyes were wide open. I suggested to her to take a walk, then to eat her\r\ndinner, and after that to go to bed at once. She went to bed at seven\r\no'clock and slept without waking until ten o'clock the next morning, and\r\nafter fifteen hours' sleep she was like a different being. A regular\r\neight hour sleep is sometimes secured, even where no immediate direction\r\nhas been given for it. On the other hand, I cannot deny that I have\r\nsometimes been entirely unsuccessful in securing better sleep by the\r\nfirst three hypnotic treatments. When the first three treatments were\r\nunsuccessful, I always gave it up on account of lack of time. Yet the\r\nexperience of others shows that in such cases, often after a long\r\ncontinued hypnotic treatment insomnia yields to suggestion. One of the\r\ngreat factors which work against the mental treatment is the habit of so\r\nmany sufferers of relying on their sleeping powders which, to be sure,\r\nremain effective only by increasing the dose and thus finally by making\r\nthem dangerous. Every chemical narcotic has in itself suggestive power\r\nand strengthens the belief of the sleep-seeker that he cannot find rest\r\nwithout his dose. To overcome the monopoly of the opiates is one of the\r\nmost important functions of psychotherapy.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that the relations of psychotherapy to sleep show\r\nsuch a great variety. The factors which coöperate in normal sleep are\r\nmany and the disturbance can have very different character. We had to\r\nspeak of the psychophysics of sleep when we discussed the theoretical\r\nrelation of sleep to hypnotism and insisted that it is misleading to\r\nconsider hypnosis simply as partial sleep. We claimed a fundamental\r\ndifference between the selective inhibition in hypnotism and the general\r\nreduction of functions in sleep. To understand sleep, we have to\r\nrecognize it as one of the fundamental instincts, comparable with the\r\ninstinct for food or for sexual satisfaction. Every one of such\r\ninstincts has a circular character. Mental processes, subcortical\r\nprocesses, and physical effects are involved in such a way that each\r\nreënforces the others. The physical effect of the sleep instinct,\r\ncomparable with the pepsin secretion in the food instinct, or with the\r\nhyperæmia of the sexual organs in the sexual instinct, is a change in\r\nthe cortex by which the sensory and motor brain centers are put out of\r\naction. What kind of a change that is, is quite indifferent. It may be a\r\nchemical one but more probably it is a circulatory one. Let us say it is\r\na contraction of blood-vessels which by the resulting anæmia makes the\r\nsensory centers unfit for perception and the motor centers unfit for\r\naction. In this way the brain becomes protected by sleep against the\r\ndemands of the surroundings. The mental reactions are eliminated and the\r\ncentral nervous substance has an opportunity to build itself up. This\r\nprotective physical activity is now evidently itself controlled by a\r\nsubcortical center, just as secretion and sexual hyperæmia are\r\ncontrolled. This center probably lies in the medulla oblongata.\r\n\r\nSome theorists, to be sure, are inclined to think that the fatigued\r\nbrain cells enter directly through their exhaustion into the protective\r\nsleep state. But that simplifies the situation too much. It is quite\r\ntrue, as these theorists claim, that monotonous stimulation of the\r\nsenses produces sleep. But it is evident that the sleep occurs even then\r\nnot only in the particular overtired brain cells. A monotonous\r\nstimulation of the acoustical center raises the threshold of perception\r\nfor all the senses and brings sleep to the whole brain. This control of\r\nthe whole apparatus is thus surely regulated by one definite center. But\r\nthis lower center, which controls the anæmia of the cortex, is itself\r\ndirectly dependent again upon a mental condition, the mental experience\r\nof fatigue. The fatigue sensation, which is possibly the result of toxic\r\nprocesses, works on that lower sleep center, just as the appetizing\r\nimpression or the sensual images work on the centers of the other two\r\ninstincts. On the other hand this protective blood-vessel contraction\r\ncreates again as in the other cases a characteristic organic sensation,\r\nthe sensation of rest which arises when the threshold of perception and\r\nactivity is raised. The world begins to appear dim and far away, no\r\nimpulse for action excites us. This organic feeling of rest associates\r\nitself with the fatigue feeling. The fatigue sensation, the subcortical\r\nsleep center, the contraction of the vessels in the cortex, and finally\r\nthe rest sensation form together the complete circle. The difficulty\r\nwhich arises in this case lies only in the fact that the cortex gone to\r\nsleep annihilates also, of course, the fatigue sensation and the rest\r\nsensation. For that reason the real circle can appear only in the\r\npreparatory stages of sleep. As soon as sleep itself sets in, the circle\r\nis broken. The circle character of every instinct must lead the physical\r\neffect upward to a higher and higher degree. Not to become excessive,\r\nthe physical effect must be checked somehow. In all other spheres, it\r\nfinds its end in satisfaction, for instance, by eating or by the sexual\r\nact. In sleep the circular process ends automatically by its own effect\r\nas soon as complete sleep is reached. Its causes, the fatigue and the\r\nrest feeling, are stopped, as soon as the effect, the anæmia, is\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\nWe see now how widely different starting points can lead to sleep and\r\ncan understand from it how widely different disturbances can prevent\r\nsleep. Sleep must result when fatigue is coming, but sleep must also\r\nresult when the elements of the rest feeling are produced, and as we saw\r\nthat the components of the rest feeling were the sensations of decreased\r\nsensitiveness and decreased activity, sleep must result when either the\r\nsensations and associations are absent and actions are suppressed, or\r\nwhen monotonous sensations and automatic actions raise the threshold.\r\nSleep must arise further if our will associates the mere idea of such\r\nrest, and finally physical or chemical means may produce a sleep\r\nbringing effect either on the lower center or on the blood-vessels and\r\ncells of the cortex. Correspondingly sleep may be prevented by\r\ndisturbances in any one of these spheres. There may be no normal\r\nfatigue, there may be no fatigue sensation, there may be no rest feeling\r\non account of perceptions, or on account of associations, or on account\r\nof impulses to action; there may be no normal response in the\r\nsubcortical center, there may be no physical effect in the cortex on\r\naccount of an existing hyperæmia or on account of an abnormal condition\r\nof the cells. The psychotherapeutic treatment must carefully analyze\r\nwhich element would be fit to supply the last link in the circular\r\nchain. Sometimes we need the suggestion of fatigue, sometimes the\r\ninhibition of ideas, sometimes the suppression of impulses, sometimes\r\nthe suggestion of rest, and so on. A mere general suggestion of sleep is\r\non the whole effective only in the cases of those persons in whom this\r\nidea in itself awakens those various components. Very often it is\r\nentirely ineffective in this general form. Sometimes it is possible to\r\ncarry the hypnotic state itself directly over into sleep, but it seems\r\nmore in the interest of the patient to separate those two states\r\ndistinctly.\r\n\r\nWe are still confined to processes in the brain itself if we turn to\r\nheadache. If it were only a question of inhibiting the pain by mental\r\nsuggestion, the case would not be different from inhibiting the pain of\r\na peripheral organ without attempting to cure the diseased organ itself.\r\nBut in the case of headaches, it seems justified to claim that in\r\ncertain varieties of this multifold symptom, not only the pain is\r\nsuppressed but the disturbance itself is removed. Especially where the\r\nheadache seems to result from hyperæmia, the trouble seems to be\r\naccessible to psychotherapeutics. On the other hand I have never seen\r\nany lasting effect on the so-called sick headache or migraine. While\r\ncontinuous headaches or headaches which occur daily yielded to my\r\ninfluence, sometimes completely, I was unable to prevent even by\r\npreparatory hypnotization any migraine which appears periodically, for\r\ninstance, simultaneously with menstruation.\r\n\r\nA few words only as to the general diseases and disturbances for which a\r\nvery strong therapeutic effect has been claimed by masters of the craft\r\nlike Wetterstrand, Moll, Dubois, and others. From my own experience I\r\ncan affirm the often lasting effect in the disturbances of the functions\r\nof the digestive apparatus. The stomach and the intestines seem to a\r\nhigh degree under nervous influences which can be changed through\r\nhypnotic suggestion. If we consider what intimate connection exists\r\nbetween the functions of these organs and the normal emotions, it seems\r\nhardly surprising that mental factors can regulate their disturbances.\r\nVomiting, diarrhea, and especially constipation, often yield to slight\r\nsuggestions, even in a superficial hypnotic state. Here, too, I have\r\nseen repeatedly a complete regulation of a long-standing disturbance as\r\nan unintended by-product of hypnotic suggestion directed towards the\r\ncure of psychical troubles. Much value is claimed for hypnotic method in\r\nthe treatment of anæmic conditions. It is said that anæmia improves\r\nafter a few hypnotic treatments, the appetite becomes better, the cold\r\nhands and feet grow warmer, the headaches disappear, the capacity for\r\nwork increases rapidly, and most surprising of all the leucorrhea\r\nceases. As to heart disease, we ought to think in the first place of the\r\ndisturbances of nervous innervation. I have seen repeatedly a remarkable\r\ndecrease of nervous palpitation of the heart through direct mental\r\ninfluence, abstracting here from the secondary effect of suppressing\r\nmental excitement and fear. Where organic heart diseases are surely\r\npresent, it seems that hypnotism can sometimes act beneficially if the\r\nheart trouble is accompanied by anæmia and general debility; of course a\r\ndeveloped valvular disease cannot be removed. In the same way it seems\r\nthat in Bright's disease, certain painful symptoms may be suppressed,\r\nbut the kidneys certainly cannot be influenced. At least open to\r\nserious suspicion are the insistent claims that diabetes can be cured by\r\nsuggestion. Dr. Quackenbos of New York, for instance, gives to some of\r\nhis diabetes patients a hypnotic suggestion by the following words: \"If\r\nyour pancreas be crippled in its production of the natural ferment which\r\nis given off to blood and lymph and which conditions the normal\r\ncondition of sugar in the body or restrains the output of sugar from the\r\nliver tissues, you will see that it forthwith pours into your blood or\r\nlymph the sufficient quantity of sugar oxidizing ferments.\" It certainly\r\ntranscends our present understanding if we are to believe that a\r\nsuggestion of this type will change the action of the pancreas. It is\r\nhardly worth while to enter into the still more extravagant claims from\r\nother sides like those for curing cancer and phthisis. On the other\r\nhand, in the light of all that we have discussed, there is no difficulty\r\nin understanding the easily observable influence in the regulation of\r\nmenstruation, in the cure of contractions, local congestions, and\r\nincontinency of urine. I may mention finally the use of hypnotism for\r\nhelping in a safe and quick confinement.\r\n\r\nBut in addition to all this, we have the great help which psychotherapy\r\nmay bring indirectly in the treatment of physical diseases. I said, for\r\ninstance, that I do not believe in a real help by mere suggestion in\r\ncases of diabetes. But no one ought to underestimate the value which may\r\nresult for the treatment from a suggestion of a well-adapted diet. The\r\npatient who feels a craving for bread and potatoes and perhaps sweets,\r\nand is too weak to resist it, is indeed brought into safety if\r\nsuggestion liberates him from such desires. The same holds true for\r\nevery other diet and for any medical régime of life which does not\r\nharmonize with the natural instincts of the patient. For not a few\r\nsufferers, reënforcement of the interdict against coffee and tea or\r\nalcohol and tobacco is more important than any medicine. Hypnotic\r\nsuggestion can easily create dislike of the prohibited material and can\r\nbuild up new desires and inclinations. In the same way it is indirectly\r\nmost important to stir up, for instance, the sensations and feelings of\r\nappetite and thus to make normal nutrition possible. Also in cases of\r\nanæmia or tuberculosis, such indirect assistance can produce some\r\nbeneficial consequences.\r\n\r\nThe same holds true of the power of the psychotherapist to secure sleep.\r\nThe fight against insomnia which we discussed referred only to that\r\nsleeplessness which is itself an expression of the disease. But as a\r\nmatter of course, the loss of sleep can accompany most different\r\ndiseases, as an almost accidental result. To secure sleep means then not\r\nto treat the symptoms of the disease but a by-product; and yet every\r\nphysician knows how much is gained if the lost energies are restituted\r\nby a sound sleep. And finally we have the indirect help towards the cure\r\nby the suggestive removal of pain. We have no right to say that it is a\r\npure advantage for the treatment of the disease if the pain is centrally\r\ninhibited. Pain surely has its great biological significance and is in\r\nitself to a certain degree helpful towards the cure, inasmuch as it\r\nindicates clearly the seat and character of the trouble and warns\r\nagainst the misuse of the damaged organ which needs rest and protection.\r\nTo annihilate pain may mean to remove the warning signal and thus to\r\nincrease the chance for an injury. If we had no pain, our body would be\r\nmuch more rapidly destroyed in the struggle for existence. But that does\r\nnot contradict the other fact that pain is exhausting and that the fight\r\nagainst the pain decreases the resistance of the organism. As soon as\r\nthe disease is well recognized through the medium of pain and the\r\ncorrect treatment is inaugurated, not only the subjective comfort of the\r\npatient but the objective interest of his cure makes a removal of pain\r\nmost desirable. While it would be absurd to say that hypnotism can cure\r\ntuberculosis or cancer, it is fully justifiable to say that hypnotic\r\ntreatment in tuberculosis or cancer is to a high degree beneficial,\r\ninasmuch as it can secure sleep, appetite, and freedom from pain, three\r\nfactors which indirectly help to fight the disease. The elimination of\r\npain may sometimes also play its rôle in slight operations where other\r\nmethods of narcosis seem for any reason undesirable, and very frequently\r\nhypnotic suggestion has been used for this purpose at childbirth.\r\n\r\nThe same importance which belongs to the removal of bodily pain in the\r\ntreatment of a peripheral disease may be given to its mental\r\ncounterpart, to the worry, excitement, and emotional shock. They all\r\nstand in the way of a real success in any cure. Even the chances of a\r\ndangerous operation are entirely different for the patient who goes to\r\nit with free mind and a happy mood, with full confidence in its success,\r\nfrom those of a patient who has worked himself into a state of fear and\r\nanxiety. Here again the depression and the excitement are not in\r\nquestion as symptoms of a disease, as they were when we discussed the\r\nphobias and despondencies of the neurasthenic and of the hysteric. They\r\nare merely normal side-effects of the bodily disease, accentuated\r\nperhaps by a suggestible temperament. To eliminate all these emotions\r\nmeans to change most helpfully the whole atmosphere of the sick-room and\r\nto deprive invalidism of its saddest feature. This negative factor\r\ncorresponds of course most directly to the positive feature of building\r\nup new hope and joyful expectation. He who creates confidence makes\r\nconvalescence rapid and strengthens the power to overcome disease.\r\n\r\nIt would be medical narrowness if the physician were strictly to deny\r\nthat the effect of such emotional change may sometimes lead far beyond\r\nthe ordinary suggestive influences and that in this sense the miraculous\r\nreally happens. When out of a despondent mood in a suggestible brain an\r\nabsorbing emotion of confidence breaks through, a completely new\r\nequilibrium of the psychophysical system may indeed result. In such\r\ncases, improvements may set in which no sober physician can determine\r\nbeforehand. Central inhibitions which may have interfered a life long\r\nwith the normal functioning of the organism may suddenly be broken down\r\nand in an entirely unexpected way the mental influence gives to the\r\nforces of the body a new chance to help themselves. The reasoning of the\r\nscientific physician may easily stand in the way there. He may be afraid\r\nof such overstrong emotion because he knows too well that such\r\nunregulated powers may just as well destroy the good as in another case\r\nthe bad; in short, that ruin may result just as well as health. But that\r\ndoes not exclude the fact that indeed almost mysterious cures can be\r\nmade without really contradicting the scientific theories. Such are the\r\nmeans by which the mystical cults earn their laurels. A chance letter of\r\nthe type which often swells the mail of the psychologist may illustrate\r\nthis effect. I choose it because it is evidently written by a skeptic. A\r\nshort quotation from the lengthy epistle is sufficient.\r\n\r\n\"My condition was horrible in the extreme. I had consumption of the\r\nlungs and other supposedly fatal troubles, complicated by wrecked\r\nnerves. At the present writing, I am robust and splendidly healthy,\r\nlooking twenty years younger than I did at the period previously\r\ndescribed. The Christian Scientist saw my condition but appeared\r\nunconcerned and unafraid, I being absolutely hopeless, skeptical, and\r\ndeeply contemptuous meanwhile. On the third day of her treatment I was\r\ndesperate for sleep, she having forbidden drugs, and I deliberately took\r\nan overdose of chloral, thinking to die at once and end it. My\r\ncondition justified the act. She brought me out of the coma of the\r\nchloral after three hours of mental work, and the next day I felt\r\ndecidedly calmer and less afraid of the coming of night, should I live\r\nto meet it, which seemed doubtful. At noon she left me to go to her home\r\nto lunch. I was pondering seriously on her reiterated 'God is love and\r\nfills the universe and there is nothing beside Him,' when I suddenly had\r\na sensation of being lifted up or rising slowly and becoming lighter in\r\nbody. A rush of power that I have no way of describing to you filled me.\r\nI seemed to be a tremendous dynamo in the air several inches above the\r\nground and still ascending. When I noticed everything around me becoming\r\nprismatic and more or less translucent, I could have walked on water\r\nwithout sinking, and I had distinct understanding that matters seemed to\r\nbe disintegrating and dissolving around me. I was frightened but\r\nself-conscious and quiet. I remained in this state for about three\r\nhours, my consciousness seeming to have reached almost cosmic greatness.\r\nI could have cured, I felt, any human ill, was filled with an absorbing\r\naltruistic desire to help suffering. It was tremendous and totally\r\nforeign to my everyday attitude. At the end of the day, towards\r\ntwilight, I became wearied of the tremendous throbbing and exalted state\r\nin which I still remained and gave utterance to the thought aloud.\r\nAlmost before I had formulated it the condition left me, and like the\r\nsudden dropping of a weight, I struck the ground, the same dull,\r\nordinary person of everyday experience, but with the vast difference of\r\nperfect health, radiant and lasting to the present writing. My father\r\nlike myself is baffled and wondering. We are both pretty hard skeptics.\r\nI want the truth, whether it be terrible or otherwise. I am profoundly\r\ngrateful to the Christian Scientist, if I regained my health through her\r\nministrations, but I have not so far been able to label myself and rise\r\nin their church services to tell what has been done on me. The\r\nperformance repels me as crude and rather bad taste. I swear to you on\r\nmy honor as an American woman and a mother that what I have written you\r\nis true, absolutely. If you can give me any light or if my experience\r\nmay perchance give you a helping ray, my renewed lease on life may have\r\nhad some purpose after all, which I have often questioned in my cynical\r\nmoods.\"\r\n\r\nThe unprejudiced psychotherapist will be perfectly able to find room for\r\nsuch cures and, if it is the duty of the scientific physician to make\r\nuse of every natural energy in the interest of the patient's health, he\r\nhas no right to neglect the overwhelming powers of the apparently\r\nmysterious states. Some of this power ought to irradiate from his eye\r\nand his voice whenever he crosses the threshold of a sick-room. Some of\r\nthat power ought to emanate from him with every pill and drug which he\r\nprescribes. The psychotherapeutic energies which work for real health\r\noutside of the medical profession form a stream of vast power, but\r\nwithout solid bed and without dam. That stream when it overfloods will\r\ndevastate its borders and destroy its bridges. The physicians are the\r\nengineers whose duty it is to direct that stream into safe channels, to\r\ndistribute it so that it may work under control wherever it is needed,\r\nand to take care that its powerful energy is not lost for suffering\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nTHE PLACE OF PSYCHOTHERAPY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nPSYCHOTHERAPY AND THE CHURCH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe belief in supernatural energies has cured diseases at all times and\r\namong all peoples. Everywhere the patient sought help through the agents\r\nof higher forces and everywhere these agents themselves utilized their\r\ntherapeutic success for strengthening the belief in their over-natural\r\npower. The psychologist would say that it was always the same story, the\r\ninfluence of suggestion on the imagination of those who suffer. Yet the\r\nvariety of forms is abundant. Not only the special symbols but the whole\r\nattitude may take most varied character, and every special appearance is\r\nintimately related to the whole mystical background and to the\r\nreligious, scientific, and social ideas of the time. If nevertheless,\r\neven at the same time in the same country, very different forms of\r\nreligious suggestion are at work, it must not be forgotten that those\r\nwho live together in any nation and are united in many common purposes\r\nrepresent, after all, different stages in the development of\r\ncivilization. It has always been true that those whose minds are\r\nsaturated with the real culture of their time are working together with\r\nthose whose culture belongs to earlier centuries and with others whose\r\nminds are essentially of the type of the primitive peoples.\r\n\r\nLet us glance at the life of the savages. In darkest Africa, we find a\r\nspecial caste with its professional secrets which accepts new members\r\nonly after long tests. They are evidently persons with over-sensitive\r\nnervous systems and liable to hallucinations. As soon as they have their\r\nattacks of abnormal excitement, they are conceived to be agents of\r\nsuperhuman powers, and on account of this they are able to prescribe the\r\ncure of any diseases. In Australia, therapeutic power belongs to the\r\nkoonkie, a man who as a child had a vision of a demonic god. From him he\r\nreceived the power to heal the sick. He goes to the patient, touches the\r\npainful parts and rubs them and after a few minutes, he shows a little\r\npiece of wood which he had hidden in his hand and which he claims to\r\nhave extracted from the body of the sufferer. The native feels actually\r\ncured after such manipulation of the koonkie, who evidently believes\r\nhimself in his power. In Siberia, we find shamanism. The shaman stands\r\nbetween man and the gods. These shamans are excitable persons with\r\nepileptic tendencies, or at least over-suggestible men or women who by\r\nautosuggestion and imitation can bring themselves into ecstatic\r\nconvulsions. They alone know from the gods the means to treat diseases\r\nand their personal influence overcomes the ailment. In early America,\r\nbefore the European discovery, the cure of disease belonged in the same\r\nway to the middleman between the gods and human beings. In the Antilles,\r\nfor instance, the bohuti heals the diseases which are regarded as\r\npunishments of the gods for human neglect. The priest by inhaling a\r\ncertain powder brings himself into an ecstatic condition, then presses\r\nthe painful organs of the patient, sucks at various parts of his body\r\nuntil he finally produces some little bone or piece of meat which until\r\nthen he kept hidden in his mouth. The disease disappears, and the\r\nextracted bone is used as an amulet which secures good harvests. Other\r\nIndians had their piachas. They were selected from among the boys of\r\nabout ten years old and were then sent to lonely forests where they had\r\nto live for years upon plants and water without any friends, seeing only\r\nat night the older priests from whom they learned the ceremonies for\r\ncuring the sick. Here too their art consisted mostly in touching the\r\npainful parts of the body with the lips and sucking them to bring the\r\nevil saps out of the body by their supernatural power. In short, at the\r\nmost primitive stages in Africa and Asia, in America and Australia,\r\ntherapy was acknowledged to be a special power of men who had superhuman\r\nforces derived from good or evil gods.\r\n\r\nAll this repeats itself in the so-called half-civilizations. Among the\r\nmasses of China, mental and bodily diseases were ascribed to the fox,\r\nwhich plays such a large part in the superstitions of eastern Asia. The\r\npriest has the power to banish the fox by mystical writings which he\r\npastes on the wall of the sick-room, and the patient recovers, as the\r\nfox has to leave his body. In old Japan the mountain monks, who\r\ninherited their superhuman powers from a martyr of the fifth century,\r\ncan remove the diseases which have magical origin or which are induced\r\nby the devil. They also supply the magical papers covered with writings\r\nand pictures of birds, to prevent the appearance of smallpox and\r\npestilence and to cure a number of diseases. India, the classical land\r\nof suggestion and hypnosis, shows the most extensive connection between\r\nreligious and magical powers among which the cure of diseases is only\r\none feature. Such cure may be with medicaments or without, but the\r\nessential part always belongs to the prayers which make the good and\r\nevil spirits obedient to the healer. These prayers were often spoken in\r\nSanscrit, which the people did not understand and which thus added to\r\nthe mystic solemnity of the procedure. This suggestive influence of the\r\nuse of older languages for religious solemnities, known only to the\r\npriests, repeats itself also at all times and among all nations. In\r\nAssyria and Babylonia, too, medicine was exclusively a branch of\r\nmysticism and essentially in the hands of the priests, who by words and\r\nmagical beverages annihilated the influence of the malevolent demons. It\r\nis well known how the Old Testament reports the same traits of belief\r\namong the Jewish nation. We hear there that Miriam became leprous,\r\nwhite as snow, and Moses cried unto the Lord, saying: \"Heal her now, oh\r\nGod, I beseech thee.\" And after seven days Miriam was cured in\r\nconsequence of Moses' prayer. And again, \"The Lord sent fiery serpents\r\namong the people and they bit the people and much people of Israel\r\ndied.--And Moses prayed for the people.--And Moses made a serpent of\r\nbrass and put it upon a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had\r\nbitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the old Egyptians, it was especially Isis who discovered many\r\nremedies and had been much experienced in medicine, and after having\r\nbecome immortal, it was her greatest pleasure to cure the sick and to\r\nannounce the right remedies in dreams to those who came to sleep in her\r\ntemples. Many who could not be cured by any physician, and who had lost\r\ntheir sight and hearing or could not move their limbs, became well again\r\nwhen they took refuge in her temples. The same holds true for the\r\nSerapis temple; even the best known men go there to sleep to get from\r\nthe goddess cures for themselves or for their friends. It is well known\r\nagain that in other ways the old Greeks attached medical influence to\r\ntemples and sacred springs and rivers and tombs. There were sacred\r\nsprings which cured everybody who drank from them, there were statues\r\nwhich removed every disease when offerings were brought to them. Here\r\nagain the most frequent is the cure of paralytic symptoms and of\r\nobsessions. The Orphic priests of old Greece most nearly resembled the\r\nshamans of the savages.\r\n\r\nThose who are inclined to give to the life of Christ a rationalistic\r\ninterpretation have often pointed out that the therapeutic effects\r\ndescribed in the Gospels might also be understood as effects of\r\nsuggestion by word and tactual impressions, produced especially on\r\nhysterics, epileptics, paralytics, and psychasthenics. Such\r\nrationalistic interpretations could also explain in the same way through\r\nthe suggestive influence in the minds of the sick, those cures which\r\nChrist effected through others without being present himself. Here\r\nbelongs perhaps the cure of the servant of the centurion in Capernaum or\r\nthe cure of the daughter of the woman of Canaan. \"And when he had called\r\nunto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean\r\nspirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all\r\nmanner of disease.\" The Acts give us the full details of how Peter and\r\nPaul cured the lame and how special miracles were performed by their\r\nhands. No doubt this belief in the curative effect of the disciples and\r\ntheir successors fills the first centuries after Christ. Eusebius tells\r\nus how they healed the sick by laying on of hands. The forms were\r\nfrequently changing through the history of Christianity but the essence\r\nremains the same. Sometimes more emphasis is laid on the personal factor\r\nof the priest, sometimes more on the sacred origin of the symbol as in\r\nthe case of the relics, sometimes more on prayer and godly works, but it\r\nis always the religious belief which cures. Typical are the therapeutic\r\nwonders of Francis de Assisi. He banishes devils, cures gout, lameness,\r\nand blindness. The traditional means of suggestion, prayer and the\r\nlaying on of hands, had in the meantime been supplemented by the sign of\r\nthe cross which the church had added. Moreover whatever he had only\r\ntouched became a remedy for the sick. Protestantism brought no change in\r\nthis respect. Martin Luther writes: \"The physicians consider in the\r\ndiseases only the natural causes from which a disease results and want\r\nto remove them by their medicines, and they are quite right in it. But\r\nthey do not see that the devil often sends to one a disease which has no\r\nnatural causes. Therefore there must exist a higher medicine, namely,\r\nthe religious belief and the prayer through which the spiritual medicine\r\ncan be found in the word of God.\"\r\n\r\nThe broad undercurrent of religious cures, especially in the Catholic\r\nChurch and in the Greek Church, but with fewer symbols also outside of\r\nthem, has up to the present time never ceased to flow. But independent\r\nof it the therapeutic belief has again and again been focused on certain\r\nindividuals or certain sects or certain schools, in the midst of the\r\nsteady progress of scientific medicine and sometimes synthesizing the\r\nreligious claims with new-fashioned scholarly ideas. In the seventeenth\r\ncentury, for instance, the Irish nobleman Greatrakes became a famous\r\ncenter of attraction. He felt himself to be the bearer of a divine\r\nmission and healed the sick, appealing to their belief by laying on of\r\nhands and by movements which we nowadays call passes. Much more\r\ninfluential in the eighteenth century was Pastor Gassner in Germany.\r\nGassner succeeded in producing with his religious psychotherapy such a\r\ntremendous stir that many thousands who needed cure from functional\r\ndiseases, and thousands of curious people, too, streamed to his church\r\nin Ellwangen, and his methods of cure spread almost contagiously among\r\nthe ministers of the country: an Emmanuel Church Movement of the\r\neighteenth century. Gassner, too, discriminated between the diseases\r\nwhich have natural causes, that is the organic diseases, which he did\r\nnot treat, and the functional ones, which were obsessions of the devil.\r\nTo determine to which group the disease belonged, he ordered the devil\r\nto produce the symptoms of the sickness. When in this way the\r\nobsessional character of the disease was recognized, the minister began\r\nwith his suggestive influences to banish the devil. He demanded firm\r\nconfidence in the name of Christ, reënforced his effectiveness by\r\nnarration of the cures he had perfected, used further certain\r\nmanipulations such as the rubbing of the skin and passes on the head,\r\nand finally gave his suggestions with authoritative firmness. Many\r\nministers who became his pupils treated like him with skillful\r\ncombination of religion and hypnoid influences the spasms, catalepsies,\r\nneurasthenias, paralysis, and deafness, of neurotic patients.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to follow in detail the frequent similar occurrences\r\nbetween Gassner's time and our own. We all know where we are to-day.\r\nThe medical profession and the medical science with its bacteriology\r\nand serum therapy, its Roentgen rays and its organic chemistry is far\r\naway from the church and without concession to religious aspects. On the\r\nother hand there are the yearly processions of thousands and thousands\r\nwho make their pilgrimage to the sacred waters of Lourdes, guided by the\r\nCatholic priests, half-hypnotized by the hope that the Virgin will cure\r\nthem. In every niche of the Catholic churches in all Europe, there are\r\nkneeling before the burning candles those who pray for nothing but their\r\nhealth; and their belief will sometimes yield almost miraculous cures.\r\nIn England the Society of Emmanuel was founded by men and women to whom\r\nit seemed necessary to bring back to the minds of Christians the\r\nundoubted fact that Christ taught and worked for physical heath and to\r\nrevive this sense of power over disease. Thousands were treated and the\r\nresults have been \"most encouraging.\" Among the cases successfully\r\ntreated may be mentioned \"one of cancer in which case the specialist\r\ncalled in had given the sufferer only three months to live while by\r\nmeans of the laying on of hands in prayer, a complete cure was\r\neffected.\"\r\n\r\nNot dissimilar in its proceedings, though much more elaborate in its\r\nmetaphysics than this movement in the midst of the Church of England, we\r\nfind in America the Christian Science movement started by Mrs. Eddy. It\r\nwas new as a therapeutic system, however old its philosophic elements.\r\nMrs. Mary Baker Eddy writes: \"In the year 1866 I discovered the Christ\r\nscience or divine laws of life and named them Christian Science. God had\r\nbeen graciously fitting me during many years for the reception of a\r\nfinal revelation of the absolute divine principle of scientific being\r\nand healing.\" The disease is cured for the Christian Scientist by the\r\nbelief in God because a true belief in God includes the insight that God\r\nis all reality and that reality therefore cannot include the ungodlike,\r\nthat is, error and sin and disease. Disease is thus recognized as unreal\r\nand if it has become unreal, of course it has disappeared as part of our\r\nreal life. Thousands and thousands have been cured under this symbol.\r\nAnd as the latest chapter of this history of five thousand years, we\r\nfind the movement which Dr. Worcester has started in Boston and which,\r\ntoo, spreads rapidly over the continent and awakens the ambition of many\r\na minister in every denomination in the land. The aim is to cure the\r\npatient by reënforcing in him through religious persuasion, through the\r\ncontact with the symbols of the church and with godly men and through\r\nreligious suggestion, a confident belief which gives new unity and\r\nthrough it new strength to the mind of the sufferer until it overcomes\r\nthe functional disease of the body. The physician at first examines\r\nwhether or not an irreparable organic disease has attacked the body, but\r\nif he does not find such organic destruction, then the patient is to be\r\nhanded over to the minister, who will take care that through his\r\nreligious belief and inspiration the mind will triumph over the weakness\r\nof the body.\r\n\r\nWhoever looks in this way over the history of mankind can no longer\r\ndoubt that belief in supernatural powers is really an agency for the\r\novercoming of disease. We may be interested in it from the standpoint of\r\nreligion or from the standpoint of psychology or from the standpoint of\r\nethnology. In every case we have to acknowledge that he who believes may\r\nbe cured. If we abstract first from the religious point of view and\r\nconsider the problem as a scientific one, we have to interpret all those\r\ncurative effects of belief as results of suggestion. The attitude of the\r\none who gives the suggestion has gone in the history of mankind through\r\nall possible variations. He may have been filled with fervent belief,\r\nrejecting any interpretation except the religious one, or he may have\r\nproduced the suggestion of belief almost with the intentions of a\r\nphysician who simply relies on the physiological effects of any\r\nsuggestion; and between these two extremes any number of steps is\r\npossible. Moreover the suggestion may have been detached from any\r\npersonality and may have belonged to any symbol of religious energies,\r\nlike the relics of the Catholic Church. Even the most skeptical of\r\nethnologists ought to acknowledge that very little in this history of\r\nreligious psychotherapy points to a conscious fraud. Those shamans of\r\nthe savages from Siberia to South Africa, from Australia to Mexico, are\r\nin ecstasies which make them really believe in the mysterious power of\r\ntheir manipulations. The ethnologist finds indeed as most common\r\ncharacteristics of all those primitive movements that those who cure\r\nare chosen from among neurotics who by epileptic attacks or\r\nhallucinations and obsessions are predisposed to feel themselves as\r\nbearers of a higher mission.\r\n\r\nYet whether the attitude of the transmitter is religious or\r\nhalf-scientific, is inspired or insincere, the receiver of the\r\nsuggestion is always in the same condition: he is believing in his cure\r\nthrough religious influence and through his belief he is helped, if he\r\nis helped at all. This uniformity does not exclude the fact that the\r\npatients too may show a manifoldness of mental states. They may remain\r\nin a completely waking state with reënforced suggestibility, or they may\r\ngo over into a drowsy or hypnoid state or deeply into a hypnotic state,\r\nor may receive the suggestions as we saw even in sleep. Further their\r\nminds may be entirely filled with fine religious emotions and the\r\ntherapeutic effect be only an appendix or, on the other hand, this\r\nconfident expectation of the relief from pain may be their central\r\ncontent of consciousness and may control the whole mental interplay. The\r\npractical problem of the scientist is to consider how far these\r\nreligious energies ought to be used today in the interests of the cure\r\nof diseases.\r\n\r\nFrom a scientific standpoint such a discussion can hardly be fruitful\r\nwith those who consistently take the religious point of view only. A\r\nview of the world which demands the faith that religious belief moves an\r\nalmighty power to cure a diseased organ, or that the disease has no\r\nreality for one who lives in God, is invulnerable to merely scientific\r\narguments. The sick woman who kneels between the candles before the\r\npicture of the Virgin, praying that her heart, which the physicians\r\ndeclare incurable on account of a valvular disease, be cured, moves in a\r\nsphere of thought which lies entirely outside of the medical study of\r\ncauses and effects. The same holds true, for instance, of Christian\r\nScience. This statement is in itself no criticism and no argument; it\r\nonly acknowledges that any possible exchange of opinions has to be\r\ncarried over from the scientific psychological ground to that of\r\nmetaphysics and philosophy. It is quite different with modern movements\r\nof the type of the Emmanuel Church Movement, where the religious thought\r\nis intertwined with the psychological theory and where an actual\r\ncoöperation of physician and minister is sought. Here church and science\r\nreally meet on common ground, and it is important to examine objectively\r\nwhether it is wise and beneficial to encourage the spreading of this\r\ntempting enterprise. The movement has reached the large cities between\r\nthe Atlantic and the Pacific and is beginning to captivate the ministers\r\nof the small towns and villages. It seems as if an epoch has come for\r\nthe church--the church which too long has ministered only to the\r\nspiritual needs of the community will at last remember again that Christ\r\nhealed the sick, that mind and body are one, that the personality must\r\nbe understood in its unity, and that endless fields of blessed influence\r\nmay again be opened to the church when the minister becomes the\r\nphysician of his congregation. Whoever knows the suggestive power of\r\nsuch a social movement, and considers the ease with which triumphant\r\nsuccesses may be reached in this field and the disappointing and\r\ndiscouraging reduction of power which the church shows everywhere in its\r\npurely spiritual hold on the community, can foresee that all the\r\nconditions are favorable for a rapid spread and that the church clinics\r\nwill become the American fashion of the near future.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that the Christian church takes in hand there once\r\nmore a work which belonged to it through centuries. But they were\r\ncenturies in which the priest was in a certain degree the physician,\r\njust as he was the educator and teacher, simply because in the church\r\nthere was centered all cultural influences which the community knew. The\r\ncomplexity of modern times has for centuries demanded the opposite\r\nsystem. Centralization is allowed only to the purely administrative\r\ninfluence of the state, while all the active functions are divided among\r\nspecialists. We rely on the expert in education, we demand the expert in\r\nmedicine: is more gained or lost if the religious leader now again\r\nsuddenly undertakes a part of the functions which belong to the\r\nphysician? It is true that the ministers of this school do not propose\r\nto undertake the physician's work to its full extent. They leave to him\r\nthe first and in some respects most important step, the diagnosis, and\r\nabstain from the treatment of such cases as the physician declares\r\ninaccessible to psychical influences. They do not heal cancer and\r\nphthisis like the Emmanuel Movement in England or like the mental\r\nhealers in America.\r\n\r\nBut is not perhaps just this compromise dangerous in another direction,\r\ninasmuch as it awakens a feeling of safety in those who feel in sympathy\r\nwith scientific medicine? They have passed the hand of the physician and\r\nbelieve accordingly that because their illness is recognized as\r\nfunctional, the minister can really perform all that ought to be done.\r\nIs this belief justified? At the threshold, it occurs to every one that\r\nsuch a diagnosis by physicians may be erroneous and that the chances for\r\nsuch error are under the conditions of the church clinic much greater\r\nthan under the conditions of a regular medical treatment. The\r\ndiagnostician who treats the patient himself has ever new chances to\r\nremodel his diagnosis and to correct it under the influence of\r\ntherapeutic effects. The danger is great that under the proposed\r\nconditions, the activity of the physician will be superficial, because\r\nhe is deprived of his chief means, the constant observation. But we may\r\nabstract from this possibility of error. Does the fact that the disease\r\nis one the symptoms of which may yield to psychical treatment really\r\nmake it advisable that the further treatment be handed over to the\r\nclergyman? To begin at the beginning, the usefulness of psychical\r\ntreatment does not at all exclude the strong desirability of physical\r\ntreatment at the same time. The emphasis which is laid on religious\r\npersuasion and inspiration, on prayer and spiritual uplift practically\r\nexcludes the use of baths and douches, of massage and electricity, of\r\ntonics and sedatives. And yet it is not caprice or sham when every\r\nwell-schooled medical specialist applies such means in the treatment of\r\nthese so-called functional diseases of the nervous system. The minister\r\napplies and can apply only one of many possible methods for cure and\r\nyet, if we really want to make use of the resources of modern knowledge,\r\nwe have to adapt most carefully all possible means to the individual\r\ncase. If we take the strictly religious standpoint the situation is of\r\ncourse different, but if we speak of psychophysiological effects, we may\r\nacknowledge the healing influence of prayer and yet rely in the special\r\ncase still more on bromide or strychnine. Yet the religious\r\npsychotherapists not only neglect the physical help but usually\r\nemphasize the antagonism. Some of the strongest supporters proclaim it\r\nas a non-drug healing, thus deciding adversely about a medical method\r\nregarding which they have no means at all to judge.\r\n\r\nParallel to this neglect of physical theory goes, of course, the neglect\r\nof the physical factors in the disease. The physician may have justly\r\ndiagnosed that the case is \"merely\" neurasthenia or hysteria and not a\r\nbrain tumor or paralysis of the brain. Yet that does not mean in the\r\nleast that a real treatment which remains in harmony with the progress\r\nof modern medicine ought to ignore the hundred physical elements which\r\nenter daily into the disease. There are the most complex digestive\r\nproblems involved which demand a thorough understanding of chemical\r\nmetabolism, there are still more complex problems of the sexual organs\r\nwhich the minister certainly ought not to discuss with his female\r\nparishioners, there are bacteriological questions, there are questions\r\nof the peripheral nervous system and sense organs; in short, questions\r\nwhich belong to a world into which the minister as minister has never\r\nlooked. Even if he believes he might gather in an amateurish way some\r\ninformation as to those questions which lie so far from his experience\r\nas student of divinity, how can his half-baked knowledge compare with\r\nthe experienced study of the regular physician? Such physical questions\r\ncannot be settled by the preparatory examination of the physician; they\r\ncome up every day during the treatment and what the spiritual diet which\r\nthe minister offers may help, may at the same time be ruined by the\r\nphysical diet about which the minister without chemistry cannot judge.\r\n\r\nBut let us abstract from the bodily aspect. Is the situation really very\r\ndifferent for the mental one? The appeal to the religious emotion, the\r\nreënforcement of religious faith is from the religious point of view\r\ncertainly the one central effort from which everything has to irradiate.\r\nThe unity of this controlling thought is the glory of such inspiration.\r\nBut as soon as we handle this thought as a psychotherapeutic remedy,\r\ndestined to restitute the disturbed psychological equilibrium, it\r\nbecomes evident that the very uniformity of it makes it a clumsy,\r\ninadjustable pattern. If there is anything which impresses the careful\r\nstudent of psychology, it is the over-rich manifoldness, the complexity\r\nof mental life. Even the simplest content of consciousness is a tissue\r\nwoven from millions of threads and any stereotyped influence means\r\ncrudeness and destruction. The minister's attitude towards inner life is\r\nthere directly opposite to that of the psychologist. He cannot enter\r\ninto those endless interplays of associations and memories, or\r\ninhibitions and sensations and impulses, he cannot examine from which\r\nremote psychological sources those ideas have arisen, how the feelings\r\nbecome disturbed and the judgments sidetracked. He should not analyze\r\neven if he could, because his whole aim is to synthesize. He asks for\r\nthe meaning and not for the structure, for the aims and not for the\r\nelements. His therapeutic effort is therefore not even directed towards\r\na careful rebuilding of the injured parts of the mind, but it is nothing\r\nmore than a general stimulation to the mind to help itself. By touching\r\non one of the deepest emotional layers of the mind, the layer of\r\nreligious ideas, the minister gives to the soul an intense shock and\r\nexpects that in the resulting perturbation, everything will be shaken\r\nand may then settle itself by its own energies in a healthful way. It is\r\na fact that that can sometimes happen and under certain conditions the\r\nchances for it are even favorable. Under many other conditions the\r\nchances are unfavorable and the result does not happen at all.\r\n\r\nBut whether or not a cure results, in any case it is certainly not an\r\neffort which can be said to be in harmony with modern science. The idea\r\nof science is always to understand the complex from its elements and to\r\nrestore the disturbed complex object by recognizing the disturbances in\r\nthe elements and by bringing those disturbed elements into right shape\r\nagain. Certainly the psychologist, too, in examining carefully the\r\ninjured mental mechanism may discover emotional injuries which might be\r\ncured by the introduction of religious ideas, but he will not give to\r\nthem a value different from the introduction of any other ideas and\r\nemotions, for instance, those of art and music and poetry, those of\r\nsocial company or civic interest, of travel or sport or politics. Each\r\nmay have its particular value and to cure every mind with religious\r\nemotion would be from a psychological point of view as one-sided as it\r\nwould be to cure every disturbed stomach by milk alone. Moreover in very\r\nfrequent cases, for instance, of neurasthenia or hysteria or\r\npsychasthenia, such wholesale remedies can form only the background of\r\nthe treatment, but all the details have to be furnished with reference\r\nto a most subtle analysis of the special symptoms, and a particular\r\norganic symptom or a particular memory idea or a special inhibition by a\r\nwell-selected counter-idea will do much more than any great emotional\r\nrevival.\r\n\r\nStereotyped religious appeal is not only insufficient in an abundance of\r\ncases--it must never be forgotten that those who nowadays go to the\r\nminister for their health are already selected cases more open to\r\nreligious suggestion than the average--but can easily be decidedly\r\nharmful. Of course that holds true for every physical remedy too, and\r\nthe judgment of the exact limit is one of the chief duties of the\r\nphysician. It holds also for the other mental factors like sympathy. A\r\ncertain amount of sympathy may save a neurasthenic from despair, and\r\nonly a little more may make his disease much worse and may develop in\r\nhim a consciousness of misery which makes him a complete invalid. Still\r\nmore is it true for the religious emotion, from the standpoint of\r\nnervous physiology the strongest next to the sexual emotion, that it can\r\nbe the healing drug or the destructive poison. Everything depends upon\r\nthe degree of the intrusion and upon the resistance of the\r\npsychophysical system. From a purposive point of view there cannot be\r\nfaith enough, from a causal point of view there can easily be too much\r\nof the faith emotion. Religious fervor has at all times helped to create\r\nhysteria and to develop psychasthenias. It cannot be otherwise. A group\r\nof ideas which has such tremendous power over man must easily be able to\r\nproduce inhibitions and exertions which become dangerous to a nervous\r\nsystem the constitution of which is pathological. To leave such a\r\ndangerous and powerful remedy entirely in the hands of men who by their\r\nprofession must aim towards a maximum dose of religious influence can\r\ncertainly not be in the interests of the patients or of the community.\r\n\r\nEven the whole technique of this movement awakens the fear of possible\r\nharmful consequences. On the one hand we have the movement itself as a\r\npopular suggestion for the suggestible masses. The patient who seeks the\r\nhelp of a scientific neurologist hardly becomes a center of psychical\r\ncontagion, but the church services for the sick offer favorable\r\nconditions for an epidemic development of hysterical symptoms. But more\r\nimportant are the influences on the individual patient. The whole\r\npurpose of the treatment demands the highest possible degree of\r\nsuggestibility brought about by the ministerial persuasion. But it is\r\nevident that this degree of suggestibility means at the same time the\r\nmost fertile soil for every chance suggestion and for influences which\r\nare perhaps entirely unintended. The physician and the psychologist,\r\nconsidering the mental state with reference to its elements, will make\r\nmost careful use of those accessory influences. The minister, who\r\nnecessarily has his spiritual aim in mind, cannot even become aware of\r\nall the involuntary influences which reach the mind in its most\r\nsuggestible state. There can be no doubt that it would often need\r\npsychological art to avoid the creation of new pathological symptoms in\r\nsuch half-hypnotized patients. Yet the minister even goes so far as to\r\nmake use of the sleeping mind without any consideration of the possible\r\ndamage which may be done to his subject. He goes to the bedside of a\r\nsleeping girl and whispers his suggestions and is satisfied when they\r\nshow their effects the next day. It does not lie in his horizon to\r\nconsider the grave consequences which such suggestions during sleep may\r\nproduce during future years in the brain the sleep of which has been\r\ntransformed into such half-somnambulic relations. Hysterias may be\r\ncreated by such methods. No one can blame the minister for his\r\nremoteness from such doubts and problems, but the physician is to be\r\nblamed if he encourages the belief that all this still belongs to the\r\nproper sphere of the ministerial worker in abnormal psychology.\r\n\r\nThose engaged in such work were not long in finding out that the mere\r\nemotional inspiration is often no sufficient remedy, and the development\r\nwent along the same lines in which it has gone everywhere for some\r\nthousands of years. Not to disappoint the sufferers, the religion had to\r\nbecome in very many cases simply an inactive side issue and the real\r\ncure was performed by the same methods with which any worldly\r\nneuropathologist would go to work. If the woman who cannot sleep is\r\ncured from her insomnia by being made to listen to the beats of a\r\nmetronome, it may sometimes be effective, however crude, but it is\r\ncertainly no longer religion, even though the metronome stands in a\r\nminister's room. The more the movement spreads to those who have no\r\npsychological training and knowledge, the more it must be necessary for\r\nthem to import the whole claptrap of the quack hypnotist and soon the\r\nminister may discover that in certain cases physical means and drugs\r\nhelp still better. Thus he simply enters into competition with the\r\nregular physician, only with the difference that he has never studied\r\nmedicine. The chances are great that in his hands even such remedies and\r\ndrugs may do harm and finally, even if they were effective, is not the\r\nquestion justified: will not religion suffer?\r\n\r\nIndeed we have so far considered the question from one side only. We\r\nhave confined ourselves to the question of how far such a movement is\r\nsound for the interests of the patient; but can we be blind to the other\r\nside and overlook the not less important problem of whether it lies in\r\nthe interests of religion and of the church to amalgamate its spiritual\r\nwork with a medical one? We are not thinking of those widespread, unfair\r\narguments to the effect that this whole movement is undignified because\r\nit is instituted by the desire to fill the empty pews or to make\r\ncompetition with the success of Christian Science. That is utterly\r\nunjust. But there are intrinsic factors in the movement which interfere\r\nwith the true aims of religion. First of all it cheapens religion by\r\nputting the accent in the meaning of life on personal comfort and\r\nabsence of pain. The originators of the Emmanuel Movement stand well\r\nabove such error, but their national congregations do not. Certainly the\r\nlonging for pleasure and a well feeling and the abhorrence of pain and\r\nillness pervades our practical life and keeps in motion all our\r\nutilitarian efforts. But if there is one power in our life which ought\r\nto develop in us a conviction that pleasure is not the highest goal and\r\nthat pain is not the worst evil, then it ought to be philosophy and\r\nreligion. It is only the surface appearance if it seems as if the\r\nreligious therapeutics minimizes the importance of pain; in truth it\r\ndoes the opposite. It tries to abolish pain, but not because it thinks\r\nlittle of pain; on the contrary, because it thinks so much of pain that\r\nit is willing even to put the whole of religion into the service of\r\nthis strife for bodily comfort. The longing for freedom from pain\r\nbecomes the one aim for which we are to be religious. In a time which\r\ndenies all absolute ideals, which seeks the meaning of truth only in a\r\npragmatic usefulness, it may be quite consistent to seek the meaning of\r\nreligion in its service for removal of pain, and personal enjoyment. But\r\nin that case the ideal of both religion and truth is lost. It is finally\r\nnot less undignified for religion to seek support for the religious\r\nbelief in effects which it shares and knows that it shares with any\r\nsuperstitious belief on earth. Granted that the church can cure: the\r\nshaman of Siberia can cure too, and the amulets of Thibet not less. The\r\npsychologizing church knows, therefore, that it is not the value of the\r\nreligion which restores the unbalanced nervous system; and yet it wants\r\nto provide for the spreading of true belief by the miraculous cures\r\nwhich it exhibits.\r\n\r\nThis situation naturally produces the desire of the church to substitute\r\na religious explanation for a psychological one. It is claimed that\r\nafter all it is not the mental effect of the prayer, but the prayer\r\nitself, not the psychophysical emotion of religion, but the value of\r\nreligion which determines the cure. Yet in that moment the whole\r\nmovement in its modern shape comes into a still more precarious\r\nposition. If the cure results from the inner value of the religion how\r\ncan we confine it to the so-called functional diseases and abstain from\r\nany hope in organic diseases? Luther, from his religious point of view,\r\nstill had the right to separate the two groups because only those\r\nfunctional diseases were effects of the devil, obsessions which could be\r\nbanished by the minister and by prayer, while the other diseases did not\r\nresult from the devil, but merely from natural causes. Such a definition\r\ndoes not fit into the modern system. To-day from a really religious\r\npoint of view, both groups of diseases must be acknowledged to be\r\nnatural or with Mrs. Eddy, as the work of the unholy spirit. Christian\r\nScience is indeed by far more consistent. If the cure results through\r\nthe meaning and value of religion, there is no reason whatever why\r\ncancer and diphtheria and paralysis should not be cured as well as\r\npsychasthenia. And if, on the other hand, organic diseases cannot be\r\ncured because the psychophysical process of the religious emotion has no\r\ninfluence over diphtheria bacilli, then the whole process is removed to\r\nthe causal sphere and it is acknowledged that the purposive meaning of\r\nreligion is not in question at all. The whole system of such religious\r\npsychotherapeutics is therefore in its inner structure contradictory. It\r\ncontains causal and purposive elements without any possibility of\r\nunifying them. They are loosely mixed, and the power of prayer means on\r\none page something entirely different from what it means on another. In\r\nthese respects Christian Science is by far more unified and in harmony\r\nwith itself; its therapeutics is really anchored in a system.\r\n\r\nFrom a scientific point of view, its dangerousness is of course much\r\ngreater inasmuch as it extends its methods over every organic disease\r\nand thus applies merely psychical treatment where from a standpoint of\r\nscientific medicine, physical treatment would be absolutely necessary.\r\nMoreover its philosophy is after all only a pseudophilosophy; its\r\ntempting equations of disease and error and sin and unreality are\r\nultimately a mere playing with conceptions. If we were to point to the\r\nroot of the misunderstanding in Christian Science, we should say that\r\neverything depends on the philosophical commonplace that the objects\r\nwith which we deal in our life are ideas and that our whole experience\r\nis mind. \"Christian Science reveals incontrovertibly that Mind is\r\nAll-in-All, that the only realities are the divine mind and idea.\" But\r\nnow silently this mental character of the real world is identified with\r\nthe mental experience which stands in contrast to the physical\r\nexperience. There results the impression that physical experience\r\ntherefore, does not belong to the world of reality. It is evident,\r\nhowever, that mental in contrast to physical means something entirely\r\ndifferent from mental in the philosophical sense. In the latter meaning\r\nof the word, we all agree that the world is mental; the word mental\r\nindicates there that the world has reality not in itself but only as\r\nexperience of subjects. In the second sense, mental or psychical means\r\nthat it is experience for one particular subject only and not for every\r\npossible subject. The physical thing, for instance this table, is indeed\r\ndifferent from my mental memory idea of a table, inasmuch as every\r\npossible subject can experience this table while my mental memory image\r\nbelongs to me alone. The physical table and the mental memory image of\r\nit are both equally mental in the philosophical sense, inasmuch as the\r\nphysical which is object for every possible subject and in this sense\r\nnot mental is therefore not less given to subjects. Every physical body\r\nwith its disease is thus in one sense taken as something not mental\r\nwhile in another sense as mental; if we use the same word in two\r\nentirely different meanings, it indeed cannot be difficult to\r\ndemonstrate any metaphysical consequences.\r\n\r\nBut we do not have to deal here with the metaphysics of \"Science and\r\nHealth.\" If it is brought down to the concrete application, we stand\r\nbefore the same confusion which characterizes all compromises. Causal\r\neffects are sought in a sphere which belongs to purposive values. The\r\npsychological effects of the emotion of faith are sought and are\r\nmisinterpreted as the emanations of religious powers. Religious\r\npsychotherapeutics in all its forms seeks to demonstrate to us the\r\ntriumph of the soul over the body, while in reality it deals only with\r\nthe mental mechanism which as such belongs to the chain of causal events\r\nin the same natural way as the organism. The soul, as spiritual agency\r\nin its sphere of purposes and ideals, does not enter the machinery of\r\npsychotherapy, and the psychological material on which psychotherapy is\r\napplied is not freer and not better and does not stand higher than the\r\nmaterial of the bodily cells and tissues. The Emmanuel Movement\r\ndeserves the highest credit for bringing about a systematic contact\r\nbetween religious faith cure and scientific medicine, but the time in\r\nwhich the minister himself undertook the medical treatment had to be a\r\ntime of transition. It had to lead to a new relation in which the\r\nministerial function is confined to the spiritual task of upbuilding a\r\nmind while the therapeutic function remains entirely in the hands of the\r\nphysician. Where the physician believes that the psychomedical treatment\r\ndemands a new equilibrium of the patient to be secured by religion,\r\nthere the minister should be called for assistance. Psychotherapeutic\r\nhospitals would offer the most favorable conditions for such\r\ncoöperation. But the minister ought to enter even such a hospital with a\r\nstrictly spiritual aim, and he should never forget that the task of the\r\nchurch stands much higher than the utilitarian task of removing pain\r\nfrom the sick room. But if those psychotherapeutic hospitals will\r\nflourish and the physicians will at last make use of psychical factors\r\nin their regular practice, they ought not to forget on their part that\r\nthe important step forward was taken under the pressure of popular\r\nreligious movements. The ministers first saw what the physicians ought\r\nto have seen before, but the physicians will see it more fully and more\r\ncorrectly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nPSYCHOTHERAPY AND THE PHYSICIAN\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery thought of the physician moves in a world the structure of which\r\nis determined by the thought forms of cause and effect. He knows the\r\neffect which he wants to produce; it is the restitution of the organic\r\nequilibrium. He studies the causes which can secure that end. And again\r\nthe disturbance of the equilibrium itself, the disease, is for him an\r\neffect which he seeks to understand by an analysis of the preceding\r\ncauses. The means which he applies can therefore be valued only in\r\nreference to their efficiency; no other point of view belongs to his\r\nworld. The religiously valuable may be indifferent or even undesirable\r\nin the interplay of causes, and the morally indifferent may be most\r\nimportant for the physician's interests. The religious emotion\r\naccordingly has to stand in line with any other mental excitement or\r\nwith a hundred physical means which the laboratory and the drug store\r\nsupply. The physician will welcome the methods of treatment without\r\nreference to metaphysical systems or to religious beliefs. To him it is\r\nan empirical fact that many disturbances of mind and body which\r\ninterfere with the equilibrium of life can be repaired by influences on\r\ncertain psychophysical organs. A part of these repairing influences he\r\nfinds in the sense stimuli, for instance, of spoken or written words\r\nwhich reach the brain and awaken associative and reactive processes. He\r\nfinds further that these influences can be reënforced in their\r\neffectiveness by certain general conditions of the nervous system and\r\nagain finds that these can be secured partly by sense impressions, and\r\nonce more especially by words.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of course to the physician that application of any sense\r\ninfluence on the brain demands a most subtle analysis of the\r\npsychophysical situation. Therefore he gives no less attention to the\r\ndisentangling of the whole history of the individual brain, to its\r\nstored-up energies and to its mental possibilities. If he knows the\r\npsychophysical status, and finally if he knows the means of influencing\r\nthose psychophysical organs which stimulate or inhibit the disturbed\r\ncentral parts, he can foresee the psychophysical effects with a certain\r\ndefiniteness. Thus everything depends upon the sharpest possible, almost\r\nmicroscopic, mental analysis, together with a most thorough examination\r\nof the whole nervous system and the most careful calculation of the\r\nmental influences applied. The vagueness of the religious appeal\r\ntransforms itself into an exact calculation and the unity of the soul\r\nwhich seeks spiritual uplift transforms itself into a mental mechanism\r\nof bewildering complexity, and yet not more complex than the physical\r\norganism, to which for instance, the chemical means of the physician\r\nadminister. To-day medical science is certainly only in the beginning of\r\nthis great movement. Especially the analysis of the psychophysical\r\nconditions still lacks a sufficient refinement of method. But at least\r\nthe causal principle is now fully recognized and the scientific man of\r\ntoday no longer doubts that this whole play of psychotherapeutic\r\nprocesses goes on as a causal process in the psychophysical system of\r\nthe individual without any mysteriousness, without any magnetic\r\ninfluences, without any miraculous interference, without any agencies\r\nexcept those which are working in our ordinary mental life in attention\r\nand reaction, in memory and sleep.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising how late this recognition appeared in the history of\r\nhuman knowledge. It occurred here as in so many places in the history of\r\nhuman civilization that the simple is the late outcome of the complex.\r\nJust as in technique the apparatus often began in a complex, cumbersome\r\nway and then became steadily simplified, so it is with explanations. The\r\ncomplex machinery of cosmic influences and obsessions by demons and\r\nmagnetic mysteries was at first necessary until the simple explanation\r\nwas found that all the results depend upon the working of the mind\r\nitself. Yet in technique and explanation alike, such progress to the\r\nsimpler means always at the same time the making use of much richer\r\nknowledge. To explain an obsession or a sleep state by the agencies of\r\nevil spirits or magnetic fluids is certainly an unnecessary side\r\nconception. But to understand it from the working of the mind\r\npresupposes after all the whole modern physiological psychology, and\r\nthus had to be the latest step.\r\n\r\nThe effects themselves were certainly observed in all times. Even the\r\nphenomena of hypnotism date probably back some thousands of years,\r\nhowever difficult it may sometimes be to discriminate between the\r\nartificial hypnotic states and hysteric or hystero-epileptic occurrences\r\nin the past. Certainly it may be acknowledged that the Yogi in India\r\ncultivated in the most remote times the methods of autosuggestion which\r\nevidently led to hypnotic states, and everywhere around the\r\nMediterranean, antiquity knew the hypnotizing effect of staring on\r\npolished metals and crystals. So in Egypt, so in Greece and Rome; and it\r\nhas often been claimed that the priestesses of Delphi and the sibyls of\r\nthe Romans were in states of hystero-hypnotic character. As to the\r\ntherapeutic use, especially the Greek physicians applied hypnotic means.\r\nExcited patients were brought to repose by methods of stroking. The\r\nefforts to explain scientifically the mysterious powers which men can\r\ngain over the mind and will of another begin at the end of the Middle\r\nAge and were developed quite naturally from the prevailing astrological\r\ndoctrines. Astrology worked on the theory that the human fate depends\r\nupon the stars. These stars have an effect on the human organism. That\r\nproves that an influence can exist between distant bodies. It is,\r\ntherefore, not more surprising that one organism can also have an\r\ninfluence on another organism. Well known since antiquity were such\r\ninfluences from one object to another, as in the case of the magnet.\r\nThus there may be a kind of magnetic power which creates relations\r\nbetween all objects in the universe.\r\n\r\nPomponnazi explained thus at the end of the fifteenth century the\r\ntherapeutic effects of the human soul by the mutual influence which\r\nstars and men have on each other. This theory comes to much more\r\nimportant development in the writings of the physician Paracelsus. One\r\nindividual by the power of his effort can influence the will of another\r\nindividual, can fight with it, and suppress it; and all through energies\r\nwhich are analogous to the magnetic power which binds stars and men. In\r\nthe middle of the seventeenth century, Helmont connects this power of\r\nmagnetic attraction and repulsion with an ethereal element which\r\npenetrates all bodies and keeps them in motion. Through it man, too, can\r\nby his mere imagination work on other men. This will can also be\r\neffective on drugs which get through it a special therapeutic power.\r\nSomewhat different was the theory of a Scotch physician, Maxwell, in the\r\nsecond half of the seventeenth century. The ethereal spirit, which is\r\nidentical with light, can be artificially cumulated in any organism and\r\nthat secures its health. As one man can influence this vivifying ether\r\nin any other man, he can produce cures even from a great distance. All\r\ndiseases are merely reductions of this ethereal spirit in the organism.\r\n\r\nBut the general stream of the explanation continued in the direction of\r\nthe magnetic doctrine. It was especially Mesmer in the eighteenth\r\ncentury who, in a long life of fantastic mysticism and yet of universal\r\nserious study, surely contributed much to the development of the theory.\r\nHe had started to use, like others, the magnet in his medical practice.\r\nBut he discovered that the same therapeutic successes could be gained\r\nwithout applying the magnet itself, but by simply using his own hands.\r\nThe patients became cured when he moved his hands slowly from their\r\nheads to their feet. The magnetic power was therefore evidently in man\r\nhimself. It was an animal magnetism in opposition to the mineral one\r\nwhich belonged to the magnet and to the stars. He believed further that\r\nhe was able to infuse this magnetic power into any lifeless thing, which\r\nwould then have curative influence on the nerves. There can be no doubt\r\nthat, whatever may have been the value of his theories, he cured a large\r\nnumber of patients, evidently producing a state which we would call\r\ntoday a hypnoid state and often simply appealing to the natural\r\nsuggestibility of the impressionable minds. Among his pupils, usually\r\ncalled mesmerists, was Puysèyur, who discovered, in 1784, the state\r\nwhich was called artificial somnambulism, a kind of sleep in which the\r\nideas and feelings of the magnetized can be guided by the magnetizer.\r\nHere evidently was the first recognition of the psychotherapeutic\r\nvariation which we call today hypnotism. There followed a period in\r\nwhich the scientific interest of the physicians was somewhat sidetracked\r\nby an unsound connection of these studies with mystic speculations and\r\nwith clairvoyance. But especially in Germany animal magnetism in\r\nMesmer's form and in the form of artificial somnambulism grew in\r\ninfluence through the first decades of the nineteenth century and\r\nsucceeded in entering the medical schools. The reaction came through\r\npopular misuse. At about the third decade of the century, interest\r\nceased everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese Faria insisted in 1819, practically as the first, that\r\nall those so-called magnetic influences, including the delusions, the\r\namnesias after awaking, and the actions at a command, did not result\r\nfrom a magnetic power but from the imagination of the subject himself.\r\nHe believed that the effect depended upon a disposition of the\r\nindividual which resulted from a special thinness of blood. He abstained\r\ntherefore from the magnetic manipulations and produced the somnambulic\r\nstate by making the patients simply fixate his hands and by ordering\r\nthem to sleep. Thus he is the first who understood these changes as\r\nresults of mental suggestion. The next great step was due to the English\r\nsurgeon, Braid, who in the forties studied the magnetic phenomena and\r\nlike Faria insisted on the merely mental origin of the abnormal state.\r\nHe proved that a person can bring himself into such an artificial state\r\nand that it is therefore entirely independent of energies from without.\r\nHe examined especially the influence of staring at a shining object, a\r\nmethod which not seldom was called Braidism. He also introduced the\r\nword hypnotism. In America mesmerism was generally known under the\r\nname of electrobiology; and Grimes in particular came to results\r\nsimilar to those of Braid. Yet the influence of these movements on\r\nthe medical world remained insignificant until a new great wave of\r\npsychotherapeutics by means of suggestion began in France in the\r\nsixties.\r\n\r\nOf course this development from astrology to magnetism and from\r\nmagnetism to hypnotism represented only one side of psychotherapy.\r\nParallel to it goes the progress in the treatment of the insane. In the\r\nfirst half of the eighteenth century, they are still on the whole thrown\r\ntogether with the criminals but the more the disease character of the\r\ndisturbance is acknowledged, and the more special hospitals for the\r\ninsane are created, and finally the more the humane treatment in them\r\nsupersedes the brutal, the more psychotherapy enters into the work.\r\nEngland showed the way. Especially Arnold, Crichton, and Perfect became\r\ninfluential; and soon Pinel and Esquirol followed in France; and Reil\r\nand Langermann in Germany. Reil recognized clearly at the threshold of\r\nthe nineteenth century that \"Both psychical and physical diseases may be\r\ncured by psychical means, but at the same time psychical diseases may\r\nalso be cured by physical means.\" And in his \"Rhapsodies,\" rhapsodies on\r\nthe application of psychical methods in the treatment of mental\r\ndisturbances, he declared, \"that the medical Faculties will soon be\r\nobliged to add to the two existing medical degrees still a third,\r\nnamely, the doctorate in psychotherapy.\" This stream became broader and\r\nbroader and every new development of psychiatry in the last hundred\r\nyears did new justice to the influence of psychological means in the\r\ntreatment of mental diseases; to be sure, without allowing up to the\r\npresent day the hope that mental factors as such can cure the grave\r\nforms of insanity. The borderland cases and the incipient mild forms\r\nalone allow the hope of a cure. Outside of them the work of\r\npsychotherapy in the insane asylum meant essentially improvement and\r\nrelief only. Again, in another direction, the general dietetic influence\r\nof sound mental life may be called a part of psychotherapy and this\r\nengaged not a few of the leading medical thinkers in all countries\r\nduring the last century, especially the nerve physicians who gave\r\nserious attention to the wholesome engagements of the mind. Finally,\r\nmight not much be attributed to psychotherapy, which offically belongs\r\nto the doctrines of homeopathy?\r\n\r\nBut we may return to the new heralds of suggestion. Liébeault's book on\r\nthe artificial sleep in 1866 became the starting point of the new great\r\nmovement. Yet at first it remained unnoticed. It is claimed that for a\r\nlong time only one copy was sold. But he continued to make his hypnotic\r\nexperiments on the poor population of Nancy and they finally attracted\r\nthe attention of some of the leading medical men there. Bernheim became\r\nconvinced and Dumont, the physiologist Beaunis joined the movement, and\r\nin the eighties we find Nancy the center of hypnotic interest to which\r\nmedical men from everywhere made their pilgrimage. This latter phase was\r\nparalleled by Charcot's studies in Paris, who brought hypnotism into\r\nnearest neighborhood with hysteria. And also the later development of\r\nthe Paris school by Richer, and especially the brilliant work of Janet,\r\nkept hysteria in the foreground of the therapeutic interest. Liébeault's\r\nexperiment had brought the psychology of suggestion entirely into the\r\ncenter of this whole circle of phenomena and this view controlled the\r\ndevelopment of the last few decades, which was essentially an\r\nelaboration of the special treatment of diseases. Forel in Switzerland,\r\nMoll and Vogt in Germany, Wetterstrand in Sweden became the chief\r\nexponents of therapy by hypnotism. Others, like Dubois, in Switzerland,\r\nemphasized more the suggestive treatment through persuasion. In England\r\nat first Carpenter, later Hack-Tuke gave serious attention to hypnotism,\r\nin Russia Bechterew, and in the last few years the literature on therapy\r\nby suggestion became developed in practically all countries. In America\r\nBeard, Hammond, and others belong to the older school; Osgood, Prince,\r\nPeterson, Putnam, Sidis, and others to the most recent years. At the\r\nsame time, under the leadership of Kraepelin, Ziehen, Sommer, and\r\nothers, the methods of the psychological laboratory, especially the\r\nreaction and association methods, were made useful for the purposes of\r\npsychopathology.\r\n\r\nBut interest in suggestion does not represent to-day the last step of\r\npsychotherapy. The latest movement, which is entirely in its beginning,\r\nthe development of which no one can foresee, but which promises wide\r\nperspectives, is connected with the name of Freud in Vienna. The\r\nentirely new turn of psychotherapy is given by the fact that his aim is\r\nnot to overcome a symptom by suggestion but to make it disappear by\r\nremoving the ultimate mental cause. He found that large groups of mental\r\ndisturbances result from a psychical trauma, a disagreeable idea which,\r\ninhibited in the mind, becomes the source of mischief and produces\r\nphobias and obsessions and hysterical motions. The cure of the symptoms\r\ndemands the recognition of this first mental accident, which may lie\r\nback for years and which may no longer be in the memory of the patient.\r\nAs soon as this earlier experience is brought to consciousness again, it\r\nneeds only a natural discharge and a normal expression and the symptoms\r\nwhich it brought about will disappear. Thus the cure itself needs no\r\nhypnotism and no persuasion or suggestion but the reawakening of\r\nforgotten situations, and only in the service of this effort hypnotism\r\nmay be used to reënforce the memory. Yet this represents only the first\r\nperiod of Freud's activity, in which he collaborated with Breuer, a\r\nphase which is represented by their book on hysteria, in 1895. But there\r\nfollowed a further development which is still more essential. The\r\nhysterical disturbance may indeed have started with such an accidental\r\ntraumatic impression but that does not explain why just this impression\r\nhad such a strong effect. Other impressions of equal strength and\r\nemotional vividness may have passed without leaving any damaging result.\r\nAnd therefore there must be some prior cause in the subject which makes\r\njust this particular impression so injurious; and here is the point of\r\nFreud's fundamental discovery, which for the layman appears on the\r\nsurface to have little probability but which has proved of greatest\r\nconsequence for clinical work. It was found that only those situations\r\nbecome injurious and become starting points for hysterical symptoms\r\nwhich touch on repressed and artificially inhibited ideas of the sexual\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\nEntirely new perspectives have been opened by these studies. Above all,\r\nnow for the first time there is in sight a psychotherapy which not only\r\naims to remove symptoms but which really uproots the disease itself.\r\nThat earlier method of bringing the trauma to consciousness and making\r\nit discharge, the so-called cathartic method, removes only the\r\nparticular group of disturbances but the patient remains a hysteric, and\r\nif ever new accidents should happen which would touch again those inmost\r\nrepressed ideas, new hysterical symptoms would develop. But if we can go\r\nback to that starting point, if we can discover those first suppressions\r\nof desired gratifications which often most indirectly are related to the\r\nsexual sphere, and if we can liberate the mind from those primary\r\nstrangulated affections, then the patient is really cured. Freud himself\r\npractically abstained from the help which hypnotism can give for the\r\nreawakening of forgotten experiences, while some of his pupils still\r\nprefer this short way to the forgotten memories. His way is, on the\r\nwhole, to let the imagination bring up any chance material of associated\r\nideas and then to study their connections and follow the hints they\r\ngive. He calls it the psychoanalytic method. Others prefer the methods\r\nof association tests, again others tap the lower layers by automatic\r\nwriting, but the chief problem remains always to discover those\r\nrepressed desires and to understand through them the injurious effects\r\nof accidental experiences. The whole field of hysteria, and perhaps\r\nstill more that of the anxiety neurosis, has come into new perspective\r\nthrough this pioneer work which men like Bleuler, Jung, and Stekel have\r\ndeveloped in various directions.\r\n\r\nThus in recent decades the thorough work of scientific physicians has\r\ndeveloped a psychotherapy of considerable extent and of indubitable\r\nusefulness, far removed from the simultaneous efforts of the churches\r\nand of the popular mental healing cures. A number of eminent men in all\r\ncountries have tested the methods and have published the results. But\r\nthe curious side of it is that all this is essentially a movement of\r\nleaders while the masses of the profession hesitate to follow. It is a\r\nset of officers without an army. Every large city has one or another\r\nspecialist who applies suggestive therapy, one or another nerve\r\nspecialist who hypnotizes, but the average physician moves on without\r\nany serious effort to utilize psychotherapy. It is as if the\r\nprescription of the modern chemical drugs were confined to some leading\r\nscholars in the country, while the thousands abstained from it in their\r\noffice work and in their family practice. In reality psychotherapy ought\r\nto be used by every physician, as it fits perfectly the needs of the\r\nwhole suffering community. Its almost exceptional use in the hands of a\r\nfew scholarly leaders deprives it of its true importance. It is the\r\nvillage doctor who needs psychotherapy much more than he needs the knife\r\nand the electric current.\r\n\r\nWhy does the medical profession on the whole show this shyness in the\r\nface of such surprising results? In other fields they do not show any\r\nreluctance in taking up the newer developments of method. Even the\r\nRoentgen ray apparatus has quickly won its way, and psychotherapy is\r\nless expensive. To be sure, the most important reason is probably one\r\nwhich is most honorable. The physicians do not like to touch a tool\r\nwhich has been misused so badly. Psychotherapy has come too much into\r\nthe neighborhood of superstition and humbug. Where miracles are\r\nperformed, the man of science prefers to leave the field. The less one\r\nknows about those groups of problems, the less one is able to see the\r\nsharp demarcation line between true scientific studies, for instance, in\r\nhypnotism, and the pseudo-scientific fancies of psychical research.\r\nExperiments in suggestibility are then easily mixed with experiments in\r\ntelepathy, and those go over by gradual degrees to clairvoyance and\r\npremonitory apparitions, and from there the way is not far to the\r\nreappearance of the dead and the routine performances of the spiritists.\r\nIt seems to many as if there is no point where they have a reason to\r\nstop. If they begin with such abnormal phenomena at all, it seems as if\r\nthey are necessarily carried over to all the mysteries of supernatural\r\nenergies. Even the competition with Christian Science, and other mental\r\nhealers whose judgment is not hampered by any previous study of\r\nmedicine, might seem rather unattractive to the serious physician.\r\n\r\nFurther not a few have the impression that such suggestive treatment\r\ndirectly demands from them that they also begin to humbug their patients\r\nor to throw out suggestions which they themselves do not believe, in\r\nshort, that they be brought down to the level of the miracle performer.\r\nYet, however much all that speaks in favor of the conscientious instinct\r\nin the physician, it is ultimately based upon a misinterpretation. The\r\nline between real science and its counterfeit is here as everywhere a\r\ndistinct one, and the true man of science ought not to hesitate in doing\r\nhis duty from fear that he might not be discriminated from the\r\ncharlatan. A well-conducted psychotherapeutic treatment as a scientific\r\nphysician ought to carry it out, is entirely different in meaning and\r\nappearance, from the first step of diagnosis to the last treatment of\r\nafter-effects, from every unscientific faith cure. It is also in no way\r\nnecessary that the psychotherapist ever leave the path of complete\r\nsincerity. There is no reason at all for promising that the patient will\r\nbe entirely cured if the physician believes that a real cure through\r\nsuggestion is impossible. The more the true physicians undertake\r\npsychotherapeutic work, the more it will carry with it that dignity\r\nwhich is now too often lost by the predominance of those who treat\r\nwithout diagnosis and cure by mere appeal to superstition.\r\n\r\nAll that does not mean that other motives do not hold the physician\r\nback. Not seldom he is afraid of unfavorable consequences. He does not\r\nfeel sure that, for instance, a deep hypnosis is without dangerous\r\nresults or that he will be able to produce it in the technically correct\r\nway. But all these objections mean nothing but insufficient acquaintance\r\nwith the facts. Of course every technique needs its period of\r\npreparation for the task, but it is now sufficiently demonstrated that\r\nhypnotism carried through in a scientific spirit will never have any\r\ninjurious consequences. The morphine injection and the Roentgen rays are\r\nby far more dangerous. Those who think that for hypnotizing especially\r\ninborn power is needed stand, of course, outside of a serious\r\ndiscussion. They do not even know the elements of the modern theories.\r\nEvery physician has in himself the necessary means for a\r\npsychotherapeutic treatment in every form.\r\n\r\nMore scientific insight belongs to the argument that most of these\r\npsychotherapeutic schemes are essentially for treatment of symptoms. We\r\nhave acknowledged that throughout. The possibility of a relapse or of a\r\nnew obsession is thus to a high degree open, and that is certainly a\r\ndiscouraging feature. Yet we have seen sufficiently that as soon as the\r\nsymptoms are removed, there is no lack of means, also by psychotherapy,\r\nto prevent the recurrence. Moreover, to remove the present symptoms is\r\nin any case a great gain and in many cases a decisive gain. And whatever\r\ncan be secured by such methods is of such a character that hardly any\r\nother method could have been substituted. It can be said with certainty\r\nthat hundreds of thousands leave the offices of their doctors every year\r\nwithout relief where relief could be secured by psychotherapeutic means.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, one reply of the physicians is not infrequent and carries\r\nsome weight. Psychotherapeutic methods demand much time and patience and\r\nskill. To relieve a cocainist of his desire by mere suggestion may\r\ndemand an assiduity which the average physician simply cannot afford;\r\nand nothing requires more time than a real use of Freud's psychoanalytic\r\nmethod. Hours and hours of conversation about the most trivial\r\noccurrences have to be spent to relieve the repressed ideas and to give\r\nthem a chance for a free ascension. It cannot be denied that most of the\r\nreally illuminating work in all these fields has been done by scholars\r\nwho combine a strong theoretical interest with their effort to cure the\r\npatients, and who therefore examine and treat the individual case\r\nprimarily from the wish to get new insight into the laws of nature. The\r\naverage physician whose time is his income may be the less willing to\r\nenter into such time-devouring schemes, as the patients too easily may\r\nthink that the physician did not do much for them when he simply was\r\nsitting down and gossiping with them.\r\n\r\nYet after all, behind all of it stands one motive which has held back\r\nthe development of psychotherapy in the medical profession more than\r\nanything else. The physician feels instinctively that a real success can\r\nbe reached in every one of these fields, only if he possesses a\r\nreasonable amount of knowledge of psychology. He feels that wherever he\r\ntouches the patient's body, examines his lungs or his heart or his\r\nreflexes, that a large background of anatomical knowledge and of general\r\npathology gives meaning to every single observation. But in the field of\r\nmental abnormities, in the whole world of ideas and emotions and\r\nvolitions, he simply lacks that background. Everything seems to him\r\nwithout reference to real knowledge. He feels as amateurish as if he\r\nwere to operate on the abdomen without knowing its anatomy. He is\r\ninstinctively aware that even the simplest mental life represents a\r\nbewildering complexity and that to stimulate ideas or feelings or to\r\nsuppress emotions, to inhibit volitions, must demand always a most\r\nsubtle disentanglement of the most widely different components. He\r\nabstains from approaching that ground at all rather than to blunder by\r\nhis ignorance of psychology. And after all, he is right. But is he right\r\nin allowing that ignorance? Can the medical profession afford to send\r\ninto the world every year thousands of young doctors who are unable to\r\nuse some of the most effective tools of modern medicine, and tools which\r\ndo not belong to the specialist but just to the average practitioner,\r\nsimply because they have not learned any psychology?\r\n\r\nIndeed the times seem ripe for a systematic introduction of\r\npsychological studies into every regular medical course. It is not a\r\nquestion of mental research in the psychological laboratory where\r\nadvanced work is carried on, but a solid foundation in empirical\r\npsychology can be demanded of everyone. He ought to have as much\r\npsychology as he has physiology. Moreover the psychological study ought\r\nnot to be confined to the normal mental life. Again we do not speak of\r\npsychiatry. What is needed is abnormal psychology, entirely independent\r\nof the therapeutic interests of the alienist. The mental variations\r\nwithin the limits of normal life and the borderland cases ought to be\r\nstudied there as well as the complete derangements. The ideal demand\r\nwould be that the future physician should spend at least a year of his\r\nundergraduate time on empirical psychology, especially on experimental\r\nand physiological psychology. He would take perhaps half a year's\r\nlecture course on the whole field of psychology as covered in the\r\nEnglish language by the well-known text-books of James, Wundt,\r\nTitchener, Judd, Royce, Calkins, Angell, Baldwin, Kuelpe, Ebbinghaus,\r\nThorndike, Stout, Ziehen, Ladd, and so on. In the second half-year the\r\ncourse ought to be either advanced psychology entering into the more\r\ncomplex phenomena or a practical training course in elementary\r\nlaboratory psychology as indicated for instance by Titchener's\r\n\"Experimental Psychology. A Manual of Laboratory Practice.\" If the\r\nundergraduate can possibly afford the time in his college course, he\r\nought to add courses which either lead him towards the philosophical\r\nproblems of psychology or towards the comparative aspect of psychology.\r\nIf he can find time for a year of post-graduate work between college and\r\nmedical school, he could hardly spend it more profitably than by a year\r\nof research in a well-conducted psychological laboratory to become\r\nreally acquainted with an independent analysis of mental states. On the\r\nother hand in the medical school, room must be found for a course in\r\nabnormal psychology, which of course presupposes a thorough knowledge of\r\nnormal psychology and, if possible, follows the courses on nervous\r\ndiseases and precedes the course on psychiatry.\r\n\r\nFor the average future physician, it would be wiser to omit even the\r\npsychiatry studies than those in abnormal psychology. The latter ought\r\nto lead him far enough to discriminate early between a mere\r\nneurasthenia, for instance, and a beginning of insanity. As soon as the\r\ndiscrimination is perfected and insanity is found, he has to give the\r\ncase out of his care anyhow and hand it over to the specialist and to\r\nthe asylum. The knowledge of psychiatric treatment is, therefore, not\r\nessential for the average practitioner. But no one can relieve him from\r\nthe responsibility for those borderland cases, for the hysterias and\r\npsychasthenias and neurasthenias, and he can never master them without\r\nnormal and abnormal psychology. Moreover it must not be forgotten that\r\nmental factors may enter into every disease. The psychology of pain, for\r\ninstance, and of comfort feeling, the psychology of hunger and thirst,\r\nof nausea and dizziness, the psychology of the sexual feelings, the\r\npsychology of hope and fear, of confidence and discouragement, of\r\nlaziness and energy, of sincerity and cunningness play their rôle in\r\nalmost every sick room. And if the physician haughtily declares that he\r\ndoes not care for the methods of suggestion, it might justly be asked\r\nwhether he can be a physician at all if he does not apply some\r\nsuggestions; yes, if his very entrance into the sick room does not\r\nsuggest relief and improvement from the start. The introduction of a\r\nserious study of psychology is the most immediate need of the medical\r\ncurriculum. Instructorships in abnormal psychology must be created in\r\nevery medical school; institutes for psychotherapy should soon follow.\r\nBut in all this, there is nowhere to appear any artificial antithesis\r\nbetween mind and body, any more than between organic and functional\r\ndiseases; we have discussed all that with full detail. Only the\r\nphysician who has a thorough psychological preparation can fulfill the\r\nmanifold demands which modern life must raise; he alone is prepared to\r\ncoöperate with the other factors of the community in the development of\r\na sound and healthful nation, to work towards the hygiene of the nervous\r\nsystem and of the mental life; and to correct the injuries which the\r\nperversities of our civilization inflict.\r\n\r\nIn all that he will not avoid the comradeship of the clergyman. He will,\r\nof course, not forget the fundamental difference of attitude between\r\nthem, he will not forget that the minister seeks for the meaning and\r\nvalues of inner life while he, the physician, has to consider that same\r\ninner life from a causal point of view and thus has to work with it as\r\nwith natural material for the normal functioning of the organism. But\r\nthe interrelation between them can be intimate in spite of the\r\ndifference of their standpoints. The minister, to be sure, ought not to\r\nconsider health as such as the greatest good, but he will not forget\r\nthat a wholesome devotion to ideals cannot be carried through when the\r\nattention is absorbed by the sufferings of the body and the mental\r\npowers are debilitated. Only in a sound mind the full ideal meanings of\r\nlife can be realized. The minister must therefore seek the health of his\r\ncongregation not because health is the ideal of life but because the\r\ntrue ideals cannot be appreciated by the mental cripple. On the other\r\nhand, the physician from his standpoint should in no way feel it his\r\nduty to play the amateur minister and to put emphasis on the spiritual\r\nuplifting of his patients. But he knows well that not a few of the\r\nsuggestive influences which are needed for the relief from disease are\r\nmost effective when an emotional emphasis can be given to the\r\nsuggestions and that this emphasis is for large numbers most powerfully\r\nsupplied by the religious emotion. Thus the minister will be a very\r\nimportant assistant to him and the church will most successfully do for\r\nmany patients what for other patients perhaps travel or music or the\r\ntheatre, sport or social life, may do.\r\n\r\nJust in the relation to the church, the physician will need subtlest\r\ndiscrimination, and he will not forget that while even a strong\r\nreligious emotion may be without damage for a normal man, it may well be\r\ninjurious to the unstable brain. But if the physician uses tact and\r\nwisdom, he will be surprised to find how often the religious stimulation\r\ncan indeed be helpful for his purposes and the division of labor\r\ndemands that this be supplied not by himself but by the minister. He\r\nwill advise the consulting sufferer to seek the influence of a godly man\r\nwho awakens in him upbuilding wholesome emotions and volitions. The\r\nminister may in this way very well become the assistant of the\r\nphysician. But whether this coöperation is looked on from the one or\r\nfrom the other point of view, in every case it needs absolute clearness.\r\nNothing is gained and too much is lost if the two functions are\r\ncarelessly mixed together. It is never the task of the minister to heal\r\na mind and never the task of a physician to uplift a mind. One moves in\r\nthe purposive sphere, the other in the causal sphere. Their friendship\r\ncan seriously endure only as long as they remain conscious of the fact\r\nthat they have two entirely different functions in the service of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nPSYCHOTHERAPY AND THE COMMUNITY\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth the physician and the patient find their place in the community the\r\nlife interests of which are superior to the interests of the individual.\r\nIt is an unavoidable question how far from the higher point of view of\r\nthe social mind the psychotherapeutic efforts should be encouraged or\r\nsuppressed. Are there any conditions which suggest suspicion of or\r\ndirect opposition to such curative work?\r\n\r\nOf course society has to be sure that no possible misuse and damage are\r\nto result from such practice. Fears in that direction have been uttered\r\nrepeatedly, but from very different standpoints. One which is perhaps\r\nmost often heard in popular circles results from an entire\r\nmisunderstanding and deserves hardly any discussion after our detailed\r\nstudy of the processes involved. It is claimed that suggestive power,\r\nespecially in the form of hypnotization, may be secretly misused to make\r\nanyone without his knowledge and against his will a passive instrument\r\nof the hypnotist's intent. Often this is coupled with telepathic\r\nfancies. The hypnotist is believed to have mystic power to bring any\r\nperson in a distant region under his mental control and thus to be able\r\nto carry out any sinister plans by the help of his innocent victim. All\r\nhypnotizing therefore ought to be interdicted by the state. The\r\npresuppositions of such a view are, as we know now, entirely absurd. We\r\nknow that hypnotism is not based on any special power of the hypnotizer;\r\nthere is no magnetic fluid in the sense of the old mesmerism. The\r\nimagination of the hypnotized person is the only hypnotizing agency.\r\nThus no one can be hypnotized without his knowledge or against his will.\r\nThe story of telepathic mysteries which is often brought before the\r\npublic is probably always the outcome of a diseased brain. It is indeed\r\na frequent symptom in paranoia and other insanities that the patient who\r\nfeels abnormal organic sensations and abnormal unaccountable impulses\r\ninterprets them as influences of a distant enemy. Whole pamphlets have\r\nbeen written with elaboration of such insane misinterpretations and\r\nrequests to legislatures have been made in that spirit, but the\r\nphysician recognizes easily throughout the whole argumentation the\r\nwell-known phenomena of the mental disease.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, while no one can be hypnotized against his will, many a\r\nperson is liable to accept suggestions from others and thus to carry out\r\nthe wishes of others almost without knowing and certainly without\r\nwilling that the other mind interfere with the interplay of the own\r\nmotives. But if we were to strike out all suggestive influences from\r\nsocial life, we should give up social life itself. Suggestion is given\r\nwherever men come in contact; in itself it is neither good nor bad. The\r\ngood resolution and the bad one can be suggested, the good example and\r\nthe bad can be effective; both encouragement of the noble and imitation\r\nof the evil may work with the same mental technique. Certainly there are\r\nsome persons who have a stronger influence than others on the\r\nimagination of those with whom they come in contact; their expression\r\nawakens confidence, their voice and their words reach deeper layers of\r\nthe mind, their calmness and firmness overwhelm more easily the\r\nantagonistic ideas. But the chief difference lies after all in the\r\ndifferent degrees of suggestibility among those who receive such\r\nimpressions. The easily suggestible person cannot be protected by any\r\ninterdict; he may catch suggestions everywhere, any advertisement in the\r\nnewspaper and any display in the shop-window may overrun his own\r\nintentions. What he needs is training in firmness. The application of\r\nreënforced suggestion or even of hypnotism in the doctor's office is\r\neven for him no possible source of danger.\r\n\r\nOn a higher level are objections which come from serious quarters and\r\nwhich are not without sympathy with true science. In recent times this\r\nopposition has repeatedly found eloquent expression. It is an objection\r\nfrom the standpoint of morality, belonging therefore entirely to the\r\npurposive view of the mind, but we have now reached a point where it is\r\nour duty to do justice to this purposive view too. As long as we\r\ndiscussed the problem entirely from the standpoint of the physician, no\r\nother view of mental life except the causal one could be in question. As\r\nsoon as we look at it from the standpoint of the community, it becomes\r\nour duty to bring the causal and the purposive view into harmony, and it\r\nwould be narrow and short-sighted simply to draw the practical\r\nconsequences of a naturalistic view of the mind without inquiring\r\nwhether or not serious interests in the purposive sphere are injured. If\r\nthere is moral criticism against suggestive therapy, it is the duty of\r\nthe community to consider it. This opposition argues as follows:\r\nHypnotic influence brings the patient under the will control of the\r\nhypnotizer and thus destroys his own freedom. Whatever the patient may\r\nreach in the altered states is reached without his own effort, while he\r\nis the passive receiver of the other man's will. His achievement has\r\ntherefore no moral value, and if he is really cured of his drunkenness\r\nor of his perverse habits, of his misuse of cocaine or of his criminal\r\ntendencies, he has lost the right to be counted a moral agent. It would\r\nbe better if there were more suffering in the world than that the\r\nexistence of the moral will should be undermined.\r\n\r\nNo one ought to take such arguments lightly. The spirit which directs\r\nthem is needed more than anything else in our time of reaching out for\r\nsuperficial goods. No one can insist too earnestly that life is worth\r\nliving only if it serves moral duties and moral freedom and is not\r\ndetermined by pleasures and absence of pain only. Those who set forth\r\nthis argument are entirely willing to acknowledge the profound effect\r\nwhich suggestive therapeutics may create. More than this, they have to\r\nacknowledge it to gain a basis for their attack. Just because the\r\nhypnotizer can entirely change the desires and passions, the habits and\r\nperversities of the suffering victim, he seems to them a moral wrongdoer\r\nwho negates the principle of human freedom. A forcible book of recent\r\ndays calls the suggestive power of the psychotherapist \"The Great\r\nPsychological Crime.\" It says to the hypnotist: \"By your own testimony,\r\nyou stand convicted of applying a process which deprives your subjects\r\nof the inalienable right and power of individual self-control. In\r\nproportion as you deprive him of the power of self-control, you deprive\r\nhim of that upon which his individual responsibility and moral status\r\ndepend. In proportion as you deprive him of the free control and\r\nexercise of those powers of the soul upon which his individual\r\nresponsibility and moral status depend, you thereby rob him of those\r\npowers upon which he must depend for the achievement of individual\r\nimmortality.\"\r\n\r\nBut this censure too is entirely mistaken, not because it urges the\r\npurposive views against the causal but because it is in error as to the\r\nfacts. Such critics are fully under the influence of the startling\r\nresults which are reached; they do not take the trouble to examine the\r\nlong and difficult way which has had to be traversed with patience and\r\nenergy. It is quite true that if I hypnotize a man and suggest to him to\r\ntake up after awaking the book which lies on my table, he follows my\r\nsuggestion without conflict and in a certain sense without freedom. He\r\nfeels a simple impulse to go to the table and lift the book and, as no\r\nstronger natural desire and no moral objection stand in the way, he\r\ncarries out that meaningless impulse and perhaps even invents a foolish\r\nmotive to explain to himself why he wanted to look at that book. But\r\nafter a long experience, I have my doubts as to whether a man was ever\r\ncured in such a way by hypnotism of serious disturbances and of those\r\nanomalous actions which the critics want to see overcome by the\r\npatient's own moral efforts. On the contrary, every suggestion has to\r\nrely on the efforts and struggles of the patient himself and all that\r\nthe psychotherapists can give him is help in his own moral fight. His\r\nown will is presupposition for being hypnotized and for realizing the\r\nsuggestion. If again and again I hesitate to undertake new cases, it is\r\njust because I have to see during the treatment too much of this daily\r\nand hourly striving against overpowering impulses. The joy of removing\r\nsome obstacles from the way of the patients is too much overshadowed by\r\nthe deep pity and sympathy with their suffering and craving during the\r\nwhole period of successive treatments. To make a man fight where despair\r\nis inevitable, and where the enemy is necessarily stronger than his own\r\npowers, can certainly not be the moral demand. Morality postulates that\r\neveryone find conditions in which he can be victorious if he puts his\r\nstrongest efforts to the task.\r\n\r\nIn our discussion of the mental symptoms I reported as an illustration\r\nof the suggestive treatment of the drug passion the case of a\r\nmorphinist. To make clear this purposive side of the case as against the\r\ncausal one which alone interested the physician, I may add a few\r\nfeatures to the short report as a typical example. When that man left my\r\nlaboratory for the last time to go out to work and happiness, you might\r\nwell have believed from his joyful face that it had been an easy and\r\npleasant time in which hypnotic influence smoothly removed from him the\r\ndangerous desire for morphine. In truth it was the result of four months\r\nof the most noble and courageous suffering and struggling. He had been\r\nfor years a slave to his passion. To quote from his little\r\nautobiography: \"When I realized that I was addicted to morphine, I was\r\nat first not at all worried as I did not then understand the real horror\r\nof the thing, and did not then realize all the future suffering and\r\nmisery that is coming to anyone who is the user of opium or any of its\r\nalkaloids. For the first few months, I found great relief after every\r\ninjection of morphine, but soon I could not get the same easy feeling\r\nand could eat but very little and what sleep I got was in the daytime. I\r\nfinally went to the sanitarium of a doctor but it was simply a\r\nmoney-making business for him; if he ever cured anyone, I never heard of\r\nit. I then tried another one; it was the same kind of a place as the\r\nformer. When I first went to see the professor in the Harvard\r\nPsychological Laboratory, I was using between thirty-two and\r\nthirty-eight grains of morphine daily. He put me under his treatment\r\nOctober 6th and that day cut me down by hypnotic treatment to nine\r\ngrains a day or three doses of three grains a day. I took my hypodermic\r\nas directed, but on the following day I lay on the bed too exhausted to\r\nget up even to get around the room, and I could not eat and only drank a\r\nvery little water. The desire for the drug was something terrible. But\r\nin about four days I got used to the loss of so much morphine and stayed\r\non this amount for a week, seeing the professor every other day for\r\nhypnotic treatment and then returning to my room where I spent\r\ntwenty-two hours of the twenty-four on the bed, but did not sleep more\r\nthan two or three hours a day. At the end of the week I was cut off by\r\nhypnotic suggestion half a grain and this put me to fighting the desire\r\nagain. This lasted two or three days and then I began to feel better and\r\nbegan to sleep a little more. But at the end of the week I was cut off\r\nanother half grain, and the whole fight would have to be begun over.\r\nThese reductions of the dose were made a week apart and sometimes only\r\ntwo days. The worst time of all was a cut from four injections of a\r\nfourth of a grain each to four of one eighth of a grain each, which was\r\nabout January 10th. At this time I had the worst two days of my life. I\r\ntried whiskey, but it gave relief only for about half an hour and then\r\nthe desire was worse than ever.\"\r\n\r\nIn this way every few days I gave the poor fellow under hypnotic\r\ninfluence the suggestion to reduce the dose of morphine in a prescribed\r\nway, and with enormous effort he withstood his craving for more, in\r\nspite of the fact that he had during all this winter a bottle with a\r\nthousand tablets of morphine, prescribed by an unscrupulous physician,\r\nin his writing desk. He was thus at every moment during the day and\r\nnight in full possession of the deadly poison with which he could have\r\nfully satisfied his craving. It was a moral victory when he finally\r\nreached the point at which he went for several weeks without any desire\r\nfor morphine and finally presented the remaining tablets to a hospital.\r\nAnd yet there would not have been the least chance for his winning this\r\nethical victory without the outer help of the hypnotist. We do not\r\neliminate the moral will but we remove some unfair obstacles from its\r\npath. We have no mystic power by which our will simply takes hold of the\r\nother man's will, but we inhibit and suppress by influence on the\r\nimagination those abnormal impulses which resist the sound desires. If\r\nthat were immoral, we should have to make up our minds that all\r\neducation and training were perverted with such immoral elements. Every\r\nsound respect for authority which makes a child willing to accept the\r\nadvice and maxims of his elders is just such an influence. If it were\r\nreally a moral demand that the will be left to its own resources and\r\nthat no outside influence come to strengthen its power or remove its\r\nhindrances or smooth its path, then we ought to let the children grow up\r\nas nature created them and ought not to try to suppress from without by\r\ndiscipline and training, by love and encouragement, the willful\r\nimpulses and the ugly habits. Even every good model for imitation is\r\nsuch a suggestive influence from without and every solemn appeal to\r\nloyalty and friendship, to patriotism and religion, increases the degree\r\nof suggestibility. That is the glory of life that the suggestive power\r\nmay belong to moral values instead of mere pleasures, but it is not the\r\naim of life to remain untouched by suggestion. And he who by suggestion\r\nhelps the weak mind to overcome obstacles which the strong mind can\r\noverthrow from its inborn resources works for the good of the individual\r\nand of the community in the spirit of truest morality.\r\n\r\nMuch more justified than such ethical objections are the fears which\r\nmove entirely in the causal sphere. It must be acknowledged that a\r\nmethod which has such powerful influence over the mind that it can\r\nsecure ideas and emotions and impulses which the own will of the patient\r\ncannot produce, ought to be allowed only to those who are prepared for\r\nits skillful use. To hypnotize or to perform any persistent\r\npsychotherapeutic treatment may thus be dangerous, if it is done by the\r\nunfit. We have discussed before the injuries which might result from the\r\nadministration of such powerful psychotherapeutic effects through the\r\nbest meaning minister, but we can extend this fear to anyone who has not\r\nsystematically studied medicine and to a certain degree normal and\r\nabnormal psychology. The possibilities of overlooking symptoms which\r\nought to suggest an entirely different treatment, or of adjusting the\r\ntreatment badly to the special physical conditions, or of ignoring the\r\ndesirable physical supplement by drugs, or of creating unintentionally\r\nby suggestion injurious effects, are always open when medical amateurs\r\nundertake such work. Certainly there is no physician who is not liable\r\nto make mistakes, and a physician who has never given any attention to\r\npsychology and psychiatry would also be a rather poor agent of\r\npsychotherapeutic methods, but the probability is that such a physician\r\nwould simply abstain by principle from all psychotherapeutic methods;\r\nhis mistake only begins if from his lack of acquaintance with the\r\nsubject he draws the conclusion that the method itself is undesirable.\r\nThat his real preparation ought to include psychological studies we have\r\npointed out before, and the time seems ripe for the community to urge\r\nsuch a reform of the studies.\r\n\r\nAll that involves the conviction that even the experimental psychologist\r\nas such is not prepared to enter into medical treatment; and a\r\n\"Psychological Clinic,\" managed by a psychologist who is not a doctor of\r\nmedicine, is certainly not better than a church clinic. I cannot even\r\nacknowledge the right of psychologists to make hypnotic experiments\r\nmerely for the psychological experiment's sake. Nobody ought to be\r\nbrought into a hypnotic or otherwise abnormal state of mind if it is not\r\nsuggested by the interests of the subject himself. Science has the right\r\nto make hypnotic experiments, or experiments with abnormal mental\r\nstates, only under the one condition that a physician has hypnotized the\r\nsubject in the interests of his health and that the patient has agreed\r\nbeforehand to allow in the presence of witnesses certain psychological\r\nstudies. Needless to say that any hypnotization for mere amusement and\r\nas a parlor trick ought to be considered as criminal.\r\n\r\nOn some other objections which interest the community as such we had to\r\ntouch before, and there is no need of returning to them with any\r\nfullness of argument. We spoke of the danger which the mental cures\r\ncarry with them when they are based on any particular creed, and\r\nespecially when they are tied up with a semi-religious arbitrary\r\nmetaphysics. What is gained if some nervous disorders are helped by\r\nbelief, if the belief itself devastates our intellectual culture and\r\nbrings the masses down again to a view of the world which has all the\r\nearmarks of barbarism? That is indeed one of the central dangers of all\r\nnon-medical suggestive cures, that while any belief may cure through the\r\nmere emotional power of the act of believing, the content of the belief\r\ngains an undeserved appearance of truth. Any absurd superstition can\r\nbecome accredited because its curative value may be equal to a truly\r\nvaluable suggestion. The intellectual life of the community would have\r\nto suffer greatly if the way to be freed from bodily suffering had to be\r\nthe belief in the metaphysical doctrines of Mrs. Eddy's \"Science and\r\nHealth.\" From a cultural viewpoint, too, suggestive therapeutics must\r\nstand the higher, the more sharply it is separated from special\r\nphilosophical or religious doctrines. No theory of the world and of God\r\nought to gain authority over the mind from such an external motive as a\r\nbelief in its curative effects. Freest from such implications is\r\ncertainly the hypnotic method of the physician who does not need the\r\nstrong religious reënforcement of the suggestion because he reënforces\r\ninstead the suggestibility of the patient by slight influences on his\r\nsenses.\r\n\r\nEven where sound religion without superstition and without\r\npseudophilosophy stands behind the therapeutic work, the community will\r\nnot give up the question whether the church does not necessarily neglect\r\nby it the interests which are superior. The community becomes more and\r\nmore strongly aware that too many factors of our modern society urge the\r\nchurch to undertake non-religious work. Social aid and charity work\r\nought to be filled with religious spirit, but to perform it is not\r\nitself religion. Still more that is true of the healing of the sick.\r\nWhether or not such expansion of church activity in different directions\r\nsaps the vital strength of religion itself is indeed a problem for the\r\nwhole community. The fear suggests itself that the spiritual achievement\r\nmay become hampered, that in the competition of the church with the\r\nother agencies of social life the particular church task may be pushed\r\nto the background, and that thus the church in imitating that which\r\nothers can do just as well or better loses the power to do that which\r\nthe church alone can do. The final outcome is therefore practically in\r\nevery way the same. From whatever starting point we may come, we are led\r\nto the conviction that the physician alone is called to administer\r\npsychotherapeutic work, but that he needs a thorough psychological\r\ntraining besides his medical one.\r\n\r\nBut the interest of the community is not only a negative one. Society\r\ndoes not only ask where psychical treatment can be dangerous, but asks\r\nwith not less right whether the scheme and the method might not be\r\nfructified for other social ends besides the mere healing of the sick.\r\nIf psychotherapy demonstrates that for instance hypnotism makes possible\r\nthe reshaping of a pathological mind, it is a natural thought to use the\r\nsame power for remodeling perhaps the lazy or the intemperate, the\r\ncareless or the inattentive, the dishonest or the criminal mind. Both\r\neducators and criminologists have indeed often raised such questions,\r\nand social reformers have not seldom seen there wide perspectives for\r\nsocial movements in future times.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the possibility of such remodeling activity\r\nis given, but as far as education is concerned certainly grave\r\nmisgivings ought to be felt. When we spoke of the treatment of the sick,\r\nwe had always to emphasize that the suggestion cures symptoms but not\r\ndiseases. In the same way hypnotic suggestion might reënforce a single\r\ntrait but would not reform the personality of the child. Yes, the\r\nartificial reënforcement of such special features would deprive\r\neducation of that which is the most essential, namely, the development\r\nof the power to overcome difficulties by own energy. Wherever a\r\nreasonable amount of own will force and attention can be expected to\r\novercome the antagonistic influence, there artificial hypnotic\r\ninfluence ought to be avoided. Everything ought to be left in that case\r\nto suggestions within normal limits, in the form of good example and\r\npersuasions, authority and discipline, love and sympathy. That holds\r\ntrue even for very slight abnormalities which seem still within the\r\nlimits where the own energies can bring about the cure. For instance, I\r\nhave steadily refused requests of students and others to use hypnotism\r\nfor the purpose of overcoming merely bad habits, such as the habit of\r\nbiting the nails. A child who finds some difficulty in sticking\r\nseriously to his tasks might learn now this and now that under the\r\ninfluence of hypnotic suggestions but he would remain entirely untrained\r\nfor mastering the next lesson. In the same way some naughty traits might\r\nbe artificially removed but the child would not gain anything towards\r\nthe much more important power of suppressing an ugly tendency by his own\r\neffort. All that finds its limits where the inhibitions or obstacles in\r\nthe brain of the child are too strong possibly to be overcome by the own\r\ngood will, but in that case we already stand in the field of abnormal\r\nmental life and then of course psychotherapy has its right. The\r\nfeeble-minded and the retarded child, the perverse child and the\r\nemotionally unstable child, belong under the care of the physician, and\r\nin such a case he ought not to hesitate to use the whole supply of\r\npsychotherapeutic methods which are at his disposal.\r\n\r\nStill more complex is the criminological problem. It sounds like an easy\r\nremedy for the greatest social calamity, if it is proposed simply to\r\nhypnotize the criminal and to supplant his antisocial will by a moral\r\none. And if the absurdity of such a proposal is recognized it seems to\r\nmany justified to demand such an intrusion at least in the case of the\r\nborn criminal, even if the occasional criminal cannot be reached. But\r\nthe conception of the born criminal is also only a label which is\r\nsuperficially used for a great variety of minds. That men are born with\r\na brain which necessarily produces criminal actions is not indicated by\r\nany facts. The varieties which nature really produces are brains which\r\nare more liable than others to produce antisocial actions. We recognized\r\nfrom the start that the abnormal mind never introduces any new elements\r\nbut is characterized only by a change of proportions. There is too much\r\nor too little of a certain mental process and just for that reason there\r\nmust be a steady and continuous transition from the normal to the\r\nentirely abnormal. Here again we have not a special class of brains\r\nwhich are criminal; but we have an endless variety of brains with a\r\ngreater or smaller predisposition for antisocial outbreaks. The\r\nvariations which produce this criminal effect may lie in most different\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nThe brain may be for instance inclined to overstrong impulses, so that\r\nany desire rushes to action before the inhibiting counter-idea gets to\r\nwork. Or, on the other hand, the brain may have unusually weak\r\ncounter-ideas so that even a normal impulse does not find its normal\r\nchecking. The fact that selfish and thus antisocial desires awake in the\r\nmind is not abnormal at all; only if they are not normally inhibited,\r\nthe disturbance sets in. Furthermore the associative apparatus of the\r\nbrain may work especially slowly; it may thus bring it about that the\r\ncounteracting ideas do not arise in time. Or the emotions of a person\r\nmay be unusually strong. Or there may be strong suggestibility, by which\r\na bad example or a strong temptation has especially easy access. Or\r\nthere may be negative suggestibility, by which a moral admonition stirs\r\nup a vivid idea of the opposite. In short, there may be a large number\r\nof factors, sometimes even in combination, each one of which increases\r\nthe chances that the individual may come in danger in the midst of\r\ndeveloped society. Yet no one of those factors involves just the\r\nnecessity of crime. The same kinds of brains might simply show stupidity\r\nor credulity or inconsiderateness or brutality or stubbornness or\r\negotism, and might by each of those factors decrease their chances in\r\nthe community without directly running into conflict with the law. The\r\ncriminal is therefore never born as such. He is only born with a brain\r\nwhich is in some directions inefficient and which thus, under certain\r\nunfavorable conditions, will more easily come to criminal deeds than the\r\nnormal brain.\r\n\r\nWith the idea of a stereotyped born criminal there disappears also the\r\nidea of a uniform treatment against criminal tendencies. That men are\r\ndifferent in their power of resistance or in their power of efficiency\r\nor in their intellect or in their emotions, we have to accept as the\r\nfundamental condition with which every society starts. It would be\r\nabsurd to remodel them artificially after a pattern. The result would be\r\nwithout value anyhow, inasmuch as our appreciation is relative. No\r\ncharacter is perfect. The more the differences were reduced, the more we\r\nshould become sensitive even for the smaller variations. All that\r\nsociety can do is, therefore, not to remodel the manifoldness of brains,\r\nbut to shape the conditions of life in such a way that the weak and\r\nunstable brains also have a greater chance to live their lives without\r\nconflicts with the community.\r\n\r\nThe situation is different as soon as the particular surroundings have\r\nbrought it about that such a brain with reduced powers has entered a\r\ncriminal career. The thought of crime now becomes a sort of obsession or\r\nrather an autosuggestion. The way to this idea has become a path of\r\nleast resistance, and as soon as such an unfortunate situation has\r\nsettled itself, the chances are overwhelming that a criminal career has\r\nbeen started. If such cases should come early to suggestive treatment\r\nwhich really would close the channels of the antisocial autosuggestion,\r\nmuch harm might be averted. Yet again the liability of the brain to\r\nbecome antisocial would not have been removed, and thus not much would\r\nbe secured unless such a person after the treatment could be kept under\r\nfavorable conditions. With young boys who through unfortunate influence\r\nhave caught a tendency, for instance, to steal, and where the fault does\r\nnot yield to sympathetic reasoning and to punishment, an early hypnotic\r\ntreatment might certainly be tried. I myself have seen promising\r\nresults. But if the impulse has irresistible character in such a way\r\nthat the good will is powerless, we are again in the field of disease\r\nand the point of view of the physician has to be substituted for that of\r\nthe criminologist.\r\n\r\nWhether pedagogy and criminology are to make use of the services of\r\npsychotherapy is thus certainly an open question. It would be\r\nshort-sighted to overlook the serious obstacles which stand in the way.\r\nBut while the social life outside of the circle of real disease may\r\nbetter go on without direct interference by psychotherapeutic\r\ninfluences, it is certainly the duty of the community to make the\r\nunderlying principles of psychotherapy useful for the sound development\r\nof society. The artificial over-suggestions which are needed to overcome\r\nthe pathological disturbances of mental equilibrium may be left for the\r\ncases of illness. But we saw that every mental symptom of disease was\r\nonly an exaggeration of abnormal variations which occurred within the\r\nlimit of health. To reduce these abnormalities means to secure a more\r\nstable equilibrium and thus to avoid social damages, and at the same\r\ntime to prevent the growth of the abnormality to pathological\r\ndimensions. To counteract these slighter variations, these abnormalities\r\nwhich have not yet reached the degree of disease, will demand the same\r\nprinciples of treatment, only in a weaker form. It is in a way not\r\npsychical therapy but psychical hygiene. And this is no longer confined\r\nto the physician but must be intrusted to all organs of the community.\r\nAnd here more than in the case of disease, the causal point of view of\r\nthe physician ought to be brought into harmony with the purposive view\r\nof the social reformer, of the educator and of the moralist.\r\n\r\nThe ideal of such mental hygiene is the complete equilibrium of all\r\nmental energies together with their fullest possible development. To\r\nwork towards this end does not mean to aim towards the impossible and\r\nundesirable end of making all men alike, but to give to all, in spite of\r\nthe differences which nature and society condition, the greatest\r\npossible inner completeness and outer usefulness. The efforts in that\r\ndirection have to begin with the earliest infancy and are at no age to\r\nbe considered as finished; the whole school work and to a high degree\r\nthe professional work has to be subordinated to such endeavor. Society\r\nhas further to take care that those spheres of life which stand less\r\nunder systematic principles, such as the home life of the child and the\r\nsocial life of the man, his family life and his public life, are\r\nsteadily under the pressure of influences which urge in the same\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nHarmonious development without one-sidedness, and yet with full justice\r\nto the individual talents and equipments, should be secured. That means\r\nfrom the start an effort to secure balance between general education and\r\nparticular development. The latter has to strengthen those powers by\r\nwhich the boy or girl by special natural fitness promises to be\r\nespecially efficient and happy. It has to be supplemented later by a\r\nwise and deliberate choice of such a vocation as brings these\r\nparticular abilities most strongly to a focus. Yet this alone would mean\r\na one-sidedness in which the equilibrium would be lost. More important,\r\nit would leave undeveloped that power which the youth especially needs\r\nto acquire by serious education, the power to master what does not\r\nappeal to the personal likings and interests. An equilibrium is secured\r\nonly if at the same time full emphasis is given to the learning and\r\ntraining in all which is the common ground of our social existence. From\r\nthe multiplication table to the highest cultural studies in college, the\r\nyouth is to be adjusted to the material of our civilization without any\r\nconcession to the emasculating desire to adjust civilization simply to\r\nthe particular youth. He has to learn learning and not only to play with\r\nknowledge, he has to learn to force his attention in adjustment to those\r\nfactors of civilization which are foreign to his personal tendencies and\r\nperhaps unsympathetic. Free election of life's work and unyielding\r\nmental discipline in the service of the common demands should thus\r\nsteadily coöperate. The one without the other creates a lack of mental\r\nbalance which is the most favorable condition for a pathological\r\ndisturbance.\r\n\r\nThe mere learning is of course on both sides only a fraction of what the\r\ncommunity has to develop in the youth. Mental hygiene begins with\r\nphysiological hygiene. The nourishment of the child, the care for the\r\nchild's sense organs, the recesses and the rest from fatigue, and\r\nespecially the undisturbed sleep are essential conditions. The\r\ninterferences with sufficient sleep are to a high degree responsible\r\nfor the later disturbances of the mental life. It must not be forgotten\r\nthat the decomposition of the brain molecules can never be restituted by\r\nanything but rest, and ultimately by sleep. Physical exercise is\r\ncertainly not such restitution. In the best case it brings a certain\r\nrest to some brain centers by engaging other brain parts. The child\r\nneeds sleep and fresh air and healthful food more than anything else, if\r\nhis mind is active. The careful examination of the sense organs and of\r\nthe unhindered breathing through the nose is most important. Even a\r\nslight defect in hearing may become the cause of an under-development of\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nMore important than mere physical hygiene is the demand that a sound\r\ncharacter and a sound temperament are also to be built up, at the side\r\nof a sound interest. Here again everything depends upon a wise balance\r\nbetween the development of that which is given by nature to the\r\nparticular individual and the reënforcement of that which society\r\ndemands and which belongs therefore to the common equipment. The\r\nemotional stability and emotional enlargement of the mind is perhaps\r\nmost neglected in our educational schemes. On the one side it demands a\r\nsystematic discipline of the emotions, on the other a healthy\r\nstimulation of emotions. Here is the place where imagination in play and\r\nlater in art come in. The biological value of play always lies in the\r\ntraining for the functions of later life, and especially for the\r\nemotional functions. The play of our children is too little adjusted to\r\nthis task. For this reason it leaves too many unprepared for the world\r\nof art and for the emotional experiences of real life. Both lack of\r\nemotional discipline and narrow one-sidedness of emotions interfere with\r\nthe harmonious development. Destructive emotions like terror ought to be\r\nkept away and not needlessly brought near by uncanny stories and mystic\r\nsuperstitions. It is the healthy love and sympathy of the home which\r\ncontributes most strongly to the normal development of emotions. Again\r\nin the field of will, we want the strong, spontaneous, independent will\r\nwhich is not frightened by discomfort and not discouraged by obstacles,\r\nand yet we want the will which is not stubborn and selfish but which\r\nsubordinates itself to the larger will of the social group and to the\r\neternal will of the norm. There is no balance where independence and\r\nsubordination do not supplement each other. A wide education not only\r\ntrains for both but also secures habits which work as autosuggestions in\r\nboth directions.\r\n\r\nBut all this harmonious development of intellect and temperament and\r\ncharacter has to go on when the school days are over and just here\r\nbegins the duty of the community as a whole. The special functions of\r\nthe teachers have to be taken up by the public institutions. The whole\r\nsocial life must shape itself in such a way that everyone finds the best\r\npossible chances to perfect this harmonious growth. In the field of the\r\nintellect, the community must take care that thoroughness of training\r\nand accuracy of information is rigidly demanded and not thrust out by\r\nan easy-going superficiality. The expert ought to replace the amateur in\r\nevery field. Every society which allows successes to superficiality\r\ndiminishes its chances for mental health. Yet while thoroughness demands\r\nconcentration in one direction, society must with the same earnestness\r\ninsist on well-rounded general education and continuity of general\r\ninterests through life. Literature and the libraries, the newspapers and\r\nthe magazines play there a foremost rôle, and again the mental health of\r\nthe community has to pay the penalty if its newspapers work against\r\ngeneral culture. In the emotional field art and music, fiction and the\r\ntheater on the one side, the church on the other side, remain the great\r\nschools for a development of sound emotions. Where literature becomes\r\ntrivial, where the stage becomes degraded, and where the church becomes\r\nutilitarian and uninspiring, great powers for possible good in emotional\r\neducation are lost. But with this enrichment of feelings the\r\ndisciplinary influence too has to go through the whole social life.\r\nWhere art is sensational and the church hysterical,--in short, where the\r\ncommunity stirs up overstrong feelings,--the wholesome balance is lost\r\nagain. In a similar way the public demands should throughout stimulate\r\nthe energy and ambitions and initiative of the man, and yet should keep\r\nhis desires and impulses in control.\r\n\r\nFew factors are more influential in all these directions than the\r\nadministration of law. Sound sober lawmaking and fair judgment in court\r\nsecure to the community a feeling of safety which gives stability to\r\nemotions and feelings. The disorganization which results from arbitrary\r\nlaws, from habitual violation of laws, from corruption and injustice\r\nworks like a poison on the psychophysical system. A similar unbalancing\r\ninfluence emanates from overstrong contrasts of poverty and comfort. A\r\npoverty which discourages and leaves no chances and a wealth which\r\nannihilates the energies and effaces the consciousness of moral\r\nequality, create alike pernicious conditions for mental balance.\r\n\r\nUnlimited furthermore are the influences which depend upon the sexual\r\nideas of the society. It is the sphere in which it may be most difficult\r\nto indicate the way towards a development without dangers. There is no\r\ndoubt the arbitrary suppression of the sexual instinct must be\r\nacknowledged as the source of nervous injury while indulgence may lead\r\nto disease and misery. But in any case frivolous habits and easy divorce\r\ncontribute much to the unbalanced life which ruins the unstable\r\nindividual. Not less difficult and not less connected with the mental\r\nhygiene is the alcohol problem. For normal adult men mild doses have\r\nthrough their power to relieve the inhibitions undeniable value for the\r\nsound development of the community. Its intemperate use or its use by\r\nyoung people and by pathological persons is one of the gravest dangers.\r\nWhether intemperance ought to be fought by prohibition or rather by an\r\neducation to temperance is a difficult question in which the\r\nenthusiastic women and ministers, backed by the well justified fears of\r\npsychiatrists, will hardly be on the same side as the sober judgment of\r\nscientists, unprejudiced physicians, and historians. In any case the\r\nsaloon and its humiliating indecency must disappear and every temptation\r\nto intemperance should be removed. Above all, from early childhood the\r\nself-control has to be strengthened, the child has to learn from the\r\nbeginning to know the limits to the gratification of his desires and to\r\nabstain from reckless over-indulgence. With such a training later on\r\neven the temptations of alcoholic beverages would lose their danger. Not\r\nless injurious than the strong drinks are the cards. All gambling from\r\nthe child's play to the stock exchange is ruinous for the psychophysical\r\nequilibrium. The same is true of any overuse of coffee and tea and\r\ntobacco, and as a matter of course still more the habitual use of the\r\ndrugs like the popular headache powders and sleeping medicines. The life\r\nat home and in public ought to be manifold and expansive but ought to\r\navoid over-excitement and over-anxiety. A good conscience, a congenial\r\nhome, and a serious purpose are after all the safest conditions for a\r\nhealthy mind, and the community works in preventive psychotherapy\r\nwherever it facilitates the securing of these three factors.\r\n\r\nFor that end society may take over directly from the workshop of the\r\npsychotherapist quite a number of almost technical methods. Suggestion\r\nis one of them. The means of suggestion through education and art,\r\nthrough the church and through public opinion, through example and\r\ntradition, and even through fashion and prejudices, are millionfold,\r\nbut not less numerous are the channels for antisocial and antihygienic\r\nsuggestions. No one can measure the injury done to the psychophysical\r\nbalance of the weaker brains, for instance, by the sensational court\r\ngossip and reports of murder trials in the newspapers for the masses.\r\nBut while the influence of suggestion is on the whole familiar to public\r\nopinion, the community is much less aware of another factor which we\r\nfound important in the hands of the psychotherapist. We recognized that\r\nmental disturbances were often the result of suppressed emotion and\r\nrepressed wishes. For the cure the psychotherapist has to aim toward the\r\ncathartic result. The suppressed ideas had to be brought to\r\nconsciousness again and then to be discharged through vivid expression.\r\nSociety ought to learn from it that few factors are more disturbing for\r\nthe mental balance than feelings and emotions which do not come to a\r\nnormal expression. It is no chance that in countries of mixed Protestant\r\nand Catholic civilization, the number of suicides is larger in\r\nProtestant regions than in the Catholic ones where the confessional\r\nrelieves the suppressed emotions of the masses. This is also the most\r\ndestructive effect of social and legal injustice; emotions are\r\nstrangulated and then begin to work mischief. The community should take\r\ncare early that secret feelings are avoided, that the child is cured\r\nfrom all sullenness which stores up the emotion instead of discharging\r\nit. Certainly all education and social life demands inhibition and also\r\nthe child has to learn not to give expression to every passing feeling.\r\nTo find there the sound middle way is again the real hygienic ideal. Too\r\nmuch in our social life and especially in the sphere of sexuality forces\r\non the individual a hypocrisy and secrecy which is among the most\r\npowerful conditions of later mental instability.\r\n\r\nOf course the background of a hygienic life of the community remains the\r\nphilosophy of life which gives unity to the scattered energies and\r\nconsequently steadiness to the individual through all his hazards of\r\nfate. It might seem doubtful whether society could get the prescription\r\nfor such a steady view of the world also from the workshop of the\r\npsychotherapist. To the superficial observer the opposite might seem\r\nevident, as every word of our psychotherapeutic study indicated that\r\nthat is a view of life which makes man's inner experience simply an\r\neffect of foregoing causes. All life becomes a psychophysical mechanism\r\nand from that point of view man's thinking and acting become the\r\nnecessary outcome of the foregoing conditions. Nothing seems more unfit\r\nto give a deeper meaning to life and a higher value. And yet if there\r\nwas one thought which controlled our discussion from the beginning, it\r\nwas certainly the conviction that this causal view itself is only an\r\ninstrument in the service of idealistic endeavors; the reality of man's\r\nlife is the reality of will and freedom directed towards ideals. One of\r\nthese ideals is the reconstruction of the world in the thought forms of\r\ncausality. In the service of our ideals we may thus transform the world\r\ninto a mechanism: out of our freedom we desire to conceive ourselves as\r\nnecessary products. Whenever we aim to produce changes in the world, we\r\nmust calculate the effects through the means of this causal\r\nconstruction, but we never have a right to forget that this calculation\r\nitself is therefore only a tool and that our reality, in which our\r\nduties and our real aims lie, is itself outside of this construction.\r\nThe psychotherapist wants to produce effects inasmuch as he wants to\r\ncure disease. He is therefore obliged to adjust his work as such\r\nentirely to the causal aspect of man, as soon as he wants to seek the\r\nmeans by which he can reach the end. But even the fact that he decides\r\nin favor of those ends, that he aims towards their realization, binds\r\nhim to a world of purposes, and therefore, he, too, with his whole\r\npsychophysical work, stands with both feet in a reality of will which is\r\ncontrolled not by causes but by purposes, not by natural laws but by\r\nideals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAbnormal,
