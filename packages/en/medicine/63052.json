KNOX GELATINE CO., INC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   Questions and answers regarding the NEW KNOX CHOICE-OF-FOODS diet:\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {uncaptioned}]\r\n\r\nQ. IS THIS NEW DIET BASED ON SOUND REDUCING PRINCIPLES YOUR DOCTOR WILL\r\nOK?\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {uncaptioned}]\r\n\r\nA. _Indeed he will_ ... because the CHOICE-OF-FOODS DIET is based on\r\nsound nutritional principles with which your doctor has had a great deal\r\nof experience. For many years the medical profession has advised the use\r\nof Food Exchange Lists[1] where proper diet is of the utmost importance\r\nto the patient’s very existence ... as in the case of the diabetic.\r\nNaturally, this system of dieting must provide with unfailing accuracy,\r\nthe proper amounts of protein, minerals and vitamins essential to good\r\nhealth at all times.\r\n\r\nNow, these carefully and scientifically developed Food Exchanges (or, as\r\nwe call them ... CHOICES) have been adjusted to a reducing diet, making\r\nit one that can actually improve your health as well as control your\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nQ. IF YOU HAVE TRIED OTHER WAYS OF REDUCING WITHOUT SUCCESS ... WHY WILL\r\nTHE CHOICE-OF-FOODS DIET SOLVE YOUR WEIGHT PROBLEM?\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {uncaptioned}]\r\n\r\nA. _Weight control normally involves just 2 factors_:\r\n\r\nthe knowledge of a few simple rules of nutrition and your own will power\r\nto carry them out. First of all, there’s no mystery about why you’ve put\r\non weight. You’ve been eating more food than your body burns up ... so,\r\nthis extra food has turned to fat. You _will_ lose extra weight on this\r\nsafe, sound diet ... because you’ll be eating fewer calories[2] than\r\nneeded and will force your body to use the stored fat. You’ll find the\r\nCHOICE-OF-FOODS DIET is _more_ than a way to get rid of excess weight\r\nright now. It is a basic guide to good eating habits for anyone ... fat\r\nor thin. It will teach you _what foods_ and how much of them to eat to\r\nget slim and _stay_ slim.\r\n\r\nQ. IS THIS A MONOTONOUS “SAME FOODS EVERY DAY” DIET ... OR IS IT A\r\nVARIED ONE YOU’LL FIND EASY TO STICK TO?\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {uncaptioned}]\r\n\r\nA. _The Knox Choice-of-Foods diet offers you a wide variety of good_,\r\nnormal _foods_ ... not extreme or faddish ones, from which to prepare\r\nmeals you and your family will enjoy. In fact, the only way your family\r\nwill know you’re dieting will be when they see you take smaller\r\nportions. A diet that allows you to eat such favorites as steak, baked\r\npotatoes, seafood and delicious desserts is one you’ll find easy to\r\nfollow ... even long after you’ve reached your weight goal.\r\n\r\nQ. DO YOU HAVE TO SPEND TIME COUNTING CALORIES AND WORRYING ABOUT\r\nBALANCED MEALS?\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {uncaptioned}]\r\n\r\nA. _No, and this is one good reason why you’ll find it so easy to stay\r\non the Knox Choice-of-Foods diet._\r\n\r\nIt does most of the work for you! As you look at the key to this\r\nreducing plan—the CHOICE-OF-FOODS DIET LISTS (shown on pull-out chart\r\nfollowing page 18) you will quickly see that the foods you must eat\r\nclassify into 6 simple lists. _The foods in amounts indicated in each of\r\nthese lists are nutritional equals._\r\n\r\nFOR EXAMPLE:\r\n\r\nUnder the Meat List you will find seven foods ... each one having the\r\n_same amount of protein, carbohydrate, fat and calories_—\r\n\r\n  Meat and poultry (Beef, lamb, pork, liver, chicken)\r\n  Cold Cuts (Salami, minced ham, Bologna, liverwurst, luncheon loaf)\r\n  Frankfurter\r\n  Egg\r\n  Fish (Haddock, flounder, bass, salmon, tuna, crab, lobster, shrimp,\r\n              clams, oysters, sardines)\r\n  Cheese (Cheddar type, cottage)\r\n  Peanut butter\r\n\r\nIf yours is the 1200 daily calorie diet ... and calls for 4 of the foods\r\non the Meat List ... just select _any_ 4 of the foods you wish (in the\r\nquantity indicated) without thinking about calories and you can’t go\r\nwrong. _The calories have already been counted for you when the list was\r\nprepared._\r\n\r\nQ. WHY DOES PROTEIN PLAY SUCH AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THIS DIET?\r\n\r\nA. _Because this particular nutrient is a vital key to feeling, looking\r\nand doing your best at all times._ The more science proves about\r\nprotein, the more we know of its importance in the daily diet. _Your\r\nbody can’t store protein ... you must have a new supply of it every day\r\nto build and renew body tissues._ You can readily see, then, why protein\r\nis so necessary in reducing diets. Without it, body tissues waste away,\r\nmuscles sag and pep lags.\r\n\r\nQ. HOW SOON WILL YOU SEE RESULTS ON THIS REDUCING DIET?\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {uncaptioned}]\r\n\r\nA. _You will lose from one to three pounds[3] a week._ However, don’t be\r\ndiscouraged if you lose slowly at first or if you lose at an irregular\r\nrate. Remember, you gained all these extra pounds over a period of time.\r\nGive yourself time to lose them.\r\n\r\nQ. IF YOU GET HUNGRY ... ARE “BETWEEN-MEAL” SNACKS ALLOWED ON THIS DIET?\r\n\r\nA. _Yes! Because they not only make dieting more pleasant, they are\r\nnecessary!_ Nutritionally, a “between-meal” snack does two things: gives\r\ndieters an “energy lift” needed at late morning and late afternoon.\r\nAlso, it dulls the appetite, making the dieter content with less food at\r\nthe next meal. Remember, however, these snacks must be kept within your\r\ndaily calorie pattern!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Choice-of-Foods diet allows you to have the famous Knox High-Protein\r\n                     Gelatine Drink 3 times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {uncaptioned}]\r\n\r\n(Yes, this is the same concentrated protein drink doctors have\r\nrecommended for years ... as a pleasant way to get more protein in the\r\ndaily diet of persons whose daily intake of this vital nutrient may be\r\ninadequate.) In the reducing diet, the Knox Drink works 3 ways:\r\n\r\n  1. It’s a wonderfully refreshing and filling “between-meal” treat\r\n  2. It curbs your appetite, so you are satisfied with less food\r\n  3. It supplies you with _additional protein, a must_ when you are\r\n          taking off excess weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          Take the Knox High-Protein Drink ½ hour before meals\r\n               ... _IN EITHER OF THESE APPETIZING WAYS:_\r\n\r\n\r\nAS A COLD DRINK (WITH FRUIT JUICES)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {uncaptioned}]\r\n\r\nEmpty 1 envelope Knox Gelatine in ¾ glass of orange juice, other fruit\r\njuices or water, not iced. Let liquid absorb the gelatine. Then stir\r\nbriskly. Drink quickly. If it thickens, add more liquid, stir again.\r\n\r\nAS A HOT DRINK (WITH BOUILLON)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {uncaptioned}]\r\n\r\nSprinkle 1 envelope Knox Gelatine on ¼ cup cold water to soften. Add 1\r\nbouillon cube and ¾ cup boiling water. Stir until gelatine and bouillon\r\ncube are thoroughly dissolved. ¾ cup of any very hot broth may be used\r\nin place of bouillon.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, you’ll find you have a wide choice of delicious, filling Knox\r\nsoups, salads and desserts that have so few calories ... _you may have a\r\nserving of any one of them a day and not worry about upsetting your\r\ndaily calorie pattern_. Look for these delicious treats in the recipe\r\nsection in back of book.\r\n\r\nQ. AFTER YOUR WEIGHT GOAL IS REACHED, HOW WILL YOU KEEP YOUR SLENDER,\r\nNEW FIGURE?\r\n\r\nA. _The sensible eating habits you form while following the Knox\r\nChoice-of-Foods diet and the Knox “Booster” Drink will help you do\r\nthis!_ You will find you’ve lost much of your desire for over-eating.\r\nYou’ve seen the dramatic change in your looks and your feelings. You’re\r\nmore attractive, feel younger, healthier, happier. Now you want to stay\r\nthat way!\r\n\r\nWith the loss of excess weight, you are now entitled to more calories.\r\n However, always remember, _too many more calories_ will put extra\r\npounds right back on.\r\n\r\nActually, _you can have about ½ as many more calories as your original\r\ndiet plan called for_. For instance, if you were on the 1200 calorie\r\nKnox diet, about 1800 calories is right for you to maintain your new\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nAs you have already learned on page 8, Protein is the vital key to\r\nfeeling and looking your best at all times ... particularly when you are\r\nreducing or _watching your weight_ as you are now doing. The Knox\r\nHigh-Protein “Booster” Drink[4] made with milk will not only add about\r\n15 grams of useful, body-building Protein to your daily diet, but will\r\nalso serve as a healthful curb to your appetite.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {uncaptioned}]\r\n\r\nTake the Knox “Booster” Drink (with milk) ½ hour before lunch and\r\ndinner. In an 8 or 10 oz. dry glass, thoroughly mix 1 envelope Knox\r\nGelatine with 3-6 tablespoons _instant_ non-fat dry milk. (Varies with\r\nbrand.) Fill with cold water. Stir briskly until milk thoroughly\r\ndissolves. Drink quickly.\r\n\r\nQ. HOW DO YOU GET STARTED ON THE KNOX CHOICE-OF-FOODS DIET?\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {uncaptioned}]\r\n\r\nA. FIRST, _find your desirable weight on the following chart_; SECOND,\r\n_determine the proper number of calories you need to lose weight_.\r\nHERE’S HOW: Let’s say you are a woman 5′3″ tall and have a medium frame;\r\naccording to the table you should weigh 128 lbs. Now multiplying this by\r\n10 you will have the recommended daily calories you should have to lose\r\nweight properly.\r\n\r\n                        128 × 10 = 1280 calories\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:

ALSO NOTE THESE SPECIAL MENU HELPS\r\n\r\n\r\n1. When a recipe serving is listed as “Free Choice” it means that you\r\nmay eat 1 serving without having to count it in your daily diet pattern.\r\n\r\n2. Use the milk in your meal plan to drink, in coffee, on cereal, or\r\nwith other foods.\r\n\r\n3. Serve vegetables plain or with part of the meat or fat choice for\r\nseasoning. You may wish to use together the vegetables, milk, and meat\r\nchoices in your meal plan. This way you can make soups, stews, or other\r\ndishes in which you combine several foods.\r\n\r\n4. Measure all foods on the Bread List after they have been cooked.\r\n\r\n5. Eat the meat or fish prepared for the family as long as no fat or\r\nflour has been added. Meat juices, with the fat removed, may be used\r\nwith your meat or vegetables for added flavor.\r\n\r\nIt is important that you measure meat after it is cooked. Bones and\r\nextra fat should not be counted in the total weight. Cut off extra fat\r\ninstead of eating it.\r\n\r\n6. When you are on a reducing regime, no matter whether on a 1200, 1600,\r\nor 1800 calorie diet, use only the amount of fat permitted in that diet.\r\nYou may use it in any way you prefer—as a spread, for seasoning foods,\r\nin dressing vegetables—but count the fat used in these ways as part of\r\nyour total allowance for the day.\r\n\r\nIt is easier to diet when food looks so appealing that you don’t miss\r\nhigh-calorie foods or high-calorie extras.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SPECIAL RECIPE HELPS\r\n\r\n\r\n_It may help you to have a list of some foods that are low in calories._\r\n\r\n\r\n                         LOW-CALORIE SWEETENERS\r\n\r\nBecause each teaspoon of sugar gives 20 calories, you can cut them down\r\nif you use a sweetener that will not supply any calories.\r\n\r\nLow-calorie sweeteners mean sweet taste without calories and without\r\nsugar. The recipes in this booklet use saccharin (¼ grain tablets),\r\nSucaryl (tablets or solution), and Sweeta (solution).\r\n\r\n  1 tablet saccharin              Equaled in sweetness by 1 teaspoon\r\n                                  of sugar\r\n                or\r\n  1 tablet Sucaryl\r\n                or\r\n  ⅛ tsp. Sucaryl solution\r\n                or\r\n  2 drops Sweeta\r\n\r\nIt is unwise to take more than a reasonable amount (equal to about 12\r\ntablets) as the total in the day’s meals.\r\n\r\nLiquid non-caloric sweeteners may be added directly to the dissolved\r\ngelatine mixture.\r\n\r\nNon-caloric sweetening tablets may be crushed and stirred into the\r\ndissolved gelatine mixture, or they may be dissolved in small amount of\r\nthe liquid called for in a recipe, then added.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           LOW-CALORIE FOODS\r\n\r\nA number of low-calorie canned or bottle fruits, fruit juices, and\r\nbeverages are now available in many markets. These foods add much\r\ninterest in low-calorie diets.\r\n\r\nLow-calorie foods used in recipes in this booklet include:\r\n\r\n  Canned Fruits, unsweetened\r\n  Canned Fruits, non-caloric sweetened\r\n  Canned Fruit Juices, unsweetened\r\n  Canned Fruit Juices, non-caloric sweetened\r\n  Carbonated Beverages, non-caloric sweetened\r\n\r\nSkim milk is a low-caloric form of milk which helps with successful\r\nweight loss by keeping calories low while food value remains high. Fluid\r\nskim milk or non-fat dry milk solids can be used.\r\n\r\nNon-fat dry milk solids plus water make skim milk. Follow directions on\r\nthe package for correct proportions. To reliquefy—measure dry milk into\r\nglass; add 1 cup water and stir. Chill.\r\n\r\n\r\n              STEPS TO SUCCESS WITH KNOX GELATINE RECIPES\r\n\r\nTo insure satisfactory jelling, the number of grains of Knox Unflavored\r\nGelatine in each envelope is measured scientifically. Tablespoons vary\r\nin size. An “envelope” of gelatine is always an accurate measure.\r\n\r\nTo soften gelatine in all cold liquids except milk, sprinkle gelatine\r\ninto ½ cup of the cold liquid. Let stand to soften.\r\n\r\nTo soften gelatine in ½ cup of cold milk, stir the gelatine into the\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nTo dissolve softened gelatine, stir into hot liquid required in the\r\nrecipe, or place over hot water and stir until dissolved.\r\n\r\nOne envelope of gelatine will gel up to 2 cups of liquid.\r\n\r\nWhen solids are added to 2 cups of a gelatine-liquid mixture, up to 2\r\ncups may be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MORE GEL-COOKERY HELPS\r\n\r\nFresh pineapple and frozen must be cooked before adding it to a gelatine\r\nmixture to insure jelling; canned pineapple can be used as it comes from\r\nthe can.\r\n\r\nWhen adding solid ingredients, the gelatine mixture is first chilled to\r\nthe consistency of cold unbeaten egg white from fresh eggs. This\r\nprevents the solids from rising to the top or sinking to the bottom of\r\nthe mold.\r\n\r\nTo chill the gelatine mixture quickly to the consistency of unbeaten egg\r\nwhite, half fill the lower part of a double boiler with ice and water.\r\nSet upper part of double boiler containing the gelatine-liquid mixture\r\nover the ice. Stir frequently until it is a smooth, evenly chilled,\r\nunbeaten egg white consistency. As an alternative, two bowls may be used\r\ninstead of the double boiler.\r\n\r\nWhen low-calorie sweeteners are used in the recipe, beat the egg whites\r\nstiff but not dry, then fold them in as directed.\r\n\r\nIf sugar is used in the recipe when beaten egg whites are added to the\r\ngelatine, beat a part of it into the egg whites as in meringues.\r\n\r\n\r\n              HOW TO MOLD AND UNMOLD KNOX GELATINE DISHES\r\n\r\nJellied foods—soups, main dishes, salads, or desserts—can be molded in\r\nsquare, round, or loaf pans, muffin tins, washed tins from canned foods,\r\nbowls, cups, glasses, or paper drinking cups. For easy serving, a\r\ngelatine mixture may be chilled in serving dishes that will go directly\r\nto the table, or it may be spooned from bowls into serving dishes.\r\n\r\nTo unmold, dip the mold in warm or hot water to the depth of the\r\ngelatine—metal molds in warm water, glass molds in hot water. Loosen\r\nedge with the tip of a paring knife. Place the serving dish on top of\r\nthe mold, the two tightly together, and turn upside down. Shake, holding\r\nthe serving dish tightly to the mold. Carefully lift off the mold.\r\nGelatine may be unmolded at serving time, or even as long as an hour or\r\nso before mealtime if the service plate or platter is put back in the\r\nrefrigerator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                _Here’s the_ KEY _to the Reducing Plan_\r\n                THE KNOX CHOICE-OF-FOODS DIET LIST CHART\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {uncaptioned}]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          KNOX Gel-Cookery is GOOD EATING that’s good for you!\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {uncaptioned}]\r\n\r\n_On the following pages you’ll see tested low-calorie recipes that make\r\nreducing (AND WEIGHT-WATCHING AFTER REDUCING) a pleasure!_\r\n\r\n\r\nJELLIED TOMATO BROTH\r\n_6 Servings_\r\n_1 Serving Equals Free Choice_\r\n\r\n  1 envelope Knox Unflavored Gelatine\r\n  1½ cups cold water\r\n  1½ cups tomato juice\r\n  ½ teaspoon salt\r\n  2 teaspoons whole mixed spices\r\n\r\nSprinkle gelatine on ½ cup cold water to soften.
