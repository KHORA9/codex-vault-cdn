middle\r\nof the fourteenth century, I desire to record my grateful thanks\r\nto those who have in any way assisted me in gathering together my\r\nmaterial, or in weaving it into a connected narrative. Amongst these\r\nmany kind friends I may specially name Mr. F. Bickley, of the British\r\nMuseum, Mr. F.J. Baigent, the Rev. Prebendary Hingeston-Randolph,\r\nand, above all, Mr. Edmund Bishop, to whom I am greatly indebted\r\nfor advice, criticism, and ever-patient assistance in revising the\r\nproof-sheets.\r\n\r\n[p-xiii]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story of the Great Pestilence of 1348-9 has never been fully\r\ntold. In fact, until comparatively recent times, little attention was\r\npaid to an event which, nevertheless, whether viewed in the magnitude\r\nof the catastrophe, or in regard to its far-reaching results, is\r\ncertainly one of the most important in the history of our country.\r\n\r\nJudged by the ordinary manuals, the middle of the fourteenth century\r\nappears as the time of England's greatest glory. Edward III. was\r\nat the very height of his renown. The crushing defeat of France at\r\nCrecy, in 1346, followed the next year by the taking of Calais, had\r\nraised him to the height of his fame. When, wearing the laurels of\r\nthe most brilliant victory of the age, he landed at Sandwich, on\r\nOctober 14th, 1347, the country, or at least the English courtiers,\r\nseemed intoxicated by the success of his arms. \"A new sun,\" says the\r\nchronicler Walsingham, \"seemed to have arisen over the people, in\r\nthe perfect peace, in the plenty of all things, and in the glory of\r\nsuch victories. [p-xiv] There was hardly a woman of any name who did\r\nnot possess spoils of Caen, Calais and other French towns across the\r\nsea;\" and the English matrons proudly decked themselves with the rich\r\ndresses and costly ornaments carried off from foreign households.\r\nThis was, moreover, the golden era of chivalry, and here and there\r\nthroughout the country tournaments celebrated with exceptional pomp\r\nthe establishment of the Order of the Garter, instituted by King\r\nEdward to perpetuate the memory of his martial successes. It is\r\nlittle wonder, then, that the Great Pestilence, now known as the\r\n\"Black Death,\" coming as it does between Crecy and Poitiers, and at\r\nthe very time of the creation of the first Knights of the Garter,\r\nshould seem to fall aside from the general narrative as though\r\nsomething apart from, and not consonant with, the natural course of\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nIt is accordingly no matter for wonder that a classic like Hume,\r\nin common with our older writers on English history, should have\r\ndismissed the calamity in a few lines; but a reader may well feel\r\nsurprise at finding that the late Mr. J. R. Green, who saw deeper\r\ninto causes and effects than his predecessors, deals with the great\r\nepidemic in a scanty notice only as a mere episode in his account\r\nof the agricultural changes in the fourteenth century. Although he\r\nspeaks generally of the death of one-half the population through the\r\ndisease, he evidently has not realised the enormous effects, social\r\nand religious, which are directly traceable to the catastrophe.\r\n\r\nExcellent articles, indeed, such as those from the pen of [p-xv]\r\nProfessor Seebohm and Dr. Jessop, and chance pages in books on\r\npolitical and social economy, like those of the late Professor\r\nThorold Rogers and Dr. Cunningham, have done much in our time to draw\r\nattention to the importance of the subject. Still, so far as I am\r\naware, no writer has yet treated the plague as a whole, or, indeed,\r\nhas utilised the material available for forming a fairly accurate\r\nestimate of its ravages. The collections for the present study had\r\nbeen entirely made when a book on the _Epidemics in Britain_, by Dr.\r\nCreighton, was announced, and, as a consequence, the work was set\r\naside. On the appearance of Dr. Creighton's volume, however, it was\r\nfound that, whilst treating this pestilence at considerable length\r\nas a portion of his general subject, not merely had it not entered\r\ninto his design to utilise the great bulk of material to be found in\r\nthe various records of the period, but the author had dealt with the\r\nmatter from a wholly different point of view.\r\n\r\nIt is proper, therefore, to state why a detailed treatment of a\r\nsubject, in itself so uninviting, is here undertaken. The pestilence\r\nof 1348-49, for its own sake, must necessarily be treated by the\r\nprofessional writer as an item in the general series of epidemics;\r\nbut there are many reasons why it has never been dealt with in\r\ndetail from the mere point of view of the historian. Yet an adequate\r\nrealisation of its effects is of the first importance for the right\r\nunderstanding of the history of England in the later [p-xvi]\r\nMiddle Ages. The \"Black Death\" inflicted what can only be called\r\na wound deep in the social body, and produced nothing less than a\r\nrevolution of feeling and practice, especially of religious feeling\r\nand practice. Unless this is understood, from the very circumstances\r\nof the case, we shall go astray in our interpretation of the later\r\nhistory of England. In truth, this great pestilence was a turning\r\npoint in the national life. It formed the real close of the Mediæval\r\nperiod and the beginning of our Modern age. It produced a break with\r\nthe past, and was the dawn of a new era. The sudden sweeping away of\r\nthe population and the consequent scarcity of labourers, raised, it\r\nis well recognised, new and extravagant expectations in the minds of\r\nthe lower classes; or, to use a modern expression, labour began then\r\nto understand its value and assert its power.\r\n\r\nBut there is another and yet more important result of the pestilence\r\nwhich, it would seem, is not sufficiently recognised. To most people,\r\nlooking back into the past, the history of the Church during the\r\nMiddle Ages in England appears one continuous and stately progress.\r\nIt is much nearer to the truth to say that in 1351 the whole\r\necclesiastical system was wholly disorganised, or, indeed, more than\r\nhalf ruined, and that everything had to be built up anew. As regards\r\neducation, the effect of the catastrophe on the body of the clergy\r\nwas prejudicial beyond the power of calculation. To secure the most\r\nnecessary public ministrations of the rites of religion the most\r\ninadequately-prepared subjects had to be accepted, and even [p-xvii]\r\nthese could be obtained only in insufficient numbers. The immediate\r\neffect on the people was a religious paralysis. Instead of turning\r\nmen to God the scourge turned them to despair, and this not only in\r\nEngland, but in all parts of Europe. Writers of every nation describe\r\nthe same dissoluteness of manners consequent upon the epidemic. In\r\ntime the religious sense and feeling revived, but in many respects\r\nit took a new tone, and its manifestations ran in new channels.\r\nIf the change is to be described in brief, I should say that the\r\nreligion of Englishmen, as it now manifested itself on the recovery\r\nof religion, and as it existed from that time to the Reformation,\r\nwas characterised by a devotional and more self-reflective cast\r\nthan previously. This is evidenced in particular by the rise of a\r\nwhole school of spiritual writers, the beginnings of which had been\r\nalready manifested in the writings of Hampole, himself a victim\r\nof the plague. It was subsequently developed by such writers as\r\nWalter Hilton and the authors of a mass of anonymous tracts, still\r\nin manuscript, which, in so far as they have attracted notice at\r\nall, have been commonly set down under the general designation of\r\n_Wycliffite_. The reason for this misleading classification is not\r\ndifficult to understand. Finding on the one hand that these tracts\r\nare pervaded by a deeply religious spirit, and on the other being\r\nconvinced that the religion of those days was little better than a\r\nmere formalism, the few persons who have hitherto paid attention to\r\nthe subject have not hesitated to attribute them to the [p-xviii]\r\n\"religious revival of the Lollards,\" and were naturally unable to\r\nbelieve them to be inspired by the teaching of \"a Church shrivelled\r\ninto a self-seeking secular priesthood.\"[1] The reader, who has a\r\npractical and personal experience of the tone, spirit, and teaching\r\nof works of Catholic piety, will, however, at once recognise that\r\nthese tracts are perfect Catholic in tone, spirit, and doctrine, and\r\ndiffer essentially from those of men inspired by the teaching of\r\nWycliffe.\r\n\r\nThe new religious spirit found outward expression in the multitude of\r\nguilds which sprang into existence at this time, in the remarkable\r\nand almost, as it may seem to some, extravagant development of\r\ncertain pious practices, in the singular spread of a more personal\r\ndevotion to the Blessed Sacrament, to the Blessed Virgin, to the Five\r\nWounds, to the Holy Name, and other such manifestations of a more\r\ntender or more familiar piety. Even the very adornment and enrichment\r\nof the churches, so distinctive of this period, bears witness to the\r\nchange. At the close of the fourteenth century and during the course\r\nof the fifteenth the supply of ornaments, furniture, plate, statues\r\npainted or in highly decked \"coats,\" with which the churches were\r\nliterally encumbered as time went on, proved a striking contrast\r\nto the comparative simplicity which characterised former days, as\r\nwitnessed by a comparison of inventories. Moreover, the source of all\r\nthis wealth and elaboration is [p-xvix] another indication of the\r\nchange that had come over the country. Benefactions to the Church are\r\nno longer contributed entirely, or at least chiefly, by the great\r\nnobles, but they are now the gifts of the burgher folk and middle\r\nclasses, and this very profusion corresponds, according to the ideas\r\nand feelings of those days, to the abundant material comfort which\r\nfrom the early years of the last century to the present has specially\r\ncharacterised the English homes of modern times. In fact, the\r\nfifteenth century witnessed the beginnings of a great middle-class\r\nmovement, which can be distinctly traced to the effect of the great\r\npestilence, and which, whether for good or for evil, was checked by\r\nthe change of religion in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficient here to have indicated in the most general way the\r\nchange which took place in the religious life of the English people\r\nand the new tendencies which manifested themselves. If the later\r\nreligious history of the country is to be understood it is necessary\r\nto take this catastrophe, social and religious, as a starting-point,\r\nand to bring home to the mind the part the Black Death really played\r\nin the national history.\r\n\r\nMerely to report what is said of England would tend to raise in the\r\nmind of the reader a certain incredulity. A short and rapid review\r\nhas accordingly been made of the progress of the pestilence from\r\nEastern Europe to these Western shores, and by this means the very\r\ndistressing unanimity, even to definite forms of language, of writers\r\n[p-xx] who recorded events hundreds and even thousands of miles\r\napart, brings home the reality of the catastrophe with irresistible\r\nforce. The story, so far as England is concerned, is told at greater\r\nlength, and the progress of the disease is followed as it swept from\r\nsouth to north and passed on to higher latitudes. The state of the\r\ncountry after the pestilence was over is then briefly described, and\r\nattention is called to some of the immediate results of the great\r\nplague, especially as bearing upon the Church life of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Green, _Short History of the English People_, p. 216.\r\n\r\n[p001]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT PESTILENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMENCEMENT OF THE EPIDEMIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Great Pestilence, which first reached Europe in the autumn of\r\n1347, is said to have originated in the East some three or four years\r\npreviously. So far as actual history goes, however, the progress of\r\nthe disease can be traced only from the ports of the Black Sea and\r\npossibly from those of the Mediterranean, to which traders along\r\nthe main roads of commerce with Asiatic countries brought their\r\nmerchandise for conveyance to the Western world. Reports at the\r\ntime spoke of great earthquakes and other physical disturbances as\r\nhaving taken place in the far East, and these were said to have been\r\naccompanied by peculiar conditions of the atmosphere, and followed by\r\na great mortality among the teeming populations of India and China.\r\nPope Clement VI. was informed that the pestilence then raging at\r\nAvignon had had its origin in the East, and that, in the countries\r\nincluded under that vague name, the infection had spread so rapidly,\r\nand had proved to be so deadly, that the victims were calculated\r\nat the enormous, and no doubt exaggerated, number of nearly\r\nfour-and-twenty millions.\r\n\r\nA Prague chronicle speaks of the epidemic in the kingdoms of China,\r\nIndia, and Persia, and the contemporary historian, Matteo Villani,\r\nreports its conveyance to Europe by Italian traders, who had fled\r\nbefore it from the ports on the eastern shores of the Black Sea. The\r\nsame authority [p002] corroborates, by the testimony of one who had\r\nbeen an eye-witness in Asia, the reports of certain Genoese merchants\r\nas to earthquakes devastating the continent and pestilential fogs\r\ncovering the land. \"A venerable friar minor of Florence, now a\r\nbishop, declared,\" so says Villani, \"that he was then in that part of\r\nthe country at the city of Lamech, where by the violence of the shock\r\npart of the temple of Mahomet was thrown down.\"[2]\r\n\r\nA quotation from Hecker's \"Epidemics of the Middle Ages\" will be a\r\nsufficient summary of what was reported of the plague in eastern\r\ncountries before its arrival in Europe. \"Cairo lost daily, when the\r\nplague was raging with its greatest violence, from 10 to 15,000,\r\nbeing as many as, in modern times, great plagues have carried off\r\nduring their whole course. In China more than thirteen millions\r\nare said to have died, and this is in correspondence with the\r\ncertainly exaggerated accounts from the rest of Asia. India was\r\ndepopulated. Tartary, Mesopotamia, Syria, Armenia were covered with\r\ndead bodies; the Kurds fled in vain to the mountains. In Caramania\r\nand Cæsarea none were left alive. On the roads, in the camps, in the\r\ncaravansaries unburied bodies were alone to be seen. . . . In Aleppo\r\n500 died daily; 22,000 people and most of the animals were carried\r\noff in Gaza within six weeks. Cyprus lost almost all its inhabitants;\r\nand ships without crews were often seen in the Mediterranean, as\r\nafterwards in the North Sea, driving about and spreading the plague\r\nwherever they went ashore.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that the contagion was first spread by\r\nmeans of the great trade routes of the East. The lines of commerce of\r\nEuropean countries with India, China, and Asiatic countries generally\r\nare first definitely described in 1321 by Marino Sanudo, a Venetian,\r\nin a work addressed to Pope John XXI., not thirty years before the\r\noutbreak of [p003] the pestilence.[4] His object was to indicate\r\nthe difficulties and dangers which then beset the traffic of the\r\nmercantile world with the East. In so doing he pointed out that the\r\nancient centre of all trade with the far East was Bagdad. To and from\r\nthis great depôt of Oriental merchandise all the caravan routes led;\r\nbut, at the time when Sanudo wrote, the incursion of barbarian hordes\r\ninto Central Asia had rendered trade along these roads difficult and\r\nunsafe. Two trading tracts are in particular named by the author\r\nas the chief lines of communication. One ran from Bagdad over the\r\nplains of Mesopotamia and Syria to Lycia,[5] where the goods were\r\npurchased by the Italian merchants. This, the best known route,\r\nwas the shortest by which the produce of China and India could be\r\nconveyed to the European markets; but in the fourteenth century it\r\nwas the most perilous. The second route also started from Bagdad,\r\nand having followed the Tigris to its sources in Armenia, passed on\r\neither to Trebizond and other ports of the Black Sea, or taking the\r\nroad from the Caspian, upon the other side of the Caucasus, passed to\r\nthe Genoese and other flourishing Italian settlements in the Crimea.\r\n\r\nA third route was, however, according to Sanudo, the most used in his\r\nday because the least dangerous. By it the produce of eastern lands\r\nwas brought to Alexandria, whence, after having been heavily taxed\r\nby the Sultan, it was transported to Europe. Merchandise coming to\r\nItaly and other countries by this route from India was, according to\r\nthe same authority, shipped from two ports of the peninsula, which he\r\ncalls Mahabar[6] and Cambeth.[7] Thence it was conveyed to ports in\r\nthe Persian Gulf, to the river Tigris, or to Aden, at the entrance\r\nof the Red Sea. From this last point a journey of nine days across\r\nthe desert [p004] brought the caravans to a city called Chus[8] on\r\nthe Nile. Fifteen days more of river carriage, however, was required\r\nbefore the produce of the Eastern marts reached Cairo, or Babylon,\r\nas it was called by mediæval writers. From Cairo it was conveyed to\r\nAlexandria by canal.\r\n\r\nThese were the three chief routes by which communication between\r\nAsiatic countries and Europe was kept up, and the markets of the\r\nWestern world supplied with the spices, gums, and silks of the East.\r\nIt is more than probable that the great pestilence was conveyed to\r\nEurope by the trading caravans coming from the East by all these\r\nroads and by other similar lines of commerce. In the country along\r\none of the trade routes, by which caravans reached the Italian\r\nports established on the Crimea, it is certain that the plague was\r\nraging with great virulence in 1346, the year before its appearance\r\nin Europe. Moreover, Gabriele de' Mussi, a notary of Piacenza, and\r\nan eye-witness of the first outbreak of the plague in Upper Italy,\r\nhas described the way in which the infection was conveyed in the\r\nships of traders from Caffa,[9] a Genoese settlement in the Crimea.\r\nThis account will be found in the next chapter; and here it is only\r\nnecessary to report what he gathered from the survivors about the\r\noutbreak of the plague among the Tartar tribes and its appearance at\r\nCaffa.[10] [p005]\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1346,\" he writes, \"in eastern parts an immense\r\nnumber of Tartars and Saracens fell victims to a mysterious and\r\nsudden death. In these regions vast districts, numerous provinces,\r\nmagnificent kingdoms, cities, castles, and villages, peopled by a\r\ngreat multitude, were suddenly attacked by the mortality, and in\r\na brief space were depopulated. A place in the East called Tana,\r\nsituated in a northerly direction from Constantinople and under\r\nthe rule of the Tartars, to which Italian merchants much resorted,\r\nwas besieged by a vast horde of Tartars and was in a short time\r\ntaken.\"[11] The Christian merchants violently expelled from the city\r\nwere then received for the protection of their persons and property\r\nwithin the walls of Caffa, which the Genoese had built in that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\"The Tartars followed these fugitive Italian merchants, and,\r\nsurrounding the city of Caffa, besieged it likewise.[12] Completely\r\nencircled by this vast army of enemies, the inhabitants were hardly\r\nable to obtain the necessaries of life, and their only hope lay in\r\nthe fleet which brought them provisions. Suddenly 'the death,' as it\r\nwas called, broke out in the Tartar host, and thousands were daily\r\ncarried off by the disease, as if \"arrows from heaven were striking\r\nat them and beating down their pride.\"\r\n\r\n\"At first the Tartars were paralysed with fear at the ravages of\r\nthe disease, and at the prospect that sooner or later all must fall\r\nvictims to it. Then they turned their vengeance on the besieged,\r\nand in the hope of communicating the infection to their Christian\r\nenemies, by the aid of the engines of war, they projected the bodies\r\nof the [p006] dead over the walls into the city. The Christian\r\ndefenders, however, held their ground, and committed as many of these\r\nplague-infected bodies as possible to the waters of the sea.\r\n\r\n\"Soon, as might be supposed, the air became tainted and the wells of\r\nwater poisoned, and in this way the disease spread so rapidly in the\r\ncity that few of the inhabitants had strength sufficient to fly from\r\nit.\"[13]\r\n\r\nThe further account of Gabriele de' Mussi describing how a ship from\r\nCaffa conveyed the infection to Genoa, from which it spread to other\r\ndistricts and cities of Italy, must be deferred to the next chapter.\r\nHere a short space may be usefully devoted to a consideration of the\r\ndisease itself, which proved so destructive to human life in every\r\nEuropean country in the years 1348-1350. And, in the first place,\r\nit may be well to state that the name _Black Death_, by which the\r\ngreat pestilence is now generally known, not only in England, but\r\nelsewhere, is of comparatively modern origin.[14] In no contemporary\r\naccount of the epidemic is it called by that ominous title; at the\r\ntime people spoke of it as \"the pestilence,\" \"the great mortality,\"\r\n\"the death,\" \"the plague of Florence,\" etc., and, apparently, not\r\nuntil some centuries later was it given the name of \"the Black\r\nDeath.\" This it seems to have first received in Denmark or Sweden,\r\nalthough it is doubtful whether the _atra mors_ of Pontanus is\r\nequivalent to the English _Black Death_.[15] It is hard to resist the\r\nimpression that in England, at least, it was used as the recognised\r\nname for the epidemic of 1349 only after the pestilence of the 17th\r\ncentury had assumed to itself the title of the _Great Plague_.\r\nWhether the name _Black Death_ was first adopted to express the\r\nuniversal state of mourning to which the disease reduced the people\r\nof all [p007] countries, or to mark the special characteristic\r\nsymptoms of this epidemic, is, under the circumstances of its late\r\norigin, unimportant to determine.\r\n\r\nThe epidemic would appear to have been some form of the ordinary\r\nEastern or bubonic plague. Together, however, with the usual\r\ncharacteristic marks of the common plague, there were certain\r\npeculiar and very marked symptoms, which, although not universal, are\r\nrecorded very generally in European countries.\r\n\r\nIn its common form the disease showed itself in swellings and\r\ncarbuncles under the arm and in the groin. These were either few\r\nand large—being at times as large as a hen's egg—or smaller and\r\ndistributed over the body of the sufferer. In this the disease does\r\nnot appear to have been different from the ordinary bubonic plague,\r\nwhich ravaged Europe during many centuries, and which is perhaps best\r\nknown in England as so destructive to human life in the great plague\r\nof London in 1665. In this ordinary form it still exists in Eastern\r\ncountries, and its origin is commonly traced to the method of burying\r\nthe dead in vogue there.\r\n\r\nThe special symptoms characteristic of the plague of 1348-9 were four\r\nin number:—\r\n\r\n(1) Gangrenous inflammation of the throat and lungs;\r\n\r\n(2) Violent pains in the region of the chest;\r\n\r\n(3) The vomiting and spitting of blood; and\r\n\r\n(4) The pestilential odour coming from the bodies and breath of the\r\nsick.\r\n\r\nIn almost every detailed account by contemporary writers these\r\ncharacteristics are noted. And, although not all who were stricken\r\nwith the disease manifested it in this special form, it is clear\r\nthat, not only were many, and indeed vast numbers, carried off by\r\nrapid corruption of the lungs and blood-spitting, without any signs\r\nof swellings or carbuncles, but also that the disease was at the\r\ntime regarded as most deadly and fatal in this special form. \"From\r\nthe carbuncles and glandular swellings,\" says a contemporary writer,\r\n\"many recovered; from the [p008] blood-spitting none.\"[16] Matteo\r\nVillani, one of the most exact writers about this plague at Florence,\r\nsays that the sick \"who began to vomit blood quickly died;\"[17]\r\nwhilst Gui de Chauliac, the Pope's physician at Avignon, who watched\r\nthe course of the disease there and left the most valuable medical\r\naccount of his observations, says that the epidemic was of two kinds.\r\nThe first was marked by \"constant fever and blood-spitting, and from\r\nthis the patient died in three days;\" the second was the well-known\r\nand less fatal bubonic plague.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic symptoms of this epidemic, noted in numerous\r\ncontemporary accounts, appear to be identical with those of the\r\ndisease known as malignant pustule of the lung; and it would appear\r\nprobable that this outbreak of the plague must be distinguished from\r\nevery other of which there is any record. \"I express my profound\r\nconviction,\" writes an eminent French physician, \"that the Black\r\nDeath stands apart from all those which preceded or followed it. It\r\nought to be classed among the great and new popular maladies.\"[18]\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, the disease, as will be subsequently seen in the\r\naccounts of those who lived at the time, showed itself in various\r\nways. Some were struck suddenly, and died within a few hours; others\r\nfell into a deep sleep, from [p009] which they could not be roused;\r\nwhilst others, again, were racked with a sleepless fever, and\r\ntormented with a burning thirst. The usual course of the sickness,\r\nwhen it first made its appearance, was from three to five days; but\r\ntowards the close of the epidemic the recovery of those suffering\r\nfrom the carbuncular swellings was extended, as in the case of\r\nordinary Eastern plague, over many months.[19]\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief account of the disease which devastated the world\r\nin the middle of the fourteenth century. Before following the\r\ncourse of the epidemic in Italy, to which it was conveyed, as\r\nDe' Mussi relates, from the Crimea, some account of its ravages\r\nin Constantinople and in Sicily may be given. From the Crimea\r\nConstantinople lay upon the highway to the west. Italian ships\r\ncrossing the Black Sea [p010] would naturally touch at this city,\r\nthen the great centre of communication between the Eastern and\r\nWestern Worlds. From the relation of De' Mussi it appears that\r\nCaffa, the plague-stricken Genoese city in the Crimea, besieged by\r\nthe Tartars, was in communication by ship with countries from which\r\nit received supplies. To Constantinople, therefore, it seems not\r\nunlikely that the dreaded disease was conveyed by a ship coming from\r\nthis plague centre in the Crimea. An account of the pestilence at the\r\nImperial city has come from the pen of the Emperor John Cantacuzene,\r\nwho was an eye-witness of what he reports. And although he adopted\r\nthe language of Thucydides, about the plague of Athens, to describe\r\nhis own experiences at Constantinople, he could hardly have done so\r\nhad the description not been fairly faithful to the reality. \"The\r\nepidemic which then (1347) raged in northern Scythia,\" he writes,\r\n\"traversed almost the entire sea-coasts, whence it was carried over\r\nthe world. For it invaded not only Pontus, Thrace, and Macedonia, but\r\nGreece, Italy, the Islands, Egypt, Lybia, Judea, Syria, and almost\r\nthe entire universe.\"\r\n\r\nThe disease according to his account was incurable. Neither\r\nregularity of life nor bodily strength was any preservation against\r\nit. The strong and the weak were equally struck down; and death\r\nspared not those of whom care was taken, any more than the poor,\r\ndestitute of all help. No other illness of any sort showed itself\r\nin this year; all sickness took the form of the prevalent disease.\r\nMedical science recognised that it was powerless before the foe.\r\nThe course of the malady was not in all cases the same. Some people\r\ndied suddenly, others during the course of a day, and some after\r\nbut an hour's suffering. In the case of those who lingered for two\r\nor three days the attack commenced with a violent fever. Soon the\r\npoison mounted to the brain, and the sufferer lost the use of speech,\r\nbecame insensible to what was taking place about him, and appeared\r\nsunk in a deep sleep. If by chance he came to himself and tried to\r\nspeak [p011] his tongue refused to move, and only a few inarticulate\r\nsounds could be uttered, as the nerves had been paralysed; then he\r\ndied suddenly.\r\n\r\nOthers who fell sick under the disease were attacked first, not in\r\nthe head, but in the lungs. The organs of respiration became quickly\r\ninflamed, sharp pains were experienced in the chest, blood was\r\nvomited, and the breath became fetid. The throat and tongue, burnt up\r\nby the excessive fever, became black and congested with blood. \"Those\r\nwho drank copiously experienced no more relief than those who drank\r\nbut little.\"\r\n\r\nThen, after describing the terrible sleeplessness and restlessness\r\nof some sufferers, and the plague spots which broke out over the\r\nbody in most cases, the Emperor proceeds:—\"The few who recovered\r\nhad no second attack, or at least not of a serious nature.\" Even\r\nsome of those who manifested all the symptoms recovered against\r\nevery expectation. It is certain that no efficacious remedy has been\r\ndiscovered. What had been useful to one appeared a real poison to\r\nanother. People who nursed the sick took their malady, and on this\r\naccount the deaths multiplied to such an extent that many houses\r\nremained deserted, after all who had lived in them—even the domestic\r\nanimals—had been carried off by the plague.\r\n\r\nThe profound discouragement of the sick was specially sad to behold.\r\nOn the first symptoms of the attack men lost all hope of recovery,\r\nand gave themselves up as lost. This moral prostration quickly made\r\nthem worse and accelerated the hour of their death.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible in words to give an idea of this malady. All that\r\ncan be said is that it had nothing in common with the ills to which\r\nman is naturally subject, and that it was a chastisement sent by God\r\nHimself. By this belief many turned to better things and resolved\r\nto change their lives. I do not speak only of those who were swept\r\naway by the epidemic, but of those also who recovered and endeavoured\r\nto correct their vicious tendencies and devote themselves [p012]\r\nto the practice of virtue. A large number, too, before they were\r\nattacked distributed their goods to the poor, and there were none so\r\ninsensible or hard-hearted when attacked as not to show a profound\r\nsorrow for their faults so as to appear before the judgment seat of\r\nGod with the best chances of salvation.\r\n\r\n\"Amongst the innumerable victims of the epidemic in Constantinople\r\nmust be reckoned Andronicus, the Emperor's son, who died the third\r\nday. This young man was not only remarkable for his personal\r\nappearance, but was endowed in the highest degree with those\r\nqualities which form the chief adornment of youth; and everything\r\nabout him testified that he would have followed nobly in the\r\nfootsteps of his ancestors.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Constantinople the Italian trading ships passed on towards\r\ntheir own country, everywhere spreading the terrible contagion.\r\nTheir destinations were Genoa and Venice, as De' Mussi relates;\r\nbut as the same authority says: \"The sailors, as if accompanied by\r\nevil spirits, as soon as they approached the land, were death to\r\nthose with whom they mingled.\" Thus the advent of the plague can\r\nbe traced in the ports of the Adriatic in the autumn of 1347, and\r\nthere can be little doubt that it was due to the arrival of ships\r\nbound from the East to Venice. Of the islands of the ocean, and\r\nparticularly of Sicily, De' Mussi speaks as having been affected by\r\nthe ships that were bound from the Crimea to Genoa. Of the plague\r\nin Sicily there exists a particular account by one who must have\r\nbeen a contemporary of the events he describes.[20] \"A most deadly\r\npestilence,\" he says, \"sprang up over the entire island. It happened\r\nthat in the month of October, in the year of our Lord, 1347, about\r\nthe beginning of the month, twelve Genoese ships, flying from the\r\ndivine vengeance which our Lord for their sins had sent upon them,\r\nput into the port of Messina, bringing with them such a sickness\r\nclinging to their very bones [p013] that, did anyone speak to them,\r\nhe was directly struck with a mortal sickness from which there was\r\nno escape.\" After detailing the terrible symptoms and describing the\r\nrapid spread of the infection, how the mere breath of the strangers\r\npoisoned those who conversed with them, how to touch or meddle with\r\nanything that belonged to them was to contract the fatal malady, he\r\ncontinues: \"Seeing what a calamity of sudden death had come to them\r\nby the arrival of the Genoese, the people of Messina drove them in\r\nall haste from their city and port. But the sickness remained and\r\na terrible mortality ensued. The one thought in the mind of all\r\nwas how to avoid the infection. The father abandoned the sick son;\r\nmagistrates and notaries refused to come and make the wills of the\r\ndying; even the priests to hear their confessions. The care of those\r\nstricken fell to the Friars Minor, the Dominicans and members of\r\nother orders, whose convents were in consequence soon emptied of\r\ntheir inhabitants. Corpses were abandoned in empty houses, and there\r\nwas none to give them Christian burial. The houses of the dead were\r\nleft open and unguarded with their jewels, money, and valuables; if\r\nanyone wished to enter, there was no one to prevent him. The great\r\npestilence came so suddenly that there was no time to organise any\r\nmeasures of protection; from the very beginning the officials were\r\ntoo few, and soon there were none. The population deserted the city\r\nin crowds; fearing even to stay in the environs, they camped out\r\nin the open air in the vineyards, whilst some managed to put up at\r\nleast a temporary shelter for their families. Others, again, trusting\r\nin the protection of the virgin, blessed Agatha, sought refuge in\r\nCatania, whither the Queen of Sicily had gone, and where she directed\r\nher son, Don Frederick, to join her. The Messinese, in the month of\r\nNovember, persuaded the Patriarch[21] Archbishop of Catania to allow\r\nthe relics of the Saint to be taken to their city, but the people\r\nrefused to [p014] permit them to leave their ancient resting place.\r\nProcessions and pilgrimages were organised to beg God's favour. Still\r\nthe pestilence raged and with greater fury. Everyone was in too great\r\na terror to aid his neighbour. Flight profited nothing, for the\r\nsickness, already contracted and clinging to the fugitives, was only\r\ncarried wherever they sought refuge. Of those who fled some fell on\r\nthe roads and dragged themselves to die in the fields, the woods, or\r\nthe valleys. Those who reached Catania breathed their last in the\r\nhospitals. At the demand of the terrified populace the Patriarch\r\nforbade, under pain of excommunication, the burial of any of these\r\nMessina refugees within the city, and their bodies were all thrown\r\ninto deep pits outside the walls.\r\n\r\n\"What shall I say more?\" adds the historian. \"So wicked and timid\r\nwere the Catanians that they refused even to speak to any from\r\nMessina, or to have anything to do with them, but quickly fled at\r\ntheir approach. Had it not been for secret shelter afforded by some\r\nof their fellow citizens, resident in the town, the unfortunate\r\nrefugees would have been left destitute of all human aid.\" The\r\ncontagion, however, was already spread, and the plague soon became\r\nrife. The same scenes were enacted at Catania as before in Messina.\r\nThe Patriarch, desiring to provide for the souls of the people, gave\r\nto the priests, even the youngest, all the faculties he himself\r\npossessed, both episcopal and patriarchal, for absolving sins. \"The\r\npestilence raged in the city from October, 1347, to April, 1348, and\r\nthe Patriarch himself, Gerard Otho, of the Order of St. Francis, fell\r\na victim to his duty, and was one of the last to be carried off by\r\nthe disease. Duke John, who had sought security by avoiding every\r\ninfected house and person, died of the disease at the same time. The\r\nplague was spread in the same way from Messina throughout Sicily;\r\nSyracuse, Girgenti, Sciacca, and Trapani were successively attacked;\r\nin particular it raged in the district of Trapani, in the extreme\r\nwest of the island, [p015] which,\" says the writer, \"has remained\r\nalmost without population.\"[22]\r\n\r\nHaving briefly noticed the origin of the great pestilence which\r\nravaged Europe in the fourteenth century, and its progress towards\r\nItaly, the story of Gabriel de' Mussi may again be taken up at the\r\npoint where he describes the flight of the Genoese traders from the\r\nCrimea. The narrative has so far anticipated his account only by\r\ngiving the history of the epidemic in Constantinople and Sicily.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] Muratori, _Rerum Italicarum Scriptores_, xiv, col. 14.\r\n\r\n[3] _The Epidemics of the Middle Ages_, translated by B.

In 1316 Pope John XXII issued a Bull making it the\r\ncathedral city of an extensive diocese. By the time of the outbreak\r\nof the great plague it had become the centre of almost all commerce\r\nbetween Asia and Europe (_Cf._ M. G. Canale, _Della Crimea, del suo\r\ncommercio et dei suoi dominatori_, i, p. 208 _et seq._)\r\n\r\n[10] The account of Gabriele de' Mussi, called _Ystoria de morbo seu\r\nmortalitate qui fuit a. 1348_, was first printed by Henschel, in\r\nHaeser's _Archiv für gesammte Medicin_ (Jena) ii, 26-59. The editor\r\nclaims that De' Mussi was actually present at Caffa during the Tartar\r\nsiege, and came to Europe in the plague-stricken ships which conveyed\r\nthe infection to Italy. Signor Tononi, who in 1884 reprinted the\r\n_Ystoria_ in the _Giornale Ligustico_ (Genoa) vol. x (1883), p. 139\r\n_seqq._, has proved by the acts of the notaries of Piacenza that\r\nDe' Mussi never quitted the city at this time, and his realistic\r\nnarrative must have been consequently derived from the accounts of\r\nothers. From the same source Tononi has shown that De' Mussi acted as\r\nnotary between A.D. 1300 and 1356, and was consequently born probably\r\nsomewhere about 1280.

The idea that this peculiar malady was altogether novel in\r\ncharacter is confirmed by its specially malignant nature. According\r\nto a well-recognized law new epidemics are always most violent and\r\nfatal. The depopulation of the Fiji Islands by the measles is an\r\ninstance of the way in which a comparatively mild disease may in its\r\nfirst attack upon a people prove terribly destructive. It is commonly\r\nthought that it has been the action of some new disease whereby the\r\nraces which built the great prehistoric cities of Africa and America\r\nhave been completely swept away.\r\n\r\n[19] The following account of an outbreak of disease somewhat similar\r\nto the \"Black Death\" appeared in the _British Medical Journal_ of\r\n5 November, 1892:—\"An official report of the Governor-General of\r\nTurkestan, which has recently been published in St. Petersburg,\r\nstates that that province has been severely visited by an epidemic\r\nof 'Black Death,' which followed upon the footsteps of cholera. On\r\nSeptember 10 (22) it appeared suddenly at Askabad, and in six days\r\nit killed 1,303 persons in a population of 30,000. 'Black Death'\r\nhas long been known in Western Asia as a scourge more deadly than\r\nthe cholera or the plague. It comes suddenly, sweeping over a whole\r\ndistrict like a pestilential simoon, striking down animals as well\r\nas men, and vanishes as suddenly as it came, before there is time\r\nto ascertain its nature or its mode of diffusion. The visit here\r\nreferred to was no exception to this rule. After raging in Askabad\r\nfor six days the epidemic ceased, leaving no trace of its presence\r\nbut the corpses of its victims. These putrified so rapidly that\r\nno proper post-mortem could be made. The Governor-General gives\r\nsome details as to the symptoms and course of the disease, which,\r\nthough interesting as far as they go, do not throw much light on\r\nits pathology. The attack begins with rigors of intense severity,\r\nthe patient shivering literally from head to foot; the rigors occur\r\nevery five minutes for about an hour. Next an unendurable feeling of\r\nheat is complained of; the arteries become tense, and the pulse more\r\nand more rapid, while the temperature steadily rises. Unfortunately\r\nno thermometric readings or other precise data are given. Neither\r\ndiarrhœa nor vomiting has been observed. Convulsions alternate with\r\nsyncopal attacks, and the patients suffer intense pain. Suddenly\r\nthe extremities become stiff and cold, and in from 10 to 20 minutes\r\nthe patient sinks into a comatose condition, which speedily ends in\r\ndeath. Immediately after he has ceased to breathe large black bullæ\r\nform on the body, and quickly spread over its surface. Decomposition\r\ntakes place in a few minutes.\"\r\n\r\n[20] A Franciscan friar, Michael Platiensis (of Piazza).\r\n\r\n[21] The Archbishop was a member of the Order of St. Francis, and had\r\nbeen created Patriarch of Antioch.\r\n\r\n[22] Gregorio (R.), _Bibliotheca Scriptorum qui res in Sicilia gestas\r\nretulere_, tom. i, p. 562 _seqq._ The historian wrote probably not\r\nlater than A.D. 1361.\r\n\r\n[p016]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE EPIDEMIC IN ITALY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great sickness reached Italy in the early days of 1348. The\r\nreport at Avignon at the time was that three plague-stricken vessels\r\nhad put into the port of Genoa in January, whilst from another\r\nsource it would appear that at the same time another ship brought\r\nthe contagion from the East to Venice. From these two places the\r\nepidemic quickly spread over the entire country. What happened in\r\nthe early days of this frightful scourge is best told in the actual\r\nwords of Gabriel de' Mussi, who possessed special means of knowledge,\r\nand who has until quite recently been looked upon, but incorrectly,\r\nas a passenger by one of the very vessels which brought the plague\r\nfrom the Crimea to Genoa. The history of the progress of the plague\r\nmay be gathered from the pages of the detailed chronicles, which at\r\nthat time recorded the principal events in the various large and\r\nprosperous cities of the Italian peninsula, as well as from the\r\nwell-known account of the straits to which Florence was reduced\r\nby the sickness, given in the introduction to the \"Decameron\" of\r\nBoccaccio.\r\n\r\nOn reviewing in detail the testimonies from every land relating to\r\nthis great calamity, it is impossible to overlook the sameness of\r\nthe terms in which writers the most diverse in character, and in\r\nplaces far distant from one another, describe what passed before\r\ntheir eyes. It has already been remarked that the imperial historian,\r\nJohn Cantacuzene, in recounting the horrors of the plague in\r\nConstantinople, has borrowed from Thucydides. But the same ideas, the\r\nvery same words, suggest themselves involuntarily to one and all.\r\nThe simple monastic annalist of the half-buried [p017] cloister in\r\nEngelberg, the more courtly chronicler of St. Denis, the notary who\r\nwrites with the dryness and technicalities of his profession, but\r\ndisplays withal a weakness for rhetoric and gossip, _littérateurs_\r\nlike Boccaccio, whose _forte_ is narrative, or like Petrarch,\r\ndelighting in a show of words, the business-like town chronicler of\r\nan Italian city, and the author who aspires to the rank of historian,\r\nthe physician whose interest is professional, even the scribbler who\r\ntakes this strange theme as the subject for his jingling verse, all\r\nspeak with such complete oneness of expression that it would almost\r\nseem that each had copied his neighbour, and that there is here a\r\nfine theme for the scientific amusement known as \"investigation\r\nof sources.\" It is only when we come to examine the whole body of\r\nevidence that there is borne in upon the mind a realisation of the\r\nnature of a calamity which, spreading everywhere, was everywhere the\r\nsame in its horrors, becoming thus nothing less than a world-wide\r\ntragedy, and it is seen that even the phrases of the rhetorician can\r\ndo no more than rise to the terrible reality of fact.\r\n\r\nFirst in importance, as well as in order of time, comes the testimony\r\nof De' Mussi, the substance of which is here given. It so happened\r\nthat when the ships left Caffa—some bound for Genoa, some for Venice,\r\nand some to other parts of the Christian world—a few of the sailors\r\nwere already infected by the fatal disease. One sick man was enough\r\nto infect the whole household, and the corpse as it was carried to\r\nthe grave brought death to its bearers. \"Tell, O Sicily, and ye, the\r\nmany islands of the sea, the judgments of God. Confess, O Genoa, what\r\nthou hast done, since we of Genoa and Venice are compelled to make\r\nGod's chastisement manifest. Alas! our ships enter the port, but of\r\na thousand sailors hardly ten are spared. We reach our homes; our\r\nkindred and our neighbours come from all parts to visit us. Woe to\r\nus for we cast at them the darts of death! Whilst we spoke to them,\r\nwhilst they embraced us and kissed us, we scattered [p018] the\r\npoison from our lips. Going back to their homes, they in turn soon\r\ninfected their whole families, who in three days succumbed, and were\r\nburied in one common grave. Priests and doctors visiting the sick\r\nreturned from their duties ill, and soon were numbered with the dead.\r\nO, death! cruel, bitter, impious death! which thus breaks the bonds\r\nof affection and divides father and mother, brother and sister, son\r\nand wife.\r\n\r\n\"Lamenting our misery, we feared to fly, yet we dared not remain.\"\r\nThe terror increased when it was found that even the effects and\r\nclothes of the dead were capable of communicating the disease.\r\nThis was seen in the case of four soldiers at a place near Genoa.\r\nReturning to their camp they carried back with them a woollen\r\nbed-covering they had found in a house at Rivarolo, on the sea-coast,\r\nwhere the sickness had swept away the entire population. The night\r\nfollowing the four slept under the coverlet, and in the morning all\r\nwere found to be dead. At Genoa the plague spared hardly a seventh\r\npart of the population. At Venice it is said that more than seventy\r\ndied out of every hundred, and out of four-and-twenty excellent\r\ndoctors twenty were soon carried off by the sickness.\r\n\r\n\"But as an inhabitant I am asked to write more of Piacenza so that\r\nit may be known what happened there in the year 1348. Some Genoese\r\nwho fled from the plague raging in their city betook themselves\r\nhither. They rested at Bobbio, and there sold the merchandise they\r\nhad brought with them. The purchaser and their host, together with\r\nall his family and many neighbours, were quickly stricken with the\r\nsickness and died. One of these, wishing to make his will, called\r\na notary, his confessor, and the necessary witnesses. The next day\r\nall these were buried together. So greatly did the calamity increase\r\nthat nearly all the inhabitants of Bobbio soon fell a prey to the\r\nsickness, and there remained in the town only the dead.\r\n\r\n\"In the spring of 1348 another Genoese infected with the plague came\r\nto Piacenza. He sought out his friend Fulchino [p019] della Croce,\r\nwho took him into his house. Almost immediately afterwards he died,\r\nand the said Fulchino was also quickly carried off with his entire\r\nfamily and many of his neighbours. In a brief space the plague was\r\nrife throughout the city. I know not where to begin; everywhere there\r\nwas weeping and mourning. So great was the mortality that men hardly\r\ndared to breathe. The dead were without number, and those who still\r\nlived gave themselves up as lost, and prepared for the tomb.\r\n\r\n\"The cemeteries failing, it was necessary to dig trenches to receive\r\nthe bodies of the dead. It frequently happened that a husband\r\nand wife, a father and son, a mother and daughter—nay, whole\r\nfamilies—were cast together in the same pit.\r\n\r\n\"It was the same in the neighbouring towns and villages. One Oberto\r\ndi Sasso, who had come one day from an infected place to the church\r\nof the Friars Minor to make his will, called thither a notary,\r\nwitnesses, and neighbours. All these, together with others, to the\r\nnumber of more than sixty, died within a short space of time. Also\r\nthe religious man, friar Sifredo de' Bardi, of the convent and\r\norder of Preachers, a man of prudence and great learning, who had\r\nvisited our Lord's sepulchre, died with twenty-three other members\r\nof his order and convent. Also the learned and virtuous friar\r\nBertolin Coxadocha, of Piacenza, of the order of Minorites, with\r\nfour-and-twenty members of his community was carried off. So too of\r\nthe convent of Augustinian Hermits—seven; of the Carmelites—seven;\r\nof the Servites of Mary—four, and more than sixty dignitaries and\r\nrectors of churches in the city and district of Piacenza died. Of\r\nnobles, too, many; of young people a vast number.\"\r\n\r\nDe' Mussi then proceeds to give examples of the scenes daily passing\r\nbefore his eyes in the plague-stricken cities of northern Italy. The\r\nsick man lay languishing alone in his house and no one came near\r\nhim. Those most dear to him, regardless of the ties of kindred or\r\naffection, [p020] withdrew themselves to a distance; the doctor\r\ndid not come to him, and even the priest with fear and trembling\r\nadministered the Sacraments of the Church. Men and women, racked with\r\nthe consuming fever, pleaded—but in vain—for a draught of water, and\r\nuselessly raved for someone to watch at their bedside. The father or\r\nthe wife would not touch the corpse of child or husband to prepare it\r\nfor the grave, or follow it thither. No prayer was said, nor solemn\r\noffice sung, nor bell tolled for the funeral of even the noblest\r\ncitizen; but by day and night the corpses were borne to the common\r\nplague-pit without rite or ceremony. The doors of the houses now\r\ndesolate and empty remained closed, and no one cared, nor, indeed,\r\ndared to enter.\r\n\r\nSuch is the picture of the effect of the malady and the terrible\r\nmortality caused by it drawn by one who seems to have seen its first\r\nintroduction into Italy, and who certainly had the best opportunity\r\nof early observing its rapid progress. It might, perhaps, be\r\nthought that his description of the horrors of the infected cities\r\nwas over-coloured and the creation of his imagination. But in the\r\ndetails it bears on the surface the stamp of truth, and in its chief\r\ncharacteristics it is confirmed by too many independent witnesses in\r\nother parts of Italy, and even in Europe generally, to leave a doubt\r\nthat it corresponded to the literal reality.\r\n\r\nWhat happened at Florence is well-known through the graphic\r\ndescription of Boccaccio. So terrible was the mortality in that\r\nprosperous city that the very outbreak became for a time known in\r\nEurope as the \"Pestilence of Florence.\" In the spring of the previous\r\nyear (1347) a severe famine had been experienced, and some 94,000\r\npeople had been in receipt of State relief, whilst about 4,000 are\r\nsupposed to have perished of starvation in the city[23] and its\r\nneighbourhood. The people, enfeebled by previous hardships, would\r\nnaturally fall a prey more easily [p021] to the poison of the\r\nepidemic. In April, 1348, the dreaded infection began to show itself.\r\n\"To cure the malady,\" writes Boccaccio, \"neither medical knowledge\r\nnor the power of drugs was of any avail, whether because the disease\r\nwas in its own nature mortal, or that the physicians (the number\r\nof whom—taking quacks and women pretenders into account—was grown\r\nvery great) could form no just idea of the cause, nor consequently\r\nground a true method of cure; of those attacked few or none escaped,\r\nbut they generally died the third day from the first appearance of\r\nthe symptoms, without a fever or other form of illness manifesting\r\nitself. The disease was communicated by the sick to those in health\r\nand seemed daily to gain head and increase in violence, just as fire\r\nwill do by casting fresh fuel on it. The contagion was communicated\r\nnot only by conversation with those sick, but also by approaching\r\nthem too closely, or even by merely handling their clothes or\r\nanything they had previously touched.\r\n\r\n\"What I am going to relate is certainly marvellous, and, had I not\r\nseen it with my own eyes, and were there not many witnesses to\r\nattest its truth besides myself, I should not venture to recount it,\r\nwhatever the credit of persons who had informed me of it. Such, I\r\nsay, was the deadly character of the pestilential matter, that it\r\npassed the infection not only from man to man; but, what is more\r\nwonderful, and has been often proved, anything belonging to those\r\nsick with the disease, if touched by any other creature, would\r\ncertainly affect and even kill it in a short space of time. One\r\ninstance of this kind I took special note of, namely, the rags of a\r\npoor man just dead having been thrown into the street, two hogs came\r\nby at the time and began to root amongst them, shaking them in their\r\njaws. In less than an hour they fell down and died on the spot.\r\n\r\n\"Strange were the devices resorted to by the survivors to secure\r\ntheir safety. Divers as were the means, there was one feature common\r\nto all, selfish and uncharitable as it [p022] was—the avoidance of\r\nthe sick, and of everything that had been near them; men thought only\r\nof themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Some held it was best to lead a temperate life and to avoid every\r\nexcess. These making up parties together, and shutting themselves up\r\nfrom the rest of the world, ate and drank moderately of the best,\r\ndiverting themselves with music and such other entertainments as they\r\nmight have at home, and never listening to news from without which\r\nmight make them uneasy. Others maintained that free living was a\r\nbetter preservative, and would gratify every passion and appetite.\r\nThey would drink and revel incessantly in tavern after tavern, or in\r\nthose private houses which, frequently found deserted by the owners,\r\nwere therefore open to anyone; but they yet studiously avoided, with\r\nall their irregularity, coming near the infected. And such at that\r\ntime was the public distress that the laws, human and divine, were\r\nnot regarded, for the officers to put them in force being either\r\ndead, sick, or without assistants, everyone did just as he pleased.\"\r\n\r\nAnother class of people chose a middle course. They neither\r\nrestricted themselves to the diet of the former nor gave way to\r\nthe intemperance of the latter; but eating and drinking what their\r\nappetites required, they went about everywhere with scents and\r\nnosegays to smell at, since they looked upon the whole atmosphere as\r\ntainted with the effluvia arising from the dead bodies.\r\n\r\n\"Others, again, of a more callous disposition declared, as perhaps\r\nthe safest course in the extremity, that the only remedy was\r\nin flight. Persuaded, therefore, of this, and thinking only of\r\nthemselves, great numbers of men and women left the city, their\r\ngoods, their house, and kindred, and fled into the country parts; as\r\nif the wrath of God had been restricted to a visitation of those only\r\nwithin the city walls, and hence none should remain in the doomed\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\"But different as were the courses pursued, the sickness fell upon\r\nall these classes without distinction; neither did [p023] all of any\r\nclass die, nor did all escape; and they who first set the example of\r\nforsaking others now languished themselves where there was no one\r\nto take pity on them. I pass by the little regard that citizens and\r\ndistant relations showed one to the other, for the terror was such\r\nthat brother even fled from brother, wife from husband, nay, the\r\nparent from her own child. The sick could obtain help only from the\r\nfew who still obeyed the law of charity, or from hired servants who\r\ndemanded extravagant wages and were fit for little else than to hand\r\nwhat was asked for, and to note when the patient died. Even such\r\npaid helpers were scarce, and their desire of gain frequently cost\r\nthem their lives. The rich passed out of this world without a single\r\nperson to aid them; few had the tears of friends at their departure.\r\nThe corpse was attended to the grave only by fellows hired for the\r\npurpose, who would put the bier on their shoulders and hurry with it\r\nto the nearest church, where it was consigned to the tomb without any\r\nceremony whatever, and wherever there was room.\r\n\r\n\"With regard to the lower classes, and, indeed, in the case of many\r\nof the middle rank of life, the scenes enacted were sadder still.\r\nThey fell sick by thousands, and, having no one whatever to attend\r\nthem, most of them died. Some breathed their last in the streets,\r\nothers shut up in their own houses, when the effluvia which came\r\nfrom their corpses was the first intimation of their deaths. An\r\narrangement was now made for the neighbours, assisted by such bearers\r\nas they could get, to clear the houses, and every morning to lay the\r\nbodies of the dead at their doors. Thence the corpses were carried\r\nto the grave on a bier, two or three at a time. There was no one\r\nto follow, none to shed tears, for things had come to such a pass\r\nthat men's lives were no more thought of than those of beasts. Even\r\nfriends would laugh and make themselves merry, and women had learned\r\nto consider their own lives before everything else.\r\n\r\n\"Consecrated ground no longer sufficed, and it became [p024]\r\nnecessary to dig trenches, into which the bodies were put by\r\nhundreds, laid in rows as goods packed in a ship; a little earth was\r\ncast upon each successive layer until the pits were filled to the\r\ntop. The adjacent country presented the same picture as the city; the\r\npoor distressed labourers and their families, without physicians,\r\nand without help, languished on the highways, in the fields, in\r\ntheir own cottages, dying like cattle rather than human beings. The\r\ncountry people, like the citizens, grew dissolute in their manners\r\nand careless of everything. They supposed that each day might be\r\ntheir last; and they took no care nor thought how to improve their\r\nsubstance, or even to utilise it for present support. The flocks and\r\nherds, when driven from their homes, would wander unwatched through\r\nthe forsaken harvest fields, and were left to return of their own\r\naccord, if they would, at the approach of night.\"\r\n\r\nBetween March and the July following it was estimated that upwards of\r\na hundred thousand souls had perished in the city alone.\r\n\r\n\"What magnificent dwellings,\" the writer continues, \"what stately\r\npalaces, were then rendered desolate, even to the last inhabitant!\r\nHow many noble families became extinct! What riches, what vast\r\npossessions were left with no known heir to inherit them! What\r\nnumbers of both sexes, in the prime and vigour of youth, whom in\r\nthe morning Galen, Hippocrates, or Æsculapius himself, would have\r\ndeclared in perfect health, after dining heartily with their friends\r\nhere, have supped with their departed friends in another world.\"[24]\r\n\r\nIt might perhaps be suspected that this description of Boccaccio\r\nas to the terrible nature of the plague in Florence was either a\r\nfancy picture of his imagination or intended merely as a rhetorical\r\nintroduction to the tales told in the \"Decameron,\" with only a\r\nslender foundation of fact. Unfortunately other authorities are\r\nforthcoming to confirm [p025] the graphic relation of the Florentine\r\npoet in all its details. Amongst others who were carried off by the\r\npestilence in Florence was the renowned historian, Giovanni Villani.\r\nHis work was taken up by his brother Matteo, who commences his annals\r\nwith an account of the epidemic. So terrible did the destruction of\r\nhuman life appear to him that he tells his readers that no greater\r\ncatastrophe had fallen on the world since the universal Deluge.\r\nAccording to his testimony, it involved the whole of the Italian\r\npeninsula, with the exception of Milan and some Alpine districts of\r\nnorthern Lombardy. In each place visited by the scourge it lasted\r\nfive months, and everywhere Christian parents abandoned their\r\nchildren and kinsfolk, in as callous a way as \"might perhaps be\r\nexpected from infidels and savages.\" As regards Florence, whilst\r\nsome few devoted themselves to the care of the sick, many fled from\r\nthe plague-stricken city. The epidemic raged there from April till\r\nSeptember, 1348, and it is the opinion of Villani that three out of\r\nevery five persons in the city and neighbourhood fell victims to\r\nit. As to the effect of the scourge on the survivors, the historian\r\nrecords that whilst it would naturally have been expected that men,\r\nimpressed by so terrible a chastisement, would have become better,\r\nthe very contrary was the fact. Work, too, was given over, and \"men\r\ngave themselves up to the enjoyment of the worldly riches to which\r\nthey had succeeded.\" Idleness, dissolute morals, sins of gluttony,\r\nbanquets, revels in taverns, unbridled luxury, fickleness in dress\r\nand constant changes according to whim, such were the characteristic\r\nmarks of the well-to-do Italian citizens when the plague had passed.\r\nAnd the poor, also, Villani states, became idle and unwilling to\r\nwork, considering that when so many had been carried off by the\r\npestilence there could not but be an abundance for those whom\r\nProvidence had spared.[25] [p026]\r\n\r\nThe same story is told in all the contemporary chronicles of Italian\r\ncities. At Pisa the terrible mortality lasted till September, 1348,\r\nand there were few families that did not reckon two or three of their\r\nmembers among the dead. Many names are said to have been completely\r\nwiped off from the roll of the living. At least a hundred each\r\nweek were carried to the grave in the city, whilst those who had\r\nbeen bold enough to watch at the death-bed of a relation or friend\r\nappealed in vain to passers-by to aid them to bury the corpse. \"Help\r\nus to bear this body to the pit,\" they cried, \"so that we in our\r\nturn may deserve to find some to carry us.\" The awful suddenness\r\nof the death often inflicted by the scourge is noted by the author\r\nof the \"Chronicle of Pisa,\" in common with nearly every writer of\r\nthis period. Men who in the morning were apparently well had before\r\nevening been carried to the grave.[26]\r\n\r\nA Paduan chronicler, writing at the time, notes that one sick man as\r\na rule infected the house in which he lay, so that once the sickness\r\nentered into a dwelling all were seized by it, \"even the animals.\"\r\nTo Padua a stranger brought the sickness, and in a brief space the\r\nwhole city was suffering from it. Hardly a third of the population\r\nwas left after the scourge had passed.[27] At Siena, according to\r\nDi Tura, a contemporary chronicler, the plague commenced in April\r\nand lasted till October, 1348. All who could fled from the stricken\r\ncity. In May, July, and August so many died that neither position\r\nnor money availed to procure porters to carry the dead to the public\r\npits. \"And I, Agniolo di Tura,\" writes this author, \"carried with my\r\nown hands my five little sons to the pit; and what I did many others\r\ndid likewise.\" All expected death, and people generally said, and\r\nbelieved, that the end of the world had certainly come. In Siena and\r\nits [p027] neighbourhood, according to Di Tura, about 80,000 people\r\nwere thought to have died in these seven months.[28]\r\n\r\nAt Orvieto the plague began in May. Some 500 died in a very short\r\nspace of time, many of them suddenly; the shops remained closed,\r\nand business and work was at a standstill. Here it ran its usual\r\nfive months' course, and finished in September, when many families\r\nwere found to have become extinct.[29] At Rimini it was noticed that\r\nthe poor were the first to be attacked and the chief sufferers. The\r\nsickness first showed itself on May 15th, 1348, and only died out\r\nin the following December, when, according to the computation of\r\nthe chronicler, two out of three of the inhabitants had been swept\r\naway.[30]\r\n\r\nAn anonymous contemporary Italian writer describes the sickness as a\r\n\"swift and sharp fever, with blood-spitting, carbuncle or fistula.\"\r\nOnly the few, he says, recovered when once stricken with the disease.\r\nThe sick visibly infected with their corruption the healthy, even by\r\ntalking with them; for from this mere conversing with the sick an\r\ninfinite number of men and women died and are buried. \"And here,\"\r\nsays the writer, \"I can give my testimony. A certain man bled me, and\r\nthe blood flowing touched his face. On that same day he was taken\r\nill, and the next he died; and by the mercy of God I have escaped.\r\nI note this because, as by mere communication with the sick the\r\nplague infected mortally the healthy, the father afterwards avoided\r\nhis stricken son, the brother his brother, the wife her husband,\r\nand so in each case the man in health studiously avoided the sick.\r\nPriests and doctors even fled in fear from those ill, and all\r\navoided the dead. In many places and houses [p028] when an inmate\r\ndied the rest quickly, one after another, expired. And so great was\r\nthe overwhelming number of the dead that it was necessary to open\r\nnew cemeteries in every place. In Venice there were almost 100,000\r\ndead, and so great was the multitude of corpses everywhere that few\r\nattended any funeral or dirge. . . . This pestilence did not cease in\r\nthe land from February till the feast of All Saints (November 1st,\r\n1348), and the offices of the dead were chanted only by the voices\r\nof boys; which boys, without learning, and by rote only, sang the\r\noffice walking through the streets.\" The writer then notices the\r\ngeneral dissoluteness which ensued after the disease, and its effect\r\nin lowering the standard of probity and morals.[31]\r\n\r\nTo the terrible accounts given by De' Mussi of the state of\r\nplague-stricken Genoa and Piacenza, and that of Boccaccio, of the\r\nravages of the pestilence in the city of Florence, may be well added\r\nthe eloquent letters of the poet Petrarch, in which he laments the\r\noverwhelming catastrophe, as he experienced it in the town of Parma.\r\nHere, as in so many other places, the inhabitants vainly endeavoured\r\nto prevent the entry of the disease by forbidding all intercourse\r\nwith the suffering cities of Florence, Venice, Genoa and Pisa. The\r\nmeasures taken to isolate Parma appear to have been, at least, for\r\na time, successful, as the dreaded plague apparently did not make\r\nits appearance till the beginning of June, 1348.[32] But in the six\r\nmonths during which it lasted it desolated the entire neighbourhood.\r\nIn Parma and Reggio many thousands, estimated roundly at 40,000,\r\nwere carried off by it.[33] Petrarch was at this period a canon of\r\nthe cathedral of Parma, and had made the acquaintance at Avignon of\r\nLaura, who quickly became the object of his admiration as a typical\r\nChristian mother of a family, and as a fitting subject to inspire\r\nhis poetic muse. Laura died at Avignon, one of the [p029] many who\r\nfell victims to the great pestilence which was then raging in that\r\ncity. The letter written by a friend named Louis to inform Petrarch\r\nof this death found him at Parma on May 19th, 1348.[34] A month later\r\nthe poet wrote to Avignon in the most heart-broken language to his\r\nbrother, a religious at Monrieux, and the only survivor of a convent\r\nof five-and-thirty.[35] \"My brother! my brother! my brother,\" he\r\nwrote. \"A new beginning to a letter, though used by Marcus Tullius\r\nfourteen hundred years ago. Alas! my beloved brother, what shall I\r\nsay? How shall I begin? Whither shall I turn? On all sides is sorrow;\r\neverywhere is fear. I would, my brother, that I had never been born,\r\nor, at least, had died before these times. How will posterity believe\r\nthat there has been a time when without the lightnings of heaven or\r\nthe fires of earth, without wars or other visible slaughter, not\r\nthis or that part of the earth, but well-nigh the whole globe, has\r\nremained without inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\"When has any such thing been ever heard or seen; in what annals has\r\nit ever been read that houses were left vacant, cities deserted, the\r\ncountry neglected, the fields too small for the dead, and a fearful\r\nand universal solitude over the whole earth? Consult your historians,\r\nthey are silent; question your doctors, they are dumb; seek an answer\r\nfrom your philosophers, they shrug their shoulders and frown, and\r\nwith their fingers to their lips bid you be silent.\r\n\r\n\"Will posterity ever believe these things when we, who see, can\r\nscarcely credit them? We should think we were dreaming if we did not\r\nwith our eyes, when we walk abroad, see the city in mourning with\r\nfunerals, and returning to our home, find it empty, and thus know\r\nthat what we lament is real.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, happy people of the future, who have not known these miseries\r\nand perchance will class our testimony with [p030] the fables. We\r\nhave, indeed, deserved these (punishments) and even greater; but our\r\nforefathers also have deserved them, and may our posterity not also\r\nmerit the same.\"\r\n\r\nThen, after saying that the universal misery is enough to make one\r\nthink that God has ceased to have a care for His creatures, and\r\nputting this thought aside as blasphemy, the writer continues: \"But\r\nwhatever the causes and however hidden, the effects are manifest. To\r\nturn from public to private sorrows; the first part of the second\r\nyear is passed since I returned to Italy. I do not ask you to look\r\nback any further; count these few days, and think what we were and\r\nwhat we are. Where are now our pleasant friends? Where the loved\r\nfaces? Where their cheering words? Where their sweet and gentle\r\nconversation? We were surrounded by a crowd of intimates, now we are\r\nalmost alone.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of one special friend, Paganinus of Milan, Petrarch writes:\r\n\"He was suddenly seized in the evening by the pestilential sickness.\r\nAfter supping with friends he spent some time in conversation with\r\nme, in the enjoyment of our common friendship and in talking over our\r\naffairs. He passed the night bravely in the last agony, and in the\r\nmorning was carried off by a swift death. And, that no horror should\r\nbe wanting, in three days his sons and all his family had followed\r\nhim to the tomb.\"[36]\r\n\r\nIn other towns of Italy the same tragedy, as told in the words of\r\nBoccaccio and Petrarch, was being enacted during the early spring and\r\nthe summer months of 1348. At Venice, where the pestilence obtained\r\nan early foothold, and the position of which rendered it particularly\r\nsusceptible to infection, the mortality was so great that it was\r\nrepresented by the round numbers of 100,000 souls.[37]\r\n\r\nSignor Cecchetti's researches into the history of the medical faculty\r\nat Venice at this period furnish many [p031] interesting details\r\nas to the spread of the sickness.[38] Although surgeons were not\r\nallowed by law to practise medicine, so great was the need during\r\nthe prevalence of the dread mortality that one surgeon, Andrea di\r\nPadova, was allowed to have saved the lives of more than a hundred\r\npeople by his timely assistance.[39] In the 14th century Venice was\r\ntroubled by the plague some fifteen times, but that of 1348 was\r\n\"the great epidemic\"—\"the horrible mortality\"—to the chroniclers of\r\nthe time. For a long period after, public and other documents make\r\nit the excuse for all kinds of irregularities.[40] The diplomas of\r\nmerit bestowed upon doctors who remained faithful to their posts by\r\nthe authorities of Venice speak of death following upon the first\r\ninfection within a very short space of time. So depopulated was the\r\ncity that it might be said no one was left in it. Many doctors fled,\r\nothers shut themselves in their houses. Artisans and even youths\r\nundertook the duties of physicians, and helped numbers to recover.[41]\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, March 30th, 1348, the Great Council of Venice chose a\r\ncommission of three to watch over the public safety. These a few days\r\nlater ordered deep pits to be made in one of the islands to receive\r\nthe bodies of those who died in the hospitals and of the poor, and to\r\nconvey them thither, ships were appointed to be always in waiting.\r\n\r\nThe rich fled from the place; officials could not be found, and the\r\nGreat Council was so reduced that the legal number for transacting\r\nbusiness could not be got together. Notaries died in great numbers,\r\nand the prisons were thrown open.[42] When the epidemic had ceased\r\nthe Senate had great difficulty in finding three doctors for the\r\ncity. On January 12th, 1349, Marco Leon, a capable physician, and a\r\nnative of Venice, who was in practice at Perugia, offered to return\r\nto his own city \"since,\" as he says, \"it has pleased God by the\r\nterrible mortality to leave our native [p032] place so destitute\r\nof upright and capable doctors that it may be said not one has been\r\nleft.\"[43]\r\n\r\nDetails of a similar nature might be multiplied from the contemporary\r\nItalian records. What has been here given, however, will enable the\r\nreader to form some estimate of the nature of the terrible disease\r\nand of the extent of the universal devastation of the Italian\r\npeninsula. The annals relate that in every city, castle, and town\r\ndeath and desolation reigned supreme. In most places, as in Pisa, for\r\nexample, law and order became things of the past; the administration\r\nof justice was impossible; criminals of every kind did what they\r\nbest pleased,[44] and for a considerable time after the plague\r\nhad passed the Courts of Law were occupied in disputes over the\r\npossessions of the dead. When the wave of pestilence had rolled on\r\nto other lands there came in its wake famine and general distress\r\nin Italy, but strangely accompanied with the lavish expenditure of\r\nthose who considered that, where so many had died, there should be\r\nenough and to spare of worldly goods for such as were left. The\r\nland lay uncultivated and the harvest was unreaped. Provisions and\r\nother necessaries of life became dear. Markets ceased to be held,\r\nand cities and towns devoid of inhabitants were spectacles of decay\r\nand desolation. It is said, and there does not appear to be reason\r\nto doubt the statement, in view of the many contemporary accounts of\r\nthe disaster, that at least one half of the general population of\r\nItaly were swept away by the scourge. This relation of the horrors\r\nof the year 1348 in Italy may be closed by the account left us of\r\nsome students from Bohemia, who at this time journeyed back to their\r\ncountry from Bologna.\r\n\r\n\"At this time,\" says a chronicle of Prague, \"some students, coming\r\nfrom Bologna into Bohemia, saw that in most of the cities and castles\r\nthey passed through few remained alive, and in some all were dead.\r\nIn many houses [p033] also those who had escaped with their lives\r\nwere so weakened by the sickness that one could not give another a\r\ndraught of water, nor help him in any way, and so passed their time\r\nin great affliction and distress. Priests, too, ministering the\r\nsacraments, and doctors medicines, to the sick were infected by them\r\nand died, and so many passed out of this life without confession or\r\nthe sacraments of the Church, as the priests were dead. There were\r\ngenerally made great, broad and deep pits in which the bodies of the\r\ndead were buried. In many places, too, the air was more infected and\r\nmore deadly than poisoned food, from the corruption of the corpses,\r\nsince there was no one left to bury them. Of the foresaid students,\r\nmoreover, only one returned to Bohemia, and his companions all died\r\non the journey.\"[45]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[23] Sismondi, _Histoire des Républiques Italiennes du Moyen Age_,\r\nvi, p. 11.\r\n\r\n[24] \"The Decameron,\" Introduction.\r\n\r\n[25] Muratori, _Scriptores_, xiv, coll. 11-15.\r\n\r\n[26] Muratori, _Scriptores_, xv. 1021.\r\n\r\n[27] _Ibid._, xii, 926.\r\n\r\n[28] _Ibid._ xv, 123.

According to a\r\ncontemporary account, written at Avignon in 1348, the disease was\r\nbrought into Marseilles by one of the three Genoese ships, which\r\nhad been compelled to leave the port of Genoa when the inhabitants\r\ndiscovered that by their means the dreaded plague had already\r\ncommenced its ravages in their city. It would consequently appear\r\nmost likely that the mortality began in Marseilles somewhere about\r\nthe first days of January, 1348, although one account places the\r\ncommencement of the sickness as early as All Saints' Day (November\r\n1), 1347.[46] The number of deaths in this great southern port of\r\nFrance fully equalled that of the populous cities of Italy. In\r\na month the sickness is said to have carried off 57,000 of the\r\ninhabitants of Marseilles and its neighbourhood.[47] One chronicle\r\nsays that \"the Bishop, with the entire chapter of the cathedral,\r\nand nearly all the friars, Preachers and Minorites, together with\r\ntwo-thirds of the inhabitants, perished\" at this time; and adds that\r\nupon the sea might be seen ships, laden with merchandise, driven\r\nabout hither and thither by the waves, the steersman and every sailor\r\nhaving been carried off by the disease.[48] Another, speaking of\r\nMarseilles after the pestilence had passed, says that \"so many died\r\nthat it [p035] remained like an uninhabited place.\"[49] It is of\r\ninterest to record that amongst the survivors there was an English\r\ndoctor, William Grisant, of Merton College, Oxford. He had studied\r\nmedicine at the then celebrated school of Montpellier, and was in\r\npractice at Marseilles during the visitation of the great plague of\r\n1348, dying two years later, in 1350.[50]\r\n\r\nAt Montpellier the ravages were, if possible, even greater. Of\r\nthe twelve magistrates, or consuls, ten died, and in the numerous\r\nmonasteries scarcely one religious was spared. The Dominicans here\r\nwere very numerous, numbering some 140 members, and of these seven\r\nonly are said to have been left alive.[51] Simon de Covino, a doctor,\r\nof Paris, who probably witnessed the course of the disease at\r\nMontpellier, wrote an account of his experiences in a poetical form\r\nin 1350. The moral of his verse is the same as Boccaccio's, and the\r\nchief interest lies in the fact that, like the Italian poet, Covino\r\nwas an eye-witness of what he relates, whilst his medical training\r\nmakes his testimony as to the chief characteristics of the disease\r\nspecially important. The name he gives to the malady is the _pestis\r\ninguinaria_, or bubonic plague of the East. He describes a burning\r\npain, beginning under the arms, or in the groin, and extending to the\r\nregions of the heart. A mortal fever then spread to the vital parts;\r\nthe heart, lungs, and breathing passages were chiefly affected, the\r\nstrength fell quickly, and the person so stricken was unable to fight\r\nany length of time against the poison.\r\n\r\nOne very singular effect of the disease is noted by the author:—\"The\r\npestilence,\" he asserts, \"stamped itself upon [p036] the entire\r\npopulation. Faces became pale, and the doom which threatened the\r\npeople was marked upon their foreheads. It was only necessary to look\r\ninto the countenances of men and women to read there recorded the\r\nblow which was about to fall; a marked pallor announced the approach\r\nof the enemy, and before the fatal day the sentence of death was\r\nwritten unmistakably on the face of the victims. No climate appeared\r\nto have any effect upon the strange malady. It appeared to be stayed\r\nneither by heat nor cold. High and healthy situations were as much\r\nsubject to it as damp and low places. It spread during the colder\r\nseason of winter as rapidly as in the heat of the summer months.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the contagious nature of the epidemic there could be no doubt.\r\n\"It has been proved,\" wrote Covino, \"that when it once entered a\r\nhouse scarcely one of those who dwelt in it escaped.\" The contagion\r\nwas so great that one sick person, so to speak, would \"infect the\r\nwhole world.\" \"A touch, even a breath, was sufficient to transmit\r\nthe malady.\" Those who were obliged to render ordinary assistance to\r\nthe sick fell victims. \"It happened also that priests, those sacred\r\nphysicians of souls, were seized by the plague whilst administering\r\nspiritual aid; and often by a single touch, or a single breath of the\r\nplague-stricken, they perished even before the sick person they had\r\ncome to assist.\" Clothes were justly regarded as infected, and even\r\nthe furniture of houses attacked was suspected. At Montpellier, at\r\nthe time of the visitation, the writer says there were more doctors\r\nthan elsewhere, but hardly one escaped the infection, and this even\r\nalthough it was recognised that medical skill was of little or no\r\navail.\r\n\r\nAccording to the experience of this Montpellier doctor the mortality\r\nwas greatest among the poor, because their hard lives and their\r\npoverty rendered them more susceptible to the deadly infection, and\r\ntheir condition did not enable them to combat it with the chances\r\nof success possessed by the well-to-do classes. As to the extent of\r\n[p037] the mortality, he says \"that the number of those swept away\r\nwas greater than those left alive; cities are now (_i.e._, 1350)\r\ndepopulated, thousands of houses are locked up, thousands stand with\r\ntheir doors wide open, their owners and those who dwelt in them\r\nhaving been swept away.\" Lastly, this writer bears testimony to the\r\nbaneful effect the scourge had upon the morals of those who had been\r\nspared. Such visitations, he thinks, must always exercise the most\r\nlowering influence upon the general virtue of the world.[52]\r\n\r\nFrom Marseilles the epidemic quickly spread northwards up the Rhone\r\nvalley, and in a westerly direction through Languedoc. Montpellier,\r\ntoo, quickly passed on the infection. It commenced at Narbonne in\r\nthe first week of Lent, 1348, and is said to have carried off 30,000\r\nof the inhabitants. Indeed, so fearful was the visitation, that this\r\nancient city is reported never to have recovered from the desolation\r\nit caused.[53]\r\n\r\nAt Arles, which was attacked very shortly after the disease\r\nhad gained a footing on French soil, most of the inhabitants\r\nperished.[54] It reached Avignon as early as January, 1348. In this\r\ncity Pope Clement VI., then in the sixth year of his pontificate,\r\nheld his court. Before the arrival of the dreaded visitant was\r\npublicly recognised sixty-six religious of the convent of Carmelites\r\nhad been carried off, and in the first three days 1,800 people are\r\nreported to have died. In the seven months during which the scourge\r\nlasted the vast roll of the dead in the territory of Avignon had\r\nmounted up to 150,000 persons, amongst whom was the friend of\r\nPetrarch, Laura de Noves, who died on Good Friday, March 27th,\r\n1348.[55] Even in England at the time the excessive mortality at\r\nAvignon [p038] was noted and remarked upon.[56] Great numbers of\r\nJews are said to have been carried off because of the unsanitary\r\nconditions in which they lived, and an equally great number of\r\nSpaniards resident in the city, whose propensity for good living\r\nrendered them most susceptible to the infection.[57]\r\n\r\nThe alarming mortality quickly caused a panic. \"For such terror,\"\r\nwrites an author of the lives of the Popes at Avignon, \"took\r\npossession of nearly everyone, that as soon as the ulcer or boil\r\nappeared on anyone he was deserted by all, no matter how nearly\r\nthey might be related to him. For the father left his son, the son\r\nhis father, on his sick bed. In any house when a person became sick\r\nwith the infirmity and died it generally happened that all others\r\nthere were attacked and quickly followed him to the grave; yea, even\r\nthe animals in the place, such as dogs, cats, cocks, and hens also\r\ndied. Hence those who had strength fled for fear of what had taken\r\nplace, and, as a consequence, many who might otherwise have recovered\r\nperished through want of care. Many, too, who were seized with the\r\nsickness, being considered certain to die and without any hope of\r\nrecovery, were carried off at once to the pit and buried. And in this\r\nway many were buried alive.\"\r\n\r\nThe same writer notices the charity of the Pope at this terrible\r\ntime, in causing doctors to visit and assist the sick poor. \"And\r\nsince the ordinary cemeteries did not suffice to hold the bodies\r\nof the dead, the Pope purchased a large field and caused it to be\r\nconsecrated as a cemetery where anyone might be buried. And here an\r\ninfinite number of people were then interred.\"[58] [p039]\r\n\r\nThe most important and particular account of the pestilence at\r\nAvignon, however, is that of a certain Canon of the Low Countries,\r\nwho wrote at the time from the city to his friends in Bruges. He\r\nwas in the train of a Cardinal on a visit to the Roman Curia when\r\nthe plague broke out. \"The disease,\" he writes, \"is threefold in\r\nits infection; that is to say, firstly, men suffer in their lungs\r\nand breathing, and whoever have these corrupted, or even slightly\r\nattacked, cannot by any means escape nor live beyond two days.\r\nExaminations have been made by doctors in many cities of Italy, and\r\nalso in Avignon, by order of the Pope, in order to discover the\r\norigin of this disease. Many dead bodies have been thus opened and\r\ndissected, and it is found that all who have died thus suddenly have\r\nhad their lungs infected and have spat blood. The contagious nature\r\nof the disease is indeed the most terrible of all the terrors (of the\r\ntime), for when anyone who is infected by it dies, all who see him\r\nin his sickness, or visit him, or do any business with him, or even\r\ncarry him to the grave, quickly follow him thither, and there is no\r\nknown means of protection.\r\n\r\n\"There is another form of the sickness, however, at present running\r\nits course concurrently with the first; that is, certain aposthumes\r\nappear under both arms, and by these also people quickly die. A third\r\nform of the disease—like the two former, running its course at this\r\nsame time with them—is that from which people of both sexes suffer\r\nfrom aposthumes in the groin. This, likewise, is quickly fatal. The\r\nsickness has already grown to such proportions that, from fear of\r\ncontagion, no doctor will visit a sick man, even if the invalid would\r\ngladly give him everything he possessed; neither does a father visit\r\nhis son, nor a mother her daughter, nor a brother his brother, nor\r\na son his father, nor a friend his friend, nor an acquaintance his\r\nacquaintance, nor, in fact, does anyone go to another, no matter\r\nhow closely he may be allied to him by blood, unless he is prepared\r\nto die with him or [p040] quickly to follow after him. Still, a\r\nlarge number of persons have died merely through their affection for\r\nothers; for they might have escaped had they not, moved by piety and\r\nChristian charity, visited the sick at the time.\r\n\r\n\"To put the matter shortly, one-half, or more than a half, of the\r\npeople at Avignon are already dead. Within the walls of the city\r\nthere are now more than 7,000 houses shut up; in these no one is\r\nliving, and all who have inhabited them are departed; the suburbs\r\nhardly contain any people at all. A field near 'Our Lady of Miracles'\r\nhas been bought by the Pope and consecrated as a cemetery. In\r\nthis, from the 13th of March,[59] 11,000 corpses have been buried.\r\nThis number does not include those interred in the cemetery of the\r\nhospital of St. Anthony, in cemeteries belonging to the religious\r\nbodies, and in the many others which exist in Avignon. Nor must I be\r\nsilent about the neighbouring parts, for at Marseilles all the gates\r\nof the city, with the exception of two small ones, are now closed,\r\nfor there four-fifths of the inhabitants are dead.\r\n\r\n\"The like account I can give of all the cities and towns of Provence.\r\nAlready the sickness has crossed the Rhone, and ravaged many cities\r\nand villages as far as Toulouse, and it ever increases in violence\r\nas it proceeds. On account of this great mortality there is such\r\na fear of death that people do not dare even to speak with anyone\r\nwhose relative has died, because it is frequently remarked that in\r\na family where one dies nearly all the relations follow him, and\r\nthis is commonly believed among the people. Neither are the sick now\r\nserved by their kindred, except as dogs would be; food is put near\r\nthe bed for them to eat and drink, and then those still in health fly\r\nand leave the house. When a man dies some rough countrymen, called\r\n_gavoti_, come to the house, and, after receiving a sufficiently\r\nlarge reward, carry the corpse to the grave. Neither relatives\r\nnor friends go to the sick, nor do priests even hear their [p041]\r\nconfessions nor give them the Sacraments; but everyone whilst still\r\nin health looks after himself. It daily happens that some rich man\r\ndying is borne to the grave by these ruffians without lights, and\r\nwithout a soul to follow him, except these hired mourners. When\r\na corpse is carried by all fly through the streets and get into\r\ntheir houses. Nor do these said wretched _gavoti_, strong as they\r\nare, escape; but most of them after a time become infected by this\r\ncontagion and die. All the poor who were wont to receive bread from\r\nthe rich are dead; that is to say, briefly, where daily in ordinary\r\ntimes there were distributed sixty-four measures of wheat for bread,\r\nfifty loaves being made from each measure, now only one measure is\r\ngiven away, and sometimes even a half is found to be sufficient.\r\n\r\n\"And it is said that altogether in three months—that is from January\r\n25th to the present day (April 27th)—62,000 bodies have been buried\r\nin Avignon. The Pope, however, about the middle of March last past,\r\nafter mature deliberation, gave plenary absolution till Easter, as\r\nfar as the keys of the Church extended, to all those who, having\r\nconfessed and being contrite, should happen to die of the sickness.\r\nHe ordered likewise devout processions, singing the Litanies, to be\r\nmade on certain days each week, and to these, it is said, people\r\nsometimes come from the neighbouring districts to the number of\r\n2,000; amongst them many of both sexes are barefooted, some are in\r\nsackcloth, some with ashes, walking with tears and tearing their\r\nhair, and beating themselves with scourges even to the drawing of\r\nblood. The Pope was personally present at some of these processions,\r\nbut they were then within the precincts of his palace. What will\r\nbe the end, or whence all this has had its beginning, God alone\r\nknows. . . .\r\n\r\n\"Some wretched men have been caught with certain dust, and, whether\r\njustly or unjustly God only knows, they are accused of having\r\npoisoned the water, and men in fear do not drink the water from\r\nwells; for this many have been burnt and daily are burnt. [p042]\r\n\r\n\"Fish, even sea fish, is commonly not eaten, as people say they have\r\nbeen infected by the bad air. Moreover, people do not eat, nor even\r\ntouch spices, which have not been kept a year, since they fear they\r\nmay have lately arrived in the aforesaid ships. And, indeed, it has\r\nmany times been observed that those who have eaten these new spices\r\nand even some kinds of sea fish have suddenly been taken ill.\r\n\r\n\"I write this to you, my friends, that you may know the dangers in\r\nwhich we live. And if you desire to preserve yourselves, the best\r\nadvice is to eat and drink temperately, to avoid cold, not to commit\r\nexcess of any kind, and, above all, to converse little with others,\r\nat this time especially, except with the few whose breath is sweet.\r\nBut it is best to remain at home until this epidemic has passed. . . .\r\n\r\n\"Know, also, that the Pope has lately left Avignon, as is reported,\r\nand has gone to the castle called Stella, near Valence on the\r\nRhone, two leagues off, to remain there till times change. The\r\nCuria, however, preferred to remain at Avignon, (but) vacations\r\nhave been proclaimed till the feast of St. Michael. All the\r\nauditors, advocates, and procurators have either left, intend to\r\nleave immediately, or are dead. I am in the hands of God, to whom I\r\ncommend myself. My master will follow the Pope, so they say, and I\r\nwith him, for there are some castles near the airy mountains where\r\nthe mortality has not yet appeared, and it is thought that the best\r\nchance is there. To choose and to do what is best may the Omnipotent\r\nand merciful God grant us all. Amen.\"[60]\r\n\r\nFrom another source some corroboration of the mortality, described by\r\nthe writer of this letter, can be obtained. The 11,000, stated by the\r\nanonymous canon to have been buried in the Pope's new cemetery from\r\nMarch 13th to April 27th may appear excessive; still more, the 62,000\r\nreported to have died in the three months between the [p043] first\r\noutbreak, on January 25th, and the date when the letter was written.\r\nThe statements of the writer are, however, so circumstantial and\r\ngiven with such detail, that, allowing for the tendency in all such\r\ncatastrophes to exaggerate rather than minimise the number of the\r\nvictims, it is probable that his estimate of the terrible destruction\r\nof life at Avignon and in the neighbourhood is substantially\r\naccurate. Writing, as he does, on the Sunday after Easter, 1348, he\r\nevidently points to the time of Lent as the period during which the\r\nepidemic was at its height. This is borne out by a statement in a\r\nGerman chronicle, which says: \"In Venice, in the whole of Italy and\r\nProvence, especially in cities on the sea-coast, there died countless\r\nnumbers. And at Avignon, where the Roman Curia then was, in the first\r\nthree days after mid-Lent Sunday, 1,400 people were computed to have\r\nbeen buried.\"[61] Mid-Lent Sunday, in 1348, fell upon March 30th,\r\nand, consequently, according to this authority, on the last day of\r\nMarch and the first two days of April the death-rate was over 450 a\r\nday.\r\n\r\nNo account of the plague at Avignon would be complete without some\r\nnotice of Gui de Chauliac, and some quotations from the work he has\r\nleft to posterity upon this particular outbreak. De Chauliac was\r\nthe medical attendant of Pope Clement VI. He devoted himself to the\r\nservice of the sick during the time of the epidemic, and, although\r\nhe himself caught the infection, his life was happily spared to the\r\nservice of others, and to enable him to write an account of the\r\nsickness. The mortality, he says, commenced in the month of January,\r\n1348, and lasted for the space of seven months. \"It was of two kinds;\r\nthe first lasted two months, with constant fever and blood-spitting,\r\nand of this people died in three days.\r\n\r\n\"The second lasted for the rest of the time. In this, together with\r\nconstant fever, there were external carbuncles, or buboes, under\r\nthe arm or in the groin, and the [p044] disease ran its course in\r\nfive days. The contagion was so great (especially when there was\r\nblood-spitting) that not only by remaining (with the sick) but even\r\nby looking (at them) people seemed to take it; so much so, that many\r\ndied without any to serve them, and were buried without priests to\r\npray over their graves.\r\n\r\n\"A father did not visit his son, nor the son his father. Charity was\r\ndead. The mortality was so great that it left hardly a fourth part\r\nof the population. Even the doctors did not dare to visit the sick\r\nfrom fear of infection, and when they did visit them they attempted\r\nnothing to heal them, and thus almost all those who were taken\r\nill died, except towards the end of the epidemic, when some few\r\nrecovered.\"\r\n\r\n\"As for me, to avoid infamy, I did not dare to absent myself, but\r\nstill I was in continual fear.\" Towards the end of the sickness de\r\nChauliac took the infection, and was in great danger for six weeks,\r\nbut in the end recovered.[62]\r\n\r\nIt was according to the advice of this same Gui de Chauliac that\r\nPope Clement VI. isolated himself and kept large fires always\r\nalight in his apartments, just as Pope Nicholas IV. had done in a\r\nprevious epidemic. In the whole district of Provence the mortality\r\nappears to have been very great. In the Lent of 1348 no fewer than\r\n358 Dominicans are said to have died.[63] Even by the close of the\r\nNovember of this year the terror of the time had not passed away\r\nfrom Avignon and the Papal Court. Writing to King Louis of Hungary,\r\non the 23rd of that month, the Pope excused himself for not having\r\nsent before, \"as the deadly plague, which has devastated these and\r\nother parts of the world by an unknown and terrible mortality, has\r\nnot only, by God's will, carried off some of our brethren, but caused\r\nothers to fly from the Roman Curia to avoid death.\"[64] [p045]\r\n\r\nIn the early summer of the same year, 1348, just as the plague was\r\nlessening its ravages at Avignon, the Pope addressed a letter to the\r\nGeneral Chapter of the Friars Minor then being held at Verona. He\r\nlaments the misery into which the world has been plunged, chiefly\r\n\"by the mortal sickness which is carrying off from us old and young,\r\nrich and poor, in one common, sudden and unforeseen death.\" He urges\r\nthem to unite in prayer that the plague may cease, and grants special\r\nindulgences \"to such among you as, during this Chapter, or whilst\r\nreturning to your homes, may chance to die.\"[65] Of these Franciscans\r\nit is said that, in Italy alone, 30,000 died in this sickness.\r\n\r\nFrom its first entry into France in the early days of 1348, the\r\nplague was ever spreading far and wide. The letter from Avignon,\r\nalready given, speaks of the ravages of the mortality in the whole\r\nof Provence, and of its having, before the end of April, reached\r\nToulouse on its journey westward. In the August of this year (1348)\r\nBordeaux was apparently suffering from it, since in that month the\r\nPrincess Joan, daughter of Edward III., who was on her way to be\r\nmarried to Pedro, son of the King of Castille, died suddenly in that\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nIn a northerly direction the epidemic spread with equal virulence.\r\nAt Lyons evidence of the pestilence is afforded by an inscription\r\npreserved in the town museum. It relates to the construction of a\r\nchapel in 1352 by a citizen, \"Michael Pancsus,\" in which Mass should\r\nbe said for the souls of several members of his family \"who died in\r\nthe time of the mortality, 1348.\"[66] The anonymous cleric of Bruges,\r\nwho preserved the Avignon letter, writing probably at the time, gives\r\nthe following account of its progress: \"In the year of our Lord 1348,\r\nthat plague, epidemic, and mortality, which we have mentioned before,\r\nby the will of God has [p046] not ceased; but from day to day\r\ngrows and descends upon other parts. For in Burgundy, Normandy, and\r\nelsewhere it has consumed, and is consuming, many thousands of men,\r\nanimals, and sheep.\"[67]\r\n\r\nIt arrived in Normandy probably about the feast of St. James (July\r\n25th), 1348. A contemporary note in a manuscript, which certainly\r\ncame from the Abbey of Foucarmont, gives the following account: \"In\r\nthe year of grace 1348, about the feast of St. James, the great\r\nmortality entered into Normandy. And it came into Gascony, and\r\nPoitou, and Brittany, and then passed into Picardy. And it was so\r\nhorrible that in the towns it attacked more than two-thirds of the\r\npopulation died. And a father did not dare to go and visit his son,\r\nnor a brother his sister, and people could not be found to nurse one\r\nanother, because, when the person breathed the breath of another he\r\ncould not escape. It came to such a pass that no one could be found\r\neven to carry the corpses (to the tomb). People said that the end\r\nof the world had come.\"[68] In another manuscript, M. Delisle has\r\nfound a further note, or portion of a note, referring to the terrible\r\nnature of the malady in Normandy. It never entered a city or town\r\nwithout carrying off the greater part of the inhabitants. \"And in\r\nthat time the mortality was so great among the people of Normandy\r\nthat those in Picardy mocked them.\"[69]\r\n\r\nParis was, of course, visited by the disease. Apparently, it was some\r\ntime in the early summer of 1348 when it first manifested itself.\r\nIn the chronicle of St. Denis it is recorded that \"in the year of\r\ngrace 1348 the said mortality commenced in the Kingdom of France and\r\nlasted about a year and a half, more or less. In this way there died\r\nin Paris, one day with another, 800 persons. . . . In the space of\r\nthe said year and a half, as some declare, the number of the dead\r\nin Paris rose to more than 50,000, and [p047] in the town of St.\r\nDenis the number was as high as 16,000.\"[70] The chronicle of the\r\nCarmelites at Rheims places the total of deaths in Paris at the\r\nlarger number of 80,000,[71] amongst whom were two Queens, Joan of\r\nNavarre, daughter of Louis X., and Joan of Burgundy, wife of King\r\nPhilip of Valois.\r\n\r\nThe most circumstantial account of the plague in France at the time\r\nwhen the capital was attacked is given in the continuation of the\r\nchronicle of William of Nangis, which was written probably before\r\n1368. \"In the same year\" (1348), it says, \"both in Paris in the\r\nkingdom of France, and not less, as is reported, in different parts\r\nof the world, and also in the following year, there was so great\r\na mortality of people of both sexes, and of the young rather than\r\nthe old, that they could hardly be buried. Further they were ill\r\nscarcely more than two or three days, and some often died suddenly,\r\nso that a man to-day in good health, to-morrow was carried a corpse\r\nto the grave. Lumps suddenly appeared under the arm-pits or in\r\nthe groin, and the appearance of these was an infallible sign of\r\ndeath. This sickness, or pestilence, was called by the doctors the\r\nepidemic. And the multitude of people who died in the years 1348 and\r\n1349, was so large that nothing like it was ever heard, read of,\r\nor witnessed in past ages. And the said death and sickness often\r\nsprung from the imagination, or from the society and (consequent)\r\ncontagion of another, for a healthy man visiting one sick hardly\r\never escaped death. So that in many towns, small and great, priests\r\nretired through fear, leaving the administration of the Sacraments to\r\nreligious, who were more bold. Briefly, in many places, there did not\r\nremain two alive out of every twenty.\r\n\r\n\"So great was the mortality in the Hotel-Dieu of Paris that for a\r\nlong time more than fifty corpses were carried [p048] away from it\r\neach day in carts to be buried.[72] And the devout sisters of the\r\nHotel-Dieu, not fearing death, worked piously and humbly, not out of\r\nregard for any worldly honour. A great number of these said sisters\r\nwere very frequently summoned to their reward by death, and rest in\r\npeace with Christ, as is piously believed.\"\r\n\r\nAfter saying that the plague had passed through Gascony and Spain,\r\nthe chronicler speaks of it as going \"from town to town, village\r\nto village, from house to house, and even from person to person;\r\nand coming into the country of France, passed into Germany, where,\r\nhowever, it was less severe than amongst us.\"\r\n\r\n\"It lasted in France,\" the writer says, \"the greater part of 1348\r\nand 1349, and afterwards there were to be seen many towns, country\r\nplaces, and houses in good cities remaining empty and without\r\ninhabitants.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer concludes by declaring that nature soon began to make\r\nup for losses. \"But, alas! the world by this renovation is not\r\nchanged for the better. For people were afterwards more avaricious\r\nand grasping, even when they possessed more of the goods of this\r\nworld, than before. They were more covetous, vexing themselves by\r\ncontentious quarrels, strifes, and law suits.\" Moreover, all things\r\nwere much dearer; furniture, food, merchandise, of all sorts doubled\r\nin price, and servants would work only for higher wages. \"Charity,\r\ntoo, from that time began to grow cold, and wickedness with its\r\nattendant, ignorance, was rampant, and few were found who could or\r\nwould teach children the rudiments of grammar in houses, cities, or\r\nvillages.\"[73] [p049]\r\n\r\nWhilst the plague was at its height King Philip VI. requested the\r\nmedical faculty of Paris to consult together and to report upon the\r\nbest methods by which the deadly nature of the disease could be\r\ncombated. The result of their consultation was published, probably\r\nin June, 1348.[74] Unfortunately, adhering closely to the text of\r\nthe question addressed to them, their reply does not furnish any\r\nhistorical details. They broadly state their views as to the probable\r\norigin of the epidemic, and confine themselves to suggestions as to\r\nits treatment, and to the means by which contagion is to be avoided.\r\nThey are clear as to the infectious nature of the disease, and\r\nearnest in their recommendations that all who were able should have\r\nnothing to do with the sick. \"It is chiefly the people of one house,\r\nand above all those of the same family, who are close together,\" they\r\nsay, \"who die, for they are always near to those who are sick. We\r\nadvise them to depart, for it is in this way that a great number have\r\nbeen infected by the plague.\"[75]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the epidemic was spreading northward. At Amiens, where\r\n17,000 are said to have been carried off by the sickness, it seems\r\nprobable that the malady was not at its height before the summer of\r\nthe following year, 1349. The wave of pestilence from Paris seems to\r\nhave divided. One stream swept on through Normandy towards the coast,\r\nwhich it probably reached, in the regions round Calais, about July\r\nor August of the year 1348. The other stream, checked probably by\r\nthe autumn and winter, made its way more slowly towards Belgium and\r\nHolland.\r\n\r\nIn the June of 1349 the King granted a petition from the Mayor of\r\nAmiens for a new cemetery. In the document the plague in the city\r\nis described as having been then so terrible that the cemeteries\r\nare full, and no more corpses could safely be buried in them.\r\n\"The mortality in the said town,\" says the King's letter, \"is so\r\nmarvellously great [p050] that people are dying there suddenly, as\r\nquickly, as from one evening to the following morning, and often\r\neven quicker than that.\"[76] This was in June, 1349, and already\r\nby September of the same year the authorities were called upon\r\nto deal with a combination of workmen at a tannery to secure for\r\nthemselves excessive wages \"to the great hurt of the people at\r\nlarge.\" The promptness of the action of the Mayor, and the tone of\r\nthe proclamation establishing a rate of wages, is a sufficient proof\r\nthat the crisis was regarded as serious.[77] This trouble at Amiens\r\nis an indication of difficulties which will be seen to have existed\r\nelsewhere in France, in Germany, and in England, which had their\r\norigin in the dearth of labourers after the scourge had passed.\r\n\r\nThe account of the ravages of this great pestilence in France, as\r\nwell as its course in the city of Tournay, where it commenced in\r\nAugust, 1349, is well given in the chronicle of Gilles Li Muisis,\r\nAbbot of St. Martin's, Tournay, who was a contemporary of the events\r\nhe describes. \"It is impossible,\" he says, \"to credit the mortality\r\nthroughout the whole country. Travellers, merchants, pilgrims, and\r\nothers who have passed through it declare that they have found cattle\r\nwandering without herdsmen in fields, towns, and waste lands; that\r\nthey have seen barns and wine-cellars standing wide open, houses\r\nempty, and few people to be found anywhere. So much so that in many\r\ntowns, cities and villages, where there had been before 20,000\r\npeople, scarcely 2,000 are left; and in many cities and country\r\nplaces, where there had been 1,500 people, hardly 100 remain. And in\r\nmany different lands (_multis climatibus_), both lands and fields are\r\nlying uncultivated. I have heard these things from a certain knight\r\nwell skilled in the law, who was one of the members of the Paris\r\nParliament. He was sent, together with a certain Bishop, by Philip,\r\nthe most [p051] illustrious King of France, to the King of Aragon,\r\nand on his return journey passed through Avignon. Both there and in\r\nParis, as he told me, he was informed of the foresaid things by many\r\npeople worthy of credit.\"\r\n\r\nAfter speaking of the evidence given by a pilgrim to Santiago, Li\r\nMuisis proceeds to relate his own experiences in Tournay in the\r\nsummer of 1349. This he does in verse and prose. The poem, after\r\nspeaking of the manifestation of God's anger, describes the plague\r\nbeginning in the East and passing through France into Flanders. Like\r\nother writers, Li Muisis declares that he hesitates to say what he\r\nhas seen and heard, because posterity will hardly credit what he\r\nwould relate.[78] The reports of all travellers and merchants as to\r\nthe terrible state of the country generally give one and the same\r\nsad story of universal death and distress. The particulars as to the\r\nplague in Tournay, the writer's own city, may best be given from his\r\nprose account.\r\n\r\nJohn de Pratis, the Bishop of Tournay, was one of the first to be\r\ncarried off by the sickness. He had gone away for change of air,\r\nand on Corpus Christi Day, June 11th, 1349, he carried the blessed\r\nSacrament in the procession at Arras. He left that city the next\r\nday for Cambray, but died the day after almost suddenly.[79] He was\r\nburied at Tournay; and \"time passed on,\" says our author, to the\r\nbeginning of August, up to which no other person of authority died\r\nin Tournay. But after the feast of St. John the plague began in the\r\nparish of St. Piat, in the quarter of Merdenchor, and afterwards in\r\nother parishes. Every day the bodies of the dead were borne to the\r\nchurches, now five, now ten, now fifteen, and in the parish of St.\r\nBrice sometimes twenty or thirty. In all parish churches the curates,\r\nparish clerks, and sextons to get their fees, [p052] rang morning,\r\nevening, and night the passing bells, and by this the whole people of\r\nthe city, both men and women, began to be filled with fear.\r\n\r\nThe officials of the town consequently seeing that the Dean and\r\nChapter, and the clerics generally, did not care to remedy this\r\nmatter, since it was in their interest it should go on, as they made\r\nprofit out of it, having taken counsel together, issued certain\r\norders. Men and women who, although not married, were living together\r\nas man and wife, were commanded either to marry or forthwith to\r\nseparate. The bodies of the dead were to be buried immediately in\r\ngraves at least six feet deep. There was to be no tolling of any bell\r\nat funerals. The corpse was not to be taken to the church, but at the\r\nservice only a pall was to be spread on the ground, whilst after the\r\nservice there was to be no gathering together at the houses of the\r\ndeceased. Further, all work after noon on Saturdays and during the\r\nentire Sunday was prohibited, as also was the playing of dice and\r\nmaking use of profane oaths.\r\n\r\nThese ordinances having lasted for a time, and the sickness still\r\nfurther increasing, it was proclaimed on St. Matthew's Day (September\r\n24th) that there should be no more ringing of bells, that not more\r\nthan two were to meet for any funeral service, and that no one was\r\nto dress in black. This action of the city authorities, the writer\r\ndeclares to have been most beneficial. In his own knowledge, he\r\nsays, many who had hitherto been living in a state of concubinage\r\nwere married, that the practice of swearing notably diminished, and\r\nthat dice were so little used that the manufacturers turned \"the\r\nsquare-shaped dice\" into \"round objects on which people told their\r\n_Pater Nosters_.\"\r\n\r\nI have tried, says our author, to write what I know, \"and let future\r\ngenerations believe that in Tournay there was a marvellous mortality.\r\nI heard from many about Christmas time who professed to know it as\r\na fact that more than 25,000 persons had died in Tournay, and it\r\nwas strange [p053] that the mortality was especially great among\r\nthe chief people and the rich. Of those who used wine and kept away\r\nfrom the tainted air and visiting the sick few or none died. But\r\nthose visiting and frequenting the houses of the sick either became\r\ngrievously ill or died. Deaths were more numerous about the market\r\nplaces and in poor narrow streets than in broader and more spacious\r\nareas. And whenever one or two people died in any house, at once, or\r\nat least in a short space of time, the rest of the household were\r\ncarried off. So much so, that very often in one home ten or more\r\nended their lives together, and in many houses the dogs and even cats\r\ndied. Hence no one, whether rich, in moderate circumstances, or poor,\r\nwas secure, but everyone from day to day waited on the will of the\r\nLord. And certainly great was the number of curates and chaplains\r\nhearing confessions and administering the Sacraments, and even of\r\nparish clerks visiting the sick with them, who died.\"\r\n\r\nIn the parishes across the river, the mortality was as great as in\r\nTournay itself. Although death as a rule came so suddenly, still the\r\npeople for the most part were able to receive the Sacraments. The\r\nrapidity of the disease, remarked upon by Petrarch and Boccaccio\r\nin Italy, is also spoken of in the same terms by the Abbot of St.\r\nMartin's. People that one had seen apparently well and had spoken to\r\none evening were reported dead next day. He specially remarks upon\r\nthe mortality among the clergy visiting the sick,[80] and speaks of\r\nthe creation of two new cemeteries outside the walls of the town.\r\nOne was in a field near the Leper House _De Valle_, the other at the\r\nreligious house of the Crutched Friars. Strange to say Li Muisis\r\nspeaks of the disfavour with which this necessary precaution of\r\nestablishing new grave-yards was regarded. People, he says, grumbled\r\nbecause they were no longer [p054] allowed to be buried in their own\r\nfamily vaults. The town authorities, however, were firm, and as the\r\npestilence increased deep pits were dug in these two common burying\r\nplaces, and into them numbers of bodies were constantly being thrown\r\nand covered up with a slight layer of earth.[81]\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed by many that the accounts given by contemporary\r\nwriters of the excessive mortality throughout the countries of Europe\r\nmust be greatly exaggerated, and that the population in the middle\r\nof the fourteenth century was not sufficiently large to allow of the\r\nnumber of deaths. On the one hand it is evident that in the majority\r\nof cases the round figures stated can be at most nothing more than\r\na rough approximation of the actual deaths, and that the natural\r\ntendency of those who have witnessed a catastrophe as great and as\r\nuniversal as that of the plague of 1348 and subsequent years, is to\r\nmagnify, rather than to diminish, the disaster. On the other hand,\r\nwhilst allowing that in most cases the actual figures are little\r\nmore than guesses at the truth, and can only be taken as evidence\r\nof the belief of the age in the magnitude of the mortality, it must\r\nbe admitted that Italy, France, and other countries of Europe were\r\nat the time more teeming with population than is perhaps usually\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nM. Siméon Luce has made a special study of the conditions of French\r\npopular life at this period,[82] and the conclusions at which he has\r\narrived may be here usefully stated in brief. It has been proved by\r\nthe labours of French antiquaries that the general population of\r\nFrance before the great pestilence of 1348-1349, and the hundred\r\nyears' war with England, was equal to what it is in the present\r\ncentury. Numerous villages were scattered over the face of the\r\ncountry, every trace of which has now disappeared. The houses, or\r\nrather huts, in which the [p055] population of rural France lived\r\nwere very seldom framed of any kind of masonry, but were for the most\r\npart merely four mud, or clay, walls, and sometimes wickerwork lined,\r\nand the interstices filled in, with hay and straw. As a rule there\r\nwas but one storey, although some, chiefly taverns and places of that\r\nclass, had an upper floor. The roof was thatched or covered with\r\nwood or stone; windows were the exception, and where they did exist\r\nthey were mere slits in the clay walls closed with wooden shutters.\r\nEven the coarse, opaque glass then made was beyond the means of the\r\nordinary peasant and farmer, whilst just about this time even a rich\r\nbourgeois of Paris recommended the filling of windows with waxen\r\ncloth or parchment. The doors were fastened with wooden latches, and\r\nover them, according to the general arrangement, a shutter of wood\r\nwas fixed which was generally left open for air, light, and to allow\r\nthe smoke of the brushwood fire to pass out of the living room. It\r\nwill be readily understood how the condition of life in houses such\r\nas these would not be such as to put much obstacle to the spread of\r\nan epidemic in the rural districts; whilst if such tenements were\r\nvacant even for a short time they would readily fall into decay and\r\nwould present the spectacle of ruin and desolation spoken of by so\r\nmany writers of the period as caused by the great pestilence.\r\n\r\nThe furniture of these houses was simple, but very much what it is\r\nnow in small country houses. The inventories of the period show that\r\nmost houses had vessels of copper, tin and glass, and that there\r\nwere few who did not possess some articles of silver. The people for\r\nthe most part lived on a soup of bread and meal; but even by the\r\nfourteenth century white bread was by no means unknown. The principal\r\nmeat was pork fed in the forests, but most cottages possessed a spit\r\nupon which fowls, previously larded, were occasionally roasted.\r\nOf condiments, mustard was the chief, and it was much, if not\r\nuniversally, used. Even in the humblest houses a cloth would be\r\nspread on [p056] the table at meals. For drink there was the wine\r\nof the country, and in Normandy cider was plentiful. With the drink,\r\nespecially in taverns, which were exceedingly numerous, a little\r\nginger would generally be mixed. In dress fur of various kinds was\r\nmuch used, and, by the time of this pestilence, in France the use of\r\nthe linen shirt as an undergarment had become almost universal. The\r\nsleeping places were dark, airless recesses, in which the people,\r\nhaving divested themselves of all clothing, rested upon straw\r\nmattresses, or sometimes on feather beds. Contrary to the opinion\r\nentertained by persons of repute there is evidence to show that\r\nbathing was common and much used especially among the lower classes,\r\nand that even small villages had their public bath places.\r\n\r\nThis sketch of the epidemic in these regions may be concluded by one\r\nor two instances of the agrarian difficulties which followed upon it.\r\nOn August 16th, 1349, the Emperor Charles IV. issued an order to the\r\ntenants of the Abbey of St. Trond, in the diocese of Liège, to return\r\nto their obedience. The document says that the holders of the Abbey\r\nlands and other dependents are now demanding their own terms and\r\nclaiming liberty to do what they like, with the result that the Abbot\r\nand monastery are so distressed in temporal matters that absolute\r\nruin is impending.[83] The second instance is that of the Abbey of\r\nSt. John at Laon. A document, addressed by the French King Charles\r\nto the Abbot and convent, says that the monastery is so decayed in\r\nrevenues that it is impossible to keep up the fitting and proper\r\nservices of the Church. And although the letter was not written till\r\nnearly the close of the century—1392-3—the cause assigned for this\r\npoverty and decay is \"the great mortality which took place about the\r\nyear 1349,\" by which the tithes and other revenues were destroyed.\r\n\r\nAnd to quote but one more example: \"On 5th July, [p057] 1352, relief\r\nwas granted to the inhabitants of the town of Arras because by reason\r\nof the wars, and because of the mortality which has been universal in\r\nthe world, the said city is so greatly decayed, both as to buildings\r\nand people, as also in revenues and temporal goods, that it is on the\r\nhigh road to (absolute) desolation.\"[84]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[46] Labbe, _Nova Bibliotheca Manuscriptorum_, i, p. 343.\r\n\r\n[47] C.

Inasmuch, however, as the story of the ravages caused\r\nby the disease in England will be told in greater detail, it may\r\nconveniently be left till the last. Here a brief account may be\r\ninterposed of the mortality in other European countries, although it\r\nwill take the reader to the year 1351.\r\n\r\nFrom Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica the plague was carried to the\r\nBalearic Islands. The three streams of infection met with destructive\r\nforce at Majorca. The historian Zurita declares that in less than\r\na month 15,000 persons had perished on the island. Another writer\r\nestimates the total loss of life during the epidemic at double\r\nthat number, and some ancient records have been quoted as stating\r\nthat in the island eight out of every ten people must have died, a\r\nproportion, of course, exaggerated, but sufficient to show local\r\ntradition as to the extent of the misfortune. In the monasteries and\r\nconvents, according to this authority, not one religious was left;\r\nand the Dominicans are said to have been obliged to recruit their\r\nnumbers by enrolling quite young children.[85]\r\n\r\nThe scourge fell upon Spain in the early part of the year 1348. It is\r\nsupposed to have first appeared at Almeira, and in Barcelona whole\r\nquarters of the city were depopulated and rendered desolate by it.\r\nIn May, 1348, it was already raging in Valencia, and by midsummer\r\n300 persons a day are reported to have been buried in the city. At\r\n[p059] Saragossa, where Pedro IV. then was, the malady was at its\r\nheight in September. The people here, as elsewhere, became hardened,\r\nand charity died out in the presence of the terrors of death. They\r\nfled from the sick, leaving them to die alone, and abandoned the\r\ncorpses of the dead in the streets. Most of the cities and villages\r\nof Spain suffered more or less severely, and the sickness appears to\r\nhave lingered longer here than in most other countries. The new Queen\r\nof Aragon had been one of the earliest victims; Alphonsus XI. was one\r\nof the last. In March, 1350, he was laying siege to Gibraltar, when\r\nthe plague broke out suddenly with great violence amongst his troops.\r\nHe refused to retire, as his officers desired him to do, and fell a\r\nvictim to the epidemic on Good Friday, March 26th, 1350.[86]\r\n\r\nAn interesting account of Northern Spain during the plague is given\r\nin the chronicle of Li Muisis, Abbot of St. Martin's, Tournay, from\r\nwhich much was cited in the previous chapter. The writer says that\r\nhe learnt the details from \"a pilgrim, who, in going to St. James'\r\n(of Compostella), passed by Notre Dame de Roc Amadour[87] and by\r\nToulouse, because by reason of the wars he could not travel the\r\nusual way.\" This pilgrim to Compostella, in the middle of the 14th\r\ncentury, would consequently have crossed the Pyrenees by one of\r\nthe passes into Navarre, and so travelled along the north of Spain\r\nto Santiago. Having performed his pilgrimage, Li Muisis informs us\r\nthat he returned through Galicia, and \"with his companion, reached a\r\ntown named Salvaterra,\" probably the place now called Salvatierra,\r\nsituated below the Pyrenees, and just above the Sierra de la Pena.\r\nThis town, as the traveller reported, \"was so depopulated by the\r\nmortality that not one person out of ten had been left alive. The\r\ncity itself was fairly large. The said pilgrim related,\" says Li\r\nMuisis, \"that after supping with the host (who, with two daughters\r\nand [p060] one servant, had alone so far survived of his entire\r\nfamily, and who was not then conscious of any sickness upon him), he\r\nsettled with him for his entertainment, intending to start on his\r\njourney at daybreak, and went to bed. Next morning rising and wanting\r\nsomething from those with whom they had supped, the travellers could\r\nmake no one hear. Then they learnt from an old woman they found in\r\nbed that the host, his two daughters, and servant had died in the\r\nnight. On hearing this the pilgrims made all haste to leave the\r\nplace.\"[88]\r\n\r\nFrom North Italy the pestilence soon spread to the country across the\r\nAdriatic, if indeed it had not already been infected independently,\r\nas seems more than probable, by ships from the East. The port of\r\nRagusa, in Dalmatia, is said to have been attacked as early as\r\nJanuary 13th, 1348, and more than 7,000 are reported as having been\r\nswept away by it. A letter sent in April to the authorities \"condoles\r\nwith them on the terrible mortality, by which the population had been\r\nso greatly diminished.\"[89] At Spalatro, on March 22nd, 1348, the\r\nArchbishop Dominic de Lucaris died of the disease, and it is known\r\nto have raged for some months in the city. An anonymous chronicler\r\nof Spalatro in the 15th century, who professed to take his account\r\nof this period from ancient records, declares that it is impossible\r\nto picture \"the terrors and miseries of these unhappy days.\" To\r\nadd to the horror of the situation, as he declares, wolves and\r\nother wild animals came down from the mountains and fell upon the\r\nplague-stricken city and boldly attacked the survivors. The same\r\nwriter notes the rapidity with which the disease carried off those it\r\nattacked. According to him, when swellings or carbuncles appeared on\r\nany part of the body all hope of saving the life of the patient was\r\nabandoned. As a rule, those stricken in this way died in three or at\r\nmost four days, and so great was the general mortality that bodies\r\nwere left lying unburied [p061] in the streets because there were\r\nnone to carry them to the grave.[90]\r\n\r\nFurther north again, Sebenico, through intercourse with which, very\r\npossibly, the plague was carried into Hungary, was attacked in\r\nthe spring of the same year, 1348. By the 8th of May the Count of\r\nSebenico had written a description of the wretched condition and\r\nstate of the city, by reason of the great mortality in those parts,\r\nthrough which it had been left almost without inhabitants.[91]\r\nIstria, on August 27th, 1348, was declared in a Venetian State paper\r\nto have suffered greatly. The people left, especially in the city\r\nof Pola, were very few, so many having been swept away \"by the late\r\npestilence.\"[92]\r\n\r\nFrom Venice the epidemic spread northwards into Austria and Hungary.\r\nAttacking on its way Padua and Verona, it passed up the valley of the\r\nEtsch and was already at Trent on June 2nd, 1348. Thence it spread\r\nquickly through Botzen up the Brenner Pass, in the Tyrolese Alps,\r\nand was at Muhldorf on the Inn, in Bavaria on June 29th, 1348.[93]\r\nHere it seems to have lasted for a considerable time. One chronicler,\r\nwriting of the subsequent year, 1349, says \"that from the feast of\r\nSt. Michael, 1348, there perished in Muhldorf 1,400 of the better\r\nclass of inhabitants.\"[94] Another, speaking of the plague generally,\r\nsays \"that it raged so terribly in Carinthia, Austria, and Bavaria\r\nthat many cities were depopulated, and in some towns which it visited\r\nmany families were destroyed so completely that not a member was\r\nfound to have survived.\"[95]\r\n\r\nIn November of the same year, 1348, the epidemic is found in Styria,\r\nat Neuberg, in the valley of the Mürz. [p062] The Neuberg Chronicle,\r\ngiving an account of it, says, \"Since this deadly pestilence raged\r\neverywhere, cities became desolate which up to this had been\r\npopulous. Their inhabitants were swept off in such numbers that\r\nsuch as were left, with closed gates, strenuously watched that no\r\none should steal the property of those departed.\" After speaking of\r\nVenice, it continues, \"The pest in its wanderings came to Carinthia,\r\nand then so completely took possession of Styria, that people,\r\nrendered desperate, walked about as if mad.\"\r\n\r\n\"From so many sick pestilential odours proceeded, infecting those\r\nvisiting and serving them, and very frequently it happened that when\r\none died in a house all, one after the other, were carried off. So\r\ncertain was this that no one could be found to stop in the houses of\r\nthe sick, and relations, as if in the natural course of events, seem\r\nto die all together. As a consequence of this overwhelming visitation\r\ncattle were left to wander in the fields without guardians, for no\r\none thought of troubling himself about the future; and wolves coming\r\ndown from the mountains to attack them, against their instincts, and\r\nas if frightened by something unseen, quickly fled into the wilds\r\nagain. Property, too, both moveable and immoveable, which sick people\r\nleave by will, is carefully avoided by all, as if it were sure to be\r\ninfected. The sickness . . . declined about the feast of St. Martin\r\n(November 11th), 1348, and at Neuberg it had carried off many monks\r\nand inhabitants.\"[96]\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to return once again to North Italy, from\r\nwhich another wave of pestilence rolled on to Switzerland. The\r\ncontemporary—but not very accurate—notary of Novara, Peter Azarius,\r\nspeaks to the fact of the plague being at Momo, Gallarete, Varese,\r\nand Bellinzona, on[97] the great highway over the Alps through the\r\nSt. Gothard Pass, and all in the immediate neighbourhood of his\r\nhome. [p063] What Azarius says from personal experience of this\r\nterrible time is of interest. He had left his house at Novara for\r\nfear of the disease, and resting for a while in the town of Tortona,\r\nhe occupied himself in philosophising upon the misfortunes which had\r\nfallen upon Lombardy, and the strange unchristian neglect of the sick\r\nhe could hardly help noticing. \"I have seen,\" he says, \"a rich man\r\nperish, who, even by offering an immense sum of money, could get no\r\none to help him. Through fear of the infection I have seen a father\r\nnot caring for his son, nor a son for his father, nor a brother\r\nfor a brother, nor a friend for his friend, nor a neighbour for\r\nhis neighbour. And what was worse than this, I have seen a family,\r\nalthough one of high position, miserably perish, not being able to\r\nget any help or assistance. Medicine being useless, the strong and\r\nthe young, men and women, were struck down in a moment, and all\r\nthe infected were so shunned that none dared even to enter their\r\nhouses.\"[98]\r\n\r\nFrom the pass of St. Gothard the epidemic passed down the Rhine\r\nValley, and before the close of 1348 was in the neighbourhood\r\nof Dissentis; whilst by May, 1349, the district round about the\r\nmonastery of Pfäffers, half way between the pass of St. Gothard\r\nand Lake Constance, had been attacked. Shortly afterwards the\r\ncountry near the celebrated Abbey of St. Gall was likewise greatly\r\nafflicted.[99]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile another wave of pestilence passed into Switzerland from\r\nthe side of France. Avignon had been attacked, as it has been shown,\r\nin the early part of 1348, and thence the infection was carried up\r\nthe Rhone Valley to the Lake of Geneva. Thence one stream passed in\r\na north-easterly direction over Switzerland, and a second followed\r\nthe course of the river Rhone. By the 17th of March, 1349, the plague\r\nwas at Ruswyl, in the neighbourhood of Lucerne, having passed through\r\nBerne on its way.[100] At Lucerne alone 3,000 people are said to\r\nhave died of the [p064] disease. It must have remained about the\r\nneighbourhood of this lake for some months, for it was not until\r\nSeptember, 1349, that it is known to have manifested its presence\r\nin the high and healthy valley of Engelberg. \"This year (1349),\"\r\nsays the chronicler of the Abbey of Engelberg, \"the pestilence or\r\nmortality was great, and, indeed, most great, in this valley, so that\r\nmore than twenty houses were left empty without an inhabitant. In\r\nthe same year from the feast of Our Lady's nativity, September 8th,\r\nto the feast of the Epiphany 116 of our nuns died in the cloister.\r\nOne of the first to die was the Superior Catherine; about the middle\r\n(of the epidemic) the venerable Mother Beatrix, Countess of Arberg,\r\nformerly Superior; and on the morrow of Holy Innocents, Mechtilde of\r\nWolfenschiessen, the new Superior likewise passed away. And of our\r\nown numbers (there died) two priests and five scholars.\"[101] Basle\r\nwas attacked, and is said to have lost some 14,000 people about the\r\nmiddle of the year; Zurich about September 11th; and Constance some\r\ntime during the winter.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to follow the wanderings of the great mortality in\r\ndetail further through Europe. The annals of almost every country\r\nprove incontestably that most places were in turn visited, and more\r\nor less depopulated, by the epidemic. By April 4th, 1349, it was\r\nreported in Venice that the pestilence was raging in Hungary, and\r\nby June 7th the King could declare \"that by Divine mercy it had now\r\nceased in our kingdom.\" It must consequently have commenced in the\r\ncountry in the early part of the year, although there is evidence\r\nthat it was still to be found in some parts in October of the same\r\nyear. Poland was attacked about the same time as Hungary. Here it is\r\nsaid many of the nobility died. There seemed no help for the daily\r\nmisfortunes. The sickness rendered desolate not alone numberless\r\nhouses, but even towns and villages.[102] [p065]\r\n\r\nIt has been already pointed out that the pestilence had reached\r\nNeuberg, in Styria, by the autumn of the year 1348. It was only the\r\nfollowing year, about the feast of St. John the Baptist, June 24th,\r\n1349, that such a plague as never before was either heard or seen was\r\nraging in Vienna.\r\n\r\nIt commenced seemingly about Easter time, and lasted till St.\r\nMichael's, and a third part of the population was carried off by\r\nit.[103] Each day there died 500 or 600, and one day 960.[104]\r\nThe dead were buried in trenches, each of which, according to one\r\nchronicle, contained some 6,000 corpses. The parish of St. Stephen\r\nlost 54 ecclesiastics during the course of the epidemic, and when it\r\npassed some 70 families were found to be entirely extinct, whilst\r\nthe property of many more had passed into the hands of very distant\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nAnother account declares that in the city and neighbourhood barely a\r\nthird of the population survived. \"Because of the odour, and horror\r\ninspired by the dead bodies, burials in the church cemeteries were\r\nnot allowed; but as soon as life was extinct the corpses were carried\r\nout of the city to a common burial-place (called) 'God's acre.' There\r\nthe deep and broad pits were quickly filled to the top with the dead.\r\nAnd this plague lasted from Pentecost to St. Michael's; and not alone\r\nin Vienna, but in the surrounding country it raged with great fury.\r\nIt spared not the monks and the nuns, for in (the Cistercian Abbey\r\nof) Heiligenkreuz 53 religious at the same time passed out of this\r\nlife.\"[105]\r\n\r\nIn Bohemia the winter cold apparently put a stop to the sickness at\r\nits commencement. \"The mortality commenced to be severe in Bohemia,\r\nbut the recent cold and snow stayed it.\" However, \"in the year 1350\r\nthe plague again [p066] devastated various countries, and then in\r\nBohemia likewise it was to be found.\"[106]\r\n\r\nThe wave of pestilence which passed up the Rhine Valley and attacked\r\nBasle passed on to Colmar, and appeared in Strasburg in July,\r\n1349.[107] At the end of the same year, about December 18th, it had\r\nreached Cologne. \"In the first year of archbishop William von Gennep\r\n(who succeeded to the See of that city on the above date) there\r\nwas,\" says the chronicle, \"a great pestilence in Cologne and its\r\nneighbourhood.\"[108]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the wave had divided lower down the valley of the Rhine,\r\nfor in the summer of 1349 the plague was raging at Frankfort. \"In\r\nthat year,\" writes Caspar Camentz, \"from the feast of St. Mary\r\nMagdalene (June 22nd) to the feast of the Purification following\r\n(February 2nd, 1350) the universal pestilence was at Frankfort. In\r\nthe space of 72 days more than 2,000 people died. Every second hour\r\nthey were buried without bell, priest, or candle. On one day 35 were\r\nburied at one time.\"[109]\r\n\r\nDuring 1349 and 1350 the pestilence was rife in the towns and country\r\nplaces of Prussia. In the latter year it attacked Bremen in the far\r\nnorth, and in the following year the authorities of the city took a\r\ncensus of the numbers that had been carried off by it. \"In the year\r\nof our Lord 1350,\" the account says, \"the plague had gone round the\r\nworld and had visited Bremen, and the Council determined to take the\r\nnumber of the dead, and it was found that of known and named people\r\nthere were (entered on the list) in the parish of St. Mary 1,816;\r\nin that of St. Martin, 1,415; in St. Anschar's, 1,922; and in St.\r\nStephen's, 1,813; moreover, numberless people had died in the fields\r\nbeyond [p067] the walls and in cemeteries, the number of whom, as\r\nknown and described, reached almost 7,000.\"[110]\r\n\r\nFrom Flanders, where the pestilence was at Tournay in December, 1349,\r\nas before reported, the epidemic spread into Holland. Here in the\r\nfollowing year its progress was marked by the same great mortality,\r\nespecially among those who lived together in monasteries and\r\nconvents. \"At this time,\" writes the chronicler, \"the plague raged\r\nin Holland as furiously as has ever been seen. People died walking\r\nin the streets. In the Monastery of Fleurchamps 80 died, including\r\nmonks and lay brethren. In the Abbey of Foswert, which was a double\r\nmonastery for men and women, 207 died, including monks, nuns, lay\r\nbrethren, and lay sisters.\"[111]\r\n\r\nThis brief review of the progress of the plague in Europe will be\r\nsufficient to show that the mortality and consequent distress were\r\nuniversal. The northern countries of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden\r\nreceived the infection from England. As will be seen subsequently,\r\nthe northern parts of England were troubled with the epidemic in\r\nthe late summer and autumn of 1349, and either from a port on the\r\neastern coast, or from London, the plague was brought over in a ship.\r\nLagerbring, a Swedish historian of repute, says that a ship with a\r\ncargo of woollen cloth sailed out of the port of London early in the\r\nsummer of 1349.[112] The plague had been very great in the English\r\ncapital, and all the crew died whilst the ship was at sea. Driven\r\nabout by the winds and currents the fatal bark was cast on the shore\r\nat Bergen, in Norway. The epidemic spread quickly over the entire\r\ncountry. The Archbishop of Drontheim and all his Chapter, with one\r\nsingle exception, died, and the survivor was nominated Archbishop.\r\nMost of his suffragans were also carried [p068] off.[113] Several\r\nfamilies who had fled from Bergen to avoid the infection died in the\r\nmountains to which they had retired.\r\n\r\nAnother Swedish historian states that in the country of West-Gotland\r\nalone 466 priests were swept away by the plague. In that district\r\nthen there were about 479 churches, many of which were served by\r\nmore than one priest, so that the number given may not be altogether\r\nimprobable.[114] It is stated that in Norway there long existed what\r\nwere called _Find-dale_—wildernesses—in which were unmistakable\r\ntraces of cultivation, and after the plague there is evidence of a\r\nstate of exhaustion and a dearth of inhabitants, which lasted for\r\nseveral generations, so that forests grew where there had once been\r\nchurches and villages.\r\n\r\nSome interesting particulars may be gathered about the town of Wisby,\r\non the Isle of Gotland. The annals of the Franciscan convent note\r\nthat the plague raged in 1350. In the necrology of the same house\r\nare entered the names of a great number of friars and many novices\r\nwho died in this fatal year, and the comparison of one portion of\r\nthe necrology with another, in which the names are collected into\r\ngroups, shows that the worst time at Wisby was in July, August,\r\nand September, 1350.[115] In all twenty-four friars, a very large\r\nproportion of the convent, appear to have been carried off by the\r\nepidemic. In [p069] the Cathedral of Wisby five sepulchral slabs are\r\nstill preserved with the date 1350, whilst of such memorials as have\r\nescaped destruction not more than a single one remains for any other\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe King of Sweden, Magnus II., in 1350 addressed letters patent\r\nto his people, wherein he says that \"God for the sins of man has\r\nstruck the world with this great punishment of sudden death. By it\r\nmost of the people in the land to the west of our country (_i.e._,\r\nNorway) are dead. It is now ravaging in Norway and Holland, and is\r\napproaching our kingdom of Sweden.\" The king therefore summons them\r\nto abstain on every Friday from all food but bread and water, or \"at\r\nmost to take only bread and ale,\" to walk with bare feet to their\r\nparish churches, and to go in procession round about the cemeteries\r\nattached to them, carrying with them the holy relics.\r\n\r\nIn the capital of Sweden, when the plague burst upon the country, it\r\nis recorded that \"the streets were strewn with corpses,\" and among\r\nthe victims are named Hacon and Knut, two brothers of the king.\r\n\r\nDenmark and Sleswig Holstein suffered from the pestilence at the same\r\ntime as Norway and Sweden. In one chronicle it is called \"a most\r\ngrievous plague of buboes;\" in another it is recorded that in the\r\nyear 1350 \"a great plague and sudden death raged both in the case of\r\nmen and in that of cattle.\"[116] The accounts of the Bishopric of\r\nRoskild, on the Isle of Zealand, about the year 1370, or twenty years\r\nafter this plague had passed, show the state of universal desolation\r\nto which the country was reduced. Lands are described as lying idle\r\nand uncultivated, villages and houses desolate and uninhabited.\r\nProperty that formerly used to bring in four marks, or 48 \"pund,\" now\r\nproduced only 18 \"pund.\" The same story is repeated on almost every\r\npage throughout these long accounts.[117]\r\n\r\nA few words only need now be said of the desolation [p070] which\r\neverywhere throughout Europe was naturally the consequence of the\r\ngreat pestilence. Of North Italy John of Parma writes that \"at the\r\ntime (1348) labourers could not be got, and the harvest remained\r\non the fields, since there was none to gather it in.\"[118] Twenty\r\nyears after the pestilence, in 1372, it is said of Mayence that\r\n\"it is indubitable and notorious that because of the terrible\r\ncharacter of the pestilence and mortality which suddenly swept away\r\nlabourers, copyholders (_parciarios_) and farmers, even the most\r\nrobust, labourers are to-day few and rare, for which reason many\r\nfields remain uncultivated and deserted.\"[119] Again, in 1359, Henry,\r\nBishop of Constance, impropriated to the monastery of St. Gall, in\r\nSwitzerland, the Church of Marbach and others, to enable the abbey\r\n\"to keep up its hospitality, bestow alms, and fulfil its other\r\nduties,\" and he assigns as a reason why it cannot now do this \"that\r\nby the epidemic or mortality of people, which by permission of God\r\nhas existed in these parts, the number of farmers and other retainers\r\nof both sexes of this abbey, belonging by law of service to the said\r\nmonastery, which has passed from this life to the Lord (has been so\r\ngreat) that many of the possessions of this monastery have remained,\r\non account of the said death, uncultivated, and no proper return\r\ncomes from them.\"[120]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[85] Phillippe, _Histoire de la Peste Noire_, p. 54.\r\n\r\n[86] _Ibid._, pp. 54-56.\r\n\r\n[87] This was a place of pilgrimage on the Amadour, not far from\r\nToulouse.\r\n\r\n[88] _Chronicon majus Ægidii Li Muisis_, ii, 280.\r\n\r\n[89] Lechner, _Das grosse Sterben in Deutschland_, p. 21.\r\n\r\n[90] Farlati, _Illyricum Sacrum_, iii, p. 324.\r\n\r\n[91] Lechner, _ut sup._, p. 22.\r\n\r\n[92] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[93] _Ibid._, p. 23.\r\n\r\n[94] _Annales Matscenses_ in _Mon.

It has\r\nalready been pointed out that Northern France was suffering under the\r\nscourge in the summer of that year, and that in August the pestilence\r\nhad visited Normandy and was found at Calais, then in possession of\r\nthe English. Probably, also, at this time, Jersey and Guernsey, with\r\nwhich England was in constant communication, were decimated by the\r\ndisease. So greatly did these islands suffer that the King's taxes,\r\nusually raised upon the fishing industries, could not be levied. \"By\r\nreason,\" writes the English King to John Mautravers, the Governor,\r\n\"of the mortality among the people and fishing folk of these islands,\r\nwhich here as elsewhere has been so great, our rent for the fishing,\r\nwhich has been yearly paid us, cannot be now obtained without the\r\nimpoverishing and excessive oppression of those fishermen still\r\nleft.\"[121]\r\n\r\nRumours of the coming scourge reached England in the early summer. On\r\nAugust 17th, 1348, the Bishop of Bath and Wells, Ralph of Shrewsbury,\r\nsent letters through his diocese ordering \"processions and stations\r\nevery Friday, in each collegiate, regular, and parish church, to beg\r\nGod to protect the people from the pestilence which had come from the\r\nEast into the neighbouring kingdom,\" and granting an indulgence of\r\nforty days to all who, being in a state of grace, should give alms,\r\nfast or pray, in order, if possible, to avert God's anger.[122]\r\n\r\nThe \"neighbouring kingdom\" spoken of by the Bishop [p072] in his\r\nletter may be taken almost certainly to refer to France. From\r\nCalais it is probable that the pestilence was brought into England\r\nin certain ships conveying some who were anxious to escape from\r\nit. Most of the contemporary accounts agree in naming the coast of\r\nDorsetshire as the part first infected. Thus Galfrid le Baker, a\r\ncontemporary, says \"it came first to a seaport in Dorsetshire, and\r\nthen into the country, which it almost deprived of inhabitants, and\r\nfrom thence it passed into Devon and Somerset to Bristol.\"[123] Two\r\nor three of the chronicles, also, more particular than the rest, name\r\nMelcombe Regis as the memorable spot where the epidemic first showed\r\nitself in England. \"In the year of our Lord 1348, about the feast\r\nof the Translation of St. Thomas (July 7th),\" writes the author of\r\nthe chronicle known as the _Eulogium Historiarum_, who was a monk\r\nof Malmesbury at this time, \"the cruel pestilence, terrible to all\r\nfuture ages, came from parts over the sea to the south coast of\r\nEngland, into a port called Melcombe, in Dorsetshire. This (plague)\r\nsweeping over the southern districts, destroyed numberless people\r\nin Dorset, Devon, and Somerset.\"[124] So, too, a continuation of\r\nTrivet's chronicle, taken down to the death of Edward III. by a\r\ncanon of Bridlington, who was thus probably a contemporary of the\r\nevent, says that \"the great plague came into England to the southern\r\ndistricts, beginning by some (ships) putting in from the sea into a\r\ntown called Melcombe.\"[125]\r\n\r\nMelcombe Regis, or Weymouth, was at that time a port of considerable\r\nimportance. In 1347-8, for example, it furnished Edward III., for his\r\nsiege of Calais, with 20 ships and 264 mariners; whilst Bristol sent\r\nonly 22 ships and 608 sailors, and even London but 25 boats and 662\r\nmen.[126] [p073] This fact is of interest, not merely as showing the\r\nimportance of Melcombe Regis as a port on the southern coast, but\r\nas evidence actually connecting the place at this very period with\r\nCalais, and, doubtless, with other coast towns of France. It is not\r\nat all improbable that by the return of some of the Melcombe boats\r\nfrom Calais, the epidemic may have been conveyed into the town. No\r\nevidence is known to exist as to the mortality in the port itself;\r\nbut an item of information as to the effect of the disease in the\r\nneighbourhood is afforded at a subsequent period. Three years after\r\nthe plague had passed the King, by his letters patent, forbade any\r\nof the inhabitants of the island of Portland to leave their homes\r\nthere, or, indeed, to sell any of their crops out of the district,\r\n\"because,\" he says, \"as we have learnt, the island of Portland, in\r\nthe county of Dorset, has been so depopulated in the time of the\r\nlate pestilence that the inhabitants remaining are not sufficiently\r\nnumerous to protect it against our foreign enemies.\"[127]\r\n\r\nThe actual date when the pestilence first showed itself in\r\nDorsetshire has been considered somewhat doubtful. The earliest day\r\nsuggested is that assigned by the monk of Malmesbury in his _Eulogium\r\nHistoriarum_, who names July 7th (1348) as the time when it commenced\r\nat Melcombe Regis. The latest date is that given by Knighton, the\r\nsub-contemporary canon of Leicester, who mentions generally that it\r\nbegan in the autumn of the year 1348. One chronicle gives July 25th,\r\nand two others August 1st, whilst another merely names August as the\r\nmonth. Under these circumstances, and in view of the fact that its\r\narrival in England was apparently unknown to the Bishop of Bath and\r\nWells, who was then in his diocese, in the middle of August, it seems\r\nmore than likely that the terrible scourge did not make itself felt\r\nin the West of England until after the middle of that month and not\r\nlater than its end. [p074]\r\n\r\nThe early commencement of the disease is borne out by a document\r\nin the archives of the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury. Archbishop\r\nStrafford died on St. Bartholomew's Eve, August 23rd, 1348, and\r\nbefore the end of September the Prior of Canterbury, acting with\r\narchiepiscopal power during the vacancy, addressed a mandate to\r\nthe Bishop of London, as the Dean of the College of Bishops, to\r\nissue directions to the suffragans of Canterbury to hold public\r\nprocessions in their respective dioceses to pray God's aid against\r\n\"the mortality\" which was already assuming alarming proportions.[128]\r\n\r\nThe summer and autumn of 1348 were abnormally wet in England, and\r\nthe chronicles record that from St. John the Baptist's Day (June\r\n24th) to Christmas it rained either by night or by day with hardly an\r\nexception. In such a season, naturally unhealthy, the sickness, of\r\nits own nature most deadly, found every condition suitable for its\r\nrapid development.\r\n\r\nStarting from Melcombe Regis, the wave of contagion spread itself\r\nvery quickly over Dorset, Devon, and Somerset, with the other\r\ncounties comprised in the dioceses of Salisbury, Exeter, and Wells.\r\n\"It passed,\" writes Robert of Avesbury, the contemporary Registrar\r\nof the Court of Canterbury, \"most rapidly from place to place,\r\nswiftly killing ere mid-day many who in the morning had been well,\r\nand without respect of persons (some few rich people excepted), not\r\npermitting those destined to die to live more than three, or at most\r\nfour, days. On the same day twenty, forty, sixty, and very often more\r\ncorpses were committed to the same grave.\"[129] In fact, over the\r\nWest of England during the late autumn of 1348 and the first months\r\nof the following year the words of the old play must have had only\r\ntoo true an application—\r\n\r\n \"One news straight came huddling on another\r\n   Of death, and death, and death.\" [p075]\r\n\r\nIn dealing with a case of this kind a first object is to control\r\nas far as possible, by means of definite statistics, the general\r\nand vague statements of chroniclers and other contemporary writers;\r\nwhilst in the absence of such statistics lies one of the great\r\ndifficulties in dealing with the history of the Middle Ages. Owing\r\npartly to the troublesome and intricate nature of the subject, as\r\nwell as to the poverty of the material and the inherent dryness of\r\nsuch matters, modern writers have made little advance to a more\r\ncorrect knowledge of the population of European countries in those\r\nages. Much, however, might be done. As usual, the ecclesiastical\r\ndocuments form the surest basis for any calculation, and the\r\nepiscopal registers enable us to arrive at actual numbers.\r\nAccordingly, in the present inquiry, these registers are of the\r\nhighest importance, and it is necessary constantly to recur to them,\r\nas they furnish the only means of arriving at any adequate knowledge\r\nof the proportion of the population swept away by the plague.\r\nPossibly the mortality may have been greater among ecclesiastics than\r\namong lay persons; but only from the number of the clergy carried\r\noff by the epidemic can an estimate be formed as to the number of\r\nlay people who died. Accordingly, in the course of this work, the\r\nmortality of the clergy is systematically investigated.\r\n\r\nTo understand the nature and value of the evidence thus afforded\r\nas to the extent of the mortality, a few words of explanation are\r\nnecessary. In each diocese there was kept by the Bishop's Registrar a\r\nlist of all the institutions made to vacant benefices by the Bishop.\r\nAs a rule, not only was the name of the place and of the out-going\r\nand the incoming incumbent, together with the date expressed, but\r\nthe reason of the vacancy was stated, whether arising from death,\r\nexchange, or resignation. These lists, then, for the fatal period, or\r\nthe autumn of 1348 and the year 1349, afford some means of gauging\r\nthe extent of the mortality among the clergy. It must, however, be\r\nborne in mind that these registers record only the institutions of\r\nthe actual [p076] incumbents, and take no account of the larger\r\nbody of curates and chaplains, to say nothing of the monks, canons,\r\nand friars of a diocese. It has been calculated by a recent writer\r\nthat non-beneficed clergy more than equal in numbers the holders of\r\nbenefices, and that the total number of institutions of a diocese may\r\nfairly be doubled in estimating the deaths of the clergy during this\r\nepidemic.[130] These Books of Institutions, moreover, by furnishing\r\nthe dates of the appointments made to various livings, afford a means\r\nof determining, at least approximately, the time when the plague was\r\nrife in a district, and even, making allowances for any delay in\r\nfilling up the benefice, in any given place.\r\n\r\nBesides the special register of each diocese a series of official\r\nstate documents, called the _Patent Rolls_, contains much evidence of\r\nthe destructive powers of the disease. On these rolls, amongst every\r\nvariety of public document, are entered royal grants, licenses, and\r\npresentations made by the Sovereign to such vacant ecclesiastical\r\nlivings as were at the time in the royal gift. These were ordinarily—\r\n\r\n(1) Benefices of which the King was by right the patron.\r\n\r\n(2) Those to which he presented, as guardian of the sons of tenants\r\n_in capite_ during their minority, and\r\n\r\n(3) Livings to which bishops and abbots of sees and monasteries, then\r\nvacant, ordinarily presented. At this period, 1348-9, moreover, the\r\nroyal presentations were largely augmented by the patronage attached\r\nto the alien religious houses existing in England, the possession of\r\nwhich, \"by reason of his war with France,\" as the official phrase\r\nruns, \"the King had seized into his own hands.\"\r\n\r\nThe evidence of the mortality among the beneficed clergy during the\r\ngreat pestilence, as witnessed by the entries on the patent rolls,\r\nmay be here briefly summarised. In 1348, in the period from January\r\nto May, the King presented to [p077] 42 livings, and to 36 during\r\nthe following four months; so that in the eight months, immediately\r\nbefore the arrival of the plague in England, the average number of\r\npresentations monthly was below ten, the previous _yearly_ average\r\nbeing hardly more than a hundred. The roll, upon which are entered\r\nthe grants and presentations from September to the close of the\r\nyear, affords conclusive proof that in the last four months of the\r\nyear 1348 death had been busy among those holding royal preferments.\r\nEighty-one more livings had to be filled up by the Sovereign during\r\nthat period.\r\n\r\nThe patents for 1349, in the same way, occupy three parts, or rolls.\r\nOn the first part are enrolled the presentations from January 25th\r\nto the end of May. This large roll is a curiosity, since a very\r\ngreat part of the parchment record is devoted to the entry of\r\nRoyal presentations to the vacant livings, no fewer than 249 being\r\nrecorded, as against 42 during the same period of the previous year.\r\nThe second part registers the livings filled by King Edward from\r\nJune to the middle of September, 1349, when the number reaches the\r\nextraordinary figure of 440, as against 36 in the corresponding\r\nperiod of 1348.\r\n\r\nThe third period, ending on January 24th, 1350, shows a decline in\r\nthe number, although it still stands at the considerable total of\r\n205. Altogether, therefore, from January 25th, 1349, to the same date\r\nin 1350, the King alone presented to 894 livings, which had become\r\nvacant. Comparing the figures thus obtained with the normal period\r\nof 1348 it may be said roughly that out of the 1,053 presentations,\r\nmade by King Edward in the two years, at least 800 must have been due\r\nto the mortality caused by the great plague. This will be seen to\r\nbe sufficiently terrible when it is remembered that, even allowing\r\nfor the large number of presentations then in the hands of the King,\r\nthey would form but a very small portion of the total number of\r\ninstitutions to vacant livings at this period.\r\n\r\nThe whole question of statistics in their details, as also [p078]\r\nany special indications of the effects which followed upon the\r\nravages of the plague, will be dealt with in subsequent chapters in\r\norder to interfere as little as possible with the consecutive story\r\nof the visitation itself. Among the presentations made by the King,\r\nin the autumn of this year, frequent mention is made of vacancies in\r\nthe diocese of Sarum, in which the county of Dorset is situated. From\r\nOctober 8th, 1348, to January 10th, 1349—that is, in the space of\r\nthree months—the Crown presented to no fewer than 30 livings in the\r\ndiocese. Most of these were in the county of Dorset, and Abbotsbury\r\nAbbey, apparently the first monastery attacked, and Bincombe rectory,\r\nto which Edward III. presented on October 8th, 1348, were both close\r\nto Melcombe Regis, where the plague commenced its ravages.\r\n\r\nJudged merely by the few royal presentations it is curious to observe\r\nhow closely the epidemic in this country clung to the rivers and\r\nwater-courses. The neighbourhood of Blandford, for instance, must\r\nhave suffered severely enough during the November and December\r\nof 1348, the two Winterbournes and Spettisbury, together with\r\nBlandford—all four close on the river Stour—losing their incumbents.\r\nTo Spettisbury, indeed, the King presented thrice in a very short\r\nspace of time. Even before John le Spencer, of Grimsby, to whom the\r\nliving was granted on December 7th, could have been installed in his\r\ncure—in fact, probably even before the grant was made—he was dead,\r\nfor on December 10th, only three days later, another letter patent\r\nis issued, upon the death of Spencer, to Adam de Carleton. Adam in\r\nhis turn did not hold the benefice long, and on January 4th, 1349,\r\nRobert de Hoveden was appointed in his place. Nor are these the only\r\ninstances, even among the few presentations recorded on the patent\r\nrolls, of Dorset incumbents following one another in rapid succession\r\nduring the last months of 1348.\r\n\r\nLooking at the number of institutions in each month of this period,\r\nand making due allowance for the fact that the [p079] vacancy had\r\nprobably occurred some little time before it was filled up, it is\r\nevident that the epidemic was prevalent in the county of Dorset from\r\nOctober, 1348, to February, 1349, and the mortality was highest in\r\nDecember and January.[131] The existence of the epidemic begins to\r\nbe manifest in the institutions for October, 1348. Previously only\r\ntwelve institutions are recorded during that year. West Chickerell,\r\na place close to Weymouth, received a new incumbent on October 14th,\r\nwhilst to Bincombe, close by, which was then vacant, as is proved by\r\nthe King's presentation on the 8th of the month, no new incumbent\r\nwas inducted till November 4th. Warmwell and Combe Kaynes, a little\r\nto the eastward, received new parish priests on October the 9th and\r\n19th, and Dorchester, the capital, was attacked apparently about the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\nFollowing the indications afforded by the Bishop's registers the\r\nravages of the pestilence are apparent on the coast early in\r\nNovember, when many vacancies begin to be noted in the coast towns.\r\nBridport, East Lulworth, Tynham, Langton, and Wareham had all been\r\nvisited by this time, whilst before the end of the month the epidemic\r\nhad crossed the county and appeared at Shaftesbury. On December 3rd\r\ntwo vicarages in the south, quite close together, Abbotsbury and\r\nPortesham, received new incumbents.\r\n\r\nAt Shaftesbury appointments were made to St. Laurence's on the 29th\r\nof November, to St. Martin's on the 10th of December, to St. John's\r\non the 6th of January, 1349, and to [p080] St. Laurence's again on\r\nthe 12th of May. At Wareham, the small alien priory became vacant\r\nbefore November 4th, for on that day the King appointed a successor\r\nto Michael de Molis, lately dead,[132] and appointments were made\r\nto St. Martin's, Wareham, on the 8th of December, to St. Peter's\r\non the 22nd of December, to St. John's on the 29th of May, and to\r\nSt. Michael's on the 17th of June. Three changes were registered as\r\nhaving taken place at Winterbourne St. Nicholas, between December\r\n27th and May 3rd. As far as can be judged by the dates of these\r\ninstitutions it would appear as if a fresh outbreak of peculiar\r\nviolence occurred towards the end of April.\r\n\r\nThe Bridport Corporation records show that four bailiffs held\r\noffice in 1349, in place of the usual two, on account of the\r\npestilence.[133] In common with most places in the land, Poole, which\r\nwas then of sufficient importance to be called upon to furnish four\r\nships and 94 men for the siege of Calais, suffered greatly from the\r\npestilence, and received a considerable check to its prosperity. \"At\r\nPoole,\" writes Hutchins, \"a spot on the projecting slip of land,\r\nknown as the _Baiter_, is still pointed out as the burial-place of\r\nits victims.\"[134] And the same writer adds that the country did not\r\nentirely recover for the next 150 years; since, in the reign of Henry\r\nVIII., \"Poole and other towns in Dorsetshire\" were included in that\r\nnumerous list of places whose desolated buildings were ordered to be\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nBefore the close of the year 1348 the pestilence had spread itself\r\nfar and wide in the western counties of England. The diocese of Bath\r\nand Wells, and that of Exeter, the former conterminous with the\r\ncounty of Somerset, and the latter comprising those of Devon and\r\nCornwall, were infected in the late autumn of that year, and all over\r\nthe west, as the old chronicle relates, the sickness \"most pitifully\r\ndestroyed people innumerable.\" [p081]\r\n\r\nIndeed, so terrible had been the effect of the scourge among the\r\nclergy of Somerset that, as early as January 17th, 1349, the Bishop\r\nof Bath and Wells felt himself constrained to address a letter of\r\nadvice to his flock. The document is of such interest, both as\r\nevidence of the straits to which at that early date the diocese had\r\nbeen reduced by the excessive mortality, and for the advice that it\r\ncontains, that it is here quoted at considerable length, since it\r\nproves the depth of degradation to which the whole religious life was\r\nreduced by the terror inspired by the disease. Every bond was loosed,\r\nand every ordinary ecclesiastical regulation and provision set aside,\r\nbecause none could now be enforced, or, indeed, observed. \"The\r\ncontagious nature of the present pestilence, which is ever spreading\r\nitself far and wide,\" writes the Bishop, \"has left many parish\r\nchurches and other cures, and consequently the people of our diocese,\r\ndestitute of curates[135] and priests. And inasmuch as priests cannot\r\nbe found who are willing out of zeal, devotion, or for a stipend to\r\nundertake the care of the foresaid places, and to visit the sick\r\nand administer to them the Sacraments of the Church (perchance for\r\ndread of the infection and contagion), many, as we understand, are\r\ndying without the Sacrament of Penance. These, too, are ignorant\r\nof what ought to be done in such necessity, and believe that no\r\nconfession of their sins, even in a case of such need, is useful or\r\nmeritorious, unless made to a priest having the keys of the Church.\r\nTherefore, desiring, as we are bound to do, the salvation of souls,\r\nand ever watching to bring back the wandering from the crooked paths\r\nof error, we, on the obedience you have sworn to us, urgently enjoin\r\nupon you and command you—rectors, vicars, and parish priests—in all\r\nyour churches, and you deans, in such places of your deaneries as\r\nare destitute of the consolation of priests, that you at once and\r\npublicly instruct and induce, yourselves or by some other, all who\r\nare sick of the present [p082] malady, or who shall happen to be\r\ntaken ill, that _in articulo mortis_, if they are not able to obtain\r\nany priest, they should make confession of their sins (according to\r\nthe teaching of the apostle) even to a layman, and, if a man is not\r\nat hand, then to a woman. We exhort you, by the present letters, in\r\nthe bowels of Jesus Christ, to do this, and to proclaim publicly\r\nin the aforesaid places that such confession made to a layman in\r\nthe presumed case can be most salutary and profitable to them for\r\nthe remission of their sins, according to the teaching and the\r\nsacred canons of the Church. And for fear any, imagining that these\r\nlay confessors may make known confessions so made to them, shall\r\nhesitate thus to confess in case of necessity, we make known to all\r\nin general, and to those in particular who have already heard these\r\nconfessions, or who may in future hear them, that they are bound by\r\nthe precepts of the Church to conceal and keep them secret; and that,\r\nby a decree of the sacred canons, they are forbidden to betray such\r\nconfession by word, sign, and by any other means whatever, unless\r\nthose confessing so desire. And (further) should they do otherwise,\r\nlet such betrayers know that they sin most gravely, and incur the\r\nindignation of Almighty God and of the whole Church.\" And further to\r\nstir up the zeal of both clergy and laity to this work the Bishop\r\ngrants ample indulgences to such as follow the advice here given them.\r\n\r\n\"And since late repentance,\" he says \"(when, for example, sickness\r\ncompels and the fear of punishment terrifies) often deceives many,\r\nwe grant to all our subjects, who in the time of the pestilence\r\nshall come to confession to priests having the keys of the Church\r\nand power to bind and to loose, before they are taken sick, and who\r\ndo not delay till the day of necessity, forty days of indulgence.\r\nTo every priest also who shall induce people to do this, and hear\r\nthe confessions of those thus brought to confess whilst in health,\r\nwe grant the same by the mercy of God Almighty, and trusting to the\r\nmerits and prayers of [p083] his glorious Mother, of the Blessed\r\nPeter, Paul, and Andrew the Apostles, our patrons, and of all the\r\nSaints.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall further declare,\" he adds, \"to all thus confessing to lay\r\npeople in case of necessity, that if they recover they are bound to\r\nconfess the same sins again to their own parish priest. The Sacrament\r\nof the Eucharist, when no priest can be obtained, may be administered\r\nby a deacon. If, however, there be no priest to administer the\r\nSacrament of Extreme Unction, faith must, as in other matters,\r\nsuffice for the Sacrament.\"[136]\r\n\r\nThese large derogations from the usual ecclesiastical practice,\r\nthough consonant alike with Christian charity and the teaching of\r\nthe Church, are resorted to only in cases of the direst need, and\r\nthe circular letter of the Bishop of Bath and Wells witnesses to the\r\nextreme gravity of the situation throughout the diocese, as early as\r\nthe month of January, 1349. Already, as is certain from the Bishop's\r\nwords, the dearth of clergy had made itself felt, and people were\r\ndying in the county of Somerset without the possibility of obtaining\r\nspiritual aid in their last hours, and no priests could be found\r\nto take the places of those who had already fallen victims to the\r\ndisease. The list of institutions given in the register of Bishop\r\nRalph of Shrewsbury shows that the mortality in that county was\r\nconsiderable as early as the November of the previous year, 1348.\r\n\r\nTaking the institutions of the diocese as a guide to the time when\r\nthe plague was most violent, and bearing in mind that the death\r\nwould have occurred some little time before the institution, and\r\nthat according to the Bishop's letter some delay had been inevitable\r\nin the filling up of benefices, the months when the pestilence\r\nwas at its height in the county of Somerset would appear to be\r\nDecember, 1348, and January and February, 1349, although the number\r\nof institutions each month remains high until June. The [p084]\r\nmortality was apparently highest about Christmastide, 1348.[137]\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Bath and Wells remained at his manor of Wiveliscombe\r\ntill the worst was past in May of 1349. Thither came the long\r\nprocession of priests to receive their letters of institution to\r\nvacant benefices. Day after day for nearly six months the work went\r\non with hardly any cessation. Singly, or in twos and threes, often\r\nfour and five, once, at least, ten together, the clergy came to be\r\ninstituted to cures which the disease had left without a priest.\r\n\r\nHow the epidemic entered into the county, and the course it pursued,\r\nit would be now impossible, even if it were profitable, to discover.\r\nIn December it would seem to have gained a foothold in most parts\r\nof the county. It was at Evercreech about November 19th, and\r\nabout a fortnight later at Castlecary and Almsford, in the same\r\nneighbourhood. The fact that Bridgwater, Clevedon, Weston-super-mare,\r\nPortishead, and Bristol were amongst the earliest places in the\r\ncounty to be attacked would almost make it appear that the contagion\r\nwas carried to these coast towns by a boat passing up the Bristol\r\nChannel. This supposition, moreover, is somewhat confirmed, as will\r\nbe seen subsequently, by the fact that the towns of North Devon were\r\nattacked by the disease almost simultaneously with those on the south\r\ncoast, and very much about the same time as those of North Somerset.\r\n\r\nBath suffered under the scourge in the early part of January, 1349.\r\nOn the 9th and 10th of that month several [p085] institutions to\r\nlivings, either in the city or the neighbourhood, being recorded. In\r\nthe same month it had spread to the abbey of Keynsham, on the road\r\nbetween Bath and Bristol, and its path can almost be traced along\r\nthe line of communication between Bath and Wells. Thus the villages\r\nof Freshford, Twerton, Hardington, Holcombe, Cloford, Kilmersdon,\r\nBabington, Compton, and Doulting, as well as several benefices in\r\nWells itself, all fell vacant at this time.\r\n\r\nIt may be said with considerable certainty that fully half the number\r\nof beneficed clergy fell victims to the disease in this diocese. Many\r\nlivings were rendered vacant two and three times during its course;\r\nwhilst a not inconsiderable number had four changes of incumbents\r\nwithin these few months. Bathampton, for example, had four parsons\r\nappointed in this period. At Hardington, not far from Frome, from\r\nJanuary, 1349, to the middle of March, there were certainly three and\r\nperhaps four changes due to the disease; and at Yeovil, from the 15th\r\nDecember, 1348, to the 4th February, 1349, three priests held the\r\nliving, one after the other.\r\n\r\nLittle or no information is forthcoming as to the religious houses\r\nof the county at this time. Both Athelney and Muchelney lost their\r\nabbots, and probably also many of their members. The fact that the\r\ngreat abbey of Glastonbury, which previously contained within its\r\nwalls a community of some 80 monks, is found in A.D. 1377 to have\r\n44, seems to indicate that it must have suffered very severe losses\r\nthrough the epidemic.\r\n\r\nAt Bath, in 1344, only five years before the outbreak of the disease,\r\nthe community at the Priory consisted of thirty professed monks\r\nunder Prior John de Ford.[138] A list on the roll of the Somerset\r\nclergy, on whom a clerical subsidy was levied at the close of Edward\r\nthe Third's reign, in 1377, shows that the number had been reduced\r\nto sixteen,[139] [p086] and at this number it apparently remained\r\nto the time of the final dissolution of the house in the sixteenth\r\ncentury.[140]\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to understand that the plague must have raged\r\nwith great virulence in the larger cities, where in those days the\r\nmost elementary notions of sanitation were almost unknown. In the\r\nwest, Bristol, of course, suffered severely. \"There,\" says the\r\nsub-contemporary writer, Knighton, \"died, suddenly overwhelmed by\r\ndeath, almost the whole strength of the town, for few were sick more\r\nthan three days, or two days, or even half a day.\" Nor need this be\r\na subject of wonder when, according to the description of a modern\r\nwriter, speaking of the city at this very period, the streets were\r\nvery narrow; in the busier parts the ground was honeycombed with\r\ncellars for storing wine, salt, and other merchandise, whilst refuse\r\nstreamed down the centre ditch. So small was the distance between the\r\nhouses that no vehicle was allowed to be used in the streets, and all\r\ngoods were carried on pack-horses or porters, a custom which even in\r\nthe 17th century excited the wonder of Samuel Pepys.[141]\r\n\r\n\"Here in Bristol,\" says the local historian Seyer, quoting an old\r\ncalendar of the town, \"in 1348 the plague raged to such a degree that\r\nthe living were scarce able to bury the dead. The Gloucestershire men\r\nwould not suffer the Bristol men to have access to them. At last it\r\nreached Gloucester, Oxford, and London; scarce the tenth person was\r\nleft alive, male or female. At this period the grass grew several\r\ninches high in High Street and Broad Street; it raged at first\r\nchiefly in the centre of the city. This pestilence came from abroad,\r\nand the people near the sea-coast in Dorsetshire and Devonshire were\r\nfirst affected.\"[142] By the wholesale destruction of the population\r\nof this western port the same authority accounts for the reduction of\r\nthe King's taxation of the city from £245 to £158. [p087]\r\n\r\nLastly, in Bristol, as indeed without doubt in most places, the\r\ncemeteries did not long suffice for the multitude of the dead.\r\nOf this there is an example upon the Patent Rolls. The parson of\r\nHoly Cross de la Temple soon found the necessity of enlarging his\r\ngraveyard. For this purpose he obtained half-an-acre adjoining the\r\nold cemetery, and so great and pressing was the need of this fresh\r\naccommodation that it was done without the required royal license,\r\nfor which subsequently a pardon had to be sued from the King.[143]\r\n\r\nThe diocese of Exeter, comprising the two counties of Devon and\r\nCornwall, was stricken by the disease apparently about the same time\r\nas the county of Somerset.[144] For eight years before 1348 the\r\naverage number of livings annually rendered vacant in the diocese\r\nwas thirty-six,[145] whilst in the single month of January 1349, the\r\nBishop instituted to some thirty livings, which shows that death had\r\nalready been busy among the clergy.\r\n\r\nThe number of institutions in each month of the year points to\r\nthe conclusion that the disease lingered somewhat longer in these\r\ncounties than elsewhere. It is not till the close of September that\r\nany great decrease in the number of vacancies is seen, and although\r\nprobably beginning in December, the height of the plague was not\r\nreached till March, April, and May.[146] [p088]\r\n\r\nPrebendary Hingeston-Randolph thus describes the state of the Exeter\r\nepiscopal registers at this period:—\"There is very little direct\r\ninformation about the Black Death in Bishop Grandisson's register;\r\nbut there is a great deal of indirect information. The _Registrum\r\nCommune_, which is wonderfully full before and after the fatal year,\r\nrecords scarcely anything during the year itself. The ordinary work\r\nof the diocese seems to have been all suspended, with a single\r\nexception. The register of institutions—a separate volume—is a record\r\nof incessant and most distressing work. Its very outward aspect for\r\nthis period tells a tale of woe. The entries are made hurriedly and\r\nroughly, in striking contrast with the neatness and regularity of\r\nthe rest of the Register. They are no longer grouped, as before,\r\nin years, but in months, and the changes in each month exceed the\r\nchanges of a whole ordinary year, when there was no pestilence.\r\nThe scribe leaves off the customary 'vacant _per mortem_,' as if\r\nhe dreaded to write the fatal word. The clergy must have fallen by\r\nwholesale; evidently they were faithful, and, for their flocks' sake,\r\nfaced the foe without flinching. And, as each of them fell, another\r\nwas ready at his Bishop's call fearlessly to fill the vacant place.\r\nSome incumbencies lasted but a few weeks. And, when all was over,\r\nthe survivors were, comparatively, so few that there was no small\r\ndifficulty in filling many a subsequent vacant benefice; this result\r\nof the sickness is to be traced for some time after the mortality had\r\nceased.\r\n\r\n\"The Bishop never left his diocese, and the continuous presence\r\nof so strong, so earnest, and devoted a prelate must have been an\r\nunspeakable consolation and help to his grievously afflicted flock.\"\r\n\r\nAn examination of the institutions of the diocese, in relation to the\r\ntime when the plague visited the various parts of it, appears to show\r\nthat it commenced almost simultaneously in both north and south. In\r\nNorth Devon it is found at both Northam and Alverdiscott on the 7th\r\nof [p089] November, at Fremington in the same district on the 8th,\r\nand at Barnstaple on December the 23rd. It is found in November at\r\nvillages on the Exe, and had possibly also reached Exeter before the\r\nclose of the month. In the South, the fact of the close proximity of\r\nthe part first infected to Dorsetshire explains the course of the\r\nepidemic; but the early outbreak in the coast villages at the mouth\r\nof the estuary leading to Barnstaple points to the conclusion that\r\nthe infection was brought by a ship passing up the Bristol Channel,\r\nwhich subsequently infected other towns further up on the Somerset\r\nshore of the passage.\r\n\r\nIt is of interest also to note how greatly the coast towns generally\r\nappear to have suffered, as the contagion was very probably carried\r\nfrom one place to another by the fishing boats. Up some of the\r\nestuaries it would seem as if the passage of the disease could be\r\ntraced by the dates of the institutions. Thus, to take one example,\r\nin March, 1349, there is an institution to a living at the mouth of\r\nthe Fowey in Cornwall; a week later there is another at St. Winnow's\r\nVicarage higher up, and on March 22nd the sickness had reached\r\nBodmin, at no great distance from the river, and a place with which,\r\nin all probability, the passage up the estuary of the Fowey would be\r\nan ordinary and usual means of communication.\r\n\r\nAs to the result of the sickness in the religious houses of the\r\ndiocese some few details are known. At St. Nicholas', Exeter, the\r\nPrior died in March, 1349; his successor, John de Wye, was admitted\r\non the 26th of that month, but died almost immediately. The next\r\nPrior was not installed until June 7th, and the house was found to be\r\nin a deplorable state.[147] So also at Pilton Priory two superiors\r\ndied within a few weeks one of the other. At the alien priory of\r\nMinster, Cornwall, William de Huma, the Prior, was carried off by the\r\nsickness on 26th of April, 1349, and the house was so impoverished by\r\nthe death of tenants [p090] and labourers that it could not support\r\nboth its members, and the chaplain they were bound to find to do the\r\nparish work, as neither the prior nor his brethren spoke English, \"or\r\nrather Cornish.\"[148]\r\n\r\nAt the Cistercian abbey of Newenham the register records that \"in the\r\ntime of this mortality or pestilence there died in this house twenty\r\nmonks and three lay-brothers, whose names are entered in other books.\r\nAnd Walter, the abbot, and two monks were left alive there after the\r\nsickness.\"[149]\r\n\r\nAt the Augustinian abbey of Hartland, Roger de Raleghe, the abbot,\r\ndied, and the proclamation of the election of his successor is dated\r\n18th March, 1349. At Benedictine Tavistock also the abbot died, and\r\nhis successor, Richard de Esse, was taken ill after his confirmation,\r\nand, \"detained by so grave a sickness,\" could not go to the King,\r\nwho, on October 17th, commissioned Bishop Grandisson to receive his\r\nfealty.[150]\r\n\r\nAt Bodmin, according to a note taken by William of Worcester from a\r\nregister in the Church of the Friars Minor there, it was estimated\r\nthat 1,500 persons died of this sickness.[151] Amongst these was\r\nthe Vicar, whose successor was appointed on April 8th, 1349. The\r\nAugustinian priory in the town was almost depopulated. The prior,\r\nJohn de Kilkhampton, and all his brethren but two were carried off by\r\nthe sickness. The two survivors, on March 17th, wrote to the Bishop\r\nsaying that they \"were left like orphans,\" and begging that he would\r\nprovide a superior [p091] for their house at once. The next day,\r\nMarch the 18th, 1349, an inquisition was held under a writ of the\r\nPrince of Wales. The jury found that the priory was free, and that\r\nthe last prior had died \"on Friday, next after the feast of St. Peter\r\nin Cathedra then last past\" (February 27th).[152]\r\n\r\nOn March 19th Bishop Grandisson wrote to the prior of Launceston\r\nsetting forth the facts, and appointing a member of that house to the\r\noffice. Three days later the mandate for his induction was issued,\r\nin the hopes that \"by his careful watchfulness the said priory may\r\nrecover from the calamity.\"[153]\r\n\r\nThe plight to which the Augustinians of Bodmin were reduced by the\r\ndisease is, after all, typical of that of many religious houses\r\nthroughout the country. Meantime, however, the epidemic had not\r\nconfined its ravages to the western counties, but continued to spread\r\nthe same desolation in every direction, as the wave of pestilence\r\nrolled onward over the length and breadth of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[121] Originalia Roll, 24 Ed.

The contagion passed from one district to another, from\r\ntown to town, and village to village, soon involving the entire land\r\nin one common misfortune. \"There was no city, nor town, nor hamlet,\r\nnor even, save in rare instances, any house,\" writes an English\r\ncontemporary, \"in which this plague did not carry off the whole,\r\nor the greater portion, of the inhabitants.\" And so great was the\r\ndestruction of life \"that the living scarcely sufficed to tend the\r\nsick and bury the dead.\" . . . In some places, on account of the\r\ndeficiency of cemeteries, the Bishop consecrated new burial grounds.\r\n\r\n\"In that time there was sold a quarter of wheat for 12d., a quarter\r\nof barley for 9d., a quarter of beans for 8d., a quarter of oats\r\nfor 6d., a large ox for 40d., a good horse for six shillings, which\r\nformerly was worth 40 shillings, a good cow for two shillings, and\r\neven for eighteen-pence. And even at this price buyers were only\r\nrarely to be found. And this pestilence lasted for two years and more\r\nbefore England was freed from it.\"\r\n\r\n\"When, by God's mercy it ceased, there was such a scarcity of\r\nlabourers that none could be had for agricultural purposes. On\r\naccount of this scarcity, women, and even small children, were to be\r\nseen with the plough and leading the waggons.\"[154]\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which the contagion spread from place to place\r\nmakes it now impossible to follow its course with [p093] any\r\ncertainty; the more so because it seems likely that many towns on\r\nthe southern and western coasts became fresh starting points for\r\nthe disease. London, in constant communication with other ports, is\r\nsaid by one contemporary to have been attacked as early as September\r\n29th, 1348,[155] whilst other authorities fix, at latest, All Saints'\r\nday—November 1st—as the date when the epidemic declared itself in\r\nLondon. It lasted in the city and its neighbourhood till about the\r\nfeast of Pentecost next following, and according to the contemporary\r\nRobert of Avesbury, it was most severe in the two months from\r\nFebruary 2nd to Easter. During the time, he says, \"almost every day\r\nthere were buried in the new cemetery, then made at Smithfield, more\r\nthan 200 bodies of the dead, over and above those buried in other\r\ncemeteries of the city.\"[156]\r\n\r\nParliament, which was to have assembled at Westminster in January,\r\n1349, was at the beginning of the month prorogued, because, as the\r\nKing says, \"the plague of deadly pestilence had suddenly broken out\r\nin the said place and the neighbourhood, and daily increased in\r\nseverity so that grave fears were entertained for the safety of those\r\ncoming there at that time.\"[157] The churchyards of the city were\r\nquickly found to be insufficient, and two, if not three, cemeteries\r\nwere opened. Of the one in Smithfield referred to in the quotation\r\nalready given from Robert of Avesbury, the historian Stowe gives the\r\nfollowing account:—\"In the year 1348 (23 Edward III.) the first great\r\npestilence in his time began, and increased so sore that from want of\r\nroom in churchyards to bury the dead of the city and of the suburbs,\r\none John Corey, clerk, procured of Nicholas, prior of the Holy\r\nTrinity within Aldgate, one toft of ground near unto East Smithfield\r\nfor the burial of them that died, with condition that it might be\r\ncalled 'the churchyard of the Holy Trinity;' which ground he caused,\r\nby the aid of [p094] divers devout citizens, to be enclosed with a\r\nwall of stone. Robert Elsing, son of William Elsing, gave five pounds\r\nthereunto; and the same was dedicated by Ralph Stratford, Bishop\r\nof London, where innumerable bodies of the dead were afterwards\r\nburied, and a chapel built in the same place, to the honour of God.\"\r\nSubsequently Edward III. founded there a monastery of Cistercian\r\nmonks dedicated to our Lady of Graces.[158]\r\n\r\nThe same author also relates the establishment of the better-known\r\nnew cemetery, where subsequently the Charterhouse was founded.\r\n\"The churchyards,\" he writes of this time, \"were not sufficient to\r\nreceive the dead, but men were forced to choose out certain fields\r\nfor burials. Whereupon Ralph Stratford, Bishop of London, in the\r\nyear 1348, bought a piece of ground, called 'No man's land,' which\r\nhe enclosed with a wall of brick and dedicated for the burial of the\r\ndead, building thereupon a proper chapel, which is now (_i.e._, 1598)\r\nenlarged and made a dwelling-house; and this burying plot is become a\r\nfair garden, retaining the old name of 'Pardon Churchyard.'\r\n\r\n\"After this, in the year 1349, the said Sir Walter Manny, in respect\r\nof the danger that might befal in this time of so great a plague and\r\ninfection, purchased thirteen acres and a rood of ground, adjoining\r\nto the said 'No man's land,' and lying in a place called 'Spittle\r\nCroft,' because it belonged to St. Bartholomew's Hospital (since that\r\ncalled 'New Church Haw'), and caused it to be consecrated by the said\r\nBishop of London to the use of burials.\r\n\r\n\"In this plot of ground there were (in that year) more than 50,000\r\npersons buried, as I have read in the Charters of Edward the Third.\r\n\r\n\"Also I have seen and read an inscription, fixed on a stone cross\r\nsometime standing in the same churchyard, and having these words:\r\n_Anno Domini 1349._ _Regnante_, &c. That is in English, 'A great\r\nplague raging in the year of [p095] our Lord 1349, this churchyard\r\nwas consecrated; wherein, and within the bounds of the present\r\nmonastery, were buried more than 50,000 bodies of the dead, besides\r\nmany others from thence to the present time, whose souls God have\r\nmercy upon. Amen.\"[159]\r\n\r\nWhilst it is perfectly possible, and even probable, that the\r\nnumber 50,000, named by Stowe as buried in one churchyard, is an\r\nexaggerated estimate, it is on the other hand more than likely that\r\nthe pestilence found the sanitary condition of the London of that\r\nperiod very favourable for its rapid development. The narrow and\r\nill-cleansed streets, the low, unventilated and undrained houses,\r\nand the general condition of living at the time would all favour the\r\ngrowth of so contagious a disease as that which visited the city in\r\nthe middle of the fourteenth century. One slight glimpse of the state\r\nof the streets about this time is afforded in a document issued by\r\nthe King to the Mayor and Sheriffs, when in 1361 a second visitation\r\nthreatened to become as destructive to human life as that of 1349.\r\n\"Because,\" says the royal letter, \"by the killing of great beasts,\r\nfrom whose putrid blood running down the streets and the bowels cast\r\ninto the Thames, the air in the city is very much corrupted and\r\ninfected, whence abominable and most filthy stench proceeds, sickness\r\nand many other evils have happened to such as have abode in the said\r\ncity, or have resorted to it; and great dangers are feared to fall\r\nout for the time to come, unless remedy be presently made against\r\nit; we, willing to prevent such dangers, ordain, by consent of the\r\npresent Parliament, that all 'bulls, oxen, hogs, and other gross\r\ncreatures' be killed at either Stratford or Knightsbridge.\"[160]\r\n[p096]\r\n\r\nThere are indeed many indications that the number of those who\r\ndied in the city was very great.[161] The extraordinary increase in\r\nthe number of wills proved in the \"Court of Hustings\" affords some\r\nindication of this. During the three previous years the average\r\nnumber in that Court was twenty-two. In 1349 they reached the number\r\nof 222; and the wills themselves afford further evidence of the\r\nrapidity with which members of the same family followed each other\r\nto the grave. In one instance a son, who was appointed executor to\r\nhis father's will, died before probate could be obtained, and his\r\nown will was passed through the Court together with that of his\r\nfather.[162] The number of probates granted in each month is some\r\nindication of the time when the mortality was highest. May, with a\r\ntotal of 121, and July, with 51, are the largest numbers, whilst it\r\nis curious to observe that the large number in May is accounted for\r\nby the fact that none were proved in April.[163] It may be surmised\r\nthat this was brought about by the complete paralysis of all business\r\nabout the month of April in consequence of the sickness; [p097] this\r\nview being strengthened by the fact that no Easter sittings of the\r\nCourts of Justices were held.\r\n\r\nWestminster was grievously visited by the sickness. On March 10th,\r\n1349, in proroguing the Parliament for the second time, the King\r\ndeclared that the plague had increased in Westminster and London more\r\nseriously than ever.[164] Some weeks later the great monastery was\r\nattacked; early in May abbot Bircheston died, and at the same time 27\r\nof his monks were committed to a common grave in the southern walk\r\nof the cloister. To relieve the urgent necessities of the house and\r\nthose about it jewels and other ornaments to the value of £315 13s.\r\n8d.—a large sum in those days—were sold during the visitation out of\r\nthe monastic treasury.[165]\r\n\r\nAt Westminster, too, the Hospital of St. James was left without\r\ninmates. \"The then guardian and all the other brethren and sisters,\r\nexcept one,\" had died; and in May, 1349, William de Weston, the\r\nsurvivor, was appointed guardian. Charged with dilapidation, he\r\nwas deposed in 1351, but in 1353 the house still remained without\r\ninmates.[166]\r\n\r\nWhat happened at St. Albans has been recorded by Walsingham in the\r\n_Gesta Abbatum_. Speaking of abbot Michael Mentmore, he writes: \"The\r\npestilence, which carried off well-nigh half of all mankind, coming\r\nto St. Albans he was struck by a premature death, being touched by\r\nthe common misery amongst the first of his monks, who were carried\r\noff by the deadly disease. And although on Maundy Thursday (_i.e._,\r\nThursday in Holy Week) he felt the beginning of the ailment, still\r\nout of devotion to the feast, and in memory of our Lord's humility,\r\nhe celebrated solemnly the High Mass, and after that, before dinner,\r\nhumbly and reverently washed the feet of the poor. Then, after\r\npartaking of food, he washed and kissed the [p098] feet of all the\r\nbrethren. And all the offices of that day he performed alone and\r\nwithout assistance.\r\n\r\n\"On the morrow, the sickness increasing, he betook himself to bed,\r\nand like a true catholic, having made, with contrite heart, a sincere\r\nconfession, he received the Sacrament of Extreme Unction. And so in\r\nsorrow and sadness he lasted till noon of Easter-Day.\r\n\r\n\"And because the plague was then raging, and the air was corrupt,\r\nand the monks were dying day by day,\" he was buried as quickly as\r\npossible. \"And there died at that time, forty-seven monks\" over\r\nand above those who were carried off in great numbers, in (the\r\nmonasteries which are) the cells (of St. Albans).\"[167]\r\n\r\nIn another place the same writer adds: \"By God's permission came the\r\npestilence which swept away such numbers. Amongst the abbots was Dom\r\nMichael of pious memory, abbot of St. Albans. At that same time the\r\nprior of the monastery, Nicholas, and the sub-prior of the place\r\nalso died. By the advice, therefore, of those learned in the law the\r\nconvent chose Dom Thomas de Risburgh, professor of Holy Scripture, as\r\nprior of the Monastery.\"[168]\r\n\r\nFrom the date of the death of the abbot of St. Albans, on April the\r\n12th, 1349, it would appear that the epidemic was then at its height\r\nin that part of Hertfordshire. The institutions for the portion of\r\nthe county in the diocese of Lincoln, however, show that it must\r\nhave lingered on, at any rate in the northern part, till the late\r\nsummer.[169]\r\n\r\n\"In Hertfordshire Manors,\" writes Mr. Thorold Rogers, \"where it\r\n(_i.e._, the great plague of 1349) was specially [p099] destructive,\r\nit was the practice, for thirty years, to head the schedule of\r\nexpenditure with an enumeration of the lives which were lost and the\r\ntenancies which were vacated after 1348.\"[170]\r\n\r\nThe neighbouring counties of Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, and\r\nBerkshire suffered in the same way. Although the chronicles make no\r\nspecial mention of the ravages of the epidemic in them, it would,\r\nindeed, from other sources of information, appear that during the\r\nfirst half of 1349 the mortality in this district was as great as\r\nin most other parts of the country. Thus, the general state of the\r\ncountry after the plague had passed may be illustrated from a class\r\nof documents known as _Inquisitiones post mortem_. Theoretically,\r\nat least, the whole country belonged to the Sovereign; the actual\r\npossessors holding as tenants of the Crown, just as the smaller\r\nfarmers and peasants held from the tenant _in capite_. On the death\r\nof landowners, therefore, the Crown exercised certain rights and\r\nclaimed certain dues, which it levied on the estates, the King's\r\nofficers holding them until the rights of the Sovereign over the\r\nin-coming heir were satisfied. To secure these in each county, an\r\nofficial was appointed known as the Escheator, whose duty it was on\r\nthe death of any landowner, in response to the King's writ, to summon\r\na jury bound by oath to inquire into, and testify to, the extent and\r\nvalue of the land held by the deceased person. The record of their\r\nsworn verdict is known as the _Inquisitio post mortem_.\r\n\r\nThese returns made into the King's Court of Chancery, even as\r\nthey now exist—many of them having been lost, or having otherwise\r\ndisappeared—show a great increase in number in the year 1349. The\r\naverage number of these inquisitions for the two years 1346 and 1347\r\nis less than 120; in 1348 there are 130, whilst in 1349 there still\r\nexist 311 such records. That the number was very considerably [p100]\r\nmore than this appears from the entry of the writs to the various\r\nEscheators upon the \"Originalia Roll\" for 1349. From this source it\r\nmay be gathered that the number of writs issued by the King upon\r\ninformation of the death of landed proprietors was 619. Sometimes\r\nseveral such writs are addressed at one time to the Escheator to\r\ninquire into many deaths in the same place.[171]\r\n\r\nThese records afford evidence of the numbers of landowners swept off\r\nby the scourge, but their special value lies in the testimony they\r\nafford to the state of various manors and holdings examined in regard\r\nto their value after the plague had abated. The smaller tenants\r\npaying rent or performing land services were, of course, the chief\r\nelement in the value of an estate, and especially where the land was\r\nin common, as was generally the case, empty farmsteads and cottages\r\nmeant a proportional decrease in the yearly value.\r\n\r\nThus, to take some examples of the evidence of the epidemic in this\r\ndistrict. Of the manor of Sladen in Buckinghamshire, not far from\r\nBerkhampstead, a jury, about the beginning of August, 1349, declared\r\nupon oath that the mill was of no value, since the miller was dead\r\nand there were no tenants left to want any corn ground, \"because of\r\nthe mortality.\" The rents derived hitherto from the free tenants,\r\nnatives of the soil and cottagers, had been £12 a year, now it is\r\ndeclared that there are no tenants at all, and that the land is\r\nlying untilled and useless. On the whole manor one little cottage,\r\nwith a strip of land, held by one John Robyns on a service rent\r\nworth seven shillings a year, was apparently all that was considered\r\nto be worth anything. At another place on the same estate all the\r\ntenants and cottars except one were dead, and at a third not one had\r\nsurvived.[172]\r\n\r\n[p101] In Bedfordshire, by the end of May, 1349, the same tale is\r\ntold. A cloth mill on the manor of Storington is said to be idle and\r\nworthless, and the reason assigned is that \"it stands empty through\r\nthe mortality of the plague, and there is no one who wishes to use\r\nit or rent it for the same reason.\" Land, too, is described as lying\r\nuncultivated, and woods cannot be sold because there is no one to\r\nbuy.[173]\r\n\r\nIn Berkshire, in July, 1349, on a manor belonging to the Husee family\r\nthe rents and services of the natives of the soil, \"now dead,\" which\r\nwere formerly worth thirty-two shillings a year, are declared to be\r\nwithout any value at all, because, as the Inquisition says, \"there is\r\nno one willing to buy or to hire the land of the said dead tenants,\"\r\nand since the land lay all in common it could not be cultivated, and\r\nwas thus useless.[174] In the same way, on the manor of Crokham,\r\nwhich had belonged to Catherine, wife of the Earl of Salisbury,\r\neven as early as April 23rd of this year the free tenants and other\r\nholders, who had paid yearly £13, were all dead, and no tenants could\r\nbe got to take up their lands.[175] In other places there are no\r\nCourt fees, no services performed, and no mills used, because all\r\non the land are dead; houses and tenements also are in hand, and\r\nrents everywhere are either reduced or are nothing at all, because\r\nsome or all of those who held the lands and cottages have been swept\r\naway.[176]\r\n\r\nThe institutions for the county of Buckingham show that in the\r\nyear 1349[177] there were eighty-three appointments made to vacant\r\nlivings. This is slightly less than half the total number of\r\nbenefices in the county, which appears to have been 180. From the\r\nappointments that are dated it [p102] appears probable that the\r\nsickness was at its worst in the county in the months from May till\r\nSeptember, 1349.[178]\r\n\r\nOn the other side of London, the dioceses of Canterbury and\r\nRochester divide between them the county of Kent. The Archbishop had\r\njurisdiction over the south-eastern portion with its long line of\r\ncoast stretching from the Medway to the boundaries of Sussex. The\r\ndiocese of Rochester included the western portion of Kent, which lies\r\non the southern bank of the Thames from London to Sheerness. The\r\ndiocese of Canterbury was in many respects peculiarly exposed to the\r\nchances of contagion. In it were situated both Dover and Sandwich,\r\nthe two chief points of communication with the ports of France, and\r\nthrough the city of Canterbury passed the main line of road between\r\nthe coast and London.\r\n\r\nThrice, within a few months, the Archiepiscopal See was deprived by\r\ndeath of its ruler; and one, at least, of these, and very probably\r\ntwo, died of the prevailing sickness. The register of the prior\r\nand convent of Christchurch, Canterbury, during the vacancy, shows\r\nthat institutions to livings in the diocese followed one another\r\nin rapid succession, and that deaths must have occurred in a large\r\nproportion of the benefices of this part of England.[179] \"In the\r\nyear of our Lord, 1348, immediately after the close of the Nativity,\"\r\nwrites Stephen Birchington, in his history of the Archbishops of\r\nCanterbury, \"arrived the common death of all people; and it lasted\r\ncontinuously till the end of the month of May, in the year 1349.\r\nBy this pestilence barely a third part of mankind were left alive.\r\nThen, also, there was such a scarcity and dearth of priests that\r\nthe [p103] parish churches remained almost unserved, and beneficed\r\npersons, through fear of death, left the care of the benefices, not\r\nknowing where to go.\"[180]\r\n\r\nAt Canterbury itself there is some evidence of the epidemic. The\r\nabbot of St. Augustine's had died of the disease at Avignon; but no\r\ninformation has been preserved of what took place at the monastery\r\nitself, although the fact that abbot Thomas asked for and obtained\r\nfrom Pope Clement VI dispensations, \"on account of defect of birth,\"\r\nfor six monks, whom he desired to have ordained at this time, makes\r\nit more than probable that the pestilence had carried off many\r\nmembers of the community, whose places it was necessary to fill.\r\n\r\nAt Christchurch only four of the community died at the time, and\r\nthis comparative immunity has been ascribed to the excellent\r\nwater supply obtained a century before for the monastery from the\r\nhills.[181] Later on in the summer, however, when the new abbot of\r\nSt. Albans rested at Canterbury, on his way to the Pope at Avignon,\r\none of the two companions whom he had with him died of the sickness\r\nthere.[182] In the city, also, two masters were appointed to the\r\nHospital of Eastbridge, one quickly after the other. The prioress of\r\nSt. Sepulchre's and the prior of St. Gregory's both died; but we can\r\nonly suspect what happened in the communities at this anxious time,\r\nand among the people at large. At Sandwich, in the June of 1349, the\r\nplague was still raging. The old cemetery was full to overflowing,\r\nand the suffragan bishop was commissioned to proceed thither and\r\nconsecrate a new piece of ground, given for the purpose by the Earl\r\nof Huntingdon.[183]\r\n\r\nOne example may be given here of the rapidity with which during the\r\ngreat sickness members of a family [p104] followed one another\r\nto the grave. Sir Thomas Dene, of Ospring, about three miles from\r\nFaversham, in the northern part of the diocese of Rochester,\r\ndied on May the 18th, 1349. At the time of his death he had four\r\ndaughters—Benedicta, five years old, Margaret, four years, and Martha\r\nand Joan, younger still. By July the 8th Martha, the wife of Sir\r\nThomas, had also died, and from the inquisition, taken on Monday, the\r\n3rd of August, 1349, it appears that of the children the two youngest\r\nwere now also dead. Thus, out of a family of six, the father, mother,\r\nand two children had been carried off by the disease.[184]\r\n\r\nIn this second half of the county of Kent, which forms the diocese\r\nof Rochester, the sickness was felt as severely as in the Canterbury\r\ndiocese. What happened here is told in the account of William Dene,\r\na monk of Rochester, and a contemporary of the events he describes.\r\n\"A plague such as never before had been heard of,\" he writes,\r\n\"ravaged England in this year. The Bishop of Rochester out of his\r\nsmall household lost four priests, five gentlemen, ten serving men,\r\nseven young clerks, and six pages, so that not a soul remained who\r\nmight serve him in any office. At Malling (a Benedictine nunnery)\r\nhe blessed two abbesses, and both quickly died, and there were left\r\nthere only four professed nuns and four novices. To one of these the\r\nBishop committed the charge of the temporals, to another that of the\r\nspirituals, because no proper person for abbess could be found.\"\r\n\r\n\"The whole of this time,\" says the writer in another place, \"the\r\nBishop of Rochester remained at Halling[185] and Trotterscliff,[186]\r\nand he conferred orders in both places at certain intervals. Alas,\r\nfor our sorrow! this mortality swept away so vast a multitude of both\r\nsexes that none could be found to carry the corpses to the grave. Men\r\nand women bore their own offspring on their shoulders to the church\r\n[p105] and cast them into a common pit. From these there proceeded\r\nso great a stench that hardly anyone dared to cross the cemeteries.\"\r\n\r\nThe chronicler calls attention, in the most distinct terms, to a\r\nfact mentioned by Birchington of Canterbury, and touched on by the\r\nBishop of Bath and Wells (p. 81), namely, that dread of the contagion\r\ninterfered even with the exercise of priestly functions. These are,\r\nperhaps, the only cases in England which recall the terrible and\r\nuncontrollable fear which in Italy issued in an abandonment of all\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nAgain, he says: \"In this pestilence many chaplains and paid clerics\r\nrefused to serve, except at excessive salaries. The Bishop of\r\nRochester, by a mandate addressed to the archdeacon of Rochester,\r\non the 27th of June, 1349, orders all these, on pain of suspension,\r\nto serve such cures;\"[187] \"and some priests and clerics refuse\r\nlivings, now vacant in law and fact,\" writes the Bishop, \"because\r\nthey are slenderly provided for; and some, having poor livings, which\r\nthey had long ago obtained, are now unwilling to keep them, because\r\ntheir stipend, on account of the death of their parishioners, is so\r\nnotoriously diminished that they cannot get a living and bear the\r\nburden of their cure. It has accordingly happened that parishes have\r\nremained unserved for a long time, and the cure attached to them has\r\nbeen abandoned to the great danger of souls. We, desiring to remedy\r\nthis as soon as possible, by the present letters permit and grant\r\nspecial leave to all rectors and vicars of our city and diocese\r\ninstituted, or hereafter to be instituted, to such slender benefices\r\nas do not produce a true revenue of ten marks sterling a year, to\r\nreceive during their poverty an anniversary mass, or such a number of\r\nmasses as may bring their stipends to this annual sum.\"[188] [p106]\r\n\r\nThen after noting that the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas\r\nBradwardine, had died in the Bishop of Rochester's palace in London,\r\nWilliam Dene continues: \"So great was the deficiency of labourers\r\nand workmen of every kind in those days that more than a third of\r\nthe land over the whole kingdom remained uncultivated. The labourers\r\nand skilled workmen were imbued with such a spirit of rebellion that\r\nneither king, law, nor justice could curb them. The whole people for\r\nthe greater part ever became more depraved, more prone to every vice,\r\nand more inclined than before to evil and wickedness, not thinking\r\nof death, nor of the past plague, nor of their own salvation. . . .\r\nAnd priests, little weighing the sacrifice of a contrite spirit,\r\nbetook themselves to places where they could get larger stipends than\r\nin their own benefices. On which account many benefices remained\r\nunserved, whose holders would not be stayed by the rule of their\r\nOrdinary. Thus, day by day, the dangers to soul both in clergy and in\r\npeople multiplied.\"\r\n\r\n\"Throughout the whole of that winter and spring the Bishop of\r\nRochester, an old and decrepid man, remained at Trotterscliff,\r\nsaddened and grieving over the sudden change of the age. And in\r\nevery manor of the Bishopric buildings and walls fell to ruins, and\r\nthat year there was hardly a manor which returned a hundred pounds.\r\nIn the monastery of Rochester, also, there was such a scarcity of\r\nprovisions that the community were troubled with great want of food;\r\nso much so that the monks were obliged to grind their own bread.\"\r\nThe prior, however, adds the writer, always lived well. William Dene\r\nalso relates much that will come under consideration when the results\r\nof the great pestilence are dealt with. Here, however, it may be\r\nnoted that he speaks of \"the Bishop visiting the abbey of Malling\r\nand the monastery of Lesnes,\" when he found them so poor \"that, as\r\nis thought, from the present age to the Day of Judgment they can\r\nnever recover.\" Moreover, he notes that Simon Islep, on the day of\r\nhis enthronisation [p107] as Archbishop of Canterbury, did not keep\r\nthe feast, as was usual, with great display, but to avoid all expense\r\nkept it simply with the monks in their refectory at Christchurch.[189]\r\n\r\nTo this account of the state of the diocese of Rochester, written at\r\nthe time, it is only necessary to add that the number of benefices\r\nin this portion of Kent was some 230, which will serve as some\r\nindication of the number of clergy carried off by the prevailing\r\nsickness.\r\n\r\nThe diocese of Winchester includes the two counties of Surrey and\r\nHampshire and the Isle of Wight. On the 24th of October, 1348, Bishop\r\nEdyndon, the occupant of the see, addressed a letter to his clergy\r\nordering prayers.[190] It bears upon it the stamp of the horror which\r\nhad seized upon the minds of all by reason of the reports now coming\r\nto hand of what had taken place in other countries. \"William, by\r\nDivine providence, Bishop,\" he writes, \"to the prior and chapter of\r\nour Church of Winchester, health, grace, and benediction. A voice in\r\nRama has been heard; much weeping and crying has sounded throughout\r\nthe various countries of the globe. Nations, deprived of their\r\nchildren in the abyss of an unheard plague, refuse to be consoled\r\nbecause, as is terrible to hear of, cities, towns, castles, and\r\nvillages, adorned with noble and handsome buildings, and wont up to\r\nthe present to rejoice in an illustrious people, in their wisdom and\r\ncounsel, in their strength, and in the beauty of their matrons and\r\nvirgins; wherein, too, every joy abounded, and whither multitudes\r\nof people flocked from afar for relief; all these have already been\r\nstripped of their population by the calamity of the said pestilence,\r\nmore cruel than any two-edged sword. And into these said places now\r\nnone dare enter, but fly far from them as from the dens of wild\r\nbeasts. Every joy has ceased in them; pleasant [p108] sounds are\r\nhushed, and every note of gladness is banished. They have become\r\nabodes of horror and a very wilderness; fruitful country places,\r\nwithout the tillers, thus carried off, are deserts and abandoned to\r\nbarrenness. And, news most grave which we report with the deepest\r\nanxiety, this cruel plague, as we have heard, has already begun to\r\nsingularly afflict the various coasts of the realm of England. We\r\nare struck with the greatest fear lest, which God forbid, the fell\r\ndisease ravage any part of our city and diocese. And although God,\r\nto prove our patience, and justly to punish our sins, often afflicts\r\nus, it is not in man's power to judge the Divine counsels. Still, it\r\nis much to be feared that man's sensuality, which, propagated by the\r\ntendency of the old sin of Adam, from youth inclines all to evil, has\r\nnow fallen into deeper malice and justly provoked the Divine wrath by\r\na multitude of sins to this chastisement.\r\n\r\n\"But because God is loving and merciful, patient, and above all\r\nhatred, we earnestly beg that by your devotion He may ward off\r\nfrom us the scourge we have so justly deserved, if we now turn to\r\nHim humbly with our whole heart. We exhort you in the Lord, and in\r\nvirtue of obedience we strictly enjoin you to come before the face\r\nof God, with contrition and confession of all your sins, together\r\nwith the consequent due satisfaction through the efficacious works of\r\nsalutary penance. We order further that every Sunday and Wednesday\r\nall of you, assembled together in the choir of your monastery, say\r\nthe seven Penitential psalms, and the fifteen gradual psalms, on\r\nyour knees, humbly and devoutly. Also on every Friday, together with\r\nthese Psalms, we direct that you chant the long litany, instituted\r\nagainst pestilences of this kind by the holy Fathers, through the\r\nmarket-place of our city of Winchester, walking in procession,\r\ntogether with the clergy and people of the said city. We desire that\r\nall should be summoned to these solemn processions and urged to\r\nmake use of other devout exercises, and [p109] directed to follow\r\nthese processions in such a way that during their course they walk\r\nwith heads bent down, with feet bare, and fasting; whilst with pious\r\nhearts they repeat their prayers and, putting away vain conversation,\r\nsay, as often as possible, the Lord's Prayer and Hail Mary. Also\r\nthat they should remain in earnest prayer to the close of the Mass,\r\nwhich at the end of the procession we desire you to celebrate in your\r\nchurch.\" The Bishop then concludes by granting indulgences to those\r\nwho approach the Sacrament of Confession, and shall in these public\r\ndevotions pray that God \"may cause the severity of the plague to be\r\nstayed.\"[191]\r\n\r\nOn the same day, October 24th, 1348, Bishop Edyndon issued other\r\nmandates to his clergy generally, and to the archdeacon of\r\nSurrey in particular. He charges them to see that, in view of\r\nthe terrible plague which was approaching, all are exhorted to\r\nfrequent the Sacrament of Penance and to join in the public prayers\r\nand processions to be made with bare feet in towns through the\r\nmarket-places, and in villages in the cemeteries round about the\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\nOn November 17th, on the nearer approach of the epidemic, the Bishop\r\ngranted faculties to absolve from all reserved cases, reminding his\r\npeople of \"the approved teaching of the holy Fathers, that sickness\r\nand premature death often come from sin; and that by the healing of\r\nsouls this kind of sickness is known to cease.\" To guard against any\r\npossible danger of cloistered nuns being left by the death of their\r\nchaplains without confessors, he at the same time sent to every\r\nabbess and superior of religious women in his diocese permission to\r\nappoint two or three fit priests, to whom he gave faculties to hear\r\nthe confessions of the nuns.[192]\r\n\r\nBefore Christmas time the sickness was already in the diocese,\r\nalthough it was only beginning. On the 19th of [p110] January, 1349,\r\nBishop Edyndon wrote to his official that he had good tidings to\r\nannounce—tidings which he had received with joy—that \"the most holy\r\nfather in Christ, our lord the Supreme Pontiff, had in response to\r\nthe petition of himself and his subjects, on account of the imminent\r\ngreat mortality, granted to all the people of the diocese, religious\r\nand secular, ecclesiastic and lay, who should confess their sins\r\nwith sincere repentance to any priest they might choose—a plenary\r\nindulgence at the hour of death if they departed in the true faith,\r\nin unity with the holy Roman Church, and obedience and devotion to\r\nour lord the Supreme Pontiff and his successors the Roman Bishops.\"\r\nThe Bishop consequently ordered that this privilege should be made\r\nknown to all as quickly as possible.[193]\r\n\r\nAt Winchester, as at this time in other places, difficulties about\r\nthe burial of the dead who were carried off by the pestilence soon\r\narose. By January many benefices in the city had been rendered\r\nvacant, and without doubt the daily death-roll was becoming alarming.\r\nThe clergy for many reasons were desirous of restricting burials\r\nto the consecrated cemeteries, but a party of the citizens had\r\nclearly made up their minds that in such an emergency as the present\r\nthe ordinary rules and laws should be, and must be, set aside. In\r\norder, apparently, the better to enforce their views they set upon\r\nand seriously wounded a monk of St. Swithun's, who was conducting\r\na funeral in the usual burial place. The Bishop took a serious\r\nview of the offence. On January the 21st, 1349, he addressed an\r\norder to the prior of Winchester and the abbot of Hyde ordering\r\nsermons to be preached on the Catholic doctrine of the resurrection\r\nof the flesh, and excommunication to be denounced against [p111]\r\nthose who had laid violent hands upon brother Ralph de Staunton,\r\nmonk of Winchester. \"The Catholic Church spread over the world,\"\r\nhe says, \"believes in the resurrection of the bodies of the dead.\r\nThese have been sanctified by the reception of the Sacraments, and\r\nare hence buried, not in profane places, but in specially enclosed\r\nand consecrated cemeteries, or churches, where with due reverence\r\nthey are kept, like the relics of the Saints, till the day of the\r\nresurrection.\" Winchester, he continues, should set an example to\r\nthe whole diocese, and above other places ought to reflect the\r\nbrightness of the Catholic Faith. Some people there, however, not,\r\nhe thanks God, citizens, or even those born in the city (who are\r\nwont to be conspicuous in their upright lives and in their devotion\r\nto the Faith), but low class strangers and degenerate sons of the\r\nChurch, lately attacked brother Ralph de Staunton whilst burying in\r\nthe appointed place, and when by his habit and tonsure they knew him\r\nto be a monk, beat him and prevented him from continuing to bury the\r\ndead amongst those there waiting for the resurrection. Thinking,\r\ntherefore, that mischief was likely to ensue in regard to the true\r\nCatholic belief in the resurrection of the dead, he orders the\r\ndoctrine to be preached in the churches of Winchester. From all this\r\nit is quite evident that the crisis had brought to the surface, as it\r\nhad previously done in Italy, a denial of the first principles of the\r\nCatholic Faith.\r\n\r\nBishop Edyndon further adds that seeing that \"at this time\" the\r\nmultitude of the faithful who are dying is greater than ever before,\r\nprovision should be made \"that the people of the various parishes\r\nmay have prompt opportunity for speedy burial,\" and that the old\r\ncemeteries should be enlarged and new ones dedicated.[194]\r\n\r\nThis, however, did not end the difficulties. On the 13th of February,\r\n1349, letters were directed by the King to the abbot of Hyde, John\r\nde Hampton, Robert de Popham, [p112] and William de Fyfhide,[195]\r\nordering them to hear and determine a complaint made by the Venerable\r\nFather, William de Edyndon, Bishop of Winchester, concerning the\r\nbreaking down of walls and other boundaries of the enclosure, whereon\r\nthe abbey of Hyde formerly stood, adjoining the cemetery of the\r\nCathedral church of St. Swithun's, Winchester, which had been granted\r\nto the priory by the King, Henry I., on the removal of the abbey. It\r\nappears from the document that \"the Mayor, bailiffs, and citizens\r\nhad entered upon the usurped portions of the said land, and employed\r\nthe site thereof to hold a market twice in the week and a fair twice\r\nin the year.\" By this \"the bodies of the dead had been iniquitously\r\ndisturbed because, owing to the great mortality and pestilence of\r\nlate, and the smallness of the parochial burial grounds, the Bishop\r\nin the exercise of his office had consecrated the said ground, and\r\nmany interments had taken place in it.\" The Commissioners, or two or\r\nthree of them, are directed to view the said area, cemeteries, and\r\ncloses, \"to empanel a jury, and to examine evidence and generally to\r\ntry the case.\"[196]\r\n\r\nTaking the dates of the institutions to livings in the county of\r\nHampshire[197] as some indication of the period [p113] when the\r\ndeaths were most frequent, it would appear that the height of the\r\nplague was reached in the months of February, March, and April, 1349.\r\nIn one month, May, indeed, the number of benefices filled was more\r\nthan double the average of the whole twelve months of any of the\r\nthree previous years.\r\n\r\nIn the county of Surrey, March, April, and May were apparently the\r\nworst months; and in the last named the number of clergy instituted\r\nto vacant livings was double that of the previous yearly average.[198]\r\n\r\nSome districts were affected more than others. Thus in the deanery\r\nof Basingstoke, in the north of Hampshire, at one time or other,\r\nand chiefly in the month of March, by far the greater proportion of\r\nbenefices fell vacant. On the western side of the county several\r\ninstitutions are made in February, and a considerable number in\r\nMarch. Ivychurch priory, in Wiltshire, where the prior died on\r\nFebruary 2nd, and all the rest of the community but one quickly\r\nfollowed him to the grave, is situated close to the boundaries of\r\nHampshire, and an institution was made to a living not far distant\r\non February the 7th. One of the earliest vacancies was Fordingbridge\r\nvicarage, also not far from Wiltshire, which appointment was made on\r\nthe 21st of December, 1348. Only two days later there was apparently\r\nthe first beginning of the plague at Southampton. The southern coast\r\nof the county generally round about Portsmouth and Hayling island\r\nsuffered chiefly in April and March, and in the later month are\r\nrecorded numerous institutions to livings in the Isle of [p114]\r\nWight and in the country between the southdowns and the sea. On\r\nJanuary the 14th, 1349, a new vicar was appointed to Wandsworth by\r\nBishop Edyndon, \"because to our pastoral office it belongs,\" he says,\r\n\"to have charge of the churches, and to provide for the needs and\r\nwants, especially whilst the present mortality among men continues to\r\nrage.\"[199]\r\n\r\nMr. F. J. Baigent, who for many years has made the episcopal\r\nregisters and other muniments of the diocese of Winchester his\r\nspecial study, writing of the effects of this great epidemic, says:\r\n\"We have no means of ascertaining the actual havoc occasioned among\r\nthe religious houses of this diocese . . . but in the hospital of\r\nSandown, in Surrey, there existed not a single survivor, and of other\r\nreligious houses in the diocese (which comprises only two counties)\r\nthere perished no fewer than 28 superiors, abbots, abbesses, and\r\npriors.\"\r\n\r\nOf Sussex, the adjoining county to Hampshire, which is conterminous\r\nwith the diocese of Chichester, the loss of the episcopal registers\r\nmakes it difficult to speak with certainty as to the number of clergy\r\nswept off by the pestilence or as to its effect upon the religious\r\nhouses. It is certain, however, that the disease was not less\r\nvirulent here than in other places about which definite information\r\nis obtainable.\r\n\r\nAt Winchelsea the King, in the year of the plague, 1349, granted to\r\nJohn de Scarle, the parson, a messuage to the east of the cemetery of\r\nthe church, which formerly belonged to Matilda Lycotin, who had died\r\nwithout leaving any heirs. \"Out of devotion to St. Thomas,\" the King\r\ngives this house to the church for a rectory house for ever.[200]\r\nThat the town suffered considerably seems clear from the fact that in\r\nthis year, 1349, \"ninety-four places in the said town lie altogether\r\ndeserted and uninhabited.\"[201] [p115] And both here and at Rye the\r\nbailiffs claim that in 1354 they have not received £8 1s. out of £11.\r\n17s. 5d., supposed to be due from them, for taxes on these towns,\r\nbecause so many houses are destroyed and lie desolate there.\"[202]\r\n\r\nIncidentally it is known that John de Waring, abbot of Boxgrove, died\r\nsome time before May 20th, on which day the monks had leave to elect\r\nanother superior. Also from a chance entry in the Ely registers it\r\nappears that on July the 25th, 1349, a new vicar was instituted to\r\nWhaddon, in Cambridgeshire, on the presentation of the fourth prior\r\nof the Monastery of Lewes, to which the living was appropriated. It\r\nis explained that the reason why the fourth superior in the house had\r\npresented was because \"the prior, sub-prior, and third prior were\r\nall dead.\"[203] Lastly, a year or two after the epidemic had passed,\r\neven Battle abbey is said to be in great straits, and \"in many ways\r\ndilapidated\" (_multipliciter dilapidatur_), about which the King\r\norders an inquiry.[204]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[154] _Eulogium Historiarum_ (Rolls series), iii, p. 213.\r\n\r\n[155] _Annales de Bermundeseia_ in _Annales Monastici_ (Rolls\r\nseries), iii, p. 475.\r\n\r\n[156] _De gestis Edwardi III_ (Rolls series), p. 406.\r\n\r\n[157] Rymer, _Fœdera_, v, p. 655.\r\n\r\n[158] _Survey of London_ (ed.

In somewhat less\r\ndetail the story of its ravages in Gloucester, Oxfordshire, and the\r\nMidlands must be here told. First, however, the general account given\r\nin the chronicle of Galfrid le Baker, who appears to have been a\r\nnative of this district, may here find a place.\r\n\r\nIn all these narratives there is, of course much repetition. But it\r\nis just this absolute coincidence, even to the use of the same terms,\r\nin writers of different countries, or even of the same country, who\r\ncould not have had any communication with one another, that brings\r\nhome to the mind the literal reality of statements which, when\r\nread each one by itself, inevitably appear as gross and incredible\r\nexaggeration. It so raged at Bristol, writes Le Baker, that the\r\npeople of Gloucester refused those of Bristol access to their town,\r\nall considering that the breath of those so dying was infectious to\r\nthe living. But in the end Gloucester, and Oxford, and London, and\r\nfinally all England, were so violently attacked that hardly a tenth\r\npart of both sexes survived. The cemeteries not being sufficient,\r\nfields were chosen as burial-places for the dead. The Bishop of\r\nLondon bought a croft, called 'No man's land,' in London, and Sir\r\nWalter de Manny one called 'The new church-hawe' (where he has\r\nfounded a house of religious) to bury the dead. Cases in the King's\r\nBench and in the Common Pleas necessarily ceased. A few nobles died,\r\namongst whom was Sir John Montgomery, [p117] Captain of Calais and\r\nthe Lord of Clistel (?) in Calais,[205] and they were buried at the\r\nFriars of the Blessed Mary of Carmel, in London. An innumerable\r\nnumber of the common people and a multitude of religious and other\r\nclerics passed away. The mortality attacked the young and strong\r\nespecially, and commonly spared the old and weak. Scarce anyone dared\r\nto have contact with a sick person; the healthy fled, leaving the\r\ngoods of the dead as if infected. Swellings suddenly breaking out in\r\nvarious parts of the body, racked the sick. So hard and dry were they\r\nthat, when cut, scarcely any fluid matter came from them. From this\r\nform of the plague many, through the cutting, after much suffering,\r\nrecovered. Others had small black pustules distributed over the whole\r\nskin of the body, from which very few, and indeed hardly anyone,\r\nregained life and strength.\r\n\r\n\"This terrible pestilence, which began at Bristol on the Feast of the\r\nAssumption of the Glorious Virgin, and in London about the Feast of\r\nSt. Michael, raged in England for a whole year and more so severely\r\nthat it completely emptied many country villages of every individual\r\nof the human species. . . . The following year it devastated Wales\r\nas well as England, and then passing over to Ireland it killed the\r\nEnglish inhabitants there in great numbers, but the pure-blooded\r\nIrish, living in the mountains and high lands, it hardly touched till\r\nA.D. 1357, when unexpectedly it destroyed them everywhere.\"[206]\r\n\r\nThe mention by Le Baker of Wales and Ireland suggests a brief\r\nstatement of what is recorded as to the ravages of the pestilence\r\nin these two countries. Of Wales hardly anything is known for\r\ncertain, although the few items of information that we possess make\r\nit tolerably certain that Le Baker's statement that it \"devastated\"\r\nthe country is [p118] not exaggerated. In April, 1350, Thomas de\r\nClopton, to whom the lands of the late Earl of Pembroke, Laurence de\r\nHastings, had been leased during the minority of the heir, petitioned\r\nthe King for a reduction of £140 out of the £340 he had engaged to\r\npay. The property was chiefly situated in the county of Pembroke, and\r\nthe petitioner urges that, \"by reason of the mortal pestilence lately\r\nso rife in those parts, the ordinary value\" of the land could not be\r\nmaintained. Upon inquiry the statement was found to be true, and £60\r\narrears were remitted, as well as £40 a year taken off the rent.[207]\r\nNo institutions for any of the four Welsh dioceses are forthcoming;\r\nbut on the supposition that half the number of the beneficed clergy\r\nin the Principality were carried off by the sickness, the number of\r\nbenefices in Wales being about 788, the total mortality among the\r\nbeneficed clergy would be nearly 400.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the religious houses in Wales also, little is known\r\nas to the effect of the pestilence. The priory of Abergavenny, an\r\nalien priory then in the King's hands, was forgiven the rent due to\r\nthe King's exchequer, as the prior found it impossible to obtain\r\npayment at this time for his lands.[208] And seven-and-twenty years\r\nlater, the small number in some fairly large religious houses raises\r\nthe suspicion that they, like so many English monasteries at this\r\ntime, had not regained their normal strength after their losses.\r\nThus the Cistercian abbey of Whitland, in Carmarthen, in 1377 had\r\nonly a community of the abbot and six monks; the Augustinian priory\r\nat Carmarthen had but five beside the prior; the Premonstratensian\r\nabbey of Tallagh only an abbot and five canons, whilst the prior of\r\nKidwelly, a cell of Sherborne abbey in Dorset, had not even a socius\r\nwith him.[209]\r\n\r\nSome account of what happened in Ireland may be [p119] gathered\r\nfrom the relation of friar John Clyn, a Minorite of Kilkenny, who\r\nhimself apparently perished in the epidemic. \"Also this year (_i.e._,\r\n1349),\"[210] he writes, \"and particularly in the months of September\r\nand October, bishops, prelates, ecclesiastics, religious, nobles\r\nand others, and all of both sexes generally, came from all parts\r\nof Ireland in bands and in great numbers to the pilgrimage and the\r\npassage of the water of That-Molyngis. So much so, that on many\r\ndays you could see thousands of people flocking there, some through\r\ndevotion, others (and indeed most) through fear of the pestilence,\r\nwhich then was very prevalent. It first commenced near Dublin, at\r\nHowth[211] and at Drogheda. These cities—Dublin and Drogheda—it\r\nalmost destroyed and emptied of inhabitants, so that, from the\r\nbeginning of August to the Nativity of our Lord, in Dublin alone,\r\n14,000 people died.\"\r\n\r\nThen after speaking of the commencement of the plague and its ravages\r\nat Avignon, the author continues:—\"From the beginning of all time it\r\nhas not been heard that so many have died, in an equal time, from\r\npestilence, famine, or any sickness in the world; for earthquakes,\r\nwhich were felt for long distances, cast down and swallowed up\r\ncities, towns, and castles. The plague too almost carried off every\r\ninhabitant from towns, cities and castles, so that there was hardly\r\na soul left to dwell there. This pestilence was so contagious that\r\nthose touching the dead, or those sick of it, were at once infected\r\nand died, and both the penitent and the confessor were together borne\r\nto the grave. Through fear and horror men hardly dared to perform\r\nworks of piety and mercy; that is, visiting the sick and burying the\r\ndead. For many died from abscesses and from impostumes and pustules,\r\nwhich appeared on the [p120] thighs and under the arm-pits; others\r\ndied from affection of the head, and, as if in frenzy; others through\r\nvomiting of blood.\r\n\r\n\"This year was wonderful and full of prodigies in many ways; still\r\nit was fertile and abundant, although sickly and productive of great\r\nmortality. In the convent of the Minorites of Drogheda 25, and in\r\nthat of Dublin 23, friars died before Christmas.\r\n\r\n\"The pestilence raged in Kilkenny during Lent, for by the 6th of\r\nMarch eight friars Preachers had died since Christmas. Hardly\r\never did only one die in any house, but commonly husband and wife\r\ntogether, with their children, passed along the same way, namely, the\r\nway of death.\r\n\r\n\"And I, brother John Clyn, of the order of Minorites, and the convent\r\nof Kilkenny, have written these noteworthy things, which have\r\nhappened in my time and which I have learnt as worthy of belief. And\r\nlest notable acts should perish with time, and pass out of the memory\r\nof future generations, seeing these many ills, and that the world is\r\nplaced in the midst of evils, I, as if amongst the dead, waiting till\r\ndeath do come, have put into writing truthfully what I have heard and\r\nverified. And that the writing may not perish with the scribe, and\r\nthe work fail with the labourer, I add parchment to continue it, if\r\nby chance anyone may be left in the future and any child of Adam may\r\nescape this pestilence and continue the work thus commenced.\"[212]\r\n\r\nThis account of friar Clyn is borne out by one or two documents on\r\nthe Patent Rolls. Thus in July, 1350, the Mayor and Bailiffs of Cork\r\nstated in a petition for relief \"that, both because of the late\r\npestilence in those parts, and the destruction and wasting of lands,\r\nhouses, and possessions, by our Irish enemies round about the said\r\ncity,\" they were unable to pay the 80 marks' tax upon the [p121]\r\nplace.[213] Also the citizens of Dublin, in begging to be allowed\r\nto have 1,000 quarters of corn sent for their relief, state in the\r\npetition of their Mayor \"that the merchants and other inhabitants of\r\nthe city are gravely impoverished by the pestilence lately existing\r\nin the said country, and other many misfortunes which had happened\r\nthere.\"[214] Lastly, the tenants of the royal manors in Ireland asked\r\nthe King for special protection. They urged that \"both by reason of\r\nthe pestilence lately existing in the said country, and because of\r\nthe excessive price of provisions and other goods charged by some of\r\nthe officers of the land to the tenants, they are absolutely reduced\r\nto a state of poverty.\"[215]\r\n\r\nAfter this brief digression upon the plague in Wales and Ireland,\r\na return may be made to England. The county of Worcester suffered\r\nfrom the disease chiefly in the summer months of the year 1349. The\r\ninstitutions to livings in the county, show that in 67 parishes out\r\nof 138 the incumbent changes at this time. In several instances\r\nthere are recorded more than one change, so that fully half of the\r\ntotal number of benefices in the county were at one time or other\r\nvacant during the progress of the disease. The highest number of\r\nappointments to livings in the county in any one month was in\r\nJuly, whilst each month from May to November gives indication of\r\nsome special cause at work producing the vacancies. In the first\r\nfour months of the year and in December only six institutions are\r\nrecorded.[216] As examples of benefices which fell vacant [p122]\r\nmore than once during the period there may be adduced Great Malvern,\r\nto which priests were presented on the 10th of July and the 21st\r\nof August; and Powick, near Worcester, to which institutions are\r\nregistered on the 15th of May and the 10th of July.\r\n\r\nIn the city of Worcester, as early as the middle of April,\r\ndifficulties as to the disposal of the bodies of the dead were\r\nforeseen and provided against by the Bishop, Wulstan de Braunsford,\r\nwho himself, an old and infirm man, died on the 6th of August, 1349.\r\nOn the 18th of April, this year, the Bishop wrote from Hartlebury\r\nto his officials at Worcester, to the following effect:—\"Carefully\r\nconsidering and not without anxiety of heart often remembering how\r\ndangerously and excessively, alas, the burials have in these days,\r\nto our sorrow, increased, in the cemetery of our cathedral church at\r\nWorcester (for the great number of the dead in our days has never\r\nbeen equalled); and on this account, both for our brethren in the\r\nsaid church ministering devoutly to God and His most Glorious Mother,\r\nfor the citizens of the said city and others dwelling therein, and\r\nfor all others coming to the place, because of the various dangers\r\nwhich may probably await them from the corruption of the bodies, we\r\ndesire, as far as God shall grant us, to provide the best remedy.\r\nHaving deliberated over this, we have ordained, and do ordain, that\r\na place fit and proper for the purpose, namely, the cemetery of the\r\nhospital of St. Oswald, Worcester, be made to supply the deficiency\r\nin the said cemetery of our cathedral church arising from the\r\nsaid cause.\" He consequently orders that it be made known to the\r\nsacrist that all burials may at his discretion, \"in the time of this\r\nmortality, be made in the said cemetery of St. Oswald.\"[217]\r\n\r\nLeland mentions this cemetery in his Itinerary, where, speaking of\r\nthe \"long and fayre suburbe by north without the foregate,\" he says\r\nthere was a chapel to St. Oswald [p123] afterwards a hospital;\r\n\"but of later times it was turned to a free chapel, and beareth the\r\nname of Oswald, and here were wont corses to be buried in time of\r\npestilence as in a publicke cemitory for Worcester.\"[218]\r\n\r\nThe general state of the country parts in the county may be gauged by\r\nthe account given by the King's Escheator for Worcester at this time.\r\nThis officer, named Leo de Perton, was called upon, amongst other\r\nduties, to account for the receipts of the Bishop of Worcester's\r\nestates, from his death in August to the appointment of a successor\r\nat the end of November, 1349. The picture of the county generally\r\nwhich is presented in his reply is most distressing; tenants, he\r\nsays, could not be got at any price, mills were vacant, forges were\r\nstanding idle, pigeon houses were in ruins and the birds all gone,\r\nthe remnant of the people were everywhere giving up their holdings;\r\nthe harvest could not be gathered, nor, had this been possible, were\r\nthere any inhabitants left in the district to purchase the produce.\r\n\r\nComing to the particular case of the Bishop's temporalities, he\r\nclaims that of £140 supposed to be due, on the calculation of normal\r\nyears, so much as £84 was never received. For in that year, 1349, the\r\nautumn works of all kinds were not performed. \"On the divers manors\r\nof the said bishoprick they did not, and could not, obtain more than\r\nthey allowed, on account of the dearth of tenants, who were wont to\r\npay rent, and of customary tenants, who used to perform the said\r\nworks, but who had all died in the deadly pestilence, which raged in\r\nthe lands of the said bishoprick, during and before the date of the\r\nsaid account.\"\r\n\r\nIn the inquiry, the Escheator produced a letter from the [p124]\r\nKing,[219] saying that he had no wish that his official should\r\nbe charged more than he received. As a consequence of this, two\r\ncommissions were sent into the country to try, with a jury, the\r\nmatter at issue. The Escheator put in lists of tenants from whom\r\nalone he had received anything, and in the end the jury came to the\r\nconclusion that his statement was correct. The particulars disclose\r\nsome matters of considerable interest in the present inquiry. For\r\nexample, on the manor of Hartlebury there had been thirty-eight\r\ntenants called _virgates_, because each had farmed a virgate of land;\r\nthirteen called nokelonds, twenty-one called arkmen and four cottars,\r\nwho rendered certain services, valued at 106 shillings and 11-1/2d.\r\na year, including a custom called \"yardsilver.\" Nothing could be got\r\nof these services, \"because all the tenants had died in the mortal\r\nsickness, before the date of this account,\" and in the return of the\r\njury there are said to be only four tenants on the land paying 2s.\r\n10d.[220]\r\n\r\nThat this was not a mere passing difficulty appears certain when,\r\nsome years later, in 1354, the same Escheator asks for relief of £57\r\n15s. 5-1/4d., which he could not then obtain on the same estates,\r\nonce again in his hands, by the translation of the Bishop to another\r\nSee. Speaking of the work of the customary tenants, he says: \"That\r\nhe has not obtained, and could not obtain any of these, because the\r\nremnant of the said tenants had changed them into other services, and\r\nafter the plague, they were no longer bound to perform services of\r\nthis kind.\"[221]\r\n\r\nThe results in the neighbouring county of Warwick are naturally\r\nsimilar. With the counties of Gloucester and Worcester it formed the\r\nancient see of Worcester. The institutions of clergy in the county,\r\ngiven in Dugdale's _History of Warwickshire_, show that before April\r\nand after October only seven of such institutions [p125] were made,\r\nso that the pestilence was rife in the county in the summer months of\r\n1349, the institutions in the two months of June and July being the\r\nhighest.[222]\r\n\r\nIn some instances the changes were very rapid; thus at Ditchford\r\nFriary an incumbent came on July the 19th, and by August the 22nd\r\nhis successor was appointed. Kenilworth, too, was thrice vacant\r\nbetween May and August. At Coventry, on May 10th, Jordan Shepey, the\r\nMayor, \"who built the well called Jordan well,\" died.[223] In July\r\nthe archdeacon of Coventry and a chantry priest at Holy Trinity were\r\ncarried off. In August the Cathedral prior, John de Dunstable, was\r\nelected to fill the vacancy at the priory, and shortly after Trinity\r\nchurch had a new incumbent. At Pollesworth the abbess, Leticia de\r\nHexstall, died, and a successor was appointed on October 13th, 1349.\r\n\r\nIn Oxfordshire, which at the time of the great visitation of the\r\nplague, formed part of the large diocese of Lincoln, the number of\r\nbenefices, exclusive of the Oxford colleges, was some 220. Half this\r\nnumber consequently may be estimated as that of the deaths of the\r\nbeneficed clergy. The disease was probably prevalent in the county\r\nabout the same time as in the adjacent places—that is, in the spring\r\nand summer months of 1349. The prioress of Godstowe, for example,\r\ndied some time before May the 20th, on which day the royal permission\r\nwas given to elect a successor, and the prior of St. Frideswide,\r\nOxford, very much about the same time; since on June 1st Nicholas de\r\nHungerford received the temporalities upon his election.\r\n\r\nThe city of Oxford, with its large population of [p126] students,\r\nappears to have suffered terribly. \"Such a pestilence,\" writes Wood,\r\n\"that the like was never known before in Oxon. Those that had places\r\nand houses in the country retired (though overtaken there also),\r\nand those that were left behind were almost totally swept away. The\r\nschool doors were shut, colleges and halls relinquished, and none\r\nscarce left to keep possession, or make up a competent number to\r\nbury the dead. 'Tis reported that no less than 16 bodies in one day\r\nwere carried to one churchyard to be buried, so vehemently did it\r\nrage.\"[224] The celebrated FitzRalph, Archbishop of Armagh, who had\r\nbeen Chancellor of the University before the event, declares that\r\nin his time of office there were 30,000 students at Oxford.[225]\r\nIn this statement he is borne out by Gascoigne, who, writing his\r\n_Theological Dictionary_, in the reign of Henry VI., says: \"Before\r\nthe great plague in England there were few quarrels between the\r\npeople and law cases, and so there were also few lawyers in the\r\nkingdom of England and few in Oxford, when there were 30,000 scholars\r\nat Oxford, as I have seen on the rolls of the ancient Chancellors,\r\nwhen I was Chancellor there.\"[226] This concourse was diverted by the\r\npestilence, since in 1357 FitzRalph declares that there were not a\r\nthird of the old number at the schools.\r\n\r\nIn the year of the visitation Oxford had no fewer than three Mayors.\r\nRichard de Selwood died on the 21st April of this year, and the\r\nburgesses then made choice of [p127] Richard de Cary. Before he\r\ncould reach London to take the oath to the King he was taken sick,\r\nand the abbot of Osney was named as Commissioner to attend at Oxford\r\nand administer the oath of office to him. On May 19th the abbot\r\ncertified that he had done this, but on the 16th of June, letters\r\ndated from Oxford two days previously were received in London\r\nannouncing the Mayor's death and the election of John Dereford in his\r\nplace.[227]\r\n\r\nWithout doubt Oxford had its plague pit like other cities. The late\r\nProfessor Thorold Rogers, writing about this pestilence, says: \"I\r\nhave no doubt that the principal place of burial for Oxford victims\r\nwas at some part of New College garden, for when Wykeham bought\r\nthe site it appears to have been one which had been previously\r\npopulous, but was deserted some thirty years before during the\r\nplague and apparently made a burial ground by the survivors of the\r\ncalamity.\"[228]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[205] At p. 92 of the printed edition of this chronicle the author\r\ndescribes the breaking out of the plague in France, just after the\r\ntaking of Calais by the English. He attributes the truce between the\r\nFrench and the English to the epidemic.\r\n\r\n[206] _Chronicon Galfridi Le Baker de Swynebroke_, ed. E. M.\r\nThompson, pp. 98-9.\r\n\r\n[207] R.

The epidemic was at its height in the East of\r\nEngland in the summer months of 1349,[230] and the deaths in the\r\nranks of the clergy were very alarming. The average number of\r\ninstitutions in the diocese yearly for five years before the sickness\r\nwas seventy-seven. In this single year 800 parishes lost their\r\nincumbents, 83 of them twice, and ten three times, in a few months;\r\nand by the close of the year two-thirds of the benefices in the\r\ndiocese had become vacant.\r\n\r\nOf the seven convents of women in this district, five lost their\r\nsuperiors, and in at least twelve of the religious houses of men,\r\nincluding the abbey of St. Benet's Hulme, the head died. How many of\r\nthe subjects in these 19 monastic establishments were carried off by\r\nthe sickness [p129] can never be known; but bearing in mind what was\r\nremarked at the time, that the disease hardly ever entered a house\r\nwithout claiming many victims, and what we know of other places of\r\nwhich there is definite information, the suspicion may be allowed\r\nthat the roll of the dead in the religious houses of East Anglia\r\nwas very large. At Heveringland the prior and canons died to a man,\r\nand at Hickling only one survived; neither house ever recovered. In\r\nthe college of St. Mary-in-the-Fields, at Norwich, five out of the\r\nseven prebendaries were carried off, whilst the Friars of our Lady,\r\nin the same city, are all said to have died. Altogether, Dr. Jessopp\r\ncalculates that some 2,000 clergy in the diocese must have been\r\ncarried off by the disease in a few months.\r\n\r\nFrom the court rolls the same evidence is adduced for the terrible\r\nmortality among the people. Dr. Jessopp had collected many striking\r\nproofs of this, from which one or two examples may be quoted. On a\r\nmanor called Cornard Parva there were about 50 tenants. On 31st March\r\nthree men and six women are registered as having died in two months.\r\nDuring the next month 15 men and women, seven without heirs, were\r\ncarried off, and by 3rd November there are 36 more deaths recorded,\r\nand of these 13 have left no relations. Thus during the incidence of\r\nthe plague some 21 families on this one manor had disappeared. The\r\npriest of the place had died in September.[231]\r\n\r\nTo take another example. At Hunstanton on the 16th of October,\r\n1349, it was found that in two months 63 men and 15 women had been\r\ncarried off. In 31 instances only women and children had been left\r\nto succeed, and in nine there were no known heirs. In this small\r\nparish, and in only eight months, 172 persons who were tenants of the\r\nmanor had died. Of these, 74 had left no heirs male, and 19 no blood\r\nrelations at all.[232]\r\n\r\nTo these examples may be added one taken from the [p130] court\r\nroll of the manor of Snetterton, about the centre of the county of\r\nNorfolk. A court of the manor was held on Saturday in the feast of\r\nSt. James the Apostle, that is July 25th, 1349, and it is called\r\nominously the _Curia pestilencie_, the Court of the Plague. At this\r\nmeeting 39 tenants of the manor are named as having died, and in\r\nmany cases no heir is forthcoming. One tenant is specially named as\r\nholding his house and ten acres on condition of keeping three lamps\r\never burning before the Blessed Sacrament in the parish church. He is\r\ndead and has left no other relation, but a son 16 years of age.\r\n\r\nThe larger cities of East Anglia, such as Norwich and Yarmouth,\r\nsuffered no less than the country districts from the all-pervading\r\nplague. The historian of Norfolk has estimated the population of\r\nNorwich before this catastrophe at 70,000.[233] It was unquestionably\r\none of the most flourishing cities of England, and possessed some 60\r\nparish churches, seven conventual establishments, as well as other\r\nchurches in the suburbs; and on the authority of an ancient record in\r\nthe Guildhall, Blomefield put down the number of those carried off\r\nby the epidemic at 57,374. Such a number has been considered by many\r\nas altogether impossible, but that the city was reduced considerably\r\ndoes not appear open to doubt in view of the fact that by 1368 ten\r\nparishes had disappeared and fourteen more were subsequently found\r\nto be useless. \"The ruins of twenty of these,\" says a modern writer,\r\n\"may still be seen.\"[234]\r\n\r\nYarmouth in the middle of the fourteenth century was a most\r\nflourishing port. When, to assist the attack of Edward on Calais,\r\nbut two years before the plague, London furnished 25 ships and\r\n662 mariners, Yarmouth is said to have sent 43 ships and 1,950\r\nsailors.[235] William of Worcester, in his Itinerary, after speaking\r\nin praise of the town, says: \"In the [p131] great pestilence there\r\ndied 7,000 people.\"[236] This statement is probably based upon the\r\nnumber of persons buried in one churchyard. For in a petition of\r\nburgesses of Yarmouth in the beginning of the sixteenth century to\r\nHenry VII. it is asserted that the prosperous condition of the town\r\nwas destroyed by the great plagues during the reign of Edward III. In\r\nthe thirty-first year of this reign, they say,—probably mistaking the\r\nyear—7,052 people were buried in their churchyard, \"by reason whereof\r\nthe most part of the dwelling-places and inhabitations of the said\r\ntown stood desolate and fell into utter ruin and decay, which at this\r\nday are gardens and void grounds, as it evidently appeared.\"\r\n\r\nIt is, moreover, certain that Yarmouth Church, large as it appears\r\nin these days, was, before the plague of 1349, not ample enough for\r\nthe population,[237] and preparations had already been made for\r\nconsiderably enlarging its nave. Owing to the pestilence the work was\r\nnot carried out. Nor is this the only instance in the county where\r\nthe enlargement of churches already vast was rendered unnecessary by\r\nthe diminution of inhabitants through the sickness. It is impossible\r\nto examine the great churches which abound in the counties of Norfolk\r\nand Suffolk without coming to the conclusion that they were built to\r\nserve the purposes of a large population.\r\n\r\nTo take one example, the tax on the town of Dunwich had been granted\r\nby the King to the monastery of Ely; but in 1351 the inhabitants\r\npetitioned for relief as they were quite unable to find the money\r\nfor the royal collectors. The King gave way to what he calls \"the\r\nrelation of the men of the town of Dunwich,\" which recited that\r\n\"the said town, which before this time was completely inhabited by\r\nfisher-folk, had been rendered desolate by the deadly plague late\r\nraging in those parts, and by our enemies the [p132] French seizing\r\nand killing the fishermen at sea, and still remained so.\"[238]\r\n\r\nFrom Norfolk and Suffolk we pass to the adjoining county of\r\nCambridge, which is conterminous with the diocese of Ely. The Bishop\r\nof the diocese, Thomas de Lisle, was abroad at the time when the\r\nplague broke out in the county. On the 19th of May he wrote to the\r\nclergy of his diocese, forwarding the letter of Stephen, Archbishop\r\nof Arles, and Chamberlain of the Pope, already referred to elsewhere.\r\nBy this anyone was empowered to choose his own confessor, \"since in\r\nall places now is, or will be, the epidemic or mortality of people\r\nwhich at present rages in most parts of the world.\"[239] The Bishop\r\nhad made arrangements for the government of his see during his\r\nabsence abroad, but on April 9th, 1349, he wrote from Rome, making\r\nother dispositions in view of the plague. \"By reason of the epidemic,\r\nas it is called, wonderfully increasing in the diocese,\" as he has\r\nlately understood by people from thence, he, \"for fear his former\r\nVicars General should die,\" augments their number. And, further,\r\n\"considering how difficult it is for two people to agree about the\r\nsame sentence, he appoints John, prior of Barnwell, singly and solely\r\nto dispose of all vacant benefices, and in case of his death, or\r\nrefusal to act, then Master Walter de Peckham, LL.D., to be sole\r\ndisposer of them,\" and then six others in order; a provision which\r\nitself shows how slight he considered the chance of life for any\r\nindividual. In other matters any of his Vicars General could act;\r\nand \"in case of any death putting a stop to business, as was likely\r\nin such a mortality,\" whichever Vicar General was present should act\r\nuntil the arrival of the three specially appointed.[240]\r\n\r\nThe foresight of the Bishop was not unnecessary. From [p133] the\r\nmonth of April vacancies followed quickly one upon another. For three\r\nyears previous to 1349 the average number of institutions recorded\r\nin the episcopal registers was nine, and in 1348 it was only seven.\r\nIn this year of the great sickness 97 appointments to livings in the\r\ndiocese were made by the Bishop's Vicars, and in July alone there\r\nwere 25.[241] The prior of Barnwell died early in the course of the\r\nsickness, probably even before he could have received the Bishop's\r\ncommission to act for him in the matter of vacant benefices.\r\n\r\nIn June there are evidences of the mortality in the Cathedral priory\r\nof Ely. On the 23rd of the month John de Co, Chancellor of the\r\ndiocese, acting as the Bishop's representative, according to the\r\ncommission, appointed a new sub-prior to the monastery, and again\r\non July the 2nd a cellarer and camerarius. A week later, on the 9th\r\nof July, 1349, \"brother Philip Dallyng, late sacrist of Ely, being\r\ndead, and the said brother Paulinus (the camerarius) being likewise\r\ndead and both of them buried, he appointed to both offices, namely,\r\nbrother Adam de Lynsted as sacrist, and brother John of St. Ives\r\nas camerarius.\"[242] At the same time also two chantries in the\r\nCathedral became vacant; one, called \"the green chantry,\" twice in\r\ntwo months.\r\n\r\nThe number of clergy carried away by the sickness in this diocese\r\nmay be estimated from the number of vacant benefices. Deducting\r\nthe average number of yearly [p134] institutions, it is fair to\r\nconsider that 89 priests holding benefices died at this time.[243]\r\nThe proportion of non-beneficed clergy to those beneficed was then\r\nprobably about the same as it was in the second year of King Richard\r\nII. The clerical subsidy for that time shows 140 beneficed clergy\r\nagainst 508 non-beneficed, including the various religious.[244] On\r\nthis basis at least 350 of the clerical order must have perished in\r\nthe diocese of Ely.\r\n\r\nThe University town of Cambridge did not escape. On May 24th, 1349,\r\nthe church of St. Sepulchre's fell vacant, and already in July\r\nseveral of the churches were without incumbents. Towards the end of\r\nApril the Master of the hospital of St. John died, and one Robert de\r\nSpronston was appointed to succeed. Then he died a short time after,\r\nand one Roger de Broom was instituted on May 24th; but in his turn\r\nRoger died, and another took his place.\r\n\r\nCambridge, too, had probably its common plague pit. \"Some years ago,\"\r\nwrites the late Professor Thorold Rogers, \"being at Cambridge while\r\nthe foundations of the new Divinity School were being laid, I saw\r\nthat the ground was full of skeletons, thrown in without any attempt\r\nat order, and I divined that this must have been a Cambridge plague\r\npit.\"[245]\r\n\r\nA curious document preserved in the Bishop's archives shows how\r\nseverely some parishes must have suffered. It is a consent given by\r\nthe prior and convent of Ely to a proposal of the Bishop to unite\r\ntwo parishes in Cambridge. It mentions the churches of All Saints'\r\nand St. Giles', of Cambridge, near the castle, and states that the\r\nparishioners of the former are, for the most part, dead in the\r\npestilence, [p135] and those that had been left alive had gone to\r\nthe parishes of other churches. It also says that the people of St.\r\nGiles' have died, and, further, that the nave of All Saints' is in\r\na ruinous state, \"and the bones of the dead exposed to beasts.\" The\r\nBishop consequently proposes to unite these two ancient parishes of\r\nCambridge, and in this consent to the proposal a glimpse is almost\r\naccidentally afforded of the desolation wrought in the University\r\ntown by the terrible scourge.[246]\r\n\r\nAn example of what was probably very general throughout the county\r\nis afforded by a roll of accounts for a Cambridgeshire manor in this\r\nyear. Considerable decay of rents is noted, and no wonder, for it\r\nwould seem that 50 tenements and 22 cottages were in hand, and that\r\nthe services which the holders would otherwise have rendered have to\r\nbe paid for. At Easter 13 copyholders' tenements are vacant, and by\r\nPentecost another 30 are added to the long list.[247]\r\n\r\nThe clergy were reduced to the greatest straits in consequence of\r\nthe deaths among their parishioners, leading to a proportional\r\ndiminution of their incomes. On September 20th, 1349, the Bishop's\r\nVicar addressed a letter to John Lynot, vicar of All Saints', Jury,\r\nCambridge.[248] \"We are informed,\" he says, \"by your frequent\r\ncomplaint that the portion coming to you in the said church is known\r\nto consist only of offerings of the parishioners, and that the same\r\nparishioners have been so swept away by the plague notoriously\r\nraging in this year that the offerings of the said church do not\r\nsuffice for the necessities of life, and that you cannot elsewhere\r\nobtain help to bear the burden laid upon you. On this account you\r\nhave humbly petitioned [p136] us to be allowed to have for two\r\nyears an anniversary (mass) for your necessary support. Since your\r\nposition in God's Church does not make it fitting that you should\r\nseek alms, particularly for necessities in food and clothing, we\r\ngrant you the permission asked on the condition that as soon as the\r\nfruit and revenue of the said portion be sufficient to properly\r\nfurnish you with necessaries you altogether give up the income of\r\nthis anniversary (mass).\"[249] At the same time a similar permission\r\nwas granted to John Atte Welle, vicar of St. John, \"in Melnstreet,\"\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\nThe adjoining county of Huntingdon forms a portion of the great\r\ndiocese of Lincoln. In it there were some 95 benefices, which may\r\ngive some indication of the probable number of deaths in the ranks of\r\nthe clergy of the county.\r\n\r\nThe abbot of Ramsey died on the 10th of June, 1349, and the King\r\ndid not, as usual, claim the temporalities during the vacancy, but\r\nallowed the monks to pay a smaller sum than was usual; \"and, be it\r\nremembered,\" says the document allowing this, \"that because of the\r\ndepression of the said abbey by the present mortal pestilence raging\r\nin the country, the said custody is granted to the prior and convent\r\nfor a lesser sum to pay to the King than at the time of the last\r\nvacancy.\"[250]\r\n\r\nAmong the _Inquisitiones post mortem_ is one relating to the manor\r\nof Caldecot, in Huntingdonshire. It formed part of the estates of\r\nMargaret, Countess of Kent, who died on St. Michael's day, 1349.\r\nMany houses of the manor are represented as ruinous, and of no\r\nvalue. Rents of assize, formerly worth £8 a year, this time produced\r\nbut fifty shillings; an old mill, which hitherto had been let with\r\n[p137] land for two pounds a year, is now only worth 6s. 8d.,\r\n\"because of the pestilence it could be let at no higher rate.\" And,\r\nlastly, the fees of the manor court had sunk from 13s. 4d. to 3s. 4d.\r\n\"through dearth of tenants there.\"[251]\r\n\r\nProceeding westward from Huntingdonshire, the county of Northampton\r\nnext claims attention. Judged by the lists of institutions given in\r\nBridges' history of the county, there were changes at this period\r\nin 131 instances out of 281. In fifteen cases two or more changes\r\noccurred in the same place in 1349, and the number of institutions\r\nwas greatest in August, when 36 appointments were made.[252] From\r\nthe institutions it appears likely that the town of Northampton was\r\nattacked most severely about the October of the year 1349; at least,\r\non November the 1st two appointments were made to livings there.\r\n\r\nAs to the religious houses, at Luffield all are said to have died of\r\nthe plague. William de Skelton, the prior, was carried off by the\r\nsickness, and the rental of the house was subsequently declared to be\r\ninadequate for its support. At Delaprey Convent, Catherine Knyvet,\r\nthe abbess, fell a victim to the disease. At Worthorp, the superior,\r\nEmma de Pinchbeck, died, and probably many of the Augustinian nuns\r\nthere. The Bishop appointed Agnes Bowes to succeed, but the convent\r\nnever recovered, and in 1354 was, at the petition of its patron\r\nSir Thomas Holland, [p138] united to the convent of St. Michael\r\nnear Stamford. In the royal licence it is stated \"that the convent,\r\nbeing poorly endowed, was, by the pestilence which lately prevailed,\r\nreduced to such poverty that all the nuns but one, on account of\r\ntheir penury, had dispersed.\"[253]\r\n\r\nThe inquiry just referred to, as to the estates of the Countess of\r\nKent upon her death in 1349, reports as to the state of a manor in\r\nNorthamptonshire. It is the same tale of depression and desolation as\r\nappears everywhere else throughout England. Pasture formerly worth\r\nforty shillings now yields only ten, and some even brought in only\r\nfive shillings in place of eighteen; and the sole reason assigned is\r\n\"the mortality.\" A water mill and a wind mill \"for the same cause\"\r\nwas let for 6s. 8d., instead of the old 56 shillings.\r\n\r\nThe priory of Stamford itself moreover was in sad distress. The\r\nrents from five free tenants and eighteen customary tenants, were\r\njust one-third of their former value \"for the same cause.\" And the\r\nsame nuns, in place of 19s. 8d. which they used to get for thirteen\r\ntenements, now received only four shillings, whilst their yearly\r\ntenants, who should pay 13lbs. of pepper, at 12d. the pound, have\r\npaid nothing; moreover the fines of the manor, estimated to produce\r\ntwenty shillings a year, have brought in but two.\r\n\r\nA third example is given in the case of a manor near Blisworth, in\r\nwhich two mills are let for twenty, in place of the old rent of\r\nsixty-five shillings; and two carucates of land produced only some\r\nfifteen shillings the carucate, \"and not more, on account of the\r\nmortality in those parts.\"[254]\r\n\r\nOf the small county of Rutland, lying at the north of\r\nNorthamptonshire, little can be said. It likewise formed part of\r\nthe diocese of Lincoln, and contained some 57 benefices. From an\r\ninquisition we learn that on one manor for nine virgates of land\r\nthere could be estimated [p139] nothing in the way of rent, \"because\r\nall the tenants died before the feast of Easter (1349). They (_i.e._,\r\nthe jury) also say that the natives and cottars did not work this\r\nyear.\" In another place, a house and garden formerly let for forty\r\nshillings, now produces only twenty shillings; 240 acres of arable\r\nland are let for half their former value, and 180 acres of meadow are\r\nworth 10d. per acre, in place of eighteen-pence.[255]\r\n\r\nEastward, the county adjoining Northampton is Leicester. For this\r\ncounty there exists the local account of Knighton, a canon of\r\nLeicester abbey. As far as concerns England his relation may fitly\r\nfind a place here. \"The sorrow-bearing pestilence,\" he writes,\r\n\"entered the sea coast at Southampton, and came to Bristol, and\r\nalmost the whole strength of the town died as if struck with sudden\r\ndeath, for there were few who kept their beds beyond three or two\r\ndays or even half a day. Then the terrible death rolled on into all\r\nparts according to the course of the sun, and at Leicester, in the\r\nlittle parish of St. Leonard, there died more than 380; in the parish\r\nof Holy Cross more than 400; in that of St. Margaret, Leicester, more\r\nthan 700; and so in every parish great numbers.\r\n\r\n\"The Bishop of Lincoln sent through his diocese a general power to\r\nall and every priest, both regular and secular, to hear confessions\r\nand to absolve with full and entire episcopal power, except only in\r\nthe case of debt. In that case, if able (the penitent) himself was to\r\nmake satisfaction whilst he lived, or at least others should do so\r\nwith his property, after his death. In the same way the Pope granted\r\na full remission from all sins, to be obtained once only by every one\r\nin danger of death, and he allowed this faculty to last till the next\r\nEaster following, and each to choose at will his own confessor.\r\n\r\n\"In the same year, there was a great mortality of sheep everywhere in\r\nthe kingdom; so much so, that in one place [p140] there died in one\r\npasture more than 5,000 sheep, and they were so putrid that neither\r\nbeast nor bird would touch them. The price for everything was low;\r\nthrough fear of death, very few cared for riches and the like. And\r\nthen a man could purchase a horse for half a mark, which before had\r\nbeen worth forty shillings; a large fat ox for 4s.; a cow for 12d.;\r\na bullock for 6d.; a fat wether for 4d.; a sheep for 3d.; a lamb for\r\n2d.; a large pig for 5d.; and a stone of wool for nine pence; and\r\nsheep and cattle roamed about, wandering in fields and through the\r\ngrowing harvest, and there was no one to drive them off or collect\r\nthem; but in ditches and thickets they died in innumerable quantities\r\nin every part, for lack of guardians; for so great a dearth of\r\nservants and labourers existed that no one knew what to do. Memory\r\ncould not recall so universal and terrible a mortality since the time\r\nof Vortigern, king of the Britons, in whose reign, as Bede in his 'De\r\ngestis Anglorum' testifies, the living did not suffice to bury the\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n\"In the following autumn no one could get a harvester at a lower\r\nprice than eight pence with food. For this reason many crops perished\r\nin the fields for lack of those to gather them; but in the year of\r\nthe pestilence, as said above of other things, there was such an\r\nabundance of crops of all kinds that no one, as it were, cared for\r\nthem.\"[256]\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any definite information as to the institutions\r\nmade at this time in the county of Leicester it is only necessary\r\nto note that the number of benefices was about 250 at this period.\r\nThere were also some twelve religious houses and several hospitals.\r\nIn 1351, as we learn from the records, Croxton abbey still \"remained\r\nquite deserted.\" The church and many of the buildings had been burnt,\r\nand \"by the pestilence the abbey was entirely deprived of those by\r\nwhose ability the monastery was then administered\" (the abbot and\r\nprior alone excepted). [p141] The abbot was sick, \"and the said\r\nprior (in November, 1351) was fully occupied in the conduct of the\r\nDivine Office and the instruction of the novices received there into\r\nthe community, after the pestilence.\"[257]\r\n\r\nA slight confirmation of Knighton's account of the distress in the\r\ncountry parts after the plague had passed, if any were needed, is\r\nfound in an inquisition made upon the death of Isabella, wife of\r\nWilliam de Botereaux, who died upon St. James' Day, 1349. The manor\r\nheld by her was at a place called Sadington, in Leicestershire, and\r\ntwo carucates of land are represented as lying uncultivated and waste\r\n\"through the want of tenants.\"[258]\r\n\r\nThe adjoining county of Staffordshire formed part of the diocese of\r\nCoventry and Lichfield. It comprised 165 benefices, which may form\r\nsome basis on which to calculate in estimating the number of clergy\r\nwho were carried off by the pestilence. Some lands in this county,\r\nnear Tamworth, belonged to the Earl of Pembroke. Upon his death,\r\nwhilst the heir was a minor, they were farmed out at a rent of £38\r\nper annum, to be paid to the King. In 1351 the man who had agreed to\r\npay that sum petitioned to have it reduced, because \"the tenements\r\nwith the said land so let are so deteriorated by the pestilential\r\nmortality lately raging in those parts that they do not reach their\r\nwonted value.\" After inquiry, his rent is reduced by £8 the year.[259]\r\n\r\nOf the two counties bordering upon Wales, Hereford and Shropshire,\r\nnot much is known at this time. There can be little doubt, however,\r\nthat they suffered quite as severely from the epidemic as the other\r\ncounties of England.\r\n\r\nIn the diocese of Hereford, including that county and a portion of\r\nShropshire, the average number of institutions to benefices, during\r\nthree years before and after the epidemic, was some 13. In 1349\r\nthere are recorded in [p142] Bishop Trileck's register no fewer\r\nthan 175 institutions, and in the following year the number of 45\r\nvacant benefices filled up, points to the fact that many livings had\r\nprobably remained for some months without incumbents. This suspicion\r\nis further strengthened by the frequent appearance of the words \"by\r\nlapse\" in the record of institutions at this period, which shows\r\nthat for six months the living had not been filled by the patron. It\r\nis probable, therefore, that in the diocese of Hereford about 200\r\nbeneficed clergy fell victims to the disease. Taking the dates of the\r\ninstitutions as some indication of the period when the epidemic was\r\nmost severe in the diocese, it would appear that the worst time was\r\nfrom May to September, 1349.[260]\r\n\r\nOne fact bearing upon the subject of the great mortality in the\r\npestilence of 1349 in the county of Hereford is recorded in the\r\nepiscopal register. In 1352 the Bishop united into one parish the two\r\nchurches of Great Colington and Little Colington, about four miles\r\nfrom Bromyard. The patrons of the two livings agreed to support a\r\npetition of the parishes to this effect, and in it they say \"that the\r\nsore calamity of pestilence of men lately passed, which ravaged the\r\nwhole world in every part, has so reduced the number of the people\r\nof the said churches, and for that said reason there followed, and\r\nstill exists, such a paucity of labourers and other inhabitants, such\r\nmanifest sterility of the lands, and such notorious poverty in the\r\nsaid parishes, that the parishioners and receipts of both churches\r\nscarcely suffice to support one priest.\"[261] The single church\r\n[p143] of Colington remains to this day as a memorial of the great\r\nmortality in that district. Even among the inhabitants the memory of\r\nthe two Colingtons has apparently been lost.\r\n\r\nIn Salop the historians of the county town record that \"through all\r\nthese appalling scenes (consequent upon the great mortality of 1349)\r\nthe zeal of the clergy, both secular and monastic, was honourably\r\ndistinguished. The episcopal registers of the diocese, within which\r\nShrewsbury is situated, bear a like honourable testimony to the\r\nassiduity of the secular clergy of the district.\"[262] From the\r\nsame source it appears that the average number of institutions to\r\nbenefices vacant by death during ten years before 1349 and ten years\r\nafter are only 1-1/2 per annum, or 15 for the whole period. In that\r\nyear the number of institutions to vacancies known to have been\r\ncaused by _death_ was 29. If this number be taken as a guide for the\r\ngeneral mortality, Shropshire would appear to have suffered in an\r\nexceptional manner. Besides these, however, there are a number of\r\nother institutions registered at this time, the cause of which is not\r\nspecified, and many of them most probably were also caused by the\r\ngreat epidemic.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the general destitution caused by the great\r\nsickness, Owen and Blakeway quote an _Inquisitio post mortem_, taken\r\nin the year of the plague, upon the estate of a Shropshire gentleman,\r\nJohn le Strange of Blakmere. By that record he is found by the jury\r\nto have died, seized with various lands, etc., amongst others, the\r\nthree watermills, \"which used to be worth by the year 20 marks, but\r\nnow they are worth only half that sum, by reason of the want of\r\nthose grinding, on account of the pestilence.\" The same cause is\r\nassigned for the diminution of other parts of his revenue, as tolls\r\non markets, rent of assize, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the manor of Dodinton, proceeds the record of the inquiry,\r\n\"there are two carucates of land which used to be [p144] worth\r\nyearly sixty shillings, and now the said jurors know not how to\r\nvalue the said land, because the domestic and labouring servants\r\n(_famuli et servientes_) are dead, and no one is willing to hire\r\nthe land.\" The water-mill has sunk in value from thirty shillings\r\nto six-and-eightpence, because the tenants are dead; the pond was\r\nvalueless since the fish had been taken out, and it had not been\r\nstocked again.[263]\r\n\r\nThis John le Strange, of Whitchurch, died on August 20th, 1349, and\r\nthe inquisition held upon his estates names three sons—Fulk, the\r\neldest, who was married; Humphrey, the second; and John, who was 17\r\nyears of age; and it notes that if Fulk were to die then Humphrey\r\nhis brother was the heir. The inquiry was held upon August 30th,\r\nten days after the death of John, and at this very time when Fulk\r\nwas thus declared to be the heir he had himself been dead two days.\r\nApparently also Humphrey was carried off by the sickness as well;\r\nbecause in the inquisition subsequently held upon the estate of Fulk,\r\nJohn, the third brother, is named as the heir. In this inquiry the\r\njury bear out the declarations of that which had testified to the\r\ncondition of the estates upon the death of the father. On one manor\r\nit is stated that the rent of assize, which used to be £20, is now\r\nonly forty shillings, and the court fees have fallen from forty to\r\nfive shillings, \"because the tenants there are dead.\" And in another\r\nShropshire hamlet the rent of assize, formerly £4, was now \"from the\r\nsaid cause\" only eight shillings.[264]\r\n\r\nNorth of a line drawn from the Wash to the Dee, the four counties of\r\nChester, Derby, Nottingham, and Lincoln stretch across England from\r\nwest and east. A brief record of the pestilence in each of these\r\ncounties is all that need be here given. In its main lines, and,\r\nindeed, almost in its every detail, the story of one county is that\r\nof every [p145] other, and it is only by chance that the account of\r\ndefinite incidents has been preserved.\r\n\r\nThe benefices in the county of Chester numbered some 70. In the\r\nfour months June, July, August, and September thirty institutions\r\nare entered in the registers of Coventry and Lichfield for the\r\narchdeaconry of Chester alone. The most numerous are in the month\r\nof September.[265] The non-beneficed clergy are, of course, not\r\nincluded in this number; and in the city alone, at the end of Edward\r\nthe Third's reign, there were at least fifty or sixty of this class.\r\nIn one parish, for example, that of St. John by the Riverside, there\r\nwere nine non-beneficed vicars and six chaplains.[266] In August a\r\nnew prioress was installed at St. Mary's, Chester, and a new prior at\r\nNorton.\r\n\r\nFrom the ministers' accounts for the County Palatine of Chester, at\r\nthis period, some facts can be gleaned as to the general state of\r\ndesolation to which the great sickness reduced it. Thus, in the manor\r\nof Frodsham, the bailiff returns the receipt of only twenty shillings\r\nrent for the lands of the manor farm, \"received for 66 animals\r\nfeeding on them.\" He adds, \"and not more this year, because he could\r\nget no tenants by reason of the pestilence.\" Further he notes the\r\ngeneral prices as being low, and names a mill and a bakehouse that\r\ncannot be let. As an instance of the decay of rent it is noted that\r\nin the town of Netherton, more than a year after the plague had\r\nceased, eleven houses and a great quantity of land, which fell into\r\nthe hands of the lord in the last year through the pestilence, remain\r\nyet in his hands;\" the same also is remarked of other townships, and\r\nin one place the miller had been allowed a reduction in his rent on\r\naccount of the way his business had fallen off since the disease.[267]\r\n\r\nIn the same way on another manor, that of Bucklow, at Michaelmas\r\n1350, it is stated that 215 acres of arable land [p146] are lying\r\nwaste, \"for which no tenants can be found through the pestilence,\r\nwhich had visited the place the previous year. Further, those who\r\nhad held a portion of the manor land during the last year had given\r\ntheir holdings up at the feast of St. Michael at the beginning of the\r\naccount (_i.e._, 1349). On the same estate the rent of a garden was\r\nput down at only 12d., because there was no one to buy the produce.\r\nOne of the largest receipts was 3s. 6d., paid by one Margery del\r\nHoles, \"for the turf of divers tenants of the manor who had died in\r\nthe time of the pestilence.\" On the whole of the estate there is\r\nrepresented to be a decrease of £20 9s. 2-3/4d. in the rent of this\r\nyear, and a good part of the deficit is accounted for by the fact\r\nthat 34 tenants owe various sums, but cannot pay as they have nothing\r\nbut their crops, and that 46 of the tenants had been carried off by\r\nthe epidemic.\r\n\r\nOn the estate, moreover, it is not uninteresting to note that a\r\nportion—no less, indeed, than a third part—of the rent was remitted\r\nat this time. The remission, however, hardly appears to have been\r\nmade willingly, but in consequence of a threat on the part of the\r\nholders of the manor lands that unless it was granted they would\r\nleave. This is noted upon the roll: \"In money remitted to the tenants\r\nof Rudheath (some four miles from Northwich) by the Justices of\r\nChester and others, by the advice of the lord, for the third part of\r\ntheir rent by reason of the plague which had been raging, because the\r\ntenants there wished to depart and leave the holdings on the lord's\r\nhands, unless they obtained this remission until the world do come\r\nbetter again, and the holdings possess a greater value . . . £10 13s.\r\n11-3/4d.\"[268]\r\n\r\nEastward the adjoining county is Derbyshire. An examination of the\r\ninstitutions for this county has been made by the Rev. Dr. Cox for\r\nhis work on the _Churches of Derbyshire_. The result of his studies\r\nmay here be [p147] given almost in his words. In May, 1349, there\r\nis evidence that the plague had reached Derbyshire. At that period\r\nthe total number of benefices in the county was 108, and the average\r\nnumber of institutions registered yearly during the century was only\r\nseven. In 1346 the actual number had been but four, in 1347 only two,\r\nand in 1348 it was eight. In the year of the plague, 1349, no fewer\r\nthan sixty-three institutions to vacant benefices are registered, and\r\n\"in the following year (many of the vacant benefices not being filled\r\nup till then) they numbered forty-one.\" In this period seventy-seven\r\nof the beneficed clergy died; that is considerably more than half the\r\ntotal number, and twenty-two more resigned their livings.\r\n\r\n\"Of the three vicars of Derby churches two died, whilst the third\r\nresigned. The chantry priest of Our Lady at St. Peter's Church also\r\ndied. The two rectors of Eckington both died, and of the three\r\nrectors who then shared the rectory of Derley two died and one\r\nresigned. The rectories of Langwith and Mugginton, and the vicarages\r\nof Barlborough, Bolsover, Horsley, Longford, Sutton-on-the-Hill, and\r\nWillington were twice emptied by the plague, and three successive\r\nvicars of Pentrich all fell in the same fatal year. Nor were the\r\nregular clergy more fortunate, for the abbots of Beauchief, Dale, and\r\nDerley, the prior of Gresley, the prior of the Dominicans at Derby,\r\nand the prioress of King's Mead, were all taken.\"[269]\r\n\r\nThe same author has called attention to some obituary notes in the\r\ncalendar prefixed to the Chartulary of Derley abbey.\r\n\r\n\"A glance at this obituary,\" he says, \"is sufficient to draw the\r\nattention of the reader to the remarkable number of deaths in the\r\nyear 1349. . . . Of the character of the plague we can form some idea\r\nwhen we consider the extent of its ravages in a single household—a\r\nhousehold the most wealthy of the neighbourhood, and situated in as\r\n[p148] healthy and uncrowded a spot as any that could be found on\r\nall the fair hillsides of Derbyshire. Within three months Sir William\r\nde Wakebridge lost his father, his wife, three brothers, two sisters,\r\nand a sister-in-law. Sir William, on succeeding to the Wakebridge\r\nestate, through this sad list of fatalities, appears to have\r\nabandoned the profession of arms and to have devoted a very large\r\nshare of his wealth to the service of God in his own neighbourhood.\r\nThe great plague had the effect of thoroughly unstringing the\r\nconsciences of many of the survivors, and a lamentable outbreak of\r\nprofligacy was the result.\"\r\n\r\nThe accounts for the Lordship of Drakelow, some four miles from\r\nBurton-on-Trent, may be taken as a sample of what must have been the\r\ncase elsewhere. There is noted a loss, to begin with, \"upon turf sold\r\nfrom the waste of the manor to tenants who had died in the time of\r\nthe pestilence.\" The decrease of rent is very considerable. From \"the\r\ncustoms of the manor there is nothing, because all these tenants died\r\nin the time of the plague.\" Then follow the names of seventy-four\r\ntenants, from all of whom only 13s. 9-3/4d. had been received in the\r\nperiod covered by the account, and practically from the entire manor\r\nthere had been no receipt except for grass. Then, instead of the\r\nharvest being gathered in, as before it had been, by means of the\r\nservices of the tenants, this year paid-labour had to be employed at\r\na cost of £22 18s. 10d. On the receipt side of the account appear the\r\nvalues of the cows, oxen, and horses of tenants who had died, and\r\nwhose goods and animals passed into the possession of the lord of the\r\nmanor.[270]\r\n\r\nIn Nottinghamshire the proportion of deaths among the beneficed\r\nclergy is found, as in other cases, to be fully one-half the total\r\nnumber. Out of 126 benefices in the county the incumbent died in\r\nsixty-five.[271]\r\n\r\nEastwards, again, the county of Lincoln lies between [p149]\r\nNottinghamshire and the sea. At an early period Pope Clement VI.\r\ngranted to the priests and people of the city and diocese of Lincoln\r\ngreat indulgences at the hour of death, \"since on their behalf\r\na petition had been made to him which declared that the deadly\r\npestilence had commenced in the said city and diocese.\"[272] The\r\nextent of the county is large, and its endowed livings numerous. In\r\nall, not including its forty-nine monasteries, the beneficed clergy\r\nof the county numbered some 700, and from this some estimate may be\r\nformed of the probable number of clerics who died in Lincolnshire in\r\nthe year 1349.\r\n\r\nThe chronicle of Louth Park, a Cistercian abbey in the county,\r\ncontains a brief note upon the epidemic. \"This plague,\" it says,\r\n\"laid low equally Jew, Christian, and Saracen; together it carried\r\noff confessor and penitent. In many places it did not leave even\r\na fifth-part of the people alive. It struck the whole world with\r\nterror. Such a plague has not been seen, or heard of, or recorded\r\nbefore this time, for it is thought so great a multitude of people\r\nwere not overwhelmed by the waters of the deluge, which happened in\r\nthe day of Noah. In this year many monks of Louth Park died; amongst\r\nthem was Dom Walter de Luda, the Abbot, on July 12th, who was much\r\npersecuted because of the manor of Cockrington, and he was buried\r\nbefore the high altar by the side of Sir Henry Vavasour, Knight.\r\nTo him Dom Richard de Lincoln succeeded the same day, canonically\r\nelected according to the institutes of Our Lord and the Order.\"[273]\r\n\r\nFrom a document relating to the Chapter of Lincoln it would appear\r\nthat the Courts of Law did not sit every term, during the universal\r\nvisitation. The dean and chapter complain that, whereas \"from time\r\nbeyond all memory\" they had received 6s. 8-1/2d. for some 66 acres\r\nof arable and four acres of meadow at Navenby, this year they had\r\nnot done so. Still they were called upon to pay the King's [p150]\r\ndues. They appealed; but there was no cause tried at Trinity anno 23º\r\n(1349) \"because of the absence of our judges assigned to hold the\r\ncommon pleas, by reason of the plague then raging.\"[274]\r\n\r\nThe audit of the Escheator's accounts for the county of Lincoln\r\nproves that the distress was very real. Saier de Rocheford, who held\r\nthe office for Rutland and Lincoln in 1351, sought to be relieved of\r\n£20 18s. 1d., which he was charged to pay for money he should have\r\nreceived, on the ground that he had got nothing, \"because of the\r\nmortality.\"[275] Three years later, moreover, he again pleads that he\r\nis unable to raise more, \"because of the deadly pestilence of men and\r\nof tenants of the land, who died in the year 1349, and on account of\r\nthe dearth of tenants\" since.\r\n\r\nThe people, he adds, were so impoverished that they could pay nothing\r\nfor \"Wapentakes.\"[276]\r\n\r\nArchbishop Zouche of York was apparently one of the first of the\r\nEnglish prelates to recognise the gravity of the epidemic, which in\r\n1348 was devastating Southern Europe, and ever creeping northwards\r\ntowards England. Before the end of July, 1348, he wrote to his\r\nofficial at York, ordering prayers. \"Since man's life on earth is\r\na warfare,\" he writes, \"those fighting amidst the miseries of this\r\nworld are troubled by the uncertainty of a future, now propitious,\r\nnow adverse. For the Lord Almighty sometimes permits those whom he\r\nloves to be chastised, since strength, by the infusion of spiritual\r\ngrace, is made perfect in infirmity. It is known to all what a\r\nmortal pestilence and infection of the atmosphere is hanging over\r\nvarious parts of the world, and especially England, in these days.\r\nThis, indeed, is caused by the sins of men who, made callous by\r\nprosperity, neglect to remember the benefits of the Supreme Giver.\"\r\nHe goes on to say that it is only by prayer that the scourge can be\r\nturned away, and he, therefore, orders that in all parish churches,\r\non every Wednesday and Friday, there [p151] shall be processions and\r\nlitanies, \"and in all masses there be said the special prayer for the\r\nstay of pestilence and infection of this kind.\"[277]\r\n\r\nJudging from a reply of the Pope to a petition of the Archbishop,\r\nit would be necessary to conclude that the plague had reached York\r\nas early as February, 1349. It is, however, more probable that the\r\npetition was sent in the expectation that the scourge would certainly\r\ncome sooner or later, and it was best to be prepared. From the dates\r\nof the institutions to vacant benefices, moreover, it would seem that\r\nthe province of York suffered chiefly in the summer and autumn of the\r\nyear 1349. Pope Clement VI., by letters to Archbishop Zouche, dated\r\nfrom Avignon as early as March 23rd, 1349, bestowed the faculties\r\nand indulgences already mentioned as having been granted to other\r\nBishops. This he did, as the letter says, \"in response to a petition\r\ndeclaring that the deadly pestilence has commenced to afflict the\r\ncity, diocese, and province of York.\"[278]\r\n\r\nThe county of York contained at this date some 470 benefices; or,\r\ncounting monastic houses and hospitals, some 550. It has been\r\npointed out that out of 141 livings in the West Riding, in which\r\nthe incumbent changed in 1349, ninety-six vacancies are registered\r\nas being caused by death, and in the East Riding 65 incumbents\r\ndied against 61 who apparently survived.[279] In the deanery of\r\nDoncaster,[280] out of fifty-six lists of incumbents, printed in\r\nthe [p152] local history, a change is recorded in thirty. It may\r\nbe concluded with certainty, from an examination of the printed\r\nlists of institutions for Yorkshire, that one-half at least of the\r\nclergy, generally, were carried off by the sickness. So serious did\r\nthe mortality among the cathedral officials become that steps were\r\ntaken to prevent the total cessation of business. In July, 1349, for\r\ninstance, \"it was ordained on account of the existing mortality of\r\nthe pestilence that one canon, with the auditor and chapter clerk,\r\nmight, in the absence of his fellows, grant vicarages and transact\r\nother matters of business as if the other canons were present,\r\nnotwithstanding the statutes.\"[281]\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop too sought and obtained from Pope Clement VI.\r\nfaculties to dispense with the usual ecclesiastical laws as to\r\nordinations taking place only in the Ember weeks. \"For fear the\r\nDivine worship may be diminished through want of ministers, or the\r\ncure and ruling of souls be neglected,\" writes the Pope, we grant\r\nleave to hold four extra ordinations during the year, since you say\r\n\"that on account of the mortal pestilence, which at present rages\r\nin your province,\" you fear that \"priests may not be sufficient for\r\nthe care and guidance of souls.\"[282] With this the Archbishop gives\r\na specimen of the testimonial letters to be granted to such as were\r\nordained under this faculty, reciting that it was given \"because of\r\nthe want of ecclesiastical ministers carried off by the pestilence\r\nlately existing in our Province.\"\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that the religious houses of the diocese\r\nsuffered in a similar way. The abbots of Jervaux and Rievaulx,\r\nWelbeck and Roche, the priors of Thurgarton, and Shelford, of\r\nMonkbretton, of Marton, of Haltemprice and Ferriby, are only some few\r\nof the superiors of religious houses who died at this time.\r\n\r\nFor one of the monasteries of the county, Meaux, there exists a\r\nspecial account in the chronicles of the house. [p153] Abbot Hugh,\r\nit says, \"besides himself had in the convent 42 monks and seven lay\r\nbrethren; and the said abbot Hugh, after having ruled the monastery\r\nnine years, eleven months and eleven days, died in the great plague\r\nwhich was in the year 1349, and 32 monks and lay brethren also died.\r\n\r\n\"This pestilence so prevailed in our said monastery, as in other\r\nplaces, that in the month of August the abbot himself, 22 monks and\r\nsix lay brethren died; of these, the abbot and five monks were lying\r\nunburied in one day, and the others died, so that when the plague\r\nceased, out of the said 50 monks and lay brethren, only ten monks\r\nwith no lay brethren were left.\r\n\r\n\"And from this the rents and possessions of the monastery began to\r\ndiminish, particularly as a greater part of our tenants in various\r\nplaces died, and the abbot, prior, cellarer, bursar, and other men of\r\nyears, and officials dying left those, who remained alive after them,\r\nunacquainted with the property, possessions, and common goods of the\r\nmonastery. The abbot died on 12th August, A.D. 1349.\"[283]\r\n\r\nIn the Deanery of Holderness, in which Meaux Abbey was situated,\r\nthere is evidence of great mortality. It is striking to observe how\r\nfrequently the bailiffs and collectors of royal rents and taxes are\r\nchanged. It is by no means uncommon to find an account rendered\r\nby the executors of executors to the original official.[284] This\r\nevidence as to the great extent of the mortality here as in other\r\nplaces of England, and as to the consequent distress, is borne out by\r\nthe _Inquisitiones post mortem_ for the period. In one case, where\r\nthe owner of the property had died on 28th July, 1349, it is said\r\nthat 114 acres of pasture were let at 12d. a year, \"and not more this\r\nyear because of the mortality and dearth of men.\" At Cliffe, on the\r\n[p154] same estate, the rents of customary tenants and tenants at\r\nwill are stated to have been usually worth £10 5s. a year; but in\r\nthis special year they had produced only two shillings.[285]\r\n\r\nThe chronicler of Meaux has described the disastrous consequences\r\nof the sickness in his own monastery. That this condition was not\r\nsoon mended appears certain from the fact that in 1354 it was found\r\nnecessary to hand over the abbey, \"on account of its miserable\r\ncondition,\" to a royal commission.[286]\r\n\r\nThe account of the King's Escheator in Yorkshire for the year, from\r\nOctober, 1349, to October, 1350, states that he could in no way\r\nobtain the sum of £4 12s. 2d., \"due on certain lands and tenements\r\nfrom which he had levied and could levy nothing during the said time\r\nbecause of the mortality amongst men in those parts, and owing to the\r\ndearth of tenants, willing to take up the said land and tenements.\"\r\nThen follows a list of houses standing vacant.[287]\r\n\r\nAs another instance may be quoted a case related in the history of\r\nthe deanery of Doncaster. \"John FitzWilliam, the heir of Sir William,\r\nhad a short enjoyment of the family estates. He died in the great\r\nplague of 1349. I transcribe, to show public feeling at the time,\r\nfrom a chronicle: 'And in these daies was burying withoute sorrowe\r\nand wedding without frendschippe and fleying without refute of\r\nsocoure; for many fled from place to place because of the pestilence;\r\nbut yet they were effecte and myghte not skape the dethe.'\r\n\r\n\"In another part of the deanery we find a person willing that his\r\ngoods shall be divided among such of his children as shall remain\r\nalive. In the FitzWilliams' MS. is a contemporary memorandum that\r\nJohn FitzWilliam, the father, gave in the time of the pestilence\r\nbefore his death all his [p155] goods and chattels, movable and\r\nimmovable, to dame Joan, his wife, John, his son, and Alleyn, late\r\nparson of Crosby, amounting to the sum of £288 3s. 8-1/2d.\"[288]\r\n\r\nAn incident recorded by the same writer will serve to show how\r\nuncertain people, at this time, regarded the tenure of life, a\r\nfeeling hardly to be wondered at when so many were dying all round\r\nthem. Thomas Allott, of Wombwell, in the deanery of Doncaster, in his\r\nwill, proved 14th September, 1349, after desiring to be buried at\r\nDarfield, says: \"Item I leave, etc., to my sons and daughters living\r\nafter this present mortal pestilence.\"[289]\r\n\r\nThese notes upon the evidence for the plague in Yorkshire may be\r\nconcluded by a brief account of the state of Hull in consequence\r\nof the mortality and other causes. In 1353 the King, \"considering\r\nthe waste and destruction which our town of Kingston-on-Hull has\r\nsuffered, both through the overflow of the waters of the Humber\r\nand other causes, and that a great part of the people of the said\r\ntown have died in the last deadly pestilence which raged in these\r\nparts, and that the remnant left in the town are so desolate and\r\npoverty-stricken in money,\" grants them permission to apply the fines\r\nordered to be imposed on labourers and servants demanding higher\r\nwages than before, to the payment of the fifteenth they owe the royal\r\nexchequer.[290]\r\n\r\nWestward of Yorkshire the extensive but then sparsely populated\r\ncounty of Lancashire stretches between it and the Irish sea. Of this\r\ncounty there is practically little to be recorded. The number of\r\nbenefices which existed in the county was about 65, whilst the number\r\nof chaplains and non-beneficed clergy generally must have greatly\r\nexceeded that number. In the deanery of Blackburn alone there were at\r\nthe close of the reign of Edward III at [p156] least 55 capellani\r\nwithout benefices.[291] One document, of its kind unique, relating\r\nto Lancashire and to this great plague, is preserved in the Record\r\nOffice. It was long ago referred to by the late Professor Thorold\r\nRogers, and is now printed in the _English Historical Review_. It is\r\na statement of the supposed number of deaths during the incidence of\r\nthe great pestilence in the deanery of Amounderness. Unfortunately,\r\nas perhaps might be expected in such a mortality, when death came\r\nso suddenly and men followed one another so rapidly to the grave\r\nthat vast numbers had to be cast as quickly as possible into the\r\nsame plague pit, the figures are clearly only approximate, being in\r\nevery instance round numbers. Still, as they were adduced at a legal\r\ninvestigation and before a jury, when the facts of the visitation\r\nof Providence must have been fresh in the minds of those who heard\r\nthe evidence, it is difficult to suppose that they are mere gross\r\nexaggerations, and may at least be taken as proof that the mortality\r\nin this district of Lancashire was very considerable.\r\n\r\nThe paper in question is the record of a claim for the profits\r\nreceived, or supposed to have been received, by the dean of\r\nAmounderness, acting as procurator for the Archdeacon of Richmond,\r\nfor proof of wills, administration of intestate estates, and other\r\nmatters, during the course of the plague of 1349. Ten parishes are\r\nnamed in the claim, including Preston, Lancaster, and Garstang.\r\nIn those ten parishes it supposes that some 13,180 souls had died\r\nbetween September 8th, 1349, and January 11th, 1350. In both Preston\r\nand Lancaster 3,000 are said to have been carried off, and in\r\nGarstang 2,000. Nine benefices are declared to have been vacant,\r\nthree of them twice, whilst the chapel of St. Mary Magdalene, at\r\nPreston, is stated to have been unserved for seven weeks. The Priory\r\nof Lytham is also noted as having been rendered vacant by the\r\nsickness, [p157] whilst 80 people of the village were said to have\r\ndied at the same time.[292]\r\n\r\nFrom the Patent rolls it would appear that Cartmel Priory, also,\r\nabout this time lost its superior, as upon September 20th, 1349,\r\nthe King's licence was granted to the community to proceed to a new\r\nelection.[293]\r\n\r\nThe counties of Westmoreland, to the north of Lancashire, with\r\nCumberland, still further to the north again, carry the western part\r\nof England to the borders of Scotland. In the former there were\r\nsome 57 beneficed clergy, and in the latter about 85. From these\r\nfigures the approximate number of beneficed priests who died in the\r\npestilence in the two counties may be guessed at about 72.\r\n\r\nThe state of this borderland county of Cumberland was, even before\r\nthe arrival of the plague in the district, deplorable. The Memoranda\r\nrolls of the period contain ample evidence that the Scottish\r\ninvasions had rendered the land desolate and almost uninhabitable.\r\nStill the mortality added to the misery of the people. The few\r\n_Inquisitiones post mortem_ afford little knowledge, beyond the fact\r\nthat here also the dearth of tenants was severely felt.[294] The\r\naudit of the accounts of Richard de Denton, late Vice-Sheriff of the\r\nCounty, is more precise in its information. He declares, in excuse\r\nfor the smallness of his returns, that \"the great part of the manor\r\nlands, attached to the King's Castle at Carlisle,\" has remained until\r\nthe year of his account, 1354, waste and uncultivated, \"by reason of\r\nthe mortal pestilence lately raging in those parts.\" Moreover, for\r\none and a half years after the plague had passed the entire lands\r\nremained \"uncultivated for lack of labourers and divers tenants.\r\nMills, fishing, pastures, and meadow lands could not be let during\r\nthat time for want of tenants willing to take the farms of those who\r\ndied in the said plague.\" [p158]\r\n\r\nRichard de Denton then produced a schedule of particulars, which\r\nmay now be seen stitched on to the roll. This gives the items of\r\ndecrease in rents; for instance, there are houses, cottages, and\r\nlands to let, which used to bring in £5, and now but £1; \"the farm of\r\na garden belonging to the King, called King's Mead, is rented now at\r\n13 shillings and fourpence less than it used to be,\" and so on. The\r\njury, who were called to consider these statements, concluded that\r\nRichard de Denton had proved them, and they enter a verdict to that\r\neffect, giving a list of the tenants, and adding \"the said Richard\r\nsays that all the last-mentioned tenants died in the said plague,\r\nand all the tenements have stood since empty through a dearth of\r\ntenants.\"[295]\r\n\r\nAn indication of the same difficulties which beset the people of\r\nCumberland at this time is found in the case of the prior of Hagham,\r\nan alien house, to farm which, during the time it was in the King's\r\nhands on account of his French war, the prior had been appointed, on\r\ncondition of his paying the sum of threepence a day in rent to be\r\npaid to the Bishop of Carlisle. At this time he could not get even\r\nthis out of the land, and could not live, by reason of the great\r\ndearness of provisions.[296]\r\n\r\nThe city of Carlisle also in 1352 was relieved of taxation to a\r\ngreat extent, because \"it is rendered void, and more than usual is\r\ndepressed, by the mortal pestilence lately raging in those parts.\"\r\n\r\nThe two remaining counties of England, Durham and Northumberland,\r\nwere no exceptions to the general mortality. In the former there were\r\nsome 93 beneficed clergy and in the latter about 72, figures from\r\nwhich, on the usual calculation, may be deduced the numbers of the\r\nbeneficed clergy who died at this time.\r\n\r\nIn the Durham Cursitor records of this time a glimpse is [p159]\r\nafforded of the state of these northern counties. The Halmote courts\r\nwere similar to the manor courts, and were held by commissioners\r\nappointed under the great seal of the Palatinate of Durham, by the\r\nBishop's certificate, to receive surrender of copyhold lands, to\r\nsettle fines, contentions, and generally to transact the business of\r\nthe estates. At one of these Halmote courts, held at Houghton on the\r\n14th of July, 1349, it is recorded: \"that there is no one who will\r\npay the fine for any land, which is in the lord's hands through fear\r\nof the plague. And so all are in the same way of being proclaimed as\r\ndefaulters until God shall bring some remedy.\" At another court \"all\r\nrefused their fines on account of the pestilence.\" In another, after\r\nstating the receipts, the record adds: \"And not more on account of\r\nthe poverty and pestilence;\" and one tenant \"was unwilling to take\r\nthe land in any other way, since even if he survived the plague, he\r\nabsolutely refused to pay a fine.\" There are many similar instances\r\nin the records at this period, and in one case it is noted that \"a\r\nman and his whole family had fled before the dreaded disease.\"[297]\r\n\r\nIn Northumberland the case of the people was so desperate that in\r\n1353 more than £600, which was owing to the King for taxes for five\r\nand twenty parishes named, was allowed to stand over for some months\r\nsince it was hopeless to press for payment.[298]\r\n\r\nOf Newcastle the same story is told. \"It has been shown us,\" writes\r\nthe King, \"in a serious complaint by the men of Newcastle-on-Tyne,\r\nthat, since very many merchants and other rich people who were wont\r\nto pay the greater part of the tenth, fifteenth, and other burdens\r\nof the town, have died in the deadly pestilence lately raging in the\r\ntown, and since the population remaining alive, who were wont to live\r\nby their trading, are by the said pestilence and other adverse causes\r\nin this time of war, [p160] so impoverished that they hardly possess\r\nsufficient to live upon,\"[299] they cannot now pay what is due.\r\n\r\nAt Alnwick, still further north, the plague may be traced into the\r\nspring of the following year, 1350; at least, the chronicle of the\r\nabbey there states that \"in the year 1350 (which for them began March\r\n25th) John, abbot of Alnwick, died in the common mortality.\"[300]\r\nLastly, it is related by two contemporary authors that the Scotch\r\ncarried the disease over the borders into their own country. \"The\r\nScots,\" writes Knighton, \"hearing of the cruel pestilence among the\r\nEnglish, thought this had happened to them as a judgment at the\r\nhand of God. They laughed at their enemies, and took as an oath the\r\nexpression, 'Be the foul deth of Engelond,' and so thinking that the\r\nterrible judgment of God had overwhelmed the English, they assembled\r\nin the forest of Selkirk with the intention of invading England. The\r\nterrible mortality, however, came upon them, and the Scotch were\r\nscattered by the sudden and cruel death, and there died in a short\r\ntime about five thousand.\"[301]\r\n\r\nAn account of the visitation given in the continuation of a\r\nchronicle, probably written at the time, and possibly by a monk\r\nat Tynemouth, may fitly conclude this review of the course of the\r\nepidemic in England; telling, though it does, ever the same story,\r\nand reading like an echo of the plaint first raised in Europe on the\r\nshores of the Bosphorus and in the islands of the Mediterranean. \"In\r\nthe year of our Lord 1348, and in the month of August,\" writes this\r\nchronicler, \"there began the deadly pestilence in England which three\r\nyears previously had commenced in India, and then had spread through\r\nall Asia and Africa, and coming into Europe had depopulated Greece,\r\nItaly, Provence, [p161] Burgundy, Spain, Aquitaine, Ireland, France,\r\nwith its subject provinces, and at length England and Wales, so far,\r\nat least, as to the general mass of citizens and rustic folk and\r\npoor, but not princes and nobles.\r\n\r\n\"So much so that very many country towns and quarters of innumerable\r\ncities are left altogether without inhabitants. The churches or\r\ncemeteries before consecrated did not suffice for the dead; but new\r\nplaces outside the cities and towns were at that time dedicated\r\nto that use by people and bishops. And the said mortality was so\r\ninfectious in England that hardly one remained alive in any house it\r\nentered. Hence flight was regarded as the hope of safety by most,\r\nalthough such fugitives, for the most part, did not escape death in\r\nthe mortality, although they obtained some delay in the sentence.\r\nRectors and priests, and friars also, confessing the sick, by the\r\nhearing of the confessions, were so infected by that contagious\r\ndisease that they died more quickly even than their penitents; and\r\nparents in many places refused intercourse with their children, and\r\nhusband with wife.\"[302]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[229] _The Coming of the Friars_, pp. 166-261.\r\n\r\n[230] The following is a table of the Institutions during four\r\nmonths:—\r\n\r\n +---------------------------+\r\n |           1349.           |\r\n +------+------+------+------+\r\n |April.| May. | June.| July.|\r\n +------+------+------+------+\r\n | 23   |  74  | 139  | 209  |\r\n +------+------+------+------+\r\n\r\n[231] _Ibid._, p. 200.\r\n\r\n[232] _Ibid._, p. 203.\r\n\r\n[233] Blomefield, _History of Norfolk_ (folio ed.), ii, p. 681.\r\n\r\n[234] F.

It is now necessary to consider some statistics and\r\nimmediate results of the plague.\r\n\r\nThe diocese of Salisbury comprised the three counties of Dorset,\r\nWilts, and Berkshire. The total number of appointments made by the\r\nBishop, in his entire diocese, is said to have been 202 in the period\r\nfrom March 25th, 1348, to March 25th, 1349; and 243 during the same\r\ntime in the year following.[303] Of this total number of 445 it is\r\nsafe to say that two-thirds were institutions to vacancies due to\r\nthe plague. Roughly speaking, therefore, in these three counties,\r\ncomprised in the diocese of Sarum, some 300 beneficed clergy, at\r\nleast, fell victims to the scourge.\r\n\r\nThe county of Dorset may first be taken. The list of institutions\r\ntaken from the Salisbury episcopal registers, given in Hutchins'\r\nhistory of that county, numbers 211. During the incidence of the\r\nplague ninety of these record a change of incumbent, so that,\r\nroughly, about half the benefices were rendered vacant. In several\r\ncases, moreover, during the progress of the epidemic changes\r\nare recorded twice or three times, so that the total number of\r\ninstitutions made to Dorsetshire livings at this time was 110.\r\nAs regards the non-beneficed clergy, secular and regular, their\r\nproportion to those holding benefices will be considered in the\r\n[p163] concluding chapter. Here it is sufficient to observe that the\r\nproportion commonly suggested is far too low.\r\n\r\nIt is almost by chance that any information is afforded as to the\r\neffect of the visitation in the religious houses. All contemporary\r\nauthorities, both abroad and in England, agree in stating that the\r\ndisease was always most virulent and spread most rapidly where\r\nnumbers were gathered together, and that, when once it seized upon\r\nany house, it usually claimed many victims. Consequently when it\r\nappears that early in November, 1348, the abbot of Abbotsbury died,\r\nand that about Christmas Day of that year John de Henton, the abbot\r\nof the great monastery of Sherborne, also died, it is more than\r\nprobable that many of the brethren of those monasteries were also\r\ncarried off by the scourge.\r\n\r\nIn the county of Wilts the average number of episcopal institutions,\r\nfor three years before and three years after the mortality, was\r\nonly 26. In the year 1348 there are 73 institutions recorded in the\r\nregisters, and in 1349 no less a number than 103,[304] so that of\r\nthe 176 vacancies filled in the two years the deaths of only some 52\r\nincumbents were probably due to normal causes, and the rest, or some\r\n125 priests holding benefices in the county, may be said to have died\r\nfrom the plague.\r\n\r\nA chance entry upon the Patent roll reveals the state of one\r\nmonastery in this county. The prior of Ederos, or Ivychurch, a house\r\nof Augustinian canons, died on February 2nd, 1349.[305] On February\r\nthe 25th the King was informed that death had carried off the entire\r\ncommunity with one single exception. \"Know ye,\" runs the King's\r\nletter, dated March 16th, \"that since the Venerable Father Robert,\r\nBishop of Salisbury, cannot hold the usual election of prior in the\r\nMonastery of Ederos in his diocese, vacant by the death of the last\r\nprior of the same, since all the other canons of the same house,\r\nin which hitherto there [p164] has been a community of thirteen\r\ncanons regular, have died, except only one canon, brother James de\r\nGrundwell, we appoint him custodian of the possessions, the Bishop\r\ntestifying that he is a fit and proper person for the office.[306]\r\n\r\nThe general state of the county of Wilts after the epidemic had\r\npassed is well illustrated from some Wiltshire _Inquisitiones post\r\nmortem_. Sir Henry Husee, for instance, had died on the 21st of\r\nJune, 1349. He owned a small property in the county. Some 300 acres\r\nof pasture were returned upon oath, by a jury of the neighbourhood,\r\nas \"of no value because all the tenants are dead.\"[307] Again John\r\nLestraunge, of Whitchurch, a Shropshire gentleman, had half the manor\r\nof Broughton, in the county of Wilts. He died on July the 20th,\r\n1349, and the inquisition was held on August the 30th. At that time\r\nit is declared that only seven shillings had been received as rent\r\nfrom a single tenant, \"and not more this year, because all the other\r\ntenants, as well as the natives, are dead, and their land is all in\r\nthe hand of the lord.\"[308]\r\n\r\nSo, too, on the manor of Caleston, belonging to Henry de Wilington,\r\nwho died on May the 23rd, 1349, it is said that water-mills are\r\ndestroyed and worthless; of the six native tenants two have died,\r\nand their lands are in hand; and of the ten cottars, each of whom\r\npaid 12d. for his holding, four have been carried off with all their\r\nfamily.[309] In other places of the same county woods are declared\r\nto be valueless, \"for want of buyers, on account of the pestilence\r\namongst the population;\"[310] from tenants who used to pay £4 a year\r\nthere is now obtained only 6s., because all but three free tenants\r\nhave been swept away;[311] 140 acres of land and twelve cottages,\r\nformerly in the occupation of [p165] natives of a manor, are all\r\nnow in hand, \"as all are dead.\"[312] So, too, at East Grinstead,\r\nseven miles from Salisbury, on the death of Mary, wife of Stephen de\r\nTumby, in the August of 1349, it is found that only three tenants are\r\nleft on the estate, \"and not more because John Wadebrok and Walter\r\nWadebrok, Stephen and Thomas and John Kerde, Richard le Frer, Ralph\r\nBodde, and Thomas the Tanner, tenants in bondage,\" who held certain\r\ntenements and lands, are all dead, and their holdings are left in the\r\nhands of the lord of the manor. Also, on the same estate, William le\r\nHanaker, John Pompe, Edmund Saleman, John Whermeter, and John Gerde,\r\njun., have also been swept away by the all-prevailing pestilence.\r\n\r\nSuch examples as these will enable the reader to understand the\r\nterrible mortality produced by this visitation, and in some measure\r\nto appreciate the social difficulties and changes produced by the\r\nsudden removal of so large a number of the population from every part\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nTo pass on to the neighbouring county of Somerset. The institutions\r\ngiven in the episcopal registers of the diocese of Bath and Wells\r\nshow that the mortality had already commenced in the county as early\r\nas November, 1348. The average number of inductions to livings in\r\nthe county in each month of 1348, previous to November, was less\r\nthan three; in November it was nine, and in the following month\r\nthirty-two. During the next year, 1349, the total number of clergy\r\ninstituted to the vacant livings of the diocese by the Bishop was\r\n232, against an average in a normal year of 35. For the two years,\r\n1348 and 1349, consequently, out of the 297 benefices to which\r\ninstitutions were made, some 227 may be said, with fair certainty, to\r\nhave been rendered vacant by the great mortality which then raged in\r\nthis and other counties of England.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that the death of every priest implied\r\nthe deaths of very many of his flock, so [p166] that, if no other\r\ninformation were attainable, some idea of the extent of the sickness\r\namong the laity may be obtained. It cannot but be believed that\r\nthe people generally suffered as greatly as the clergy, and that,\r\nproportionally, as many of them fell victims to the scourge. If the\r\nproportion of priests to lay folk was then (as some writers have\r\nsuggested) about one to fifty—an estimate, however, which would seem\r\nto be considerably above the actual relation of laymen to those in\r\nsacred orders at that time—the reader can easily form some notion of\r\nthe terrible mortality among the people of Somersetshire in the first\r\nhalf of 1349.\r\n\r\nSome slight information, however, is afforded as to the actual state\r\nof the county in one or two instances. In each manor throughout the\r\ncountry there was held periodically what was known as the Court\r\nof the manor. At this assembly the business of the estate, so far\r\nas the tenants were concerned, was transacted before a chosen and\r\nsworn jury. Holders of land under the lord of the manor came before\r\nthe court to claim their tenements and land as the rightful heirs\r\nof tenants deceased, to pay their heriots or fines due to the lord\r\non every entry of a new holder. At this assembly, too, matters\r\nof police, the infringement of local customs, and often disputes\r\nbetween the tenants themselves, were disposed of by the officials\r\nof the manor. The record of the business of such courts is known as\r\nthe Court roll, and these documents give some information about the\r\nextent of the mortality among the manorial tenants. Here, however,\r\njust as in the case of the institutions of clergy, where the actual\r\nincumbent only is registered and no account is taken of the larger\r\nbody of non-beneficed clergy, so on the Court roll only the actual\r\nholder of the land is entered, and no notice is taken of the members\r\nof his family, or of others in the district, such as labourers and\r\nservants, etc., who were not actual tenants of the manor.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the Court rolls for this period are often, if not\r\ngenerally, found to be missing. They are either lost, or the\r\ndisorganised state of the country consequent upon the [p167] great\r\nmortality did not permit of the court being held. There are, however,\r\nquite sufficient of these records to afford a tolerably good idea\r\nof what must have happened pretty generally throughout the country.\r\nDr. Jessopp has been able by the use of the Norfolk Court rolls to\r\npresent his readers with a vivid picture of the havoc made by the\r\nplague in East Anglia. As an illustration of the same, some notes\r\nfrom a few Court rolls of West of England manors may here be given.\r\n\r\nThe records of the royal manor of Gillingham, in the county of\r\nDorset, show that at a court, held on \"Wednesday next after the feast\r\nof St. Lucy (13 December), 1348,\" heriots were paid on the deaths of\r\nsome twenty-eight tenants, and the total receipts on this account,\r\nwhich at ordinary courts amounted to but a few shillings, were £28\r\n15s. 8d. Further, at the same sittings, the bailiff notes that he\r\nhas in hand the lands and tenements of about thirty tenants, who had\r\napparently left no heir to succeed to their holdings. In numbers of\r\ncases it is declared that no heriot has been paid, and this although\r\nthe receipts on this score at the sitting of the court, and on many\r\nsubsequent sittings, are unusually large. At another court, held\r\nearly in the following year (1349) the names of two-and-twenty\r\ntenants of the manor are recorded as having died, and two large slips\r\nof parchment, belonging to the court held on May 6th, give the lists\r\nof dead tenants. Thus in the tything of Gillingham alone forty-five\r\ndeaths are recorded, and in the neighbouring tything of Bourton\r\nseventeen.[313]\r\n\r\nThe next example may be taken from the rolls of a Wiltshire manor,\r\nand ought, perhaps, to have been given in the account of the plague\r\nin that county. On June the 11th, 1349, a court was held at Stockton,\r\nsome seven miles from Warminster, consequently only a short distance\r\nfrom [p168] the boundaries of Somerset. The manor, be it remarked,\r\nwas evidently only a very small one. On the parchment record it is\r\nstated that since the previous Martinmas (November 11th, 1348) no\r\ncourt had been held, and from the entries upon the roll it appears\r\nthat out of a small body of tenants on this estate fourteen had died.\r\nHow many had been carried off in each household does not, of course,\r\nappear, but in the majority of instances it looks very much as if the\r\ndead tenant had left no heir behind him.[314]\r\n\r\nA third instance is taken from the Court roll of the manor of\r\nChedzoy, near Bridgwater. The plague had made its appearance at\r\nBridgwater, as before related, some time previous to November 21,\r\n1348. It was to be expected, therefore, that the rolls of a manor\r\nonly three miles off would show some sign of the mortality among\r\nthe tenants about the same period. As a matter of fact a glance\r\nthrough the parchment record of a court held on St. Katherine's day,\r\nNovember 25, 1348, shows that it had made its appearance some time\r\nbetween September 29th and November 25th. On this latter day some\r\nfew of the tenants of the manor are noted as dead, and three or four\r\nfairly large holdings have also fallen into the hands of the lord of\r\nthe manor, no heirs being forthcoming. Amongst others, one William\r\nHammond, who had rented and worked a water-mill, at a place called\r\n_le Slap_, had been carried off by the sickness. The house, it is\r\nnoted, had since, up to the date of the court, stood vacant. The mill\r\nwheel no longer spun round at its work, for William Hammond, the\r\nmiller, had left no one to succeed him in his occupation.\r\n\r\nBut this was only a beginning. The next court was held on Thursday\r\nafter the Epiphany, January 8th, 1349. What a terrible Christmas\r\ntime it must have been for those Somerset villagers on the low-lying\r\nground about Bridgwater, flooded and sodden by the long months of\r\nincessant rain! At least twenty more tenants are marked off upon\r\n[p169] the roll as dead, and as in this case the actual days of\r\ntheir deaths are given, it is clear the plague claimed many victims\r\nin this neighbourhood about the close of December, 1348.\r\n\r\nBetween this and March 23, 1349, the sickness was at its worst in\r\nthis manor of Chedzoy. The record of the proceedings at the court,\r\nheld on \"Monday after the feast of St. Benedict,\" 1349, occupies two\r\nlong skins of parchment closely written on both sides. Some 50 or\r\n60 fines are paid by new tenants on their taking possession of the\r\nlands and houses, which had belonged to others now dead and gone.\r\nAgain, who can tell how many had perished in each house? One thing is\r\nabsolutely clear. In this single Somerset village many homes had been\r\nleft vacant without a solitary inhabitant; many were taken over by\r\nnew tenants not connected with the old occupier; and in more than one\r\ninstance people came forward to act as guardians to young children\r\nwho had apparently been left alone in the world by the death of every\r\nnear relative. Take an instance. At this court one John Cran, who, by\r\nthe way, took up the house and lands formerly held by his father, who\r\nis said to have died, also agreed with the officer of the court to\r\ntake charge of William, the son of Nicholas atte Slope, for the said\r\nNicholas, and apparently every other near relative of the boy William\r\nhad perished in the sickness.\r\n\r\nIn this same court of March 23rd also several law cases are disposed\r\nof, for they had been settled by the death of one or other or both of\r\nthe parties. Thus, in January, 1349, a claim had been laid, at the\r\nsitting of the court, against one John Lager, for the return of some\r\ncattle by three tenants, William, John, and Roger Richeman. At the\r\nMarch sitting of the court in due course the case was called on. No\r\nplaintiffs, however, appeared, and inquiry elicited the fact that all\r\nthree had died in the great pestilence.\r\n\r\nThe actual document which contains these particulars has, moreover, a\r\ntale of its own to tell. The long entries [p170] on these two skins\r\nof parchment are not all in the same hand. Before the record of the\r\nheavy business done at this court had been all transcribed, the clerk\r\nwas changed. The hand which had so long kept the rolls of these Manor\r\nCourts ceases to write. What happened to him? Did he too die? Of\r\ncourse nothing can be known for certain, but it is not difficult to\r\nconjecture why another at this very time takes up the writing of the\r\nChedzoy manor records.[315]\r\n\r\nAnother glimpse of the desolate state to which the country was\r\ngenerally reduced by this disastrous sickness is afforded by the\r\ncase of Hinton and Witham, the two Somerset Carthusian houses. The\r\nKing had endeavoured by every means in his power to restrain the\r\ntenants, who survived the plague, from leaving their old holdings\r\nand seeking for others where they could better themselves. Not only\r\nwere fines ordered to be inflicted upon such labourers and tenants,\r\nas endeavoured to take advantage of the market rise in wages, but\r\nunder similar penalties landowners were prohibited from giving\r\nemployment to them. That such a law must have proved hard in the\r\ncase of those owning manors, in which some or all of the tenants and\r\nlabourers had died, is obvious. It was this hardship which some years\r\nafter the epidemic, in 1354, made the Carthusians of Witham plead\r\nfor some mitigation of the royal decree. \"Our beloved in Christ,\r\nthe prior and brethren of the Carthusian Order at Witham, in the\r\ncounty of Somerset,\" runs the King's reply, \"have petitioned us that\r\nsince their said house and all their lands and tenements thereto\r\nbelonging are within a close in the forest of Selwood, placed far\r\nfrom every town, and they possess no domain beyond the said close,\r\nthey have nothing to support the prior and his brethren,\" (and\r\nthis) \"both because almost all their servants and retainers died\r\nin the last pestilence, and [p171] because by reason of a command\r\nlately made by us and our Parliament, in which _inter alia_ it is\r\nordered that servants should not leave their villages and parishes\r\nin which they dwelt, as long as they could be hired there, they have\r\nbeen brought to great need on account of the want of servants and\r\nlabourers. Further, that a large part of their lands (for this same\r\nreason) remain waste and untilled, and the corn in the rest of their\r\nestate, which had been sown at the time of harvest, had miserably\r\nrotted as it could not be gathered for lack of reapers. By this they\r\nhave been brought into great and manifest poverty.\" Looking at the\r\ncircumstances, therefore, the King permits them for the future to\r\nengage servants and workmen on reasonable wages above the legal sum,\r\nprovided that their time of service elsewhere had expired.[316]\r\n\r\nThe second instance is recorded in the following year, 1355, and\r\nhas reference to difficulties springing from the same regulations\r\nas to the employment of labourers:—\"The prior and brethren of the\r\nCarthusians of Hinton, in the county of Somerset, have petitioned\r\nus,\" says the King, \"that seeing that they have no support except\r\nby the tillage of their lands, and that the greatest part of their\r\nestates, for want of workmen and servants from the time of the last\r\npestilence, have been unused and still remain uncultivated, and that\r\nthey cannot get any labourers to work their lands,\" (and further)\r\n\"that as many people and tenants were wont to weave the woollen cloth\r\nfor the clothes of the brethren from their wool, and do other various\r\nservices for them, now through fear of our orders as to servants that\r\nthey may not receive greater salaries and stipends from the said\r\nbrethren, do not dare to serve them as before, and so leave their\r\ndwelling, so that the brethren cannot get cloth to clothe themselves\r\nproperly,\" they beg that these orders may be relaxed in their regard.\r\nTo which petition the King assented, allowing the [p172] Carthusians\r\nof Hinton to pay the wages they had been used to do.[317]\r\n\r\nThe diocese of Exeter, comprising the two counties of Devon and\r\nCornwall, was stricken by the disease apparently about the same time\r\nas the county of Somerset. The institutions made by the Bishop of the\r\ndiocese, in January, 1349, number some 30, which shows that death had\r\nalready been busy among the clergy. The average number of livings\r\nannually rendered vacant in the two counties during the eight years\r\nprevious to 1348 was only 36. In the year 1349 the vacancies were\r\n382, and the number of appointments to vacant livings, in each of the\r\nfive months from March to July, was actually larger than the previous\r\nyearly average. It would appear, therefore, that in 1349 some 346\r\nvacancies may reasonably be ascribed to the prevailing sickness.\r\n\r\nIn looking over the lists of institutions it is evident that the\r\neffect of sickness was felt for some years. It is not until 1353 that\r\nthe normal average is again reached. The year following the epidemic\r\nthe number of vacancies filled up was 80, and even in 1351 it still\r\nremained at the high figure of 57. It is curious to note in these\r\nyears that numerous benefices lapsed to the Bishop. These must have\r\nbeen vacant six months, at least, before the dates when they were\r\nfilled by Bishop Grandisson. Sometimes, no doubt, patrons were dead,\r\nleaving no heirs behind them. Sometimes, in all probability, the\r\npatron could find no one to fill the cure. Further, the number of\r\nresignations of benefices during this period would appear to point to\r\nthe fact that many livings were now found to be too miserably poor to\r\nafford a bare maintenance.\r\n\r\nAfter the sickness was over here, as in other parts of England,\r\nthe desolation and distress is evidenced by chance references in\r\nthe inquisitions. Thus at Lydford, a manor on Dartmoor, the King's\r\nescheator returns the value of a [p173] mill at fifteen shillings,\r\nin place of the previous value of double that amount, because \"most\r\nof the tenants, who used to grind their corn at it, have died in the\r\nplague.\" It is the same at other places in the county, and in one\r\ncase 30 holdings are named as having fallen into the hands of the\r\nlord of the manor.[318]\r\n\r\nA bundle of accounts for the Duchy of Lancaster gives a good idea of\r\nthe effect of the pestilence in Cornwall. The roll is for the year\r\nfrom Michaelmas, 1350, and includes the accounts of several manors\r\nin the Deanery of Trigg, such as Helston, Tintagel, and others, in\r\nthe district about the river Camel. In one it is noted that \"this\r\nyear there are no buyers;\" in another only two youths pay poll\r\ntax, two more have not paid, as they have been put in charge of\r\nsome land, \"and the rest have died in the pestilence.\" In the same\r\nplace pasture, which usually let for 3s. 4d., now, \"because of the\r\npestilence,\" fetched only 20d.; the holdings of five tenants are\r\nnamed as in hand, as well as nine other tenements and 214 acres of\r\nland. Again, in another place the rent has diminished by £7 14s.,\r\nbecause 14 holdings and 102 acres are in hand, together with two\r\nfulling mills; on the other hand credit is given for 8s. 11d., the\r\nvalue of the goods and chattels of the natives of the manor who have\r\ndied. And so the roll proceeds through the accounts of some twelve or\r\nfourteen manors, and everywhere the same story of desolation appears.\r\nBesides numerous holdings and hundreds of acres, represented as in\r\nhand and producing nothing, entire hamlets are named as having been\r\ndepopulated. The decay in rent of one manor alone is set down at £30\r\n6s. 1-3/4d.\r\n\r\nAttached to the account of Helston, in Trigg, is a skin giving a list\r\nof goods and effects of different tenants named which the lord Prince\r\n\"occupied.\" There are 57 items in this list, which includes goods of\r\nall sorts, from an article of female dress and a golden buckle to\r\nploughs and [p174] copper dishes; and the total value of the goods\r\nwhich thus fell into the hands of the Black Prince, presumably by the\r\ndeath of his tenants without heirs, is £16 18s. 8d.\r\n\r\nAt Tintagel it is noted that the \"fifty shillings previously paid\r\neach year as stipend to the chaplain who celebrated in the chapel,\r\nwas not paid this year, because no one would stay to minister there\r\nfor the said stipend.\"[319]\r\n\r\nOn the 29th May, 1350, the Black Prince, in view of the great\r\ndistress throughout the district, authorised his officials to remit\r\none-fourth part of the rents of the tenants who were left, \"for fear\r\nthey should through poverty depart from their holdings.\"[320] But\r\nJohn Tremayn, the receiver of the revenues of the Prince in Cornwall,\r\nstates that even in the years 1352 and 1353, so far from the estates\r\nthere showing any recovery, they were in a more deplorable state\r\nstill. \"For the said two years,\" he relates, \"he has not been able to\r\nlet (the lands), nor to raise or obtain anything from the said lands\r\nand tenements, because the said tenements for the most part have\r\nremained unoccupied, and the lands lain waste for want of tenants (in\r\nthe place of those) who died in the mortal pestilence lately raging\r\nin the said county.\"[321]\r\n\r\nThe loss of the episcopal registers of London for this period\r\nmakes it impossible to form any certain estimate of the deaths in\r\nthe ranks of the clergy of the capital during the progress of the\r\nepidemic. London contained within its walls, at that time, some 140\r\nparish churches, exclusive of the large number of religious houses\r\ngrouped together in its precincts. It is not unreasonable to suppose\r\nthat the mortality here was greater than elsewhere. The population\r\nwas closely packed in narrow streets, the religious houses were\r\nexceptionally numerous, and many of them, from their very situation,\r\ncould have had but very little space. It has already been seen\r\nhow fatal was the entry [p175] of the plague into any house, and\r\nconsequently the proportion of deaths among the regulars in London\r\nwas doubtless greater than elsewhere, whilst other causes must have\r\nalso contributed to raise the roll of death among the seculars.[322]\r\n\r\nThe diocese of London included, with Middlesex, the county of Essex\r\nand a portion of Hertfordshire. The benefices of the county of Essex\r\nwere in number some 265, and, like the actual institutions of the\r\nMiddlesex clergy for this period, those made in the county of Essex\r\nare unknown. By July, 1349, the consequences of the scourge clearly\r\nappear in the _Inquisitiones post mortem_ for this county. In one\r\nmanor ten acres of meadow, which had formerly been let for twenty\r\nshillings, this year produced only half that amount, \"because of the\r\ncommon pestilence.\" For the same reason the arable land had fallen\r\nin value, and a water-mill was idle, as there was no miller. In\r\nanother place 140 acres of arable land was lying waste. \"It cannot\r\nbe let at all,\" says the Inquisition, \"but if it could be let, it\r\nwould be worth but eleven shillings and sixpence\" only, in place of\r\ntwenty-three shillings. Here, too, pasture had fallen fifty per cent,\r\nin value, and the wood that had been cut could not be sold. So, too,\r\nat a manor near Maldon, in this county, prices had fallen to half the\r\nprevious value, and here the additional information is given that,\r\nout of eleven native tenants of the manor eight have died, and their\r\ntenements and land were in hand. It is the same in every instance;\r\nrents had dropped, owing to the catastrophe, to one-half. Arable,\r\nmeadow, and pasture could be obtained this year in Essex anywhere at\r\nsuch a reduction. Other estate receipts had fallen equally. In one\r\nplace court fees were three in place of the usual six shillings, and\r\nthe manor [p176] dove-house brought in one instead of two shillings.\r\nWater mills were at a greater discount even than this. One, at a\r\nplace called Longford, was valued at twenty shillings in place of\r\nsixty shillings, and even at this reduction there is considerable\r\ndoubt expressed whether it will let at all.\r\n\r\nLastly, to take one more example in the county of Essex. An inquiry\r\nwas made as to the lands held by the abbot of Colchester, who died\r\non August the 24th, 1349. In this it appears that, in the manors of\r\nEast and West Denny, 320 acres of arable land had fallen in yearly\r\nvalue from four to two pence an acre; 14 acres of meadow from 18d. to\r\n8d.; the woods are valueless, \"because there are no buyers;\" and out\r\nof six native tenants two are dead. In another place four out of six\r\nhave been carried off; in another, only two are left out of seven.\r\nThe rent of assize, it is declared, is only £4, \"and no more, because\r\nmost of the land is in hand.\"[323]\r\n\r\nNo account has been preserved of the ravages of the pestilence at the\r\nabbey of Colchester; but the death of the abbot at this time makes\r\nit not unlikely that the disease was as disastrous here as in other\r\nmonasteries of which there is preserved some record. It is known that\r\nthe town suffered considerably. \"One of the most striking effects\r\nwas,\" writes one author, \"that wills to the unusual number of 111\r\nwere enrolled at Colchester, which at that time had the privilege of\r\ntheir probate and enrolment.\"[324]\r\n\r\nTalkeley, an alien priory in Essex, was reduced to complete\r\ndestitution. It was a cell of St. Valery's Abbey, in Picardy, and\r\nwhen seized into the King's hands on account of the war with France\r\nthe prior was allowed to hold the lands on condition of his paying\r\n£126 a year into the royal purse. Two years after the plague had\r\nvisited the county this payment had fallen into arrears, \"by reason\r\nof the pestilence lately raging, from which time the said land\r\n[p177] remained uncultivated, and the holdings, from which the\r\nrevenues of the priory were derived, remained unoccupied after the\r\ndeath of the tenants. So terribly is it impoverished that it has\r\nnothing upon which to live, and on account of the arrears no one is\r\nwilling to rent the lands and tenements of the priory.\" In the end\r\nthe King was compelled to forgive the arrears of rent.[325]\r\n\r\nIn the county of Hertfordshire 34 benefices were in the diocese of\r\nLondon, whilst 22 more were under the jurisdiction of no Bishop,\r\nbut formed a peculiar of the abbey of St. Alban's. In both of these\r\nconsequently the actual institutions made in the year of the great\r\nplague are unknown. For the portion within the diocese of Lincoln 27\r\ninstitutions were made in the summer of 1349; so that probably at\r\nleast 50 Hertfordshire clergy died at this time.\r\n\r\nThe values of land and produce fell, as in other places. In one\r\ninstance, given in an _Inquisitio post mortem_ into the estate of\r\nThomas Fitz-Eustace, the lands and tenements, formerly valued at\r\n67 shillings, were on the 3rd of August this year, 1349, estimated\r\nto produce only 13 shillings, and this only \"if the pasture can be\r\nlet.\"[326] In the same way the Benedictine convent of Cheshunt, in\r\nthe county, is declared shortly afterwards \"to be oppressed with\r\nsuch poverty in these days that the community have not wherewith to\r\nlive.\"[327]\r\n\r\nAgain the destitution and poverty produced by the pestilence is\r\nevidenced in the case of some lands in the county, given by Sir\r\nThomas Chedworth to Anglesey priory in Cambridgeshire. It had been\r\nagreed, shortly before the scourge had fallen upon England, that the\r\nmonastery should for this benefaction endow a chantry of two secular\r\npriests. In 1351, however, the state of Anglesey priory, consequent\r\non the fall in rents, made this impossible, and the obligation\r\nwas, through the Bishop, readjusted, and the [p178] new document\r\nrecites:—\"Carefully considering the great and ruinous miseries which\r\nhave occurred on account of the vast mortality of men in these days,\r\nto wit, that lands lie uncultivated in innumerable places, not a few\r\ntenements daily decay and are pulled down, rents and services cannot\r\nbe levied, nor the advantage thereof, generally had, can be received,\r\nbut a much smaller profit is obliged to be taken than heretofore,\"\r\nthe community shall now be bound to find one priest only, whose\r\nstipend shall be five marks yearly instead of six as appointed, the\r\nvalue of the property being thus estimated at less than half what it\r\nhad been before.[328]\r\n\r\nIn Buckinghamshire there were at the time between 180 and 200\r\nbenefices, in the county of Bedford some 120 and in Berkshire 162.\r\nFrom these a calculation of the probable number of incumbents carried\r\noff in 1349 by the sickness may be made.\r\n\r\nAs some indication of the state to which these counties were reduced\r\nby the scourge, a petition of the sheriff of Bedfordshire and\r\nBuckinghamshire, made to the King in 1353, may be here mentioned.\r\nHe declared that it was impossible then to pay into the Exchequer\r\nthe old sums for the farming of the hundreds, which had been usual\r\n\"before the late pestilence.\" Coming before the King in February,\r\n1353, he not only urged his petition, but claimed to have £66\r\nreturned to him, which he had paid over and above his receipts. For\r\nthe years 1351 and 1352 he had paid £132 for these rents, as had\r\nbeen usual since 1342; but he claimed that \"from the time of the\r\npestilence the bailiffs of the hundreds had been unwilling to take\r\nthem on such terms.\" An inquiry by a jury was held in both counties,\r\nand it was declared \"that since 1351 the bailiffs of the hundreds had\r\nbeen able to obtain nothing for certain—except what they could get\r\nby extortion—from the county. Further, that the inhabitants of the\r\nsaid county were now [p179] so diminished and impoverished that the\r\nbailiffs were able to get nothing for the farms in that year, 1351.\"\r\nIn the same way also John Chastiloun, the sheriff, had received\r\nnothing whatever for his office. In the end the sum claimed was\r\nallowed.[329]\r\n\r\nIn the Canterbury portion of the county of Kent there were some\r\n280 benefices, which number may form the basis for a calculation\r\nof the death roll. The condition to which this portion of England\r\nwas reduced may be estimated from one or two examples. In 1352 the\r\nprioress and nuns of the house of St. James' outside Canterbury\r\nwere allowed to be free from the tax of a fifteenth granted to\r\nthe King, because they were reduced to such destitution that they\r\nhad nothing beyond what was necessary to support them.[330] Even\r\nthe Cathedral priory of Christchurch itself had to plead poverty.\r\nAbout 1350 the monks addressed petitions to the Bishop of Rochester\r\nasking him to give them the church of Westerham \"to help them to\r\nmaintain their traditional hospitality.\" They say that \"by the great\r\npestilence affecting man and beast,\" they are unable to do this, and\r\nas arguments to induce the Bishop to allow this impropriation, they\r\nstate that they have lost 257 oxen, 511 cows, and 4,585 sheep, worth\r\ntogether £792 12s. 6d. Further they state that \"1,212 acres of land,\r\nformerly profitable, are inundated by the sea,\" apparently from want\r\nof labourers to maintain the sea walls.[331] [p180]\r\n\r\nThe neighbouring county of Sussex, at the time of the appearance of\r\nthe disease, counted some 320 benefices. From the Patent Rolls it\r\nappears that in 1349 the King presented to as many as 26 livings\r\nin the county; amongst these no less than five were at Hastings,\r\nat All Saints', St. Clement's, St. Leonards, and two at the Free\r\nChapel.[332]\r\n\r\nIn Hampshire, including the Isle of Wight, the average annual\r\nnumber of appointments to benefices for three years previous to\r\nthe pestilence was 21; in 1349 no fewer than 228 institutions are\r\nregistered, so that it may fairly be said that over 200 beneficed\r\nclergy were carried off by the sickness.\r\n\r\nIn the county of Surrey the total number of institutions in 1349\r\nwas as high as 92, against a previous average of a little over nine\r\nyearly, so that here, as in Hants, the number of vacancies of livings\r\nwas this year increased tenfold. It may fairly be argued that of\r\nthe number 92, some 80, at least, of the vacancies were caused by\r\nthe epidemic. Several examples have already been given of the havoc\r\nwrought by the epidemic in religious houses in which it had effected\r\nan entrance. Where the head of a community was carried off, it is\r\npractically certain many of the members also would have perished,\r\nand it can be doubted by no one who examines the facts that the\r\npestilence was not only terrible at the time, but had a lasting and\r\npermanent effect upon the state of the monastic houses. This point\r\nmay be illustrated by some of the monasteries of the diocese of\r\nWinchester.\r\n\r\nIn the city itself the prior of St. Swithun's and the abbess of St.\r\nMary's Benedictine convent both died, and there is evidence that a\r\nlarge proportion of both these communities must have perished at\r\nthe same time, as well as many at the abbey of Hyde. To take the\r\nCathedral of St. Swithun's first. In 1325, four and twenty years\r\nbefore the great mortality, the monks in the house were 64 in\r\nnumber.[333] Of these the 12 juniors on the list had not at that\r\ntime received the subdiaconate. The 34th in order in the community\r\nhad been ordained deacon on December 19th, 1310, and all the thirty\r\nbelow him were his juniors. It is fair to consider that about 60 was\r\nthe normal number previous to the year 1349.[334] After that date\r\nthey were [p181] reduced to a number which varied between 35 and\r\n40. In 1387 William of Wykeham exhorted the community to use every\r\neffort to get up their strength to the original 60 members[335]; but\r\nnotwithstanding all their endeavours they were on Wykeham's death, in\r\nA.D., 1404, only 42. At Bishop Wayneflete's election, in 1447, there\r\nwere only 39 monks; three years later only 35; and in A.D. 1487 their\r\nnumber had fallen to 30, at which figure it remained till the final\r\ndissolution of the house in the reign of Henry VIII.[336]\r\n\r\nThe neighbouring Abbey of Hyde, a house of considerable importance,\r\nwith a community of probably between thirty and forty monks, a\r\ncentury later had fallen to only twenty. In 1488 it had risen to\r\ntwenty-four, and eight of these had joined within the previous three\r\nyears. At the beginning of the 16th century, in 1509, the community\r\nagain consisted of twenty; but on the eve of the final destruction\r\nof the abbey there are some signs of a recovery, the house then\r\nconsisting of twenty-six members, four of whom were novices. So\r\nimpoverished was the house by the consequences of the great mortality\r\nthat in 1352 the community were forced in order \"to [p182] avoid,\"\r\nas they say, \"the final destruction of their house,\" and \"on account\r\nof their pitiful poverty and want, to relieve their absolute\r\nnecessity,\" to surrender their possessions into the hands of Bishop\r\nEdyndon.[337]\r\n\r\nFinancial difficulties also overwhelmed and nearly brought to ruin\r\nthe Benedictine Convent of St. Mary's, which was reduced to about one\r\nhalf their former number. To the same generous benefactor, Bishop\r\nEdyndon, they were indebted for their escape from extinction. In\r\nfact, it would appear that at this time many, if not most, of the\r\nreligious houses of the diocese were protected and supported by the\r\nliberality of the Bishop and his relatives, whom he interested in\r\nthe work of preserving from threatened destruction these monastic\r\nestablishments. In the document by which the nuns of St. Mary's\r\nacknowledge Bishop Edyndon as their second founder, they say that \"he\r\ncounted it a pious and pleasing thing mercifully to come to their\r\nassistance when overwhelmed by poverty, and when, in these days,\r\nevil doing was on the increase and the world was growing worse, they\r\nwere brought to the necessity of secret begging. It was at such a\r\ntime that the same father, with the eye of compassion, seeing that\r\nfrom the beginning our monastery was slenderly provided with lands\r\nand possessions, and that now we and our house, by the barrenness of\r\nour land, by the destruction of our woods, and by the diminution or\r\ntaking away from the monastery of due and appointed rents, because\r\nof the dearth of tenants carried off by the unheard-of and unwonted\r\npestilence,\" came to our assistance to avert our entire undoing.[338]\r\n\r\nSix months later the nuns of Romsey, in almost the same words,\r\nacknowledged their indebtedness to the Bishop.[339] Here the results\r\nof the pestilence upon the convent, as regards numbers, are even\r\nmore remarkable than [p183] in the instances already given. At the\r\nelection of an abbess in A.D. 1333 there were present to record their\r\nvotes 90 nuns. Early in May, 1349—that is only 16 years later—the\r\nabbess died, for the royal assent was given to the election of her\r\nsuccessor, Joan Gerneys, on May 7th of that year.[340] What happened\r\nto the community can be gathered by the fact that in 1478 their\r\nnumber is found reduced to 18, and they never rose above 25 until\r\ntheir final suppression.\r\n\r\nThe various bodies of friars must have suffered quite as severely\r\nas the rest of the clergy. It is, however, very difficult to\r\nobtain any definite information about these mendicant orders; but\r\nsome slight indication of the dearth of members they must have\r\nexperienced at this period in common with all other bodies in\r\nEngland, ecclesiastical and lay, is to be found in the episcopal\r\nregisters of the period. In the diocese of Winchester, for example,\r\nthe Augustinians had only one convent, at Winchester. From September,\r\n1346, to June, 1348, they presented four subjects for ordination\r\nto the priesthood; from that time till Bishop Edyndon's death, in\r\nOctober, 1366, only two more were ordained, both on 22nd December,\r\n1358. The Friars Minor had two houses, one at Winchester, the\r\nother at Southampton; for these, in 1347 and 1348, three priests\r\nwere ordained. From that time till the 21st of December, 1359, no\r\nmore received orders. Then two were made priests; but no further\r\nordinations are recorded until after Bishop Edyndon's death. The same\r\nextraordinary want of subjects appears in the case of the Carmelites.\r\nWith them, between 1346 and 1348, eleven subjects received the\r\npriesthood. The next Carmelite ordained was in December, 1357, and\r\nonly three in all were made priests between the great plague and\r\nthe close of the year 1366. The Dominicans also had only one priest\r\nordained in ten years, that is in the period from March, 1349, to\r\nDecember, 1359.\r\n\r\nOwing to the mortality having swept away so many of [p184] their\r\ntenants, and other consequences traceable to the mortality, the\r\npriory of St. Swithun's became heavily involved in debt. On the\r\n31st of December, 1352, Bishop Edyndon determined to make a careful\r\ninquiry into the state of his cathedral monastery, and wrote to that\r\neffect to the prior and convent. He says in his letter that he has\r\nheard how the temporalities have suffered severely \"in these days,\r\nboth by the deaths of tenants of the church, from which there has\r\ncome a grave diminution of rent and services, and from various other\r\ncauses unknown, and that it is burdened with excessive debts.\" As he\r\nhimself was occupied in the King's service, he proposes to send some\r\nofficers to inquire into these matters, and begs them to assist them\r\nin every way. He further says that it is reported to him \"that in\r\nthis our church the former fervour of devotion in the divine service\r\nand regular observance has grown lukewarm;\" that both the monastery\r\nand out-buildings are falling to ruins; that \"guests are not received\r\nthere so honourably as before; on which account we wonder not a\r\nlittle,\" he continues, \"and are troubled the more because so far you\r\nhave not informed us\" of these things. He appoints January 21, 1353,\r\nfor the beginning of the inquiry, and in a second document names\r\nthree priests, including a canon of the diocese of Sarum and the\r\nrector of Froyle, in Hampshire, to hold it.[341]\r\n\r\nShortly after this, on January 14, 1353, Bishop Edyndon ordered a\r\nsimilar inquiry to be made as to the state of Christchurch priory,\r\nwhich was also heavily in debt.[342] That the house had been\r\nseriously diminished in members seems more than probable in view of\r\nthe fact that from the date of the plague till the beginning of 1366\r\nno subject of the house was ordained priest.\r\n\r\nThe hospital of Sandown, in Surrey, was left, as before said, without\r\na single inmate. On June 1, 1349, the Bishop, in giving it into the\r\ncare of a priest named William de [p185] Coleton, says: \"Since all\r\nand everyone of the brethren of the Hospital of the blessed Mary\r\nMagdalene of Sandown, in our diocese, to whom on a vacancy of the\r\noffice of Prior, or guardian, the election belonged, are dead in\r\nthe mortality of men raging in the kingdom of England, none of the\r\nbrethren being left, the said hospital is destitute both of head and\r\nmembers.\"[343]\r\n\r\nThe same state of financial ruin is known to have existed in the case\r\nof Shireborne priory. On 8th June, 1350, Bishop Edyndon wrote to the\r\nabbot and convent of St. Vigor of Cérisy saying that Shireborne,\r\nwhich was said to be a dependency of the abbey, was fallen into great\r\npoverty. \"The oblations of sacrifices had ceased, and from very\r\nhunger the devotion of priests was grown tepid; the buildings were\r\nfalling to ruins, and its fruitful fields, now that the labourers\r\nwere carried off, were barren.\" The priory could not hope, he\r\nconsidered, to recover \"in their days,\" and so, with the consent of\r\nthe patron, he requested the abbot to recall four of the monks to the\r\nabbey, the priory then containing the superior and seven religious.\r\nThe same day a letter was sent to the prior of Shireborne directing\r\nthat this should be at once carried out.[344]\r\n\r\nOne fact will be sufficient to show the state to which the diocese\r\nwas reduced after the plague had passed. On the 9th of April, 1350,\r\nthe Bishop issued a general admonition to his clergy as to residence\r\non their cures. It had been reported to him, he says, that some\r\npriests, to whom the cure of souls had been committed, \"neglecting,\r\nwith danger to many souls,\" this charge, \"have most shamefully\r\nabsented themselves for their churches,\" so that \"even the divine\r\nsacrifices,\" for which these churches had been built and adorned,\r\n\"had been left off.\" The sacred buildings were, he says, \"left to\r\nbirds and beasts,\" and they neither kept the church in repair nor\r\nrepaired what was falling to ruins, \"on which account the general\r\nstate of the churches is one [p186] of ruin.\" He consequently orders\r\nall priests to return to their cures within a month, or to get proper\r\nand fitting substitutes.[345]\r\n\r\nIn the June of the same year (1350) a special monition was issued\r\nto William Elyot, rector of a church near Basingstoke, at once to\r\nreturn to his living, as the church had been left without service. A\r\nmonth later, on the 10th of July, 1350, the Bishop published a joint\r\nletter of the Archbishop and Bishops ordering priests to serve the\r\nchurches at the previous stipends, and he adds that every parish\r\nchurch must be contented with one chaplain only, \"until those parish\r\nand prebendal churches and chapels which are now, or may hereafter\r\nbe, unserved, be properly supplied with chaplains.\"[346]\r\n\r\nThere are many indications of the misery and suffering to which the\r\npeople generally were reduced in these parts. Thus, for example, the\r\nKing, whose compassion and tenderness, by the way, are very rarely\r\nmanifested, remits the tax of the 15th due to him in the case of his\r\ntenants in the Isle of Wight. This he does, \"taking into account the\r\ndivers burdens which\" these tenants have borne, \"for the men and\r\ntenants of our manors now dead and whose lands and tenements by their\r\ndeaths have come into our hands.\"[347] A glance at the institutions\r\nto benefices in the island will show that at one time or another\r\nduring the prevalence of the plague nearly every living became\r\nvacant, and some more than once.\r\n\r\nThe town of Portsmouth, also, was forced to plead poverty, and ask\r\nthe remission of a tax of £12 12s. 2d., because \"by the attacks\r\nof our enemies the French, fires, and other adverse chances the\r\ninhabitants were very much depressed.\"[348] That the \"other adverse\r\nchances\" refers to the desolation caused by the pestilence appears\r\n[p187] from another grant, of relief for eight years, made to the\r\ntown the previous year, because it was so impoverished \"both by the\r\npestilence and by the burning and destruction of the place by our\r\nenemies.\"[349]\r\n\r\nThe neighbouring island of Hayling was in even a worse plight after\r\nthe pestilence. \"The inhabitants of Stoke, Eaststoke, Northwood,\r\nSouthwood, Mengham, Weston, and Hayling, in the island of Hayling,\r\nhave shown to us,\" says the King, in 1352, \"that they are greatly\r\nimpoverished by expenses and burdens for the defence of the said\r\nisland against the attacks of the French, and by the great wasting\r\nof their lands by inroad of the sea, as well as by the abandonment\r\nof the island by some who were wont to bear the burdens of the said\r\nisland. Those consequently who are left would have to pay more than\r\ndouble the usual tax were it now levied. Moreover since the greatest\r\npart of the said population died whilst the plague was raging, now,\r\nthrough the dearth of servants and labourers, the inhabitants are\r\noppressed and daily are falling most miserably into greater poverty.\r\nTaking into account all this, the King orders the collector of taxes\r\nfor Southampton not to require the old amount, but to be content with\r\nonly £6 15s. 7-1/4d.[350] Three years later Hayling priory, which as\r\none of the alien houses then in the King's hands had been paying a\r\nlarge rent into the royal exchequer in place of sending it over to\r\ntheir foreign mother house, was relieved by the King of the payment\r\nof £57, as it was \"much oppressed in these days.\"[351]\r\n\r\nEven in Winchester difficulties as to taxation, at this time, led to\r\nmany people leaving the city. Citizens, as the document relating to\r\nit declares, who have long lived there, \"because of the taxation and\r\nother burdens now pressing on them, are leaving the said city with\r\nthe property they have made in the place, so as not to contribute\r\n[p188] to the said taxes. And they, betaking themselves to other\r\nlocalities in the county, are leaving the said city desolate and\r\nwithout inhabitants to our (_i.e._, the King's) great hurt.\"[352]\r\n\r\nAn _Inquisitio post mortem_ for a Hampshire manor, taken in 1350,\r\nshows the fall in prices of lands and produce after the mortality.\r\nEighty acres of arable land, which in normal times had been let for\r\ntwo marks (13s. 4d.), now produced only 6s. 8d., or just one-half,\r\nbeing at the rent of 1d. per acre in place of two pence. The same\r\nfall is to be seen in the rent of meadow land, which let now at 6d.\r\ninstead of a shilling, and in the value of woods, 20 acres fetching\r\nonly 20d., in the place of double that amount, which it used to\r\nproduce.[353]\r\n\r\nIn Surrey it is the same story. In the inquiry made as to the lands\r\nof William de Hastings, on the 12th March, 1349, it is declared that\r\nthe tenements let on the manor produce only thirty-six shillings\r\nbecause all the tenants but ten are dead, \"and the other houses\r\nstand and remain empty for want of tenants, and so are of no value\r\nthis year.\" In another case a watermill is held by the jury to be\r\nworthless because \"all the tenants who used it were dead.\" It had\r\nremained empty and no one could be found to rent it. Of the land 300\r\nacres cannot be let. The court of the manor produced nothing, because\r\nall are dead, and there are no receipts from the free tenants, which\r\nused to amount to £6 a year, \"because almost all the tenants on the\r\nsaid manor are dead, and their tenements remain empty for want of\r\nsome to rent them.\"[354]\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any definite information about the institutions\r\nof clergy in the county of Gloucester, it may be roughly estimated,\r\nfrom the number of benefices, that between 160 and 170 beneficed\r\nclergy in this district perished in the epidemic. Like other\r\nreligious houses, the [p189] abbey of Winchcombe was impoverished\r\nby the consequences of the great mortality, and some years after\r\nit was unable to support its community and meet its liabilities.\r\n\"By defect in past administration,\" as the document puts it, \"it is\r\nburdened with great debt, and its state, from various causes, is so\r\nmiserably impoverished that it is necessary to place the custody of\r\nthe temporalities in the hands of a commission\" appointed by the\r\ncrown.[355]\r\n\r\nThat this is no exaggerated view of the difficulties which beset the\r\nlanded proprietors at the time, and that the origin of the misery\r\nmust be sought for in the great pestilence, a passage in Smyth's\r\n_Lives of the Berkeleys_ may help to show:—\"In the 23rd of this\r\nKing,\" he writes, \"so great was the plague within this lord's manor\r\nof Hame (in Gloucestershire) that so many workfolks as amounted to\r\n1,144 days' work were hired to gather in the corn of that manor\r\nalone, as by their deaths fell into the lord's hands, or else were\r\nforsaken by them.\"[356]\r\n\r\nThe priory of Lanthony, near Gloucester, was brought to such straits\r\nthat the community were forced to apply to the Bishop of Hereford\r\nto grant them one of the benefices in his diocese. They have been,\r\nthey say, so situated on the high road as to be obliged to give great\r\nhospitality at all times to rich and poor. Their property, in great\r\npart, was in Ireland, and it had been much diminished in value by the\r\nstate of the country. The house was at this time, October 15th, 1351,\r\nso impoverished by this and by a great fire that, without aid, they\r\ncould not keep up their charity. For \"the rents of the priory and the\r\nservices, which the tenants and natives, or serfs of the said house\r\nliving on their domain, have been wont yearly, and even daily, to pay\r\nand perform for the religious serving God there, now, through the\r\npestilence and unwonted mortality by which the people of the kingdom\r\nof England have been [p190] afflicted, and, as is known, almost\r\nblotted out, are for the greater part irreparably lost.\"[357]\r\n\r\nSome few years after the plague had passed an inquisition held at\r\nGloucester as to the state of the priory of Horsleigh reveals the\r\nfact that a great number of the tenants on the estate had died.\r\nHorsleigh was at the period a cell of the priory of Bruton, in\r\nSomerset, and the question before the jury at this inquiry was as to\r\nthe dilapidations caused by the prior or minister of the dependent\r\ncell. They first found that all revenues from the estates at\r\nHorsleigh, after a reasonable amount had been allowed for the support\r\nof the prior and his brethren living in the cell, should be paid to\r\nthe head house of Bruton. This the then prior, one Henry de Lyle,\r\nhad not done. He had, moreover, dissipated the goods of his house by\r\ncutting down timber and underwood and selling cattle. Amongst the\r\nrest he is declared to have sold \"eighty oxen and cows which had come\r\nto the house as mortuaries or heriots of tenants who had died in the\r\ngreat pestilence.\"[358]\r\n\r\nDugdale, in his history of the county, prints some 175 lists of\r\nincumbents of Warwickshire livings. In 76 cases there is noted a\r\nchange at this period, and in several instances more than once is a\r\nnew incumbent appointed to a living within a short period, so that in\r\nall there are some 93 institutions recorded.\r\n\r\nA glimpse of the state to which the county generally was reduced\r\nis afforded by some _Inquisitiones post mortem_. As soon after the\r\nplague as 1350, at Wappenbury in Warwickshire, three houses, three\r\ncottages, and 20 acres of land are described as valueless and lying\r\nvacant, because of the pestilence late past. At Alcester, on the\r\nestate of a man who died June 20th, 1349, rents are not received and\r\ntenements are in hand, \"for the most [p191] part, through the death\r\nof the holders.\" Again, at Wilmacott, an inquiry was held as to the\r\nproperty of Elizabeth, daughter of John de Wyncote, who died 10th\r\nAugust, 1349. It is declared that the mother died on 10th June, and\r\nthe daughter two months later, whilst the great part of the land is\r\nin the hand of the owner \"by the death of the tenants in this present\r\npestilence.\"[359]\r\n\r\nOn the estate of one who died in December, 1350, it is certified that\r\nthere used to be nine villains, each farming half a virgate of land,\r\nfor which they paid eight shillings a year. Five of these had died,\r\nand their land since had been lying idle and uncultivated. On another\r\nportion of the same two out of four tenants, who had six acres of\r\nland each, have been carried off.\r\n\r\nOn the manor of Whitchurch, owned by Margaret de la Beche, who died\r\nin the October of the plague year, 1349, it is noted that there are\r\nno court fees, as all the tenements are in hand. And in May, 1351,\r\nof another Oxfordshire estate it is said that eight claimants out\r\nof eighteen were dead, and no one was forthcoming to take the land;\r\nwhilst on the same, out of six native tenants, who had each paid\r\n14 shillings, three are gone, and their land has since remained\r\nuntilled.[360]\r\n\r\nOne or two examples may be given of the difficulties subsequently\r\nexperienced by the religious houses. The year after the plague\r\nhad passed the Cistercian abbey of Bruerne was forced to seek the\r\nKing's protection against the royal provisors and the quartering of\r\nroyal servants upon them. This Edward granted, \"because it was in\r\nsuch a bad state, that otherwise in a short time there would follow\r\nthe total destruction of the said abbey, and the dispersal of the\r\nmonks.\"[361] Even this protection, however, did not entirely mend\r\nmatters, for three years later, \"to [p192] avoid total ruin,\" the\r\ncustody of the abbey was handed over to three commissioners.\"[362]\r\n\r\nSt. Frideswide's, Oxford, was in much the same case. In May, 1349,\r\nas we may suppose from the death of the superior during the time of\r\nthe epidemic at Oxford, the plague had visited the monastery, and\r\nhad, in all probability, carried off many of its inmates. The deaths\r\nof many of its tenants, moreover, must have gravely affected its\r\nfinancial condition, and three years later it was found necessary\r\nto put the temporalities in the hands of a commission. \"By want of\r\ngood government,\" it is said, \"and through casual misfortunes, coming\r\nupon the said priory, both because of the debts by which it is much\r\nembarrassed, and for other causes,\" it is reduced to such a state\r\nthat it might easily lead to the dispersal of the canons and the\r\ntotal destruction of the house.[363]\r\n\r\nOf the tenants of one manor belonging to a religious house in the\r\ncounty of Oxford, it is said \"that in the time of the mortality of\r\nmen or the pestilence, which was in the year 1349, there hardly\r\nremained two tenants on the said manor. These would have left had\r\nnot brother Nicholas de Lipton, then abbot, made new agreements with\r\nthese and other incoming tenants.\"[364]\r\n\r\nTo take but two instances more in other parts of England.\r\n\r\nThe year after the plague was over, in 1351, the abbey of Barlings\r\nhad to plead poverty and to beg for the remission of a tax. It is\r\ntrue, they urge the building of their new church, but likewise\r\ndeclare that they have been \"impoverished by many other causes.\" An\r\n_Inquisitio post mortem_ gives the same picture. Two carucates of\r\nland, for example, brought in only forty shillings, on account of\r\nthe pestilence and general poverty and deaths of the tenants. \"For a\r\nsimilar reason,\" a mill, [p193] which used to produce £2 in rent,\r\nnow yields nothing; and so on throughout every particular of the\r\nlarge estate.\r\n\r\nIn this part of the country, too, the King's officer experienced the\r\ngreatest difficulties in getting his dues, and the Escheator pleads,\r\nin mitigation of a small return, that during the whole of 1350\r\ntenements have been standing empty, in Gayton, near Towcester, in\r\nWeedon, in Weston, and in Morton, ten miles from Brackley, as tenants\r\ncannot be found \"by reason of the mortality.\" He further excuses\r\nhimself for not levying on the lands and goods of the people \"on\r\naccount of the pestilence.\"[365]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[303] B.

At present we do\r\nnot possess data sufficient to enable us to form the basis of any\r\ncalculation worthy of the name. From the Subsidy Roll of 1377—or\r\nsome 27 years after the great mortality—it has been estimated that\r\nthe population at the close of the reign of Edward III. was about\r\n2,350,000 in England and Wales. The intervening years were marked\r\nby several more or less severe outbreaks of Eastern plague; and one\r\nyear, 1361, would have been accounted most calamitous had not the\r\nmemory of the fatal year 1349 somewhat overshadowed it. At the same\r\ntime the French war continued to tax the strength of the country and\r\nlevy its tithe upon the lives of Englishmen. It may consequently be\r\nbelieved that the losses during the thirty years which followed the\r\nplague of 1349 would be sufficient to prevent any actual increase\r\nof the population, and that somewhere about two and a half millions\r\nof people were left in the country after the [p195] epidemic\r\nhad ceased. If this be so, it is probable that previously to the\r\nmortality the entire population of the country consisted of from four\r\nto five millions, half of whom perished in the fatal year.[366]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, whilst apparently allowing that about one-half\r\nof the population perished, so eminent an authority as the late\r\nProfessor Thorold Rogers held that the population of England in\r\n1349 could hardly have been greater than two-and-a-half millions,\r\nand \"probably was not more than two millions.\"[367] The most recent\r\nauthority, Dr. Cunningham, thinks that \"the results (_i.e._, of an\r\ninquiry into the number of the population) which are of a somewhat\r\nnegative character, may be stated as follows: (i.), that the\r\npopulation was pretty nearly stationary at over two millions from\r\n1377 to the Tudors; (ii.), that circumstances did not favour rapid\r\nincrease of population between 1350 and 1377; (iii.), that the\r\ncountry was not incapable of sustaining a much larger population in\r\nthe earlier part of Edward III.'s reign than it could maintain in\r\nthe time of Henry VI.\"[368] Thus the estimate first given, of the\r\npopulation previous to the Black Death, may be taken as substantially\r\nthe same as that adopted by Dr. Cunningham. Mr. Thorold Rogers,\r\non the other hand, without entering into the question of figures,\r\nviews the problem altogether from the standpoint of the land, the\r\ncultivated portion of which he considers incapable of supporting a\r\nlarger population than he names.\r\n\r\nIn the country at large the most striking and immediate effect\r\nof the mortality was to bring about nothing less than a complete\r\nsocial revolution. Everywhere, although the well-to-do people were\r\nnot exempt from the contagion, it was the poor who were the chief\r\nsufferers. \"It is well [p196] known,\" wrote the late Professor\r\nThorold Rogers, \"that the Black Death, in England at least, spared\r\nthe rich and took the poor. And no wonder. Living as the peasantry\r\ndid in close, unclean huts, with no rooms above ground, without\r\nwindows, artificial light, soap, linen; ignorant of certain\r\nvegetables, constrained to live half the year on salt meat; scurvy,\r\nleprosy, and other diseases, which are engendered by hard living and\r\nthe neglect of every sanitary precaution, were endemic among the\r\npopulation.[369]\r\n\r\nThe obvious and undoubted effect of the great mortality among the\r\nworking classes was to put a premium upon the services of those that\r\nsurvived. From all parts of England comes the same cry for workers to\r\ngather in the harvests, to till the ground, and to guard the cattle.\r\nFor years the same demands are re-echoed until the landowners learnt\r\nfrom experience that the old methods of cultivation, and the old\r\ntenures of land, had been rendered impossible by the great scourge\r\nthat had swept over the land.\r\n\r\nIt was a hard time for the landowners, who up to this had had it,\r\nroughly speaking, all their own away. With rents falling to half\r\ntheir value, with thousands of acres of land lying untilled and\r\nvalueless, with cottages, mills and houses without tenants, and\r\norchards, gardens, and fields waste and desolate, there came a\r\ncorresponding rise in the prices of commodities. Everything that\r\nthe landowner had to buy rose at once, as Professor Thorold Rogers\r\npointed out, \"50, 100, and even 200 per cent.\" Iron, salt and\r\nclothing doubled in value, and fish—and in particular herrings, which\r\nformed so considerable a part of the food of that generation—became\r\ndear beyond the reach of the multitude. \"At that time,\" writes\r\nWilliam Dene, the [p197] contemporary monk of Rochester, \"there was\r\nsuch a dearth and want of fish that people were obliged to eat meat\r\non the Wednesdays, and a command was issued that four herrings should\r\nbe sold for a penny. But in Lent there was still such a want of fish\r\nthat many, who had been wont to live well, had to content themselves\r\nwith bread and potage.\"[370]\r\n\r\nThen that which had been specially the scourge of the people at\r\nlarge began to be looked upon as likely to prove a blessing in\r\ndisguise. The landowner's need was recognised as the labourers'\r\nopportunity, upon which they were not slow to seize. Wages everywhere\r\nrose to double the previous rate and more. In vain did the King and\r\nCouncil strive to prevent this by legislation, forbidding either the\r\nlabourer to demand, or the master to pay, more than the previous\r\nwage for work done. From the first the Act was inoperative, and the\r\nconstant repetition of the royal commands, addressed to all parts of\r\nthe country, as well as the frequent complaints of non-compliance\r\nwith the regulations, are evidence, even if none other existed,\r\nof the futility of the legislation. Even when the King, taking\r\ninto consideration \"that many towns and hamlets, both through the\r\npestilence and other causes, are so impoverished, and that many\r\nothers are absolutely desolate,\" granted, if only the money were paid\r\nhim in three months, that the fines levied on servants and others for\r\ndemanding excessive wages, and on masters for giving them, might be\r\nallowed to go in relief of the tax of a tenth and fifteenth due to\r\nhim,[371] the justices appointed to obtain the money plead that they\r\n\"cannot and have not been able to levy any of these penalties.\"[372]\r\nThe truth seems to be that masters generally pleaded the excessive\r\nwages they were called upon to pay, as an excuse for not finding\r\nmoney to meet the royal demands, and it was for this reason rather\r\nthan out of [p198] consideration for the pockets of the better\r\nclasses that Edward issued his proclamations to restrain the rise\r\nof wages. But he was quickly forced to understand \"that workmen,\r\nservants, and labourers publicly disregarded his ordinances\" as to\r\nwages and payments, and demanded, in spite of them, prices for their\r\nservices as great as during the pestilence and after it, and even\r\nhigher. For disobedience to the royal orders regulating wages the\r\nKing charged his judges to imprison all whom they might find guilty.\r\nEven this coercion was found to be no real remedy, but rather a\r\nmeans of aggravating the evil, since districts where his policy was\r\ncarried out were quickly found to be plunged in greater poverty by\r\nthe imprisonment of those who could work, and of those who dared to\r\npay the market price for labour.[373]\r\n\r\nKnighton thus describes the situation:—\"The King sent into each\r\ncounty of the kingdom orders that harvesters and other workmen should\r\nnot obtain more than they were wont to have, under penalties laid\r\ndown in the statute made for the purpose. But labourers were so\r\nelated and contentious that they did not pay attention to the command\r\nof the King; and if anyone wanted to hire them he was forced to pay\r\nthem what was asked, and so he had his choice either to lose his\r\nharvest and crops, or give in to the proud and covetous desire of the\r\nworkmen. When this became known to the King, he levied heavy fines\r\nupon the abbots, priors, and the higher and lesser lords, as well\r\nas upon the greater and smaller landowners in the country, because\r\nthey had not obeyed his orders, and had given higher wages to their\r\nlabourers; from some he exacted 100s., from some 40s., and from some\r\n20s., and indeed from each as much as he could be made to pay. And he\r\ntook from every carucate throughout the whole kingdom 20s. besides a\r\nfifteenth.\r\n\r\n\"Then the King arrested very many labourers and put [p199] them in\r\nprison; and many fled and hid themselves in forests and woods for the\r\ntime, and those who were caught were fined more severely still. And\r\nthe greater number were sworn not to take higher daily wages than was\r\ncustomary, and were so liberated from prison. In like manner he acted\r\ntowards the artificers in towns and cities.\"[374]\r\n\r\nTo this account of the labour difficulties which followed on the\r\nmortality may be added the relation of the Rochester contemporary,\r\nWilliam Dene. \"So great was the want of labourers and workmen of\r\nevery art and craft,\" in those days, he writes, \"that a third\r\npart and more of the land throughout the entire kingdom remained\r\nuncultivated. Labourers and skilled workmen became so rebellious that\r\nneither the King, nor the law, nor the justices, the guardians of the\r\nlaw, were able to punish them.\"[375] Many instances are to be found\r\nin the public documents at the period of combinations of workmen for\r\nthe purpose of securing higher wages, and of their refusal to work at\r\nthe old rate of payment customary before the great mortality had made\r\nthe services of the survivors more valuable. This, in the language of\r\nthe statute, is called \"the malice of servants in husbandry.\" In the\r\nsame way tenants who had survived the visitation refused to pay the\r\nold rents and threatened to leave their holdings unless substantial\r\nreductions were made by their landlords. Thus, in an instance already\r\ngiven, the landowner remitted a third part of the rent of his\r\ntenants, \"because they would have gone off and left their holdings\r\nempty unless they had obtained this reduction.\"[376]\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of the great mortality among small tenant farmers\r\nand the labouring classes generally, and forced by the failure of\r\nlegislation to practically cope with the \"strike\" organised by the\r\nsurvivors, the landowners quickly despaired of carrying on the\r\ntraditional system of [p200] cultivation with their own stock\r\nunder bailiffs. Professor Thorold Rogers has pointed out that \"very\r\nspeedily after the plague, this system of farming by bailiff was\r\ndiscontinued, and that of farming on lease adopted.\" The difficulty\r\nexperienced by the tenant of finding capital to work the farms at\r\nfirst led to the institution of the stock and seed lease, which,\r\nafter lasting till about the close of the fourteenth century, gave\r\nplace to the ordinary land lease, with, of course, a certain fixity\r\nof tenure, which at this day we do not associate with that form of\r\nlease. Some landowners tried, with more or less success, to continue\r\nthe old system; but these formed the exception, and by the beginning\r\nof the next century the whole tenure of land had been changed in\r\nEngland by the great mortality of 1349, and by the operation of the\r\n\"trades unions,\" which sprung up at once among the survivors, and\r\nwhich are designated, in the statute against them, as \"alliances,\r\ncovines, congregations, chapters, ordinances and oaths.\"\r\n\r\nThe people all at once learnt their power, and became masters of\r\nthe situation, and although for the next thirty years the lords and\r\nlandowners fought against the complete overthrow of the mediæval\r\nsystem of serfdom, from the year of the great mortality its fall\r\nwas inevitable, and practical emancipation was finally won by the\r\npopular rising of 1381. Even to the last, however, the landowning\r\nclass appear to have remained in the dark as to the real issues\r\nat stake. They claimed the old labour rents, by which their manor\r\nlands had been worked, as well as the money payments for which\r\nthey had been commuted, and they desired that the old ties of the\r\ntenant in villainage to the soil of his lord should be maintained.\r\nEven Parliament was apparently at fault as to the danger which\r\nthreatened the established system. It is impossible, however, to\r\nread the sermons of the period without seeing how entirely the\r\nclergy were with the people in their determination to secure full\r\nand entire liberty for themselves and their posterity, and it is\r\nprobably to their countenance and advice that the preamble of an\r\n[p201] Act passed in the first year of Richard II. refers when\r\nit says: \"Villains withdraw their services and customs from their\r\nlords, by the comfort and procurement of others, their counsellors,\r\nmaintainers, and abettors, which have taken hire and profit of the\r\nsaid villains and land tenants, by colour of certain exemplifications\r\nmade out of Domesday, and affirm that they are discharged and will\r\nsuffer no distress. Hereupon they gather themselves in great routs,\r\nand argue by such a confederacy that everyone shall resist their\r\nlords by force.\"\r\n\r\nOne result of the change of land tenure should be noticed. Previously\r\nto the great plague of 1349 the land was divided up into small\r\ntenancies. An instance taken by Professor Rogers of a parish, where\r\nevery man held a greater or a less amount of land, is a typical\r\nexample of thousands of manors all over the country. It shows, he\r\nsays, \"how generally the land was distributed,\" and that the small\r\nfarms and portions of land, so remarkable in France at the present\r\nday, did prevail in England five hundred years ago. A great portion\r\nof this land, however, although held by distinct tenants, lay in\r\ncommon, and it is a very general complaint at this period that,\r\nas the fields were undivided, they could not be used except by\r\nthe multitude of tenants, which had been carried off by the great\r\nsickness. To render them profitable, under the condition of things\r\nconsequent upon the new system of farming, these tracts of country\r\nhad to be divided up by the plantation of hedges, which form now so\r\ndistinguishing a mark of the English landscape as compared with that\r\nof a foreign country.\r\n\r\nThe population also having by the operation of the great mortality\r\nbecome already detached from the soil, before the final extinction of\r\nserfdom, their liberation resulted not, as in other countries, in the\r\nestablishment of a large class of peasant proprietors, but in that of\r\na small body of large landowners.\r\n\r\nOf course, again, such a phrase must not be interpreted [p202] in\r\nthe modern sense, whereby a \"landowner\" is an \"owner\" of land in a\r\nway which, in those days of custom and perpetuity of tenure, would\r\nnot have been even understood. The change then effected rendered\r\npossible the character of the land settlement that now prevails.\r\n\r\nSo terrible a mortality cannot but have had its effect and left its\r\ntraces upon the education, arts, and architecture of the country.\r\nIn the first, besides the temporary interference with the education\r\nat the Universities, \"this pestilence forms,\" write the authors of\r\nthe _History of Shrewsbury_, \"a remarkable era in the history of our\r\nlanguage. Before that time, ever since the Conquest, the nobility and\r\ngentry of this country affected to converse in French; children even\r\nconstrued their lessons at school into that language. So, at least,\r\nHigden tells us in his _Polychronicon_. But from the time of 'the\r\nfirst Moreyn,' as Trevisa, his translator, terms it, this 'manner'\r\nwas 'som del ychaungide.' A school-master, named Cornwall, was the\r\nfirst that introduced English into the instruction of his pupils,\r\nand this example was so eagerly followed that by the year 1385,\r\nwhen Trevisa wrote, it had become nearly general. The clergy in all\r\nChristian countries are the chief persons by whom the education of\r\nyouth is conducted, and it is probable that the dreadful scourge of\r\nwhich we have been treating, by carrying off many of those ancient\r\ninstructors, enabled Mr. Cornwall to work a change in the mode of\r\nteaching, which but for that event he would never have been able to\r\neffect, and which has operated so mighty a revolution in our national\r\nliterature.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to architecture, traces of the effects of the great\r\nplague are to be seen in many places. In some cases great additions\r\nto existing buildings, which had only been partially executed, were\r\nput a stop to and never completed. In others they were finished only\r\nafter a change had been made in the style in vogue when the great\r\nmortality swept over the country. Dr. Cox, in his [p203] _Notes on\r\nthe Churches of Derbyshire_, has remarked upon this. \"The awful\r\nshock,\" he says, \"thus given to the nation and to Europe at large\r\nby the Black Death paralyzed for a time every art and industry.\r\nThe science of church architecture, then about at its height, was\r\nsome years recovering from the blow. In some cases, as with the\r\ngrand church of St. Nicholas, Yarmouth, where a splendid pair of\r\nwestern towers were being erected, the work was stopped and never\r\nresumed. . . . The recollection of this great plague often helps\r\nto explain the break that the careful eye not unfrequently notes\r\nin church buildings of the 14th century, and accounts for the\r\nlong period over which the works extended. We believe this to be\r\nthe secret of the long stretch of years that elapsed before the\r\nnoble church of Tideswell was completed in that century; and it\r\nalso affords a clue to much other work interrupted, or suddenly\r\nundertaken, in several other fabrics of the country.\"[377] To this\r\nmay be added the fact that the history of stained-glass manufacture\r\nshows the same break with the past at this period. Not only just at\r\nthis time does there appear a gap in the continuity of manufacture,\r\nbut the first examples after the great pestilence manifest a change\r\nin the style which had previously existed.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the mortality among the clergy it has been already\r\nnoted that we have, in many instances, more certain data to work\r\nupon than in the case of the population at large. In each county the\r\nnumber of institutions to benefices during the plague has already\r\nbeen noticed, and in those cases where the actual figure cannot be\r\nascertained from documentary evidence, half the total number of\r\nbenefices has, in accordance with the general result where such\r\nevidence is available, been taken to represent the livings rendered\r\nvacant during that year. From this it would appear that in round\r\nfigures some 5,000 beneficed clergy fell victims to their duty. As\r\n[p204] already pointed out this number in reality represents only\r\na portion of the clerical body; and in any estimate of the whole\r\nallowance must be made for chaplains, chantry priests, religious, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, possible to come to any conclusion as to the\r\nproportion of the beneficed to the unbeneficed clergy only by very\r\nround numbers. Turning to the Winchester registers, for example, we\r\nfind that the average number of priests ordained in the three years\r\nprevious to 1349 was 111.[378] The average number of institutions\r\nto benefices annually during the same period was only twenty-one,\r\nso that these figures taken by themselves seem to show that the\r\nproportion of beneficed to unbeneficed clergy was about one to four.\r\nOn this basis, and assuming the deaths of beneficed clergy to have\r\nbeen about 5,000, the total death roll in the clerical order would be\r\nsome 25,000.\r\n\r\nThis number, although very large, can hardly be considered as\r\nexcessive, when it is remembered that the peculiar nature of their\r\npriestly duties rendered them specially liable to infection; whilst\r\nin the case of the religious, the mere fact of their living together\r\nin community made the spread of the deadly contagion in their ranks a\r\ncertainty. The Bishops were strangely spared; although it is certain\r\nthat they did not shrink from their duty, but according to positive\r\nevidence remained at their posts. To their case are applicable the\r\nlines of the poet upon the like wonderful escape of the Bishop during\r\nthe plague in the last century at Marseilles:—\r\n\r\n \"Why drew Marseilles' good Bishop purer breath\r\n When nature sickened, and each gale was death?\"[379] [p205]\r\n\r\nOn the supposition that five-and-twenty thousand of the clerical\r\nbody fell victims to the epidemic, and estimating that of the\r\nentire population of the country one in every hundred belonged to\r\nthe clergy, and further that the death rate was about equal in both\r\nestates, the total mortality in the country would be some 2,500,000.\r\nThis total is curiously the same as that estimated from the basis of\r\npopulation returns made at the close of the memorable reign of Edward\r\nIII., evidencing, namely, a total population, before the outbreak of\r\nthe epidemic, of some five millions.[380]\r\n\r\nIt remains now to briefly point out some of the undoubted effects,\r\nwhich followed from this great disaster, upon the Church. It is\r\nobvious that the sudden removal of so large a proportion of the\r\nclerical body must have caused a breach in the continuity of the best\r\ntraditions of ecclesiastical usage and teaching. Absolute necessity,\r\nmoreover, compelled the Bishops to institute young and inexperienced,\r\nif not entirely uneducated clerics, to the vacant livings, and this\r\ncannot but have had its effect upon succeeding generations. The\r\nArchbishop of York sought and obtained permission from the Pope to\r\nordain at any time, and to dispense with the usual intervals between\r\nthe sacred orders;—Bishop Bateman, of Norwich, was allowed by Clement\r\nVI to dispense with sixty clerks, who were but twenty-one years of\r\nage, \"though only shavelings,\" and to allow them to hold rectories,\r\nas otherwise the divine offices of the Church would cease altogether\r\nin many places of his diocese.\r\n\r\n\"At that time,\" writes Knighton, the sub-contemporary canon of\r\nLeicester, \"there was everywhere such a dearth of priests that many\r\nchurches were left without the divine offices, mass, matins, vespers,\r\nsacraments, and sacramentals. One could hardly get a chaplain to\r\nserve a [p206] church for less than £10, or 10 marks. And whereas\r\nbefore the pestilence, when there were plenty of priests, anyone\r\ncould get a chaplain for 5 or even 4 marks, or for 2 marks and his\r\nboard,[381] at this time there was hardly a soul who would accept\r\na vicarage for £20, or 20 marks. In a short time after, however, a\r\nlarge number of those whose wives had died in the pestilence came\r\nup to receive orders. Of these many were illiterate and mere laics,\r\nexcept in so far as they knew in a way how to read, although they did\r\nnot understand\" what they read.[382]\r\n\r\nOne instance of the rapidity of promotion, so that benefices\r\nmight not too long remain unfilled, may be given. In the diocese\r\nof Winchester the registers record at this period very numerous\r\nappointments of clerics, not in sacred orders, to benefices. For\r\nexample, in 1349 no fewer than 19 incumbents already appointed to\r\nchurches in the city of Winchester came up for ordination, and eight\r\nin the following year. Of these 27 every one took his various orders\r\nof sub-deacon, deacon, and priest at successive ordinations without\r\nthe normal interval between each step in the sacred ministry.[383]\r\n\r\nTwo examples of the straits to which the Bishops were reduced for\r\npriests are to be found in the registers of the [p207] diocese of\r\nBath and Wells. The one is the admission of a man to the first step\r\nto Orders, in the lifetime of his wife, she giving her consent, and\r\npromising to keep chaste, but not, as was usually required under such\r\ncircumstances, being compelled to enter the cloister, \"because she\r\nwas aged, and could without suspicion remain in the world.\"[384] The\r\nsecond instance in the same register of a difficulty experienced in\r\nfilling up vacancies is the case of a permission given to Adam, the\r\nrector of Hinton Bluet, to say mass on Sundays and feast days in the\r\nchapel of William de Sutton, even although he had before celebrated\r\nthe solemnities of the mass in his church of Hinton.[385]\r\n\r\nAnother curious case, which we may suspect really came from the same\r\ncause, is noted at an ordination held in December, 1352, at Ely. Of\r\nthe four then receiving the priesthood two were monks, and from the\r\nother two an oath of obedience to the Bishop and his successors was\r\nenacted, together with a promise \"that they would serve any parish\r\nchurch to which they might be called.\"[386]\r\n\r\nMany instances could be given of the ignorance consequent upon the\r\nordinations being hurried on, and upon laymen, otherwise unfitted\r\nfor the sacred mission, being too hastily admitted to the vacant\r\ncures. To take but two instances, from Winchester, which may serve\r\nto illustrate this and at the same time to show the zeal with which\r\nthe mediæval Bishops endeavoured to guard against the evil. On 24th\r\nJune, 1385, the illustrious William of Wykeham, Bishop of Winchester,\r\ncaused Sir Roger Dene, Rector of the church of St. Michael, in Jewry\r\nStreet, Winchester, to swear upon the Holy Gospels that he would\r\nlearn within twelve months the articles of faith, the cases reserved\r\nto the Bishop, the Ten Commandments, the seven works of mercy, the\r\nseven mortal sins, the Sacraments of the Church, and the form of\r\nadministering and [p208] conferring them, and also the form of\r\nbaptizing, etc., as contained in the Constitutions of Archbishop\r\nPeckham.[387] The same year, on July 2nd, the Bishop exacted from\r\nJohn Corbet, who on the 2nd of June previous had been instituted to\r\nthe rectory of Bradley, in Hampshire, a similar obligation to learn\r\nthe same, before the feast of St. Michael then next ensuing. In the\r\nformer case Roger Dene had been rector of Ryston, in Norfolk, and had\r\nbeen instituted to his living at Winchester by the Bishop of Norwich\r\nonly on 21st June, 1358, three days before Bishop William of Wykeham\r\nrequired him to enter into the obligation detailed above.[388]\r\n\r\nIt has been already remarked that one obvious result of the great\r\nmortality, so far as the Church is concerned, was the extraordinary\r\ndecrease in the number of candidates for sacred orders. In the\r\nWinchester diocese, for example, the average number of priests\r\nordained in each of the three years preceding 1349 was 111; whilst\r\nin the 15 subsequent years, up to 1365, when Bishop Edyndon died,\r\nthe yearly average was barely 20; and in the thirty-four years, from\r\n1367 to 1400, even with so zealous a prelate as William of Wykeham\r\npresiding over the diocese, the annual average number of ordinations\r\nto the sacred priesthood was only 27; a number which was further\r\ndecreased during the progress of the 15th century.[389]\r\n\r\nThe same striking result of the plague, which cannot but have had\r\na very serious effect upon the Church at large, is manifested\r\nelsewhere. The Ely registers, for example, show that the average\r\nnumber of all those ordained, for the seven years before 1349, was\r\n101-1/2; whilst for the seven years after that date it was but\r\n40-1/2. In 1349 no ordinations whatever apparently were held, and\r\n[p209] the average number of priests ordained yearly, from 1374 to\r\n1394, was only 14. In fact the total number ordained in that period\r\nwas only 282, whilst of these many entered the priesthood for other\r\ndioceses, and more than half, namely 161, were members of the various\r\nreligious orders; so that the ranks of the diocesan clergy of Ely\r\nappear to have received but few recruits during the whole of this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIn the diocese of Hereford, to take another example, previously to\r\n1349, there were some very large ordinations. Thus, in 1346, on\r\nthe 11th of March, 438 people were ordained to various grades in\r\nthe sacred ministry. Of these some 89 received the priesthood, 49\r\nof them being ordained for the diocese of Hereford. Again, on the\r\n10th of June in the same year, Bishop Trileck conferred orders, in\r\nthe parish church of Ledbury, upon 451 candidates, of whom 148 were\r\nmade priests; 56 being intended for his own diocese. Altogether, in\r\nthat year, some 319 priests were ordained by the Bishop; half of\r\nthe number being his own clergy.[390] About the same numbers were\r\nordained in the year of the plague itself, 1349, and 371 in the\r\nfollowing year. In fact, till 1353 the number remains large, but the\r\ngreater portion of those ordained were intended for other dioceses.\r\nThe subjects of the Bishop of Hereford at once show a falling off\r\nsimilar to that noticed in Winchester and Ely. Thus, from 1345 to\r\n1349, the average number of subjects ordained by the Bishop for his\r\nown diocese was 72. In the next five years it was only 34, whilst in\r\nno subsequent year during Bishop Trileck's pontificate did it rise\r\nabove 23.\r\n\r\nThe above three examples will be sufficient to show how seriously\r\nthe great pestilence affected the supply of clergy. The reason is\r\nnot difficult to divine. The great dearth of population created a\r\nproportionate demand upon the services of the survivors to carry on\r\nthe business of the nation, and the greater pressure of business\r\nthus brought [p210] about, and the higher wages to be, in fact,\r\nobtained, in spite of royal prohibitions, were not favourable to the\r\ndevelopment of vocations to the clerical life. The void thus caused\r\nby the overwhelming misfortunes of the great mortality was enlarged\r\nby the exigencies of the English war with France, whilst popular\r\ndisturbances, and the subsequent Wars of the Roses, maintained the\r\nsame causes in operation till far into the reigns of the Tudor\r\nsovereigns.\r\n\r\nTo some extent, the dearth of students at Oxford and Cambridge, which\r\nhas already been referred to, was brought about by the same causes,\r\nand it certainly followed immediately upon the fatal year of 1349. At\r\nOxford, no doubt, the serious disturbances, which took place at this\r\ntime between the students and townsfolk, contributed to aggravate\r\nthe evil. So serious, indeed, had the state of the great centre of\r\nclerical education in England become, in less than six years after\r\nthe pestilence, that the King was compelled to address the Bishops\r\non the subject. He begs them to help in the task of renewing the\r\nUniversity; \"knowing,\" he says, \"how the Catholic faith is chiefly\r\nsupported by the learning of the clergy, and the State governed by\r\ntheir prudence, we earnestly desire that, particularly in our kingdom\r\nof England, the clerical order may be increased in number, morals,\r\nand knowledge.\" But, \"in the city of Oxford, in which the fount\r\nand source of clerical knowledge\" has long existed, owing to the\r\ndisturbances, students have forsaken the place, and Oxford, once so\r\nrenowned, has become \"like a worthless fig-tree without fruit.\"[391]\r\nIt has already been pointed out how, nearly half a century later, the\r\nUniversity had not recovered from the great blow it had received at\r\nthis period.[392] [p211]\r\n\r\nThere seems, indeed, a prevalent misunderstanding in regard to the\r\nrelation, or proportionate numbers, of secular and regular clergy at\r\nthis period, and as to the decline in popularity of the regulars, as\r\npresumed to be evidenced in the number of those who joined them after\r\nthe middle of the fourteenth century. It is assumed that up to that\r\nperiod the regular clergy were, both in numbers and influence, the\r\nchief factors in the ecclesiastical system of England, and that after\r\nthat date they greatly declined in importance, public estimation,\r\nand numbers. As evidence, not only is an actual diminution in mere\r\nnumbers adduced, but also the fact that, after this time, the new\r\nreligious institutions took the form of colleges, not of monasteries.\r\nThe misconception lies first of all in this—that there never was a\r\nperiod of the middle ages in England, nor for the matter of that\r\nabroad, when the regular clergy was the great mainstay of the\r\nChurch, so far, at least, as numbers, external work, and the cure of\r\nsouls are concerned. Writers have allowed their imaginations to be\r\ninfluenced by the magnitude of the great monastic houses, or by the\r\nprominent part taken in the government of the Church by individuals\r\nof eminence, belonging to the ranks of the regular clergy; and\r\nhave not remembered how comparatively few in fact were these great\r\nmonastic centres, and how small a proportion their inmates bore to\r\nthe great body of clergy at large.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to refer, perhaps, to figures to bring this home to\r\nthose who have not devoted special attention to the mediæval period,\r\nor who, having studied it, still somehow fail to realise facts as\r\ndistinct from theories, and to rid themselves of the imaginative\r\nprepossessions with which they entered upon their investigations.\r\nThus, even after the institution of the mendicant orders, and in the\r\nflow of their popularity, the ordinations for the diocese of York, in\r\nthe year 1344-45, show that, whilst the number of priests ordained\r\nwas 271, only 44 were regulars. In the same way, the register of\r\nBishop Stapeldon gives the ordinations [p212] in the diocese of\r\nExeter from 1301 to 1321. During this period 703 seculars were made\r\npriests, against 114 regulars. In both these instances, therefore,\r\nmore than six seculars were ordained for every regular.\r\n\r\nThis has its importance in estimating the change in the direction\r\ngiven to religious foundations noticed above. During the course of\r\nthe thirteenth century, when so strong a current of intellectual\r\nactivity and speculation had set in, the importance of education\r\nto the working clergy—at least to a considerable proportion of\r\nthem—forced itself upon those who were the responsible rulers of\r\nthe Church. The religious houses were in existence, and, either\r\ngreat or small, were spread all over the land; indeed, after the\r\npestilence of 1349, greatly more than sufficed for the number of\r\nvocations in the reduced population. Further, by their foundation\r\nthey were not calculated to furnish the means of meeting the new want\r\nthat was pressing, aggravated as it was by the sudden diminution of\r\nthe pastoral clergy in the sickness. The formation of collegiate\r\ninstitutions, whether of the University type or of country colleges\r\nfor secular priests, such as Stoke-Clare, Arundel, and the very many\r\nothers which arose in the century and a half from 1350 to 1500, is\r\nexplained by the very circumstances of the case; and there is no\r\nneed to have recourse to a supposition as to the wane in popularity\r\nof the religious orders, and the prevalent sense that their work was\r\nover, to explain the diminution in their numbers, and the absence\r\nof new monastic foundations. If the relative proportion between the\r\nnumbers of secular and regular clergy ordained before and after the\r\nmiddle of the fourteenth century be taken as a test of the truth of\r\nthis supposition, the statistics available do not bear it out. Thus\r\nthe ordinations to the priesthood, registered in the registers of the\r\ndiocese of Bath and Wells, for the 80 years, 1443 to 1523, number\r\n901; of these 679 were those of seculars and 222 those of regulars.\r\nIn this instance, consequently, the ordination of seculars to\r\nregulars was [p213] in the proportion of 8·5 to 2·7, or rather more\r\nthan three to one.[393]\r\n\r\nIn common with those in worldly professions and businesses the\r\nsurvivors among the clergy appear to have demanded larger stipends\r\nthan they had previously obtained for the performance of their\r\necclesiastical duties. Looking back upon the times, and considering\r\nhow even the small dues of the clergy had been reduced by the death\r\nof a large proportion of their people, till they became wholly\r\ninadequate for their support, it is impossible to blame them harshly,\r\nand not to see that such a demand must inevitably follow upon a great\r\nreduction in numbers. At the time, however, by the direction of\r\nKing and Parliament, the Archbishops and Bishops sought to restrain\r\nthem from making these claims, in the same way as the King tried to\r\nprevent the labourers from demanding higher wages. In his letter to\r\nthe Bishops of his province Archbishop Islip refers \"to the unbridled\r\ncupidity of the human race,\" which ever requires to be checked by\r\njustice, unless \"charity is to be driven out of the world.\" \"General\r\ncomplaints have come to me,\" he writes, \"and experience, the best\r\nteacher of all things, has shown to me that the priests who still\r\nsurvive, not considering that they are preserved by the Divine will\r\nfrom the dangers of the late pestilence, not for their own sakes, but\r\nto perform the ministry committed to them for the people of God, and\r\nthe public utility,\" like other workmen, through cupidity, neglect\r\nthe burdens of curates, and take more profitable offices, for which\r\nalso [p214] they demand more than before. If this be not at once\r\nput a stop to \"many, and indeed most of the churches, prebends, and\r\nchapels of our and your diocese, and indeed of our whole Province,\r\nwill remain absolutely without priests.\" To remedy this not only\r\nwere people urged not to employ such chaplains, but the clergy were\r\nto be compelled under ecclesiastical censures to serve the ordinary\r\ncures at moderate and usual salaries. It seems not improbable that\r\nthis measure may have contributed to draw the sympathies of the\r\nclergy at large more closely to the people in their struggle for\r\nfreedom at this period of English history, when both in the civil and\r\necclesiastical sphere there was the same attempt by public law to\r\nimpose restraints on natural liberty.\r\n\r\nTo the great dearth of clergy at this time may, partly at least,\r\nbe ascribed the great growth of the crying abuse of pluralities.\r\nWithout taking into account the difficulty experienced on all hands\r\nin finding fit, proper, and tried ecclesiastics to fill posts of\r\neminence and responsibility in the Church, it is impossible to\r\naccount for the great increase in the practice just at this time.\r\nThe number of benefices, for example, held by William of Wykeham\r\nhimself, who entered the Church in consequence of the great mortality\r\namong the clergy in 1361, may be explained, if not excused, by the\r\nprevalent and in the circumstances inevitable dearth of subjects\r\nof training and capacity equal to the arduous and delicate duties\r\ndevolving on the higher clergy.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all the great difficulties which beset the Church\r\nin England in consequence of the great mortality, there is abundant\r\nevidence (which is no part of the present subject) of untiring\r\nefforts on the part of the leading ecclesiastics to bring back\r\nobservance to its normal level. This is evidenced in the institution\r\nof so many pious confraternities and guilds, and in a profuse\r\nliberality to churches and sacred places.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of the mortality, so far as the monastic\r\nestablishments of the country are concerned, have already [p215] in\r\nthe course of the narrative frequently been pointed out. The same\r\nreasons which militated against the recruiting for the ranks of the\r\nclergy generally after the plague are sufficient explanation of the\r\nfact that the religious houses were never able to regain the ground\r\nlost in that fatal year. Over and above this, moreover, the sudden\r\nchange in the tenure of land, brought about chiefly by the deaths of\r\nthe monastic tenants, so impaired their financial position, at any\r\nrate for a long period, that they were unable to support the burden\r\nof additional subjects.\r\n\r\nTo the facts showing how the monasteries were depopulated by the\r\ndisease already given may be added the following:—In 1235 the abbey\r\nof St. Albans is supposed to have counted some 100 monks within its\r\nwalls. In the plague of 1349 the abbot and some 47 of his monks died\r\nat one time, and subsequently one more died whilst at Canterbury, on\r\nhis way with the newly-elected abbot to the Roman Curia. Assuming,\r\ntherefore, that the community had remained the same in number as in\r\n1235, St. Albans was at most left with only 51 members. At the close\r\nof the century, namely, in 1396, some 60 monks took part in election,\r\nand as this number includes the priors of the nine dependent cells,\r\nit would seem that the actual community still remained only 51. In\r\n1452 there were only 48 professed monks in the abbey, and at the\r\ndissolution of the monastery, nearly a century later, the number was\r\nreduced to 39. This instance of the way in which the numbers in the\r\nmonastic houses were diminished by the sickness, and by its effect on\r\nthe general population of the country were prevented from ever again\r\nincreasing to their former proportions, may be strengthened by the\r\ncase of Glastonbury. This great abbey of the west of England has ever\r\nbeen regarded as in many respects the most important of the English\r\nBenedictine houses. It is not too much to suppose that in the period\r\nof its greatest prosperity it must have counted probably a hundred\r\nmembers. In 1377 the number, as given on the subsidy-roll, is only\r\n45. In 1456 they stand [p216] at 48, and were about the same at\r\nthe time of the dissolution of the abbey. A similar effect upon the\r\nmembers at Bath has already been pointed out.\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be said that the scourge must have been most\r\ndemoralising to discipline, destructive to traditional practice, and\r\nfatal to observance. It is a well-ascertained fact, strange though\r\nit may seem, that men are not as a rule made better by great and\r\nuniversal visitations of Divine Providence. It has been noticed that\r\nthis is the evident result of all such scourges, or, as Procopius\r\nputs it, speaking of the great plague in the reign of the Emperor\r\nJustinian, \"whether by chance or Providential design it strictly\r\nspared the most wicked.\"[394] So in this visitation, from Italy to\r\nEngland, the universal testimony of those who lived through it is\r\nthat it seemed to rouse up the worst passions of the human heart, and\r\nto dull the spiritual senses of the soul. Wadding, the Franciscan\r\nannalist, has attributed to this very plague of 1348-9 the decay of\r\nfervour evident throughout his own order at this time. \"This evil,\"\r\nhe writes, \"wrought great destruction to the holy houses of religion,\r\ncarrying off the masters of regular discipline and the seniors of\r\nexperience. From this time the monastic orders, and in particular the\r\nmendicants, began to grow tepid and negligent, both in that piety and\r\nthat learning in which they had up to this time flourished. Then,\r\nour illustrious members being carried off, the rigours of discipline\r\nrelaxed by these calamities, could not be renewed by the youths\r\nreceived without the necessary training, rather to fill the empty\r\nhouses than to restore the lost discipline.\"[395]\r\n\r\nWe may sum up the results of the great mortality in the words of\r\na recent writer. \"For our purpose,\" writes Dr. Cunningham, \"it is\r\nimportant to notice that the steady progress of the twelfth and\r\nthirteenth centuries was [p217] suddenly checked in the fourteenth;\r\nthe strain of the hundred years' war would have been exhausting in\r\nany case, but the nation had to bear it when the Black Death had\r\nswept off half the population and the whole social structure was\r\ndisorganised.\"[396]\r\n\r\nIn dealing with this subject it is difficult to bring home to the\r\nmind the vast range of the great calamity, and to duly appreciate\r\nhow deep was the break with then existing institutions. The plague\r\nof 1349 simply shattered them; and it is, as already pointed out,\r\nonly by perpetual reiteration and reconsideration of the same\r\nphenomena that we can bring ourselves to understand the character\r\nof such a social and religious catastrophe. But it is at the same\r\ntime of the first importance thoroughly to realise the case if we\r\nare to enter into and to understand the great process of social\r\nand religious re-edification, to which the immediately succeeding\r\ngenerations had to address themselves. The tragedy was too grave to\r\nallow of people being carried over it by mere enthusiasm. Indeed,\r\nthe empiric and enthusiast in the attempts at social reconstruction,\r\nas may be found in the works of Wycliff, could only aggravate the\r\nevil. It was essentially a crisis that had to be met by strenuous\r\neffort and unflagging work in every department of human activity.\r\nAnd here is manifested a characteristic of the middle ages which\r\nconstitutes, as the late Professor Freeman has pointed out, their\r\nreal greatness. In contradistinction to a day like our own, which\r\nabounds in every facility for achievement, they had to contend with\r\nevery material difficulty; but in contradistinction, too, to that\r\npractical pessimism which has to-day gained only too great a hold\r\nupon intelligences otherwise vivacious and open, difficulties, in\r\nthe middle ages, called into existence only a more strenuous and\r\nmore determined resolve to meet and surmount them. And here is the\r\nsense in which the hackneyed, and in a sense untrue, phrase, \"the\r\nAges [p218] of Faith,\" has a real application, for nothing can be\r\nmore contrary to the spirit and tone of mind of the whole epoch than\r\npessimism, nothing more in harmony with it than hope. In this sense\r\nthe observation of a well-known modern writer on art, in noting the\r\ninability of the middle ages to see things as they really are and the\r\ntendency to substitute on the parchment or the canvas conventional\r\nfor actual forms, has a drift which, perhaps, he did not perceive.\r\nIn itself unquestionably this defect is a real one, but in practice\r\nit possessed a counterbalancing advantage by supplying the necessary\r\ncorrective to that bare literalism and realism which, in the long\r\nrun, is fatal no less to sustained effort than it is to art.\r\n\r\nThe great mortality, commonly called the Black Death, was a\r\ncatastrophe sudden and overwhelming, the like of which it will be\r\ndifficult to parallel. Many a noble aspiration which, could it have\r\nbeen realised, and many a wise conception which, could it have\r\nattained its true development, would have been most fruitful of good\r\nto humanity, was stricken beyond recovery. Still no time was wasted\r\nin vain laments. What had perished was perished. Time, however, and\r\nthe power of effort and work belonged to those that survived.\r\n\r\nTwo of the noblest churches in Italy typify the twofold aspect of\r\nthis great visitation—the Cathedral of Siena and the Cathedral of\r\nMilan. The former, the vast building that crowns the Tuscan Hill, is\r\nbut a fragment of what was originally conceived. It was actually in\r\ncourse of erection, and would have been hardly less in size than the\r\npresent St. Peter's had it been completed. The transepts were already\r\nraised, and the foundations of the enormous nave and choir had been\r\nlaid when the plague fell upon the city. The works were necessarily\r\nsuspended, and from that day to this have never been resumed.\r\n\r\nLittle more than a generation had passed from the fatal year when\r\nthe most glorious Gothic edifice on Italian soil was already rising\r\nfrom the plain of Lombardy—a symbol [p219] of new life, new hopes,\r\nnew greatness, which would surpass the greatness of the buried past.\r\nAnd this, be it observed, was no creation of Prince or Potentate; it\r\nwas essentially the idea, the work, the achievement of the people of\r\nMilan themselves.[397]\r\n\r\nWhat gives, perhaps, the predominant interest to the century and a\r\nhalf which succeeded the overwhelming catastrophe of the Black Death\r\nis the fact of the wonderful social and religious recovery from a\r\nstate almost of dissolution. It is not the place here even to enter\r\nupon so interesting and important a subject. It must suffice to have\r\nindicated the point of view from which the history of the immediately\r\nsucceeding generations must be regarded. In spite of wars and civil\r\ncommotions it was an age of distinct progress, although the very\r\ncomplexity and variety of current and undercurrent is apt at times to\r\ndaze the too impatient inquirer, who wishes to reduce everything to\r\nthe simple result of the definitely good, or the definitely bad.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[366] _Cf._ T.

In the diocese of London, as\r\nalready stated (p. 175 _ante_), the proportion of non-beneficed to\r\nbeneficed clergy ordained during 12 years, from 1362 to 1374, was\r\nnearly six to one.\r\n\r\n[379] Pope, _Essay on Man_, lines 107-8.\r\n\r\n[380] Mr. Thorold Rogers' supposition that the population in 1348 was\r\nonly about 2,500,000 would, on the assumption that the two sexes were\r\nabout equal in number, lead to the conclusion that one man in every\r\n25 was a priest; a suggestion which seems to bear, on the face of it,\r\nits own refutation.\r\n\r\n[381] Amyot (_Archæologia_, xx, p. 531) notes that even soldiers\r\nappear to have been better paid than the clergy. A foot soldier had\r\n3d. a day, or 7 marks a year; a horse soldier 10d. or 12d. a day.\r\nChaucer's good parson, who was only \"rich of holy thought and werk,\"\r\nmight not be remarkable.\r\n\r\n[382] Ed. Twysden, col. 2699.\r\n\r\n[383] Mr. Baigent's MS. extracts from the Episcopal Registers. It\r\nis of interest to note that in normal times very few were ordained\r\nafter their appointment as incumbents. Thus, to take the churches in\r\nthe city of Winchester, besides this period and 1361, when again the\r\nmortality among the clergy was very great, only some 8 or 9 were so\r\nordained between 1349 and 1361, as the following table will show:—\r\n\r\n +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+\r\n | 1346 | 1348 | 1349 | 1350 | 1351 | 1352 | 1354 | 1359 | 1361 |\r\n +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+\r\n |   1  |   1  |  19  |   8  |   4  |   1  |   2  |   1  |   5  |\r\n +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+\r\n\r\n +------+------+\r\n | 1362 | 1363 |\r\n +------+------+\r\n |   1  |   1  |\r\n +------+------+\r\n\r\n\r\n[384] Harl.

Trileck, fol. 180 _seqq._\r\n\r\n[391] Reg. Trileck, fol. 163.\r\n\r\n[392] Archbishop Islip founded Canterbury College at Oxford to supply\r\nthe failing ranks of the clergy and to increase the facilities of\r\nlearning (Wilkins, iii., p. 52), and William of Wykeham likewise\r\nestablished his schools and colleges with the same object.\r\n\r\n[393] In the diocese of London, in the twelve years, from 1362 to\r\n1374, Bishop Sudbury ordained 1,046 seculars and 456 regulars, the\r\nproportion consequently being about 2·3 to 1. In the last twenty\r\nyears of the century, namely, from 1381 to 1401, Bishop Braybroke\r\nordained to the priesthood only 584 seculars, whilst the regulars\r\nwere 425 during the same period. In other words, during the first\r\nperiod, the average annual number of ordinations to the ranks of\r\nthe secular clergy in the diocese of London was over 87; during the\r\nlast twenty years of the century it was only 29·2. The averages of\r\nthe regulars in the corresponding periods were 35 and 21·2. Similar\r\nresults appear from the York registers.\r\n\r\n[394] Archbp. Islip at this time (1350) says: \"Dum ad memoriam\r\nreducimus admirandam pestilentiam que nuper partes istas subito sic\r\ninvasit, ut nobis multo meliores et digniores subtraxerat.\"\r\n\r\n[395] _Annales Minorum_, viii, p. 22.\r\n\r\n[396] _Growth of English Industry and Commerce_, p. 275.\r\n\r\n[397] The _Annali della fabbrica_, published by the Cathedral\r\nadministration, show in the minutest detail the organisation by which\r\nthe necessary funds were raised, and enable us to see how it was\r\npopular enterprise by which so noble an undertaking was achieved.\r\nWe can now realise the weekly collections made by willing citizens\r\nfrom door to door, the collections in the churches, the monthly sales\r\nof offerings in kind of the most varied nature, jewels, dresses,\r\nlinen, pots and pans, divers articles of dress and domestic use.\r\nEvery one, rich and poor alike, felt impelled to join in some way in\r\nthe work which, as the words of the originators express it, \"_was\r\nbegun by Divine inspiration to the honour of Jesus Christ and His\r\nmost Spotless Mother_.\" _Cf._ an article by Mr. Edmund Bishop on the\r\nsubject in the _Downside Review_, July,

renumbered and moved from the ends of pages to the\r\nends of chapters. Ellipses look like the originals. Original printed\r\npage numbers are shown like these: \"[p-xiii]\", in the front matter,\r\nor \"[p013]\".\r\n\r\nThe page images available to the proofreaders and to the transcriber\r\nwere nearly illegible in a few places, especially in the small print\r\nin some footnotes. The first footnote on page 157 is perhaps the\r\nworst example of this: three different images, presumably from three\r\ndifferent printed copies of the book, failed to clarify whether the\r\ncorrect reading is \"Treasury of Receipt 21a/3\", as rendered herein,\r\nor not.\r\n\r\nPage 9, footnote: \"simoon\" was printed, and is retained, but perhaps\r\n\"simoom\" was meant.\r\n\r\nPage 19: \"northen Italy\" changed to \"northern Italy\".\r\n\r\nPage 35, first footnote: comma inserted between \"Austriacarum\" and\r\n\"Scriptores\".\r\n\r\nPage 40: \"crosssd\" changed to \"crossed\".\r\n\r\nPage 61: \"familes\" changed to \"families\".\r\n\r\nPage 63: \"Pfäffers\" is spelled \"Pfäfers\" in the index.\r\n\r\nPage 65: \"Heiligenkreuz\" is spelled \"Heiligen Kreuz\" in the index.\r\n\r\nPage 80: closing quote added to the sentence that ends thus: \"the\r\nburial-place of its victims\".\r\n\r\nPage 85: \"Doulting\" is retained, although it is spelled \"Doulton\" in\r\nthe index on page 228.\r\n\r\nPage 118, etc.: The words \"Shereborne\" (p 229, 240), \"Sherborne\" (p\r\n118, 163), and \"Shireborne\" (p 185, 240) have all been retained,\r\nalthough two or all three may have the same referent.\r\n\r\nPage 133: in \"brother Philip Dallying, late sacrist of Ely\", changed\r\n\"Dallying\" to \"Dallyng\", to agree with index entry.\r\n\r\nPage 134: \"Robert de Spronston\" is spelled \"Sprouston, Robert de,\r\n134\" in the index.\r\n\r\nPage 143: \"Dodinton\" is spelled \"Dodington\" in the index.\r\n\r\nPage 152: \"Rievaux\" changed to \"Rievaulx\" (abbey).\r\n\r\nPage 177: \"Fitz-Eustace\" is spelled \"FitzEustace\" in the index.\r\n\r\nPages 221-244, Index: there are several entries that apparently\r\nrefer to locations within the front matter, where page numbers were\r\ndesignated by Roman numerals. These references generally seem to be\r\nincorrect. For example, under the heading \"Black Death\" on page 223,\r\nthere are four entries that refer the reader to pages iii or vi, but\r\nthese pages were the title page and the second page of the Table of\r\nContents, respectively. Similarly, under the heading Calais, the\r\nreader is referred to page i, which is the half title page of the\r\nprinted book. These incorrect references have been retained.\r\n\r\nPage 226: changed \"archdeanery\" to \"archdeaconry\", under the index\r\nentry \"Chester\".\r\n\r\nPage 234: in \"Lincoln, county of, Escheators' accounts\", changed\r\n\"Escheators'\" to \"Escheator's\" to agree with page 150.\r\n\r\nPage 235: \"Mallinge abbey\" to \"Malling abbey\" to agree with text on\r\npages 104 and 106.\r\n\r\nPage 237: \"Oxford, St. Frideswithe\" changed to \"Oxford, St.\r\nFrideswide\", to agree with text.\r\n\r\nPage 244: in \"Wivelscombe, the bishop of Bath and Wells at,\", changed\r\nthe name to \"Wiveliscombe\". \"Wyclif\" and \"Wyclifite\" were changed to\r\n\"Wycliff\" and \"Wycliffite\", respectively, to agree with the text.",
