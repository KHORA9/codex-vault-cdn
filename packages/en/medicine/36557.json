Many hours are devoted for days\r\nand years, under careful teachers, and many millions of dollars are spent\r\nannually, in educating the mind and the moral nature. But the body is\r\nallowed to grow up all uneducated; indeed, often such a weak, shaky\r\naffair that it gets easily out of order, especially in middle and later\r\nlife, and its owner is wholly unequal to tasks which would have proved\r\neasy to him, had he given it even a tithe of the education bestowed so\r\ngenerously in other directions. Not a few, to be sure, have the advantage\r\nin youth of years of active out-door life on a farm, and so lay up a\r\nstore of vigor which stands them in good stead throughout a lifetime. But\r\nmany, and especially those born and reared in towns and cities, have had\r\nno such training, or any equivalent, and so never have the developed\r\nlungs and muscles, the strong heart and vigorous digestion--in short, the\r\nimproved tone and strength in all their vital organs--which any sensible\r\nplan of body-culture, followed up daily, would have secured. It does not\r\nmatter so much whether we get vigor on the farm, the deck, the tow-path,\r\nor in the gymnasium, if we only get it. Fortunately, if not gotten in\r\nyouth, when we are plastic and easily shaped, it may still be had, even\r\nfar on in middle life, by judicious and systematic exercise, aimed first\r\nto bring up the weak and unused parts, and then by general work daily\r\nwhich shall maintain the equal development of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe aim here has been, not to write a profound treatise on gymnastics,\r\nand point out how to eventually reach great performance in this art, but\r\nrather in a way so plain and untechnical that even any intelligent boy or\r\ngirl can readily understand it, to first give the reader a nudge to take\r\nbetter care of his body, and so of his health, and then to point out one\r\nway to do it. That there are a hundred other ways is cheerfully conceded.\r\nIf anything said here should stir up some to vigorously take hold of, and\r\nfaithfully follow up, either the plan here indicated or any one of these\r\nothers, it cannot fail to bring them marked benefit, and so to gratify\r\n\r\n                                                        THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n  _New York, July, 1883._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAP.

Look at them\r\ncarefully as they pass, and you will see that scarcely one in ten is either\r\nerect or thoroughly well-built. Some slouch their shoulders and double in\r\nat the waist; some overstep; others cant to one side; this one has one\r\nshoulder higher than the other, and that one both too high; some have heavy\r\nbodies and light legs, others the reverse; and so on, each with his own\r\npeculiarities. A thoroughly erect, well-proportioned man, easy and graceful\r\nin his movements, is far from a frequent sight. Any one accustomed to\r\nathletic work, and knowing what it can do for the body, must at times have\r\nwondered why most men allowed themselves to go along for years, perhaps\r\nthrough life, so carrying themselves as not only to lack the outward grace\r\nand ease they might possess, and which they occasionally see in others, but\r\nso as to directly cramp and impede one or more of the vital organs.\r\n\r\nNor is it always the man's fault that he is ill-proportioned. In most\r\ncases it comes down from his progenitors. The father's walk and physical\r\npeculiarities appear in the son, often so plainly that the former's\r\ncalling might almost be told from a look at the latter.\r\n\r\nA very great majority of Americans are the sons either of farmers or\r\nmerchants, mechanics or laborers. The work of each class soon develops\r\npeculiar characteristics. No one of the four classes has ordinarily had\r\nany training at all aimed to make him equally strong all over. Broad as\r\nis the variety of the farmer's work, far the greater, and certainly the\r\nheavier, part of it tends to make him stoop forward and become inerect.\r\nNo man stands up straight and mows. When he shovels, he bends more yet;\r\nand every ounce of spade or load pulls him over, till, after much of\r\nthis sort of work, it requires an effort to stand upright. Ploughing is\r\nbetter for the upper body, but it does not last long. While it keeps\r\none walking over uneven ground, it soon brings on an awkward, clumsy\r\nstep, raising, as it does, the foot unnaturally high. Chopping is\r\nexcellent for the upper man, but does little for his legs. In\r\nhand-raking and hoeing the man may remain erect; but in pitching and\r\nbuilding the load, in nearly every sort of lifting, and especially the\r\nheavier sorts, as in handling heavy stone or timber, his back is always\r\nbent over. It is so much easier to slouch over when sitting on\r\nhorse-rake, mower, or harvester, that most persons do it.\r\n\r\nScarcely any work on a farm makes one quick of foot. All the long day,\r\nwhile some of the muscles do the work, which tends to develop them, the\r\nrest are untaxed, and remain actually weak. A farmer is seldom a good\r\nwalker, usually hitching up if he has an errand to go, though it be scarce\r\na mile away; and he is rarely a good runner. He is a hearty, well-fed man,\r\nnot only because wholesome food is plenty, but because his appetite is\r\nsharp, and he eats with relish and zest. Naturally a man thinks that, when\r\nhe eats and sleeps well, he is pretty healthy, and so he usually is; but\r\nwhen he is contented with this condition of things, he overlooks the fact\r\nthat he is developing some parts of his body, and leaving others weak;\r\nthat the warp he is encouraging in that body, by twice as much work for\r\nthe muscles of his back as for those of the front of his chest, while it\r\nenlarges the former, often so as to even render it muscle-bound, actually\r\ncontracts the latter, and hence gives less room for heart, lungs, stomach,\r\nand all the vital organs, than a well-built man would have. If a man\r\nshould tie up one arm, and with the other steadily swing a smith's hammer\r\nall day, there is little doubt that he would soon have an excellent\r\nappetite and the sweet sleep of the laboring man. But in what shape would\r\nit leave him in a few years, or even in a few months? The work of the\r\nfarmer, ill-distributed as to the whole man, leaves him as really\r\none-sided as the former. It is in a lesser degree, of course, but still so\r\nevident that he who looks even casually may see it.\r\n\r\nWhile the farmer's work makes a man hearty and well, though lumbering,\r\nit takes the spring out of him. The merchant is, physically, however, in\r\na worse position. Getting to his work in boyhood, sticking to it as long\r\nas the busiest man in the establishment, his body often utterly unfit\r\nand unready for even half the strain it bears, he struggles on through\r\nthe boy's duties, the clerk's, and the salesman's, till he becomes a\r\npartner; or perhaps he starts as entry-clerk, rises to be book-keeper,\r\nand then stays there. In many kinds of work he has been obliged to stand\r\nnearly all day, till his sides and waist could scarcely bear it longer,\r\nand he often breaks down under the ceaseless pressure. If his work calls\r\nhim out much, he finds that the constant walking, with his mind on the\r\nstretch, and more or less worried, does not bring him that vigor he\r\nnaturally looks for from so much exercise, and at night he is jaded and\r\nused up, instead of being fresh and hearty. When exceptional tension\r\ncomes, and business losses or reverses make him anxious and haggard,\r\nthere is little in his daily work which tends to draw him out of a\r\nsituation that he could have readily and easily fitted himself to face,\r\nand weather too, had he only known how. To be sure, when he gets well on\r\nand better to do, he rides out in the late afternoon, and domestic and\r\nsocial recreation in the evening may tend to freshen him, and fit him\r\nfor the next day's round; but, especially if he has been a strong young\r\nman, he finds that he is changed, and cannot work on as he used to do.\r\nHis bodily strength and endurance are gone. The reason why is plain\r\nenough: when he was at his best, he was doing most work, and of the sort\r\nto keep him in good condition. Now there is nothing between rising and\r\nbedtime to build up any such strength, and he is fortunate if he retains\r\neven half of what he had. To be sure, he does not need the strength of a\r\nstalwart young farmer; but, could he have retained it, he would have\r\nbeen surprised, if he had taken sufficient daily exercise to regulate\r\nhimself, how valuable it would have been in toning him up for the\r\nseverer work and trial of the day. If, instead of the taxed and worn-out\r\nnerves, he could have had the feeling of the man of sturdy physique, who\r\nkeeps himself in condition, who does not know what it is to be nervous,\r\nwhat a priceless boon it would have been for him!\r\n\r\nWho does not know among his friends business men whose faces show that\r\nthey are nearly all the time overworked; who get thin, and stay so; who\r\nlook tired, and are so; who go on dragging along through their\r\nduties--for they are men made of the stuff which does the duty as it\r\ncomes up, whether hard or easy? The noon meal is rushed through, perhaps\r\nwhen the brain is at white-heat. More is eaten, both then and in the\r\nevening, than will digest; and good as is the after or the before dinner\r\nride, as far as it goes, it does not go far enough to make the digestion\r\nsure. Then comes broken sleep. The man waking from it is not rested, is\r\nnot rebuilt and strong, and ready for the new day.\r\n\r\nWith many men of this kind--and all city men know they are well-nigh\r\ninnumerable--what wonder is it that nervous exhaustion is so frequent\r\namong them, and that physicians who make this disorder a specialty\r\noften have all that they can do? One of the most noted of them, Dr. S.\r\nWeir Mitchell, of Philadelphia, in his valuable little book, \"Wear and\r\nTear; or, Hints for the Overworked,\" page 46, says:\r\n\r\n\"All classes of men who use the brain severely, and who have also--and\r\nthis is important--seasons of excessive anxiety or grave\r\nresponsibility, are subject to the same form of disease; and this\r\nis why, I presume, that I, as well as others who are accustomed to\r\nencounter nervous disorders, have met with numerous instances of\r\nnervous exhaustion among merchants and manufacturers.\r\n\r\n\"My note-books seem to show that manufacturers and certain classes\r\nof railway officials are the most liable to suffer from neural\r\nexhaustion. Next to these come merchants in general, brokers,\r\netc.; then, less frequently, clergymen; still less often, lawyers;\r\nand, more rarely, doctors; while distressing cases are apt to\r\noccur among the over-schooled young of both sexes.\"\r\n\r\nAnd while the more active among business men run into this sort of\r\ndanger, those less exposed to it still do little or nothing to give\r\nthemselves sound, vigorous bodies, so as to gain consequent energy and\r\nhealth, and so they go through life far less efficient and useful men\r\nthan they might have been. Hence their sons have to suffer. The boy\r\ncertainly cannot inherit from the father more vigor and stamina than\r\nthe latter has, however favored the mother may have been; so, unless the\r\nboy has some sort of training which builds him up, his father's\r\nweaknesses or physical defects are very likely to show in the son.\r\n\r\nNor do most classes of mechanics fare much better. Take the heavier\r\nkinds of skilled labor. The blacksmith rarely uses one of his hands as\r\nmuch as the other, especially in heavy work, and often has poor legs.\r\nIndeed, if he has good legs, he does not get them from his calling. The\r\nstone-mason is equally one-handed--one hand merely guiding a light tool,\r\nthe other swinging a heavy mallet. Nine-tenths of all machinists are\r\nright-handed. And so on, through the long list of the various trades\r\nwhere severe muscular exertion is requisite, there is a similar uneven\r\ndistribution of the work to the various parts of the body, the right arm\r\ngenerally getting the lion's share, the left but little, the back more\r\nthan the chest--or, rather, than the front chest--and the legs having\r\nbut passive sort of work at best. Puddlers and boiler-makers, plumbers\r\nand carpenters, coopers and smiths, shipwrights, carriage-makers,\r\ntinners, and all who follow trades calling for vigorous muscular action,\r\nnot only constantly work one side more than the other, but many of their\r\ntools are made, purposely, right-handed, so that they could hardly use\r\nthem with the left hand if they wanted to. As to those whose work is\r\nmore delicate, saddlers and shoe-makers, mill-hands and compositors,\r\nwood-turners, tailors, jewellers and engravers, and nearly all the\r\nlighter craftsmen, learn their trade with one hand, and would never\r\nventure to trust any of its finer work to the other. In short, take the\r\nmechanic where you will, in the vast majority of instances his right arm\r\nand side are larger and stronger than his left, and quite as often his\r\nvocation does little or nothing to strengthen and develop his legs.\r\n\r\nThe fact that most of these men have active work for some of the muscles,\r\nwith enough of it to insure a good appetite, combined with inherited\r\nvigor, makes them often hearty men, but it leaves them unequally\r\ndeveloped. When they get into the gymnasium, they are usually lacking in\r\nthat symmetry, ease, and erectness which they might all along have had,\r\nhad they but used the means. The result, then, of overworking one part of\r\nthe body at the expense of the other, especially in heavier mechanical\r\nlabors, and of too little vigorous action in the lighter, tends to make\r\nthe average workman more prone to disease. Were there uniform development,\r\nand that daily vigorous exercise which would stimulate the dormant parts\r\nof the man's body, it would add to his life and usefulness.\r\n\r\nBut how is it with the sturdy laborer? He can hardly be liable to the same\r\ndefects. His work certainly must call into play every muscle of his body.\r\n\r\nWell, watch him awhile and see. Try the coal-heaver. His surely is heavy,\r\nhard work, and must make him exert himself all over. But does it? While it\r\nkeeps his knees steadily bent, his back is all the while over his work.\r\nThe tons of coal he lifts daily with his shovel gradually, but with\r\npositive certainty, insures his back remaining somewhat bent when his work\r\nfor the time is done. When a year is spent at such labor, the back must\r\ntake a lasting curve. While his back broadens, growing thick and powerful,\r\nhis chest does not get so much to do; hence he is soon a round-shouldered\r\nman. As he does not hold his chest out, nor his neck and head erect, he\r\ncontracts his lung-room, as well, indeed, as his general vital-room.\r\nScarce any man grows earlier muscle-bound, for few backs do so much hard\r\nwork. Now, standing erect, let him try and slap the backs of his hands\r\ntogether behind his shoulders, keeping his arms horizontal and straight at\r\nthe elbow. Now he will understand what is meant by being muscle-bound. It\r\nwill be odd if he can get his hands within a foot of each other.\r\n\r\nThe navvy is no better. The gardener's helper has to do much stooping.\r\nSo do track-hands, stone-breakers, truckmen, porters, longshoremen,\r\nand all the rest. Especially are ordinary day-laborers, whose tools\r\nare spade, pick, and bar, who are careless about their skin, who\r\nare exposed to dust and dirt, who are coarsely shod, most prone to\r\nhave bad feet. They, too, have the hearty appetite and the sound\r\nsleep. Seldom do they give their bodily improvement a thought, and\r\nso often, like their own teeth, they decay before their time, and\r\nmaterially shorten their usefulness and their days.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we see that the vast majority of men in this\r\ncountry--three out of four at least--are born of fathers but\r\npartially developed, and uniformly of inerect carriage.\r\n\r\nAnd how is it with their mothers? Naturally they come, to a large\r\nextent, from the same classes. They inherit many of the\r\ncharacteristics of their fathers--size, color, temperament, and so on,\r\nand generally the same tendency to be stronger on one side than on the\r\nother. In the poorer classes their life is one of work, frequently of\r\noverwork and drudgery, and in ill-lighted, ill-ventilated apartments.\r\nAmong those better off, they do not work enough, and often,\r\nthough of vigorous parents, are not themselves strong.\r\n\r\nThoroughly healthy, hearty women are not common among us. Ask the family\r\nphysician, and he will endorse this statement to an extent most men would\r\nnot have supposed. American women are not good walkers. Look how they are\r\nastonished when they hear of some lady who walks from five to ten miles a\r\nday, and thinks nothing of it. One such effort would be positively\r\ndangerous to very many, indeed probably to the majority of our women,\r\nwhile nearly all of them would not get over its effects for several days.\r\nYet many English and Canadian ladies take that much exercise daily from\r\nchoice, and, finding the exhilaration, strength, and health it brings,\r\nand the general feeling of efficiency which it produces, would not give\r\nit up. No regular exercise is common among the great majority of the\r\nwomen of this country which makes them use both their hands alike, and is\r\nyet vigorous enough to add to the size and strength of their shoulders,\r\nchests, and arms. Ordinary house-work brings the hands of those who\r\nindulge in it a good deal to do, even though the washing and ironing are\r\nleft to hired help. The care of children adds materially to the exertion\r\ncalled for in a day. But far too often both the house-work and the\r\nlooking after the children are sources of great exertion. Were the\r\nwoman strong and full of vigor, she would turn each off lightly,\r\nand still be fresh and hearty at the end of the day.\r\n\r\nWith the father, as with the mother, the conclusion arrived at seems to be\r\nas follows: now that the day's work is done, no matter whether it brings\r\nwith it strength or weakness, let us be perfectly contented with things as\r\nthey are. If it makes us one-handed, so be it. If it stoops the back over,\r\nso be it. If it does little or nothing for the lower limbs, or cramps the\r\nchest, or never half fills the lungs, or aids digestion not a whit, so be\r\nit. If it keeps some persons thin and tired-looking, and does not prevent\r\nothers from growing too fleshy, it never occurs to most of them that a very\r\nsmall amount of knowledge and effort in the right direction would work\r\nwonders, and in a way which would be not only valuable but attractive.\r\n\r\nMost of us get, then, from our parents a one-sided and partial\r\ndevelopment, and are contented with it. Unless we ourselves take steps to\r\nbetter our condition, unless we single out the weak spots, prescribe the\r\nwork and the amount of it, and then do that work, we shall not remedy the\r\nevil. More than this, if we do not cure these defects, we will not only\r\ngo through life with limited and cramped physical resources, with their\r\naccompanying disorders and ailments, but we will cruelly entail on our\r\nchildren defects and tendencies which might have readily been spared\r\nthem, and for which they can fairly blame us. A little attention to the\r\nsubject will show that the remedy is quite within our reach; and so plain\r\nis this, that a generation later, if the interest now awakening in this\r\ndirection becomes, as it promises to, very general among us, our\r\ndescendants will understand far better than we do that the body can be\r\neducated, as well as the mind or the moral nature; that, instead of\r\ninterfering with the workings of these, the body will, when properly\r\ntrained, directly and materially aid them; and, further, that there is no\r\nstand-point from which the matter can be viewed which will not show that\r\nsuch training will pay, and most handsomely at that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nHALF-BUILT BOYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, whatever our inherited lacks and strong points, few who have looked\r\ninto the matter can have failed to notice that the popular sports and\r\npastimes, both of our boyhood and youth, good as they are, as far as they\r\ngo, are not in themselves vigorous enough, or well enough chosen to remedy\r\nthe lack. The top, the marble, and the jack-knife of the boy are wielded\r\nwith one hand, and for all the strength that wielding brings, it might as\r\nwell have been confined to one. Flying kites is not likely to overdo the\r\nmuscles. Yet top-time, marble-time, and kite-time generally cover all the\r\navailable play hours of each day for a large portion of the year.\r\n\r\nBut he has more vigorous work than these bring. Well, what? Why,\r\nball-playing and playing tag, and foot-ball, and skating, and\r\ncoasting, and some croquet, and occasional archery, while\r\nhe is a painfully accurate shot with a bean-shooter.\r\n\r\nWell, in ball-playing he learns to pitch, to catch, to bat, to field, and\r\nto run bases. How many boys can pitch with either hand? Not one in a\r\nhundred, at least well enough to be of any use in a game. Observe the\r\npitching arm and shoulder of some famous pitcher, and see how much larger\r\nthey are than their mates. Dr. Sargent, for many years instructor in\r\nphysical culture in Yale College, says that he has seen a well-known\r\npitcher whose right shoulder was some two inches larger than the left;\r\nindeed, his whole right side seemed out of proportion with his left. The\r\ncatcher draws both hands in toward him as the ball enters them, and passes\r\nit back to the pitcher almost always with the same hand. He has, in\r\naddition, to spring about on his feet, unless the balls come very\r\nuniformly, and to do much twisting and turning. The batter bats, not from\r\neither shoulder, but from one shoulder, to such an extent that those used\r\nto his batting know pretty well where he will knock the ball, though, did\r\nhe bat from the other shoulder, the general direction of the knocking\r\nwould be quite different. Some of the fielders have considerable running\r\nand some catching to do, and then to throw the ball in to pitcher, or\r\nbaseman, or catcher. But that throw is always with the stronger hand,\r\nnever with the other. Many of the fielders often have not one solitary\r\nthing to do but to walk to their stations, remain there while their side\r\nis out, and then walk back again, hardly getting work enough, in a cold\r\nday, to keep them warm. Running bases is sharp, jerky work, and a wretched\r\nsubstitute for steady, sensible running over a long distance. Nor is the\r\nfielder's running much better; and neither would ever teach a boy what he\r\nought to know about distributing his strength in running, and how to get\r\nout of it what he readily might, and, more important yet, how to make\r\nhimself an enduring long-distance runner. For all the work the former\r\nbrings, ordinary, and even less than ordinary, strength of leg and lung\r\nwill suffice, but for the latter it needs both good legs and good lungs.\r\n\r\nRun most American boys of twelve or fourteen six or eight miles, or,\r\nrather, start them at it--let them all belong to the ball-nine if you\r\nwill, too--and how many would cover half the distance, even at any pace\r\nworth calling a run? The English are, and have long been, ahead of us in\r\nthis direction. To most readers the above distance seems far too long to\r\nlet any boy of that age run. But, had he been always used to\r\nrunning--not fast, but steady running--it would not seem so. Tom\r\nBrown of Rugby, in the hares-and-hounds game, of which he gives us\r\nso graphic an account, makes both the hares and hounds cover a distance\r\nof nine miles without being much the worse for it, and yet they were\r\nsimply school-boys, of all ages from twelve to eighteen.\r\n\r\nLet him who thinks that the average American boy of the same age would\r\nhave fared as well, go down to the public bath-house, and look\r\ncarefully at a hundred or two of them as they tumble about in the\r\nwater. He will see more big heads and slim necks, more poor legs and\r\nskinny arms, and lanky, half-built bodies than he would have ever\r\nimagined the whole neighborhood could produce. Or he need not see\r\nthem stripped. One of our leading metropolitan journals, in an\r\neditorial recently, headed, \"Give the boy a chance,\" said:\r\n\r\n\"About one in ten of all the boys in the Union are living in New York and\r\nthe large cities immediately adjacent; and there are even more within the\r\nlimits of Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, and the other American cities\r\nwhose population exceeds a hundred thousand. The wits of these millions of\r\nboys are being forced to their extreme capacity, whether they are taught\r\nin the school, the shop, or the street. But what is being done for their\r\nbodies? The answer may be obtained by standing at the door of almost any\r\npublic or private school or academy at the hour of dismissal. _The\r\ninquirer will see a crowd of undersized, listless, thin-faced children,\r\nwith scarcely any promise of manhood about them._\"\r\n\r\nTake a tape-measure and get the girth of chest, upper and forearm, of\r\nwaist, hips, thighs, and calves of these little fellows, likewise their\r\nheights and ages. Now send to England and get the statistics of the boys\r\nof the same age who are good at hares-and-hounds, at foot-ball, and see\r\nthe difference. In every solitary measurement, save height, there is\r\nlittle doubt which would show the better figures. Even in height, it\r\nis more than probable that the article just quoted would find\r\nabundant foundation for calling our boys \"undersized.\"\r\n\r\nNext cross to Germany, and go to the schools where boys and their\r\nmasters together, in vacation days, sometimes walk two or even three\r\nhundred miles, in that land where the far-famed German Turners, by long\r\ntraining, show a strength and agility combined which are astounding,\r\nand try the tape-measure there. Is there any question what the result\r\nwould be? When the sweeping work the Germans made of it in their late\r\nwar with France is called to mind, does it not look as if there was\r\ngood ground for the assumption so freely made, that it was the\r\nsuperior physique of the Germans which did the business?\r\n\r\nWhere work is chosen that only sturdy limbs can do, and that work\r\nis gradually approached, and persistently stuck to, by-and-by the\r\nsturdy limbs come. But when all that these limbs are called on\r\nto do is light, spasmodic work, and there is none of the spur\r\nwhich youthful emulation and pride in superior strength bring,\r\nwhat wonder is it if the result is a weakly article?\r\n\r\nAnother and natural consequence many parents must have noticed. Often, in a\r\ncity neighborhood, there is not one strong, efficient boy to lead on the\r\nrest, and show them the development which they might have and should have.\r\nBoys, like men, are fond of doing whatever they can do well, and of letting\r\nothers see them do it, and, like their elders, they gladly follow a capable\r\nand self-reliant leader. But if no one of their number is equal to tasks\r\nwhich call for first-class strength and staying powers, when no one will\r\nlead the rest up to a higher physical plane, they never will get there.\r\n\r\nIt is not a good sign, or one that bodes well for our future, to see the\r\nplay-grounds of our cities and towns so much neglected. You may stand on\r\nmany of them for weeks together and not see one sharp, hot game of ball,\r\nor of anything else, where each contestant goes in with might and main,\r\nand the spectator becomes so interested as to hate to leave the fun.\r\nFoot-ball is a game as yet not at all general among us. Excellent is it\r\nfor developing intrepidity and other manly qualities. The Duke of\r\nWellington is reported to have said that her foot-ball fields were where\r\nEngland's soldiers were made. The short, hasty school recess in the\r\ncrowded school-yard, or play snatched in the streets--these will never\r\nmake robust and vigorous men. Yet these are too often all that our boys\r\nget, their cramped facilities for amusement soon bringing their natural\r\nresult in small vital organs and half-developed limbs.\r\n\r\nMany of our large cities are wretchedly off for play-grounds. Such open\r\nspaces as we have are fenced around, and have signs nailed all over them\r\nsaying, \"Keep off the grass!\" at the same time forbidding games on the\r\npaths. One part of Boston Common used to be a famous play-ground; and many\r\nhard-fought battles has it seen at foot-ball, base-ball, hockey, and\r\ncricket. Many an active school-boy there has more than once temporarily\r\nbit the dust. But now rows of street lamps run through that part of the\r\nCommon, and the precious grass must be protected at all hazards. New York\r\ncity is scarcely better off. Central Park, miles away from the great\r\nmajority of the boys in the city, is elegant enough when they get to it;\r\nbut let them once set their bounds and start a game of ball, or\r\nhares-and-hounds, or try a little jumping or running, on any one of those\r\nhundreds of beautiful acres, save in one solitary field, and see how soon\r\nthe gray-coats will be upon them. The Battery, City Hall Park, Washington\r\nSquare, Union Park, Stuyvesant Square, and Madison Square are well\r\nlocated, and would make capital play-grounds, but the grass there is\r\naltogether too well combed to be ruffled by unruly boys. If a boy's cousin\r\ncomes in from the country, and he wishes to try conclusions with him, he\r\nmust confine his efforts to the flagged sidewalk or the cobble-stoned\r\nstreet, while a brass-buttoned referee is likely at any moment to\r\ninterfere, and take them both into custody for disorderly conduct.\r\n\r\nAgain, outside of a boy's ball-playing, scarce one of his other\r\npastimes does much to build him up. Swimming is excellent, but is\r\nconfined to a very few months in the year, and is seldom gone at, as it\r\nshould be, with any regularity, or with a competent teacher to\r\ngradually lead the boy on to its higher possibilities. Skating is\r\nequally desultory, because in many of our cities winters pass with\r\nscarcely a week of good ice. Coasting brings some up-hill walking, good\r\nfor the legs, but does practically nothing for the arms.\r\n\r\nSo boyhood slips along until the lad is well on in his teens, and still,\r\nin nine cases out of ten, he has had nothing yet of any account in the\r\nway of that systematic, vigorous, daily exercise which looks directly to\r\nhis weak points, and aims not only to eradicate them, but to build up\r\nhis general health and strength as well. He gets no help in the one\r\nplace of all where he might so easily get it--the school. So far as we\r\ncan learn, no system of exercise has been introduced into any school or\r\ncollege in this land, unless it is at the military academy at West\r\nPoint, which begins to do for each pupil, not alone what might easily be\r\ndone, but what actually _ought_ to be done. It will probably not be many\r\nyears before all of us will wonder why the proper steps in this\r\ndirection have been put off so long. Calisthenics are here and there\r\nresorted to. In some schools a rubber strap has been introduced, the\r\npupil taking one end of it in each hand, and working it in a few\r\ndifferent directions, but in a mild sort of way. At Amherst College\r\nenough has been accomplished to tell favorably on the present health of\r\nthe student, but not nearly enough to make him strong and vigorous all\r\nover, so as to build him up against ill health in the future. At another\r\ncollege certain exercises, excellent in their way, admirable for\r\nsuppling the joints and improving the carriage, have for some time been\r\npractised. But this physical work does not go nearly far enough, nor is\r\nit aimed sufficiently at each pupil's peculiar weak spot. It also\r\nneither reaches all the students, nor is it practised but a small part\r\nof the year. In the great majority of our schools and colleges, little\r\nor no idea is given the pupil as to the good results he will derive from\r\nexercise. The teacher's own experience in physical development is\r\noften more limited than that of some of his scholars.\r\n\r\nThe evil does not end here. Take the son of the man of means and\r\nrefinement, a boy who is having given him as liberal an education as\r\nmoney can buy and his parents' best judgment can select, one who spends\r\na third or more of his life in fitting himself to get on successfully in\r\nthe remainder of it. That boy certainly ought to come out ready for his\r\nlife's work, with not only a thoroughly-trained mind and a strong moral\r\nnature, but with a well-developed, vigorous physique, and a knowledge of\r\nhow to maintain it, so that he may make the most of all his advantages.\r\n\r\nBut how often does this happen? Stand by the gate as the senior class of\r\nalmost any college in this country files out from its last examination\r\nbefore graduation, and look the men carefully over. Ask your physician to\r\njoin you in the scrutiny. If, between you two, you can arrive at the\r\nconclusion that one-half, or even one-third of them, have that vitality and\r\nstamina which make it probable that they will live till seventy, it will be\r\nindeed most surprising. A few of these young men, the athletes, will be\r\nwell-developed, better really than they need be. But this over-development\r\nmay be far from the safest or wisest course. Even though physically\r\nimproved by it, it is not certain that this marked development will carry\r\nthem onward through life to a ripe old age. But, with others indifferently\r\ndeveloped, there will be many more positively weak. Such men may have\r\nbright, uncommon heads. Yes; but a bright and uncommon head on a broken\r\ndown, or nearly broken down, body is not going to make half as effective a\r\nman in the life-race as a little duller head and a good deal better body.\r\n\r\nBut have these graduates had a competent instructor at college to look\r\nafter them in this respect? Will some one name a college where they have\r\nsuch an instructor? or a school where, instead of building the pupil up\r\nfor the future, more has been done than to insure his present health?\r\nOne or two such there may be, but scarcely more than one or two.\r\n\r\nTake even the student who has devoted the most time to severe muscular\r\nexercise--the rowing-man, not the beginner, but the veteran of a score\r\nor more of races, who has been rowing all his four college years as\r\nregularly and almost as often as he dined. Certainly it will not be\r\nclaimed that his is not a well-developed body, or that his permanent\r\nhealth is not insured. Let us look a little at him and see. What has he\r\ndone? He entered college at eighteen, and is the son, say, of a\r\njournalist or of a professional man. Finding, when he came to be\r\nfourteen or fifteen, that he was not strong, that somehow he did not\r\nfill out his clothes, he put in daily an hour or more at the gymnasium,\r\nwalked much at intervals, took sparring lessons, did some rowing, and\r\nperhaps, by the time he entered college, got his upper arm to be a foot\r\nor even thirteen inches in circumference, with considerable muscle on\r\nhis chest. Now this young man hears daily, almost hourly, of the\r\nwonderful Freshman crew--an embryotic affair as yet, to be sure, but of\r\nexalted expectations--and into that crew he must go at all hazards. He\r\nis tried and accepted. Now, for four years, if a faithful oar, he will\r\nrow all of a thousand miles a year. As each year has, off and on, not\r\nover two hundred rowing-days in all, he will generally, for the greater\r\npart of the remaining time, pull nearly an equivalent daily at the\r\nrowing-weights. He will find a lot of eager fellows at his side, working\r\ntheir utmost to outdo him, and get that place in the boat which he so\r\nearnestly covets, and which he is not yet quite sure that he can hold.\r\nSome of his muscles are developing fast. His recitations are, perhaps,\r\nsuffering a little, but never mind that just now, when he thinks that\r\nthere is more important work on hand. The young fellow's appetite is\r\nravenous. He never felt so hearty in his life, and is often told how\r\nwell he is looking. He attracts attention because likely to be a\r\nrepresentative man. He never filled out his clothes as he does now. His\r\nlegs are improving noticeably. They ought to do so, for it is not one or\r\ntwo miles, but three or four, which he runs on almost every one of\r\nthose days in the hundred in which he is not rowing.\r\n\r\nOur young athlete has not always gone into the work from mere choice. For\r\ninstance, one of a recent Harvard Freshman crew told the writer that he had\r\nbroken down his eyes from over-use of them, and, looking about for some\r\nvigorous physical exercise which would tone him up quickly and restore his\r\neyesight, and having no one to consult, he had taken to rowing.\r\n\r\nThe years roll by till the whole four are over, and our student is about\r\nto graduate. He looks back to see what he has accomplished. In physical\r\nmatters he finds that, while he is a skilful, and perhaps a decidedly\r\nsuccessful, oar, and that some of his measurements have much improved\r\nsince the day he was first measured, others somehow have not come up\r\nnearly as fast, in fact, have held back in the most surprising way. His\r\nchest-girth may be three or even four inches larger for the four years'\r\nwork. Some, if not much, of that is certainly the result of growth, not\r\ndevelopment, and, save what running did, the rest is rather an increase\r\nof the back muscles than of front and back alike. Strong as his back\r\nis--for many a hard test has it stood in the long, hot home-minutes of\r\nmore than one well-fought race--still he has not yet a thoroughly\r\ndeveloped and capacious chest. Doubtless his legs have improved, if he\r\nhas done any running. (In some colleges the rowing-men scarcely run at\r\nall.) His calves have come to be well-developed and shapely, and so too\r\nhave his thighs, while his loins are noticeably strong-looking and well\r\nmuscled up, and so indeed is his whole back. But if he has done\r\npractically no other arm-work than that which rowing and the preparation\r\nfor it called for, his arms are not so large, especially above the\r\nelbow, as they ought to be for a man with such legs and such a back. The\r\nfront of his chest is not nearly so well developed as his back, perhaps\r\nis hardly developed at all, and he is very likely to carry himself\r\ninerectly, with head and neck canted somewhat forward, while there is a\r\nlack of fulness, often a noticeable hollowness, of the upper chest, till\r\nthe shoulders are plainly warped and rounded forward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. A warped University Oarsman,\r\nimperfectly developed in Muscles not used in Rowing.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. A warped Professional Sculler,\r\nimperfectly developed in Muscles not used in Rowing.]\r\n\r\nWith professional oarsmen, who for years have rowed far more than they\r\nhave done anything else, and who have no especial care for their looks,\r\nor spur to develop harmoniously, the defects rowing leaves stand out\r\nmost glaringly. Notice in the cuts on pp. 36, 37 (Figs. 1 and 2) the\r\nflat and slab-sided, almost hollow, look about the upper chest and front\r\nshoulder, and compare these with the full and well-rounded make of the\r\nfigure whose body is sketched on the cover. It will not take long to\r\ndetermine which has the better front chest, or which is likely to so\r\ncarry that chest as to ward off tendencies to throat and lung troubles.\r\nYet Fig. 1 is from a photograph of one of the most distinguished\r\nstudent-oarsmen America ever produced, while Fig. 2 represents one of\r\nthe swiftest and most skilful professional scullers of the country\r\nto-day.[A] Better proof could not be presented of the effect of a\r\ngreat amount of rowing, and of the very limited exercise it brings\r\nto those muscles which are not especially called on.\r\n\r\nAfter the student's rowing is over, and his college days are past, and\r\nhe settles down to work with not nearly so much play in it, how does he\r\nfind that his rowing pays? Has it made him fitter than his fellows, who\r\nwent into athletics with no such zeal and devotion, to stand life's\r\nwear and tear, especially when that life is to be spent mainly\r\nin-doors? When, in later years, with new associations, business cares,\r\nand long, hard head-work, accompanied, as the latter usually is, by\r\nonly partial inflation of the lungs, when all these get him out of the\r\nway of using his large back muscles, he will find their very size, and\r\nthe long spell of warping forward which so much rowing gave the\r\nshoulders, tends more to weigh him forward than if he had never so\r\ndeveloped them. Instead of benefiting his throat and lungs, this\r\nabnormal development actually inclines to cramp them.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is the case of a man who voluntarily gave much time,\r\nthought, and labor to the severest test of his strength, and who had\r\nhoped to bring about staying powers, and he comes out of it all, to\r\nbegin his real race in life, often no better fitted, perhaps not nearly\r\nso well fitted, for it as some of his comrades who did not spare half so\r\nmuch time to athletics. The other men, who did not work nearly as much\r\nas he did, still managed to hit upon a sort which, instead of cramping\r\ntheir chests, expanded them, enlarging the lung-room, and so gave the\r\nheart, stomach, and other vital organs all the freest play.\r\n\r\nIf the ordinary play and exercise of the boy do not build and round\r\nhim into a sound, well-made, and evenly-balanced man; if the hardest\r\nwork he has hit on, when left to himself to find out, mostly to\r\nbe paid for by a considerable amount of money; if these only leave\r\nhim a half-developed man, can it not be seen at once that an\r\nimprovement is wanted in his physical education?\r\n\r\nAre we not behindhand, and far behindhand, then, in a matter of serious\r\nimportance to the well-being of the people of our country? Do we not want\r\nsome system of education which shall rear men, not morally and\r\nintellectually good alone, but good physically as well? which shall\r\nqualify them both to seize and to make the most of the advantages which\r\nyears of toil and struggle bring, but which advantages among us now are\r\ntoo frequently thrown away. Men too often, just as they are about\r\nclutching these benefits, find, Tantalus-like, that they are eluding their\r\ngrasp. The reason must be plain to all. It is because that grasp is\r\nweakening, and falls powerless at the very time when it could be\r\nand should be surest, and potent for the most good.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] The faces of both men have, of course, been disguised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nWILL DAILY PHYSICAL EXERCISE FOR GIRLS PAY?\r\n\r\n\r\nObserve the girls in any of our cities or towns, as they pass to or from\r\nschool, and see how few of them are at once blooming, shapely, and strong.\r\nSome are one or the other, but very few are all combined, while a decided\r\nmajority are neither one of them. Instead of high chests, plump arms;\r\ncomely figures, and a graceful and handsome mien, you constantly see flat\r\nchests, angular shoulders, often round and warped forward, with scrawny\r\nnecks, pipe-stem arms, narrow backs, and a weak walk. Not one girl in a\r\ndozen is thoroughly erect, whether walking, standing, or sitting. Nearly\r\nevery head is pitched somewhat forward. The arms are frequently held\r\nalmost motionless, and there is a general lack of spring and elasticity in\r\ntheir movements. Fresh, blooming complexions are so rare as to attract\r\nattention. Among eyes, plenty of them pretty, sparkling, or intelligent,\r\nbut few have vigor and force. If any dozen girls, taken at random, should\r\nplace their hands side by side on a table, many, if not most, of these\r\nhands would be found to lack beauty and symmetry, the fingers, and indeed\r\nthe whole hand, too often having a weak, undeveloped, nerveless look.\r\n\r\nNow watch these girls at play. See how few of their games bring them\r\nreally vigorous exercise. Set them to running, and hardly one in the\r\nparty has the swift, graceful, gliding motion she might so readily\r\nacquire. Not one can run any respectable distance at a good pace. There\r\nis abundant vivacity and spirit, abundant willingness to play with great\r\nfreedom, but very little such play as there might be, and which would\r\npay so well. Most of their exercise worth calling vigorous is for their\r\nfeet alone, the hands seldom having much to do. The girls of the most\r\nfavored classes are generally the poorest players. The quality and color\r\nof their clothing necessitates their avoiding all active, hearty play,\r\nwhile it is the constant effort of nurse or governess to repress that\r\nsuperabundance of spirits which ought to belong to every boy and girl.\r\nHolding one's elbows close to the body while walking, and keeping the\r\nhands nearly or quite motionless, may accord with the requirements of\r\nfashionable life, but it's terribly bad for the arms, keeping them poor,\r\nindifferent specimens, when they might be models of grace and beauty.\r\n\r\nAs the girl comes home from school, not with one book only, but often six\r\nor eight, instead of looking light and strong and free, she is too often\r\nwhat she really appears to be, pale and weak. So many books suggest a\r\nlarge amount of work for one day, certainly for one evening, and the\r\nimpression received is that she is overworked, while the truth frequently\r\nis that the advance to be made in each book is but trifling, and the\r\naggregate, not at all large, by no means too great for the same girl were\r\nshe strong and hearty. It is not the mental work which is breaking her\r\ndown, but there is no adequate physical exercise to build her up. See what\r\nex-Surgeon-General Hammond says, in his work on \"Sleep\", as to the ability\r\nto endure protracted brain-work without ill result:\r\n\r\n\"It is not the mere quantity of brain-work which is the chief factor\r\nin the production of disease. The emotional conditions under which\r\nwork is performed is a far more important matter. A man of trained\r\nmental habits can bear with safety an almost incredible amount of\r\nbrain-toil, provided he is permitted to work without distraction or\r\nexcitement, in the absence of disquieting cares and anxieties. It is\r\nnot brain-work, in fact, that kills, but brain-_worry_.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl, of course, has not the strength for the protracted effort of the\r\nmatured man, nor is such effort often required of her. Her studying is\r\ndone quietly at home, undisturbed, usually, by any such cares and\r\nresponsibilities as the man encounters. Hers is generally brain-work, not\r\nbrain-worry. Yet the few hours a day exhaust her, because her vital\r\nsystem, which supports her brain, is feeble and inefficient. No girl is at\r\nschool over six hours out of the twenty-four, and, deducting the time\r\ntaken for recitation, recess, and the various other things which are not\r\nstudy, five hours, or even less, will cover the time she gives to actual\r\nbrain-work in school, with two, or perhaps three, hours daily out of\r\nschool. With the other sixteen hours practically her own, there is ample\r\ntime for all the vigorous physical exercise she needs or could take, and\r\nyet allow ten, or even twelve, of those hours for sleep or eating. But\r\nnotice, in any of these off-hours, what exercise these girls take. They\r\nwalk to and fro from school, they play a few minutes at recess, they may\r\ntake an occasional irregular stroll besides, and may indulge in a game of\r\ncroquet, but all the time intent on their conversation, never thinking of\r\nthe exercise itself, and the benefit it brings. Such things fill up the\r\nmeasure of the daily physical exercise of thousands of our American girls.\r\nIt is the same thing for nearly all, save those from the poorest classes.\r\n\r\nAnd what is the result? Exactly what such exercise--or, rather, such lack\r\nof it--would bring. The short, abrupt run, the walk to or from school,\r\nthe afternoon stroll, or the miscellaneous standing about--none of these\r\ncall for or beget strength of limb, depth of chest, or vitality. None of\r\nthese exercises is more than almost any flat-chested, half-developed girl\r\ncould readily accomplish without serious effort, and, going through them\r\nfor years, she would need little more strength than she had at first.\r\n\r\nBut all this time her mental work comes in no meagre allowance. _It_ is\r\nall the time pushing forward. Subjects are set before her, to grasp and\r\nmaster which requires every day hours of close application for months\r\ntogether. The number of them is also enlarging, and the task is constantly\r\nbecoming more severe. A variety of influences spurs her steadily onward.\r\nMaybe it is emulation and determination which urges her on, not only to do\r\nwell, but to excel. Maybe it is to gratify the teacher's pride, and a\r\ndesire to show the good fruit of her work. Perhaps oftener than anything\r\nelse the girl is in dread of being dropped into another class, and she\r\nresolves to remain with her present one at all hazards.\r\n\r\nBut with all this there is an advance in the amount and difficulty of the\r\nbrain-work. No distinction is made between the delicate girl and the\r\nstrong one. To those of a like age come like tasks. The delicate girl,\r\nfrom her indifference to physical effort, finding that for the time her\r\nweakness of body does not interfere with a ready-working brain, gradually\r\ninclines to draw even more away from livelier games and exercises, in\r\nwhich she does not excel, and to get more at her books. Can there be much\r\ndoubt as to the result a few years later? Is it any wonder that the\r\nneglected body develops some partial weakness, or too often general\r\ndebility? Is it at all a rare thing, in the observation of any one, to\r\nnotice that this weakness, this debility, are very apt to become chronic,\r\nand that the woman, later on in life, is a source of anxiety and a burden\r\nto her friends, when instead of this she might have been a valued helper?\r\n\r\nNow, if the body, during the growing years, was called on to do\r\nnothing which should even half develop it, while the brain was pushed\r\nnearly to its utmost, does it take long to decide whether such a\r\ncourse was a wise one? Leaving out entirely the discomfort to the\r\nbody, is that a sensible system of education which leaves a girl\r\nliable to become weak, if not entirely broken down, before she is well\r\non in middle age? Is this not like giving great care to moral and\r\nmental education alone, and actually doing almost nothing for their\r\nphysical nature? Is this not an irrational and one-sided course, and\r\nsure to beget a one-sided person? And yet is not that just what is\r\ngoing on to-day with a great majority of the young girls in our land?\r\n\r\nThe moment it is conceded that a delicate body can be made a robust one,\r\nthat moment it is equally plain that there can be an almost incalculable\r\ngain in the comfort and usefulness of the possessor of that body, not\r\nonly during all the last half of her life, but through the first half as\r\nwell. And yet, to persons familiar with what judicious, daily physical\r\nexercise has done, and can do, for a delicate body, there is no more\r\ndoubt but that this later strength, and even sturdiness, can be acquired\r\nthan that the algebra or geometry, which at first seems impenetrable,\r\ncan be gradually mastered. The rules which bring success in each are in\r\nmany respects identical. Begin to give the muscles of the hand and\r\nforearm, for instance, as vigorous and assiduous use as these\r\nmathematical studies bring to the brain, and the physical grasp will as\r\nsurely and steadily improve as does the mental. Give not only the\r\ndelicate girls, but all girls, exercises which shall insure strong and\r\nshapely limbs, and chests deep, full, and high, beginning these\r\nexercises mildly, and progressing very gradually, correcting this high\r\nshoulder, or that stoop, or this hollow chest, or that overstep, and\r\ncarrying on this development as long as the school-days last. Let this\r\nbe done under a teacher as familiar with her work as the mathematical\r\ninstructor is with his, and what incalculable benefit would accrue, not\r\nto this generation alone, but to their descendants as well!\r\n\r\nBut will not this physical training dull the mind for its work? If\r\nprotracted several hours, or the greater part of each day, as with the\r\nGerman peasant-woman in the field, or the Scotch fish-woman with her\r\nwares, no doubt it would. But if Maclaren of Oxford wanted but a little\r\nwhile each day to increase the girth of the chests of a dozen British\r\nsoldiers three inches apiece in four months, is this very moderate\r\nallowance likely to work much mental dulness? Did Charles Dickens's\r\nseven to twelve miles afoot daily interfere with some masterly work\r\nwhich his pen produced each day? Did Napoleon's whole days spent in the\r\nsaddle tell very seriously on his mental operations, and prevent him\r\nfrom conceiving and carrying out military and strategic work which will\r\ncompare favorably with any the world's history tells of?\r\n\r\nAnd what if this daily exercise, beside the bodily benefit and improvement\r\nwhich ensues, should also bring actually better mental work? Unbending the\r\nbow for a little while, taking the tension from the brain for a few\r\nminutes, and depleting it by expanding the chest to its fullest capacity,\r\nand increasing the circulation in the limbs--these, instead of impairing\r\nthat brain, will repair it, and markedly improve its tone and vigor.\r\n\r\nThere ought to be in every girls' school in our land, for pupils of\r\nevery age, a system of physical culture which should first eradicate\r\nspecial weaknesses and defects, and then create and maintain the\r\nsymmetry of the pupils, increasing their bodily vigor and strength up to\r\nmaturity. If several, or a majority, of the girls in a class have flat\r\nor indifferent chests, put them in a squad which shall pay direct and\r\nsteady attention to raising, expanding, and strengthening the chest. If\r\nmany have a bad gait, some stepping too long, others too short, set them\r\naside for daily special attention to their step. If many, or nearly all,\r\nhave an inerect carriage, wholly lacking _la ligne_ of Dumas, then daily\r\ninsist on such exercises for them as shall straighten them up and keep\r\nthem up. The dancing-master teaches the girl to step gracefully and\r\naccurately through various dancing-steps. To inculcate a correct length\r\nof step, and method of putting the foot down and raising it in walking,\r\nis not nearly so difficult a task. If the \"setting-up\" drill of the West\r\nPointer in a few weeks transforms the raw and ungainly country boy into\r\na youth of erect and military bearing, and insisting on that bearing at\r\nall times throughout the first year gives the cadet a set and carriage\r\nwhich he often retains through life, is there anything to hinder the\r\ngirl from acquiring an equally erect and handsome carriage of the body\r\nif she too will only use the means? If the muscles which, when fully\r\ndeveloped, enable one to sit or stand erect for hours together are\r\nnow weak, is it not wise to at once strengthen them?\r\n\r\nBut may not this vigorous muscular exercise, which tends to produce hard\r\nand knotted muscles in the man, take away the softer and more graceful\r\nlines, which are essentially feminine? If exercise be kept up for hours\r\ntogether, as in the case of the blacksmith, undoubtedly it would. But that\r\nis a thing a sensible system of exercise would avoid, as studiously as it\r\nwould the weakness and inefficiency which result from no work. A little\r\ntrial soon tells what amount of work, and how much of it, is best adapted\r\nto each pupil; then the daily maintaining of that proportion or kind of\r\nexercise, and its increase, as the newly-acquired strength justifies and\r\ninvites it, is all that is required. Without that hardness and solidity\r\nwhich are essentially masculine, there still comes a firmness and\r\nplumpness of muscle to which the unused arm or back was a stranger.\r\nInstead of these being incompatible with beauty, they are directly\r\naccessory to it. \"Elegance of form in the human figure,\" says Emerson,\r\n\"marks some excellence of structure;\" and again, \"any real increase of\r\nfitness to its end, in any fabric or organism, is an increase of beauty.\"\r\n\r\nLook at the famous beauties of any age, and everything in the picture or\r\nstatue points to this same firmness and symmetry of make, this freedom\r\nfrom either leanness or flabbiness. The Venuses and Junos, the Minervas,\r\nNiobes, and Helens of mythology, the Madonnas, the mediaeval beauties,\r\nall alike have the well-developed and shapely arm and shoulder, the high\r\nchest, the vigorous body, and the firm and erect carriage. Were there a\r\nthin chest or a flat shoulder, a poor and feeble arm or a contracted\r\nwaist, it would at once mar the picture, and bring down on it judgment\r\nanything but favorable. Put now on the canvas or in marble, not the\r\nstrongest and most comely, neither the weakest and least-favored, of our\r\nAmerican girls or women, but simply her who fairly represents the\r\naverage, and, however well the face and expression might suffice,\r\nthe imperfect physical development, and indifferent figure and\r\ncarriage, would at once justly provoke unfavorable comment.\r\n\r\nThat the same vigorous exercise and training which brought forth womanly\r\nphysical beauty in ancient days will bring it out now, there need be no\r\nmanner of doubt. A most apt and excellent case in point was mentioned\r\nin the _New York Tribune_ of June 19th, 1878. It said:\r\n\r\n\"The study and practice of gymnastics are to be made compulsory in all the\r\nState schools in Italy. The apostle of physical culture in that enervating\r\nclimate is Sebastian Fenzi, the son of a Florence banker. He built a\r\ngymnasium at his own expense in that city, and from that beginning the\r\nmovement has extended from city to city. He has preached gymnastics to\r\nsenators and deputies, to the syndic and municipal councillors, and even\r\nto the crown princess, now queen. _He especially inculcates its advantages\r\non all mothers of families, as likely to increase to a remarkable extent\r\nthe personal charms of their daughters._ And so far as his own domestic\r\nexperience goes, his theories have not been contradicted by practice, for\r\n_he is the father of the most beautiful women in Italy_.\"\r\n\r\nSuppose Mr. Durant at Wellesley, or Mr. Caldwell at Vassar, should at\r\nonce introduce in their deservedly famous schools a system of physical\r\neducation which should proceed on the simple but intelligent plan, first\r\nof training the weaker muscles of each pupil until they are as strong as\r\nthe rest, and then of transferring the young woman thus physically\r\nimproved from the class of this or that special work, to that which\r\ninsures to all muscles alike ample, daily vigorous exercise. Suppose\r\nthat all the girls could be made to consider this daily lesson as much a\r\nmatter of course in their studies as anything else. Suppose, again, that\r\nthere is a teacher familiar with the work and all its requirements, one\r\nwho is capable of interesting others, one who fully enters into the\r\nspirit of it. If such a master or mistress can be found, if the pupils\r\nare instructed--whether they be sitting, standing, or walking--to always\r\nremain erect, is there any reason why the Vassar girls should not soon\r\nhave as fine and impressive a carriage as the manly young fellows at the\r\nacademy across the river, but a few miles distant?\r\n\r\nLooking again at the effect on the mental work, would the daily\r\nhalf-hour of exercise in-doors, and the hour's constitutional out-doors,\r\nin all weathers, if sensibly arranged, interfere one whit with all the\r\nintellectual progress the girls could or should make? For, is that a\r\nrational system of intellectual progress which brings out a bright\r\nintellect on a half-developed body, and promises fine things in the\r\nfuture, when the body has had no training adequate to justify the belief\r\nthat there will be much of any future? Is not that rather a dear price\r\nto pay for such intellectuality? Hear Herbert Spencer on this point:\r\n\r\n\"On women the effects of this forcing system are, if possible, even\r\nmore injurious than on men. Being in a great measure debarred from those\r\nvigorous and enjoyable exercises of body by which boys mitigate the\r\nevils of excessive study, girls feel these evils in their full\r\nintensity. Hence the much smaller proportion of them who grow up\r\nwell-made and healthy. In the pale, angular, flat-chested young ladies,\r\nso abundant in London drawing-rooms, we see the effect of merciless\r\napplication unrelieved by youthful sports; and this physical degeneracy\r\nexhibited by them hinders their welfare far more than their many\r\naccomplishments aid it. Mammas anxious to make their daughters\r\nattractive could scarcely choose a course more fatal than this which\r\nsacrifices the body to the mind. Either they disregard the tastes of the\r\nopposite sex, or else their conception of those tastes is erroneous. Men\r\ncare comparatively little for erudition in women, but very much for\r\nphysical beauty and good nature and sound sense. How many conquests does\r\nthe blue-stocking make through her extensive knowledge of history?\"\r\n\r\nThis is a question quite worthy of the consideration of every teacher\r\nof girls in our land, and a paragraph full of suggestion, not\r\nonly to every parent having a child's interests in his or her\r\nkeeping, but to every spirited girl herself as well.\r\n\r\nEvery school-girl in America could be daily practised in a few simple\r\nexercises, calling for no costly, intricate, or dangerous apparatus, taking\r\na little time, but yet expanding her lungs, invigorating her circulation,\r\nstrengthening her digestion, giving every muscle and joint of her body\r\nvigorous play, and so keeping her toned up, and strong enough to be free\r\nfrom much danger either of incurring serious disease, or any of the lighter\r\nailments so common among us. As to her usefulness, no matter where her lot\r\nis to be cast, it will be increased, and, it is not too much to add, her\r\nhappiness would be greatly enhanced through all her life as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nIS IT TOO LATE FOR WOMEN TO BEGIN?\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if the school-days are past and the girl has become a woman, what\r\nthen? If the girl, trammelled by few duties outside of school-hours, has\r\nfound amusement for herself, yet still needs daily and regular exercise\r\nto make and keep her fresh and hearty, much more does the woman,\r\nespecially in a country like our own, where physical exercise for her\r\nsex is almost unknown, require such exercise. Our women are born of\r\nparents who pride themselves on their mental qualifications, on a good\r\ndegree of intelligence. Our educational system is one which offers an\r\nendless variety of spurs to continued mental effort.\r\n\r\nAre not the majority of our women to-day, especially in town and city,\r\nphysically weak? The writers on nervous disorders speak of the astounding\r\nincrease of such diseases among us, of late years, in both sexes, but\r\nespecially among the women. General debility is heard of nowadays almost\r\nas often as General Grant. Most of our women think two miles, or even\r\nless, a long distance to walk, even at a dawdling pace, while few of\r\nthem have really strong chests, backs, or arms. (If they wish to test\r\ntheir arms, for instance, let them grasp a bar or the rung of a ladder,\r\nand try to pull themselves up once till the chin touches. Not two in\r\nfifty will do it, but almost any boy can.) Hardly a day goes by when\r\na woman's strength is not considerably taxed, and often overtaxed.\r\n\r\nThere is no calling of the unmarried woman where vigorous health and\r\nstrength--not great or herculean, but simply such as every well-built and\r\nwell-developed woman ought to have--would not be of great, almost\r\npriceless value to her. The shop-girl, the factory operative, the clerk in\r\nthe store, the book-keeper, the seamstress, the milliner, the telegraph\r\noperator, are all confined, for many hours a day, with exercise for but a\r\nfew of the muscles, and with the trunk held altogether too long in one\r\nposition, and that too often a contracted and unhealthy one. Actually\r\nnothing is done to render the body lithe and supple, to develop the idle\r\nmuscles, to deepen the breathing and quicken the circulation--in short, to\r\ntone up the whole system. No wonder such a day's work, and such a way of\r\nliving, leaves the body tired and exhausted. It would, before long, do the\r\nsame for the strongest man. No wonder that the walk to and from work is a\r\nlistless affair. No wonder that, later on, special or general weakness\r\ndevelops, and the woman goes through life either weak and delicate, or\r\nwith not half the strength and vigor which might readily be hers.\r\n\r\nAnd is it any better with the married woman? Take one of limited means.\r\nMuch of the work about her home which servants might do, could she\r\nemploy them, she bravely does herself, willing to make ten times this\r\nsacrifice, if need be, for those dearest to her. Follow her throughout\r\nthe day, especially where there are children: there is an almost endless\r\nround of duties, many of them not laborious, to be sure, or calling for\r\nmuch muscular strength, but keeping the mind under a strain until they\r\nare done, difficult to encompass because difficult to foresee. In the\r\naggregate they are almost numberless. A man can usually tell in the\r\nmorning most of what is in front of him for the day--indeed, can often\r\nplan so as to say beforehand just what he will be at each hour. But not\r\nso the housewife and mother of young children. She is constantly called\r\nto perform little duties, both expected and unexpected, which cannot\r\nfail to tell on a person not strong. A healthy child a year old will\r\noften weigh twenty pounds; yet a woman otherwise weak will carry that\r\nchild on her left arm several times a day up one or more flights of\r\nstairs, till you would think she would drop from exhaustion. Let\r\nsickness come, and she will often seem almost tireless, so devotedly\r\nwill she keep the child in her arms. While children are, of course,\r\ncarried less when they begin to walk, many a child two, or even three\r\nyears old, is picked up by the mother, not a few times a day, even\r\nthough he weighs thirty or forty pounds instead of twenty. Now for this\r\nmother to have handled a dumb-bell of that weight would have been\r\nthought foolish and dangerous, for nothing about her suggested strength\r\nequal to that performance. And yet the devotion of a weak mother to\r\nher child is quite as great as that of a strong one. Is it any wonder\r\nthat this overdoing of muscles never trained to such work must sooner\r\nor later tell? It would be wonderful if it did not.\r\n\r\nYet now, suppose that same mother had from early childhood been trained to\r\nsystematic physical exercise suited to her strength, and increasing with\r\nthat strength until, from a strong and healthy child, she grew to be a\r\nhearty, vigorous woman, well developed, strong, and comely--what now would\r\nshe mind carrying the little tot on her arm? What before soon became heavy\r\nand a burden--a willing burden though it was--now never seems so at all,\r\nand really is no task for such muscles as she now has. Instead of her\r\nday's work breaking her down, it is no more than a woman of her vigor\r\nneeds--indeed, not so much as she needs--to keep her well and strong.\r\n\r\nAnd, besides escaping the bodily tire and exhaustion, look at the happiness\r\nit brings her in the exhilaration which comes with ruddy health, in the\r\nfeeling of being easily equal to whatever comes up, in being a stranger to\r\nindigestion, to nervousness and all its kindred ailments. This vital force,\r\nsparing her many of the doubts and fears so common to the weak, but which\r\nthe strong seldom know, enables her to endure patiently privation,\r\nwatching, and bereavement. And who is the more likely to live to a ripe old\r\nage, the woman who never took suitable and adequate exercise to give her\r\neven moderate vitality and strength, or she who, by a judicious and\r\nsensible system, suited to her particular needs, has developed such powers?\r\n\r\nBut, while this is all well enough for young girls, is it not too late\r\nfor full-grown women to attempt to get the same benefits? The girl was\r\nyoung and plastic, and, with proper care, could be moulded in almost any\r\nway; but the woman already has her make and set, and these cannot\r\nreadily be changed. Perhaps not quite so readily, but actual trial will\r\nshow that the difficulty is largely imaginary. To many, indeed to most\r\nwomen, the idea is absolutely new, and they never supposed such change\r\npossible. Bryant, beginning at forty, made exercise pay wonderfully.\r\nBear in mind how, with a few minutes a day, Maclaren enlarged and\r\nstrengthened men thirty years old; that, out of his class of over a\r\nhundred, the greatest gain was in the oldest man in it, and he was\r\nthirty-five. Let us look at what one or two women have managed to effect\r\nby systematic and thorough bodily training. In \"The Coming Man\" Charles\r\nReade says (p. 50), \"Nathalie, a French gymnast, and not a woman of\r\nextraordinary build, can take two fifty-six-pound weights from the\r\nground, one in each hand, and put them slowly above her head.\" She has\r\n\"a sister who goes up the slack-rope. Farini saw her pitted against\r\ntwenty sailors. The sailors had a slack-rope; she had another. A sailor\r\nwent up as far as he could; the gymnast went as high on her rope at the\r\nsame time. Sailor came down tired, the lady fresh. Another sailor went\r\nup, the lady ditto; and so on. _She wore out the whole twenty, having\r\ngone up an aggregate of feet higher than St. Peter's Church at Rome._\r\nThis feat is due to great strength, complete either-handedness, and the\r\nathlete's power of pinching a rope with the sinews of the lower limbs.\"\r\n\r\nBut is this great and unusual strength, especially of the arms, desirable\r\nin most women? Not at all; but that is not the point. When Farini says\r\nthat the first step toward making one a skilled gymnast or acrobat is to\r\nbring up the weak arm, and shoulder, and side--usually the left--until\r\nequally strong with its, till now, superior mate, and that he is constantly\r\ndoing that, he is doing more by far than would be needed to make most\r\nwomen, not as strong as acrobats and performers, but--a far more important\r\nmatter--reasonably and comfortably so, sufficiently to keep nervous\r\ndisorders away, to enable them to be far better equal to the daily duties,\r\nand to spend life with an appreciation and zest too often unknown by the\r\nweak woman; finally, to preserve for a woman the bloom and healthy look\r\nwhich once in a while she sees, even in a woman of advanced years, and\r\nwhich would be her own did she use the means to have it.\r\n\r\nAnd what should a woman do to get this health and strength and bloom? Just\r\nwhat is done by the young girl. Indeed, there are a hundred exercises,\r\nalmost any of which, faithfully followed up, would help directly to bring\r\nthe desired result. With her, as with girl or man or boy, the first thing\r\nis to symmetrize, to bring up the weaker muscles by special effort, calling\r\nthem at once into vigorous action, and to restore to its proper position\r\nthe shoulder, back, or chest, which has been so long allowed to remain out\r\nof place. The symmetry once gained, then equal work for all the muscles,\r\ntaken daily, and in such quantities as are found to suit best.\r\n\r\nThe variety of exercises open to woman, especially out-of-doors, is almost\r\nas great as to man. Every one knows some graceful horsewoman, and it is a\r\npity there were not a hundred where there is one. One of the most expert\r\nof our acquaintance is the mother of one of the most gifted metaphysicians\r\nin the land, and he already is a middle-aged man. There are a few ladies\r\nin this country, and a good many in England, who think nothing of a five\r\nor six mile walk daily, and an occasional one of twice that length. Once\r\nin a while a married woman here will do some long-distance skating. In\r\nHolland, in the season, it is with many an every-day affair. Some of the\r\nbest swimmers and floaters at the watering-places are women, and they\r\ncertainly do not look much troubled with nervousness. More than one woman\r\nhas distinguished herself in Alpine climbing. The writer once saw a woman,\r\napparently about twenty-eight, a handsome, vigorous, rosy Englishwoman,\r\nrow her father from Putney to Mortlake, on the Thames, a distance of\r\nfour miles and three furlongs, not at racing pace, to be sure, but\r\nat a lively speed. The measured precision of that lady's stroke,\r\nthe stately poise of the body and head, and the clean, neat, and\r\neffective feathering, would have done credit to an old Oxford oar.\r\n\r\nWhat woman has done, woman may do. Bind one arm in a sling, and keep it\r\nutterly idle for a month, and meanwhile ply the other busily with heavy\r\nwork, such as swinging a hammer, axe, or dumb-bell, and is it hard to say\r\nwhich will be the healthier, the plumper, the stronger--the _live_ arm, at\r\nthe end of the month? And will this only apply to men's arms, and not to\r\nwomen's? Who has usually the stronger, and almost generally the shapelier\r\narm--the woman who, surrounded with servants, takes her royal ease, and has\r\nAmerican notions and ways of exercise, or the busy maid in her kitchen? If\r\nthe latter's arm is large, yet not well-proportioned, it simply means that\r\nsome of its muscles have been used far more than the others.\r\n\r\nNow, to her who understands what exercises will develop each of the muscles\r\nof that arm, and who can tell at sight which are fully developed or\r\ndeveloped at all, and which are not, it is easy to bring up the backward\r\nones, and so secure the symmetry and the consequent general strength. The\r\nsame rule holds good of all the other muscles, as well as those of the arm.\r\n\r\nPlenty of active out-door work will go far toward securing health.\r\nBut it will only develop the parts brought into play, and there\r\nought to be exercise for all.\r\n\r\nNow what daily work, and how much of it, will secure this symmetry,\r\nerectness, and strength, supposing that, at the outset, there is no\r\norganic defect, but that the woman is simply weak both in her muscular\r\nand in her vital systems? In the first place, let it be understood\r\nthat the connection between these systems is intimate, and that the\r\njudicious building and strengthening of the former, and the keeping up\r\nthat strength by sensible daily exercise, tells directly on the\r\nlatter. Vigorous muscular exercise, properly taken, enlarges the\r\nrespiration, quickens the circulation, improves the digestion, the\r\nworking, in fact, of all the vital parts. Dr. Mitchell says it is the\r\nvery thing also to quiet the excited nerves and brain.\r\n\r\nThe amount of that exercise daily depends on the present strength of the\r\nwoman. If she is weak generally, for the first fortnight the exercise,\r\nwhile general enough to bring all the muscles into play, must be light and\r\neasy. Then, as a little strength is gained, the work advances accordingly.\r\nIf partially strong at first, invariably the first thing to do is to adapt\r\nthe exercise mainly to the weaker muscles till they catch up.\r\n\r\nSuppose the right arm is stronger than the left, as frequently happens,\r\nbecause it has had more to do. For the first month--or, if necessary, for\r\nthe first two months--let the left arm have nearly all the exercise, and\r\nthat exercise as vigorous as it can comfortably take. Then, when it is\r\nfound that it can lift or carry as heavy a weight, and pull or push as hard\r\nas the right, keep at it, by means of exercise, until both arms can do the\r\nsame amount of work, and are equal. But suppose the arms are already\r\nequally strong, or, rather, equally weak--that both the back and chest are\r\nsmall; that is, not so large or well-proportioned as they should be in a\r\nwell-built woman of a certain height--then all that is necessary is to\r\nselect work especially adapted to strengthen the back, and other work\r\ntelling directly on the chest. For the first fortnight very mild efforts\r\nshould be made, and the advance should be gradual, taking great care never\r\nonce to overdo it. Let the advance be made as the newly-acquired strength\r\njustifies and encourages it. What particular exercises will effect the\r\nstrengthening and development of any given muscles will be pointed out in\r\nthe chapter on Special Exercise, at the latter part of this book.\r\n\r\nHow about the length of time this daily exercising will take? It is all\r\neasy enough for the rich, whose time is their own, and who could spare four\r\nor five hours a day if necessary; but how is the woman to manage it who\r\nmust work from seven to six, or even far into the evening as well? She can\r\nhardly get time to read about horseback riding and Alpine climbing, much\r\nless take part in them. Well, it is a poor system which cannot suit nearly\r\nall cases. The woman who works steadily from early morning till well into\r\nthe night, especially at employment at all sedentary and confining, is\r\nundergoing a test and a hardship which will certainly call for a strong\r\nconstitution, good condition, and a brave spirit as well, or the strain\r\nwill surely break her down, and bring to her permanent weakness. If so many\r\nhours must be spent in labor, then let her secure ten or fifteen minutes,\r\nupon rising, for a series of exercises in her room. At the dinner-hour,\r\nagain at supper-time, and once about mid-morning, and again at\r\nmid-afternoon, three or five minutes could generally be spared for a few\r\nbrisk exercises calculated to limber and call into vigorous action the\r\nback, and many of the muscles so long held almost motionless until they\r\nstiffen from it. If there is a whole hour at dinner-time, and half of it\r\ncould be spent in walking, if possible with a cheerful and energetic\r\ncompanion, who would make her forget the dull routine of her day--not\r\ndawdling, aimless walking, but stepping out as if she meant it, with a\r\nspring and energy which quickens the pulse, driving the morning's\r\nthoughts out of the mind, scattering low spirits to the winds--it would\r\nbring a pleasant feeling of recreation and change. The benefit to be\r\nderived from such a walk would be immediate and marked.\r\n\r\nIs this asking much? A mile and a half could easily be covered in that\r\ntime, and, by a strong walker, even two, while the dinner would taste twice\r\nas good for the exercise. Another mile, or even half a mile, might be\r\nwalked at supper-time, the pace always being kept up. If the confinement is\r\nso close as not to permit even these few snatches of time for a little\r\nrecreation, never mind. Do not give it up yet. The ten minutes on rising\r\nwere made sure of anyhow.[B] Yes, another chance remains. When at last the\r\nwork is over, even though it is time to retire, get out-of-doors for half\r\nan hour's smart walk with brother or friend, and see how refreshing it will\r\nprove. The jaded body will almost forget its tire, and the sleep which\r\nfollows, while it may not be quite as long as before, will make up in\r\nquality, and the new day will find a far fresher woman, one better up\r\nto her duties, than if no exercise had been taken.\r\n\r\nTo her who does not labor so long, but has her evenings to herself, unless\r\nalready broken by disease, there need be no trouble about getting strong\r\nand healthy. Let her do the little exercise above mentioned till evening;\r\nthen, first eating a hearty supper, beginning with such distance as she can\r\nwalk easily, add to the distance gradually, until she finds herself equal\r\nto four or five miles at a smart pace for her--say three and a half miles\r\nto the hour. (The professional masculine pedestrians do eight miles an\r\nhour, to be sure; but Miss Von Hillern, for instance, is good for about\r\nsix.) This, taken either every evening, or, say, four evenings a week, will\r\nsoon give tone, and make the woman feel strong instead of weak, will enable\r\nher to digest what she eats, and will visibly improve her appetite. Let\r\nher give five or ten minutes for exercising the arms and chest before\r\nretiring, and she has had abundant exercise for that day, while any trouble\r\nshe has had in the past about sleeping is at an end.\r\n\r\nBut sufficient as the evening walk is, of course if it can be had in\r\ndaylight and in the sunshine, it is all the better. Few mothers are\r\nso placed that they cannot each day, by good management, get an hour\r\nfor the care of their health. Let them be sure to take a quick, lively\r\nwalk for the whole time, not with arms held motionless, but swinging\r\neasily as men's do--of course, for the first month taking less\r\ndistances, but working steadily on. They will be astonished at the\r\nvery gratifying difference in the result between it and the old listless\r\nwalk, and how much easier the day's duties come now.\r\n\r\nBut there is one class of women who are especially favored--a large\r\nclass too, in our land--the daughters of parents so well to do that,\r\nbetween their graduation from school and the day they are married, their\r\ntime is practically their own. If weak at the start, let them, after\r\ngradual exercise begins to make them stronger, take more besides the few\r\nminutes at rising and retiring, and the hearty constitutional afoot. If\r\ntheir walking is done in the afternoon, let them set apart half an hour\r\nin the latter part of the morning (if possible, with another girl\r\nsimilarly placed) for work which shall strengthen the arms and the whole\r\ntrunk. If there is a good gymnasium convenient--especially if it has a\r\nteacher of the right stamp--there will be the best place for this work.\r\nBut if not, a little home gymnasium like that suggested later in the\r\nchapter on that subject, and which every girl ought to have, would be\r\nthe place. Very soon this extra work will tell. Look what the four hours\r\na week, just with two-pound wooden dumb-bells, very light Indian clubs,\r\nand light pulley-weights, did for a youth of nineteen in one year![C]\r\nAn increase of an inch in height, of one and a half around the upper\r\narm, of three and a half inches in the girth of the chest, of fifteen\r\npounds in weight--would not these work marked changes in any young\r\nwoman, and would they not nearly always be most desirable changes? It\r\nis not a matter of inches and pounds alone. This increase of girth\r\nand weight is almost sure to tell most beneficially on the health\r\nand spirits as well--in short, on the general vigor.\r\n\r\nIf, with the increase in size and strength, care has been taken to\r\npractise special exercises to make and keep her erect, to at all times,\r\nwhether sitting, standing, or walking, hold the head and neck where they\r\nshould be, there is not much doubt but that, even in one short year, the\r\ndifference in any girl, not strong or straight at the beginning, will be\r\nvery marked. It really lies with young women of this class to make\r\nthemselves physically--in proportion to their height--what they will.\r\n\r\nIs there any need of pointing out to a spirited girl the value of a sound,\r\nhealthy, and shapely body? Is there any sphere in woman's life where it\r\nwill not stand her in good stead, and render her far more efficient at\r\nwhatever she is called on to do--as daughter, sister, wife or mother,\r\nteacher or friend? Nor is the benefit limited even to her own lifetime, but\r\nher posterity are blessed by it as well. Would she like to have inherited\r\nconsumptive tendencies, for instance, from her parent? Will her children\r\nlike any better to inherit the same from her? In our Christian lands, we\r\nfind, if history be correct, that the great men have almost invariably had\r\nremarkable mothers, while their fathers were as often nothing unusual. The\r\nSandwich Island proverb, \"If strong be the frame of the mother, her sons\r\nwill make laws for the people,\" suggests truths that will hold good in many\r\nother places besides the Sandwich Islands. Let every intelligent girl and\r\nwoman in this land bear in mind that, from every point of view, a vigorous\r\nand healthy body, kept toned up by rational, systematic, daily exercise, is\r\none of the very greatest blessings which can be had in this world; that\r\nmany persons spend tens of thousands of dollars in trying to regain even a\r\npart of this blessing when once they have lost it; that the means of\r\ngetting it are easily within the reach of all, who are not already broken\r\nby disease; that it is never too late to begin, and that one hour a day,\r\nproperly spent, is all that is needed to secure it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[B] See (page 169) how Mr. Bryant used those morning minutes,\r\nand how well he was repaid for it, too!\r\n\r\n[C] See page 147.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nWHY MEN SHOULD EXERCISE DAILY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe advantages to men of a well-built body, kept in thorough repair, are\r\nvery great. Those of every class, whose occupation is sedentary, soon\r\ncome to appreciate this. Some part of the machinery gets out of order.\r\nIt may be the head, or eyes, or throat; it may be the lungs or stomach,\r\nliver or kidneys. Something does not go right. There is a clogging, a\r\nlack of complete action, and often positive pain. This physical clogging\r\ntells at once on the mental work, either making its accomplishment\r\nuncomfortable and an effort, or becoming so bad as to actually prevent\r\nwork at all. It may make the man ill. There is very little doubt but\r\nthat a large majority of ailments would be removed, or, rather, would\r\nnever have come at all, had the lungs and also the muscles of the man\r\nhad vigorous daily action to the extent that frequent trial had shown\r\nbest suited to that man's wants. One of the quickest known ways of\r\ndispelling a headache is to give some of the muscles, those of the legs,\r\nfor instance, a little hard, sharp work to do. The reason is obvious.\r\nDr. Mitchell puts it well when he says that muscular exercise flushes\r\nthe parts engaged in it, and so depletes the brain.\r\n\r\nBut fortunately that same exercise also helps make better blood, gets\r\nthe entire lungs into action, quickens the activity of the other vital\r\norgans, and so tones up the whole man, that, if the exercise is taken\r\ndaily and is kept up, disorder, unless very deep-seated, disappears.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that when the system, from any cause, gets run down,\r\ndisease is more likely to enter, and slower at being shaken off. Thousands\r\nand hundreds of thousands of men and women have hard work, mental strain,\r\nfret and anxiety, daily, and for years together--indeed, scarcely do\r\nanything to lighten the tension in this direction. They tell you they are\r\nsubject to headache or dyspepsia, or other disorder, as if it was out of\r\nthe question to think of preventing it. But had the work been so arranged,\r\nas it nearly always could be--far oftener than most persons think--to\r\nsecure daily an hour for vigorous muscular exercise for all the parts, this\r\nrunning down would, in most instances, never come. The sharp, hot work,\r\ntill the muscles are healthily tired, insures the good digestion, the\r\ncleared brain, the sound sleep, the buoyant spirits.\r\n\r\nThe president of one of the largest banks in this country told the\r\nwriter that, disappointed one summer in not getting a run to Europe,\r\nreflection told him that one marked benefit such jaunts had brought him\r\nwas from the increased sleep he was enabled to get, that thereupon he\r\ndetermined on longer sleeps at home. He got them, and found, as he well\r\nput it, that he could \"fight better.\" Beset all day long with men\r\nwanting heavy loans, that fighting tone, that ability to say \"no\" at the\r\nright time and in a way which showed he meant it, must have not only\r\nadded to his own well-being, but to the bank's protection as well.\r\n\r\nAgain, many men are liable to occasionally have sudden and very\r\nprotracted spells of head-work, where sleep and almost everything else\r\nmust give way, so that the business in hand may be gotten through with.\r\n\"Tom Brown\" told the writer that, when in Parliament, he could work\r\nthrough a whole week together on but four hours of sleep a night, and be\r\nnone the worse for it, provided he could have all he wanted the next\r\nweek, and that since he was twenty-five he had hardly known a sick day.\r\n\r\nA father, tired from his day of busy toil, may have a sick child, who\r\nfor much of the night will not let him sleep. Such taxes as this, coming\r\nto one already run down and weak, cannot be braved frequently with\r\nimpunity. Unless the five or six miles a day of Tom Brown and his\r\nfellow-Englishmen's \"constitutional,\" or some equivalent, is resorted\r\nto, and the man kept well toned-up, one of these sudden calls may prove\r\ntoo severe, and do serious if not fatal injury. This toning-up is not\r\nall. If the bodily exercise is such as to get all the muscles strong,\r\nand keep them so, the very work that would otherwise overdo and exhaust\r\nnow has no such effect, but is gone through with spirit and ease. There\r\nis that consciousness of strength which is equal to all such trifles.\r\n\r\nThe very nervousness and worry which used to be so wearing, at the sudden\r\nand ceaseless calls of the day, have gone, and for the reason that strong\r\nnerves and strong muscles are very liable to go together, and not to mind\r\nthese things. What does the athlete at the top of his condition know about\r\nnervousness? He is blithe as a lark all the day long.\r\n\r\nDr. Mitchell says: \"The man who lives an out-door life--who sleeps with\r\nthe stars visible above him, who wins his bodily subsistence at first-hand\r\nfrom the earth and waters--is a being who defies rain and sun, has a\r\nstrange sense of elastic strength, may drink if he likes, and may smoke\r\nall day long, and feel none the worse for it. Some such return to the\r\nearth for the means of life is what gives vigor and developing power to\r\nthe colonists of an older race cast on a land like ours. A few generations\r\nof men living in such fashion store up a capital of vitality which\r\naccounts largely for the prodigal activity displayed by their descendants,\r\nand made possible only by the sturdy contest with nature which their\r\nancestors have waged. That such a life is still led by multitudes of our\r\ncountrymen is what alone serves to keep up our pristine force and energy.\"\r\n\r\nNow, while this extreme hardiness and tone cannot be had by a person who\r\nhas twelve hours of busy brain-work daily in-doors, and only one of bodily\r\nexercise, still, much can be done, quite enough to calm and tranquillize,\r\nand to carry easily over those passes which used to be dreaded.\r\n\r\nIf the man who habitually works too long without a rest would every hour\r\nor so turn lightly from his work, for even sixty seconds, to some vigorous\r\nexercise right in his office, or even in the next room or hall-way, until\r\nthe blood got out of his brain a little, and the muscles tingled with a\r\nhearty glow, he would go back so refreshed as to quickly make up, both in\r\nthe quantity and quality of his work, for the time lost. When his hour for\r\nexercise came, instead of having no heart for it, he would spring to it\r\nwith alacrity, like the school-boy does to his play.\r\n\r\nEven if the strong man does occasionally become jaded, he knows, as\r\nHughes did, how to get back his strength and snap, and that a tired man\r\nis many removes from a tired-out one. There is a great deal in knowing\r\nwhether your work is overdoing you or simply tiring you. One of the\r\nstrongest and best oarsmen Harvard ever had, used, at first, to think he\r\nought to stop rowing when he began to perspire, and was quite astounded\r\nwhen an older man told him that that was only the beginning of the real\r\nwork. There is no end of comfort to a tired man, either mentally or\r\nphysically, in the thought that sure relief is near.\r\n\r\nAgain, this relief by physical exercise will encourage the man to hope\r\nthat, if war or accident do not cut him down, he may look for a long\r\nlife, no matter how great may be the occasional strain. Few men, for\r\ninstance, familiar with the life of the Duke of Wellington will claim\r\nthat they are better workers than he was, or that they get through more\r\nin a day or year, or that, heavy as their responsibilities may be, they\r\nsurpass or even equal those which were his for years together. Yet all\r\nthe terrible mental strain this illustrious man underwent, battling with\r\none of the greatest captains this world ever saw, all the exposure and\r\nforced marching, privation and toil, which come to the faithful soldier,\r\nand to him who holds the lives of multitudes in his hands, this man\r\nknew, and yet so controlled his work, exacting as it all was, as to\r\nmanage to keep his body superior to all it was called on to do, and his\r\nmind in constant working order, and this not merely up to threescore and\r\nten, but to fourscore good years, and three more besides. Did not the\r\nvigorous body at the start, and the daily attention to it, pay him?\r\n\r\nWill it be claimed that the president of one of the best-known\r\ncorporations on this continent did any more work than Wellington? That\r\npresident was at it all day, and far into the night, and when away in\r\nEurope, nominally on a play-spell, as well. Naturally, he was a strong,\r\nenergetic man; but he had so worked, and so neglected his body, that he\r\ndied at fifty-two. Which of the two men showed the better sense?\r\n\r\nWhat does cutting one's self down at fifty-two mean? Five minutes'\r\nreflection should tell any reasonable person that the man was\r\noverworking himself, and going at a pace no man could hold and live.\r\nDoes not this show a lack of sense, and especially when much of that\r\nwork could certainly have been done by subordinates? Was not one of\r\nDaniel Webster's best points his skill in getting work done by\r\nothers, and saving for himself the parts he liked best?\r\n\r\nWhen, after long years of toil and perseverance, one has worked himself\r\nup to position and wide influence, is it sensible to do what his\r\nhumblest employe could rightly tell him is overcrowding, and so forcing\r\nthe pace that he certainly cannot hold it? Instead of taking that\r\nposition and that influence and wielding them for greater ends, and\r\nimproving them very markedly, must there not be a keen pang to their\r\nowner when, tantalized with what seems surely within his grasp, that\r\ngrasp itself weakens, and the machine goes all to pieces?\r\n\r\nThese later years are especially the precious ones to the wealthy man.\r\nThey are his best days. Then his savings, and his earnings too,\r\naccumulate as they did not when he was younger. Look at the work done by\r\nVanderbilt, for example, accomplished almost thirty years after he was\r\nfifty-two! Did not the active out-door life on the little periauger of\r\nhis youth, and the daily constitutionals which, notwithstanding his\r\ninfirmities, all New Yorkers saw him taking in later life, pay him?\r\nAnd are they less precious in any other line of life?\r\n\r\nLook for a moment at the value health is to a man in any of the\r\nlearned professions--of having a sound and vigorous body, with each\r\nbranch of his vital system working regularly, naturally, and in\r\nharmony with the rest. Do these things make no difference to the\r\ndivine? Had the sturdy, prize-fighter make of Martin Luther nothing\r\nto do with his contempt for the dangers awaiting his appearance before\r\nCharles V. and his Diet of Worms, and which caused him to say he would\r\ngo there though the devils were as thick as the tiles on the houses;\r\nand with the grand stand he made for the religious light which\r\nnow shines so freely upon the whole Christian world?\r\n\r\nThomas Guthrie, first tying one hand behind him, with the other could whip\r\nany man in Oxford who would also fight one-handed. Who doubts that the\r\nvigor so evinced had much to do with the faithful, arduous life's work he\r\ndid, and did so well that all Scotland is to-day justly proud of him?\r\n\r\nHave the magnificent breadth and depth of Spurgeon's chest, and his\r\nsplendid outfit of vital organs, no connection with his great power and\r\ninfluence as a preacher of world-wide renown? Have the splendid\r\nphysique and abounding vitality of Henry Ward Beecher--greater almost\r\nthan that of any man in a hundred thousand--nothing to do with his\r\nability to attend to his duties as pastor, author, lecturer, and\r\neditor--work enough to kill half a dozen ordinary men--and with the\r\ntireless industry which must precede his marked success in them all?\r\nAre not the towering form, the ruddy health, and grand, manly vigor of\r\nDr. John Hall weighty elements, first in putting together, and then in\r\ndriving home, the honest, earnest, fearless words which all remember\r\nwho ever heard him speak? Have not the great bodies of those two young\r\ngiants of the American pulpit, Phillips Brooks and Joseph Cook,\r\nproved most valuable accessories to their great brains?\r\n\r\nIs there anything feeble about any of these? Put the tape-measure around\r\nthem anywhere you like, and see how generous nature has been with them.\r\nIs it all a mere chance that they happen to have splendid bodies? Why is\r\nit that we never hear of such as these having \"ministers' sore throat,\"\r\nand \"blue Mondays,\" and having to be sent by their congregations, every\r\nnow and then, away to a foreign land to recruit their health and keep\r\nthem up to their work? Do sound and sturdy bodies, and due attention\r\ndaily to keeping them in good repair, have nothing to do with their\r\nability to cope at all times with the duty lying next to them--and with\r\ntheir attention to it, too, in such a way as to make them so much more\r\neffective than other men in their great life's work?\r\n\r\nThat the physician himself needs sound health and plentiful strength,\r\nfew will question; and yet, does he, from his calling alone, do anything\r\nto insure it? Dragged from his bed at all hours of the night, thrown\r\ndaily, almost hourly, in contact with deadly disease--often so\r\ncontagious that others shrink from going where he goes, like the brave\r\nman he must be to face such dangers--would not that general toned-up\r\ncondition of the thoroughly sound and healthy man prove a most valuable\r\nboon to him--indeed, often save his life? And yet, does his daily\r\noccupation insure him that boon, even though it does enable him to get\r\nout-of-doors far more than most men who earn their living by mental\r\nlabor? Witness one of their own number, Dr. Mitchell, on this point; for\r\nhe says, \"The doctor, who is supposed to get a large share of exercise,\r\nin reality gets very little after he grows too busy to walk, and has\r\nthen only the incidental exposure to out-door air.\" Would not a sensible\r\ncourse of physical exercise daily pay him--especially when pretty much\r\nall the muscular work he gets of any account is for his forearms and a\r\nlittle of his back, and then only when he drives a hard-bitted horse?\r\n\r\nAnd does not a lawyer need a good body, and one kept in good order? After\r\nthe first few years, when his practice is once well established, he finds\r\nthat, unlike men in most other callings, his evenings are not his own, and\r\nthat, if he is going to read any law, and to attempt to keep up with the\r\nnew decisions every year, even in his own State, what between court work,\r\nthe preparation of his cases, drawing papers, consultation,\r\ncorrespondence, and the other matters which fill up the daily round of the\r\nlawyer in active practice, that reading will have to be done out of\r\noffice-hours often, or not done at all. Even in his evenings his business\r\nis too pressing to allow any time for reading. Here, then, is a man who is\r\nin serious danger of being cut off from that rest and recreation which most\r\nother men can have. The long, steady strain, day and evening, often breaks\r\nhim down, where an hour's active exercise daily on the road or on the\r\nwater, with his business for the time scrupulously forgotten, together with\r\nfrom a quarter to half an hour, on rising and retiring, in strengthening\r\nhis arms and chest, would have kept him as tough and fresh as they did\r\nBryant, not simply up to sixty, or even seventy, but clear up to his\r\neighty-fourth year. Every lawyer who has been in active practice in any of\r\nour large cities for a dozen years can point to members of his Bar who have\r\neither broken clean down, and gone to a premature grave from neglecting\r\ntheir bodily health, or who are now far on the road in that same direction.\r\nThis happens notwithstanding the fact that in many places the courts do\r\nnot sit once during the whole summer, and lawyers can hence get\r\nlonger vacations and go farther from home than most men.\r\n\r\nLet any one read the life of Rufus Choate, and say whether there was any\r\nneed of his dying an old man at fifty-five. He started not with a weak\r\nbody, but one decidedly strong. So little care did he take of it that, as\r\nhe himself well put it, \"latterly he hadn't much of any constitution, but\r\nsimply lived under the by-laws.\" Did it hinder his distinguished compeer,\r\nDaniel Webster, from magnificent success at the bar because he took many\r\na good play-spell with a fishing-rod in his hand? because he not only\r\nknew but regarded the advantage and wisdom of keeping his body toned-up\r\nand hearty, and so regarded it that he died, not at fifty-five, but at\r\nthe end of the full threescore years and ten? And did grand physical\r\npresence, the most impressive which ever graced American forum or\r\nsenate-chamber--so striking, in fact, that, as he walked the streets of\r\nLiverpool, the laboring men stopped work and backed their admiring gaze\r\nby concluding that he must be a king--did these qualities not contribute\r\nto that same magnificent success? Daniel O'Connell was a man of sturdier\r\nbody even than Webster, of whom Wendell Phillips says: \"He was the\r\ngreatest orator that ever spoke English. A little O'Connell would have\r\nbeen no O'Connell. Every attitude was beauty, every gesture grace.\r\nThere was a magnetism that melted every will into his.\"\r\n\r\nHad not this wonderful man much to thank these same qualities for? Had\r\nthey not something to do with the stretching of his vigorous life, not\r\nmerely up to fifty-five, or even to seventy, but clear up to\r\nseventy-three? How many men has the world ever seen who filled, and well\r\nfilled, more high offices than Henry Brougham, and who, no matter where\r\nhe was, was always a tireless worker? One biographer says that, as a\r\nboy, he was the fleetest runner in the neighborhood, and this man, \"as\r\nan orator, second in his time only to Canning;\" this man, who once spoke\r\nin Parliament for seven days consecutively, who, even when upward of\r\nseventy, showed his zeal for reform by urging the introduction into\r\nEngland of the New York Code of Procedure--this one of England's\r\nmost famous Lord Chancellors took such care of his body that he\r\nnever ceased from his labors until he was eighty-nine.\r\n\r\nLet us look at but one more instance of the way a powerful mind and an\r\nuncommonly strong body blend and aid their possessor to his purposes. A\r\nrecent writer in \"Blackwood\" says of Bismarck: \"_He is a powerful man. That\r\nis what strikes at once every one who sees him for the first time._ He is\r\nvery tall and of enormous weight, but not ungainly. Every part of his\r\ngigantic frame is well-proportioned--the large round head, the massive\r\nneck, the broad shoulders, and the vigorous limbs. He is now more than\r\nsixty-three, and the burden he has had to bear has been usually heavy; but\r\nthough his step has become slow and ponderous, he carries his head\r\nhigh--looking down, even, on those who are as tall as himself--and his\r\nfigure is still erect. During these latter years he has suffered frequent\r\nand severe bodily pain, but no one could look upon him as an old man, or as\r\none to be pitied. On the contrary, everybody who sees him feels that\r\n_Prince Bismarck is still in possession of immense physical power_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd what holds good as to professional men in this respect of course will\r\napply with equal force to busy brain-workers in any other line as well. It\r\nis nowhere claimed here that there have not been in many callings great men\r\nwhose bodies were indifferent affairs, but endeavor has been made to show,\r\nnot only that a great mind and a vigorous body can go together, but that\r\nthe latter is, not to the man of unusual mental power alone, but to every\r\nman, a most valuable acquisition, and one that he should, if he does not\r\npossess it already, take prompt steps to secure, and then, once acquiring\r\nit, should use the means, as Bryant did, to retain it.\r\n\r\nIn the 1877-'78 annual report of Harvard College, President Eliot, who\r\nhas been exceptionally well-placed to observe several thousand young men,\r\nand to know what helps and what hinders their intellectual progress, adds\r\nhis valuable testimony to the importance of vigorous health and regular\r\nphysical exercise to all who have, or expect to have, steady and severe\r\nmental work to do. Busy professional men may well heed his words. Speaking\r\nof the value of scholarships to poor but deserving young men, he says: \"If\r\nsound health were one of the requisitions for the enjoyment of\r\nscholarships, parents who expected to need aid in educating their boys\r\nwould have their attention directed in an effective way to the wise\r\nregimen of health; while young men who had their own education to get\r\nwould see that it was only prudent for them to secure a wholesome diet,\r\nplenty of fresh air, and _regular exercise_. A singular notion prevails,\r\nespecially in the country, that it is the feeble, sickly children who\r\nshould be sent to school and college, since they are apparently unfit for\r\nhard work. The fact that, in the history of literature, a few cases can be\r\npointed out in which genius was lodged in a weak or diseased body, is\r\nsometimes adduced in support of the strange proposition that physical\r\nvigor is not necessary for professional men. But all experience\r\ncontradicts these notions. _To attain success and length of service in any\r\nof the learned professions, including that of teaching, a vigorous body is\r\nwell-nigh essential._ A busy lawyer, editor, minister, physician, or\r\nteacher has need of _greater physical endurance_ than a farmer, trader,\r\nmanufacturer, or mechanic. All professional biography teaches that\r\n_to win lasting distinction in sedentary, in-door occupations,\r\nwhich task the brain and the nervous system, extraordinary toughness\r\nof body must accompany extraordinary mental powers_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nHOME GYMNASIUMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that people need for their daily in-door exercises is a few pieces of\r\napparatus which are fortunately so simple and inexpensive as to be within\r\nthe reach of most persons. Buy two pitchfork handles at the agricultural\r\nstore. Cut off enough of one of them to leave the main piece a quarter of\r\nan inch shorter than the distance between the jambs of your bedroom door,\r\nand square the ends. On each of these jambs fasten two stout hard-wood\r\ncleats, so slotted that the squared ends of the bar shall fit in snugly\r\nenough not to turn. Let the two lower cleats be directly opposite each\r\nother, and about as high as your shoulder; the other two also opposite each\r\nother, and as high above the head as you can comfortably reach.\r\n\r\nAgain, bore into the jamb, at about the height of your waist, a hole as\r\nlarge as the bar is thick. Now work the auger farther into each hole,\r\ntill it reaches the first piece of studding, and then an inch or so into\r\nthat. Find how many inches it is from the jamb to the end of the bore in\r\nthe studding, and cut the second fork handle in halves. Pass one half\r\nthrough the hole in the jamb, and set its end into the hole in the\r\nstudding. Bore a similar hole in the other jamb directly opposite, and\r\nrepeat the last-named process with its nearest studding-piece, and\r\nadjust remainder of the fork handle to it. Now cut enough off each piece\r\nof the handle to leave the distance between the two about eighteen\r\ninches. You have then provided yourself with a pair of bars on which you\r\ncan try one of the exercises usually practised on the parallel bars, and\r\nthat one worth almost as much as all the rest. (See Fig. 3.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. Horizontal Bar and Chest-bars, for Home Use.]\r\n\r\nOn the following page is a sketch of a pair of pulley-weights recently\r\nmade, designed by Dr. Sargent, which are excellent. Their merits will be\r\nseen at a glance. Instead of the weights swaying sideways and banging\r\nagainst the boxes, as they are liable to do in the ordinary old-fashioned\r\npulley-weight boxes, they travel in boxes, A A, between the rods B B. A\r\nrubber bed also prevents the weight from making a noise as it strikes the\r\nfloor, while another capital feature is the arrangement of boxes, in which\r\nyou may graduate the weight desired by adding little plates of a pound\r\neach, instead of the unchanging weight of the old plan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. Noiseless Pulley-weights.]\r\n\r\nOne of these boxes, with its load, can easily be used as a\r\nrowing-weight, by rigging a pulley-wheel a few inches above the floor,\r\nand directly in front of the weight box, and then making the rope long\r\nenough to also pass under this pulley. A stick of the thickness of an\r\noar handle can then be attached to the end of the rope. If the\r\nold-fashioned pulley-weights are preferred, as they are cheaper, long\r\nboxes take the place of these iron rods, and a common iron weight\r\ntravels up and down in the boxes. At some of the gymnasiums--that of the\r\nYoung Men's Christian Association in New York, for example--these\r\nweights, of various sizes, snaffles, ropes, and handles, can all\r\nbe had, of approved pattern and at reasonable rates.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have a horizontal bar fitted for most of the uses of that\r\nvaluable appliance, a pair of parallel bars, or their equivalent for\r\ncertain purposes, a pair of pulling-weights, and a rowing-weight. Now,\r\nwith the addition of a pair of dumb-bells, weighing at first about one\r\ntwenty-fifth of the user's own weight, we have a gymnasium more\r\ncomprehensive than most persons would imagine. Mr. Bryant was contented\r\nfor forty years with less apparatus even than this, and yet look at the\r\nbenefit he derived from it![D] The bar, cleats, and parallels ought to\r\nbe made and put up for not over two dollars, and four or five dollars\r\nmore will cover the cost of pulling-weights and gear on the old plan,\r\nunless a heavy rowing-weight is added, which can be had at five cents a\r\npound, which is also the price of well-shaped dumb-bells.\r\n\r\nHere is a gymnasium, then, under cover, rent free, exactly at hand, when\r\none is lightly clad on rising or just before retiring, which takes up\r\nbut little room, can hardly get out of order, which will last a dozen\r\nyears. With these few bits of apparatus every muscle of the trunk,\r\nnearly all those of the legs, and all those of the arms, can, by a few\r\nexercises so simple that they can be learned at a single trying, be\r\nbrought into active play. The bar in the upper place will be useful\r\nmainly for grasping, hanging, or swinging on by the hands, or for\r\npulling one's self up until the chin touches it. In the lower place it\r\nenables one to perform very many of the exercises usual on the\r\nhorizontal bar. The short bars or handles have scarcely more than\r\none office, but that is one of the most important of all exercises\r\nfor the weak-armed and the weak-chested. This exercise is the one\r\ncalled \"dipping.\" The bars are grasped with the hands, the feet being\r\nheld up off the floor; then, starting with the elbows straight,\r\ngradually lowering until the elbows are bent as far as possible,\r\nthen rising till they are straight again, and so continuing.\r\n\r\nThe pulley-weights admit of a great variety of uses, reaching\r\ndirectly every muscle of the hand, wrist, arm, shoulder, chest,\r\nabdomen, the entire back and neck; while, by placing one foot in the\r\nhandle and pulling the weight with it, several of the leg muscles\r\nsoon have plenty to do, as is also the case with the rowing-weight.\r\nThe field of the dumb-bells is hardly less extensive.\r\n\r\nIf but one of these pieces of apparatus can be had, the pulley-weights\r\nare the most comprehensive, and so the most important, though it is\r\nastonishing how closely the dumb-bells follow; and then they have the\r\ngreat advantage of being portable. Combine with the exercises you can\r\nget from all this apparatus those which need none at all, such as rising\r\non the toes, hopping, stooping low, walking, running, leaping, and no\r\nmore tools are needed to develop whatever muscles one likes. What\r\nspecial work will employ any particular muscle will be indicated later.\r\n\r\nIf the apparatus is only to be used by a man or boy, a striking-bag can\r\nbe made of seven or eight pieces of soft calf-skin, so that the whole,\r\nwhen full of sawdust, shall be either round like a ball or pear-shaped,\r\nand shall be about fifteen inches in horizontal diameter. This should be\r\nhung on a rope from a hook screwed into one of the beams of the ceiling.\r\nThis makes a valuable acquisition to the snug little home-gymnasium.\r\nFor a person having a weak chest, and who aims to broaden and deepen\r\nthat important region, perhaps no better and safer contrivance can\r\nbe had than the one sketched in Fig. 8, on page 248.\r\n\r\nThe fact of having a few bits of apparatus close at hand, when one is\r\nlightly clad, will tend to tempt any one to get at them a little while\r\nmorning and evening. If a parent wants children to use them, instead of\r\nplacing the apparatus in his own room, the nursery, or an empty room\r\nwhere all can have ready access, would be better. Of course, in such\r\ncase there should be additional weights, and dumb-bells suited to the\r\nage and strength of those who are to use them.[E] Indeed, by providing\r\nchildren at home with articles which they like to use, and the use of\r\nwhich brings much direct good, the nursery has a new value--greater,\r\nperhaps, when made the most of, than it ever had before. All the\r\nexercises needed to make children strong can be readily learned, as all\r\nof them are exceedingly simple. In another place these exercises will be\r\nindicated. The parent can then select those exercises he sees the child\r\nneeds, and teach them in a few minutes, so arranging it as to get the\r\nchildren to exercise a certain time every day. As has been shown, the\r\ncost of all these appliances will not be nearly as much as a moderate\r\ndoctor's bill, and quite as little as the patent gymnastic articles,\r\nwhich are so often praised, mostly by people who know little or nothing\r\nof other forms of exercise than those fitted to their own apparatus. A\r\nlarge beam, for instance, has been devised, with handles fastened by a\r\ncontrivance above it, which is meant to restore the spine (when out of\r\nplace) to its proper position. But there is scarcely anything it can\r\naccomplish which cannot readily be done on some one of these simple,\r\nold-fashioned, and far less cumbrous pieces of apparatus.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the large cities there are establishments where the chief and\r\nalmost the sole exercise is with the lifting-machine. A person, standing\r\nnearly erect, is made to lift heavy weights often of several hundred,\r\nand even a thousand or more pounds. The writer, when a lad of seventeen,\r\nworked a few minutes nearly every day for six months on a machine of\r\nthis kind; and while it seemed a fine thing to lift six hundred pounds\r\nat first, and over a thousand toward the end, there came an unquestioned\r\nstiffening of the back, as though the vertebrae were packed so closely\r\ntogether as to prevent their free action. There came also a very\r\nnoticeable and abnormal development of three sets of muscles: those of\r\nthe inner side of the forearm, the lower and inner end of the front\r\nthigh just above the knee, and those highest up on the back, branching\r\noutward from the base of the neck. With considerable other vigorous\r\nexercise taken at the same time, this heavy lifting still produced the\r\nmost marked effect, so that the development caused by it was soon large,\r\nout of all proportion compared with that resulting from the other work.\r\n\r\nNow, if it is the fact that they who practice on the \"health lift\"\r\nordinarily take little or no other vigorous exercise, why is not this same\r\npartial development going to result? And if this is the case, is it not\r\nrather a questionable exercise, especially for those to whom it is so\r\nhighly recommended--the sedentary--and even worse for those who stand at\r\ndesks all day? We have seen it make one very stiff and ungainly in his\r\nmovements, and it is natural that it should; for he who does work of the\r\ngrade suited to a truck-horse is far more likely to acquire the heavy and\r\nponderous ways of that worthy animal than he who spreads his exercise over\r\nall, or nearly all, his muscles, instead of confining it to a few, and who\r\nmakes many vigorous and less hazardous efforts instead of a single mighty\r\none. All the muscles of the arm, for instance, which are used in striking\r\nout, putting up a dumb-bell, or any sort of pushing, are wholly idle\r\nin this severe pulling--more so, even, than they are in the oarsman\r\nwhen rowing. Hence, unless they get even work, there will be loss of\r\nsymmetry, one-sided development, and only partial strength.\r\n\r\nAnother popular piece of apparatus is the \"parlor gymnasium;\" and, though\r\nneedlessly expensive, it is a surprisingly useful affair, if once one knows\r\nhow to use it to the best effect. But it has some disadvantages which,\r\nwhile not conceded by its inventor, it is yet well enough to know. In its\r\nmore elaborate and complete form it is called the \"Parlor Rowing\r\nApparatus,\" and is also described as \"the most complete rowing apparatus in\r\nthe world.\" In reality it is very poorly adapted to the oarsman's wants,\r\nand tends to get him into habits he should, if he wishes to be a good oar,\r\nbe careful to refrain from. It is a matter of supreme importance in rowing\r\nto get a strong grip at the beginning of the stroke, and to put the weight\r\non heavily then; while it is a glaring fault to do anything like jerking\r\ntoward the end of the stroke. But with this parlor rowing-machine, instead\r\nof lifting a solid weight, as in the ordinary rowing-weight, a rubber\r\nstrap, or, rather, two rubber straps, are simply stretched while the stroke\r\nis pulled, and then slackened to begin the next. The trouble is that the\r\nstraps have to be pulled nearly half the length of the stroke before it\r\nbegins to grow hard to pull, so that throwing one's weight on heavily at\r\nthe beginning causes the rower to feel somewhat as he would if, in taking a\r\nstroke in a boat, his oar-blade had missed the water entirely, or as a\r\nboxer who unexpectedly beats the air. The better the beginning of a stroke\r\nis caught in the water, the more the fulcrum of water itself solidifies,\r\nand by so much more can the rower throw his weight on then, and at just the\r\nright time. The effect with the rubber straps is the very reverse; for, in\r\nthrowing the weight on at the beginning, the straps do not offer enough\r\nresistance to have the desired effect, while they offer too much at the\r\nfinish of the stroke. This same defect stands out plainly in some of the\r\npushing exercises done with it, as well as in using it as a\r\nlifting-machine, making it necessary, for the latter purpose, not to catch\r\nhold of the handles at all, but, as we have seen the inventor himself do,\r\nsomewhere toward the middle of the straps, else the knees would get\r\nentirely straightened before the tension became great, which would force\r\nthe bulk of the work to be done with the hands. Great care must be taken,\r\nalso, to have the bolts at the farther ends of these straps fastened very\r\nfirmly into the wood-work, or wherever they are attached; for if, under a\r\nheavy pull, one of these bolts should work out, it would be in great danger\r\nof striking the performer in the eye or elsewhere with terrific force.\r\n\r\nStill, with these few defects, this parlor rowing apparatus is an excellent\r\ncontrivance, and, used intelligently and assiduously, ought to bring almost\r\nany development a person might reasonably hope for, though its range is\r\nhardly as wide as that of these few bits of house apparatus before named,\r\nwhen taken together. There is nothing novel about the latter, excepting Dr.\r\nSargent's apparatus for the chest. All have been known for a generation or\r\nmore. But the many uses of them are but little known, and their\r\nintroduction into our homes and schools has hardly yet begun. Yet, so wide\r\nis the range of exercise one can have with them, and of exercise of the\r\nvery sort so many people need; and so simple is the method of working them,\r\nso free, too, from danger or anything which induces one to overwork, and so\r\ninexpensive are they and easy to make, that they ought to be as common in\r\nour homes as are warm carpets and bright firesides. Every member of the\r\nfamily, both old and young, should use them daily, enough to keep both the\r\nhome-gymnasium and its users in good working order.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[D] See page 169.\r\n\r\n[E] See page 266.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOOL THE TRUE PLACE FOR CHILDREN'S PHYSICAL CULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, well adapted as our homes are in many ways for the proper care and\r\ndevelopment of the body, there is one place which, in almost every\r\nparticular, surpasses them in this direction, if its advantages are\r\nunderstood and fully appreciated, and that is the school. A father may so\r\narrange his time that a brief portion of it daily can be regularly\r\nallotted to the physical improvement of the children, as John Stuart\r\nMill's father did his for his son's mental improvement, and with such\r\nremarkable results. But most fathers, from never having formed the habit,\r\nwill be slow to learn it, and their time is already so taken up that it\r\nwill seem impossible to spare any. The mother, being more with the child,\r\nfeels its needs and lacks the more keenly, and would gladly deny herself\r\nmuch could she assure her children ruddy health. But her day is also by no\r\nmeans an idle one, and, just when she could best spare half an hour, it is\r\nhardest to have them with her. Besides, in too many instances she is\r\nherself far from strong, and needs some one to point out to her the way to\r\nphysical improvement more, even, than do her children.\r\n\r\nThere is a feeling that the child is sent to _school_ to be educated, and\r\nthat certain trained persons are paid to devote their time to that\r\neducation. As they are supposed to bring the children forward in certain\r\ndirections, this leads easily to the conclusion that they would be the\r\nproper persons to care for other parts of that education as well. Nor is\r\nthis view so wide of the mark. The teacher has always a considerable number\r\nof scholars. He can encourage the slower by the example of the quicker; he\r\ncan arouse the emulation, he can get work easily out of a number together,\r\nwhere one or two would be hard to move. If he rightly understood his power;\r\nif he knew how easy it is, by a little judicious daily work, to prevent or\r\nremove incipient deformity, to strengthen the weak, to form in the pupil\r\nthe habit of sitting and standing erect, to add to the general strength, to\r\nfreshen the spirits, and do good in other ways, he would gladly give\r\nwhatever time daily would be necessary to the work, while, like most\r\npersons who try to benefit others, he would find that he himself would gain\r\nmuch by it as well. He has not a class of pupils stiffened by long years of\r\nhard overwork of some muscles, and with others dormant and undeveloped.\r\nThe time when children are with him is almost the best time in their whole\r\nlives to shape them as he chooses, not morally or mentally only, but\r\nphysically as well. The one shoulder, a little higher than its mate, will\r\nnot be half so hard to restore to place now as when confirmed in its\r\nposition by long years of a bad habit, which should never have been\r\ntolerated a day. If the chest is weak and flat, or pigeon-breasted, now is\r\nthe time to remove the defect. Build up the arms to be strong and comely\r\nnow; accustom the chest and shoulders to their proper place, whatever their\r\nowner is at; cover the back with full and shapely muscles; get the feet\r\nused to the work which comes so easy and natural to them, once they are\r\ntrained aright; and the same boy who would have grown up half-built,\r\nungraceful, and far from strong, will now ripen into a manly, vigorous,\r\nwell-knit man, of sound mind and body, familiar with the possibilities of\r\nthat body, with what is the right use and what the abuse of it, and knowing\r\nwell how to keep it in that condition which shall enable him to accomplish\r\nthe best day's mental labor. And he will be far fitter to face the\r\nprivations, anxieties, and troubles of life in the most successful way.\r\n\r\nNor is the rule at all difficult to follow. Little by little the boy's mind\r\nis led along, until the difficult problem in arithmetic seems no harder to\r\nhim than did the adding of two and two at first. For hundreds of years the\r\nmental training of youth has been a matter of careful thought and study,\r\nand no effort is spared to secure the best advantages of all the teaching\r\nof the past. But with that past before him; with its many great men--not\r\nalways, to be sure, but so often--men whose bodies were sturdy, and equal\r\nto the tremendous tasks which their great activity of mind led them\r\nwillingly to assume, he is encouraged and urged to keep his mind under\r\ncontinual pressure for many hours daily, and every incentive is brought\r\nto make the most of him in this direction. And yet that which would\r\nhave helped him in almost every step he took, which would have fitted\r\nhim to stand with ease what now in a few years so often breaks him\r\ndown, is totally ignored and left quite out of sight.\r\n\r\nIt is plainly no fault of his. The blame lies with the system which, for\r\ngenerations together, has gone along so blindly. The life a farmer's son\r\nleads makes him strong and hearty, and when his school-days are over his\r\nwork is of such a sort as to maintain all his vigor. The city lad who\r\nplays on the brick sidewalks, born often of half-developed parents, has\r\nno daily tasks which bring his muscles into vigorous play, strengthening\r\nhis digestion. Is there any possible reason why the city lad should be\r\nfavored physically like the country boy? The first has every\r\nincentive for daily exercise, the latter none at all.\r\n\r\nThere ought to be no more delay in this matter of physical education in\r\nthe schools. Prompt and vigorous steps should be taken to acquaint every\r\nschool-teacher in this country with such exercises as would quickly\r\nrestore the misshapen, insure an erect carriage, encourage habits of\r\nfull breathing, and strengthen the entire trunk and every limb. If the\r\nteachers have not the requisite knowledge now, let it at once be\r\nacquired. They, of all persons, are expected to know how to acquire\r\nknowledge, and to aid others in doing the same. As soon as they have\r\ngained even partial knowledge of how to effect these things, let them\r\nlose no time in imparting that knowledge to the pupil.\r\n\r\nPhysical education ought to be made compulsory in every school in this\r\nland. Have it directly under the eye and guidance of the teacher, and\r\nhave that teacher know that, at the quarterly or semi-annual\r\nexaminations, reasonable progress will be expected in this department\r\njust as certainly as in any other, and if he is not up to his work, that\r\nsome one who is will be put in his place. Then that progress will surely\r\ncome. It has come already, where the means have been understood and\r\nused, as witness Maclaren abroad and Sargent here; and it brings such a\r\nbenefit to the pupil that no pains should be spared to insure it.\r\n\r\nScarcely a week passes but the press of our larger cities repeats the story\r\nof some overworked man or woman breaking completely down with general\r\ndebility, the body not only a wreck, but too often the mind as well. Had\r\nthat body been early shaped, and hardened, and made vigorous--as, for\r\ninstance, Chief-justice Marshall's father looked to it that his great son's\r\nwas--and the habit formed of taking daily work, and of the right sort to\r\nkeep it so, and had the importance of that care been impressed on the\r\nmind till it had fixed itself as firmly as the sense of decency or the\r\nneed of being clean, is it likely that the person would have allowed\r\nhimself to get so run down, or, if he did, to remain so?\r\n\r\nThe trouble usually is that the man does not know what to do to tone\r\nhimself up and keep himself equal to his tasks, or that it needs but a\r\nlittle to effect this. He will spend money like water; he will travel\r\nfast and far; he will do almost anything, but he knows no certain cure.\r\nIs it not as important to have good health and strength as to figure or\r\nwrite correctly, to read the AEneids or Homer, to pick up a smattering\r\nof French or German? Who is the more likely, if his life be in-door\r\nand sedentary, not to live half his days--he who has never learned\r\nto build and strengthen his body, and keep it regulated and healthy,\r\nand to know the value of that health, or he who has?\r\n\r\nIs not work which will almost surely lengthen one's life, and increase his\r\nusefulness, worth doing, especially when it takes but a very little while\r\ndaily to do it, and less yet when the habit commenced in childhood? Go\r\nthrough our public and private schools, and see how few thoroughly\r\nwell-built boys and girls there are. Good points are not scarce, but how\r\nsmall the proportion of the deep-chested, the well-made and robust, who\r\ngive good promise of making strong and healthy men and women! Fortunately\r\nthere is nothing really difficult in the work of strengthening the weak,\r\nmaking the somewhat crooked straight, of symmetrizing the partially\r\ndeveloped; indeed, on the other hand, it is, when once understood,\r\nsimple, inexpensive, and easy. More than all this, it is a work which\r\nthe teacher will find that almost every scholar will take hold of, not,\r\nas in many other branches, with reluctance, but with alacrity; and it\r\nis always pleasant teaching those who are eager to learn.\r\n\r\nBut a little time each day is needed, never over half an hour of actual\r\nwork in-doors and an hour out-of-doors. Suppose a teacher has forty\r\npupils, and that thirty of them have either weak or indifferent chests.\r\nLet her form a chest-class out of the thirty, and, for ten minutes a day,\r\nlet them practice exercises aimed exclusively to enlarge and develop the\r\nchest. Some of such exercises will be pointed out on page 245. Begin very\r\ngradually, so mildly that the weakest chest there shall have no ache or\r\npain from the exercise. For the first week do that same work, and that\r\nmuch of it daily, and no more; but do it carefully, and do not miss a\r\nstroke. Let this exercise come at the appointed hour, as certainly as any\r\nother study. The second week make the work a trifle harder, or longer, or\r\nboth. In this, and in every exercise, insist, as far as possible, on an\r\nerect carriage of the head and neck, and frequently point out their value.\r\nInsist, further, on the pupil's always inhaling as large, and full, and\r\nslow breaths as he can, seeing to it that every air-cell is brought into\r\nvigorous play. Be careful that he or she does not, without your knowledge,\r\nget hold of heavier apparatus, or try more difficult exercise in the same\r\ndirection, before the muscles are trained to take it. Overdoing is not\r\nonly useless, and sure to bring stiffness and aches, but it is in it that\r\nany danger lies, never in light and simple work, adapted to the pupil's\r\npresent strength, and done under the teacher's eye, or in heavier work\r\nafter he has been trained gradually up to it. Now, when a fortnight\r\nhas gone by, use a little heavier weights; stay at the work without\r\nweights a little longer, or draw the pulley-weight a few more strokes\r\ndaily, never forgetting to hold the head and neck erect.\r\n\r\nWill dumb-bells and weight-boxes be necessary? Yes, or their\r\nequivalents. If the former cannot be had, flat-irons or cobble-stones of\r\nthe same weight will do pretty well, and sand-bags can be used in the\r\nweight-boxes when pear-shaped weights or packed-boxes are scarce. It is\r\na very small matter to supply a school with light dumb-bells, when they\r\ncost but five cents a pound, and when, if necessary to retrench, a\r\nquarter as many pairs of them as there are scholars will suffice. As\r\nwill be shown in a later chapter, there is a very wide variety of\r\nexercises which could be practised in a school-room, which do not need\r\none cent's worth of apparatus. They simply need to be known, and then\r\nfaithfully practised, and most gratifying results are sure. In large\r\ncities it would be well to have all the teachers instructed by a\r\ncompetent master in the various exercises which they could so readily\r\nteach in school, and which would prove so beneficial to the scholars.\r\nLondon is already ahead of us in this direction. _Harper's Weekly_ of\r\nFebruary 8th, 1879, says: \"The London School Board has appointed Miss\r\nLofving, at a salary of fifteen hundred dollars a year, as\r\nsuperintendent of 'physical education' in the girls' schools.\"\r\n\r\nA man like Dr. Sargent, of the Fifth Avenue Gymnasium, in New York, could\r\neasily, in a few half-hour lessons, instruct the two thousand or more\r\nteachers of the public schools of that city in the simpler, and yet very\r\nvaluable exercises. They would be then well qualified, in turn, to\r\ninstruct all the pupils, and to so grade their exercises as to adapt the\r\nwork to all. The ordinary gymnastic instructor, as years have shown, in\r\nmost of our gymnasiums, lets the pupil do about as he has a mind to. This\r\nwould be just about as effective as if the same rule was followed out in\r\nmental training. But men like Sargent, strict disciplinarians, trained\r\nphysicians, and practical gymnasts as well, are far too scarce among us,\r\nand his is a field which many of our young physicians might enter with\r\nprospects of doing very great good in the community in which they live.\r\n\r\nLet the school commissioners of each State look to this matter at once.\r\nLet them insist that each teacher shall forthwith obtain the knowledge\r\nrequisite to properly instruct and bring forward every pupil in his or\r\nher class. A knowledge should be had of the exact kind and amount of\r\nwork requisite for a class of a certain age. Let some suitable person or\r\npersons be appointed in the cities to supervise this branch of\r\neducation, and see that the teachers are thoroughly qualified. Let the\r\nscholar understand that his body can be trained exactly as well as his\r\nmind, and that the sound health of both is intimately connected with\r\nhaving it so trained. Let the school-hours be so arranged that ten\r\nminutes in the middle of the morning session, and again in the\r\nafternoon, shall be allotted to this branch. See what Maclaren[F] did\r\nfor the Radley and Magdalen boys in _one hour a week!_ see what\r\nSargent[G] did in our country for two hundred youth in two hours a week,\r\nand with wooden dumb-bells, very light clubs, and a few pulley-weights\r\nat that! Let people at once and forever get rid of the notion that this\r\nexercise is a mere play-spell, or that it is only good to make athletes\r\nor acrobats. It is as much a branch of education as any taught in our\r\nschools to-day; and who will question that, if such uniform and splendid\r\nprogress was made in each school as was made in the cases just cited,\r\nand in different instances, with at first such unpromising pupils, the\r\nbrief twenty minutes daily so spent would be as well spent and as\r\nvaluable to each pupil as any other twenty or thirty minutes of his day?\r\nIt should no more be allowed to interfere with their usual play than any\r\nother branch is. It is a matter of progress and development, in a way\r\nhighly important to every scholar, and should be so treated, and the\r\nchild's play-hours should be in no way curtailed to accomplish it.\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Philbrick, of the Boston schools, is a man of long\r\nexperience in most matters connected with schools, their management, and\r\nwants. This gentlemen has lately received, at the Paris Exposition, high\r\nhonor for his accomplishments in this direction. But are the schools of\r\nBoston to-day taking the care they ought to and could so easily take to\r\nmake the children healthy and vigorous? Let Mr. Philbrick set about\r\nintroducing into every public school in that city such a system of\r\nphysical education as shall effect, for example, simply what Maclaren\r\neffected, what Sargent effected and is now effecting, and no more. Let\r\nhim stick to his task as persistently, if need be, as Stanley stayed at\r\nhis infinitely harder one, until every boy or girl who is graduated from\r\na Boston school has a strong, shapely, and healthy body, and knows what\r\ndid much to make it so, and what will keep it so. Then the east wind may\r\nblow over that good city, even until no gilding remains on the\r\nState-house dome, and the formerly weak throats and lungs will not mind\r\nit any more than they do the gentlest southern zephyr; Mr. Philbrick can\r\nfeel, when he looks over his life's work, that he has accomplished a\r\nthing for the scholars of his charge, and introduced a public benefit,\r\nwhich will redound to his credit as long as the city stands. There is no\r\nmore need of Americans having poor legs than Englishmen. There is no\r\nmore need of a boy's chest remaining a slim and half-built affair at the\r\nBrimmer School, or the Boston Latin School, than there was at Radley.\r\n\r\nWhen the good work is commenced, when other cities begin to send their\r\ndelegates and committees to watch methods, progress, and results, to\r\ntake steps to secure the same benefits for their own schools, then the\r\nadmirable example Boston has set in leading off in this direction will\r\nbe better understood. Then all will wonder why so simple, so sensible,\r\nso effective a course, conducive to present and future health and\r\nwell-being, had not been thought of and been carried out long ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[F] See page 140.\r\n\r\n[G] See pages 291, 292.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nWHAT A GYMNASIUM MIGHT BE AND DO.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew colleges of any pretension have not some sort of a\r\ngymnasium--indeed, hold it out to parents as one of the attractions.\r\nThere is a building, and it has apparatus in it. The former often costs\r\ntwice as much as needs be; the latter may be well made, and well suited\r\nto its purpose, or may not--in fact, more frequently is not. Instead of\r\nhaving apparatus graded, so as to have some for the slim and weak, some\r\nfor the stout and broad, too often one pair of parallel bars or one size\r\nof rowing-weight must suffice for all. Frequently the apparatus getting\r\nloose, or worn, or out of repair, remains so. The director is little\r\nmore than a janitor, and is so regarded. In many instances he does so\r\nlittle as to render this opinion a just one. Imperfect ventilation, and\r\nin winter lack of proper warmth, help to make it unattractive. The\r\nnewly-arrived Freshman is generally run down and thin from overwork in\r\npreparing himself for college. Many a time, when much work was telling\r\non him, he consoled himself with the thought that in the\r\ncollege-gymnasium, with his fellow-students about him all eagerly at\r\nwork, he would soon pick up the strength he had lost, and perhaps come\r\nto be, in time, as strong as this or that fellow, a few years his\r\nsenior, the fame of whose athletic exploits was more than local.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the American student is not very strong on entering college.\r\nPresident Eliot, of Harvard, said, a few years ago, of a majority of\r\nthose coming into that university, for instance, that they had\r\n\"undeveloped muscles, a bad carriage, and an impaired digestion, without\r\nskill in out-of-door games, and unable to ride, row, swim, or shoot.\"\r\n\r\nThe student is usually inerect, and really needs \"setting up\" quite as\r\nmuch as the newly-arrived \"pleb\" at West Point. But does he get it? No.\r\nIf coming from good stock, stronger than the average, and it happens to\r\nbe a year when there is much interest in athletics, the rowing-men or\r\nthe base-ball or foot-ball fellows will be after him. If they capture\r\nhim, he will get plenty of work--more than enough--but in one single\r\nrut. If he knows something of the allurements of these sports, and\r\ndesires to steer clear of them and be a reading man, still not to\r\nneglect his body, he is at a loss how to go to work. He finds a house\r\nfull of apparatus, and does not know how to use it. He sees the boating\r\nand ball men hard at it, but on their hobbies, and looks about for\r\nsomething else to do. He finds no other class of fellows working with\r\nany vim, save those eager to show well as gymnasts. He falls in with\r\nthese, takes nearly as much work the first day as they do, which is ten\r\ntimes too much for him, quite out of condition as he is. He becomes sore\r\nall over for two or three days, has no special ambition, after all, to\r\nbe a gymnast, and, ten to one, throws up the whole business disgusted.\r\n\r\nIn the warmer months even the oarsmen and ball-players work out-of-doors,\r\nand, except a little brush by the new-comers during the first month or so,\r\nhe finds the place deserted. At the start there was nobody to receive him,\r\nplace him, and to encourage and invite him on. If naturally persistent,\r\nand he sticks to it awhile, he gropes about in a desultory way, now trying\r\nthis and now that, until, neither increasing in size nor strength so fast\r\nas he had expected, he prefers to spend his spare hours in more attractive\r\nfields, and so drops the gymnasium, as many have done before him.\r\n\r\nHe has no more given it a fair trial than he would have his chemistry\r\nhad he treated it in the same way. It is not his fault, for he knew no\r\nbetter. The whole method of bringing up most American boys does almost\r\nnothing to fit the average boy for even the simpler work of the\r\ngymnasium, let alone its more advanced steps. Often, in the university\r\ngymnasium, you will see fellows actually so weak in the arms that they\r\ncan hardly get up in the parallel bars and rest their weight on their\r\nhands alone, much less go through them clear to the other end. It is a\r\npretty suggestive commentary on the way these establishments are\r\nconducted that the men so lamentably deficient are by no means all from\r\nthe new-comers, but often those who have nearly completed their course.\r\n\r\nYet here is a school which, rightly used, would do the average\r\nstudent more good, and would fit him better for his life's duties,\r\nthan any other one branch in the whole curriculum.\r\n\r\nBut a few years since a son of a lawyer of national reputation, a\r\nhighly gifted youth, made a most brilliant record at one of our best\r\nknown colleges. All who knew him conceded him a distinguished future;\r\nand yet he was hardly well out of college when he took away his life.\r\nHad there been a reasonable, sensible allowance of daily muscular work,\r\nhad the overtaxed brain been let rest awhile, and vigor cultivated in\r\nother directions, the rank, the general average, might have been a\r\ntrifle lower, but a most efficient man saved for a long and honorable\r\nlife. And yet every college has men who are practically following this\r\none's plan, overworking their brains, cutting off both ends of the\r\nnight, forcing their mental pace, till even the casual observer sees\r\nthat they cannot stand it long, and must break down before their real\r\nlife's race is well begun. Now, however exceptional may be the talents\r\nsuch a man has, does not his course show either dense ignorance of how\r\nto take care of himself, or a lack of something which would be worth\r\nfar more than brilliant talents--namely, common-sense?\r\n\r\nOught there not to be some department in a college designed to bring\r\nround mental development, where the authorities would step in and\r\nprevent this suicidal course? Oh, but there are such and such lectures\r\non health. Yes, and in most instances you might as well try and teach a\r\nboy to write by merely talking to him, taking care all the time that he\r\nhave no pen or pencil in his hand. It is a matter of surprise that\r\ncollege faculties are not more alive to the defects of the gymnasium\r\nconducted right under their very eyes. In every other branch they\r\nrequire a definite and specific progress during a given time, an ability\r\nto pass successfully periodical examinations which shall show that\r\nprogress, and, if the pupil fails, it tells on his general standing, and\r\nis an element which determines whether he is to remain in college.\r\n\r\nBut in the gymnasium there is nothing of the sort, and in many cases the\r\nyoung man need not step into it once during the four years unless he\r\nlikes. This state of things is partly accounted for by the fact that too\r\nmany of the professors in our colleges do not know anything about a\r\ngymnasium, and what it can do for a man. Indeed, often, if from practical\r\nexperience they were better up in this knowledge, it would beneficially\r\naffect the reputation of their college as a live institution.\r\n\r\nNor is the director, with very few exceptions, the right sort of man for\r\nhis place. Either the faculty have no conception what they do need here,\r\nor they effectually drive off the man they ought to have by starving\r\nhim. Professors' salaries are generally small enough, but the director\r\nof the gymnasium seldom gets half so much as the poorest paid of his\r\nbrother professors. Indeed, the latter do not regard him as an equal at\r\nall, and until they do so with good reason, there is little prospect of\r\nimprovement in this direction. A doctor as ill up to his work as the\r\naverage college gymnasium director would soon be without a patient.\r\n\r\nNor are the gymnasiums of our cities and towns much better off. New York\r\ncity to-day, with one or two exceptions, is utterly without a gymnasium\r\nworthy of her. Two of the best known are situated, one far below the\r\nstreet level, the other directly over a stable, and formerly at least, if\r\nnot still, a very redolent stable at that. There is generally plenty of\r\napparatus, most of which is good enough; but the boy or man who comes to\r\nuse it finds at once the same things wanting as does the student in the\r\ncollege gymnasium. If he can already raise a heavy dumb-bell over his head\r\nwith his right hand, he may, and often does, go on increasing his power in\r\nthis single direction, but in years actually gains little or no size or\r\nstrength in his other arm, his legs, or any other part of his body. No one\r\nstops him, or even gives him an idea of the folly of his course; indeed,\r\nno one has the power to do so. Ordinarily the place is kept by a man\r\nsimply to make a living. This secured, his ambition dies. He may be a\r\nboxer or an acrobat, or even a fair general gymnast. With one or two\r\nexceptions, we have yet to hear of an instance where the instructor has\r\neither devised a plan of class exercise which has proved attractive, or in\r\na given time has brought about a decided increase in size and strength to\r\na majority of his pupils in a specific and needed direction.\r\n\r\nCollege rowing and base-ball, while often unquestionably benefiting those\r\nwho took part in them, have been found to work detrimentally, but in a\r\nway, as will be shown in a moment, certainly not expected by the public.\r\nThe colleges in this country which pay most attention to rowing are\r\nHarvard, Yale, Cornell, and Columbia. It is well known that in both Oxford\r\nand Cambridge universities the men who row are numbered by hundreds; that\r\nover twenty eight-oared crews alone, to say nothing of other classes, are\r\nsometimes on the river at once, and that the problem for the \"'Varsity\"\r\ncaptain is not, as here, to find eight men all fitted for places in the\r\nboat, but, out of many fit, to tell which to take. For years the American\r\npress has reported the performances of our student oarsmen even oftener\r\nand more fully than the English non-sporting papers those of their own\r\noarsmen, so that they have filled a larger space in the public eye. Men\r\nnaturally thought that the interest among the students themselves was\r\nwell-nigh universal, and many fathers expressed misgivings about sending\r\nsons to institutions where the regular curriculum seemed a secondary\r\nmatter, and performance in athletic contests the chief thing.\r\n\r\nYet, strange as it may seem, this whole idea is an egregious mistake. Most\r\nof the students do take some interest in these contests, but it goes no\r\nfarther than talking somewhat about them, and viewing them when they come\r\noff, and perhaps betting the amount of their term-bills on them. The\r\nnumber who actually take part, either in the racing or the ball matches,\r\nor in trying for a chance in them, is ridiculously small. Dr. Sargent\r\nsays that at Yale College, where he has been for six years instructor in\r\nphysical culture, they actually do not exceed three per cent. of the whole\r\nnumber of students, while five per cent. will include every man in college\r\nwho takes active work at the gymnasium, on the river, or the ball-field!\r\nAny one familiar with American college athletics knows that the proportion\r\nof students who either play ball or row is probably, taking year and year\r\ntogether, about as great at Yale as anywhere in the country.\r\n\r\nSurprising as these figures are, they prove conclusively that the present\r\nsystem of college athletics, so far as it assumes to benefit the students\r\nat large, or even a tithe of them, is an utter failure. Here, then,\r\ninstead of the supposed advance in the general physical culture over that\r\nof years ago, there has been almost no advance. There are a few men who\r\ndevote much time and attention to severe athletics, more than there is any\r\nneed of, and become skilled and famous at them, but the great majority do\r\nlittle or nothing. Better ideas they doubtless have of what is and what is\r\nnot creditable performance among the athletes, and also as to the progress\r\nthat can be made in muscular development by direct and steady work. But\r\nthat progress and that work they have no share in.\r\n\r\nThe very natural result follows, that the great majority of students, at\r\ngraduation, average no better in size, strength, health, vigor, endurance,\r\nor stamina than those of a generation ago, or are any fitter to stand\r\nsuccessfully the wear and tear of their life's work. Indeed, it is very\r\ndoubtful if they are physically as well fitted for what is before them as\r\nthe previous generation were, for in the latter case probably more came\r\nfrom farms and homes where much manual labor was necessary, while now a\r\ngreater fraction are from the cities, or are the sons of parents whose\r\noccupation is mainly sedentary. Yet in that day gymnasiums at the\r\ncolleges were almost unknown, while now they are general.\r\n\r\nDoes the gymnasium, then, pay? Yes, like a bath-tub--if used,\r\nand used sensibly; but if not, not. Then, as it is used so\r\nlittle, is it worth having?\r\n\r\nAt Harvard, for instance, to-day there is in process of erection, at\r\ngreat expense, a gymnasium which, when finished, will doubtless be the\r\nmost costly building of the sort in this country, and very possibly the\r\nbest appointed as well. But unless there is introduced some sensible and\r\nvigorous system of bringing the students regularly there, and working\r\nthem while they are there, it will almost surely prove a failure, and\r\naccomplish little or no more good than did the old one. Now, suppose,\r\nfirst that this new institution is to be carried on with no more vigor\r\nor good sense than its predecessors. Next, suppose that, opposite this\r\nexpensive affair, on some neighboring field, there were built a\r\ncommodious shed, costing perhaps one-tenth as much as its more\r\npretentious rival, strongly framed, weather-tight, sensibly arranged,\r\nwell lit, and comfortably warmed, large enough, too, to admit, at the\r\nedge of the main room, of a running track of say twenty laps to the mile.\r\nIn an L adjoining let there be ample and well-ventilated dressing-rooms,\r\na locker for each student, and sufficient washing facilities to meet the\r\ndemand. Suppose the ordinary sorts of apparatus were there, but made with\r\ngreat care, and of the proportions skilled gymnasts have found most\r\nsuitable. Let there be, besides, all newly-invented appliances which have\r\nproved valuable, such as the twenty or more Dr. Sargent has introduced,\r\nand any other good ones as well. Suppose, too, that heavy weights for\r\nlifting, and all heavy clubs and dumb-bells, were carefully excluded.\r\n\r\nOn the walls there should be casts and drawings, showing\r\nwell-proportioned and well-developed arms, legs, and trunks, and a brief\r\nstatement with each of the various measurements and proportions, and the\r\nages of the men from whom they were taken, and, if possible, the sort and\r\namount of work done by each in their progress. These need by no means be\r\nall modern. Greece and Rome, Troy and Pompeii, could furnish their quota.\r\n\r\nSuppose the director at once, on the joining of a pupil, recorded, on a\r\npage set apart specially in his register, the age, height, general\r\nphysical characteristics, weight, girth of calf, thigh, hips, waist,\r\nlower chest, upper chest--both at rest and inflated--neck, upper\r\narm--extended and drawn up--and the forearm, hand, and wrist, taking\r\ncare to note the time of day the measurements were made, and also\r\nobtaining a photograph of the man as he then appeared in exercising\r\ncostume. Suppose that, outside of the ordinary requirements as to\r\nmethod, decorum, order of using apparatus, and so on, the director\r\nrefused to take any pupil who would not expressly agree to two things:\r\nfirst, to be at the gymnasium, stripped and ready for work, exactly at\r\nsuch a moment, four days out of the seven; second, to obey implicitly\r\nthe director's orders, both as to what work he should do, and what omit.\r\n\r\nSuppose the director's training had been such that he could tell at\r\nonce, both from the looks and measurements of the man, where he was\r\nphysically lacking, and that he so arranged his classes that all whose\r\nleft hands were weaker than their right had left-handed work only until\r\nthey were equalized up; that weak thighs, calves, abdominal muscles,\r\nchests, and backs had special work given them, bringing the desired\r\nparts directly into play, lightly as each needed at first, and then\r\ngradually working upward, the stronger parts, meanwhile, being at\r\nrest. Suppose this were continued until, at the end of the year,\r\nor often long before it, it is found that one arm is now as strong\r\nas the other, that the gain in girth at almost every measurement is\r\nnearly or all of an inch, and at some even two or more inches.\r\n\r\nSuppose a series of exercises, aimed directly to enlarge and strengthen\r\nthe respiratory power, were given to all, and every one, also, had a few\r\nminutes each day of \"setting up,\" and other work aimed not so much to\r\nadd size and strength as to make the crooked straight, to point out and\r\ninsist on a proper carriage of the head, the neck, the shoulders, the\r\narms, the whole trunk, and the knees, and to show each pupil what length\r\nof step best suited him, and which he ought to take.\r\n\r\nSuppose that the director showed at once that he not only knew\r\nwhat to do all through, but how to do it, and so promptly won\r\nthe confidence of those he sought to instruct and benefit.\r\n\r\nIs there any question in which of these two institutions the young man\r\nwould make the most desirable progress? The first building and\r\napparatus might be grand, fitted up with nearly all that could be\r\ndesired, but the gymnasium lacked a masterhead who should show its\r\npossibilities. Gymnasium and apparatus were like an engine without\r\nsteam. The second building was not of much account as a building, but\r\nquite all that was needed for the real end in view. The London\r\nRowing-club boat-houses were for a long time mere sheds, not to be\r\nnamed in the same day with the tasteful stone boat-houses along the\r\nSchuylkill, for instance; but those same plain sheds have for many\r\nyears turned out amateur oarsmen who could row down any in the world.\r\n\r\nAnd what a benefit a gymnasium conducted on some plan similar to that above\r\nsuggested would be to any college or university! And yet almost any\r\ncollege, even of limited means, could afford it. Change the plan a little,\r\nand make the attendance by all students just as it is in other\r\nbranches--just as it is at West Point in horseback practice--compulsory.\r\nGive the director a salary adequate to secure a first-class man in his\r\ncalling--not merely an accomplished gymnast, acrobat, boxer, or fencer, but\r\nan educated physician, the peer of any of his brother-members of the\r\nfaculty, fond of his calling, fond of the field before him, thoroughly\r\nacquainted with the plainer kinds of gymnastics and of acrobatic work, and\r\na good boxer, an instructor especially quick in detecting the physical\r\ndefects in his pupil, in knowing what exercise will cure them, zealous in\r\ninteresting him, in encouraging him on, what incalculable good he could do!\r\nEvery student in that college would practically have to be made over. Long\r\nbefore the four years, or even one of them, were through, that instructor\r\nwould have made all the men erect (as is daily being done with the West\r\nPointer). But his pupils, instead of being like the latter, developed\r\nsimply in those muscles which his business called into play, would each be\r\nwell developed all over, would each be up to what a well-built man of his\r\nyears and size ought to be in the way of strength, and skill, and staying\r\npowers, and--a most important thing--would know what he could do, and what\r\nhe could not; and so would not, as is now every day the case with many,\r\nattempt physical efforts long before he was fitted for them.\r\n\r\nIf he wanted to go into racing, the director would be his best friend,\r\nand would point out to him that the only safe way to get one's heart and\r\nlungs used to the violent action which they must undergo in racing,\r\nespecially after the racer gets tired, would be by gradually increasing\r\nhis speed from slow up to the desired pace, instead of, as too often\r\nhappens, getting up to racing pace before he is half fit for it.\r\n\r\nBut he would also show him how one-sided it would make him, developing\r\nsome parts, and letting others remain idle and fall behind in development,\r\nand--more important still--how brief and ephemeral was the fame which he\r\nwas working for, and the risks of overdoing which it entailed.\r\n\r\nLet one college in this land graduate each year a class of which every man\r\nhas an erect carriage and mien, has the legs and arms, the back and chest,\r\nnot of a Hercules, not of a prize racer or fighter, but of a hale, comely,\r\nstrong, and well-proportioned man, and see how well it would pay. Bear in\r\nmind that an hour a day put in in the right way and at the right work will\r\neffect all this in far less time than four years of trying. The\r\nhardest-reading man can readily spare the time for it, especially if he\r\nmust. What! would it take him from the thin, cadaverous fellow he too\r\noften is, and do all that for him? Beyond all doubt it would. Such\r\nvigorous work would soon sharpen his appetite, and he would find that, eat\r\nall he liked, he could digest it promptly, and would feel all the better\r\nfor his generous living. The generous living has fed muscles now\r\nvigorously used; they have been enlarged and strengthened: the legs, which\r\nnever used to try to jump a cubit high, even, once in the whole year, now\r\ncarry their owner safely over a four-rail fence, and perhaps another rail,\r\nor even two of them. The lungs, which were scarcely half expanded, now\r\nhave every air-cell thoroughly filled for at least one entire hour\r\ndaily--an excellent thing for weak lungs. Correct positions of standing,\r\nsitting, walking, and running being now well known and understood, the\r\nlungs get more air into them than formerly, even when their owner is at\r\nrest. Another effect of it all is shown in a decidedly more vigorous\r\ncirculation, and the consequent exhilaration and buoyancy of spirits, no\r\nmatter whether the work in hand is mental or physical.\r\n\r\nBut will not this hour's work dull him mentally? It may be proper to\r\ndigress for a moment and see if it will. Of men who have done just this\r\nkind and amount of work, this work aimed at every part of the body, we\r\nfind no record, simply because, as we have already shown, considerable\r\nas the increased interest is in physical culture and development, this\r\nplan of reaching all the parts and being just to all, has scarcely been\r\ntried. But abundant proof that some physical exercise will not dull the\r\nman, but even brighten him, can be had without difficulty. A moment's\r\nreflection will show that a mind ever on the stretch must, like a\r\nbow so kept, be the worse for it, and that the strain must be\r\noccasionally slacked. There are two ways of slacking it. Both the\r\nphysician and experience tell us that nothing rests a tired brain like\r\nsensible, physical exercise, except, of course, sleep.\r\n\r\n\"When in active use,\" says Mitchell, \"the thinking organs become full of\r\nblood, and, as Dr. Lombard has shown, rise in temperature, while the\r\nfeet and hands become cold. Nature meant that for their work they should\r\nbe, in the first place, supplied with food; next, that they should have\r\ncertain intervals of rest to rid themselves of the excess of blood\r\naccumulated during their periods of activity; and this is to be done by\r\nsleep, and also by bringing into play the physical machinery of the\r\nbody, such as the muscles--that is to say, by exercise which flushes the\r\nparts engaged in it, and so depletes the brain.\"[H]\r\n\r\nHere, then, some physical exercise will rest his brain, and fit it for\r\nmore and better work. But this does not necessarily imply so much as is\r\ncalled for in the hour. Happily, however, there is no lack of instances\r\nwhere work, quite as vigorous, though not as well directed, has\r\naccompanied mental work of a very high order, and to all appearances\r\nhas been a help rather than a hinderance. Instead of one hour a day,\r\nNapoleon for years was in the saddle several hours almost daily, but we\r\nnever heard that it clogged his mind. Charles O'Conor, always fond of\r\nlong walks, is good at them to-day, and noticeably erect and quick of\r\nmovement, though for weeks he once lay at death's door, and though he\r\nwas born in 1804. James Russell Lowell, sturdy, broad, and ruddy, is\r\nsaid to never ride when he can walk, and he is nearly sixty.\r\nGladstone's reputation as an axeman among the Hawarden oaks has reached\r\nour shores. Indeed, it is doubtful if there are many better _fellers_\r\nof his age in Europe, and he was born in 1809. Mr. M.H. Beebee, the\r\npresent senior tutor at Cambridge University in England, who rowed at\r\nnumber two in the \"'Varsity\" eight against Oxford in '65, not only\r\ntook the very highest university honor--a double-first--but a\r\nmuch higher double-first than even Gladstone had taken years before.\r\nThe fencing, duelling, and hard riding of Bismarck's youth do not\r\nseem to have perceptibly dimmed his intellect, or to have unfitted\r\nit for enormous and very important work in later life.\r\n\r\nAnd while the in-door work equalizes the strength, and takes care of the\r\narms and chest, the hour's \"constitutional\" daily out-of-doors has an\r\nespecial advantage, in that it insures at least that much out-of-door\r\nlife and air. Dr. Mitchell says, \"When exposure to out-of-door air is\r\nassociated with a fair share of physical exertion, it is an immense\r\nsafeguard against the ills of anxiety and too much brain-work. I presume\r\nthat very few of our generals could have gone through with their\r\nterrible task if it had not been that they lived in the open air and\r\nexercised freely. For these reasons I do not doubt that the effects\r\nof our great contest were far more severely felt by the Secretary of\r\nWar and the late President than by Grant or Sherman.\"\r\n\r\nA recent, interesting, and wonderfully apt instance, more so than any\r\nof these, one going straight to the point, and as nearly as possible\r\nthe equivalent of what we propose to urge later on all sedentary\r\nmen, one where the proof comes directly from the gentleman's own pen,\r\nis that of the late Mr. Bryant, whose letter on the subject, written\r\nto a friend in 1871, will be found on page 169. With characteristic\r\nsturdiness, with no one to aid or guide him, he hit on a plan of work\r\nto be done, partly in his little home-gymnasium, and partly on the road,\r\nand stuck faithfully to it till well over fourscore, and at eighty-two\r\nhe told the writer that he continued his exercise simply because it paid.\r\nHis aim was to keep all his machinery in working order, and to prolong\r\nhis life; and when he did die, at eighty-four, it was not from old age,\r\nnot because his functions were worn out. With his usual vigor and energy\r\nwhen any writing was to be done, he had thrown himself into his work of\r\npreparing his address at the Mazzini celebration, till, tired and\r\nexhausted, the undue exposure to the hot sun and the resulting fall were\r\ntoo much for him, and these were what took him away.\r\n\r\nBut the plan here suggested will not only cover all he did, but more.\r\nBryant does not seem to have cared for erectness, nor for a harmonious\r\ndevelopment of all the muscles. But had the amount of work he took been\r\nso directed, he might in youth have attained that harmony, and\r\nmaintained it through life, as Vanderbilt maintained his erectness.\r\n\r\nThere need be little fear, then, that a right use of the gymnasium will\r\noverdo. No better safeguard against that could be had than a wise\r\ndirector, familiar with the capacities of his pupil, watching him daily,\r\ninstilling sound principles, and giving him the very work he needs. Under\r\nsuch a tutor a young man who went to college, on receiving his degree,\r\nwould, if his moral and mental duties were attended to, be graduated, not\r\nwith an educated mind alone, but an educated body as well; not with merely\r\na bright head, and a body and legs like a pair of tongs. If the history of\r\nbrave, independent, earnest, pure men goes for anything, it will be found\r\nthat as the body was healthy and strong, it has in many a pass in life\r\ndirectly aided moral culture and strength, and has kept the man from\r\ndefiling that body which was meant to be kept sacred.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[H] \"Wear and Tear,\" p. 54.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nSOME RESULTS OF BRIEF SYSTEMATIC EXERCISE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a country like ours, where the masses are so intelligent, where so\r\nmuch care is taken to secure what is called a good education, the\r\nignorance as to what can be done to the body by a little systematic\r\nphysical education is simply marvellous. Few persons seem to be aware\r\nthat any limb, or any part of it, can be developed from a state of\r\nweakness and deficiency to one of fulness, strength, and beauty, and\r\nthat equal attention to all the limbs, and to the body as well, will\r\nwork like result throughout. A man spends three or four weeks at the hay\r\nand grain harvest, and is surprised at the increased grip of his hands,\r\nand the new power of arm and back. He tramps through forests, and\r\npaddles up streams and lakes after game, and returns wondering how three\r\nor four miles on a level sidewalk could ever have tired him.\r\n\r\nAn acquaintance of ours, an active and skilled journalist, says that he\r\nonce set out to saw twenty cords of wood, he was a slight, weak youth.\r\nHe found he had not enough strength or wind to get through one cut of\r\na log--that he had to constantly sit down and rest. People laughed at\r\nhim, and at his thinking he could go through that mighty pile. But they\r\ndid not know what was in him; for, sticking gamely to his self-imposed\r\ntask, he says that in a very few days he found his stay improving\r\nrapidly, that he did not tire half so easily, and, more than that, that\r\nthere began to come a feeling over him--a most welcome one--of new\r\nstrength in his arms and across his chest; and that what had at first\r\nlooked almost an impossibility had now become very possible, and was\r\nbefore long accomplished. Now, what he, by his manliness, found was\r\nfast doing so much for his arms and chest, was but a sample of what\r\nequally steady, systematic work might have done for his whole body.\r\nIndeed, a later experience of this same gentleman will be in place\r\nhere; for at Dr. Sargent's gymnasium in New York, in the winter of\r\n1878-'79, he, though a middle-aged man, increased the girth of his\r\nchest _two inches and five-eighths in six weeks_! and this working but\r\none hour a day; and he found that he could not only do more work daily\r\nafterward at his profession, but better work as well.\r\n\r\nThe youth who works daily in a given line at the gymnasium as much expects\r\nthat, before the year is over, not only will the muscles used decidedly\r\nincrease in strength, but in size and shapeliness as well, as he does that\r\nthe year's reading will improve his mind, or a year's labor bring him his\r\nsalary. It is an every-day expression with him that such a fellow \"got his\r\narm up to\" fifteen, or his chest to forty-odd inches, and so on. He sees\r\nnothing singular in this. He knows this one, who in a short time put half\r\nan inch on his forearm, or an inch; that one, whose thigh, or chest, or\r\nwaist, or calf made equal progress. Group and classify these gains in many\r\ncases, and note the amount of work and the time taken in each, and soon one\r\ncan tell pretty well what can be done in this direction. Few of our\r\ngymnasiums are so kept that their records will aid much in this inquiry,\r\nsimply because the instructor either has no conception of the field before\r\nhim, or, if he has, for some reason fails to improve the opportunity.\r\n\r\nLook at what Maclaren effected (as described by him in his admirable\r\n\"Physical Education\"), not with here and there an isolated case, but\r\nwith both boys and men turned in on him by the hundred, and in all\r\nstages of imperfect development! Take it first among the boys. Under\r\nsystematic exercise, W----, a boy at Radley College, ten years old in\r\nJune, 1861, had, seven years later, increased in height from 4 feet\r\n6-3/4 inches to 5 feet 10-3/4 inches, or a gain of 16 inches in all; in\r\nweight from 66 pounds--light weight for a ten-year-old boy--to 156\r\npounds; far heavier than most boys at seventeen; showing an advance of\r\n90 pounds. His forearm went from 7-1/4 to 11-3/4 inches--very large for\r\na boy of seventeen, and decidedly above the average of that of most men;\r\nhis upper arm from 7-1/2 inches to 13-3/8--also far above the average at\r\nthat age; while his chest had actually increased in girth from 26\r\ninches--which was almost slender, even for a ten-year-old--to 39-1/2\r\ninches, which is all of two inches larger than the average man's.\r\n\r\nHis description of this boy was: \"Height above average; other measurements\r\naverage. From commencement, growth rapid, and sustained _with regular and\r\nuniform development_. The whole frame advancing to great physical power.\"\r\n\r\nAnother boy, H----, starting in June, 1860, when ten years old, 4 feet\r\n6-1/4 inches high, and weighing 73 pounds--much heavier than the other\r\nat the start--in eight years gained 13-1/2 inches, making him 5 feet\r\n7-3/4 inches--of medium height for that age. He gained 71 pounds in\r\nthe eight years, and at 144 pounds was better built than W---- at 156;\r\nfor, though his forearm, starting at 8 inches, had become 11-1/2, a\r\nquarter of an inch less than W----'s, yet his upper arm had gone\r\nfrom 8-3/4 to 13-1/2 inches, or one-eighth of an inch larger, while\r\nhis chest rose from 28-1/4 to 39 inches--within half an inch of\r\nthe other's, though the latter was 3 inches taller.\r\n\r\nHe is described: \"Height slightly above average; other measurements\r\nconsiderably above average. From commencement, _growth and\r\ndevelopment regular and continuous. The whole frame perfectly\r\ndeveloped for this period of life._\"\r\n\r\nS----'s case is far more remarkable. He was evidently very small and\r\nundersized. \"Height and all other measurements _greatly_ below average;\r\nthe whole frame stunted and dwarfish. Advancement at first slight, and\r\nvery irregular. Afterward rapid, and comparatively regular.\"\r\n\r\nHe only gained in height three-quarters of an inch from thirteen to\r\nfourteen, where W---- had gained 3-5/8 inches, and H---- 3-1/8 inches. Yet,\r\nfrom fifteen to sixteen, where W---- only went ahead half an inch, and\r\nH---- five-eighths of an inch, S---- actually gained 4 inches, which must\r\nhave been most gratifying. His weight changes were even more noticeable.\r\nFrom twelve to fifteen W---- gained 58 pounds, and H---- 39, while all\r\nS---- could show was 12. But from fifteen to sixteen see how he caught up!\r\nWhere W----made 11 pounds, and H---- 10, S---- made 22. Where W----'s chest\r\nwent up 1 inch, and H----'s 1-1/2 inches, S----'s went up 3 inches.\r\n\r\nNow, how long did these boys work? As Maclaren says \"_Just\r\none hour per week!_\"\r\n\r\nWhat parent believes that any hour in that week was better\r\nspent--better for the comfort, for the welfare of the boy, or\r\nbetter in fitting him for future usefulness--or what nearly so\r\nwell? Most boys waste that much time nearly every day.\r\n\r\nLook, too, at the benefit to the boy in all his after-life. Indeed, does\r\nnot this hour a week, in some instances, insure an after-life, and\r\nsnatch not a few from an early grave? Had every slim, thin-chested man\r\nin America, and every slim, thin-chested boy who never lived to be a\r\nman, spent an hour weekly under such tutoring, from the age of ten to\r\neighteen, would not the benefit to our land in working-power, in vigor\r\nand force, and comfort as well, have been incalculable? And had it,\r\ninstead of one hour a week, been two or three, or even an hour a day,\r\nmight not the results have been even more gratifying?\r\n\r\nProfessor Maclaren may well congratulate himself on such good results\r\namong the boys. But what has he done with men? Some years ago twelve\r\nnon-commissioned officers, selected from all branches of the service, were\r\nsent to him to qualify as instructors for the British army. He says:\r\n\r\n\"They ranged between nineteen and twenty-nine years of age, between five\r\nfeet five inches and six feet in height, between nine stone two [128]\r\npounds and twelve stone six [174] pounds in weight, and had seen from\r\nten to twelve years' service.\"\r\n\r\nHe carefully registered the measurements of each at the start, and at\r\ndifferent times throughout their progress. He says:\r\n\r\n\"The muscular additions to the arms and shoulders, and the expansion of\r\nthe chest, were so great as to have absolutely a ludicrous and\r\nembarrassing result, for, before the fourth month, several of the men\r\ncould not get into their uniforms, jackets, and tunics, without\r\nassistance, and when they had got them on they could not get them to meet\r\ndown the middle by a hand's-breadth. In a month more they could not get\r\ninto them at all, and new clothing had to be procured, pending the arrival\r\nof which the men had to go to and from the gymnasium in their great-coats.\r\nOne of these men gained five inches in actual girth of chest.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he well adds: \"Now who shall tell the value of these five inches\r\nof chest, five inches of additional space for the heart and lungs\r\nto work in?\" Hardly five inches more of heart and lung room,\r\nthough part of the gain must have been of course from the enlargement\r\nof the muscles on the side of the chest.\r\n\r\nHe also hit upon another plan of showing the change; for he says\r\nhe had them \"photographed, stripped to the waist\", both at first\r\nand when the four months were over, and the change even in these\r\nportraits was very distinct, and most notably in the youngest, who\r\nwas nineteen, for, besides the acquisition of muscle, there was in\r\nhis case \"a readjustment and expansion of the osseous framework\r\nupon which the muscles are distributed.\" Now let us look a little\r\nat the measurements and the actual changes wrought.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, this last instance settles conclusively one matter\r\nmost important to flat-chested youth, namely, whether the shape of the\r\nchest itself can be changed; for here it was done, and in a very short\r\ntime at that. Again, of these twelve men, in less than eight months every\r\none gained perceptibly in height; indeed, there was an average gain of\r\nfive-twelfths of an inch in height, though all, save one, were over\r\ntwenty; and one man who gained half an inch was twenty-eight years old,\r\nwhile one twenty-six gained five-eighths of an inch! (Most people suppose\r\nthey can get no taller after twenty-one.) All increased decidedly in\r\nweight--the smallest gain being 5 pounds, the average 10 pounds; and one,\r\nand he twenty-eight, and a five-feet-eleven man, actually went up from\r\n149 pounds at the beginning, to 165 pounds in less than four months. It\r\nis not likely there was much fat about them, as they had so much vigorous\r\nmuscular exercise. Every man's chest enlarged decidedly, the smallest\r\ngain being a whole inch in the four months, the average being 2-7/8\r\ninches, and one, though twenty-four years old, actually gaining 5 inches,\r\nor over an inch a month. Every upper arm increased 1 inch, most of\r\nthem more than that, and one 1-3/4 inches. As the work was aimed to\r\ndevelop the whole body, there is little doubt that there was a\r\nproportional increase in the girth of hips and thigh and calf.\r\n\r\nAgain, from the Royal Academy at Woolwich, Professor Maclaren took\r\ntwenty-one youths whose average age was about eighteen, and in the\r\nbrief period of four months and a half obtained an average advance of\r\n1-3/4 pounds in weight, of 2-1/2 inches in chest, and of 1 inch on the\r\nupper arm; while one fellow, nineteen, and slender at that, gained 8\r\npounds in weight, and 5-1/4 inches about the chest! Think what a\r\ndifference that would make in the chest of any man, and a difference\r\nall in the right direction at that!\r\n\r\nBut the most satisfactory statistics offered were those of two\r\narticled pupils, one sixteen, the other twenty. In exactly one year's\r\nwork the younger grew from 5 feet 2-3/4 inches in height to 5 feet\r\n4-3/4 inches. He weighed 108 pounds on his sixteenth birthday; on his\r\nseventeenth, 129! At the start his chest girthed 31 inches; twelve\r\nmonths later, just 36! His forearm went up from 8 inches to 10\r\ninches, and his upper arm from 9-1/4 inches to 11-1/4.\r\n\r\nWhile the older gained but three-eighths of an inch in height, his weight\r\nwent up from 153 pounds to 161-1/2, his forearm from 11-1/4 inches to\r\n12-1/2--an unusually large forearm for any man--and his upper arm from\r\n11-3/4 inches to 13-1/4, while his chest actually made the astonishing\r\nstride of from 34 inches to 40. Not yet a large arm, save below the elbow,\r\nnot yet a great chest; five inches smaller, for instance, than Daniel\r\nWebster's, but greatly ahead of what they were a year earlier.\r\n\r\nThere is no mystery about the Maclaren method. Others might do\r\nit, perhaps not as well as he, for Maclaren's has been a very\r\nexceptional experience; still, well enough.\r\n\r\nLook what Sargent did with a Bowdoin student of nineteen, as shown in\r\nAppendix IV. In four hours' work a week this student's upper arm went up\r\n1-1/2 inches--just the same amount as did Maclaren's student of twenty;\r\nhis chest went up from 36-1/2 inches to 40, while that of Maclaren's man\r\nwent from 34 to 40; but it should be borne in mind that 36-1/2 is harder\r\nto add 6 inches to in this kind of work than 34. In height the Englishman\r\nmade three-eighths of an inch in the year, while the American made a\r\nwhole inch. But the latter also led easily in another direction, and a\r\nvery important one too; for, while the Briton, though but a year older,\r\nand of almost exactly the same height, gained but 8-1/2 pounds in\r\nthe year, the American made 15! His case is further valuable in\r\nthat it shows, beside this advance above the waist, splendid increase\r\nin girth of hips, thigh, and calf as well.\r\n\r\nWith us Americans fond of results, many of whose chests, by-the-way, do not\r\nincrease a hair's-breadth in twenty years, better proof could not be sought\r\nthan these figures offer of the value of a system of exercise which would\r\nwork such rapid and decided changes. Had they all been with boys, there\r\nmight have been difficulty in separating what natural growth did, in the\r\nyears they change so fast, from what was the result of development. But\r\nmost of the cases cited are of men who had their growth, and had\r\napparently, to a large extent, taken their form and set for life. To take a\r\nman twenty-eight years old, tall and rather slim, and whose height had\r\nprobably not increased a single hairs-breadth in seven years, and in a few\r\nshort months increase that height by a good half inch; to take another,\r\nalso twenty-eight, and suddenly, in the short period between September 11th\r\nand the 30th of the next April, add sixteen pounds to his weight, and every\r\npound of excellent stuff, was in itself no light thing; and there are\r\nthousands of men in our land to-day who would be delighted to make an\r\nequally great addition to their general size and strength, even in twice\r\nthe period. To add five whole inches of chest, and nearly that much of lung\r\nand heart room and stomach room, and the consequent greater capacity for\r\nall the vital organs, is a matter, to many men, of almost immeasurable\r\nvalue. Hear Dr. Morgan, in his English \"University Oars,\" on this point:\r\n\"An addition of three inches to the circumference of the chest implies that\r\nthe lungs, instead of containing 250 cubic inches of air, as they did\r\nbefore their functional activity was exalted, are now capable of receiving\r\n300 cubic inches within their cells: the value of this augmented lung\r\naccommodation will readily be admitted. Suppose, for example, that a man is\r\nattacked by inflammation of the lungs, by pleurisy, or some one of the\r\nvaried forms of consumption, it may readily be conceived that, in such an\r\nemergency, the possession of enough lung tissue to admit forty or fifty\r\nadditional cubic inches of air will amply suffice to turn the scale on the\r\nside of recovery. It assists a patient successfully to tide over the\r\ncritical stage of his disease.\" A man, then, of feeble lungs--the\r\nconsumptive, for instance--taken early in hand, with the care which\r\nMaclaren or Sargent could so well give, gradually advanced in every\r\ndirection, would suddenly find that his narrow, thin, and hollow chest had\r\ndeparted, had given way to one round, full, deep, and roomy; that the\r\nfeeble lungs and heart which, in cooler weather, were formerly hardly up to\r\nkeeping the extremities warm, are now strong and vigorous; that the old\r\ntendency to lean his head forward when standing or walking, and to sit\r\nstooping, with most of his vital organs cramped, has all gone. In their\r\nplace had come an erect carriage, a firm tread, a strong, well-knit trunk,\r\na manly voice, and a buoyancy and exhilaration of spirits worth untold\r\nwealth. Who will say that all these have not assured him years of life?\r\n\r\nWell, but did all this increase of weight and size actually change the\r\nshape of the chest, for instance, and take the hollowness out of it?\r\nThat is exactly what it did; and Maclaren has a drawing of the same\r\nchest at the beginning and end of the year, showing an increase in the\r\nbreadth, depth, and fulness of the lower chest which makes it seem\r\nalmost impossible that it could have belonged to the same person. It\r\nwill be remembered that Maclaren claimed[I] that just such a\r\nreadjustment of the osseous framework would result. Is not this, then,\r\nremaking a man? Instead of a cramped stomach, half-used lungs, a thin,\r\nscrawny, caved-in make, poor pipe-stems of legs, with arms to match,\r\nalmost every one under forty, at least, can in a very few months, by\r\nmeans of a series of exercises, change those same slender legs, those\r\npuny arms, that flat chest, that slim neck, and metamorphose their owner\r\ninto a well-built, self-sufficient, vigorous man, fitter a hundred times\r\nfor severe in-door or out-door life, for the quiet plodding at the desk,\r\nor the stormy days and nights of the ocean or the bivouac. Who is going\r\nto do better brain-work: he whose brain is steadily fed with vigorous,\r\nrich blood, made by machinery kept constantly in excellent order, never\r\ncramped, aided daily by judicious and vigorous exercise, tending\r\ndirectly to rest and build him up? or he who overworks his brain, gets\r\nit once clogged with blood, and, for many hours of the day, keeps it\r\nclogged, who does nothing to draw the blood out of his brain for awhile\r\nand put more of it in the muscles, who, perhaps, in the very midst of\r\nhis work, rushes out, dashes down a full meal, and hurries back to work,\r\nand at once sets his brain to doing well-nigh its utmost?\r\n\r\nWell, but is not the work which will effect such swift changes very\r\nsevere, and so a hazardous one to attempt? That is just what it is not.\r\nIs there anything very formidable in wooden dumb-bells weighing only\r\ntwo and a half pounds each, or clubs of three and a half-pounds, or\r\npulley-weights of from ten to fifteen pounds? or is any great danger\r\nlikely to result from their use? And yet they were Sargent's weapons\r\nwith his Bowdoin two hundred.[J] Nothing in Maclaren's work, so far as\r\nhe points out what it is, is nearly so dangerous as a sudden run to boat\r\nor train, taken by one all out of the way of running, perhaps who has\r\nnever learned. There a heart unused to swift work is suddenly forced to\r\nbeat at a tremendous rate, lungs ordinarily half-used are strained to\r\ntheir utmost, and all without one jot of preparation.\r\n\r\nBut here, by the most careful and judicious system, the result of long\r\nstudy and much practical application, a person is taken, and, by work\r\nexactly suited to his weak state, is gradually hardened and\r\nstrengthened. Then still more is given him to do, and so on, at the rate\r\nthat is plainly seen to best suit him. Develop every man's body by such\r\na method, teach every American school-boy the erect carriage of the West\r\nPointer, and how many men among us would there be built after the\r\npattern of the typical brother Jonathan, or of the thin-chested,\r\nround-shouldered, inerect, and generally weak make, so common in\r\nnearly every city, town, and village in our land?\r\n\r\nLook, too, at the knowledge such a course brings of the workings of\r\none's own body, of its general structure, of its possibilities! What a\r\nlecture on the human body it must prove, and how it must fit the man to\r\nkeep his strength up, and, if lost, to recover it; for it has uniformly\r\nbeen found that a man once strong needs but little work daily to keep\r\nhim so. A little reflection on facts like the foregoing must point\r\nstrongly to the conclusion that the body--at least of any one not yet\r\nmiddle-aged--admits of a variety and degree of culture almost as great\r\nas could be desired, certainly sufficient to make reasonably sure of a\r\ngreat accession of strength and health to a person formerly weak, and\r\nthat with but a little time given each day to the work.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[I] See page 145.\r\n\r\n[J] See Appendix II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nWORK FOR THE FLESHY, THE THIN, THE OLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the endeavor has been made to point out the value of plain and\r\nsimple exercise--for, in a later chapter, particular work will be\r\ndesignated which, if followed systematically and persistently, will\r\ncorrect many physical defects, substituting good working health and\r\nvigor for weakness--the reply may be made, \"Yes, these are well enough\r\nfor the young and active, but they will not avail a fleshy person,\r\nor a slim one, or one well up in years.\"\r\n\r\nLet us see about this. Take, first, those burdened with flesh which\r\nseems to do them little or no good, and which is often a hinderance,\r\ndulling and slackening their energies, preventing them from doing much\r\nwhich they could, and which they believe they would do with alacrity\r\nwere they once freed from this unwelcome burden. There are some persons\r\nwith whom the reduction of flesh becomes a necessity. They have a\r\ncertain physical task to perform, and they know they cannot have either\r\nthe strength or the wind to get through with it creditably, unless they\r\nfirst rid themselves of considerable superfluous flesh.\r\n\r\nTake the man, for instance, who wants to walk a race of several miles,\r\nor to run or row one. He has often heard of men getting their weight\r\ndown to a certain figure for a similar purpose. He has seen some one who\r\ndid it, and he is confident that he can do it. He sets about it, takes\r\nmuch and severe physical work daily, warmly clad, perspiring freely,\r\nwhile he subjects his skin to much friction from coarse towels. He does\r\nwithout certain food which he understands makes fat, and only eats that\r\nwhich he believes makes mainly bone and muscle. He sticks to his work,\r\nand gradually makes that work harder and faster. To his gratification,\r\nhe finds that not only has his wind improved, so that, in the place of\r\nthe old panting after a slight effort--walking briskly up an ordinary\r\nflight of stairs, for instance--he can now breathe as easily and\r\nquietly, and can stick to it as long, as any of his leaner companions.\r\nBy race-day he is down ten, fifteen, or twenty pounds, or even more, as\r\nthe case may be. While he has thus reduced himself, and is far stronger\r\nand more enduring than he was before, he is not the only one who has\r\nlost flesh, if there have been a number working with him, as in a\r\nboat-crew. Notice the lists of our university crews and their weights,\r\npublished when they commence strict training, say a month before the\r\nrace, and compare them with those of the same men on race-day,\r\nparticularly in hot weather. The reduction is very marked all through\r\nthe crew. In the English university eights it is even more striking, the\r\nlarge and stalwart fellows, who fill their thwarts, often coming down in\r\na month an average of over a dozen pounds per man.\r\n\r\nWe have seen a student, after weighing himself on scales in the\r\ngymnasium, sit down at a fifty-five pound rowing weight, pull\r\nforty-five full strokes a minute for twenty minutes, then, clad\r\nexactly as before, weigh again on the same scales, and find he was\r\njust one pound lighter than he was twenty minutes earlier.\r\n\r\nBut the difference is more marked in more matured men, who naturally run\r\nto flesh, than in students. A prize-fighter, for instance, in changing\r\nfrom a life of indulgence and immoderate drinking, will often come down\r\nas much as thirty, or even forty pounds, in preparing for his contest.\r\nIt should be remembered that, besides other advantages of his being\r\nthin, it is of great importance that his face should be so lean\r\nthat a blow on his cheek shall not puff it up, and swell it so as to\r\nshut up his eye, and put him at his enemy's mercy.\r\n\r\nBut most people do not care to take such severe and arduous work as\r\neither the amateur athlete or the prize-fighter. If they could hit on\r\nsome comparatively light and easy way of restoring themselves physically\r\nto a hard-muscle basis, and could so shake off their burden of flesh\r\nwithout interfering seriously with their business, they would be glad\r\nto try it. Let us see if this can be done.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1877 the writer met a gentleman of middle age, whom he\r\nhad known for years, and who has been long connected with one of the\r\nUnited States departments in New York city. A very steady, hard-working\r\nofficer, his occupation was a sedentary one. Remembering him as a man,\r\ntill recently, of immense bulk, and being struck with his evident and\r\ngreat shrinkage, we inquired if he had been ill. He replied that he had\r\nnot been ill, that for years he had not enjoyed better health.\r\nQuestioning him as to his altered appearance, he said that, on the\r\neighteenth day of January, 1877, he weighed three hundred and five\r\npounds; that, having become so unwieldy, his flesh was a source of great\r\nhinderance and annoyance to him. Then he had determined, if possible, to\r\nget rid of some of it. Having to be at work all day, he could only\r\neffect his purpose in the evenings, or not at all. So, making no\r\nespecial change in his diet, he took to walking, and soon began to\r\naverage from three to five miles an evening, and at the best pace he\r\ncould make. In the cold months he says that he often perspired so that\r\nsmall icicles would form on the ends of his hair. Asking if it did not\r\ncome a little stiff sometimes, on stormy nights or when he was very\r\ntired, and whether he did not omit his exercise at such times, he said\r\nno, but, on the contrary, added two miles, which shows the timber the\r\nman was made of. On the eighteenth of June of the same year, just five\r\nmonths from the start, he weighed but two hundred and fifteen pounds,\r\n_having actually taken off ninety pounds_, and had so altered that his\r\nformer clothes would not fit him at all. Since that time we have again\r\nseen him, and he says he is now down to two hundred, and that he has\r\ntaken to horseback-riding, as he is fond of that. He looks to-day a\r\nlarge, strong, hearty man of about five feet ten, of rather phlegmatic\r\ntemperament, but no one would ever think of him as a fat man.\r\n\r\nNow here is a man well known to hundreds of the lawyers of the\r\nNew York Bar, a living example of what a little energy and determination\r\nwill accomplish for a person who sets about his task as if he meant\r\nto perform it.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, M----, a member of the Boston Police force, known to the\r\nwriter, was said to weigh three hundred and fifteen pounds, and was\r\ncertainly an enormously large man. He went South, served for some time\r\nas stoker on a gunboat, and an intimate friend of his informed us that\r\nhe had reduced his weight to one hundred and eighty-four.\r\n\r\nA girl of fifteen or sixteen, and inclined to be fleshy, found that, by\r\na good deal of horseback-riding daily, she lost twenty-five pounds in\r\none year--so a physician familiar with her case informed us.\r\n\r\nBrisk walking, and being on the feet much of the day--as Americans,\r\nfor instance, find it necessary to do when they try to see the\r\nParisian galleries and many other of Europe's attractions all in a\r\nvery few weeks--will tell decidedly on the weight of fleshy people,\r\nand dispose them to move more quickly. When you can do it, this is\r\nperhaps not such a bad way to reduce yourself.\r\n\r\nNow, if so many have found that vigorous muscular exercise, taken daily and\r\nassiduously, accomplished the desired end for them, does it not look as if\r\na similar course, combined with a little strength of purpose, would bring\r\nsimilar benefit to others? In any case, such a course has this advantage:\r\nbegun easily, and followed up with gradually increasing vigor, it will be\r\nsure to tone up and strengthen one, and add to the spring and quickness of\r\nmovement, whether it reduces one's flesh or not. But it is a sort of work\r\nwhere free perspiration must be encouraged, not hindered, for this is\r\nplainly a prominent element in effecting the desired purpose.\r\n\r\nBut, while many of us know instances where fat people have, by exercise,\r\nbeen reduced to a normal weight, is it possible for a thin person to\r\nbecome stouter? A thin person may have a large frame or a slender one.\r\nIs there any work which will increase the weight of each, and bring\r\ndesirable roundness and plumpness of trunk and limb?\r\n\r\nTake, first, the slim man. Follow him for a day, or even an hour, and\r\nyou will usually find that, while often active--indeed, too\r\nactive--still he does no work which a person of his height need be\r\nreally strong to do. Put him beside such a person who is not merely\r\nlarge, but really strong and in equally good condition, and\r\ncorrespondingly skilful, and let the two train for an athletic feat of\r\nsome sort--row together, for instance, or some other work where each\r\nmust carry other weight in addition to his own. The first mile they can\r\ngo well together, and one will do about as much as the other. But as the\r\nsecond wears along, the good strength begins to tell; and the slim man,\r\nwhile, perhaps, sustaining his form pretty well, and going through the\r\nmotions, is not quite doing the work, and his friend is gradually\r\ndrawing away from him. At the third mile the disparity grows very\r\nmarked, and the stronger fellow has it all his own way, while at the\r\nend he also finds that he has not taken as much out of him as his\r\nslender rival. He has had more to carry, both in his boat's greater\r\nweight, and especially in his own, but his carrying power was more than\r\nenough to make up for the difference. Measure the slim man where you\r\nwill, about his arm or shoulders, chest or thigh or calf, and the other\r\noutmeasures him; the only girth where he is up, and perhaps ahead, is\r\nthat of his head--for thin fellows often have big heads. The muscles of\r\nthe stronger youth are larger as well as stronger.\r\n\r\nNow, take the slim fellow, and set him to making so many efforts a day with\r\nany given muscle or muscles, say those of his upper left arm, for instance.\r\nPut some reward before him which he would like greatly to have--say a\r\nhundred thousand dollars--if in one year from date he will increase the\r\ngirth of that same upper left arm two honest inches. Now, watch him, if he\r\nhas any spirit and stuff, as thin fellows very often have, and see what he\r\ndoes. Insist, too, that whatever he does shall in no way interfere with his\r\nbusiness or regular duties, whatever they may be, but that he must find\r\nother time for it. And what will he do? Why, he will leave no stone\r\nunturned to find just what work uses the muscles in question, and at that\r\nwork he will go, with a resolution which no obstacle will balk. He is\r\nsimply showing the truth of Emerson's broad rule, that \"in all human action\r\nthose faculties will be strong which are used;\" and of Maclaren's,\r\n\"Where the activity is, there will be the development.\"\r\n\r\nThe new work flushes the muscles in question with far more blood than\r\nbefore, while the wear and tear being greater, the call for new material\r\ncorresponds, and more and more hearty food is eaten and assimilated. The\r\nquarter-inch or more of gain the first fortnight often becomes the whole\r\ninch in less than two months, and long before the year is out the\r\ncoveted two inches have come. And, in acquiring them, his whole left\r\narm and shoulder have had correspondingly new strength added, quite\r\ngoing past his right, though it was the larger at first, if meanwhile\r\nhe has practically let it alone.\r\n\r\nThere are some men, either at the college or city gymnasiums, every\r\nyear, who are practically getting to themselves such an increase\r\nin the strength and size of some particular muscles.\r\n\r\nWe knew one at college who, on entering, stood hardly five feet four,\r\nweighed but about one hundred and fifteen pounds, and was small and\r\nrather spare. For four years he worked with great steadiness in the\r\ngymnasium, afoot and on the water, and he graduated a five-foot-eight\r\nman, splendidly built, and weighing a hundred and sixty-eight\r\npounds--every pound a good one, for he was one of the best bow-oarsmen\r\nhis university ever saw.\r\n\r\nAnother, tall and very slender, but with a large head and a very bright\r\nmind, was an habitual fault-finder at everything on the table, no matter\r\nif it was fit for a prince. A friend got him, for awhile, into a little\r\nathletic work--walking, running, and sparring--until he could trot three\r\nmiles fairly, and till one day he walked forty-five--pretty well used\r\nup, to be sure, but he walked it. Well, his appetite went up like a\r\nrocket. Where the daintiest food would not tempt him before, he would\r\nnow promptly hide a beefsteak weighing a clean pound at a meal, and that\r\nno matter if cooked in some roadside eating-house, where nothing was\r\nneat or tidy, and flies abounded almost as they did once in Egypt in\r\nPharaoh's day. His friends frequently spoke of his improved temper, and\r\nhow much easier it was to get on with him. But after a while his efforts\r\nslackened, and his poor stomach returned to its old vices, at least in\r\npart. Had he kept at what was doing so much for him, it would have\r\ncontinued to prove a many-sided blessing.\r\n\r\nIf steady and vigorous use of one set of muscles gradually increases\r\ntheir size, why should not a similar allowance, distributed to each, do\r\nthe same for all? See (Appendix V.) what it did in four months and\r\ntwelve days for Maclaren's pupil of nineteen, whose upper arm not only\r\ngained a whole inch and a half (think how that would add to the beauty\r\nalone of many a woman's arm, to say nothing of its strength), and whose\r\nchest enlarged five inches and a quarter, _but whose weight went up\r\neight pounds_! Or what it did (see Appendix IV.) for Sargent's pupil of\r\nnineteen, who in just one year, besides making an inch and a half of\r\nupper arm, and three and a half of chest, went up from a hundred and\r\nforty-five pounds to a hundred and sixty, or _a clean gain of fifteen\r\npounds_. Or (see Appendix VI.) for Maclaren's man, fully twenty-eight\r\nyears old, who, in seven months and nineteen days, made _sixteen\r\npounds_; or (Appendix VII.) for his youth of sixteen, who in just one\r\nyear increased his weight _full twenty-one pounds_!\r\n\r\nThese facts certainly show pretty clearly whether sensible bodily\r\nexercise, taken regularly, and aimed at the weak spots, will not tell,\r\nand tell pretty rapidly, on the thin man wanting to stouten, and tell,\r\ntoo, in the way he wants.\r\n\r\nIt will make one eat heartily, it will make him sleep hard and long.\r\nEvery ounce of the food is now digested, and the long sleep is just what\r\nhe needed. Indeed, if, after a hearty dinner, a man would daily take a\r\nnap, and later in the day enough hard work to make sure of being\r\nthoroughly tired when bedtime came, he would doubtless find the flesh\r\ncoming in a way to which he was a stranger. Many thin persons do not\r\nrest enough. They are constantly on the go, and the lack of phlegm\r\nin their make-up rather increases this activity, though they do not\r\nnecessarily accomplish more than those who take care to sit and\r\nlie still more.\r\n\r\nThe writer, at nineteen, spent four weeks on a farm behind the\r\nCatskills, in Delaware County, New York. It was harvest-time, and, full\r\nof athletic ardor, and eager to return to college the better for the\r\nvisit, we took a hand with the men. All the farm-hands were uniformly on\r\nthe field at six o'clock in the morning, and it would average nearly or\r\nquite eight at night before the last load was snugly housed away in the\r\nmow. It was sharp, hard work all day long, with a tough, wiry,\r\nsquare-loined fellow in the leading swath all the morning. But to follow\r\nhim we were bound to or drop, while the pitchfork or rake never rested\r\nfrom noon till sunset. Breakfast was served at five-thirty; dinner at\r\neleven; supper at four; and a generous bowl of bread-and-milk--or two\r\nbowls, if you wanted them--at nine o'clock, just before bedtime, with\r\nplenty of spring-water between meals; while the fare itself was good and\r\nsubstantial, just what you would find on any well-to-do farmer's table.\r\nAnd such an appetite, and such sleep! Solomon must have tried some\r\nsimilar adventure when he wrote that \"the sleep of the laboring man is\r\nsweet, whether he eat little or much.\" Well, when we returned to college\r\nand got on the scales again, the one hundred and forty-three pounds at\r\nstarting had somehow become a hundred and fifty-six! And with them such\r\na grip, and such a splendid feeling! We have rowed many a race since,\r\nbut there was as hard work done by some of that little squad on that old\r\nmountain farm as any man in our boat ever did, and there was not much\r\nattention paid to any one's training rules either.\r\n\r\nIt is notorious, among those used to training for athletic contests,\r\nthat thin men, if judiciously held in, and not allowed to do too much\r\nwork, generally \"train up,\" or gain decidedly in weight, almost as much,\r\nin fact, as the fleshy ones lose.\r\n\r\nNow, were the object simply to train up as much as possible, unusual\r\ncare could be taken to insure careful and deliberate eating, with a\r\ngenerous share of the fat and flesh making sorts of food, and quiet rest\r\nalways for awhile after each meal, to aid the digestive organs at their\r\nwork. Slow, deep, abdominal breathing is a great ally to this latter\r\nprocess; indeed, works direct benefit to many of the vital organs, and\r\nso to the whole man. All the sleep the man can possibly take at night\r\nwould also tell in the right way. So would everything that would tend\r\nto prevent fret and worry, or which would cultivate the ability to bear\r\nthem philosophically. But most thin people do not keep still enough, do\r\nnot take matters leisurely, and do not rest enough; while, if their work\r\nis muscular, they do too much daily in proportion to their strength.\r\n\r\nThey are very likely also to be inerect, with flat, thin chests, and\r\ncontracted stomach and abdomen. Now the habit of constantly keeping\r\nerect, whether sitting, standing, or walking, combined with this same\r\ndeep, abdominal breathing, soon tends to expand not only the lower ribs\r\nand lower part of the lungs, but the waist as well, so giving the\r\ndigestive organs more room and freer play. Like the lungs, or any other\r\norgan, they do their work best when in no way constrained. Better yet,\r\nif the person will also habituate himself, no matter what he is at,\r\nwhether in motion or sitting still, to not only breathing the lower half\r\nof the lungs full, but the whole lungs as well, and at each inspiration\r\nhold the air in his chest as long as he comfortably can, he will\r\nspeedily find a quickened and more vigorous circulation, which will be\r\nshown, for instance, by the veins in his hands becoming larger, and the\r\nhands themselves growing warmer if the air be cold; he will also feel a\r\nmild and agreeable exhilaration such as he has seldom before\r\nexperienced. Some of these are little things, and for that reason they\r\nare the easier to do; but in this business, as in many others, little\r\nthings often turn the scale. Of two brothers, equally thin, equally\r\nover-active, as much alike as possible--if one early formed these simple\r\nhabits of slow and thorough mastication, deep and full breathing,\r\nresting awhile after meals, carrying his body uniformly erect, and\r\nsleeping plentifully, and his brother all the while cared for none of\r\nthese things, it is highly probable that these little attentions would,\r\nin a few years, tell very decidedly in favor of him who practised them,\r\nand gradually bring to him that greater breadth, depth, and serenity,\r\nand the accompanying greater weight of the broad, full, and hearty man.\r\n\r\nAnd what about the old people? Take a person of sixty. You don't want\r\nhim to turn gymnast, surely. No; not to turn gymnast, but to set aside a\r\nsmall portion of each day for taking such body as he or she now has, and\r\nmaking the best of it.\r\n\r\nBut how can that be done? and is it practicable at all for a person\r\nsixty years old, or more? Well, let us see what one, not merely sixty,\r\nbut eighty, and more too, had to say on this point. Shortly after the\r\ndeath of the late William Cullen Bryant, the New York _Evening Post_, of\r\nwhich he had long been editor, published in its semi-weekly issue of\r\nJune 14th, 1878, the following letter:\r\n\r\n\"MR. BRYANT'S MODE OF LIFE.\r\n\r\n\"The following letter, written by Mr. Bryant several years ago,\r\ndescribing the habits of his life, to which he partly ascribed the\r\nwonderful preservation of his physical and mental vigor, will be read\r\nwith interest now:\r\n\r\n                                           \"'New York, March 30, 1871.\r\n   \"_'To Joseph H. Richards, Esq._:\r\n\r\n   \"'MY DEAR SIR,--I promised some time since to give you some account\r\n   of my habits of life, so far at least as regards diet, exercise,\r\n   and occupations. I am not sure that it will be of any use to you,\r\n   although the system which I have for many years observed seems to\r\n   answer my purpose very well. I have reached a pretty advanced\r\n   period of life, _without the usual infirmities of old age_, and\r\n   with my strength, activity, and bodily faculties generally, in\r\n   pretty good preservation. How far this may be the effect of\r\n   my way of life, adopted long ago and steadily adhered to, is\r\n   perhaps uncertain.\r\n\r\n   \"'I rise early; at this time of the year about half-past five; in\r\n   summer, half an hour or even an hour earlier. Immediately, with\r\n   very little encumbrance of clothing, I begin a series of exercises,\r\n   for the most part designed to expand the chest, and at the same\r\n   time call into action all the muscles and articulations of the\r\n   body. These are performed with dumb-bells, the very lightest,\r\n   covered with flannel, with a pole, a horizontal bar, and a light\r\n   chair swung around my head. After a full hour, and sometimes more,\r\n   passed in this manner, I bathe from head to foot. When at my place\r\n   in the country, I sometimes shorten my exercises in the chamber,\r\n   and, going out, occupy myself for half an hour or more in some work\r\n   which requires brisk exercise. After my bath, if breakfast be not\r\n   ready, I sit down to my studies till I am called.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   \"'After breakfast I occupy myself for awhile with my studies, and\r\n   then, when in town, I walk down to the office of the _Evening Post,\r\n   nearly three miles distant_, and, after about three hours, return,\r\n   always walking, _whatever be the weather or the state of the\r\n   streets_. In the country, I am engaged in my literary tasks till a\r\n   feeling of weariness drives me out into the open air, and I go upon\r\n   my farm or into the garden and prune the fruit-trees, or perform\r\n   some other work about them which they need, and then go back to my\r\n   books.

BRYANT.'\"\r\n\r\nThe same paper also contained the following:\r\n\r\n\"REMINISCENCES OF A FORMER BUSINESS ASSOCIATE.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. William G. Boggs, who knew Mr. Bryant intimately for many years,\r\nhas given the following reminiscences to a representative of the\r\n_Evening Post_:\r\n\r\n   \"'During the _forty years that I have known him, Mr. Bryant has\r\n   never been ill--never been confined to his bed, except on the\r\n   occasion of his last accident. His health has always been good_.\r\n\r\n   \"'Mr. Bryant was a great walker. In earlier years he would think\r\n   nothing of walking to Paterson Falls and back, with Alfred Pell and\r\n   James Lawson, after office hours. _He always walked from his home\r\n   to his place of business, even in his eighty-fourth year._ At first\r\n   he wouldn't ride in the elevator. He would never wait for it, if it\r\n   was not ready for the ascent immediately on his arrival in the\r\n   building. Of gymnastic exercises he was very fond. Every morning,\r\n   for half an hour, he would go through a series of evolutions on the\r\n   backs of two chairs placed side by side. He would hang on the door\r\n   of his bedroom, pulling himself up and down an indefinite number of\r\n   times. He would skirmish around the apartment after all fashions,\r\n   and once he told me even \"_under the table_.\" Breakfast followed,\r\n   then a walk down town; and then _he was in the best of spirits_ for\r\n   the writing of his editorial article for that day.\r\n\r\n          *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   \"'He was a constant student. His daily leading editorial\r\n   constituted, and was for many years, the _Evening Post_. Sometimes\r\n   he would not get it written until one o'clock. \"Can't I have it\r\n   earlier?\" I asked him one day. \"Why not write it the evening\r\n   before?\" \"Ah,\" he replied, \"if I should empty out the keg in that\r\n   way, it would soon be exhausted.\" He wanted his evenings for study.\r\n   \"Well, then, can't you get down earlier in the morning?\" He said,\r\n   \"Oh yes.\" A few months afterward he exclaimed, with reference to\r\n   the change: \"I like it. _I go through my gymnastics, walk all the\r\n   way down_, and when I get here I feel like work. I like it.\"'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Boggs also tells us that Mr. Bryant's sight and hearing were scarcely\r\nimpaired even up to his death.\r\n\r\nHow remarkable these facts seem! Here a man, known to the whole\r\ncivilized world, says at seventy-seven that he \"has reached a pretty\r\nadvanced period of life without the usual infirmities of old age, and\r\nwith his strength, activity, and bodily faculties generally in pretty\r\ngood preservation.\" Wouldn't most of us like to do that? Are there not\r\nmen who would promptly give millions, not \"for an inch of time,\" but to\r\nbe able to reach seventy-seven, and to say of themselves what Mr. Bryant\r\ncould say of himself at that age? Nor at seventy-seven only, but at\r\neighty-four, for his friend tells the same thing of him then.\r\n\r\nAnd notice what he did: \"Every morning,\" not for two or three minutes\r\nonly, but \"for half an hour, he would go through a series of evolutions\r\non the backs of two chairs placed side by side.\" The \"dips\" which have\r\nbeen recommended in another place,[K] and which are so excellent for\r\nmaking the chest strong and keeping it so, are doubtless the\r\n\"evolutions\" meant; and as the great majority of men, whether young or\r\nold, have not strength of triceps and pectorals enough to even struggle\r\nthrough one of them, some conception can be formed of how wonderfully\r\nwiry and strong this large-headed, spare-bodied, illustrious old man\r\nwas, to say nothing of the strength of purpose which would keep him so\r\nrigidly up to his work at an age when most men would have thought it\r\ntheir unquestionable duty to coddle themselves. Just think of a man over\r\neighty \"pulling himself up and down\"--evidently on the \"horizontal bar\"\r\nhe mentions--\"an indefinite number of times!\" Or \"always walking\" down\r\nto the office of the _Evening Post_, nearly three miles distant, and,\r\nafter three hours, return, always walking, whatever be the weather or\r\nthe state of the streets! Or of never waiting for the elevator if it\r\nwas not ready, but always walking up the _nine flights_ from the street\r\nto his office! And the writer has often seen him going up the top\r\nflight, and, instead of his step being faltering and feeble, it was\r\nuniformly _a trot_!\r\n\r\nSee what two other old men did--in some ways even a more remarkable\r\nthing than Mr. Bryant's great activity. The following despatch is from\r\nthe _New York Herald_ of February 23d, 1879:\r\n\r\n   \"THE OLD MEN'S WALK.\r\n\r\n                                     \"New Haven, Conn., Feb. 22, 1879.\r\n\r\n   \"The walk between Thomas Carey, of the New York Cotton Exchange,\r\n   and Joseph Y. Marsh, of this city, terminated to-night at a quarter\r\n   of an hour before the appointed time, Marsh withdrawing. Carey had\r\n   walked 211 miles and a fraction, to 209 miles and a corresponding\r\n   fraction for Marsh. After the walk Marsh said that he was convinced\r\n   that he had been beaten, and Carey made a speech expressing\r\n   satisfaction with the manner in which he had been treated. The walk\r\n   began on Wednesday of the present week, at eleven o'clock, and\r\n   terminated at forty-five minutes past ten to-night. Carey is a\r\n   great-grandfather, and is sixty-four years old, and Marsh\r\n   sixty-three. Both had trained for the walk. It is understood that\r\n   they will walk again in New York.\"\r\n\r\nSixty miles a day for three days and a half, and by a great-grandfather\r\nat that! Any man, or any horse, might well hold that a good day's work.\r\n\r\nThis activity among men so far on in years seems surprising. And why?\r\nBecause, as people get past middle-life, often from becoming engrossed\r\nin business, and out of the way of anything to induce them to continue\r\ntheir muscular activity, oftener from increasing caution, and fear that\r\nsome effort, formerly easy, may now prove hazardous to them, they\r\npurposely avoid even ordinary exercise--riding when they might, and\r\nindeed ought to, walk, and, instead of walking their six miles a day,\r\nand looking after their arms and chests besides, as Bryant did,\r\ngradually come to do nothing each day worthy of the name of exercise.\r\nThen the joints grow dry and stiff, and snap and crack as they work. The\r\nold ease of action is gone, and disinclination takes its place. The man\r\nmakes up his mind that he is growing old and stiff--often before he is\r\nsixty--and that there is no help for that stiffness.\r\n\r\nWell, letting the machinery alone works a good deal the same whether it\r\nis made of iron and steel, and driven by steam, or of flesh and blood\r\nand bones, and driven by the human heart. Maclaren cleverly compares\r\nthis stiffening of the joints to the working of hinges, which, when\r\n\"left unused and unoiled for any length of time, grate and creak, and\r\nmove stiffly. The hinges of the human body do just the same thing, and\r\nfrom the same cause; and they not only require frequent oiling to enable\r\nthem to move easily, but they _are_ oiled every time they are put in\r\nmotion, _and when they are put in motion only_. The membrane which\r\nsecretes this oil, and pours it forth over the opposing surfaces of the\r\nbones and the overlying ligaments, is stimulated to activity only by the\r\nmotion of the joint itself.\" Had Bryant spared himself as most men do,\r\nwould he have been such a springy, easy walker, and so strong and handy\r\nat eighty-four? Does it not look as if the half-hour at the dumb-bells,\r\nand chairs, and horizontal bar, and the twelve or fifteen thousand steps\r\nwhich he took each day, had much to do with this spring and activity in\r\nsuch a green old age? Does it not look almost as if he had, half a\r\ncentury ago, read something not unlike the following from Maclaren:\r\n\r\n\"The first course of the system may be freely and almost unconditionally\r\nrecommended to men throughout what may be called middle life, care being\r\ntaken to use a bell and bar well within the physical capacity. The\r\nbest time for this practice is in the early morning, immediately\r\nafter the bath, and, when regularly taken, it need not extend over\r\nmore than a few minutes.\"\r\n\r\nWhether Bryant had ever seen these rules or not, the bell, the bar, and\r\nthe morning-time for exercise make a noticeable coincidence.\r\n\r\nLooking at the benefit daily exercise brought in the instances\r\nmentioned, would it not be well for every man who begins to feel his\r\nage to at once adopt some equally moderate and sensible course of daily\r\nexercise, and to enter on it with a good share of his own former energy\r\nand vigor? He does not need to live in the country to effect it, nor in\r\nthe city. He can readily secure the few bits of apparatus suggested\r\nelsewhere[L] for his own home, wherever that home is, and so take care\r\nof his arms and chest. For foot-work there is always the road. Is it not\r\nworth while to make the effort? He can begin very mildly, and yet in a\r\nmonth reach quite a creditable degree of activity, and then keep that\r\nup. And if, as Mr. Bryant did, he should last till well past eighty,\r\nand, like him, keep free from deafness and dimness of vision, from\r\nstiffness and shortness of breath, from gout, rheumatism, paralysis, and\r\nother senile ailments, as he put it himself, \"without the usual\r\ninfirmities of old age\"--indeed, with his \"strength, activity, and\r\nbodily faculties generally in pretty good preservation,\" and all that\r\ntime could attend promptly to all the daily duties of an active\r\nbusiness as he did, as Vanderbilt did, as Palmerston did, as Thiers\r\ndid--is not the effort truly worth the making? And who knows what\r\nhe can do till he tries?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[K] See page 240.\r\n\r\n[L] See page 91.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nHALF-TRAINED FIREMEN AND POLICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two classes of men in our cities and larger towns who, more\r\nthan almost any others, need daily and systematic bodily exercise, in\r\norder to make them efficient for their duties, and something like what\r\nmen in their lines ought to be. In times of peace they do in many ways\r\nwhat the army does for the whole country in war-time--they protect life\r\nand property. These are the police and firemen.\r\n\r\nThe work of some of the firemen before they reach a fire is even more\r\ndangerous than when actually among the flames. The examining physician\r\nof one of our largest life insurance companies told the writer that he\r\nfrequently had to reject firemen applying for insurance, because they\r\nhad seriously injured their hearts by running hard to fires when quite\r\nuntrained and unfit for such sudden and severe strain on the heart and\r\nlungs, imposed, as it usually is, under much excitement. The\r\nintroduction of steam fire-engines has in part done away with this,\r\nthough even they often have a man to run before and clear the way; but\r\nin smaller places, of course, the old danger exists. Thorough and\r\nefficient as this steam-service is in many ways, and trained as the men\r\nare to their duties, they are, very many of them, not nearly so\r\neffective as they might easily be, and as, considering the fact that the\r\nfireman's work is their sole occupation, they ought to be. Men of pluck\r\nand daring, and naturally strong, often for days together they have no\r\nfire to go to, and so sit and stand around the engine-house for hours\r\nand hours. Soon they begin to fatten, until often they weigh thirty or\r\nforty pounds more than they would in good condition for enduring work.\r\nHaving no daily exercise which gives all parts of the body increased\r\nlife and strength, neither the stout nor thin ones begin to be so\r\nstrong, so quick of movement, or enduring as they would be if kept in\r\ngood condition. To carry from an upper story of a high building a person\r\nin a swoon or half suffocated, and to get such a burden safely down a\r\nlong narrow ladder through stifling smoke and terrible flame, is a feat\r\nrequiring, beside great nerve and courage, decided strength and\r\nendurance. Exposure during long periods, perhaps drenched through,\r\nperhaps holding up a heavy hose in the winter's cold, or in many another\r\nduty all firemen well know, often without food or drink for many hours,\r\ntaxes very severely even the strongest man.\r\n\r\nAnd what training have these men for this trying work outside of what\r\nthe fire itself actually gives? Practically, none. Suppose every man on\r\nthe force was required to spend an hour, or even half an hour, daily in\r\nwork which would call into play not all their muscles, but simply those\r\nlikely to be most needed when the real work came. Suppose each of them a\r\nwiry, hard-muscled, very enduring man, good any day for a three or five\r\nmile run at a respectable pace, and without detriment to himself, or to\r\ngo, if need be, hand over hand up the entire length of one of their long\r\nladders--to be, in short, as strong, as handy, as enduring, as even a\r\nsecond-rate athlete. Is there any question that a force made up of such\r\nmen would be far better qualified for their work, and far more efficient\r\nat it, than the firemen of any of our cities are now?\r\n\r\nAnd if they think they at present have considerable daily exercise, so\r\ndoes a British soldier decidedly more, in his daily drilling, and the\r\nwhole round of his duties; and yet, after Maclaren had one of them\r\nexercising for but a brief period, but in a way to bring up his general\r\nstrength, the soldier said, \"I feel twice the man I did for anything a\r\nman could be set to do.\" Would it hurt a fireman or a policeman any to\r\nhave that feeling? Would the latter not be more inclined to rely on his\r\nown strength, and less on his club?\r\n\r\nIf the training suggested seems too hard, look at the younger men in\r\nblacksmithing, for instance, and many other kinds of iron-work,\r\nswinging, as they often do, a heavy sledge for the whole day together;\r\nat the postmen, walking from morning to evening, often up many flights\r\nof stairs, and all the year round, and in all weathers; at the\r\niron-puddler, the hod-carrier, the 'longshoreman--all at work nearly or\r\nquite as hard, not for one short hour only, but through all the burden\r\nand heat of the day. Many of these men are not nearly as well paid as\r\nthe firemen, and none of them begin to have as great responsibility, or\r\nare at any moment likely to be called on to take their lives in their\r\nhands, and perhaps to save other lives as well.\r\n\r\nLet us look at the policeman. What exercise has he? Standing around, and\r\nconsiderable slow walking, for six hours out of each twelve. Is there\r\nanything to make him swift of foot? No. Anything to build up his arms\r\nand expand his chest, to make those arms help him in his business, and\r\nthose hands twice as skilful for his purposes as before? Very little.\r\nTaught to use his hands he is, but never empty; there must be something\r\nin them--a club or a revolver. And so comes what legitimate result? Why\r\nis it that in a conflict, or even a threatened one--or, too often, not\r\neven then--and when the culprit, while drunk, is wholly unresisting, we\r\nconstantly hear of these dangerous weapons being drawn and freely used?\r\nSome of the very men set to preserve the peace are themselves every now\r\nand then making assaults wholly uncalled for, always cowardly, and often\r\nbrutal, and such as an athletic man, proud of his strength, would have\r\nscorned the idea of making, but, instead, would have so quickly\r\ndisplayed his skill and strength that the average offender, especially\r\nwhen he recalled the fact that the officer had the law on his side,\r\nwould have soon ceased resisting. Every intelligent New Yorker will at\r\none recognize that there is far too frequently good ground for such\r\neditorial comment, grim as is its satire, as the following from a\r\nwell-known New York journal, of September 20th, 1878:\r\n\r\n   \"A COMPLICATED POLICE CASE.\r\n\r\n   \"We have recorded from time to time in the T---- various\r\n   interesting police cases. With all our skill and experience,\r\n   however, we could not prevent a shade of monotony stealing over\r\n   them. When in nine cases out of ten the picture presented is that\r\n   of a policeman clubbing a man nearly to death, by what resource of\r\n   rhetoric can you avoid monotony? For the sake of variety, as well\r\n   as for the public good, many people wish that a citizen would\r\n   occasionally kill a brutal policeman; only that, in thus ridding\r\n   the world of a human brute not worthy to live in it, the mockery\r\n   that is called justice in New York and Brooklyn would probably also\r\n   send out of the world the inoffensive citizen who had accomplished\r\n   the good work. In a recent case, however, matters have become most\r\n   ingeniously complicated. One policeman has arrested another. On\r\n   Tuesday night two men got into a fight in the Bowery. Detective\r\n   Archibald, who was in plain clothes, undertook, it is said, to\r\n   arrest them. Then, it is stated, Officer Lefferts arrived, and\r\n   arrested the whole party, detective and all. We say that this is a\r\n   complicated case; but so it did not seem to Justice Morgan, of the\r\n   Jefferson Market Police Court. If a policeman arrests a citizen, it\r\n   is no longer possible for the latter to get justice. He is glad if\r\n   he can get away with a whole skull and unbroken ribs. But one\r\n   policeman arresting another! The only way in which this can be\r\n   set right depends upon which policeman had the most influence\r\n   at head-quarters.\"\r\n\r\nAnd what sort of man is he who is thus too free with his weapon? Take\r\nhim in New York city, for instance. Out of nearly twenty-five hundred\r\npolicemen, it is entirely safe to say that one-third--and it would\r\nprobably be much nearer the truth to say that all of two-thirds--are\r\nunathletic men, and that a very large proportion of these are either\r\nclumsy, unwieldy, and short-winded, or not possessed of even average\r\nbodily strength. Even in their uniforms this is quickly apparent; but\r\nthe true way to judge is to see them stripped, either in gymnastic\r\ncostume or at the swimming-bath. Any number of them have indifferent\r\nlegs; there are any number of stout, paunchy fellows; and old ones, too,\r\ndoubling over with their years; flat-chested ones, big-footed and\r\nhalf-built men.\r\n\r\nTry to select some of these men for a physical feat, say of speed and\r\nendurance, like running or rowing, and see how few would be fit for the\r\nwork. Pair them off, give them gloves, and set them to boxing, and there\r\nwould scarce be one hundred good sparrers out of the whole brigade.\r\nOnce, right in front of Trinity church-yard, on Broadway, we saw two of\r\nthe Broadway squad put up their hands for a little good-natured\r\nsparring, and the way they did it would hardly have been creditable to a\r\nten-year-old. To see two great, hulking six-footers, ignorant of the\r\nfirst rudiments of good sparring, actually whirling their fists round\r\nand round each other as if winding yarn, and with no sort of idea how to\r\nuse even one hand, let alone two, was positively ridiculous. A\r\nhundred-pound thief, handy with his fists and quick of foot, could have\r\nslapped their faces, and, if they could run no better than they sparred,\r\ncould have been at the Battery before either of them was half-way. And\r\nwhat good would their weapons have been? Their revolvers they would\r\nhardly dare to use in a crowded street at broad noon, nor would they\r\nhave been justified in so doing. And their clubs--of what use would they\r\nbe if the culprit was a block away?\r\n\r\nThe writer once saw a fellow, apparently a sneak-thief, cutting across\r\nthe City Hall Park, in front of the _Tribune_ building, at a clipping\r\npace, while some distance behind came one of those majestic but logy\r\nguardians of the peace, making about one foot to the other's two, and,\r\nfinally, seeing how hopeless was the pursuit, bringing his club around\r\nand throwing it after the escaping thief--and with what result?\r\nExcellent for the thief, for, instead of coming anywhere near him, it\r\npassed dangerously close to the abdomen of a worthy but obese citizen,\r\nwho chanced to be passing that way.\r\n\r\nAt a public exhibition, held early in 1878, under the auspices of these\r\nvery Metropolitan Police, at the Hippodrome, in New York, where\r\ndoubtless the very best boxers on the whole force were on the boards,\r\nand with ten thousand spectators to spur them on to their utmost, the\r\nthoroughly skilful and accomplished workmen could be counted almost on\r\nthe thumbs; while, in the tug of war, the string of policemen were\r\noverhauled and pulled completely down by the Scottish Americans, who\r\nweighed half a hundred weight less per man than their uniformed\r\nantagonists; though it is but just to add that, later on, the latter did\r\nmanage to win, yet what was that to brag of?\r\n\r\nThe same Police Department held a regatta on the Harlem River on the\r\ntwenty-ninth of August, 1878, for which there were many entries; yet out\r\nof them all with one or two exceptions, there was no performance which\r\nwas not of the most commonplace character, unworthy of an average\r\nfreshman crew, and this though many of the rowers were burly, heavy men.\r\nOne of the single-scullers actually did not know how to back his boat\r\nover some fifty feet of water, and, after four ineffectual endeavors,\r\nhad to be told how to do so from the referee's boat.\r\n\r\nNow place the whole force abreast on a broad common, or in half a dozen\r\nlines, and set them to run a mile at no racing pace; at no such gait\r\neven as John Ennis went in March, 1879, when, after 474 miles of walking\r\nand running in one single week, he ran his 475th mile in six minutes\r\neleven seconds, but let them go at even a horse-car pace; and if five\r\nhundred get over even half the distance it will be a surprise, while of\r\nthose who do, many stand a good chance to feel the effects for days, if\r\nnot for life. We asked the best known police captain in New York city,\r\nthe president of the old Police Athletic Club, whether he thought\r\none-half of the whole twenty-five hundred could run a mile at any pace\r\nwhich could actually be called a run. After deliberating a little, he\r\nsaid he did not think they could. One of the most successful athletes on\r\nthe force, in reply to the same question, said: \"I'll bet my neck\r\nagainst a purse that not one-third of them can do it.\" Another, a\r\nmagnificent-looking man, standing over six feet three in height, and\r\nweighing upward of two hundred and fifty, not only strongly inclined to\r\nthe same opinion, but, when urged to tell how successful he himself\r\nwould probably be in such a trial, he gave, with a little sudden color\r\nin his cheeks, substantially as follows, this most interesting incident\r\nfrom his own experience:\r\n\r\nStanding in a rear room on the main floor of the station-house of the\r\n---- Precinct, he heard a scream. Going quickly to the street, a lady\r\ntold him that she had been robbed of her pocket-book, while a young\r\nperson gliding gracefully, and, as the sequel proved, quite fleetly,\r\naround the corner, lent force to the statement. Away went the engine of\r\nthe law, his mighty form bending to the work, with his best foot\r\nforemost. Turning up one of the broad avenues, the one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five feet or so of the thief's start had now shrunk to\r\nseventy-five, and, as the two sped on at a grand pace,\r\n\r\n  \"All and each that passed that way\r\n  Enjoyed the swift 'pursuit.'\"\r\n\r\nBlock after block was passed, but the gap would not close. Go as he\r\nwould, do his mightiest and his best, it was of no use; that lawless\r\nyoung man would somehow all the time manage to keep just seventy-five\r\nfeet to the fore. Four blocks are now done, and so is the policeman; and\r\nbringing up all-standing--blown, gasping, exhausted--he cannot even\r\nmuster breath enough to shout, but, reaching his big hand out in front\r\nof him, and looking at the young person gently fleeting, with seemingly\r\nunabated vigor, into the dim distance, he sadly points to him, for that\r\nis all he is just now equal to. Fortunately for the interests of justice\r\nand good order, that point is well taken, for a brother officer sees it,\r\nand, rising to the occasion, dashes off after the misguided young person\r\nup the avenue. \"Life is earnest\" now, surely, for the latter. Still he\r\nhas nearly a hundred feet start, and maybe this second guardian of the\r\npeace will not stay any better than did his illustrious predecessor. So\r\ndown to it he settles again, and the street enjoys the fun. Block after\r\nblock slips away, and so does the official wind, for, at the end of four\r\nblocks more, no perceptible decrease of the gap having yet been made,\r\npatrolman number two \"shuts up.\" Yes, literally, for he too cannot even\r\nyell, but, like the first, striking a tragic position, he points to the\r\nflying culprit. And is justice to be cheated out of her victim after\r\nall, even now, when she a second time is sure that she has reached the\r\npoint? And is this light-fingered and light-heeled young person to\r\nescape the minions of the law--and all this in broad daylight too, and\r\nright on Sixth Avenue? So it certainly seems. But stop! Justice, after\r\nall, is to prevail, for lo! a third pursuer has now caught the trail,\r\nand is off like a fast mail-train. Have a care now, young man! No brass\r\nbuttons adorn your pursuer this time; but the self-appointed private\r\ncitizen, now in your wake, runs as the wicked flee. There is no\r\ncart-horse pace about his work; but with one clean, business-like spurt,\r\nhe swoops down on the now disturbed young man, and, clutching his upper\r\ngarments, holds him neatly until the reserves come up, and then hands\r\nhim over for his six months on the island.\"\r\n\r\nOne more illustration may suffice. The _New York Herald_ of December\r\n20th, 1878, referring to a burglary which had been committed in the\r\n28th Precinct, said that suspicion fastened on a young man known as\r\n\"Sleepy Dick.\" Detective Wilson got on the supposed offender's trail,\r\nand the nearer he got to him the worse grew his character for\r\nstrength, daring, and ferocity. At last he came up with \"Sleepy Dick\"\r\non Second Avenue yesterday.\r\n\r\n\"'The jig's up, Sleepy,' said the detective; 'you're wanted.'\r\n\r\n\"'What for?' calmly inquired the other, straightening upon the coal-box.\r\n\r\n\"'Cracking a crib.'\r\n\r\n\"'How long a stretch?'\r\n\r\n\"'A fiver, sure.'\r\n\r\n\"'I'm not your meat then, cully,' and Dick bolted for the corner with no\r\nsleepiness about him. Wilson grabbed him firmly by the collar, though,\r\nand there was a scene of plunging and tearing witnessed by the crowd\r\naround them that eclipsed Cornwall or Graeco-Roman wrestling.\r\n\r\n\"Suddenly a revolver came flashing out of Wilson's pocket.\r\n\r\n\"'I'm taking this pot,' said he, coolly.\r\n\r\n\"'Show your hand,' growled 'Sleepy.'\r\n\r\n\"'A straight flush;' and Wilson levelled the pistol at his head.\r\n\r\n\"'That takes this pile,' Dick sullenly assented, and he moved on quietly\r\nas far as Sixty-first Street. Once at the corner, he plunged backward\r\nand broke loose. The detective's revolver came down on his head with a\r\nthud, but he rallied under the blow, sprung aside, and made for the\r\nriver. He was fleet of foot, and, as he flew down the street, he kept\r\nlooking over his shoulder, evidently in fear of a passing bullet. But\r\nthe detective was coming on after him, bound to run him down, and as\r\nthey passed First Avenue the hue and cry was taken up by two other\r\npolicemen, who joined in the pursuit. There was fully a block between\r\n'Sleepy' and his pursuers when he neared the river. He saw his\r\nadvantage, turned into a stone-yard, dodged among the bowlders, scaled a\r\nfence, and made off. Dick has been in the hands of the police before\r\nthis week, but managed to get away.\"\r\n\r\nIs there no lesson for our city rulers in such facts as these? If our\r\npolice are men of only four block power; if they are so blown in that\r\nlittle distance that they are utterly helpless, and all they can do is,\r\none after another to point to the escaping felon and indulge in these\r\n\"brilliant flashes of silence,\" inwardly imploring some good civilian to\r\nkindly catch that thief; if a youngster can first indulge in a tough\r\nwrestle with a detective, and then, taking a heavy blow on his head from\r\nthe butt of a revolver, not only empty-handed get away from his would-be\r\ncaptor, but, although the latter is joined by two policemen, soon put a\r\nwhole block between him and them, and springing over a fence, go, after\r\nall, \"unwhipt of justice,\" does it not strike the reader that a little\r\nimprovement in the speed and stay of our policemen might do no harm? Had\r\nit not better be conceded that it is hopeless for many of the Broadway\r\nsquad, for instance, in their present condition, to attempt to catch a\r\nthief by running; after him, and would it not be well to provide each of\r\nthem with a lasso, for short-range work, and initiate them in its uses\r\nat once? In this way they could certainly make sure of one of those\r\nlight-heeled gentry once in a while, perhaps--for example, one fond\r\nof lady's ear-rings. And who believes that officers always report\r\ntheir failures to catch thieves, or that the public ever hears of\r\none-half of such cases?\r\n\r\nLet us see, too, where this physical incapacity may lead to graver\r\nconsequences than the mere allowing a detected thief to run at large. In\r\nthe great cities there have sprung up within a few years back\r\nstorehouses for the safe-keeping of securities, plate, important papers,\r\nand other valuables. Hedged around with plates of steel,\r\nchronometer-locks, massive bolts, and several watchmen, and connected\r\nwith the nearest police station by wires so arranged that the doors\r\ncannot be opened without sounding the alarm at the station-house, the\r\npublic naturally put their trust in them, and their property too. Within\r\nrecent years we also hear far more than formerly of burglars going not\r\nin pairs or threes, but in gangs of half a dozen or more, and of\r\ncracking safes always thought impenetrable. Now, suppose that a descent\r\nwere made on the largest one of these safe depositories in America, the\r\none under the New York Stock Exchange, and by a dozen first-class\r\ncracksmen. Their business hours are generally between one and four in\r\nthe morning. That they work with wonderful sagacity, daring, and\r\ndespatch, is attested by such brilliant performance as that at the\r\nNorthampton Bank robbery, or when they in a little time, one morning,\r\nrelieved the Manhattan Bank of a few millions, and that right within a\r\nblock of police head-quarters in New York city. Suppose that, by\r\ncollusion or otherwise, the robbers get through the outer door. Unlike\r\nthe Bank of England, there is no platoon of soldiers on guard. They\r\nsilence the three or four who oppose them. They come to the inner doors,\r\nthe opening of which alarms the police. At the station-house, when that\r\nalarm sounds, three or four, or maybe more, more or less drowsy officers\r\nstart and run for the Stock Exchange, some eight hundred feet away. Is\r\nthere any especial reason why they should be any less exhausted when\r\nthey get there than the two policemen who failed to catch the Sixth\r\nAvenue thief, or the two who let another on First Avenue run clear out\r\nof their sight? The four blocks the former two policemen ran do not make\r\nmuch over eight hundred feet. Suppose that three or four, not half-grown\r\nfellows like \"sleepy\" Dick, but stalwart desperadoes, used to rough\r\nwork, quietly await the arrival of these worthy, but well-blown\r\npatrolmen. How long would it take the thieves to at least check the\r\nadvance, if not also considerably impair the usefulness of men so\r\nnearly gone that they could not speak, and whose hands shook so that\r\naiming a revolver effectively would be practically out of the question?\r\n\r\nAnd might not the Press justly have some pretty plain comment to make,\r\nthen, on the physical inefficiency of our police force, and wonder why\r\nit had not been insisted on long ago that they be trained as men have to\r\nbe in other callings, until they are fit for their work? Hear Dr.\r\nMorgan, in \"University Oars,\" on fat and unwieldy men, and their\r\nunfitness for emergencies calling for strong and quick work: \"When,\r\ntherefore, we hear of a man who, at twenty years of age, weighed 12\r\nstone (168 pounds), and in after-life inclining to corpulency, has\r\nreached the abnormal weight of 17 or 18 stone (238 or 252 pounds), we\r\nmust not consider him proportionately stronger: on the contrary, he\r\nshould rather excite our pity and commiseration--the _five or six stone\r\ndistributed over his body being composed wholly of adipose tissue_. He\r\nis thus as completely enveloped in blubber as though he were a whale or\r\na seal. His muscles being heavily weighted, _his powers of locomotion\r\nare necessarily limited_; and, handicapped in this manner, it is no easy\r\ntask for him to drag his unwieldy frame on some sweltering 12th of\r\nAugust over the trying inequalities of a Highland moor.\"\r\n\r\nThe broken-winded man, or a man out of wind, is almost as useless in an\r\nemergency calling for sharp and sudden work as a broken-winded horse.\r\nThe standing around of the policeman, heavily shod and heavily clad,\r\nand the lazy, aimless walking, will never make him hardy, tough, and\r\ndifficult to face, or likely not to use his club where a strong, quick\r\nman would never need it. Swollen hands and feet, and soft, flabby\r\nflesh will be the result; and for the variety of sudden and dangerous\r\nwork which he may be called upon to do at any moment he is not half\r\nfitted; and if he trains no more for his work than he does now,\r\nhe never will be.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the matter of looks--not the least important, by any means, of\r\nthe qualifications of a police-officer--are they all that they might be,\r\nand that they really ought to be?\r\n\r\nWhen a thousand of them, averaging two hundred pounds apiece, parade\r\ndown Broadway, with brass buttons gleaming, and every belt well filled,\r\nit is easy enough for Press or citizen to say, \"What a fine-looking body\r\nof men!\" But now, notice them closely, and most of them are inerect,\r\nmany are round-shouldered, and few are at once thoroughly well-built men\r\nand in good condition, being either loose-jointed, too fat, or too thin.\r\nContrast their marching and bearing with that of the little West Point\r\nbattalion on parade, every man erect, clean-cut, precise, wiry, and\r\nathletic; light and young, to be sure, but most hardy, quick, and\r\nmanly. Now, we know what it is to be erect. We soon discover that the\r\nbulk, the sunburn, and the uniforms have gone far toward making the\r\nfavorable impression, which ought to have been better based, and that\r\nalmost every one of these policemen is plainly faulty.\r\n\r\nNow, suppose every one of these twenty-five hundred men, besides being,\r\nas most of them already are, both courageous and faithful in the\r\nperformance of duty, was a skilful and hard-hitting boxer, a good,\r\nsteady, long-distance runner, a fair wrestler, a strong swimmer, a\r\nsound, hale, thoroughly well-made man. Let the vicious classes once\r\nknow--and how long would it take them to learn?--that in a race between\r\nthem and the policeman the latter would be pretty sure to win; let it be\r\nknown that, when he once caught his man, the odds would be decidedly in\r\nhis favor, and that that man would not get away; let every member of the\r\nforce be justly known as a formidable man to face, and one whom the\r\noffender had better avoid--and what an advance it would be in both the\r\nmoral and physical efficiency of the force! Now let the riot come, and\r\nsee what that little band of twenty-five hundred trained men could do\r\nagainst ten times their number. To-day they have nothing which makes\r\nthem enduring at quick, hard work, and that is what is wanted for mobs.\r\nIf they had an abundance of that which would make them so, the plying\r\nof a locust for an hour or two among a lot of unorganized roughs would\r\nbe almost a diversion, and a game they could continue at by the\r\nweek if need be.\r\n\r\nAnd why should not every city in our land have, instead of men very many\r\nof them too often far out of condition, these same well-trained men,\r\neducated, as men have to be in nearly every other calling, directly for\r\ntheir work, and all dexterous and able? Is it asking too much? The\r\npreparation necessary to it will not compare in its exhausting effects\r\nwith what the war-policeman--the soldier, who is not paid a quarter as\r\nmuch--must do without a murmur: the long forced marching, weighted like\r\na pack-horse, the broken sleep, the stinted food, the bad shoes, the\r\nlong absence from home, and the lack of all comforts. Why not insist on\r\na regime which, if the fat man could go through and retain his\r\ncorporosity, would make him welcome to retain it; if the thin man could\r\nbe up to every day's work in it, then he could stand far more than he\r\nlooked equal to? But if either failed, out with him. There need be no\r\nfear that good substitutes could not be had in abundance.\r\n\r\nThis is no question of mere health, and symmetry of make, and reasonable\r\nstrength, as with the ordinary citizen. It is a matter of fitness for\r\nordinary duties--duties often of very great importance to the public\r\nweal, which may spring up at any moment, and which call for unusual\r\nphysical resources. It is a matter of substituting for dangerous\r\nweapons, rashly wielded, and when that wielding is often wholly\r\nuncalled for, men who, in any ordinary street-brawl, need no weapon,\r\nand would scarcely think of using one, any more than would a Morrissey,\r\na Heenan, or a Hyer.\r\n\r\nAs nearly as possible in the centre of each four precincts in the larger\r\ncities hire a hall, say about eighty feet by forty, and the higher the\r\nbetter, well lighted and ventilated, and easily heated. Two hundred\r\ndollars, carefully spent, would buy all needed apparatus, and as much\r\nmore would keep it swept and dusted, lighted and warmed. Twenty-five\r\ncents a month from each of four hundred policemen would be twelve\r\nhundred dollars a year, which would cover, beside these items, rent and\r\nsalary of teacher as well. For the teacher need be with them but a\r\nlittle while daily; for, in about all the exercises necessary to make\r\nmen good ordinary runners and boxers, a teacher up to his work can drill\r\nthe men in squads. What they want is not intricate and technical\r\nknowledge, but plain, straightforward, swift, hard work, and plenty of\r\nit, and the condition which keeps them easily up to it. Or, better yet,\r\nput these gymnasiums in charge of the department, if equally rigid\r\neconomy could be insured. Then require each man to spend fifteen minutes\r\nthere every other day, sparring--after he had the rudiments--with some\r\ncompanion who can give him all the exercise he wants, and on the\r\nalternate days let an equal period of time be spent in running, not at\r\nracing pace, but still good lively work of the kind which brings good\r\nlungs and good legs. Now, at the annual or semi-annual athletic meeting,\r\nlet picked men from each precinct contend in foot-races, both for short\r\nand long distances; and, to give their work an even more practical turn,\r\ngive some sneak-thief a reasonable start in such contests, and let the\r\nofficers, in full uniform of course, catch him if they can. Now the\r\nwaistbands will begin to lessen, and a considerably smaller measure of\r\ncloth will cover the man, but it will clothe a man who, unarmed and\r\nunaided, can whip almost half a dozen such flabby, untrained, unskilful\r\nfellows as he used to be. For every duty which may at any moment become\r\nhis, whether light or heavy, mild or violent, he will be far better\r\nqualified in almost every respect than before, yet no better in his line\r\nthan any good business man requires each person in his employ to be in\r\nhis, no matter what their particular duties may be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL EXERCISE FOR ANY GIVEN MUSCLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile symmetrical and thorough physical development are not at all\r\ncommon among Americans, and undeveloped, inerect, and weak bodies almost\r\noutnumber any other kind, the general want of familiarity with what will\r\ndevelop any given muscles, and bring them up to the fulness and strength\r\nwhich ought to be theirs, is even more surprising. If proof is wanted of\r\nthis, let the reader ask himself what special work he would choose to\r\ndevelop any given part; the muscles of the forearm, for instance, or\r\nthose of the front of the chest. If he has ever paid any attention to\r\nhis physical development--and thousands and tens of thousands have\r\nnot--he may know one or two things which will bring about the desired\r\nresult; but even if he has attended the gymnasium a good deal, he will\r\noften be surprised to find that his time there was mainly spent in\r\naccomplishing some particular feat or amount of work, rather than in\r\nbringing about the special development of any given part, or general\r\ndevelopment of the whole body.\r\n\r\nNow, while the exercises which bring any given set of muscles into play\r\nare very numerous, if a few can be grouped together which shall be at\r\nonce simple and plain, and shall call either for inexpensive apparatus\r\nor none at all, which will also enable almost any one, by a little\r\nenergy and determination, to bring up any limb or muscles now weak, they\r\nmay prove of value.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To develop the Leg below the Knee._\r\n\r\nThe main part of the leg below the knee, for instance, is composed of\r\nmuscles which raise the heel. Stand erect, with the head high, chest\r\nout, and shoulders down, keeping the knees all the time well sprung\r\nback, having the feet about three inches apart, with the toes turned\r\nslightly outward. Now slowly raise the heels until they are high off the\r\nfloor, and the whole weight rests on the soles and toes. Now drop slowly\r\ndown. Then repeat. Next place the hand on the muscles of the calf, and\r\nwhile at first not firm, feel them harden as you rise, and all doubt as\r\nto whether the exercise in question uses these muscles will speedily\r\nvanish. Continue this exercise at the same rate, keeping at it until you\r\nhave risen fifty times. Now, it will not be necessary, with most\r\npersons, to have to place the hand on these muscles to learn if they are\r\nbrought into play, for already that is becoming very plain in another\r\nway, one that is bringing most conclusive proof to the mind--internal\r\nevidence it might well be called. Unless the calves are unusually\r\nstrong, long before the one hundredth effort there is an unmistakable\r\nache in them, which, in the majority of instances, will cause the person\r\nto stop outright from sheer inability to proceed. It has not taken much\r\ntime to get a pretty thorough measure of about what power there is in\r\none set of muscles at least. All doubts are gone from his mind now as to\r\nwhether one exercise he knows will call into play the muscles of his leg\r\nbelow the knee or not. It is equally plain that it is not his forearm,\r\nor upper arm, or the back or front of his chest which has been in\r\naction, for none of these have felt fatigue, the tire being all confined\r\nto the muscles in question.\r\n\r\nAgain, had there been beside him two men of nearly the same weight, but\r\none of small and feeble calves, the other having them shapely and\r\nwell-developed, is there any doubt which of the two could have kept at\r\nthe exercise the longer, yet with the less fatigue? Few men need be told\r\nthat a muscle, unused to work at first, can gradually, by direct and\r\nsystematic exercise, be strengthened; but not a few there are who are\r\nunaware that with the new strength comes increased size as well.\r\n\r\nYet, to those familiar with athletic work, it is as plain as that you\r\nmust have your eyes open if you want to see. A gentleman of our\r\nacquaintance, of magnificent muscular and vital development, was not\r\nsatisfied with the girth of his calves, which was 14-1/4 inches. At our\r\nsuggestion he began practising this simple raising and lowering of the\r\nheels. In less than four months he had increased the girth of each calf\r\none whole inch. When asked how many strokes a day he averaged, he said,\r\n\"From fifteen hundred to two thousand;\" varied some days by his holding\r\nin each hand during the process a twelve-pound dumb-bell, and then only\r\ndoing one thousand or thereabouts. The time he found most convenient\r\nwas in the morning on rising, and just before retiring at night.\r\nInstead of the work taking much time, seventy a minute was found a\r\ngood ordinary rate, so that fifteen minutes at each end of the day\r\nwas all he needed. But this was a great and very rapid increase,\r\nespecially for a man of thirty-five; far more than most persons would\r\nnaturally be contented with, yet suggestive of the stuff and\r\nperseverance of the man who accomplished it.\r\n\r\nHere, then, one of the most effective exercises which could be desired\r\nfor the strengthening of these muscles is accomplished actually without\r\napparatus, without one cent of expense--one which can be practised\r\nanywhere, in the largest or the smallest room, in-doors or out,\r\non land or while at sea.\r\n\r\nBut there are many other exercises which will bring this same\r\ndevelopment. Now stand erect again, with head and chest high, shoulders\r\nlow, and knees sprung back. Start off at an ordinary pace, and walk.\r\nBut, instead of, as usual, putting the foot down and lifting it without\r\nthinking about it, this time, just as it leaves the ground, press hard\r\nwith the soles and toes. Go on for a block or two, and you will suddenly\r\nfind that your calves are having new and unwonted duties--indeed,\r\na very generous share of work. Keep on for a mile--if you can. Good\r\na walker as you thought yourself before, a mile of this sort will be\r\na mile to be remembered--certainly for a few days, till the ache gets\r\nout of your calves.\r\n\r\nIf walking with this new push is not hard enough on flat ground, try it\r\nup-hill. It will not be long before these muscles will ache till it will\r\nseem as if you must have a whole gymnasium concealed in them somewhere.\r\n\r\nAnother exercise for the same muscles, which can also be learned in a\r\nmoment, and a little of which will suffice at first, is running on the\r\ntoes, or, rather, on the soles and toes. Here the whole weight is held\r\nby, and pushed from, first the muscles of one calf, then of the other.\r\nOne will not go far at this without convincing proof of the value of\r\nthis work to the parts in question.\r\n\r\nOf two brothers of our acquaintance--one a boy of thirteen, the other a\r\nlittle fellow of four--the former walks with no especial spring, and\r\nperforms his running flat-footed. But the little fellow, whether\r\nwalking, standing, or running, is forever on his toes, and with his\r\nknees sprung well back. The former has rather slim legs and no great\r\ncalf; the latter beautifully developed calves, round, full, and\r\nsymmetrical, noticeably large for a boy of his size and age.\r\n\r\nAgain, work, harder, and telling more directly on the calves, and hence\r\ncalculated to increase their size and strength faster even than any of\r\nthese, is hopping on one foot--a really grand exercise, and one of the\r\nspeediest for bringing strong legs and a springy step. There is not the\r\nrelief in it that there is in walking or running. There the rest is\r\nnearly twice as long as here. Here the work is almost continuous, and\r\nsoon tires the strongest muscles. Jumping also exercises these muscles\r\npowerfully, and, practised steadily, soon brings them up. Well developed\r\nand strong, these muscles are of great value in dancing, adding\r\nastonishingly to the ease and grace so valued in this accomplishment,\r\nand to endurance as well. Horseback-riding, where the foot is pushed but\r\na little way into the stirrup, and the whole weight thus thrown on the\r\ntoes; rowing, especially with the sliding seat, where the feet press\r\nhard against the stretcher; leaping; ordinary walking uphill, and\r\nwalking on the toes alone--these all call these muscles into most\r\nvigorous play, and, when practised steadily and with energy, are among\r\nthe most rapid means known for increasing, not the strength of the\r\ncalves alone, but their girth as well.\r\n\r\nTry a summer of mountain climbing. Look at the men who spend their lives\r\nat it. Notice the best stayers in the Alpine clubs, and almost\r\ninvariably they are found to have large and powerful calves, especially\r\nwhere their knees are not bent much in stepping. In a personal sketch of\r\nBendigo, the once celebrated British prize-fighter (now a quiet\r\nChristian man), much stress was laid on the fact that his calves\r\nmeasured a clean sixteen inches about. Yet, to show that gentlemen are\r\nsometimes quite as strong in given directions as prize-fighters, look at\r\nProfessor Maclaren's own memorandum of not only what a splendid pair of\r\nlegs he himself had at the start, but what a little mountain climbing\r\ndid for them; for he says that in four months of Alpine walking,\r\naveraging nine hours a day, his calves went up from sixteen inches to\r\nseventeen and a quarter! and his thighs from twenty-three and a half\r\ninches to twenty-five. If instances nearer home are sought, and yet\r\nwhere neither anything like the time Maclaren took was given to it, nor\r\nany of the very severe work of the gentleman referred to a little\r\nearlier, look at what Dr. Sargent accomplished, not with one solitary\r\nman but with two hundred, at Bowdoin College; not giving nine hours a\r\nday to it, but only \"half an hour a day, four times a week, for a\r\nperiod of six months.\" In this very brief time, and by moderate\r\nexercises, he increased the average girth of the calf of these whole\r\ntwo hundred men from twelve and a half inches to thirteen and a\r\nquarter. There was one pupil, working four hours a week instead of\r\nfour half-hours, and for one year instead of six months, who increased\r\nhis calves from thirteen and a half inches to fifteen--an actual gain\r\nof a quarter of an inch more in two hundred and eight hours of\r\nexercise, much of which was given to other muscles, and did not tell\r\non the calves, than Maclaren made in nine hundred hours of work, most\r\nof which kept these muscles in very active play.\r\n\r\nIn all exercises for these muscles, indeed in all foot-work, shoes\r\nshould be worn with soles broad enough to prevent the slightest cramping\r\nof the foot, and so giving every part of it its natural play.\r\n\r\nThere remains one other prominent muscle below the knee, that in front,\r\nrunning down along the outer side of the shin-bone. Develop the calf\r\nfully, as is often done, and omit this little muscle and the work which\r\ncalls it into play, and there is something wanting, something the lack\r\nof which causes a lack of symmetry. Fast walking, when one is unused to\r\nit, especially when the knees are held pretty straight, will work this\r\nmuscle so vigorously as to make it sore. But a plain, safe, and simple\r\nexercise for it, yet one which, if protracted, will soon swell it into\r\nnotice, and give it unwonted strength and beauty, is effected by\r\nstooping down as low as possible, the feet being but a few inches apart,\r\nand the heels never being allowed to rise even a quarter of an inch off\r\nthe floor. Lift the heels, and this muscle is at once relieved.\r\n\r\nLaying any weight on the foot, and lifting it clear from the ground,\r\nwill also call on this muscle. So will fastening the feet into straps,\r\nlike those on a boat-stretcher or rowing-weight, and swaying the body of\r\nthe sitter back and forth; for these muscles have heavy work to do to\r\naid in pulling the body forward, so that the rower may reach his hands\r\nout over his toes for a new stroke. Simply standing on one foot, first\r\nholding the other clear of the floor, and then drawing it up as near as\r\npossible to the front of its own ankle, and then opening it as wide as\r\nyou can, will be found a safe and reasonably effective way of bringing\r\nforward this small but useful muscle; while walking on the heels, with\r\nthe toes drawn up high, is simpler yet. For those who want to run heavy\r\nrisks, and are not contented with any exercise which does not threaten\r\ntheir necks, hanging by the toes from a horizontal or trapeze bar will\r\nbe found to just fill the bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Work for the Front of the Thigh._\r\n\r\nThe muscles of the front thigh have a most intimate connection with\r\nthose already mentioned, and, for ordinary purposes, a fair development\r\nof them is more necessary than of those below the knee. In common\r\nwalking, for instance, while the calf gets something to do, the thigh\r\ngets far more, especially when the step is low and flat, and the heel\r\nnever raised far from the ground. A man will often have large and strong\r\nthighs, and yet but indifferent calves. A prominent Harvard oarsman, a\r\nstrong and fast walker, and a man of magnificent development in most\r\npoints, was once examined carefully by Greenough, the sculptor. \"I\r\nshould know you were an American,\" said he, \"because you have no\r\ncalves;\" and, indeed, his mistake in developing splendid arms, and\r\ntrunk, and thighs, and forgetting all about the calves, is far too\r\ncommon a one among our athletes to-day; though the prominence they are\r\nbeginning to give to running helps mend matters in this respect.\r\n\r\nScarcely any muscles are easier brought into action than these of the\r\nupper or front thigh. Stand erect, with head and chest high, and the\r\nfeet about six inches apart. Now, bend the knees a little, say until the\r\nhead has dropped vertically six inches. Then rise to the perpendicular\r\nagain. Repeat a few times, and it will not be long till these muscles\r\nwill be felt to be in lively action, and this exercise prolonged will\r\nmake them ache. But this movement is very much akin to that in dancing,\r\nthe latter being the harder of the two, because the weight is first on\r\none foot, then on the other, while in the former it is always on both.\r\n\r\nAgain, instead of stooping for a few inches only, start as before, with\r\nhead and neck rigidly erect, and now stoop all the way down; then rise\r\nagain. Continue this movement several times, and generally at first a\r\nfew repetitions will be found to be quite enough. By-and-by, as the\r\nstrength increases, so should the number; and, if time is to be saved\r\nand the work condensed, keep dumb-bells, say of a tenth of your own\r\nweight, in the hands during the operation.\r\n\r\nA more severe tax yet is had by holding one foot far out, either in\r\nfront or back, and then stooping down wholly on the other foot. Few\r\ncan do this many times, and most persons cannot do it at all. For\r\nswiftly bringing up a thigh at present weaker than its mate, and\r\nso restoring the symmetry which should always have been there, this\r\nwork is almost unparalleled.\r\n\r\nJumping itself, either high or flat, is admirable for the thighs.\r\nCharles Astor Bristed, in his \"Five Years in an English University,\"\r\nsays that he at one time took to jumping, and was astounded at the\r\nrapid progress he made in a branch of athletics at which before he\r\nhad been no good. Maclaren says that hardly any work will quicker\r\nbring up the whole legs; but this will probably prove truer where a\r\nlarge number of moderate jumps are taken daily, than where a few\r\nextreme efforts are made.\r\n\r\nBoth fast walking and running bring vigorous action to these muscles;\r\nslow walking does little for them, hence the number of weak, undeveloped\r\nthighs among men who do little or no quick foot-work. A man, too, whose\r\nbody is light and thin, may do a deal of fast walking without greatly\r\nenlarging his thighs, because they have comparatively little to carry.\r\nBut let him, after first getting thoroughly used to fast and continued\r\nwalking, carry weight awhile, say a twenty-five-pound bag of shot or\r\nsand, or a small boy, on his back, or dumb-bells in his hands--of\r\ncourse, on a gymnasium track, or some other course where his action will\r\nbe understood--and he will find that the new work will soon tell, as\r\nwould, also, long-distance running, even though not weighted, as\r\nRowell so eminently shows.\r\n\r\nGood, stiff long-distance walking is excellent for the front thigh; but\r\nrunning is better, especially when done as it ought to be, namely, not\r\nflat-footed, but with the heel never touching the ground. Any sort of\r\nrunning or walking, at any pace protracted enough to bring moderately\r\ntired muscles, will tell, especially on these in question; while severe\r\nwork over a long distance will give them a great task, and the\r\nconsequent ability and size. Many a man may do a little desultory\r\nrunning daily, perhaps for a week or two together once a year, and not\r\nfind his thighs enlarge or toughen materially. But let him put in a few\r\nminutes each day, for several months together, at steady smart running,\r\nas far as he can, and go comfortably, and now, besides the work becoming\r\neasy, comes the desired size and strength as well. The hopping, which\r\nwas so good for the calves, is hardly less so for these muscles, and is\r\none of the best possible movements to develop them in the shortest time.\r\n\r\nDancing, long continued, also tells here, as an acquaintance of ours\r\nfound, who used to lead the German frequently at Newport; for, though\r\nfar from being an athlete, he said that he daily ran a mile during\r\nthe season, just to keep his legs in good order for the duties\r\nhis position demanded.\r\n\r\nA more moderate exercise than the running, though not always so\r\navailable, is walking uphill. This, besides, as already mentioned, doing\r\nso much for the calves, tells directly and markedly on the thighs as\r\nwell. Skating makes a pleasant substitute for walking during a part of\r\nthe colder months, and, when much distance is covered daily, brings\r\nstrong and shapely thighs.\r\n\r\nThe farmer and the laboring man, in all their heavier work done stooping\r\nover their tasks--such as lifting, shovelling, picking, and mowing--use\r\nthe thighs much, but keep them so long fixed in one position, with\r\nlittle or no varying exercise to supple and limber them and the joints,\r\nthat both gradually stiffen, and their instep soon begins to lack\r\nelasticity, which tendency is too often increased by heavy, stiff,\r\nand unwieldy boots.\r\n\r\nSwinging forward when rowing, either in a boat or at the toe-straps,\r\nafter first swinging far back, takes these upper muscles in a way quite\r\nthe reverse of their ordinary use, they now aiding to pull the whole\r\ntrunk forward, and so acting like two long hooks.\r\n\r\nAll lifting of heavy objects from the ground, standing in almost any\r\nposition, tells heavily on these muscles, being about the severest\r\nmomentary test they can have, greater even than in jumping. But\r\noccasional heavy lifting tends rather to harden the muscle than to\r\nrapidly increase its size, protracted effort at lighter but good-sized\r\nweights doing the latter to better advantage.\r\n\r\nBrisk horseback-riding keeps these muscles very actively employed.\r\nEvery sort of work which calls for frequent stooping down does the\r\nsame. Persons who take short steps, and many of them, if they walk\r\nwith vigor, are likely to have legs thicker and stouter everywhere\r\nthan they who stride out far, but make the whole step as easy for\r\nthemselves as possible.\r\n\r\nHardly any of the muscles are so useful and valuable as these. One may\r\nhave weak arms and trunk, yet with strong thighs he can walk a long\r\ndistance daily, and not be nearly so fatigued as those much stronger\r\nelsewhere and weaker here, and, as many men have little or no other\r\nexercise than walking, they are often contented with fair development\r\nhere, and practically none of any account elsewhere. It is astonishing,\r\ntoo, to notice how a man accustomed for years to a poor shambling sort\r\nof a gait will, with strict attention to taking a clean and strong step\r\nover a certain distance daily, with a determination to take no other\r\nsort of gait, soon improve the strength and shape of his thighs.\r\n\r\nAs hopping on one foot is a swift way to develop the calf, so frequent\r\nstooping down as low as possible and rising again, daily, at first\r\nwithout weights, but eventually with them, is the sure way to speedily\r\nenlarge and strengthen the thighs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Enlarge the Under Thigh._\r\n\r\nThe muscles of the under thigh do not get nearly so much to do as those\r\nin front, in many persons seeming almost not to exist. A bad walk, with\r\nthe knees always slightly bent, is partly accountable for this; and a\r\nman accustomed to such a walk, and trying suddenly to walk erect, with\r\nhis knees firmly knit, and bowed slightly back, soon tires and aches\r\nat the operation, which, to one in the habit of walking erect, long\r\nago became natural.\r\n\r\nThe exercise already recommended, of pressing the sole of the foot hard\r\non the ground just as it leaves it, is scarcely more beneficial to the\r\nmuscles of the calf than to these; likewise walking uphill, that telling\r\nfinely on them. Standing, as does the West Pointer in his setting-up\r\ndrill, and, with knees unbent, trying to touch the floor with the hands,\r\ntells in this region. Fastening a weight of any sort, a dumb-bell or\r\nflat-iron, to the ankle, say with strap or towel, and raising the foot\r\nas high up backward and outward as possible, and repeating till tired;\r\nputting the foot in the handle of the pulling-weight, and frequently\r\ndrawing it far down; or, standing with back to the wall, and placing\r\nthe heel against the base-board of the room, or any solid vertical\r\nsurface, and pressing hard many times--these all tell on this hidden\r\nunder muscle, which, small as it is, is a most essential one, and\r\nespecially in looks, while running with the foot thrown high behind,\r\nexcels them all.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Strengthen the Sides of the Waist._\r\n\r\nBut while the legs have been so actively engaged, there are other parts\r\nwhich have not been idle, so that the same work brings other strength as\r\nwell. In every step taken, and especially every vigorous one, as in fast\r\nwalking or in running, the muscles at the sides of the waist have been\r\nall the time at work, a prominent duty of theirs being to aid in holding\r\nthe body erect.\r\n\r\nNotice a man weak just here, and see his body sway a little from side to\r\nside as he walks, seeming to give at the waist. Were such a one to\r\npractise daily hopping straight ahead, on one foot, and then on the\r\nother, until he could by-and-by so cover half a mile without fatigue, he\r\nwould find his swaying propensity fast disappearing; and if he has been\r\ntroubled with a feeble or unshapely waist, that also will have gradually\r\nchanged, until at the end it has become firm and well-set.\r\n\r\nTake the long balancing-pole of the tight-rope walker, and try to walk a\r\nrope awhile, or try the more simple expedient of walking on the railroad\r\nrail, and these muscles are at once uncommonly busy. Notice the\r\nprofessional tight-rope man, and see how strong he is here, especially\r\nwhen to the weight of his own body he adds another, as did Farini when\r\nhe carried a man on his shoulders across the Niagara River; or as the\r\nEastern porter, with his huge weight of luggage; or the carrier at the\r\nmeat-market, who shoulders a whole side or more of beef and marches off\r\nwith it. These men soon get great and unusual power in these side\r\nmuscles. Wrestling also, whether Cornish or Graeco-Roman, or indeed\r\nalmost any sort, tells directly and severely here. If one prefers\r\nto use apparatus made specially, the opposite cut shows a simple\r\ndevice of Dr. Sargent's, which he made purposely to bring up and\r\nstrengthen these muscles.\r\n\r\nStanding in front of it, with head and neck erect and chest out, and\r\ngrasping the ends of the bar A A', the operator simply turns it, first\r\nwell up to the right, then to the left, and then repeats the movements\r\nuntil he has enough. As he turns, the rubber straps B B stretch more and\r\nmore, of course getting stiffer the farther the bar is turned. It would\r\nscarcely be possible to hit upon a better appliance for improving\r\nthese valuable side muscles, and yet without fear of overdoing them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. Appliance for developing the Sides of the Waist.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Abdominal Muscles._\r\n\r\nNor do these include all the muscles which the foot-work arouses to\r\naction. Take the horizontal bands or layers of muscle across the\r\nabdomen. Every step forward moves them, and the higher and more\r\nenergetic the step, the more they have to do. A man who is not strong in\r\nthese muscles will usually have a feeble walk, and very often will\r\ndouble forward a little, until he is in about the position of the two\r\nhands of a clock at two minutes past six, giving him the appearance of\r\nbeing weak here. But the strong, high step tilts the body slightly back,\r\nand gives these muscles so much to do that they soon grow good at it,\r\nand shapely and powerful accordingly.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage comes from having these muscles strong, and from\r\nforming the habit of stepping as he does who has them so. By walking\r\nthus erect, the shoulders, instead of pressing over on the chest as the\r\nman tires, and so cramping his breathing, are so habitually held back\r\nthat it is easier to keep them there, and the consequent fuller\r\nrespiration keeps him longer fresh. This is very conspicuous in the case\r\nof one of the most famous pedestrians in the world to-day, its\r\nex-champion long-distance walker, Daniel O'Leary. Take him when in good\r\ncondition, and in one of his long tramps; on the first mile or the four\r\nhundredth, it is always the same: there he is, with head up, shoulders\r\nwell back, and working busily, and--the most noticeable thing--the whole\r\ncentre of the body, from the waist to the knees, thrown, if anything,\r\nactually forward of a vertical line, instead of as far, or often much\r\nfarther, back of it; indeed, the point farthest forward is about two\r\ninches below his belt. A fair though not clear idea of what is meant can\r\nbe had from the following sketch of him, taken at the time, on the\r\nlatter part of his five-hundred-mile walk with Hughes, \"the Lepper,\" on\r\nthe track in the Hippodrome, in New York city, during the first week of\r\nOctober, 1878. Hughes, while proving himself a very tough and determined\r\nman, showed, as is too often the case with professional athletes,\r\ngreat ignorance of many things which would have helped him much had\r\nhe known and followed them, and none more, perhaps, than this very\r\nmatter of correct position.\r\n\r\nO'Leary's freshness, no matter how many hundred miles he has just\r\nwalked, is remarkable. This rational way of carrying the body during a\r\ndifficult feat, besides giving the heart and lungs full room for\r\nvigorous action, also gives the stomach and other vital organs ample\r\nplay; for a glance at the sketch shows none of the thinness of flank\r\nand general sunken-in look at the waist in O'Leary so plain in Hughes,\r\nand so common among walkers in the later miles of the race.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. A Correct Position for Fast Walking.]\r\n\r\nSingularly enough, a little boy, only eleven years old, and but three\r\nfeet nine inches high, has copied, or rather acquired--for it seems he\r\nhad never seen this sensible step and carriage of O'Leary--with\r\nastonishing success, as witness the following sketch of his performance\r\nfrom the _New York Herald_ of October 11th, 1878. Foolish in the extreme\r\nas it is to allow such half-grown youngsters to attempt such feats, it\r\nis doubtful if the annals of the cinder-path can match such prodigious\r\nstay and skill in one so young:\r\n\r\n   \"AN EMBRYO O'LEARY\r\n\r\n   \"Between the Grand Central Depot and Madison Avenue and\r\n   Forty-second and Forty-fourth streets is a vacant square, which the\r\n   boys of the neighborhood have been utilizing as a race-track. Every\r\n   day dozens of them may be seen scurrying round the track, intent on\r\n   making the best time ever known. Yesterday afternoon a five-mile\r\n   walk was in progress, which was headed by a very small boy, who at\r\n   once attracted the attention of the by-standers by his peculiarly\r\n   rapid and easy gait. He kept ahead of the other contestants, and\r\n   finally distanced them by two laps, and won in the time of 48m. 2s.\r\n\r\n   \"After this race, at the request of the lookers-on, he travelled\r\n   around the track once (which is one-seventh of a mile) in 1m. and\r\n   15s. _He walks very erect, steps like O'Leary, and does not seem to\r\n   be easily fatigued._ This time is still more surprising,\r\n   considering that he is only eleven years old and but three feet\r\n   nine inches high, so that he cannot take a very long step.\r\n\r\n   \"In a conversation with him it was learned that his name was Joe\r\n   Havey, residing at No. 144 East Forty-third Street. He has never\r\n   seen a professional walk, so that his walking ideas are his own.\r\n   With a little practice he bids fair to become a No. 1 pedestrian.\"\r\n\r\nBut there are other ways of bringing up these useful abdominal muscles,\r\nequally easy to learn.\r\n\r\nSit down at the rowing-weights, placing the feet in the toe-straps. Now\r\nsway the body back and forth, and, placing the hand on the muscles in\r\nquestion, feel how they harden. An ordinary bit of strap screwed to the\r\nbase-board of one's room, so that each foot shall have a loop of it to\r\ngo into, and then a stool or cassock some eight inches high to sit on,\r\nsave the expense of the rowing-weights, yet produce the desired result\r\nwith these muscles.\r\n\r\nLie flat on the back, as, for instance, just on awaking. Taking first a\r\ndeep, full breath, draw the feet upward, keeping the knees unbent, until\r\nthe legs are vertical. Lower them slowly till horizontal, then raise\r\nagain and continue. It will not take many minutes--or seconds--to bring\r\nthese muscles enough work for one morning.\r\n\r\nOr this time keep the legs down, and, first filling the chest, now draw\r\nthe body up until you are sitting erect. Then drop slowly back, and\r\nrepeat. This will be likely to take even less time than did the other,\r\nbut it will tell tremendously on these muscles. Indeed, most people are\r\nso weak in them, that they can hardly do this once. Yet men who have\r\nthem strong and well-trained will lie flat on their backs on the floor\r\nor gymnasium mat, and while some one holds their ankles, taking a\r\ntwo-hundred-pound man, lying across their chest at right angles with it,\r\nwill raise him several times till they are in erect sitting posture.\r\n\r\nSitting on one of the parallel bars in the gymnasium, and placing both\r\nfeet under the other, and now dropping the body back until it is\r\nhorizontal, then rising to vertical and repeating, is very hard work\r\nfor these abdominal muscles, and should only be practised by those\r\nalready strong here.\r\n\r\nThese muscles are brought into direct and vigorous play in rowing,\r\nto such an extent that no man who has them weak can be a fast oarsman\r\nover any ordinary racing distance. Indeed, this is the very region\r\nwhere young rowers, otherwise strong, and seemingly fit for hard,\r\nfast work, give out first.\r\n\r\nEvery time the foot is raised in running, these muscles are called to\r\nactive duty far more than in walking, and the high, strong, sharp step\r\nworks them severely, so that no man weak here could be a fast runner\r\nwith good action. Jumping, vaulting, leaping, all bring them into\r\nsudden, spasmodic, almost violent action. Let a man mow awhile, when\r\nunused to it, and see how soon it tells across this region, the muscles\r\naching next day from the twisting motion.\r\n\r\nThe latest invention purposely for these muscles is also one of\r\nSargent's, on the following plan: The pupil lies on the plank A A', or,\r\nrather, sits on it, when A' is a little back of vertical, so as, for\r\ninstance, to form with A the angle A B A'. With feet in the toe-straps\r\nC C', he sways gently forward and back as long as he can without\r\nfatigue. From day to day, as these muscles gain strength, A' is dropped\r\nlower and lower, until finally it is on a level with A. Or a strap may\r\nbe placed over the forehead and fastened to A', and, with the feet in\r\nthe toe-straps, the person may lift his body up till vertical, drawing\r\nthe weight E with him as he rises.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Counterwork for the Abdominal Muscles._\r\n\r\nBut nearly all the exercises just named for the abdominal muscles, while\r\nthey make them strong and handsome, tend to contract rather than\r\nlengthen them; and for men of sedentary life inclined to stoop a little\r\nforward while sitting, some work is needed which shall stretch these\r\nmuscles, and aid in restoring them to their natural length.\r\n\r\nStand erect. Now gradually draw the head and shoulders backward until as\r\nfar past the vertical as possible. Return slowly to erect position. In\r\nthe drawing back, these muscles were stretched to a greater length than\r\nusual, and in those who accustom themselves to drawing far back in\r\nthis way, like the contortionists of the circus, these muscles grow\r\nwonderfully elastic, such men being able not only to touch their heads\r\nto their heels, but now and then to go farther yet, and drink water from\r\na tumbler set between their feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. Device for developing the Abdominal Muscles.]\r\n\r\nBut while there is no need of such extreme work, moderate performance in\r\nthis way directly tends to stretch and lengthen muscles which, in the\r\ngreat majority of people, are somewhat cramped and shortened by habitual\r\nstanding, sitting, or lying, with the back either flat or almost curved\r\noutward, instead of slightly hollowed in, and with the consequent\r\nsinking of the chest. All work above the head, such as swinging clubs,\r\nor an axe or sledge; putting up dumb-bells, especially when both hands\r\ngo up together; swinging by the hands from rope or bar, or pulling the\r\nbody up till the chin touches the hands; standing with back to the\r\npulley-weights, and taking the handles in the hands, and, starting with\r\nthem high over the head, then pushing the hands far out forward;\r\nstanding two or more feet from the wall, and, placing the hands side by\r\nside against it about as high up as your shoulders, then throwing the\r\nchest as far forward as possible; the hauling down ropes by the sailor;\r\nthe ceiling-work of the plasterer and the painter, and the like--these\r\nall do excellent service in bringing to these important muscles the\r\nlength and elasticity they ought to have, and so contributing materially\r\nto the erect carriage of the body. All kinds of pushing with the hands,\r\nsuch as one does in putting them against any heavy substance and trying\r\nto push it before him, striking out in boxing, in fencing, or\r\nsingle-stick, with dumb-bells, or in swimming, are capital; while the\r\ndrawing of the head and shoulders back swiftly, as in boxing to avoid a\r\nblow, can hardly be surpassed as an aid in this direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To enlarge and give Power to the Loins._\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the waist, there is one more set of muscles which demand\r\nattention; and if one has them weak, no matter how strong he may be\r\nelsewhere, he is weak in a place where he can ill afford to be, and that\r\nis in the loins, or the main muscles in the small of the back, running\r\nup and down at each side of the spine. In many of the heavier grades of\r\nmanual labor these muscles have a large share of work to do. All\r\nstooping over, when lifting is done with a spade, or fork, or bar,\r\nwhether the knees are held straight or bent, or lifting any weight\r\ndirectly in the hands, horizontal pulling on a pulley-weight, rope, or\r\noar--in short, nearly every sort of work where the back is actively\r\nemployed, keeps these muscles thoroughly active. You cannot bend over\r\nwithout using them. Weed awhile, and, unless already strong in the\r\nloins, they will ache.\r\n\r\nA laboring man weak here would hardly be worth hiring. A rowing-man\r\nweak here could never be a first-rate oar till he had trained away\r\nthe weakness. Heenan, with all his grand physique, his tremendous\r\nstriking-power, his massive development above the waist, would not\r\nhave made nearly as enduring an oar as the sturdier, barrel-chested\r\nMorrissey, or as the broad-loined Renforth did make. Strong loins\r\nare always desirable. He who has them, and is called on in any sudden\r\nemergency to lift any heavy weight, as the prostrate form of one\r\nwho has fallen in a swoon, for instance, is far less likely to work\r\nhimself serious, if not permanent, injury here than he who has them\r\nuntrained and undeveloped.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Development above the Waist._\r\n\r\nLittle or no work has been suggested, so far, aimed purposely to develop\r\nany muscles above the waist. Indeed, it is no uncommon thing, especially\r\namong Englishmen, to find a man of very strong legs and waist, yet with\r\nbut an indifferent chest and shoulders, and positively poor arms. Canon\r\nKingsley had discovered this when he said to the British clergy, \"I\r\nshould be ashamed of being weak. I could not do half the little good\r\nI do here if it were not for that strength and activity which some\r\nconsider coarse and degrading. Many clergymen would half kill\r\nthemselves if they did what I do. And though they might walk about\r\nas much, they would neglect exercise of the arms and chest, and\r\nbecome dyspeptic or consumptive.\"\r\n\r\nLet us look at a few things which would have proved useful to the brave\r\ncanon's pupils. The connection between the arms and the muscles, both on\r\nthe front and back of the chest, is so close that it is practically\r\nimpossible to have arms thoroughly developed, and not have all the trunk\r\nmuscles above the waist equally so. Fortunately, as in foot-work, the\r\nexercises to develop these muscles, without having to resort to\r\nexpensive apparatus, or often to any at all, are very numerous.\r\n\r\nWith a pair of dumb-bells, at first weighing not over one-twenty-fifth\r\nof what he or she does who uses them, and gradually, as the strength\r\nincreases, substituting larger ones, until they weigh, say, one-tenth\r\nof his or her weight, there is scarcely a muscle above the belt\r\nwhich cannot, by steady and systematic work of never over half an\r\nhour daily, be rounded and strengthened up to what it ought to be\r\nin a thoroughly developed, strong, and efficient person of its\r\nowner's sex, size, and age.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Filling out the Shoulders and Upper Back._\r\n\r\nNotice now what these dumb-bells can do for the shoulders and\r\nupper back.\r\n\r\nStand erect again, with the chin up and chest high (in all these\r\nexercises stand erect where it is possible), and have the dumb-bells in\r\nthe hands hanging easily at the sides. Now carry them slowly backward\r\nand upward, keeping the arms straight at the elbows, and parallel, until\r\nthe hands are about as high as they can well go. Hold them there a\r\nmoment, then drop them slowly to the sides. Do it again, and keep on\r\nuntil you begin to feel like stopping. Note the spot where you feel it,\r\nand you will find that the under or inner muscles of the part of the\r\nback-arm which is above the elbow, also those on the shoulder-blade, and\r\nthe large muscles of the back directly under the arms, have been the\r\nones in action. Laying one dumb-bell down, now repeat the above exercise\r\nwith the remaining one, say in the right hand, this time placing the\r\nleft hand on the back just under the right arm, or on the inner portion\r\nof the triceps or upper muscle of that right arm. These muscles will be\r\nfound vigorously at work, and hardening more and more the higher the\r\nbell is carried or the longer it is held up.\r\n\r\nA little of this work daily, begun with the lighter dumb-bells, and\r\nincreased gradually by adding to the number of strokes, or taking larger\r\nbells, or both, and long before the year is out, if the person is steady\r\nand persevering at it, decided increase in the strength, size, and\r\nshapeliness of the upper back will follow.\r\n\r\nWhat has been thus done with the dumb-bells could have been done nearly\r\nor quite as well with any other small, compact body of the same weight\r\nwhich could be easily grasped by the hands, such as a pair of\r\nwindow-weights, flat-irons, cobble-stones, or even chairs, whichever\r\nwere convenient. Where there's a will there's a way; and if one really\r\nmeans to get these or any other muscles strong and handsome, the way is\r\nreally surprisingly simple and easy.\r\n\r\nNow, instead of using the dumb-bells, stand erect, facing the\r\npulley-weights at the gymnasium, or at home if you have them, taking\r\ncare only that they weigh at least what the dumb-bells would.\r\nGrasping the handles, draw them far back and up, the hands, in\r\nother words, doing precisely what they did with the bells, and\r\nthe same results will follow.\r\n\r\nRowing, either at the oar or the rowing-weights, would have told equally\r\nhard on these muscles, and, as already pointed out, on many others\r\nbesides, the weight of the body itself aiding the development as it\r\nwould not with the bells or weights. It would also broaden the shoulders\r\nand spread them apart, more, perhaps, than almost any other known\r\nexercise. But, like any other single exercise calling certain muscles\r\ninto play and leaving others idle, taken as substantially one's only\r\nexercise, as is too often the case with rowing-men, it brings a partial\r\nand one-sided development, making the parts used look too large for the\r\nrest, the fact being that the rest have not been brought up as fast as\r\nthe former. Unless one's chest is unusually broad and strong, and often,\r\neven if it is, constant rowing warps his shoulders forward, and tends\r\ndirectly to make him a round-shouldered man,[M] while the upper arm, or\r\nthat part above the elbow, has had practically no development, the inner\r\npart of the triceps or back-arm alone being called to severe duty, but\r\nthe bulk being almost idle. Courtney, the greatest sculler the United\r\nStates has yet produced--a large man, standing six feet and half an inch\r\nin height, strongly made in most parts, and weighing ordinarily nearly a\r\nhundred and ninety--is a good instance of how rowing does little for the\r\nupper arm; for while his forearm is almost massive, measuring exactly\r\nthirteen inches in girth, the upper arm, doubled up, barely reaches\r\nfourteen. A well-proportioned arm, of which the forearm girths thirteen,\r\nshould measure above all fifteen and a quarter. Again, while Courtney's\r\nforearm feels sinewy and hard, the upper is not nearly so hard, and\r\ndoes not give the impression of having seen very stiff service.\r\nHis chest, too, is not so large by over two inches as ought to go\r\nwith a thirteen-inch forearm.\r\n\r\nBeside these exercises with the dumb-bells, the weights, and the oar,\r\nall the vocations which cause one to stoop over much and lift--such as\r\nmost of those of the farmer, the laborer, and of the artisan in the\r\nheavier kinds of work--tell on these same muscles of the upper back and\r\nthe inner side of the triceps, too often bringing, as already pointed\r\nout, a far better back than front, and so injuring the form and\r\ncarriage. Lifting heavy weights where one stands nearly erect, as when\r\npractising on the lifting-machine, pulls very heavily on the extreme\r\nupper muscles of the back, those sloping off downward from the back of\r\nthe neck to the shoulders.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To obtain a good Biceps._\r\n\r\nStarting with the dumb-bells down at the sides, as before, raise them\r\nslowly and steadily in front until they nearly touch the\r\nshoulder--technically, \"curl\" them--holding the head up, the neck\r\nrigidly erect, and the chest expanded to its very utmost. Now lower the\r\nbells slowly to the sides again, and repeat, and so continue. In a very\r\nfew minutes, often less than three, you will want to stop. The biceps\r\nmuscles, or those forming the front of the upper arms, are getting the\r\nwork this time, and by applying to that of one arm in action the hand of\r\nthe other, it is at once found that this muscle is growing quite hard.\r\n\r\nIf no dumb-bell or other convenient weight is at hand, place one hand in\r\nthe other, and bear down hard with the upper hand, holding the chest\r\nstubbornly out. Lift away with the lower hand, and, when it reaches the\r\nshoulder, lower it slowly to the side, and then raise again, and so\r\ncontinue. This will be found a good thing to know when a person is\r\ntravelling, or away from home, and cannot readily get at such apparatus\r\nas he has in his own room.\r\n\r\nNow stand erect in front of and facing the pulley-weights, and at about\r\narm's-length from them; draw the hand horizontally in until it is close\r\nto the shoulder; let the weight drop slowly back, and then draw it to\r\nyou again, and so go on. This is splendid work for the biceps, and will\r\nsoon begin to swell and strengthen it; and then either increased weight,\r\nor more strokes daily, is all that will be needed.\r\n\r\nFasten a stout hook in a beam overhead, and hang a pulley to it. Run a\r\nrope through this, at one end of which you can attach weights, and tie\r\nthe other to the middle of a thick cane or other stick, taking care to\r\nhave the rope of such a length in all, that when the weight is on the\r\nfloor the stick is about a foot above your head.\r\n\r\nBegin with, say, one of your dumb-bells of not over one-tenth of your\r\nown weight. Grasping the stick with both hands, with their palms toward\r\nyou, draw it downward until level with your chin; then let it go back;\r\nrepeat, and continue till you begin to tire. If the single bell seems\r\ntoo light, attach both bells. After a few days with these, fasten on a\r\nbasket or coal-hod, and increase the load until, say at the month's end,\r\nit weighs over half of what you do. If you can take this up a number of\r\ntimes without ache or ill-feeling, you are strong enough to take hold of\r\na fixed bar and attempt to haul yourself up, as Mr. Bryant did,[N] until\r\nyour chin touches your hand. But without this preliminary work, such\r\npulling up, frequently as it is attempted, is a foolish and hazardous\r\nexperiment, throwing a great strain on muscles quite unused to such a\r\ntask, namely, on these very biceps muscles.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, one has these muscles already strong, and can\r\nwith ease pull himself up six or eight times, he will find this stick\r\nand weight an excellent affair for training the biceps of one arm,\r\nuntil it gets strong enough to pull him up without the other arm at\r\nall. For this simple and valuable contrivance the public is also\r\nindebted to Dr. Sargent, who is a regular Edison in devising simple\r\nand sensible gymnastic appliances, which he freely gives to all\r\nwithout patenting them.\r\n\r\nMounting a ladder or a rope hand-over-hand; lifting any weight in\r\nfront of you, whether a feather or a barrel of sugar; picking up\r\nanything from the floor; holding weights out in front, or at your\r\nside, at arm's-length; pulling downward on a rope, as in hauling\r\nup a sail; hammering--in short, anything which bends the elbow and\r\ndraws the hand in toward the shoulder, takes the biceps muscle;\r\nand, if the work is vigorous and persisted in, this muscle will\r\nere long become strong and well-shaped.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To bring up the Muscles on the Front and Side of the Shoulder._\r\n\r\nFor the muscles on the front and side of the shoulder, holding out\r\nweights at arm's-length, either at the side or in front, will be found\r\njust what is wanted, the arms being horizontal, or the hands being held\r\nrather higher than that, the elbows remaining unbent. Holding the mere\r\nweight of the hands, as in boxing, but keeping at it awhile, keeps these\r\nparts well occupied; while the sword, or foil, or single-stick, freely\r\nplied, or the axe or bat, tell directly here.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Forearm Work._\r\n\r\nVery many of these exercises for the biceps and shoulder have also\r\ncalled on the forearm, while those mentioned for the inner triceps have\r\ndone the same. Very prominent among the latter is rowing, much of it\r\nsoon bringing a strong forearm, especially on the inner and under side.\r\nAnything which necessitates shutting the hand, or keeping it partly or\r\nwholly shut; such as holding anything heavy in it, driving, chopping,\r\nfencing, single-stick, pulling one's self up with one hand or both,\r\nbatting, lacrosse, polo, twisting the dumb-bells around when at\r\narm's-length, or a chair, or cane, or foil, or sword, or broom-handle,\r\nif the dumb-bells are not convenient, carrying a weight in the hand,\r\nusing any of the heavier mechanical hand-tools--all these, and more of\r\ntheir sort, will enlarge and strengthen the forearm, and will do much\r\nalso for the hand. Probably the hardest work for the forearm, and that\r\ncalling for the greatest strength here, is lifting very heavy weights\r\nsuspended from a stick, bar, or handles which the hands grasp.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Exercises for the Triceps Muscles._\r\n\r\nOne prominent part of the arm remains, or, rather, one which ought to be\r\nprominent, though in most persons, both men and women, it is not. In\r\nboys and girls it is even less so. We refer to the rest of the triceps,\r\nor the bulk of what remains of the upper arm after leaving out the\r\nbiceps and the inner side of the triceps. When well developed, this is\r\none of the handsomest parts of the arm. No arm will look slim which has\r\nthis muscle fully developed.\r\n\r\nTo bring that development, push with the hands against almost any heavy\r\nor solid thing you want to. If these muscles are small and weak, push\r\nthe dumb-bells up over your head as much as you can daily, till a\r\nmonth's work has given them a start. For two or three minutes each day\r\nduring that month, stand facing the wall, and about two feet from it.\r\nNow fall against it, or, rather, put your hands on it, about three feet\r\napart and as high as your ears, and let your body drop in toward the\r\nwall till your chest nearly touches it, your face being held up and\r\nback. Then push sharply back till your body is again erect, and continue\r\nthe movement. This exercise is as admirable as it is cheap.\r\n\r\nIf the triceps muscles are tolerably strong in the start, or in any case\r\nat the end of the month in which the last two exercises have been\r\npractised, try now a harder thing. Place the hands on the floor, hold\r\nthe body out at full length and rigid, or as nearly so as you can, and\r\npush, raising the body till the elbows are straight. Now bend the elbows\r\nand lower again, till the face nearly touches the floor, keeping the\r\nbody all the time as stiff and straight as possible, and then rise on\r\nstiff elbows again, and so on. If this is not hard enough work for the\r\nambitious aspirant for stout triceps, he can vary it by clapping his\r\nhands between the dips, just as his face is farthest from the floor,\r\nthough in such case it is sometimes well to have a nose accustomed\r\nto facing difficulty.\r\n\r\nSo far, in this work for the back-arm the hands at first held merely the\r\nweight of the dumb-bells; then, as they pressed against the wall, they\r\nhad to bear part of the weight of the body, but not a large part, as\r\nthat rested mainly on the feet. In the pushing from the floor the hands\r\nbore still more of it, but yet the feet had quite a share. Now try\r\nsomething where the hands and arms carry the entire weight of the body.\r\nGet up on the parallel bars, or on the bars in your door-jambs,[O] or,\r\nif no bars are convenient, place two stout chairs back to back, and\r\nthen draw them about eighteen or twenty inches apart, and, placing one\r\nhand on each, holding the arms straight, lift the feet off the floor.\r\nNow lower till the chin is level with the hands, or nearly so, and then\r\nrise till the arms are straight, and then dip again, and so on, the\r\nknees and feet of course never resting on anything. Now you have one of\r\nthe best known exercises for bringing quick development and good\r\nstrength to the triceps or back-arm. When by steady daily trial you have\r\ngradually increased the number until you can do twenty-five fair dips\r\nwithout great effort, you have strong triceps muscles, and, if you have\r\ntwo legs and a reasonably heavy body to lift, good-sized ones at that.\r\nMost of your friends cannot manage five dips respectably, many scarcely\r\none. But, lest you should feel too elated over your twenty-five, bear in\r\nmind that one gentleman in New York has accomplished over eighty without\r\nstopping, and this though he weighs upward of one hundred and eighty\r\npounds; and if a reasonably accurate idea of what sort of back-arms were\r\nnecessary for this marvellous feat, it may be had by observing the cut\r\non the cover of this book. With a forty-four inch chest, his upper arm\r\nmeasures thirteen and a half inches down (half an inch more than\r\nHeenan's), and sixteen up, though he is but five feet ten inches in\r\nheight, while Heenan stood four inches taller. He says that as surely as\r\nthe ability exists to make many dips, so surely will there be a large\r\nback-arm, and it was hard work that brought him his. Slim arms may push\r\nup heavy dumb-bells once or twice, but it takes thick ones for sustained\r\neffort at smaller, though good-sized ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Strengthen and Develop the Hand._\r\n\r\nVery many of the exercises so useful in strengthening the forearm were\r\nat the same time improving the grip of the hand. But an evil of so much\r\ngripping or drawing the hand together is that, unless there is an equal\r\namount of work to open and flatten it, it tends to become hooked. Notice\r\nthe rowing-man's hand, and the fingers nearly always, when at rest, are\r\ninclined to be doubled in, as if half clutching something; and very\r\noften, where they have seen years of rowing, their joints get so set\r\nthat the fingers cannot be bent back nearly as far as other people's.\r\nSome of the pushing exercises mentioned above for the triceps tend to\r\ncounteract this, notably that where the fingers or the flat of the hands\r\nare pressed against the wall. An admirable exercise in this direction\r\nis, when you practice the pushing up from the floor for the triceps, to\r\nonly touch the floor with the ends of the fingers and thumbs, never\r\nletting the palm of the hand touch it at all. This will soon help to\r\nrectify many a hand now rather cramped and contracted, besides bringing\r\nnew strength and shape to the fingers.\r\n\r\nTo make any particular finger strong, attach a strap to the bar referred\r\nto on page 235, and placing that finger in the strap begin with raising\r\na small weight from the floor until you have drawn your hand down to\r\nyour chin; then from day to day gradually increase both the weight and\r\nthe number, until, before a great while, you may find that you can raise\r\nan equivalent of your own weight. Now attach the strap to any stationary\r\nobject as high above your head as you can comfortably reach, say a\r\nhorizontal bar, and pull yourself up till your chin touches your hand.\r\nSome gymnasts can do this several times with the little finger.\r\n\r\nJust where the thumb joins the palm, and between it and the forefinger\r\non the back of the hand, is a muscle which, while at first usually\r\nsmall, can be developed and enlarged by any exercise which necessitates\r\npinching the ends of the thumb and forefinger together, such as carrying\r\na plate of metal or other thin but heavy substance between the finger\r\nand thumb. Harder work yet, calling on both this muscle and a number of\r\nothers of the hand, consists in catching two two-inch beams running\r\noverhead, as in the ceiling of a cellar, and about a foot and a half or\r\ntwo feet apart, and walking along, sustaining the whole weight by the\r\ngrip, first of one hand, then of the other. He who can do this has very\r\nunusual strength of fingers.\r\n\r\nFor improving the ordinary grip of the hand, simply taking a rubber ball\r\nin it, or a wad of any elastic material, and even of paper, and\r\nrepeatedly squeezing it, will soon tell. Simpler yet is it to just\r\npractice opening and shutting the hand firmly many times. An athletic\r\nfriend of ours says that the man of his whole acquaintance who has the\r\nstrongest grip got it just by practising this exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Enlarge and Strengthen the Front of the Chest._\r\n\r\nEvery one of the exercises for the biceps tells also on the pectoral\r\nmuscles, or those on the front of the upper part of the chest, for the\r\ntwo work so intimately together that he who has a large biceps is\r\npractically sure to have the adjoining pectoral correspondingly large.\r\n\r\nBut there is other work which tells on them besides biceps work.\r\nWhenever the hands push hard against anything, and so call the triceps\r\nmuscles into action, these muscles at once combine with them. In the\r\nmore severe triceps work, such as the dips, the strain across these\r\nchest-muscles is very great, for they are then a very important factor\r\nin helping to hold up the weight of the whole body. This fact suggests\r\nthe folly of letting any one try so severe a thing as a dip, when his\r\ntriceps and pectoral muscles have not been used to any such heavy work.\r\nMany a person who has rashly attempted this has had to pay for it with a\r\npain for several days at the edge of the pectoral, where it meets the\r\nbreastbone, until he concluded he must have broken something.\r\n\r\nWorking with the dumb-bells when the arms are extended at right angles\r\nwith the body, like a cross, and raising them up and down for a foot or\r\nso, is one of the best things for the upper edge of the pectorals, or\r\nthat part next to the collar-bone.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to a matter of great importance, and one often\r\noverlooked. Whoever knows many gymnasts, and has seen them, stripped or\r\nin exercising costume, must occasionally have observed that, while they\r\nhad worked at exercises which brought up these pectoral muscles until\r\nthey were almost huge, their chests under their muscles had somehow not\r\nadvanced accordingly. Indeed, in more than one instance which has come\r\nunder our observation, the man looked as though, should you scrape all\r\nthese great muscles completely off, leaving the bare framework, he would\r\nhave actually a small chest, much smaller than many a fellow who had not\r\nmuch muscle. There hangs to-day--or did some time since--on the wall of\r\na well-known New York gymnasium, a portrait of a gymnast stripped above\r\nthe waist, which shows an exact case in point. The face of such a man is\r\noften a weak one, lacking the strength of cheek-bone and jaw so usual in\r\nmen of great vitality and sturdiness--like Morrissey, for instance--and\r\nthere is a general look about it as if the man lacked vitality. Many a\r\ngymnast has this appearance, for he takes so much severe muscular work\r\nthat it draws from his vitality, and gives him a stale and exhausted\r\nlook, a very common one, for example, among men who remain too long in\r\ntraining for contest after contest of an athletic sort.\r\n\r\nThe getting up, then, of a large chest, and of large muscles on the\r\nchest, while often contemporary, and each aiding the other, are too\r\nfrequently wholly different matters.\r\n\r\nAnd how is the large chest to be had?\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Broaden and Deepen the Chest itself._\r\n\r\nAnything which causes one to frequently fill his lungs to their utmost\r\ncapacity, and then hold them full as long as he can, tends directly to\r\nopen his ribs, stretch the intercostal muscles, and so expand the\r\nchest. Many kinds of vigorous muscular exercise do this when done\r\ncorrectly, for they cause the full breathing, and at the same time\r\ndirectly aid in opening the ribs. It will be observed that frequently\r\nthroughout these hints about exercising, endeavor has been made to\r\nimpress on the reader that, when exercising, he should hold the head and\r\nneck rigidly erect, and the chest as high as he can. A moment's thought\r\nwill show why. He, for instance, who \"curls\" a heavy dumb-bell, but does\r\nit with his head and shoulders bent over--as many do--while giving his\r\npectorals active work, is actually tending to cramp his chest instead of\r\nexpanding it, the very weight of the dumb-bell all pulling in the wrong\r\ndirection. Now, had he held himself rigidly erect, and, first expanding\r\nhis chest to its utmost by inhaling all the air he possibly could, and\r\nholding it in during the effort--a most valuable practice, by-the-way,\r\nin all feats calling for a great effort--he would not only have\r\nhelped to expand his chest, but would find, to his gratification,\r\nthat he had hit upon a wrinkle which somehow made the task easier\r\nthan it ever was before.\r\n\r\nHolding the head and neck back of the vertical, say six inches, with\r\nthe face pointing to the ceiling, and then working with the dumb-bells\r\nat arm's-length, as above referred to, is grand for the upper chest,\r\ntending to raise the depressed collar-bones and the whole upper\r\nribs, and to make a person hitherto flat-chested now shapely and\r\nfull; while the benefit to lungs perhaps formerly weak would be\r\nhard to over-estimate.\r\n\r\nSteady and protracted running is a great auxiliary in enlarging the\r\nlung-room. So is plenty of sparring. So is the practice of drawing air\r\nslowly in at the nostrils until every air-cell of the lungs is\r\nabsolutely full, then holding it long, and then expelling it slowly.\r\nMost public singers and speakers know the value of this and kindred\r\npractices in bringing, with increased diaphragmatic action, improved\r\npower and endurance of voice.\r\n\r\nSpreading the parallel bars until they are nearly three feet apart, and\r\ndoing such arm-work on them as you can, but with your body below and\r\nface downward, helps greatly in expanding the chest. So does swinging\r\nfrom the rings or bar overhead, or high parallels, and remaining on them\r\nas long as you can.\r\n\r\nDr. Sargent's ingenuity has provided a simple and excellent chest\r\nexpander. He rigs two ordinary pulleys over blocks some feet above the\r\nhead, and from five to six feet apart, as in Fig. 8, and attaching\r\nweights at the floor ends of the ropes, puts ordinary handles on the\r\nother ends, and has the ropes just long enough so that when the\r\nweights are on the floor the handles are about a foot above the head.\r\nNow stand between and directly under them, erect, with the chest as full\r\nas you can make it, and keeping the elbows straight, and grasping the\r\nhandles draw your hands slowly downward out at arm's-length, say about\r\ntwo feet. Next, let the weights drop gradually back, repeat, and so go\r\non. This is excellent for enlarging the whole chest, but especially for\r\nwidening it. A better present to a consumptive person than one of these\r\nappliances could hardly be devised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. A Chest-widener.]\r\n\r\nAgain, to deepen the chest from front to back, he hangs two bars, B and\r\nC, as in Fig. 9, and attaches the weight at the other end, A, of the\r\nrope, the bar B, when at rest, being about a foot above the height of\r\nthe head. Standing, not under B, but about a foot to one side of it, and\r\nfacing it, grasp its ends with both hands, and keeping the arms and legs\r\nstraight and stiff, and breathing the chest brimful, draw downward until\r\nthe bar is about level with the waist. Let the weight run slowly back,\r\nrepeat, and go on.\r\n\r\nA great advantage of both these contrivances, besides their small cost\r\nand simplicity, is that, as in nearly everything Dr. Sargent has\r\ninvented, you can graduate the weight to suit the present requirements\r\nof the person, however weak or strong he or she may be, and so avoid\r\nmuch risk of overdoing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. A Chest-deepener.]\r\n\r\nIn the exercises above named it will be noticed that there has been a\r\nsufficient variety for any given muscles to bring them within the reach\r\nof all. After this, how far any one will go in any desired line of\r\ndevelopment is a matter he can best settle for himself. What allowance\r\nof work to take daily will be treated of in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[M] See Fig. 1, on page 36.\r\n\r\n[N] See page 170.\r\n\r\n[O] See page 92.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nWHAT EXERCISE TO TAKE DAILY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn endeavor has been made thus far to point out how wide-spread is the\r\nlack of general bodily exercise among classes whose vocations do not\r\ncall the muscles into play, and, again, how local and circumscribed is\r\nthat action even among those who are engaged in most kinds of manual\r\nlabor. Various simple exercises have been described which, if followed\r\nsteadily and persistently, will bring size, shape, and strength to any\r\ndesired muscles. It may be well to group in one place a few movements\r\nwhich will enable any one to know at once about what amount and sort of\r\nwork is to be taken daily. Special endeavor will be made to single out\r\nsuch movements as will call for no expensive apparatus. Indeed, most of\r\nthese want no apparatus at all, and hence will be within the reach of\r\nall. As it has been urged that the school is the most suitable place to\r\naccustom children to the kind and amount of work they particularly need,\r\na few exercises will first be suggested which any teacher can learn\r\nalmost at once, but which yet, if faithfully taught to pupils, will\r\nsoon be found to take so little time that, instead of interfering with\r\nother lessons, they will prove a positive aid. Though perhaps\r\nimperceptible at the outset, in a few years, with advancing\r\ndevelopment, the gain made will be found not only to be decided, but\r\nof the most gratifying character.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Daily Work for Children._\r\n\r\nSuppose the teacher has a class of fifty. If the aisles of the\r\nschool-room are, as they should be, at least two feet wide, let the\r\nchildren at about the middle of the morning, and again of the afternoon\r\nsession, stand in these aisles in rows, so that each two of the children\r\nshall be about six feet apart. Let the first order be, that all heads\r\nand necks be held erect. Once these are placed in their right position,\r\nall other parts of their bodies at once fall into place. The simplest\r\nway to insure this is to direct that every head and neck be drawn\r\nhorizontally back, with the chin held about an inch above the level,\r\nuntil they are an inch or two back of the vertical. Now raise the hands\r\ndirectly over the head, and as high as possible, until the thumbs touch,\r\nthe palms of the hands facing to the front, and the elbows being kept\r\nstraight. Now, without bending the elbows, bring the hands downward in\r\nfront toward the feet as far as can comfortably be done, generally at\r\nfirst about as low as the knee, taking care to keep the knees themselves\r\nabsolutely straight; indeed, if possible, bowed even back. Now return\r\nthe hands high over the head, and then repeat, say six times. This\r\nnumber twice a day for the first week will prove enough; and it may be\r\nincreased to twelve the second week, and maintained at that number\r\nthereafter, care being taken to assure two things: one, that the knees\r\nare never bent; the other that, after the first week, the hands are\r\ngradually brought lower down, until they touch the toes. Some persons,\r\nfamiliar with this exercise, can, with the knees perfectly firm and\r\nstraight, lay the whole flat of the hands on the floor in front of their\r\nfeet. But after the first week, reaching the floor with the finger-tips\r\nis enough for the end sought, which is, namely, to make the pupil stand\r\nstraight on his feet, and to remove all tendency toward holding the\r\nknees slightly bent, and so causing that weak, shaky, and sprung look\r\nabout the knees, so very common among persons of all ages, to give way\r\nto a proper and graceful position.\r\n\r\nLet the pupils now stand erect, this time with backs not bent forward,\r\nbut with the body absolutely vertical. Raise the hands above the head as\r\nbefore, elbows straight, till the thumbs touch. Now, never bending body\r\nor knees a hair's-breadth, and keeping the elbows unbent, bring the\r\nhands slowly down, not in front this time, but at the sides just above\r\nthe knees, the little finger and the inner edge of the hand alone\r\ntouching the leg, and the palms facing straight in front. Now notice how\r\ndifficult it is to warp the shoulders forward even an inch. The chest is\r\nout, the head and neck are erect, the shoulders are held low, the back\r\nvertical and hollowed in a little, and the knees straight. Carry the\r\nhands slowly back through the same line till again high over the head.\r\nThen bring them down to the sides again, and do six of these movements\r\ntwice each day the first week, and twelve afterward.\r\n\r\nWhile exercises aimed at any given muscles have been mentioned\r\nelsewhere, any one might follow them all up until every muscle was\r\nshapely and strong, and still carry himself awkwardly, and even in a\r\nslouchy and slovenly manner. This last-named exercise is directly\r\nintended to obviate this. If steadily practised, it is one of the very\r\nbest known exercises, as it not only gives strength, but a fine, erect\r\ncarriage. The whole frame is so held that every vital organ has free\r\nscope and play-room, and their healthier and more vigorous action is\r\ndirectly encouraged. This is one part, indeed the chief exercise, in the\r\nWest Pointer's \"setting-up drill;\" and all who have ever seen the\r\ncadets at the Point will at once recall how admirably they succeed in\r\nacquiring and retaining a handsome carriage and manly mien.\r\n\r\nTo vary the work a little, and to bring special development to\r\nparticular muscles, now let the pupil stand with arms either hanging\r\neasily at the sides, or else held akimbo, the head and neck always\r\nerect, with the heels about four inches apart, and the toes turned\r\noutward. Raise the heels slowly off the floor, the soles and toes\r\nremaining firm on the floor, sustaining the entire weight. When the\r\nheels are as high as possible, hold them there a moment; then lower\r\nslowly till the whole foot is on the floor again; then rise as before,\r\nand so repeat twelve times twice a day the first week, and then\r\ntwenty-five for the following week, continuing this. If this is not\r\nvigorous enough when fifty, after the first month, are tried, it will be\r\nfound that now this work is telling directly on the size, shape, and\r\neffectiveness of the feet and calves, and on the grace and springiness\r\nof the step itself. If any boy or girl wants to become a good jumper, or\r\nto get decided aid in learning to dance long and easily, he or she will\r\nfind this a great help. If they even practice it half an hour a day,\r\nthey will be none the worse for it.\r\n\r\nAll the work thus far recommended here can readily be done in two\r\nminutes. Standing erect, with the arms still akimbo, and the feet as\r\nbefore, now bend the knees so as to stoop six or eight inches, then rise\r\nto the perpendicular, stoop again, and continue this six times, the feet\r\nnever leaving the floor. This strengthens the knees, while the front of\r\nthe thighs get the heaviest part of the work, though the leg below the\r\nknee is doing a good share. (It is not unlike the exercise practised so\r\nassiduously by Rowell on the tread-mill, and which brought him such\r\nmagnificent legs that he became champion pedestrian of the world.) By\r\nthe third week the number may be made twenty-five. If among the scholars\r\nthere are some who are decidedly weak, twenty-five of these exercises\r\nis about the limit. For strong, hearty boys, twice as many will prove\r\nnearer the mark. After two or three months of twenty-five movements\r\nas described for every day, fifty might be tried once by all the\r\npupils, to see whether it is too severe, and if not, then maintained\r\ndaily at the maximum.\r\n\r\nThus far the feet have not left their particular position on the floor.\r\nNow let the pupil stand with the right foot advanced about twelve or\r\nfifteen inches, suddenly rising on the toes, give a slight spring, and\r\nthrow the left foot to the front, and the right back; then spring back\r\nas before, and do this six times twice a day the first week, to twelve\r\nthe second, and twice as many by the end of the month. This calls the\r\nsame muscles into play as the last exercise, and brings the same\r\ndevelopment, but is a little more severe and vigorous.\r\n\r\nIf still harder thigh-work is wanted, starting again, with the feet not\r\nover four inches apart, this time do not raise the heels at all, but\r\nstoop down slowly, as low as possible, bending the knees greatly, of\r\ncourse, the back, however, being held straight all the while. Then rise\r\nto an erect position, then go down again. Practising this three times\r\neach morning and afternoon at first, may be followed up with six a week\r\nlater; and twelve by the end of the month. Better work than this for\r\nquickly giving size and strength to the thighs could hardly be devised;\r\nwhile, as has been already noted, scarcely any muscles on the whole body\r\nare more needed or used for ordinary walking.\r\n\r\nStill standing erect, with arms akimbo, raise the right foot in front\r\nabout as high as the left knee, keeping the right knee unbent. Hold the\r\nright foot there ten seconds; then drop it; then raise it again, fully\r\nsix times. Then, standing, do the same thing with the left foot. This\r\ncalls at once on the muscles across the abdomen, aiding the stomach and\r\nother vital organs there directly in their work.\r\n\r\nThis time raise the foot equally high behind; then return it to the\r\nfloor and so continue, giving each foot equal work to do. The under\r\nthigh, hip, and loin are now in action; and when, later on, they\r\nbecome strong, their owner will find how much easier it is to run\r\nthan it used to be, and also that it has become more natural to stand\r\nerect. The rate of increase of these last two exercises may be about\r\nthe same as the others.\r\n\r\nThere is not much left now of the ten minutes. Still, if the work has\r\nbeen pushed promptly forward, there may still be a little time. However,\r\nall three of the kinds of work suggested for the front thigh need not be\r\npractised at the one recess, any one sufficing at first.\r\n\r\nWith head and neck again erect, and knees firm, hold the hands out at\r\nthe sides and at arm's-length, and clasp the hands firmly together, as\r\nthough trying to squeeze a rubber ball or other elastic substance.\r\nBeginning with twenty of these movements, fifty may be accomplished by\r\nthe end of the fortnight; and by their continuance both the grip and the\r\nshape of the hand will be found steadily improving.\r\n\r\nClasp the hands together over the head. Now turn them over until the\r\npalms are upward, or turned toward the ceiling, and straighten the\r\nelbows until the hands are as high over the head as you can reach. While\r\nholding them in this position, be careful that they are not allowed to\r\ndrop at all. Let the scholar march three or four times around the room\r\nin this position. It will soon be found that no apparatus whatever is\r\nnecessary to get quite a large amount of exercise for the corners of the\r\nshoulders. In this way, while there is an unwonted stretching apart of\r\nthe ribs, and opening up of the chest, the drawing in of the stomach and\r\nabdomen will be found to correct incipient chest weakness,\r\nhalf-breathing, and any tendency toward indigestion.\r\n\r\nFollowing up the method, now let the class form around the side of the\r\nroom, standing three feet apart, and about two feet from the wall. Place\r\nthe hands against the wall, just at a level with and opposite to the\r\nshoulders. Now, keeping the heels all the time on the floor, let the\r\nbody settle gradually forward until the chest touches the wall, keeping\r\nthe elbows pretty near to the sides, the knees never bending a particle,\r\nand the face held upturned, the eyes looking at the ceiling directly\r\noverhead. Now push sharply off from the wall until the elbows are again\r\nstraight, and the body back at vertical. Then repeat this, and continue\r\nsix times for each half of the day for the first week. Keep on until you\r\nreach fifteen by the third week, and twenty-five by the second month.\r\nFor expanding and deepening the chest, helping to poise the head and\r\nneck so that they will remain exactly where they belong--in an erect\r\nposition--and for giving the main part of the upper back-arm quite a\r\ndifficult piece of work to do, this will prove a capital exercise.\r\nWhoever will make a specialty of this one form of exercise until they\r\ndaily take two or even three hundred such pushes, will find that any\r\ntendency he or she may have to flatness or hollowness of chest will soon\r\nbegin to decrease, and will very likely disappear altogether.\r\n\r\nIn this last exercise most of the weight was on the feet, the hands and\r\narms sustaining the rest. If the aisles are not over two feet and a half\r\nwide, let each pupil stand between two opposite desks and place one hand\r\non each. Now, walking back about three or four feet, his hands still\r\nresting on the two desks, let him, keeping his body rigid and knees\r\nunbent, bend his elbows and lower his chest very gradually until it is\r\nnearly or quite level with the desk tops, then slowly straighten up his\r\narms, and so raise his body again to the original position. Three such\r\ndips twice a day the first week, five or six the second, and by the end\r\nof the month ten or twelve, and that number then maintained steadily,\r\nwill open and enlarge the chest materially before the year is out, while\r\nat the same time doing much to increase and strengthen the upper\r\nback-arm. This is harder work than pushing against the wall, because\r\nthe hands and arms now have to sustain a much greater portion of the\r\nweight of the body, but it is correspondingly better for the chest.\r\n\r\nThus far exercises have been described calling for no apparatus at all,\r\nnor anything save a floor to stand on, a wall to push against, two\r\nordinary school desks, and a fair degree of resolution. For children\r\nunder ten, wooden dumb-bells, weighing one pound each, ought to be had\r\nof any wood-turner, and ought not to cost over five cents apiece. There\r\nmight be one pair of dumb-bells given to each child, or, if the class is\r\nlarge, then a single dumb-bell for each, and they could be distributed\r\namong two classes for dumb-bell exercises.\r\n\r\nStanding in the aisles, and about five feet apart, every child taking a\r\ndumb-bell in each hand, keeping the knees unbent and the head and neck\r\nerect, let them raise or \"curl\" the bells slowly until they are up to\r\nthe shoulders, the finger-nails being held upward. Then lower, then\r\nraise again, and so on ten or twelve times each half-day for the first\r\nfortnight, and double that many thereafter. This tells principally on\r\nthe biceps or front of the upper arm, on the front of the shoulder,\r\nand on the pectoral muscles, or those of the upper front chest. When,\r\nlater on, any pupil endeavors to pull himself up to his chin, he\r\nwill find what a large share of the work these muscles have to do.\r\nInstead of the one-pound dumb-bells then, his whole body will be\r\nthe weight to be lifted.\r\n\r\nAgain, let the dumb-bells hang at the sides. Raise them slowly, high up,\r\nbehind the back, keeping the elbows straight and the arms parallel.\r\nAfter holding them there five seconds lower them; do it again, and keep\r\non, ten times twice a day at first, making it twenty in a fortnight, and\r\nthirty thereafter. This work will enlarge that part of the back of the\r\nupper arm next to the body, and will also tell directly on the whole\r\nback of the shoulder, and on the large muscles on the back just below\r\nwhere the arm joins it.\r\n\r\nThis time, holding the knuckles upward and the elbows straight, lift the\r\ndumb-bells till level with the shoulders, the arms being extended\r\nsideways as if on a cross. After holding them up five seconds, lower\r\nthem; then raise them but five or six times at the first lesson,\r\nincreasing to twenty by the end of the month, and then maintaining that\r\nnumber. The corners of the shoulders are getting the work now, and\r\nby-and-by not only shapely shoulders will come from it, but a noticeable\r\nincrease of the breadth across the shoulders. This work may be varied by\r\nraising the arms parallel in front until level with the shoulders, then\r\nlowering, and so continuing.\r\n\r\nNext raise the two bells to the shoulders; then, facing the ceiling,\r\npush both up together until they are as high over the head as possible;\r\nthen lower, push up again, and continue six times twice a day for the\r\nfirst week; make the twelve the third week and the twenty of the fifth,\r\nand then keep at that. The outer or more noticeable parts of the upper\r\nback, the arms, are busiest now; and this exercise directly tends to\r\nenlarge and strengthen them, and to add materially to the appearance\r\nof the arms.\r\n\r\nBut one exercise more need be mentioned here. Stand erect; now draw the\r\nhead and neck back of the vertical all of eight inches, until you face\r\nthe ceiling. Starting with the dumb-bells high up over the head, keeping\r\nthe elbows straight, lower the dumb-bells slowly, until now you are\r\nholding them at arm's-length, with your arms spread, as on a cross. Then\r\nlift them up again, lower, and continue. If this does not spread the\r\nchest open, it will be hard to find anything which will. Do this\r\nconsecutively twenty times every day for a month. That number will take\r\nscarcely a minute to accomplish, but the little one-pound bells will\r\nfeel wondrously heavy before the minute is over.\r\n\r\nHere, then, have been shown quite a variety of exercises, not only safe\r\nand simple but inexpensive, which can readily be adopted in any school.\r\nIf they are followed up as faithfully and steadily as are the other\r\nlessons, they cannot fail to bring decided and very welcome improvement\r\nin the shape and capacity of all the muscles, and hence of the whole\r\nbody, while it will go far toward giving to all the scholars an erect\r\nand healthy carriage. These results alone would delight many a parent's\r\nheart. The making this branch of instruction as compulsory as any other\r\nwould soon accustom the pupil to look for it as matter of course. If it\r\nwere conducted with spirit, it would always be sure to prove\r\ninteresting, and very likely to send the children back to their studies\r\nmuch fresher and brighter for the temporary mental rest.\r\n\r\nBesides these exercises, the teacher, insisting on the value of an erect\r\nposition in school hours, whether the pupil be standing or sitting, and\r\nby inculcating the value of this, would soon find that these efforts\r\nwere being rewarded by making many a crooked girl or boy straight, and\r\nso lessening their chance of having either delicate throats or weak\r\nlungs. Care should be taken that the school chairs have broad and\r\ncomfortable seats, and that the pupil never sits on a half of the seat\r\nor on the edge of it, but far back, and on the whole of it. This\r\napparently small matter will assist marvellously in forming the habit\r\nof an erect position while sitting. Some twenty years ago a Mrs.\r\nCarman, of Boston, devised a chair-back which should just fit the\r\nhollow of the back when the back was held erect, as it should be.\r\nThis simple contrivance greatly encouraged a good position in sitting,\r\nand could well be made a part of the standard chair in our schools.\r\nA pad of the right shape, hung on the back of the chair, would\r\neffect the same object.\r\n\r\nThe teacher's opportunity to work marked and permanent physical benefit\r\nto every pupil under her charge, by daily and steadily following up most\r\nor either of the above exercises, or of some substantially equivalent,\r\ncan scarcely be over-estimated. The exercises strengthen the postures,\r\nwhether sitting or standing. When a teacher insists on having her\r\nchildren erect for six hours out of the twenty-four, and makes plain to\r\neach one the value of being straight, and the self-respect it tends\r\ndirectly to encourage, there need be no great fear that the remaining\r\nwaking hours will make any child crooked. It is in school generally that\r\nthe mischief of warping and crooking is done; and hence there, of all\r\nplaces, would be the most appropriate place for the undoing of it.\r\n\r\nDumb-bells of but a pound each have been mentioned here so far. Such\r\nwould be fitting for pupils under ten years of age. For all older pupils\r\nthe same work with two-pound bells will prove generally vigorous\r\nenough; and whoever wishes to judge what these light weights can do in a\r\nshort time should examine the results of Dr. Sargent's exercises with\r\nthem and other light apparatus at Bowdoin College (see Appendix II.).\r\nThose who are already decidedly strong can of course try larger bells;\r\nbut it is astonishing how soon those of only two pounds seem to grow\r\nheavy, even to those who laugh at them at first.\r\n\r\nOf course, all the work before described cannot be gone through with\r\nin ten minutes in mid-morning, or even in the twenty of the morning\r\nand afternoon sessions combined; but much of it can: and an advantage\r\nof naming too much is that it enables the teacher to vary the work\r\nfrom day to day, and so, while effecting the same results, prevents\r\nanything like monotony.\r\n\r\nAs the months go by, and it is found that the weaker ones have\r\nnoticeably improved, and all are now capable of creditable performances\r\nat these various exercises, they may be carried safely on to the\r\ngymnasium--that is, if the school is fortunate enough to possess one. It\r\nis but a partially equipped school which is not provided with a\r\ngood-sized, well-ventilated room, say of forty or fifty feet square (and\r\none fifty by a hundred would do far better), fitted up with the simpler\r\ngymnastic appliances. Now the teacher, if up to his work, can render\r\neven more valuable assistance than before, by standing by the pupil, as\r\nhe or she attempts the simplest steps on the parallel bars, or the\r\nrings, or the high bars, the pulley-weights, or the horizontal bar;\r\nconstant explanations are to be given how to advance, and setting the\r\nexample, detecting defects and correcting them on the spot, and all the\r\nwhile being ready to catch the pupil and prevent him or her from\r\nfalling. An instructor soon finds that the pupils progress as rapidly as\r\nthey did in the lighter preparatory work, while now they are entering on\r\na field which, if faithfully cultivated, though for only the same brief\r\nintervals daily, will later on insure a class of strong, healthy,\r\nshapely, and symmetrical boys or girls, strong of arm and fleet of foot,\r\nfamiliar with what they can do, and knowing what is not to be attempted.\r\nMuch, indeed the greater part, of the good to be derived from the\r\ngymnasium would have come from steadily adhering to the exercises above\r\npointed out, so that even with no gymnasium excellent progress can be\r\nhad; but results come quicker in the gymnasium, and the place invites\r\ngreater freedom of action. In ten minutes in the morning, for instance,\r\nthirty or forty boys or girls could, following one another promptly,\r\n\"walk\" (on their hands) through the parallel bars with the elbows\r\nunbent, the head of the line crossing at once to the high bars, and\r\n\"walk\" or advance through them, first holding the weight on one hand and\r\nthen on the other, then turning to the horizontal bar and vaulting over\r\nit. If the rear of the line is not yet through the forward \"walk\" on the\r\nparallels, those at the head could take a swing on the rings. Next, they\r\ncould \"walk\" backward through the parallels, then through the high bars;\r\nthen vault again, swing again, and then try the parallels anew--this\r\ntime \"jumping\" forward, or advancing both hands at once, the arms of\r\ncourse being held rigidly straight. Then turning to the high bars,\r\nthey could jump or advance through them, springing forward with both\r\nhands at once, vault again, the bar having meanwhile been raised,\r\nand either try the rings again or rest a moment, and then jump backward\r\nthrough the high bars.\r\n\r\nA little foot-work, for a minute or two remaining, would make a good\r\nconclusion. With the hands closed and elbows bent, the body and arms\r\nheld almost rigid, the neck well back, and the head up, let the column\r\nnow start off around the room on an easy trot, each stepping as\r\nnoiselessly as possible, and no heel touching the floor. A minute of\r\nthis at a lively pace will be abundant at first; and as the legs\r\ngradually get strong, and the breathing improves, the run can be either\r\nmade faster or longer, or both.\r\n\r\nAs the pupils began to grow steadier, with their hands on the bars they\r\ncould next swing their feet back and forth, and jump with their hands as\r\nthey swing forward; then, later, could jump forward as the feet are\r\nswung backward, and backward as the feet are swung forward. The\r\nvaulting-bar for the boys meanwhile may steadily rise, peg after peg;\r\nand, when proficiency is reached with two hands, one-hand vaulting may\r\nbe tried, and the bar gradually raised as before, the teacher always\r\nstanding near the vaulter. The swinging on the rings, instead of being\r\nany longer simple straight-arm work, with the body hanging nearly down,\r\ncan now be done with the elbows bent much of the time, the knees being\r\ncurled up toward the chin as the swinger goes backward.\r\n\r\nAfter two months of straight-arm work on the parallel bars, even the\r\ngirls may now try the same exercises they did with their arms when\r\nstraight, save that now they should always keep them bent at the\r\nelbows. This will come hard even yet, and must be tried with care.\r\nThese are the well-known \"dips,\" followed up little by little, and\r\nmonth after month. By-and-by these exercises will come as easy as was\r\nthe straight-arm work.\r\n\r\nTo all, or nearly all, the high bar work should now be done with bent\r\nelbows, while the vaulting should, say by the end of the year, be nearly\r\nat shoulder height for each pupil, and even, for many of them, that high\r\nwith one hand. The running should have improved correspondingly, so that\r\nfive minutes of it at a respectable pace, say at the rate of a mile in\r\nseven minutes, would not trouble the girls, and even ten minutes of it\r\nnot distress the boys.\r\n\r\nNow, what have these few exercises done for the muscles\r\nand their owners?\r\n\r\nWell, the straight-arm work on the parallels, by throwing the whole\r\nweight on the hands, told directly on the upper back-arm, while the dips\r\nbrought the same region into most vigorous action, and at the same time\r\nopened and strengthened the front of the chest very markedly, tending to\r\nset the shoulders back, and enlarging the chest, and hence the lung-room\r\nas well. The high-bar work told equally upon the biceps muscles, or\r\nthose of the front of the upper arm, and likewise on the front of the\r\nshoulders. The vaulting made the vaulter springy, and strengthened his\r\nthighs and calves materially, and his abdominal muscles somewhat, while\r\nthe more advanced work on the rings brought both the biceps and\r\nabdominal muscles into most energetic play. The running was excellent\r\nfor the entire legs and the abdominals, while as a lung-expander it\r\nis difficult to equal.\r\n\r\nThose proficient at these few exercises, if they have heeded the\r\nendeavors made to secure at all times an erect and easy carriage of the\r\nbody, need but one more thing. With regular and sensible habits of\r\neating, sleeping, dressing, and bathing, they would be almost certain to\r\nbe at once well and strong. The thing wanted is daily constitutional\r\nout-of-doors exercise; whether taken afoot, on horseback, or at the oar,\r\nit matters little, so long as it is vigorously taken and faithfully\r\npersisted in, in all weathers. This guarantees that pure and bracing air\r\nshall be had, breaks up the thread of the day's thoughts, rests the\r\nmind, and quickly refits it for new work. This alone gives the full deep\r\nbreathing, and the healthy tire of the muscles. It furnishes constantly\r\nvarying scene, with needed eye and ear gymnastics--in short, everything\r\nwhich is the reverse of that quiet, sedentary, plodding life over books\r\nor papers, read too often in poorly lighted offices.\r\n\r\nHome exercise, then, with the out-of-door life, will combine to tone us\r\nup, to invigorate our persons, and to keep off either mental or\r\nphysical exhaustion and disorder.\r\n\r\nThe above work, followed up assiduously, ought to bring in its train\r\nhealth, symmetry, a good carriage, buoyant spirits, and a fair share of\r\nnerve and agility. But many a young man is not content with merely\r\nthese; he wants to be very strong. He is already at or near his\r\nmajority. He is quite strong, perhaps, in some ways, but in others is\r\nplainly deficient. What ought he to do?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Daily Exercise for Young Men._\r\n\r\nOn rising, let him stand erect, brace his chest firmly out, and,\r\nbreathing deeply, curl dumb-bells (each of about one-fifteenth of his\r\nown weight) fifty times without stopping. This is biceps work enough for\r\nthe early morning. Then, placing the bells on the floor at his feet, and\r\nbending his knees a little, and his arms none at all, rise to an upright\r\nposition with them fifty times. The loins and back have had their turn\r\nnow. After another minute's rest, standing erect, let him lift the bells\r\nfifty times as far up and out behind him as he can, keeping elbows\r\nstraight, and taking care, when the bells reach the highest point\r\nbehind, to hold them still there a moment. Now the under side of his\r\narms, and about the whole of the upper back, have had their work.\r\nNext, starting with the bells at the shoulders, push them up high\r\nover the head, and lower fifty times continuously. Now the outer part\r\nof the upper arms, the corners of the shoulders, and the waist have\r\nall had active duty.\r\n\r\nFinally, after another minute's rest, start with the bells high over the\r\nhead, and lower slowly until the arms are in about the position they\r\nwould be on a cross, the elbows being always kept unbent. Raise the\r\nbells to height again, then lower, and so continue until you have done\r\nten, care being taken to hold the head six or more inches back of the\r\nperpendicular, and to steadily face the ceiling directly overhead, while\r\nthe chest is swelled out to its uttermost. Rest half a minute after\r\ndoing ten, then do ten more, and so on till you have accomplished fifty.\r\nThis last exercise is one of the best-known chest-expanders. Now that\r\nthese five sorts of work are over, few muscles above the waist have not\r\nhad vigorous and ample work, the lungs themselves have had a splendid\r\nstretch, and you have not spent over fifteen minutes on the whole\r\noperation. If you want to add a little hand and forearm work, catch a\r\nbroom-stick or stout cane at or near the middle, and, holding it at\r\narm's-length, twist it rapidly from side to side a hundred times with\r\none hand, and then with the other.\r\n\r\nIn the late afternoon a five-mile walk on the road, at a four-mile pace,\r\nwith the step inclined to be short, the knees bent but little, and the\r\nfoot pushing harder than usual as it leaves the ground--this will be\r\nfound to bring the legs and loins no inconsiderable exercise; all, in\r\nfact, that they will probably need. If, shortly before bedtime each\r\nevening, the youth, after he has been working as above, say for a month,\r\nwill, in light clothes and any old and easy shoes, run a mile in about\r\nseven minutes and a half, and, a little later, under the seven minutes,\r\nor, three nights a week, make the distance two miles each night, there\r\nwill soon be a life and vigor in his legs which used to be unknown; and\r\nif six months of this work brings a whole inch more on thigh and calf,\r\nit is only what might have been expected.\r\n\r\nFor still more rapid and decided advance, an hour at the gymnasium\r\nduring the latter part of the morning, half of it at the rowing-weights,\r\nso thickening and stoutening the back, and the other half at \"dipping\"\r\nand other half-arm work on the parallel bars--so spreading and enlarging\r\nthe chest and stoutening the back-arms--these will increase the\r\ndevelopment rapidly, and will sharpen the appetite at a corresponding\r\nrate. But it must be real work, and no dawdling or time lost.\r\n\r\nFew young men in any active employment, however, can spare this morning\r\nhour. Still, without it, if they will follow up the before-breakfast\r\nwork, the walking in the fashion named, and the running, they will soon\r\nfind time enough for this much, and most satisfactory results in the\r\nway of improved health and increased strength as well. Indeed, it will\r\nfor most young men prove about the right amount to keep them toned up\r\nand ready for their day's work. If they desire great development in\r\nany special line, let them select some of the exercises described\r\nin the previous chapter, as aimed to effect such development, and\r\npractice them as assiduously, if need be, as Rowell did his\r\ntread-mill work for his legs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Daily Exercise for Women._\r\n\r\nAnd what should the girls and women do each day? With two-pound wooden\r\ndumb-bells at first, let them, before breakfast, go through twenty-five\r\nmovements of each of the five sorts just described for young men. After\r\nsix weeks or two months they can increase the number to fifty, and,\r\nif this does not bring the desired increase in size, and strength\r\nof arm and chest and back, then they can try dumb-bells weighing four\r\nor five pounds each.\r\n\r\nOut-of-doors, either in the latter part of the morning or afternoon, if\r\nthey will, in broad, easy shoes, walk for one hour, not at any listless\r\ntwo-mile pace, but at first as fast as they comfortably can, and then\r\ngradually increasing until in a fortnight or more they can make sure of\r\nthree miles and a half at least, if not of four miles within the hour,\r\nand will observe the way of stepping just suggested to the men, they\r\nwill get about walking enough. And if once in awhile, every Saturday,\r\nfor instance, they make the walk all of five or six miles, getting, if\r\ncity ladies, quite out into the suburbs and back, they will be surprised\r\nand gratified at the greater ease with which they can walk now than\r\nformerly, and at their freshness at the end. Recent reports from India\r\nsay that English ladies there often spend two or three hours daily in\r\nthe saddle. Every American lady who can manage to ride that much, or\r\nhalf of it, and at a strong, brisk pace, will soon have a health and\r\nvigor almost unknown among our women and girls to-day.\r\n\r\nIf walking and horseback parties, instead of being, as now, well-nigh\r\nunheard of among our girls, were every-day affairs, and there was not a\r\npoint of interest within ten miles which every girl, and woman too, did\r\nnot know well, it would prove a benefit both to them and to the next\r\ngeneration which would be almost incalculable.\r\n\r\nGirls should also learn to run. Few of them are either easy or graceful\r\nrunners; but it is an accomplishment quickly learned; and begun at a\r\nshort distance and slow jog, and continued until the girl thinks nothing\r\nof running a mile in seven minutes, and that without once touching a\r\nheel to the ground, it will do more than almost any other known exercise\r\nto make her graceful and easy on her feet, and also to enlarge and\r\nstrengthen her lungs. A roomy school-yard, a bit of lawn, or a\r\ngymnasium-track, either of these is all the place needed in which\r\nto learn this now almost obsolete accomplishment. The gymnasium is\r\nperhaps the best place, as there they can wear costumes which do\r\nnot impede freedom of movement.\r\n\r\nIf besides these things the girl or woman will determine that, as much\r\nas possible of the time each day in which she is sitting down, she will\r\nsit with head and neck up, trunk erect, and with shoulders low, and that\r\nwhenever she stands or walks she will at all times be upright, she will\r\nshortly find that she is getting to be far straighter than she was, and,\r\nif she has a larger and finer chest than formerly, it will be nothing\r\nstrange, for she has simply been using one of the means to get it. If a\r\nstill greater variety of daily work is desired, she can select it from\r\nChapter XII.; the exercises on the pulley-weights and on the apparatus\r\nsketched in Fig. 8 being especially desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Daily Exercise for Business Men._\r\n\r\nAnd what daily work shall the business man take? His aim is not to\r\nlay on muscle, not to become equal to this or that athletic feat,\r\nbut simply to so exercise as to keep his entire physical and mental\r\nmachinery in good working order, and himself equal to all demands\r\nlikely to be made on him.\r\n\r\nFirst he, like the young man or the woman, should make sure of the ten\r\nor fifteen minutes' work before breakfast. Not through the long day\r\nagain will he be likely to have another good opportunity for physical\r\nexercise, at least until evening, and then he will plead that he is too\r\ntired. But in the early morning, fresh and rested, and with a few\r\nminutes at his disposal, he can, as Bryant did, without serious or\r\nviolent effort, work himself great benefit, the good effect of which\r\nwill stay by him all the day. If he has in his room the few bits of\r\napparatus suggested in the chapter on \"Home Gymnasiums,\" he will be\r\nbetter off than Bryant was, in that he can have a far wider range of\r\nexercise, and that all ready at hand.\r\n\r\nLet him first devote two or three minutes to the striking-bag. Facing it\r\nsquarely, with head back and chest well out, let him strike it a\r\nsuccession of vigorous blows, with left and right fists alternating,\r\nuntil he has done a hundred in all. If he has hit hard and with spirit,\r\nhe is puffing freely now, his lungs are fully expanded, his legs have\r\nhad a deal of springing about to do, and his arms and chest have been\r\nbusiest of all. This bag-work is really superb exercise, and if once\r\nor twice, later in the day, say at one's place of business, or at home\r\nagain in the evening, he would take some more of it, he would find\r\nfret, discomfort, and indigestion flying to the winds, and in their\r\nplace buoyancy and exhilaration of spirits to which too many men\r\nhave long been strangers.\r\n\r\nNext grasp the handles in Fig. 8 and bear downward, as described on page\r\n249. Repeat this work for about two minutes, standing all the time\r\nthoroughly erect. Whether the sparring left any part of your chest\r\nunfilled or not, every air-cell is expanded now, while you cannot fail\r\nto be pleased with the thorough way in which this simple contrivance\r\ndoes its work. Care should of course be taken that the air breathed\r\nduring these exercises is pure and fresh.\r\n\r\nNow use the dumb-bells two or three minutes. Let them weigh not over one\r\ntwenty-fifth of your own weight. First, with head and neck a trifle back\r\nof vertical, and the chest held out as full as possible, curl the bells,\r\nor lift them from down at arm's-length until you have drawn them close\r\nup to the shoulders, the finger-nails being turned upward. Lower again\r\nand repeat until you have done twenty-five, the chest being always out.\r\nThe biceps muscles, or those of the front upper arm, and of the front of\r\nthe shoulders and chest, have been busy now.\r\n\r\nNext, starting with the bells at your shoulders, push both at once\r\nsteadily up over your head as high as you can reach, and continue till\r\ntwenty-five are accomplished. The back-arms, corners of the shoulders,\r\nand the waist have now had their turn.\r\n\r\nFacing the pulley-weights (Fig. 4), and standing about two feet from\r\nthem, catch a handle in each hand. Keeping the elbows stiff, draw first\r\none hand and then the other in a horizontal line until your hand is\r\nabout eighteen inches behind you, the body and legs being at all times\r\nheld rigidly erect, and the chest well out. Continue this until you have\r\ndone fifty strokes with each hand. This is excellent for the back of the\r\nshoulders--indeed for nearly the entire back above the waist.\r\n\r\nAgain, with back to the pulley-weights, hold the handles high over the\r\nhead, and leaning forward about a foot, keeping the elbows unbent, bear\r\nthe handles directly downward in front of you, and so do twenty-five.\r\n\r\nBesides these few things, or most of them, put the bar (Fig. 3) in the\r\nupper place, and, catching it with both hands, just swing back and\r\nforth, at first for half a minute, afterward longer, always holding the\r\nhead well back. This is capital at stretching the ribs apart and\r\nexpanding the chest. If the above exercises seem too hard at first,\r\nbegin with half as much, or even less, and work gradually up until the\r\nnumber named can be easily done.\r\n\r\nIf, once in mid-morning and again in mid-afternoon, the man, right in\r\nhis store or office, will turn for two or three minutes to his\r\ndumb-bells, and repeat what he did with his home pair in the morning, he\r\nwill find the rest and change most refreshing. But in any case, whether\r\nhe does so or not, _every man in this country whose life is in-door\r\nought to so divide his time that, come what may, he will make sure of\r\nhis hour out-of-doors in the late afternoon, when the day's work is\r\nnearly or quite done_. If he must get up earlier, or get to his work\r\nearlier, or work faster while he does work, no matter. The prize is well\r\nworth any such sacrifice, and even five times it. Emerson well says,\r\n\"The first wealth is health,\" and no pains should be spared to secure\r\nit. Lose it awhile and see. Exercise vigorously that hour afoot, or\r\nhorseback, or on the water, making sure that during it you utterly\r\nignore your business and usual thoughts. Walk less at first, but soon do\r\nyour four miles in the hour, and then stick to that, of course having\r\nshoes in which it is easy to walk, and before long the good appetite of\r\nboyhood will return, food taste as it often has not done for years,\r\nsound sleep will be surer, and new life and zest will be infused into\r\nall that you do. Let every man in this country who lives by brain-work\r\nget this daily \"constitutional\" at all hazards, and it will do more to\r\nsecure to him future years of health and usefulness than almost anything\r\nelse he can do. It will be observed that there is nothing severe or\r\nviolent in any of these exercises suggested for men--nothing that old\r\nor young may not take with like advantage. The whole idea is to point\r\nout a plain and simple plan of exercise, which, followed up\r\nfaithfully, will make sound health almost certain, and which is\r\neasily within the reach of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Daily Exercise for Consumptives._\r\n\r\nAnd what should these people do? If there is one good lung left, or a\r\ngoodly portion of two, there is much which they can do. Before breakfast\r\nthey need to be more careful than others because of their poorer\r\ncirculation. Still, in a warm and comfortable room they can work to\r\nadvantage even then. In most instances consumptives have not large\r\nenough chests. Stripped to the waist, there is found to be a flatness of\r\nthe upper chest, a lack of depth straight through from breastbone to\r\nspine; and the girth about the chest itself, and especially at the lower\r\npart of it, is often two or more inches less than it is in a well-built\r\nperson of the same height. Now, to weed out these defects, to swell up\r\nand enlarge the chest, and bring it proper breadth, and depth, and\r\nfulness, this will go far toward insuring healthy and vigorous lungs.\r\nAnd how is this done?\r\n\r\nStanding under the handles in an appliance like that represented in Fig.\r\n8, holding the body rigidly erect, the chest out, the knees and elbows\r\nunbent, bear the two handles downward on either side of you until the\r\nhands are as if extended on a cross, using only very light weights at\r\nfirst. Lower the weights again, then bear down again, and so do ten.\r\nJust as you bear down each time, inflate the lungs to their utmost, and\r\nhold the air in them until you have lowered the weights again. Rest\r\nabout a minute, then do ten more, and a little later ten more. This will\r\nbe enough before breakfast work the first week. At breakfast, and\r\nwhenever sitting down throughout the day, determine to do two things--to\r\nsit far back on your chair, and to sit at all times upright. No matter\r\nhow many times you forget or fail, even if a thousand, keep trying\r\nuntil the erect posture becomes habitual. This point once reached,\r\nyou have accomplished a great thing--one which may aid not a little\r\nto save your life.\r\n\r\nNext, about an hour after breakfast, start out for an easy walk. Going\r\nquietly at first, the head held, if anything, back of the vertical, and\r\nthe step short and springy; quicken later into a lively pace, and,\r\nholding that as long as you comfortably can, return to your room. If\r\nyour skin is moist, do not hesitate a minute, but strip at once, and\r\nwith coarse towels rub your skin till it is thoroughly red all over, and\r\nthen put on dry under-clothing. If you then feel like taking a nap, take\r\nit. When well rested, do thirty more strokes at the pulley-weights. In\r\nthe afternoon try more walking, or some horseback work if you can get a\r\nsteed with any dash in him. After you are through, then more weight\r\nwork. Finally, just before retiring, take another turn at the weights.\r\n\r\nAfter the first week run the weight work up to fifty at a time, and\r\nincrease the out-door distance covered both morning and afternoon, being\r\nsure to go in all weathers, and to eat and sleep all you comfortably\r\ncan. Vary the in-door work also somewhat. In addition to the exercise on\r\nFig. 8, practice now an equal number of strokes daily on the appliance\r\ndescribed as Fig. 9, and in the fashion described on page 249. After the\r\nfirst fortnight try hanging by the two hands on the horizontal bar and\r\nswinging lightly back and forth. Before breakfast, before dinner, before\r\nsupper, and just before retiring, take a turn at this swinging. Of it,\r\nand the work on the two sorts of pulley-weights, a weak-lunged person\r\ncan scarcely do enough. These open the ribs apart, broaden and deepen\r\nthe chest, and inflate the lungs--the very things the consumptive\r\nneeds. The out-door work secures him or her ample good air, vigorous\r\nexercise, and frequent change of scene. On the value of this good air,\r\nor rather of the danger of bad air, hear Langenbeck, the great German\r\nanatomist: \"I am sure now of what I suspected long ago, viz., that\r\npulmonary diseases have very little to do with intemperance, * * * and\r\nmuch less with cold weather, but are nearly exclusively (if we except\r\ntuberculous tendencies inherited from _both_ parents, I say _quite_\r\nexclusively) produced by the breathing of foul air.\" This out-door work\r\nshould also be steadily increased until the half-hour's listless walk at\r\nfirst becomes six or eight miles before dinner, and as much more before\r\nsupper. From breakfast to supper one can hardly be exercising\r\nout-of-doors too much; and steadily calling on the heart and lungs in\r\nthese very favorable ways, increased vigor and power are only what might\r\nhave reasonably been looked for.\r\n\r\nAs the months roll on, and this steady work, directed right to the weak\r\nspots, has strengthened and toughened you, now put larger weights on the\r\nFig. 8 appliance, and also increase the number of strokes until you do a\r\nthousand or even two thousand daily--head and body always being held\r\nerect, and full breathing a constant accompaniment. This making a\r\nspecialty of these chest-expanding exercises, none of which are severe\r\nor violent, but which are still vigorous enough, and the abundance of\r\nhealthy and active out-door life, are sure to bring good fruits in this\r\nbattle where the stake is no less than one's own life. They are rational\r\nand vigorous means, aimed directly at the weak part, and, with good air,\r\ngood food, cheerful friends, and ample sleep, will often work marvels,\r\nwhere the filling the stomach with a whole apothecary shop of nauseous\r\noils and other medicines has wholly failed to bring the relief sought.\r\nThese exercises taken by a man already healthy at once tone him up and\r\ninvigorate him, until he begins to have something of the feeling of the\r\nsturdy pioneer, as described by Dr. Mitchell.[P] And if the delicate\r\nperson tries the same means, using them judiciously and carefully, it is\r\nbut natural that he should find similar results.\r\n\r\nSome years ago Dr. G----, of Boston, showed us a photograph of himself\r\ntaken several years previously. The shoulders were warped forward, the\r\nchest looked flat, almost hollow, and the face and general appearance\r\nsuggested a delicate man. He said he inclined to be consumptive. Well,\r\nby practising breathing, not on an ordinary \"blowing-machine,\" where\r\nyou empty your lungs of about all that is in them, but on an\r\ninspirometer, from which instead you inhale every inch of air you can,\r\nand by practising vigorous working of his diaphragm, he had so expanded\r\nhis lungs that he could inhale three hundred and eighty cubic inches of\r\nair at one breath! Certainly the depth of his chest at the later period\r\nwas something astounding, it being, as nearly as we could judge without\r\ncalipers, all of fourteen inches through, directly from breastbone to\r\nspine, while it was a strikingly broad chest as well.\r\n\r\nBut an even more astonishing feature was the tremendous power of his\r\nvoice. He said that at the end of half an hour's public singing with the\r\nopera singers (for he was skilled at that), while they would be hot and\r\nperspiring he was only just warming up and getting ready for his work.\r\nOne thing all who ever heard him sing would quickly concede, namely,\r\nthat seldom had they anywhere heard so immense a voice as his. He said\r\nthat he had also run two blocks in one breath. He looked about the\r\nfarthest remove from a consumptive--a short, stout, fat man, rather.\r\n\r\nNow the in-door chest work above recommended, and the steady and\r\nvigorous daily out-door work, all aiming to deepen and strengthen the\r\nlungs, are well-nigh sure to bring decidedly favorable results; while\r\nthe doctor's habit of frequent, deep, and slow inhaling, cannot fail to\r\nwork great good, and can hardly be practised enough.\r\n\r\nAfter he of weak lungs has once built them up again and regained the\r\nformer vigor, he should not only be sure of his daily in-door exercise\r\nand of his constitutional, but of a longer outing daily than a stronger\r\nman would need. President Day, of Yale, said to have been a consumptive\r\nat seventeen, by good care of his body lived to be ninety-five, and it\r\nis far from uncommon for delicate persons, who take good care of the\r\nsmall stock of vigor they have, to outlive sturdier ones who are\r\nmore prodigal and careless.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[P] See page 77.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Showing the average state of the development of 200 men upon\r\n  entering the Bowdoin College Gymnasium, from the classes of '73,\r\n  '74, '75, '76, and '77._\r\n\r\n  +-------------------+------------------------------+\r\n  |Age                |                 18.3 years.  |\r\n  +-------------------+--------------+---------------+\r\n  |Height             |  5 ft. 8 in. |  67.974 in.   |\r\n  |Weight             |  135 lbs.    |  134.981 lbs. |\r\n  |Chest (inflated.)  |  35 in.      |  35.067 in.   |\r\n  |Chest (contracted) |  32-1/4 in.  |  32.29 in.    |\r\n  |Forearm            |  10 in.      |  10.03 in.    |\r\n  |Upper arm (flexed) |  11 in.      |  10.960 in.   |\r\n  |Shoulders (width)  |  15-1/2 in.  |  15.602 in.   |\r\n  |Hips               |  31-1/2 in.  |  31.475 in.   |\r\n  |Thigh              |  19-1/2 in.  |  19.612 in.   |\r\n  |Calf               |  12-1/2 in.  |  12.729 in.   |\r\n  +-------------------+--------------+---------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Showing the average state of the growth and development of the\r\n  same number of men (200) after having practised in the Bowdoin\r\n  Gymnasium_ half an hour a day _four times a week, for a period of\r\n  six months, under Dr. Sargent._\r\n\r\n  +-------------------+------------------+---------------+\r\n  |Height             |   5 ft. 8-1/4 in.|  68.254 in.   |\r\n  |Weight             | 137 lbs.         | 137.123 lbs.  |\r\n  |Chest (inflated)   |  36-3/4 in.      |  36.829 in.   |\r\n  |Chest (contracted) |  33 in.          |  33.206 in.   |\r\n  |Forearm            |  10-3/4 in.      |  10.760 in.   |\r\n  |Upper arm (flexed) |  12 in.          |  11.903 in.   |\r\n  |Shoulders (width)  |  16-1/4 in.      |  16.260 in.   |\r\n  |Hips               |  33-3/4 in.      |  33.875 in.   |\r\n  |Thigh              |  21 in.          |  20.964 in.   |\r\n  |Calf               |  13-1/4 in.      |  13.232 in.   |\r\n  +------------------+-------------------+---------------+\r\n\r\nIn this case the apparatus used was light dumb-bells, 2-1/2 lbs.; Indian\r\nclubs, 3-1/2 lbs.; pulley-weights, from 10 to 15 lbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX III.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Showing average increase of 200 students at Bowdoin College, in\r\n  various measurements, after working but half an hour a day four\r\n  times a week, for six months, under Dr. Sargent._\r\n\r\n  +---------------------------------------+------------+\r\n  |Average increase in height             |  1/4 in.   |\r\n  |Average increase in weight             |  2 lbs.    |\r\n  |Average increase of chest (contracted) |  3/4 in.   |\r\n  |Average increase of chest (inflated)   |  1-3/4 in. |\r\n  |Average increase of girth of forearm   |  3/4 in.   |\r\n  |Average increase of girth of upper arm |  1 in.     |\r\n  |Average increase of width of shoulders |  3/4 in.   |\r\n  |Average increase of girth of hips      |  2-1/4 in. |\r\n  |Average increase of girth of thigh     |  1-1/2 in. |\r\n  |Average increase of girth of calf      |  3/4 in.   |\r\n  +---------------------------------------+------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Showing the effect of four hours' exercise a week for one year\r\n  upon a youth of 19, at Bowdoin College, under Dr. Sargent's\r\n  direction.

In the last two\r\nchapters have been suggested not a long and difficult system of\r\ngymnastic exercises needing a fully equipped gymnasium, a trained\r\ninstructor, and years of work to master, but rather a few plain and\r\nsimple exercises for any given part or for the whole body, and hints as\r\nto how to distribute the little time to be given to them daily. The\r\nteacher, the parent--the child even, without the aid of either--the\r\nyoung man or woman, the middle-aged and the old, will all find\r\nvariety enough of work, which, while free from risk, will still\r\nprove sufficiently vigorous to insure to each a good allowance\r\nof daily exercise. All else that is needed is a good degree of\r\nthe steadiness and perseverance which are generally inseparable\r\nfrom everything worth accomplishing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER'S NOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\nPassages in italics are indicated by _underscore_.\r\n\r\nIllustrations have been moved from the middle of a paragraph to the\r\nclosest paragraph break.\r\n\r\nThe word up-hill and uphill has been retained in both versions.\r\n\r\nOther than the corrections listed below, printer's inconsistencies in\r\nspelling and punctuation have been retained:\r\n\r\n  changed \"spent mainly indoors?\" into \"spent mainly in-doors?\"\r\n          page 39\r\n\r\n  changed \"his work on \"Sleep,\" as to\" into \"his work on \"Sleep\", as\r\n          to\" page 44\r\n\r\n  changed \"them \"photographed, stripped to the waist, both\" into \"them\r\n          \"photographed, stripped to the waist\", both\" page 144\r\n\r\n  changed \"the 'longshore-man--all at\" into \"the 'longshoreman--all\r\n          at\" page 180\r\n\r\n  changed \"bar A A, the operator simply\" into \"bar A A', the operator\r\n          simply\" page 216\r\n\r\n  changed \"meets the breast-bone, until\" into \"meets the breastbone,\r\n          until\" page 244\r\n\r\n  changed \"out at arms-length, say\" into \"out at arm's-length, say\"\r\n          page 249\r\n\r\n  changed \"it to the floor. and so\" into \"it to the floor and so\"\r\n          page 258\r\n\r\n  changed \"and fore-arm work, catch\" into \"and forearm work, catch\"\r\n          page 274",
