This last work, from its greater length, and from\r\nthe immediate relation of its chief subject to our own country, may be\r\nconsidered the most interesting and important of the series.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hecker is generally acknowledged to be the most learned\r\nmedical historian, and one of the most able medical writers in Germany.\r\nHis numerous works suffice to show not only with what zeal he has\r\nlaboured, but also how highly his labours have been appreciated by his\r\ncountrymen; and when I state that, with one trifling exception, they\r\nhave all been translated into other languages, I furnish a fair proof\r\nof the estimation in which they are held in foreign countries; and,\r\nso far at least as regards the originals, a full justification of the\r\nCouncil of the Sydenham Society in their choice on the present occasion.\r\n\r\nThe “Schwarze Tod,” or “Black Death,” was published in 1832; and I\r\nwas prompted to undertake its translation, from a belief that it\r\nwould prove interesting at a moment when another fearful epidemic, the\r\nCholera, with which it admitted of comparison in several particulars,\r\nwas fresh in the memory of men. The “Tanzwuth,” or “Dancing Mania,”\r\ncame out shortly afterwards; and, as it appeared to me that, though\r\nrelating to a less terrific visitation, it possessed an equal share of\r\ninterest, and, holding a kind of middle place between a physical and a\r\nmoral pestilence, furnished subject of contemplation for the general\r\nas well as the professional reader, I determined on adding it also to\r\nour common stock of medical literature. When the “Englische Schweiss,”\r\nor “Sweating Sickness,” which contained much collateral matter little\r\nknown in England, and which completed the history of the principal\r\nepidemics of the middle ages, appeared in 1834, I proceeded to finish\r\nmy task; but failing in the accomplishment of certain arrangements\r\nconnected with its publication, I laid aside my translation for the\r\ntime under a hope, which has at length been fulfilled, that at some\r\nfuture more auspicious moment, it might yet see the light.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the author, in thus taking up the history\r\nof three of the most important epidemics of the middle ages, although\r\nhe has illustrated them by less detailed notices of several others,\r\nconsiders that he has exhausted his subject; on the contrary, it is his\r\nbelief, that, in order to come at the secret springs of these general\r\nmorbific influences, a most minute as well as a most extended survey\r\nof them, such as can be made only by the united efforts of many, is\r\nrequired. He would seem to aim at collecting together such a number of\r\nfacts from the medical history of all countries and of all ages, as may\r\nat length enable us to deal with epidemics in the same way as Louis has\r\ndealt with individual diseases; and thus by a numerical arrangement of\r\ndata, together with a just consideration of their relative value, to\r\narrive at the discovery of general laws. The present work, therefore,\r\nis but one stone of an edifice, for the construction of which he\r\ninvites medical men in all parts of the world to furnish materials[1].\r\n\r\nWhether the information which could be collected even by the most\r\ndiligent and extensive research would prove sufficiently copious and\r\naccurate to enable us to pursue this method with complete success,\r\nmay be a matter of doubt; but it is at least probable, that many\r\nvaluable facts, now buried in oblivion, would thus be brought to\r\nlight; and the incidental results, as often occurs in the pursuit of\r\nscience, might prove as serviceable as those which were the direct\r\nobject of discovery. Of what immense importance, for instance, in the\r\nfourteenth century, would a general knowledge have been of the simple\r\nbut universal circumstance, that in all severe epidemics, from the\r\ntime of Thucydides[2] to the present day, a false suspicion has been\r\nentertained by the vulgar, that the springs or provisions have been\r\npoisoned, or the air infected by some supposed enemies to the common\r\nweal. How many thousands of innocent lives would thus have been spared,\r\nwhich were barbarously sacrificed under this absurd notion?\r\n\r\nWhether Hecker’s call for aid in his undertaking has, in any instance,\r\nbeen answered by the physicians of Germany, I know not; but he will\r\nbe as much pleased to learn, as I am to inform him, that it was\r\nthe perusal of the “Black Death” which suggested to Dr. Simpson of\r\nEdinburgh the idea of collecting materials for a history of the\r\nLeprosy, as it existed in Great Britain during the middle ages; and\r\nthat this author’s very learned and interesting antiquarian researches\r\non that subject, as published in the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical\r\nJournal, have been the valuable, and, I trust, will not prove the\r\nsolitary result.\r\n\r\nAs the three treatises, now comprised for the first time under the\r\ntitle of “The Epidemics of the Middle Ages,” came out at different\r\nperiods, I have thought it best to prefix to each the original preface\r\nof the author; and to the two which have already been published in\r\nEnglish, that of the translator also; while Hecker’s Address to the\r\nPhysicians of Germany, although written before the publication of the\r\n“Englische Schweiss,” forms an appropriate substitute for an author’s\r\ngeneral preface to the whole volume.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the “Black Death,” I had originally given, as No. III.\r\nof the Appendix, some copious extracts from Caius’ “Boke or Counseill\r\nagainst the Disease commonly called the Sweate or Sweatyng Sicknesse;”\r\nbut this little treatise is so characteristic of the times in which\r\nit was written, so curious, so short, and so very scarce[3], that I\r\nhave thought it worth while, with the permission of the council of our\r\nSociety, to reprint it entire, and to add it in its more appropriate\r\nplace, as an Appendix to the Sweating Sickness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                ADDRESS\r\n                                TO THE\r\n                        PHYSICIANS OF GERMANY.\r\n                          BY J. F. C. HECKER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has long been my earnest desire to address my honoured colleagues,\r\nespecially those with whom I feel myself connected by congeniality\r\nof sentiment, in order to impress on them a subject in which science\r\nis deeply interested, and which, according to the direct evidence\r\nof Nature herself, is one of the most exalted and important that\r\ncan be submitted to the researches of the learned. I allude to the\r\ninvestigation of Epidemic Diseases, on a scale commensurate with the\r\nextent of our exertions in other departments, and worthy of the age\r\nin which we live. It is, with justice, required of medical men, since\r\ntheir sole business is with life, that they should regard it in a\r\nright point of view. They are expected to have a perception of life,\r\nas it exists individually and collectively: in the former, to bear in\r\nmind the general system of creation; in the latter, to demonstrate the\r\nconnexion and signification of the individual phenomena,—to discern\r\nthe one by the aid of the other, and thus to penetrate, with becoming\r\nreverence, into the sanctuary of cosmical and microcosmical science.\r\nThis expectation is not extravagant, and the truth of the principles\r\nwhich the medical explorer of nature deduces from it, is so obvious,\r\nthat it seems scarcely possible that any doubts should be entertained\r\non the subject.\r\n\r\nYet we may ask, Has medical science as it exists in our days, with all\r\nthe splendour which surrounds it, with all the perfection of which it\r\nboasts, satisfied this demand? This question we are obliged to answer\r\nin the negative.\r\n\r\nLet us consider only the doctrine of diseases, which has been\r\ncultivated since the commencement of scientific study. It has grown\r\nup amid the illumination of knowledge and the gloom of ignorance; it\r\nhas been nurtured by the storms of centuries; its monuments of ancient\r\nand modern times cannot be numbered, and it speaks clearly to the\r\ninitiated, in the languages of all civilized nations. Yet, hitherto, it\r\nhas given an account only of individual diseases, so far as the human\r\nmind can discern their nature. In this it has succeeded admirably, and\r\nits success becomes every year greater and more extensive.\r\n\r\nBut if we extend our inquiries to the diseases of nations, and of the\r\nwhole human race, science is mute; as if it were not her province\r\nto take cognizance of them, and shows us only an immeasurable and\r\nunexplored country, which many suppose to be merely a barren desert,\r\nbecause no one to whose voice they are wont to listen, gives any\r\ninformation respecting it. Small is the number of those who have\r\ntraversed it; often have they arrested their steps, filled with\r\nadmiration at striking phenomena; have beheld inexhaustible mines\r\nwaiting only for the hand of the labourer, and, from contemplating the\r\ndevelopment of collective organic life, which science nowhere else\r\ndisplays to them on so magnificent a scale, have experienced all the\r\nsacred joy of the naturalist to whom a higher source of knowledge has\r\nbeen opened. Yet could they not make themselves heard in the noisy\r\ntumult of the markets, and still less answer the innumerable questions\r\ndirected to them by many, as from one mouth, not indeed to inquire\r\nafter the truth, but to obtain a confirmation of an anciently received\r\nopinion, which originated in the fifth century before our era.\r\n\r\nHence it is, that the doctrine of epidemics, surrounded by the other\r\nflourishing branches of medicine, remains alone unfruitful—we might\r\nalmost say stunted in its growth. For, to the weighty opinions\r\nof Hippocrates, to the doctrines of Fracastoro which contain\r\nthe experience of the much-tried Middle Ages, and lastly to the\r\nobservations of Sydenham, only trifling and isolated facts have been\r\nadded. Beyond these facts there exist, even up to the present times,\r\nonly assumptions, which might, long since, have been reduced to their\r\noriginal nothingness, had that serious spirit of inquiry prevailed\r\nwhich comprehends space and penetrates ages.\r\n\r\nNo epidemic ever prevailed during which the need of more accurate\r\ninformation was not felt, and during which the wish of the learned was\r\nnot loudly expressed, to become acquainted with the secret springs\r\nof such stupendous engines of destruction. Was the disease of a new\r\ncharacter?—the spirit of inquiry was roused among physicians; nor were\r\nthe most eminent of them ever deficient either in courage or in zeal\r\nfor investigation. When the glandular plague first made its appearance\r\nas an universal epidemic, whilst the more pusillanimous, haunted by\r\nvisionary fears, shut themselves up in their closets, some physicians\r\nat Constantinople, astonished at the phenomenon, opened the boils of\r\nthe deceased. The like has occurred both in ancient and modern times,\r\nnot without favourable results for science; nay, more matured views\r\nexcited an eager desire to become acquainted with similar or still\r\ngreater visitations among the ancients; but as later ages have always\r\nbeen fond of referring to Grecian antiquity, the learned of those\r\ntimes, from a partial and meagre predilection, were contented with the\r\ndescriptions of Thucydides, even where nature had revealed, in infinite\r\ndiversity, the workings of her powers.\r\n\r\nThese researches, if indeed they deserved that name, were never\r\nscientific or comprehensive. They never seized but upon a part, and\r\nno sooner had the mortality ceased, than the scarcely awakened zeal\r\nrelapsed into its former indifference to the interesting phenomena\r\nof nature, in the same way as abstemiousness, which had ever been\r\npractised during epidemics, only as a constrained virtue, gave\r\nplace, as soon as the danger was over, to unbridled indulgence. This\r\ninconstancy might almost bring to our mind the pious Byzantines who, on\r\nthe shock of an earthquake, in 529, which appeared as the prognostic\r\nof the great epidemic, prostrated themselves before their altars by\r\nthousands, and sought to excel each other in Christian self-denial\r\nand benevolence; but no sooner did they feel the ground firm beneath\r\ntheir feet, than they again abandoned themselves, without remorse, to\r\nall the vices of the metropolis. May I be pardoned for this comparison\r\nof scientific zeal with other human excitements? Alas! even this is\r\na virtue which few practise for its own sake, and which, with the\r\nmultitude, stands quite as much in need as any other, of the incentives\r\nof fear and reward.\r\n\r\nBut we are constrained to acknowledge that among our medical\r\npredecessors, these incentives were scarcely ever sufficiently\r\npowerful to induce them to leave us circumstantial and scientific\r\naccounts of contemporary epidemics, which, nevertheless, have, even\r\nin historical times, afflicted, in almost numberless visitations,\r\nthe whole human race. Still less did it occur to them to take a\r\nmore exalted stand, whence they could comprehend at one view, these\r\nstupendous phenomena of organic collective life, wherein the whole\r\nspirit of humanity powerfully and wonderfully moves, and thus regard\r\nthem as one whole, in which higher laws of nature, uniting together the\r\nutmost diversity of individual parts, might be anticipated or perceived.\r\n\r\nHere a wide, and almost unfathomable chasm occurs in the science of\r\nmedicine, which, in this age of mature judgment and multifarious\r\nlearning, cannot, as formerly, be overlooked. History alone can fill\r\nit up; she alone can give to the doctrine of diseases that importance\r\nwithout which its application is limited to occurrences of the moment;\r\nwhereas the development of the phenomena of life, during extensive\r\nperiods, is no less a problem of research for the philosopher, who\r\nmakes the boundless science of nature his study, than the revolutions\r\nof the planet on which we move. In this region of inquiry the very\r\nstones have a language, and the inscriptions are yet legible which,\r\nbefore the creation of man, were engraved by organic life, in wondrous\r\nforms on eternal tablets. Exalted ideas of the monuments of primæval\r\nantiquity are here excited, and the forms of the antemundane ways and\r\ncreations of nature are conjured up from the inmost bosom of the earth,\r\nin order to throw their bright beaming light upon the surface of the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nMedicine extends not so far. The remains of animals make us indeed\r\nacquainted, even now, with diseases to which the brute creation was\r\nsubject long ere the waters overflowed, and the mountains sunk; but\r\nthe investigation which is our more immediate object, scarcely reaches\r\nto the beginning of human culture. Records of remote and of proximate\r\neras, lie before us in rich abundance. They speak of the deviations\r\nand destructions of human life, of exterminated and newly-formed\r\nnations; they lay before us stupendous facts, which we are called\r\nupon to recognise and expound in order to solve this exalted problem.\r\nIf physicians cannot boast of having unrolled these records with the\r\navidity of true explorers of Nature, they may find some excuse in the\r\nnature of the inquiry—for the characters are dead, and the spirits of\r\nwhich they are the magic symbols, manifest themselves only to him\r\nwho knows how to adjure them. Epidemics leave no corporeal traces;\r\nwhence their history is perhaps more intellectual than the science\r\nof the Geologist, who, on his side, possesses the advantage of\r\ntreating on subjects which strike the senses, and are therefore more\r\nattractive,—such as the impressions of plants no longer extant, and the\r\nskeletons of lost races of animals. This, however, does not entirely\r\nexculpate us from the charge of neglecting our science, in a quarter\r\nwhere the most important facts are to be unveiled. It is high time to\r\nmake up for what has been left unaccomplished, if we would not remain\r\nidle and mean-spirited in the rear of other naturalists.\r\n\r\nI was animated by these and similar reflections, and excited too by\r\npassing events, when I undertook to write the history of the “Black\r\nDeath.” With some anxiety, I sent this book into the world, for it\r\nwas scarcely to be expected that it would be everywhere received with\r\nindulgence, since it belonged to an hitherto unknown department of\r\nhistorical research, the utility of which might not be obvious in our\r\npractical times. Yet I soon received encouragement, not only from\r\nlearned friends, but also from other men of distinguished merit, on\r\nwhose judgment I placed great reliance; and thus I was led to hope that\r\nit was not in vain, and without some advantage to science, that I had\r\nunveiled the dismal picture of a long departed age.\r\n\r\nThis work I have followed up by a treatise on a nervous disorder,\r\nwhich, for the first time, appeared in the same century, as an\r\nepidemic, with symptoms that can be accounted for only by the spirit of\r\nthe Middle Ages—symptoms which, in the manner of the diffusion of the\r\ndisease among thousands of people, and of its propagation for more than\r\ntwo centuries, exercised a demoniacal influence over the human race,\r\nyet in close, though uncongenial alliance, with kindlier feelings.\r\nI have prepared materials for various other subjects, so far as the\r\nresources at my disposal extend, and I may hope, if circumstances prove\r\nfavourable, to complete by degrees, the history of a more extensive\r\nseries of Epidemics on the same plan as the “Black Death,” and the\r\n“Dancing Mania.”\r\n\r\nAmid the accumulated materials which past ages afford, the powers and\r\nthe life of one individual, even with the aid of previous study, are\r\ninsufficient to complete a comprehensive history of Epidemics. The\r\nzealous activity of many must be exerted if we would speedily possess\r\na work which is so much wanted in order that we may not encounter\r\nnew epidemics with culpable ignorance of analogous phenomena. How\r\noften has it appeared on the breaking out of epidemics, as if the\r\nexperience of so many centuries had been accumulated in vain. Men gazed\r\nat the phenomena with astonishment, and even before they had a just\r\nperception of their nature, pronounced their opinions, which, as they\r\nwere divided into strongly opposed parties, they defended with all the\r\nardour of zealots, wholly unconscious of the majesty of all-governing\r\nnature. In the descriptive branches of natural history, a person would\r\ninfallibly expose himself to the severest censure, who should attempt\r\nto describe some hitherto unknown natural production, whether animal or\r\nvegetable, if he were ignorant of the allied genera and species, and\r\nperhaps neither a botanist nor zoologist; yet an analogous ignorance of\r\nepidemics, in those who nevertheless discussed their nature, but too\r\nfrequently occurred, and men were insensible to the justest reproof.\r\nThus it has ever been, and for this reason we cannot apply to ourselves\r\nin this department, the significant words of Bacon, that we are the\r\nancients, and our forefathers the moderns, for we are equally remote,\r\nwith them, from a scientific and comprehensive knowledge of epidemics.\r\nThis might, and ought to be otherwise, in an age which, in other\r\nrespects, may, with justice, boast of a rich diversity of knowledge,\r\nand of a rapid progress in the natural sciences.\r\n\r\nIf in the form of an address to the physicians of Germany, I express\r\nthe wish to see such a melancholy state of things remedied, the\r\nnature of the subject requires that, with the exception of the still\r\nprevailing Cholera, remarkable universal epidemics should be selected\r\nfor investigation. They form the grand epochs, according to which\r\nthose epidemics which are less extensive, but not, on that account,\r\nless worthy of observation, naturally range themselves. Far be it from\r\nme to recommend any fixed series, or even the plan and method to be\r\npursued in treating the subject. It would, perhaps, be, on the whole,\r\nmost advantageous, if my honoured Colleagues, who attend to this\r\nrequest, were to commence with those epidemics for which they possess\r\ncomplete materials, and that entirely according to their own plan,\r\nwithout adopting any model for imitation, for in this manner simple\r\nhistorical truth will be best elicited. Should it, however, be found\r\nimpracticable to furnish historical descriptions of entire epidemics,\r\na task often attended with difficulties, interesting fragments of all\r\nkinds, for which there are rich treasures in MSS. and scarce works in\r\nvarious places, would be no less welcome and useful towards the great\r\nobject of preparing a collective history of epidemics.\r\n\r\nUp to the present moment, it might almost seem that the most\r\nessential preliminaries are wanting for the accomplishment of such\r\nan undertaking. The study of medical history is everywhere at a low\r\nebb;—in France and England scarcely a trace remains, to the most\r\nserious detriment of the whole domain of medicine; in Germany too,\r\nthere are but few who suspect what inexhaustible stores of instructive\r\ntruth are lying dormant within their power; they may, perhaps,\r\nclass them among theoretical doctrines, and commend the laborious\r\ninvestigation of them without being willing to recognise their spirit.\r\nNone of the Universities of Germany, whose business it ought to be\r\nto provide, in this respect, for the prosperity of the inheritance\r\ncommitted to their charge, can boast a Professor’s chair for the\r\nHistory of Medicine; nay, in many, it is so entirely unknown, that it\r\nis not even regarded as an object of secondary importance, so that it\r\nis to be apprehended that the fame of German erudition, may, at least\r\nin medicine, gradually vanish, and our medical knowledge become, as\r\npractical indeed, but at the same time as assuming, as mechanical,\r\nand as defective, as that of France and England. Even those noble\r\ninstitutions, the Academies, in which the spirit of the eighteenth\r\ncentury still lingers, and whose more peculiar province it is to\r\nexplore the rich pages of science, have not entered upon the history\r\nof Epidemics, and by their silence have encouraged the unfounded and\r\ninjurious supposition, that this field is desolate and unfruitful.\r\n\r\nAll these obstacles are indeed great, but to determined and persevering\r\nexertion they are not insuperable; and, though we cannot conceal them\r\nfrom ourselves, we should not allow them to daunt our spirit. There is,\r\nin Germany, a sufficiency of intellectual power to overcome them; let\r\nthis power be combined, and exert itself in active co-operation.

Some\r\nof these have never before been made generally known, while others\r\nhave passed out of mind, being effaced from our memories by subsequent\r\nevents of a similar kind, which, though really of less magnitude and\r\nimportance, have, in the perspective of time, appeared greater, because\r\nthey have occurred nearer to our own days.\r\n\r\nDreadful as was the pestilence here described, and in few countries\r\nmore so than in England, our modern historians only slightly allude to\r\nits visitation:—Hume deems a single paragraph sufficient to devote to\r\nits notice, and Henry and Rapin are equally brief.\r\n\r\nIt may not then be unacceptable to the medical, or even to the general\r\nreader, to receive an authentic and somewhat detailed account of one of\r\nthe greatest natural calamities that ever afflicted the human race.\r\n\r\nMy chief motive, however, for translating this small work, and at\r\nthis particular period, has been a desire that, in the study of the\r\ncauses which have produced and propagated general pestilences, and of\r\nthe moral effects by which they have been followed, the most enlarged\r\nviews should be taken. The contagionist and the anti-contagionist may\r\neach find ample support for his belief in particular cases; but in\r\nthe construction of a theory sufficiently comprehensive to explain\r\nthroughout, the origin and dissemination of universal disease, we\r\nshall not only perceive the insufficiency of either doctrine, taken\r\nsingly, but after admitting the combined influence of both, shall even\r\nthen find our views too narrow, and be compelled, in our endeavours\r\nto explain the facts, to acknowledge the existence of unknown powers,\r\nwholly unconnected either with communication by contact or atmospheric\r\ncontamination.\r\n\r\nI by no means wish it to be understood, that I have adopted the\r\nauthor’s views respecting astral and telluric influences, the former of\r\nwhich, at least, I had supposed to have been, with alchemy and magic,\r\nlong since consigned to oblivion; much less am I prepared to accede\r\nto his notion, or rather an ancient notion derived from the East and\r\nrevived by him, of an organic life in the system of the universe. We\r\nare constantly furnished with proofs, that that which affects life is\r\nnot itself alive; and whether we look to the earth for exhalations,\r\nto the air for electrical phenomena, to the heavenly bodies for an\r\ninfluence over our planet, or to all these causes combined, for the\r\nformation of some unknown principle noxious to animal existence, still,\r\nif we found our reasoning on ascertained facts, we can perceive nothing\r\nthroughout this vast field for physical research which is not evidently\r\ngoverned by the laws of inert matter—nothing which resembles the\r\nregular succession of birth, growth, decay, death, and regeneration,\r\nobservable in organized beings. To assume, therefore, causes of whose\r\nexistence we have no proof, in order to account for effects which,\r\nafter all, they do not explain, is making no real advance in knowledge,\r\nand can scarcely be considered otherwise than an indirect method of\r\nconfessing our ignorance.\r\n\r\nStill, however, I regard the author’s opinions, illustrated as they are\r\nby a series of interesting facts diligently collected from authentic\r\nsources, as, at least, worthy of examination before we reject them, and\r\nvaluable, as furnishing extensive data on which to build new theories.\r\n\r\nI have another, perhaps I may be allowed to say a better, motive for\r\nlaying before my countrymen this narrative of the sufferings of past\r\nages,—that by comparing them with those of our own time, we may be made\r\nthe more sensible how lightly the chastening hand of Providence has\r\nfallen on the present generation, and how much reason, therefore, we\r\nhave to feel grateful for the mercy shown us.\r\n\r\nThe publication has, with this view, been purposely somewhat delayed,\r\nin order that it might appear at a moment when it is to be presumed\r\nthat men’s thoughts will be especially directed to the approaching\r\nhour of public thanksgiving, and when a knowledge of that which they\r\nhave escaped, as well as of that which they have suffered, may tend to\r\nheighten their devotional feelings on that solemn occasion.\r\n\r\nWhen we learn that, in the fourteenth century, one quarter, at least,\r\nof the population of the old world was swept away in the short space of\r\nfour years, and that some countries, England among the rest, lost more\r\nthan double that proportion of their inhabitants in the course of a few\r\nmonths, we may well congratulate ourselves that our visitation has not\r\nbeen like theirs, and shall not justly merit ridicule, if we offer our\r\nhumble thanks to the “Creator and Preserver of all mankind” for our\r\ndeliverance.\r\n\r\nNor would it disgrace our feelings, if, in expiation of the abuse\r\nand obloquy not long since so lavishly bestowed by the public on the\r\nmedical profession, we should entertain some slight sense of gratitude\r\ntowards those members of the community, who were engaged, at the risk\r\nof their lives and the sacrifice of their personal interests, in\r\nendeavouring to arrest the progress of the evil, and to mitigate the\r\nsufferings of their fellow men.\r\n\r\nI have added, at the close of the Appendix, some extracts from a scarce\r\nlittle work in black letter, called “A Boke or Counseill against the\r\nDisease commonly called the Sweate or Sweatyng Sicknesse,” published\r\nby Caius in 1552. This was written three years before his Latin\r\ntreatise on the same subject, and is so quaint, and, at the same time,\r\nso illustrative of the opinions of his day, and even of those of the\r\nfourteenth century, on the causes of universal diseases, that the\r\npassages which I have quoted will not fail to afford some amusement as\r\nwell as instruction. If I have been tempted to reprint more of this\r\ncurious production than was necessary to my primary object, it has been\r\nfrom a belief that it would be generally acceptable to the reader to\r\ngather some particulars regarding the mode of living in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and to observe the author’s animadversions on the degeneracy\r\nand credulity of the age in which he lived. His advice on the choice of\r\na medical attendant cannot be too strongly recommended, at least _by a\r\nphysician_; and his warning against quackery, particularly the quackery\r\nof _painters_, who “scorne (_quære_ score?) you behind your backs with\r\ntheir medicines, so filthy that I am ashamed to name them,” seems quite\r\nprophetic.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I beg to acknowledge the obligation which I owe to my\r\nfriend Mr. H. E. Lloyd, whose intimate acquaintance with the German\r\nlanguage and literature will, I hope, be received as a sufficient\r\npledge that no very important errors remain in a translation which he\r\nhas kindly revised.\r\n\r\n  London, 1833.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe here find an important page of the history of the world laid open\r\nto our view. It treats of a convulsion of the human race, unequalled\r\nin violence and extent. It speaks of incredible disasters, of despair\r\nand unbridled demoniacal passions. It shews us the abyss of general\r\nlicentiousness, in consequence of an universal pestilence, which\r\nextended from China to Iceland and Greenland.\r\n\r\nThe inducement to unveil this image of an age, long since gone by, is\r\nevident. A new pestilence has attained almost an equal extent, and\r\nthough less formidable, has partly produced, partly indicated, similar\r\nphenomena. Its causes and its diffusion over Asia and Europe, call on\r\nus to take a comprehensive view of it, because it leads to an insight\r\ninto the organism of the world, in which the sum of organic life is\r\nsubject to the great powers of Nature. Now, human knowledge is not yet\r\nsufficiently advanced, to discover the connexion between the processes\r\nwhich occur above, and those which occur below, the surface of the\r\nearth, or even fully to explore those laws of nature, an acquaintance\r\nwith which would be required; far less to apply them to great\r\nphenomena, in which one spring sets a thousand others in motion.\r\n\r\nOn this side, therefore, such a point of view is not to be found, if\r\nwe would not lose ourselves in the wilderness of conjectures, of which\r\nthe world is already too full: but it may be found in the ample and\r\nproductive field of historical research.\r\n\r\nHistory—that mirror of human life in all its bearings, offers, even for\r\ngeneral pestilences, an inexhaustible, though scarcely explored, mine\r\nof facts; here too it asserts its dignity, as the philosophy of reality\r\ndelighting in truth.\r\n\r\nIt is conformable to its spirit to conceive general pestilences as\r\nevents affecting the whole world—to explain their phenomena by the\r\ncomparison of what is similar. Thus the facts speak for themselves,\r\nbecause they appear to have proceeded from those higher laws which\r\ngovern the progression of the existence of mankind. A cosmical\r\norigin and convulsive excitement, productive of the most important\r\nconsequences among the nations subject to them, are the most striking\r\nfeatures to which history points in all general pestilences. These,\r\nhowever, assume very different forms, as well in their attacks on\r\nthe general organism, as in their diffusion; and in this respect a\r\ndevelopment from form to form, in the course of centuries, is manifest,\r\nso that the history of the world is divided into grand periods in which\r\npositively defined pestilences prevailed. As far as our chronicles\r\nextend, more or less certain information can be obtained respecting\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut this part of medical history, which has such a manifold and\r\npowerful influence over the history of the world, is yet in its\r\ninfancy. For the honour of that science which should everywhere guide\r\nthe actions of mankind, we are induced to express a wish, that it may\r\nfind room to flourish amidst the rank vegetation with which the field\r\nof German medical science is unhappily encumbered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE BLACK DEATH.\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                         GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat Omnipotence which has called the world with all its living\r\ncreatures into one animated being, especially reveals himself in\r\nthe desolation of great pestilences. The powers of creation come\r\ninto violent collision; the sultry dryness of the atmosphere; the\r\nsubterraneous thunders; the mist of overflowing waters, are the\r\nharbingers of destruction. Nature is not satisfied with the ordinary\r\nalternations of life and death, and the destroying angel waves over man\r\nand beast his flaming sword.\r\n\r\nThese revolutions are performed in vast cycles, which the spirit of\r\nman, limited, as it is, to a narrow circle of perception, is unable\r\nto explore. They are, however, greater terrestrial events than any of\r\nthose which proceed from the discord, the distress, or the passions of\r\nnations. By annihilations they awaken new life; and when the tumult\r\nabove and below the earth is past, nature is renovated, and the\r\nmind awakens from torpor and depression to the consciousness of an\r\nintellectual existence.\r\n\r\nWere it in any degree within the power of human research to draw up,\r\nin a vivid and connected form, an historical sketch of such mighty\r\nevents, after the manner of the historians of wars and battles, and the\r\nmigrations of nations, we might then arrive at clear views with respect\r\nto the mental development of the human race, and the ways of Providence\r\nwould be more plainly discernible. It would then be demonstrable, that\r\nthe mind of nations is deeply affected by the destructive conflict of\r\nthe powers of nature, and that great disasters lead to striking changes\r\nin general civilization. For all that exists in man, whether good or\r\nevil, is rendered conspicuous by the presence of great danger. His\r\ninmost feelings are roused—the thought of self-preservation masters\r\nhis spirit—self-denial is put to severe proof, and wherever darkness\r\nand barbarism prevail, there the affrighted mortal flies to the idols\r\nof his superstition, and all laws, human and divine, are criminally\r\nviolated.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with a general law of nature, such a state of excitement\r\nbrings about a change, beneficial or detrimental, according to\r\ncircumstances, so that nations either attain a higher degree of moral\r\nworth, or sink deeper in ignorance and vice. All this, however, takes\r\nplace upon a much grander scale than through the ordinary vicissitudes\r\nof war and peace, or the rise and fall of empires, because the powers\r\nof nature themselves produce plagues, and subjugate the human will,\r\nwhich, in the contentions of nations, alone predominates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                             THE DISEASE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most memorable example of what has been advanced, is afforded\r\nby a great pestilence of the fourteenth century, which desolated\r\nAsia, Europe, and Africa, and of which the people yet preserve the\r\nremembrance in gloomy traditions. It was an oriental plague, marked by\r\ninflammatory boils and tumours of the glands, such as break out in no\r\nother febrile disease. On account of these inflammatory boils, and from\r\nthe black spots, indicatory of a putrid decomposition, which appeared\r\nupon the skin, it was called in Germany and in the northern kingdoms\r\nof Europe, _the Black Death_, and in Italy, la Mortalega Grande, _the\r\nGreat Mortality_[4].\r\n\r\nFew testimonies are presented to us respecting its symptoms and its\r\ncourse, yet these are sufficient to throw light upon the form of the\r\nmalady, and they are worthy of credence, from their coincidence with\r\nthe signs of the same disease in modern times.\r\n\r\nThe imperial writer, Kantakusenos[5], whose own son, Andronikus, died\r\nof this plague in Constantinople, notices great imposthumes[6] of\r\nthe thighs and arms of those affected, which, when opened, afforded\r\nrelief by the discharge of an offensive matter. Buboes, which are the\r\ninfallible signs of the oriental plague, are thus plainly indicated,\r\nfor he makes separate mention of smaller boils on the arms and in the\r\nface, as also in other parts of the body, and clearly distinguishes\r\nthese from the blisters[7], which are no less produced by plague in all\r\nits forms. In many cases, black spots[8] broke out all over the body,\r\neither single, or united and confluent.\r\n\r\nThese symptoms were not all found in every case. In many, one alone was\r\nsufficient to cause death, while some patients recovered, contrary to\r\nexpectation, though afflicted with all. Symptoms of cephalic affection\r\nwere frequent; many patients became stupified and fell into a deep\r\nsleep, losing also their speech from palsy of the tongue; others\r\nremained sleepless and without rest. The fauces and tongue were black,\r\nand as if suffused with blood; no beverage would assuage their burning\r\nthirst, so that their sufferings continued without alleviation until\r\nterminated by death, which many in their despair accelerated with their\r\nown hands. Contagion was evident, for attendants caught the disease of\r\ntheir relations and friends, and many houses in the capital were bereft\r\neven of their last inhabitant. Thus far the ordinary circumstances only\r\nof the oriental plague occurred. Still deeper sufferings, however,\r\nwere connected with this pestilence, such as have not been felt at\r\nother times; the organs of respiration were seized with a putrid\r\ninflammation; a violent pain in the chest attacked the patient; blood\r\nwas expectorated, and the breath diffused a pestiferous odour.\r\n\r\nIn the West, the following were the predominating symptoms on the\r\neruption of this disease[9]. An ardent fever, accompanied by an\r\nevacuation of blood, proved fatal in the first three days. It appears\r\nthat buboes and inflammatory boils did not at first come out at all,\r\nbut that the disease, in the form of carbuncular (_anthraxartigen_)\r\naffection of the lungs, effected the destruction of life before the\r\nother symptoms were developed.\r\n\r\nThus did the plague rage in Avignon for six or eight weeks, and the\r\npestilential breath of the sick, who expectorated blood, caused a\r\nterrible contagion far and near; for even the vicinity of those who\r\nhad fallen ill of plague was certain death[10]; so that parents\r\nabandoned their infected children, and all the ties of kindred were\r\ndissolved. After this period, buboes in the axilla and in the groin,\r\nand inflammatory boils all over the body, made their appearance; but it\r\nwas not until seven months afterwards that some patients recovered with\r\nmatured buboes, as in the ordinary milder form of plague.\r\n\r\nSuch is the report of the courageous Guy de Chauliac, who vindicated\r\nthe honour of medicine, by bidding defiance to danger; boldly and\r\nconstantly assisting the affected, and disdaining the excuse of\r\nhis colleagues, who held the Arabian notion, that medical aid was\r\nunavailing, and that the contagion justified flight. He saw the plague\r\ntwice in Avignon, first in the year 1348, from January to August, and\r\nthen twelve years later, in the autumn, when it returned from Germany,\r\nand for nine months spread general distress and terror. The first time\r\nit raged chiefly among the poor, but in the year 1360, more among the\r\nhigher classes. It now also destroyed a great many children, whom it\r\nhad formerly spared, and but few women.\r\n\r\nThe like was seen in Egypt[11]. Here also inflammation of the lungs was\r\npredominant, and destroyed quickly and infallibly, with burning heat\r\nand expectoration of blood. Here too the breath of the sick spread a\r\ndeadly contagion, and human aid was as vain as it was destructive to\r\nthose who approached the infected.\r\n\r\nBoccacio, who was an eye-witness of its incredible fatality in\r\nFlorence, the seat of the revival of science, gives a more lively\r\ndescription of the attack of the disease than his non-medical\r\ncontemporaries[12].\r\n\r\nIt commenced here, not as in the East, with bleeding at the nose, a\r\nsure sign of inevitable death; but there took place at the beginning,\r\nboth in men and women, tumours in the groin and in the axilla, varying\r\nin circumference up to the size of an apple or an egg, and called\r\nby the people, pest-boils (gavoccioli). Then there appeared similar\r\ntumours indiscriminately over all parts of the body, and black or blue\r\nspots came out on the arms or thighs, or on other parts, either single\r\nand large, or small and thickly studded. These spots proved equally\r\nfatal with the pest-boils, which had been from the first regarded as\r\na sure sign of death[13]. No power of medicine brought relief—almost\r\nall died within the first three days, some sooner, some later, after\r\nthe appearance of these signs, and for the most part entirely without\r\nfever[14] or other symptoms. The plague spread itself with the greater\r\nfury, as it communicated from the sick to the healthy, like fire among\r\ndry and oily fuel, and even contact with the clothes and other articles\r\nwhich had been used by the infected, seemed to induce the disease. As\r\nit advanced, not only men, but animals fell sick and shortly expired,\r\nif they had touched things belonging to the diseased or dead. Thus\r\nBoccacio himself saw two hogs on the rags of a person who had died of\r\nplague, after staggering about for a short time, fall down dead, as\r\nif they had taken poison. In other places multitudes of dogs, cats,\r\nfowls and other animals, fell victims to the contagion[15]; and it is\r\nto be presumed that other epizootes among animals likewise took place,\r\nalthough the ignorant writers of the fourteenth century are silent on\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\nIn Germany there was a repetition in every respect of the same\r\nphenomena. The infallible signs of the oriental bubo-plague with its\r\ninevitable contagion were found there as everywhere else; but the\r\nmortality was not nearly so great as in the other parts of Europe[16].\r\nThe accounts do not all make mention of the spitting of blood, the\r\ndiagnostic symptom of this fatal pestilence; we are not, however,\r\nthence to conclude that there was any considerable mitigation or\r\nmodification of the disease, for we must not only take into account\r\nthe defectiveness of the chronicles, but that isolated testimonies are\r\noften contradicted by many others. Thus, the chronicles of Strasburg,\r\nwhich only take notice of boils and glandular swellings in the axillæ\r\nand groins[17], are opposed by another account, according to which the\r\nmortal spitting of blood was met with in Germany[18]; but this again is\r\nrendered suspicious, as the narrator postpones the death of those who\r\nwere thus affected, to the sixth, and (even the) eighth day, whereas,\r\nno other author sanctions so long a course of the disease; and even in\r\nStrasburg, where a mitigation of the plague may, with most probability,\r\nbe assumed, since in the year 1349, only 16,000 people were carried\r\noff, the generality expired by the third or fourth day[19]. In\r\nAustria, and especially in Vienna, the plague was fully as malignant\r\nas anywhere, so that the patients who had red spots and black boils,\r\nas well as those afflicted with tumid glands, died about the third\r\nday[20]; and lastly, very frequent sudden deaths occurred on the coasts\r\nof the North Sea and in Westphalia, without any further development of\r\nthe malady[21].\r\n\r\nTo France, this plague came in a northern direction from Avignon, and\r\nwas there more destructive than in Germany, so that in many places not\r\nmore than two in twenty of the inhabitants survived. Many were struck,\r\nas if by lightning, and died on the spot, and this more frequently\r\namong the young and strong than the old; patients with enlarged glands\r\nin the axillæ and groins scarcely survived two or three days: and no\r\nsooner did these fatal signs appear, than they bid adieu to the world,\r\nand sought consolation only in the absolution which Pope Clement VI.\r\npromised them in the hour of death[22].\r\n\r\nIn England the malady appeared, as at Avignon, with spitting of blood,\r\nand with the same fatality, so that the sick who were afflicted either\r\nwith this symptom or with vomiting of blood, died in some cases\r\nimmediately, in others within twelve hours, or at the latest, in two\r\ndays[23]. The inflammatory boils and buboes in the groins and axillæ\r\nwere recognised at once as prognosticating a fatal issue, and those\r\nwere past all hope of recovery in whom they arose in numbers all over\r\nthe body. It was not till towards the close of the plague that they\r\nventured to open, by incision, these hard and dry boils, when matter\r\nflowed from them in small quantity, and thus, by compelling nature to\r\na critical suppuration, many patients were saved. Every spot which the\r\nsick had touched, their breath, their clothes, spread the contagion;\r\nand, as in all other places, the attendants and friends who were either\r\nblind to their danger or heroically despised it, fell a sacrifice\r\nto their sympathy. Even the eyes of the patient were considered as\r\nsources of contagion[24], which had the power of acting at a distance,\r\nwhether on account of their unwonted lustre or the distortion which\r\nthey always suffer in plague, or whether in conformity with an ancient\r\nnotion, according to which the sight was considered as the bearer of a\r\ndemoniacal enchantment. Flight from infected cities seldom availed the\r\nfearful, for the germ of the disease adhered to them, and they fell\r\nsick, remote from assistance, in the solitude of their country houses.\r\n\r\nThus did the plague spread over England with unexampled rapidity,\r\nafter it had first broken out in the county of Dorset, whence it\r\nadvanced through the counties of Devon and Somerset, to Bristol, and\r\nthence reached Gloucester, Oxford and London. Probably few places\r\nescaped, perhaps not any; for the annals of contemporaries report that\r\nthroughout the land only a tenth part of the inhabitants remained\r\nalive[25].\r\n\r\nFrom England the contagion was carried by a ship to Bergen, the capital\r\nof Norway, where the plague then broke out in its most frightful form,\r\nwith vomiting of blood; and throughout the whole country, spared not\r\nmore than a third of the inhabitants. The sailors found no refuge in\r\ntheir ships; and vessels were often seen driving about on the ocean and\r\ndrifting on shore, whose crews had perished to the last man[26].\r\n\r\nIn Poland the infected were attacked with spitting of blood, and died\r\nin a few days in such vast numbers, that, as it has been affirmed,\r\nscarcely a fourth of the inhabitants were left[27].\r\n\r\nFinally, in Russia the plague appeared two years later than in Southern\r\nEurope; yet here again, with the same symptoms as elsewhere. Russian\r\ncontemporaries have recorded that it began with rigor, heat, and\r\ndarting pain in the shoulders and back; that it was accompanied by\r\nspitting of blood, and terminated fatally in two, or at most, three\r\ndays. It is not till the year 1360, that we find buboes mentioned as\r\noccurring in the neck, in the axillæ and in the groins, which are\r\nstated to have broken out when the spitting of blood had continued some\r\ntime. According to the experience of Western Europe, however, it cannot\r\nbe assumed that these symptoms did not appear at an earlier period[28].\r\n\r\nThus much, from authentic sources, on the nature of the Black Death.\r\nThe descriptions which have been communicated contain, with a few\r\nunimportant exceptions, all the symptoms of the oriental plague which\r\nhave been observed in more modern times. No doubt can obtain on this\r\npoint. The facts are placed clearly before our eyes. We must, however,\r\nbear in mind that this violent disease does not always appear in the\r\nsame form, and that while the essence of the poison which it produces,\r\nand which is separated so abundantly from the body of the patient,\r\nremains unchanged, it is proteiform in its varieties, from the almost\r\nimperceptible vesicle, unaccompanied by fever, which exists for some\r\ntime before it extends its poison inwardly, and then excites fever and\r\nbuboes, to the fatal form in which carbuncular inflammations fall upon\r\nthe most important viscera.\r\n\r\nSuch was the form which the plague assumed in the 14th century, for\r\nthe accompanying chest affection which appeared in all the countries\r\nwhereof we have received any account, cannot, on a comparison with\r\nsimilar and familiar symptoms, be considered as any other than the\r\ninflammation of the lungs of modern medicine[29], a disease which at\r\npresent only appears sporadically, and, owing to a putrid decomposition\r\nof the fluids, is probably combined with hemorrhages from the vessels\r\nof the lungs. Now, as every carbuncle, whether it be cutaneous or\r\ninternal, generates in abundance the matter of contagion which has\r\ngiven rise to it, so, therefore, must the breath of the affected\r\nhave been poisonous in this plague, and on this account its power\r\nof contagion wonderfully increased; wherefore the opinion appears\r\nincontrovertible, that owing to the accumulated numbers of the\r\ndiseased, not only individual chambers and houses, but whole cities\r\nwere infected, which, moreover, in the middle ages, were, with few\r\nexceptions, narrowly built, kept in a filthy state, and surrounded with\r\nstagnant ditches[30]. Flight was, in consequence, of no avail to the\r\ntimid; for even though they had sedulously avoided all communication\r\nwith the diseased and the suspected, yet their clothes were saturated\r\nwith the pestiferous atmosphere, and every inspiration imparted to\r\nthem the seeds of the destructive malady, which, in the greater number\r\nof cases, germinated with but too much fertility. Add to which, the\r\nusual propagation of the plague through clothes, beds, and a thousand\r\nother things to which the pestilential poison adheres,—a propagation,\r\nwhich, from want of caution, must have been infinitely multiplied;\r\nand since articles of this kind, removed from the access of air, not\r\nonly retain the matter of contagion for an indefinite period, but also\r\nincrease its activity and engender it like a living being, frightful\r\nill consequences followed for many years after the first fury of the\r\npestilence was past.\r\n\r\nThe affection of the stomach, often mentioned in vague terms, and\r\noccasionally as a vomiting of blood, was doubtless only a subordinate\r\nsymptom, even if it be admitted that actual hematemesis did occur. For\r\nthe difficulty of distinguishing a flow of blood from the stomach, from\r\na pulmonic expectoration of that fluid, is, to non-medical men, even in\r\ncommon cases, not inconsiderable. How much greater then must it have\r\nbeen in so terrible a disease, where assistants could not venture to\r\napproach the sick without exposing themselves to certain death? Only\r\ntwo medical descriptions of the malady have reached us, the one by the\r\nbrave _Guy de Chauliac_, the other by _Raymond Chalin de Vinario_, a\r\nvery experienced scholar, who was well versed in the learning of his\r\ntime. The former takes notice only of fatal coughing of blood; the\r\nlatter, besides this, notices epistaxis, hematuria and fluxes of blood\r\nfrom the bowels, as symptoms of such decided and speedy mortality, that\r\nthose patients in whom they were observed, usually died on the same or\r\nthe following day[31].\r\n\r\nThat a vomiting of blood may not, here and there, have taken\r\nplace, perhaps have been even prevalent in many places, is, from a\r\nconsideration of the nature of the disease, by no means to be denied;\r\nfor every putrid decomposition of the fluids begets a tendency to\r\nhemorrhages of all kinds. Here, however, it is a question of historical\r\ncertainty, which, after these doubts, is by no means established. Had\r\nnot so speedy a death followed the expectoration of blood, we should\r\ncertainly have received more detailed intelligence respecting other\r\nhemorrhages; but the malady had no time to extend its effects further\r\nover the extremities of the vessels. After its first fury, however,\r\nwas spent, the pestilence passed into the usual febrile form of the\r\noriental plague. Internal carbuncular inflammations no longer took\r\nplace, and hemorrhages became phenomena, no more essential in this\r\nthan they are in any other febrile disorders. Chalin, who observed\r\nnot only the _great mortality_ of 1348, and the plague of 1360, but\r\nalso that of 1373 and 1382, speaks moreover of _affections of the\r\nthroat_, and describes the _black spots_ of plague patients more\r\nsatisfactorily than any of his contemporaries. The former appeared but\r\nin few cases, and consisted in carbuncular inflammation of the gullet,\r\nwith a difficulty of swallowing, even to suffocation, to which, in\r\nsome instances, was added inflammation of the ceruminous glands of\r\nthe ears, with tumours, producing great deformity. Such patients, as\r\nwell as others, were affected with expectoration of blood; but they\r\ndid not usually die before the sixth, and sometimes, even so late as\r\nthe fourteenth day[32]. The same occurrence, it is well known, is not\r\nuncommon in other pestilences; as also blisters on the surface of the\r\nbody, in different places, in the vicinity of which, tumid glands and\r\ninflammatory boils, surrounded by discoloured and black streaks, arose,\r\nand thus indicated the reception of the poison. These streaked spots\r\nwere called, by an apt comparison, _the girdle_, and this appearance\r\nwas justly considered extremely dangerous[33].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                            CAUSES.—SPREAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn inquiry into the causes of the Black Death, will not be without\r\nimportant results in the study of the plagues which have visited\r\nthe world, although it cannot advance beyond generalization without\r\nentering upon a field hitherto uncultivated, and, to this hour,\r\nentirely unknown. Mighty revolutions in the organism of the earth, of\r\nwhich we have credible information, had preceded it. From China to the\r\nAtlantic, the foundations of the earth were shaken,—throughout Asia and\r\nEurope the atmosphere was in commotion, and endangered, by its baneful\r\ninfluence, both vegetable and animal life.\r\n\r\nThe series of these great events began in the year 1333, fifteen years\r\nbefore the plague broke out in Europe: they first appeared in China.\r\nHere a parching drought, accompanied by famine, commenced in the tract\r\nof country watered by the rivers Kiang and Hoai. This was followed\r\nby such violent torrents of rain, in and about Kingsai, at that time\r\nthe capital of the empire, that, according to tradition, more than\r\n400,000 people perished in the floods. Finally the mountain Tsincheou\r\nfell in, and vast clefts were formed in the earth. In the succeeding\r\nyear (1334), passing over fabulous traditions, the neighbourhood of\r\nCanton was visited by inundations; whilst in Tche, after an unexampled\r\ndrought, a plague arose, which is said to have carried off about\r\n5,000,000 of people. A few months afterwards an earthquake followed,\r\nat and near Kingsai; and subsequent to the falling in of the mountains\r\nof Ki-ming-chan, a lake was formed of more than a hundred leagues in\r\ncircumference, where, again, thousands found their grave. In Hou-kouang\r\nand Ho-nan, a drought prevailed for five months; and innumerable swarms\r\nof locusts destroyed the vegetation; while famine and pestilence, as\r\nusual, followed in their train. Connected accounts of the condition\r\nof Europe before this great catastrophe, are not to be expected from\r\nthe writers of the fourteenth century. It is remarkable, however,\r\nthat simultaneously with a drought and renewed floods in China, in\r\n1336, many uncommon atmospheric phenomena, and in the winter, frequent\r\nthunder storms, were observed in the north of France; and so early\r\nas the eventful year of 1333, an eruption of Etna took place[34].\r\nAccording to the Chinese annals, about 4,000,000 of people perished by\r\nfamine in the neighbourhood of Kiang in 1337: and deluges, swarms of\r\nlocusts, and an earthquake which lasted six days, caused incredible\r\ndevastation. In the same year, the first swarms of locusts appeared in\r\nFranconia, which were succeeded in the following year by myriads of\r\nthese insects. In 1338, Kingsai was visited by an earthquake of ten\r\ndays’ duration; at the same time France suffered from a failure in the\r\nharvest; and thenceforth, till the year 1342, there was in China, a\r\nconstant succession of inundations, earthquakes, and famines. In the\r\nsame year great floods occurred in the vicinity of the Rhine and in\r\nFrance, which could not be attributed to rain alone; for, everywhere,\r\neven on the tops of mountains, springs were seen to burst forth, and\r\ndry tracts were laid under water in an inexplicable manner. In the\r\nfollowing year, the mountain Hong-tchang, in China, fell in, and caused\r\na destructive deluge; and in Pien-tcheou and Leang-tcheou, after three\r\nmonths’ rain, there followed unheard-of inundations, which destroyed\r\nseven cities. In Egypt and Syria, violent earthquakes took place; and\r\nin China they became, from this time, more and more frequent; for\r\nthey recurred, in 1344, in Ven-tcheou, where the sea overflowed in\r\nconsequence; in 1345, in Ki-tcheou, and in both the following years\r\nin Canton, with subterraneous thunder. Meanwhile, floods and famine\r\ndevastated various districts, until 1347, when the fury of the elements\r\nsubsided in China[35].\r\n\r\nThe signs of terrestrial commotions commenced in Europe in the year\r\n1348, after the intervening districts of country in Asia had probably\r\nbeen visited in the same manner.\r\n\r\nOn the island of Cyprus, the plague from the East had already broken\r\nout; when an earthquake shook the foundations of the island, and was\r\naccompanied by so frightful a hurricane, that the inhabitants who had\r\nslain their Mahometan slaves, in order that they might not themselves\r\nbe subjugated by them, fled in dismay, in all directions. The sea\r\noverflowed—the ships were dashed to pieces on the rocks, and few\r\noutlived the terrific event, whereby this fertile and blooming island\r\nwas converted into a desert. Before the earthquake, a pestiferous wind\r\nspread so poisonous an odour, that many, being overpowered by it, fell\r\ndown suddenly and expired in dreadful agonies[36].\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon is one of the rarest that has ever been observed, for\r\nnothing is more constant than the composition of the air; and in no\r\nrespect has nature been more careful in the preservation of organic\r\nlife. Never have naturalists discovered in the atmosphere foreign\r\nelements, which, evident to the senses, and borne by the winds, spread\r\nfrom land to land, carrying disease over whole portions of the earth,\r\nas is recounted to have taken place in the year 1348. It is, therefore,\r\nthe more to be regretted, that in this extraordinary period, which,\r\nowing to the low condition of science, was very deficient in accurate\r\nobservers, so little that can be depended on respecting those uncommon\r\noccurrences in the air, should have been recorded. Yet, German accounts\r\nsay expressly, that a thick, stinking mist advanced from the East, and\r\nspread itself over Italy[37]; and there could be no deception in so\r\npalpable a phenomenon[38]. The credibility of unadorned traditions,\r\nhowever little they may satisfy physical research, can scarcely be\r\ncalled in question when we consider the connexion of events; for just\r\nat this time earthquakes were more general than they had been within\r\nthe range of history. In thousands of places chasms were formed, from\r\nwhence arose noxious vapours; and as at that time natural occurrences\r\nwere transformed into miracles, it was reported, that a fiery meteor,\r\nwhich descended on the earth far in the East, had destroyed every\r\nthing within a circumference of more than a hundred leagues, infecting\r\nthe air far and wide[39]. The consequences of innumerable floods\r\ncontributed to the same effect; vast river districts had been converted\r\ninto swamps; foul vapours arose everywhere, increased by the odour of\r\nputrified locusts, which had never perhaps darkened the sun in thicker\r\nswarms[40], and of countless corpses, which, even in the well regulated\r\ncountries of Europe, they knew not how to remove quickly enough out of\r\nthe sight of the living. It is probable, therefore, that the atmosphere\r\ncontained foreign, and sensibly perceptible, admixtures to a great\r\nextent, which, at least in the lower regions, could not be decomposed,\r\nor rendered ineffective by separation.\r\n\r\nNow, if we go back to the symptoms of the disease, the ardent\r\ninflammation of the lungs points out, that the organs of respiration\r\nyielded to the attack of an atmospheric poison—a poison, which, if we\r\nadmit the independent origin of the Black Plague at any one place on\r\nthe globe, which, under such extraordinary circumstances, it would\r\nbe difficult to doubt, attacked the course of the circulation in as\r\nhostile a manner as that which produces inflammation of the spleen, and\r\nother animal contagions that cause swelling and inflammation of the\r\nlymphatic glands.\r\n\r\nPursuing the course of these grand revolutions further, we find notice\r\nof an unexampled earthquake, which, on the 25th of January, 1348, shook\r\nGreece, Italy, and the neighbouring countries. Naples, Rome, Pisa,\r\nBologna, Padua, Venice and many other cities suffered considerably:\r\nwhole villages were swallowed up. Castles, houses and churches were\r\noverthrown, and hundreds of people were buried beneath their ruins[41].\r\nIn Carinthia, thirty villages, together with all the churches, were\r\ndemolished; more than a thousand corpses were drawn out of the rubbish;\r\nthe city of Villach was so completely destroyed, that very few of\r\nits inhabitants were saved; and when the earth ceased to tremble, it\r\nwas found that mountains had been moved from their positions, and\r\nthat many hamlets were left in ruins[42]. It is recorded that, during\r\nthis earthquake, the wine in the casks became turbid, a statement\r\nwhich may be considered as furnishing a proof, that changes causing a\r\ndecomposition of the atmosphere had taken place; but if we had no other\r\ninformation from which the excitement of conflicting powers of nature\r\nduring these commotions might be inferred, yet scientific observations\r\nin modern times have shewn, that the relation of the atmosphere to the\r\nearth is changed by volcanic influences. Why then, may we not, from\r\nthis fact, draw retrospective inferences respecting those extraordinary\r\nphenomena?\r\n\r\nIndependently of this, however, we know that during this earthquake,\r\nthe duration of which is stated by some to have been a week, and by\r\nothers a fortnight, people experienced an unusual stupor and headache,\r\nand that many fainted away[43].\r\n\r\nThese destructive earthquakes extended as far as the neighbourhood\r\nof Basle[44], and recurred until the year 1360, throughout Germany,\r\nFrance, Silesia, Poland, England and Denmark, and much further\r\nnorth[45].\r\n\r\nGreat and extraordinary meteors appeared in many places, and were\r\nregarded with superstitious horror. A pillar of fire, which on the 20th\r\nof December, 1348, remained for an hour at sunrise over the pope’s\r\npalace in Avignon[46]; a fireball, which in August of the same year\r\nwas seen at sunset over Paris, and was distinguished from similar\r\nphenomena, by its longer duration[47], not to mention other instances\r\nmixed up with wonderful prophecies and omens, are recorded in the\r\nchronicles of that age.\r\n\r\nThe order of the seasons seemed to be inverted,—rains, floods and\r\nfailures in crops were so general, that few places were exempt from\r\nthem; and though an historian of this century assures us, that there\r\nwas an abundance in the granaries and storehouses[48], all his\r\ncontemporaries, with one voice, contradict him. The consequences of\r\nfailure in the crops were soon felt, especially in Italy and the\r\nsurrounding countries, where, in this year, a rain which continued for\r\nfour months, had destroyed the seed. In the larger cities, they were\r\ncompelled, in the spring of 1347, to have recourse to a distribution\r\nof bread among the poor, particularly at Florence, where they erected\r\nlarge bake-houses, from which, in April, ninety-four thousand loaves of\r\nbread, each of twelve ounces in weight, were daily dispensed[49]. It is\r\nplain, however, that humanity could only partially mitigate the general\r\ndistress, not altogether obviate it.\r\n\r\nDiseases, the invariable consequence of famine, broke out in the\r\ncountry, as well as in cities; children died of hunger in their\r\nmothers’ arms,—want, misery and despair, were general throughout\r\nChristendom[50].\r\n\r\nSuch are the events which took place before the eruption of the\r\nBlack Plague in Europe. Contemporaries have explained them after\r\ntheir own manner, and have thus, like their posterity, under similar\r\ncircumstances, given a proof, that mortals possess neither senses nor\r\nintellectual powers sufficiently acute to comprehend the phenomena\r\nproduced by the earth’s organism, much less scientifically to\r\nunderstand their effects. Superstition, selfishness in a thousand\r\nforms, the presumption of the schools, laid hold of unconnected facts.\r\nThey vainly thought to comprehend the whole in the individual, and\r\nperceived not the universal spirit which, in intimate union with the\r\nmighty powers of nature, animates the movements of all existence,\r\nand permits not any phenomenon to originate from isolated causes. To\r\nattempt, five centuries after that age of desolation, to point out the\r\ncauses of a cosmical commotion, which has never recurred to an equal\r\nextent,—to indicate scientifically the influences which called forth so\r\nterrific a poison in the bodies of men and animals, exceeds the limits\r\nof human understanding. If we are even now unable, with all the varied\r\nresources of an extended knowledge of nature, to define that condition\r\nof the atmosphere by which pestilences are generated, still less can we\r\npretend to reason retrospectively from the nineteenth to the fourteenth\r\ncentury; but if we take a general view of the occurrences, that century\r\nwill give us copious information, and, as applicable to all succeeding\r\ntimes, of high importance.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of connected natural phenomena, from East to West,\r\nthat great law of nature is plainly revealed which has so often and\r\nevidently manifested itself in the earth’s organism, as well as in\r\nthe state of nations dependent upon it. In the inmost depths of the\r\nglobe, that impulse was given in the year 1333, which in uninterrupted\r\nsuccession for six-and-twenty years shook the surface of the earth,\r\neven to the western shores of Europe. From the very beginning the\r\nair partook of the terrestrial concussion, atmospherical waters\r\noverflowed the land, or its plants and animals perished under the\r\nscorching heat. The insect tribe was wonderfully called into life, as\r\nif animated beings were destined to complete the destruction which\r\nastral and telluric powers had begun. Thus did this dreadful work of\r\nnature advance from year to year; it was a progressive infection of the\r\nZones, which exerted a powerful influence both above and beneath the\r\nsurface of the earth; and after having been perceptible in slighter\r\nindications, at the commencement of the terrestrial commotions in\r\nChina, convulsed the whole earth.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the first plague in China is unknown. We have no certain\r\nintelligence of the disease, until it entered the western countries of\r\nAsia. Here it shewed itself as the oriental plague with inflammation\r\nof the lungs; in which form it probably also may have begun in China,\r\nthat is to say, as a malady which spreads, more than any other,\r\nby contagion—a contagion, that, in ordinary pestilences, requires\r\nimmediate contact, and only under unfavourable circumstances of rare\r\noccurrence is communicated by the mere approach to the sick. The share\r\nwhich this cause had in the spreading of the plague over the whole\r\nearth, was certainly very great: and the opinion that the Black Death\r\nmight have been excluded from Western Europe, by good regulations,\r\nsimilar to those which are now in use, would have all the support of\r\nmodern experience, provided it could be proved that this plague had\r\nbeen actually imported from the East; or that the oriental plague in\r\ngeneral, whenever it appears in Europe, has its origin in Asia or\r\nEgypt. Such a proof, however, can by no means be produced so as to\r\nenforce conviction; for it would involve the impossible assumption,\r\neither that there is no essential difference between the degree of\r\ncivilization of the European nations, in the most ancient and in modern\r\ntimes, or that detrimental circumstances, which have yielded only to\r\nthe civilization of human society and the regular cultivation of\r\ncountries, could not formerly keep up the glandular plague.\r\n\r\nThe plague was, however, known in Europe before nations were united\r\nby the bonds of commerce and social intercourse[51]; hence there is\r\nground for supposing that it sprung up spontaneously, in consequence\r\nof the rude manner of living and the uncultivated state of the earth;\r\ninfluences which peculiarly favour the origin of severe diseases. Now,\r\nwe need not go back to the earlier centuries, for the 14th itself,\r\nbefore it had half expired, was visited by five or six pestilences[52].\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, we consider the peculiar property of the plague, that,\r\nin countries which it has once visited, it remains for a long time\r\nin a milder form, and that the epidemic influences of 1342, when it\r\nhad appeared for the last time, were particularly favourable to its\r\nunperceived continuance, till 1348, we come to the notion, that in\r\nthis eventful year also, the germs of plague existed in Southern\r\nEurope, which might be vivified by atmospherical deteriorations; and\r\nthat thus, at least in part, the Black Plague may have originated in\r\nEurope itself. The corruption of the atmosphere came from the East; but\r\nthe disease itself came not upon the wings of the wind, but was only\r\nexcited and increased by the atmosphere where it had previously existed.\r\n\r\nThis source of the Black Plague was not, however, the only one; for,\r\nfar more powerful than the excitement of the latent elements of the\r\nplague by atmospheric influences, was the effect of the contagion\r\ncommunicated from one people to another, on the great roads, and\r\nin the harbours of the Mediterranean. From China, the route of the\r\ncaravans lay to the north of the Caspian Sea, through Central Asia,\r\nto Tauris. Here ships were ready to take the produce of the East to\r\nConstantinople, the capital of commerce, and the medium of connexion\r\nbetween Asia, Europe and Africa[53]. Other caravans went from India\r\nto Asia Minor, and touched at the cities south of the Caspian Sea,\r\nand lastly from Bagdad, through Arabia to Egypt; also the maritime\r\ncommunication on the Red Sea, from India to Arabia and Egypt, was\r\nnot inconsiderable. In all these directions contagion made its way;\r\nand doubtless, Constantinople and the harbours of Asia Minor, are to\r\nbe regarded as the foci of infection; whence it radiated to the most\r\ndistant seaports and islands.\r\n\r\nTo Constantinople, the plague had been brought from the northern coast\r\nof the Black Sea[54], after it had depopulated the countries between\r\nthose routes of commerce; and appeared as early as 1347, in Cyprus,\r\nSicily, Marseilles and some of the seaports of Italy. The remaining\r\nislands of the Mediterranean, particularly Sardinia, Corsica and\r\nMajorca, were visited in succession. Foci of contagion existed also\r\nin full activity along the whole southern coast of Europe; when, in\r\nJanuary 1348, the plague appeared in Avignon[55], and in other cities\r\nin the south of France and north of Italy, as well as in Spain.\r\n\r\nThe precise days of its eruption in the individual towns, are no longer\r\nto be ascertained; but it was not simultaneous; for in Florence, the\r\ndisease appeared in the beginning of April[56]; in Cesena, the 1st\r\nof June[57]; and place after place was attacked throughout the whole\r\nyear; so that the plague, after it had passed through the whole of\r\nFrance and Germany, where, however, it did not make its ravages until\r\nthe following year, did not break out till August, in England; where\r\nit advanced so gradually, that a period of three months elapsed before\r\nit reached London[58]. The northern kingdoms were attacked by it in\r\n1349. Sweden, indeed, not until November of that year: almost two years\r\nafter its eruption in Avignon[59]. Poland received the plague in 1349,\r\nprobably from Germany[60], if not from the northern countries; but in\r\nRussia, it did not make its appearance until 1351, more than three\r\nyears after it had broken out in Constantinople. Instead of advancing\r\nin a north-westerly direction from Tauris and from the Caspian Sea,\r\nit had thus made the great circuit of the Black Sea, by way of\r\nConstantinople, Southern and Central Europe, England, the northern\r\nkingdoms and Poland, before it reached the Russian territories; a\r\nphenomenon which has not again occurred with respect to more recent\r\npestilences originating in Asia.\r\n\r\nWhether any difference existed between the indigenous plague, excited\r\nby the influence of the atmosphere, and that which was imported\r\nby contagion, can no longer be ascertained from facts; for the\r\ncontemporaries, who in general were not competent to make accurate\r\nresearches of this kind, have left no data on the subject. A milder\r\nand a more malignant form certainly existed, and the former was\r\nnot always derived from the latter, as is to be supposed from this\r\ncircumstance—that the spitting of blood, the infallible diagnostic of\r\nthe latter, on the first breaking out of the plague, is not similarly\r\nmentioned in all the reports; and it is therefore probable, that the\r\nmilder form belonged to the native plague,—the more malignant, to that\r\nintroduced by contagion. Contagion was, however, in itself, only one of\r\nmany causes which gave rise to the Black Plague.\r\n\r\nThis disease was a consequence of violent commotions in the earth’s\r\norganism—if any disease of cosmical origin can be so considered. One\r\nspring set a thousand others in motion for the annihilation of living\r\nbeings, transient or permanent, of mediate or immediate effect. The\r\nmost powerful of all was contagion; for in the most distant countries\r\nwhich had scarcely yet heard the echo of the first concussion, the\r\npeople fell a sacrifice to organic poison,—the untimely offspring of\r\nvital energies thrown into violent commotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                              MORTALITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have no certain measure by which to estimate the ravages of the\r\nBlack Plague, if numerical statements were wanted, as in modern times.\r\nLet us go back for a moment to the 14th century. The people were yet\r\nbut little civilized. The church had indeed subdued them; but they\r\nall suffered from the ill consequences of their original rudeness. The\r\ndominion of the law was not yet confirmed. Sovereigns had everywhere\r\nto combat powerful enemies to internal tranquillity and security.\r\nThe cities were fortresses for their own defence. Marauders encamped\r\non the roads.—The husbandman was a feodal slave, without possessions\r\nof his own.—Rudeness was general.—Humanity, as yet unknown to the\r\npeople.—Witches and heretics were burned alive.—Gentle rulers were\r\ncontemned as weak;—wild passions, severity and cruelty, everywhere\r\npredominated.—Human life was little regarded.—Governments concerned\r\nnot themselves about the numbers of their subjects, for whose welfare\r\nit was incumbent on them to provide. Thus, the first requisite for\r\nestimating the loss of human life, namely, a knowledge of the amount of\r\nthe population, is altogether wanting; and, moreover, the traditional\r\nstatements of the amount of this loss, are so vague, that from this\r\nsource likewise, there is only room for probable conjecture.\r\n\r\nKairo lost daily, when the plague was raging with its greatest\r\nviolence, from 10 to 15,000; being as many as, in modern times,\r\ngreat plagues have carried off during their whole course. In China,\r\nmore than thirteen millions are said to have died; and this is in\r\ncorrespondence with the certainly exaggerated accounts from the rest of\r\nAsia. India was depopulated. Tartary, the Tartar kingdom of Kaptschak,\r\nMesopotamia, Syria, Armenia, were covered with dead bodies—the Kurds\r\nfled in vain to the mountains. In Caramania and Cæsarea, none were\r\nleft alive. On the roads,—in the camps,—in the caravansaries,—unburied\r\nbodies alone were seen; and a few cities only (Arabian historians name\r\nMaara el nooman, Schisur and Harem) remained, in an unaccountable\r\nmanner, free. In Aleppo, 500 died daily; 22,000 people, and most of\r\nthe animals, were carried off in Gaza, within six weeks. Cyprus lost\r\nalmost all its inhabitants[61]; and ships without crews were often\r\nseen in the Mediterranean; as afterwards in the North Sea, driving\r\nabout, and spreading the plague wherever they went on shore[62]. It\r\nwas reported to Pope Clement, at Avignon, that throughout the East,\r\nprobably with the exception of China, 23,840,000 people had fallen\r\nvictims to the plague[63]. Considering the occurrences of the 14th\r\nand 15th centuries, we might, on first view, suspect the accuracy of\r\nthis statement. How (it might be asked) could such great wars have been\r\ncarried on—such powerful efforts have been made; how could the Greek\r\nempire, only a hundred years later, have been overthrown, if the people\r\nreally had been so utterly destroyed?\r\n\r\nThis account is nevertheless rendered credible by the ascertained fact,\r\nthat the palaces of princes are less accessible to contagious diseases\r\nthan the dwellings of the multitude; and that in places of importance,\r\nthe influx from those districts which have suffered least, soon repairs\r\neven the heaviest losses. We must remember, also, that we do not gather\r\nmuch from mere numbers without an intimate knowledge of the state of\r\nsociety. We will, therefore, confine ourselves to exhibiting some of\r\nthe more credible accounts relative to European cities.\r\n\r\n  In Florence there died of the Black Plague     60,000[64]\r\n  In Venice                                     100,000[65]\r\n  In Marseilles, in one month                    16,000[66]\r\n  In Siena                                       70,000[67]\r\n  In Paris                                       50,000[68]\r\n  In St. Denys                                   14,000[69]\r\n  In Avignon                                     60,000[70]\r\n  In Strasburg                                   16,000[71]\r\n  In Lübeck                                       9,000[72]\r\n  In Basle                                       14,000\r\n  In Erfurt, at least                            16,000\r\n  In Weimar                                       5,000[73]\r\n  In Limburg                                      2,500[74]\r\n  In London, at least                           100,000[75]\r\n  In Norwich                                     51,100[76]\r\n    To which may be added—\r\n  Franciscan Friars in Germany                  124,434[77]\r\n  Minorites in Italy                             30,000[78]\r\n\r\nThis short catalogue might, by a laborious and uncertain calculation,\r\ndeduced from other sources, be easily further multiplied, but would\r\nstill fail to give a true picture of the depopulation which took\r\nplace. Lübeck, at that time the Venice of the North, which could no\r\nlonger contain the multitudes that flocked to it, was thrown into\r\nsuch consternation on the eruption of the plague, that the citizens\r\ndestroyed themselves as if in frenzy.\r\n\r\nMerchants whose earnings and possessions were unbounded, coldly and\r\nwillingly renounced their earthly goods. They carried their treasures\r\nto monasteries and churches, and laid them at the foot of the altar;\r\nbut gold had no charms for the monks, for it brought them death. They\r\nshut their gates; yet, still it was cast to them over the convent\r\nwalls. People would brook no impediment to the last pious work to which\r\nthey were driven by despair. When the plague ceased, men thought they\r\nwere still wandering among the dead, so appalling was the livid aspect\r\nof the survivors, in consequence of the anxiety they had undergone,\r\nand the unavoidable infection of the air[79]. Many other cities\r\nprobably presented a similar appearance; and it is ascertained that\r\na great number of small country towns and villages which have been\r\nestimated, and not too highly, at 200,000[80], were bereft of all their\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nIn many places in France not more than two out of twenty of the\r\ninhabitants were left alive[81], and the capital felt the fury of the\r\nplague, alike in the palace and the cot.\r\n\r\nTwo queens[82], one bishop[83], and great numbers of other\r\ndistinguished persons, fell a sacrifice to it, and more than 500 a\r\nday died in the Hôtel-Dieu, under the faithful care of the sisters of\r\ncharity, whose disinterested courage, in this age of horror, displayed\r\nthe most beautiful traits of human virtue. For although they lost their\r\nlives, evidently from contagion, and their numbers were several times\r\nrenewed, there was still no want of fresh candidates, who, strangers to\r\nthe unchristian fear of death, piously devoted themselves to their holy\r\ncalling.\r\n\r\nThe churchyards were soon unable to contain the dead[84], and many\r\nhouses, left without inhabitants, fell to ruins.\r\n\r\nIn Avignon, the pope found it necessary to consecrate the Rhone, that\r\nbodies might be thrown into the river without delay, as the churchyards\r\nwould no longer hold them[85]; so likewise, in all populous cities,\r\nextraordinary measures were adopted, in order speedily to dispose\r\nof the dead. In Vienna, where for some time 1200 inhabitants died\r\ndaily[86], the interment of corpses in the churchyards and within the\r\nchurches, was forthwith prohibited; and the dead were then arranged in\r\nlayers, by thousands, in six large pits outside the city[87], as had\r\nalready been done in Cairo, and Paris. Yet, still many were secretly\r\nburied; for at all times, the people are attached to the consecrated\r\ncemeteries of their dead, and will not renounce the customary mode of\r\ninterment.\r\n\r\nIn many places, it was rumoured that plague patients were buried\r\nalive[88], as may sometimes happen through senseless alarm and indecent\r\nhaste; and thus the horror of the distressed people was everywhere\r\nincreased. In Erfurt, after the churchyards were filled, 12,000 corpses\r\nwere thrown into eleven great pits; and the like might, more or less\r\nexactly, be stated with respect to all the larger cities[89]. Funeral\r\nceremonies, the last consolation of the survivors, were everywhere\r\nimpracticable.\r\n\r\nIn all Germany, according to a probable calculation, there seem to have\r\ndied only 1,244,434[90] inhabitants; this country, however, was more\r\nspared than others: Italy, on the contrary, was most severely visited.\r\nIt is said to have lost half its inhabitants[91]; and this account is\r\nrendered credible from the immense losses of individual cities and\r\nprovinces: for in Sardinia and Corsica, according to the account of the\r\ndistinguished Florentine, John Villani, who was himself carried off by\r\nthe Black Plague[92], scarcely a third part of the population remained\r\nalive; and it is related of the Venetians, that they engaged ships at\r\na high rate to retreat to the islands; so that after the plague had\r\ncarried off three fourths of her inhabitants, that proud city was left\r\nforlorn and desolate[93]. In Padua, after the cessation of the plague,\r\ntwo thirds of the inhabitants were wanting; and in Florence it was\r\nprohibited to publish the numbers of the dead, and to toll the bells at\r\ntheir funerals, in order that the living might not abandon themselves\r\nto despair[94].\r\n\r\nWe have more exact accounts of England; most of the great cities\r\nsuffered incredible losses; above all, Yarmouth, in which, 7052 died:\r\nBristol, Oxford, Norwich, Leicester, York and London where, in one\r\nburial ground alone, there were interred upwards of 50,000 corpses,\r\narranged in layers, in large pits[95]. It is said, that in the whole\r\ncountry, scarcely a tenth part remained alive[96]; but this estimate\r\nis evidently too high. Smaller losses were sufficient to cause those\r\nconvulsions, whose consequences were felt for some centuries, in a\r\nfalse impulse given to civil life, and whose indirect influence,\r\nunknown to the English, has, perhaps, extended even to modern times.\r\n\r\nMorals were deteriorated everywhere, and the service of God was, in\r\na great measure, laid aside; for, in many places, the churches were\r\ndeserted, being bereft of their priests. The instruction of the people\r\nwas impeded[97]; covetousness became general; and when tranquillity\r\nwas restored, the great increase of lawyers was astonishing, to whom\r\nthe endless disputes regarding inheritances, offered a rich harvest.\r\nThe want of priests too, throughout the country, operated very\r\ndetrimentally upon the people, (the lower classes being most exposed\r\nto the ravages of the plague, whilst the houses of the nobility\r\nwere, in proportion, much more spared,) and it was no compensation\r\nthat whole bands of ignorant laymen, who had lost their wives during\r\nthe pestilence, crowded into the monastic orders, that they might\r\nparticipate in the respectability of the priesthood, and in the rich\r\nheritages which fell in to the church from all quarters. The sittings\r\nof Parliament, of the King’s Bench, and of most of the other courts,\r\nwere suspended as long as the malady raged. The laws of peace availed\r\nnot during the dominion of death. Pope Clement took advantage of this\r\nstate of disorder, to adjust the bloody quarrel between Edward III.\r\nand Philip VI.; yet he only succeeded during the period that the\r\nplague commanded peace. Philip’s death (1350) annulled all treaties;\r\nand it is related, that Edward, with other troops indeed, but with\r\nthe same leaders and knights, again took the field. Ireland was much\r\nless heavily visited than England. The disease seems to have scarcely\r\nreached the mountainous districts of that kingdom; and Scotland\r\ntoo would, perhaps, have remained free, had not the Scots availed\r\nthemselves of the discomfiture of the English, to make an irruption\r\ninto their territory, which terminated in the destruction of their\r\narmy, by the plague and by the sword, and the extension of the\r\npestilence, through those who escaped, over the whole country.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement, there was in England a superabundance of all the\r\nnecessaries of life; but the plague, which seemed then to be the sole\r\ndisease, was soon accompanied by a fatal murrain among the cattle.\r\nWandering about without herdsmen, they fell by thousands; and, as\r\nhas likewise been observed in Africa, the birds and beasts of prey\r\nare said not to have touched them. Of what nature this murrain may\r\nhave been, can no more be determined, than whether it originated from\r\ncommunication with plague patients, or from other causes; but thus much\r\nis certain, that it did not break out until after the commencement of\r\nthe Black Death. In consequence of this murrain, and the impossibility\r\nof removing the corn from the fields, there was everywhere a great\r\nrise in the price of food which to many was inexplicable, because the\r\nharvest had been plentiful; by others it was attributed to the wicked\r\ndesigns of the labourers and dealers; but it really had its foundation\r\nin the actual deficiency arising from circumstances by which individual\r\nclasses at all times endeavour to profit. For a whole year, until\r\nit terminated in August, 1349, the Black Plague prevailed in this\r\nbeautiful island, and everywhere poisoned the springs of comfort and\r\nprosperity[98].\r\n\r\nIn other countries, it generally lasted only half a year, but returned\r\nfrequently in individual places; on which account, some, without\r\nsufficient proof, assigned to it a period of seven years[99].\r\n\r\nSpain was uninterruptedly ravaged by the Black Plague till after the\r\nyear 1350, to which the frequent internal feuds and the wars with the\r\nMoors not a little contributed. Alphonso XI., whose passion for war\r\ncarried him too far, died of it at the siege of Gibraltar, on the 26th\r\nof March, 1350. He was the only king in Europe who fell a sacrifice to\r\nit; but even before this period, innumerable families had been thrown\r\ninto affliction[100]. The mortality seems otherwise to have been\r\nsmaller in Spain than in Italy, and about as considerable as in France.\r\n\r\nThe whole period during which the Black Plague raged with destructive\r\nviolence in Europe, was, with the exception of Russia, from the year\r\n1347 to 1350. The plagues, which in the sequel often returned until\r\nthe year 1383[101], we do not consider as belonging to “the Great\r\nMortality.” They were rather common pestilences, without inflammation\r\nof the lungs, such as in former times, and in the following centuries,\r\nwere excited by the matter of contagion everywhere existing, and which,\r\non every favourable occasion, gained ground anew, as is usually the\r\ncase with this frightful disease.\r\n\r\nThe concourse of large bodies of people was especially dangerous; and\r\nthus, the premature celebration of the Jubilee, to which Clement VI.\r\ncited the faithful to Rome, (1350,) during the great epidemic, caused a\r\nnew eruption of the plague, from which it is said, that scarcely one in\r\nan hundred of the pilgrims escaped[102].\r\n\r\nItaly was, in consequence, depopulated anew; and those who returned,\r\nspread poison and corruption of morals in all directions[103]. It is,\r\ntherefore, the less apparent, how that Pope, who was in general so wise\r\nand considerate, and who knew how to pursue the path of reason and\r\nhumanity, under the most difficult circumstances, should have been led\r\nto adopt a measure so injurious; since he, himself, was so convinced of\r\nthe salutary effect of seclusion, that during the plague in Avignon, he\r\nkept up constant fires, and suffered no one to approach him[104]; and,\r\nin other respects, gave such orders as averted, or alleviated, much\r\nmisery.\r\n\r\nThe changes which occurred about this period in the north of Europe,\r\nare sufficiently memorable to claim a few moments’ attention. In Sweden\r\ntwo princes died—Håken and Knut, half-brothers of King Magnus; and in\r\nWestgothland alone, 466 priests[105]. The inhabitants of Iceland and\r\nGreenland, found in the coldness of their inhospitable climate, no\r\nprotection against the southern enemy who had penetrated to them from\r\nhappier countries. The plague caused great havoc among them. Nature\r\nmade no allowance for their constant warfare with the elements, and\r\nthe parsimony with which she had meted out to them the enjoyments of\r\nlife[106]. In Denmark and Norway, however, people were so occupied\r\nwith their own misery, that the accustomed voyages to Greenland\r\nceased. Towering icebergs formed at the same time on the coast of East\r\nGreenland, in consequence of the general concussion of the earth’s\r\norganism; and no mortal, from that time forward, has ever seen that\r\nshore or its inhabitants[107].\r\n\r\nIt has been observed above, that in Russia, the Black Plague did\r\nnot break out until 1351, after it had already passed through the\r\nsouth and north of Europe. In this country also, the mortality was\r\nextraordinarily great; and the same scenes of affliction and despair\r\nwere exhibited, as had occurred in those nations which had already\r\npassed the ordeal. The same mode of burial—the same horrible certainty\r\nof death—the same torpor and depression of spirits. The wealthy\r\nabandoned their treasures, and gave their villages and estates to\r\nthe churches and monasteries; this being, according to the notions\r\nof the age, the surest way of securing the favour of Heaven and the\r\nforgiveness of past sins. In Russia too, the voice of nature was\r\nsilenced by fear and horror. In the hour of danger, fathers and mothers\r\ndeserted their children, and children their parents[108].\r\n\r\nOf all the estimates of the number of lives lost in Europe, the most\r\nprobable is, that altogether, a fourth part of the inhabitants were\r\ncarried off. Now, if Europe at present contain 210,000,000 inhabitants,\r\nthe population, not to take a higher estimate, which might easily be\r\njustified, amounted to at least 105,000,000 in the 16th century.\r\n\r\nIt may, therefore, be assumed, without exaggeration, that Europe lost\r\nduring the Black Death, 25,000,000 of inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThat her nations could so quickly overcome such a fearful concussion\r\nin their external circumstances, and, in general, without retrograding\r\nmore than they actually did, could so develope their energies in the\r\nfollowing century, is a most convincing proof of the indestructibility\r\nof human society as a whole. To assume, however, that it did not\r\nsuffer any essential change internally, because in appearance every\r\nthing remained as before, is inconsistent with a just view of cause\r\nand effect. Many historians seem to have adopted such an opinion;\r\naccustomed, as usual, to judge of the moral condition of the people\r\nsolely according to the vicissitudes of earthly power, the events\r\nof battles, and the influence of religion, but to pass over with\r\nindifference, the great phenomena of nature, which modify, not only the\r\nsurface of the earth, but also the human mind. Hence, most of them have\r\ntouched but superficially on the “great mortality” of the 14th century.\r\nWe, for our parts, are convinced, that in the history of the world, the\r\nBlack Death is one of the most important events which have prepared the\r\nway for the present state of Europe.\r\n\r\nHe who studies the human mind with attention, and forms a deliberate\r\njudgment on the intellectual powers which set people and states in\r\nmotion, may, perhaps, find some proofs of this assertion in the\r\nfollowing observations:—at that time, the advancement of the hierarchy\r\nwas, in most countries, extraordinary; for the church acquired\r\ntreasures and large properties in land, even to a greater extent than\r\nafter the crusades; but experience has demonstrated, that such a state\r\nof things is ruinous to the people, and causes them to retrograde, as\r\nwas evinced on this occasion.\r\n\r\nAfter the cessation of the Black Plague, a greater fecundity in\r\nwomen was everywhere remarkable—a grand phenomenon, which, from its\r\noccurrence after every destructive pestilence, proves to conviction,\r\nif any occurrence can do so, the prevalence of a higher power in the\r\ndirection of general organic life. Marriages were, almost without\r\nexception, prolific; and double and treble births were more frequent\r\nthan at other times; under which head, we should remember the strange\r\nremark, that after the “great mortality” the children were said to have\r\ngot fewer teeth than before; at which contemporaries were mightily\r\nshocked, and even later writers have felt surprise.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the grounds of this oft-repeated assertion, we shall\r\nfind that they were astonished to see children cut twenty, or at most,\r\ntwenty-two teeth, under the supposition that a greater number had\r\nformerly fallen to their share[109]. Some writers of authority, as,\r\nfor example, the physician Savonarola[110], at Ferrara, who probably\r\nlooked for twenty-eight teeth in children, published their opinions on\r\nthis subject. Others copied from them, without seeing for themselves,\r\nas often happens in other matters which are equally evident; and thus\r\nthe world believed in the miracle of an imperfection in the human body\r\nwhich had been caused by the Black Plague.\r\n\r\nThe people gradually consoled themselves after the sufferings which\r\nthey had undergone; the dead were lamented and forgotten; and in\r\nthe stirring vicissitudes of existence, the world belonged to the\r\nliving[111].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                            MORAL EFFECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mental shock sustained by all nations during the prevalence of the\r\nBlack Plague, is without parallel and beyond description. In the eyes\r\nof the timorous, danger was the certain harbinger of death; many fell\r\nvictims to fear, on the first appearance of the distemper[112], and\r\nthe most stout-hearted lost their confidence. Thus, after reliance on\r\nthe future had died away, the spiritual union which binds man to his\r\nfamily and his fellow creatures, was gradually dissolved. The pious\r\nclosed their accounts with the world,—eternity presented itself to\r\ntheir view,—their only remaining desire, was for a participation in\r\nthe consolations of religion, because to them death was disarmed of\r\nits sting.\r\n\r\nRepentance seized the transgressor, admonishing him to consecrate his\r\nremaining hours to the exercise of Christian virtues. All minds were\r\ndirected to the contemplation of futurity; and children, who manifest\r\nthe more elevated feelings of the soul without alloy, were frequently\r\nseen, while labouring under the plague, breathing out their spirit with\r\nprayer and songs of thanksgiving[113].\r\n\r\nAn awful sense of contrition seized Christians of every communion; they\r\nresolved to forsake their vices, to make restitution for past offences,\r\nbefore they were summoned hence, to seek reconciliation with their\r\nMaker, and to avert, by self-chastisement, the punishment due to their\r\nformer sins. Human nature would be exalted, could the countless noble\r\nactions, which, in times of most imminent danger, were performed in\r\nsecret, be recorded for the instruction of future generations. They,\r\nhowever, have no influence on the course of worldly events. They are\r\nknown only to silent eye-witnesses, and soon fall into oblivion. But\r\nhypocrisy, illusion and bigotry, stalk abroad undaunted; they desecrate\r\nwhat is noble, they pervert what is divine, to the unholy purposes\r\nof selfishness; which hurries along every good feeling in the false\r\nexcitement of the age. Thus it was in the years of this plague. In the\r\n14th century, the monastic system was still in its full vigour, the\r\npower of the ecclesiastical orders and brotherhoods was revered by the\r\npeople, and the hierarchy was still formidable to the temporal power.\r\nIt was, therefore, in the natural constitution of society that bigoted\r\nzeal, which in such times makes a show of public acts of penance,\r\nshould avail itself of the semblance of religion. But this took place\r\nin such a manner, that unbridled, self-willed penitence, degenerated\r\ninto lukewarmness, renounced obedience to the hierarchy, and prepared\r\na fearful opposition to the church, paralysed as it was by antiquated\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nWhile all countries were filled with lamentations and woe, there first\r\narose in Hungary[114], and afterwards in Germany, the Brotherhood\r\nof the Flagellants, called also the Brethren of the Cross, or\r\nCross-bearers, who took upon themselves the repentance of the people,\r\nfor the sins they had committed, and offered prayers and supplications\r\nfor the averting of this plague. This Order consisted chiefly of\r\npersons of the lower class, who were either actuated by sincere\r\ncontrition, or, who joyfully availed themselves of this pretext for\r\nidleness, and were hurried along with the tide of distracting frenzy.\r\nBut as these brotherhoods gained in repute, and were welcomed by the\r\npeople, with veneration and enthusiasm, many nobles and ecclesiastics\r\nranged themselves under their standard; and their bands were not\r\nunfrequently augmented by children, honourable women and nuns; so\r\npowerfully were minds of the most opposite temperaments enslaved\r\nby this infatuation[115]. They marched through the cities, in well\r\norganized processions, with leaders and singers; their heads covered as\r\nfar as the eyes; their look fixed on the ground, accompanied by every\r\ntoken of the deepest contrition and mourning. They were robed in sombre\r\ngarments, with red crosses on the breast, back, and cap, and bore\r\ntriple scourges, tied in three or four knots, in which points of iron\r\nwere fixed[116]. Tapers and magnificent banners of velvet and cloth of\r\ngold, were carried before them; wherever they made their appearance,\r\nthey were welcomed by the ringing of the bells; and the people flocked\r\nfrom all quarters, to listen to their hymns and to witness their\r\npenance, with devotion and tears.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1349, two hundred Flagellants first entered Strasburg,\r\nwhere they were received with great joy, and hospitably lodged by the\r\ncitizens. Above a thousand joined the brotherhood, which now assumed\r\nthe appearance of a wandering tribe, and separated into two bodies, for\r\nthe purpose of journeying to the north and to the south. For more than\r\nhalf a year, new parties arrived weekly; and, on each arrival, adults\r\nand children left their families to accompany them; till, at length,\r\ntheir sanctity was questioned, and the doors of houses and churches\r\nwere closed against them[117]. At Spires, two hundred boys, of twelve\r\nyears of age and under, constituted themselves into a Brotherhood of\r\nthe Cross, in imitation of the children, who, about a hundred years\r\nbefore, had united, at the instigation of some fanatic monks, for the\r\npurpose of recovering the Holy Sepulchre. All the inhabitants of this\r\ntown were carried away by the illusion; they conducted the strangers to\r\ntheir houses with songs of thanksgiving, to regale them for the night.\r\nThe women embroidered banners for them, and all were anxious to augment\r\ntheir pomp; and at every succeeding pilgrimage, their influence and\r\nreputation increased[118].\r\n\r\nIt was not merely some individual parts of the country that fostered\r\nthem: all Germany, Hungary, Poland, Bohemia, Silesia, and Flanders,\r\ndid homage to the mania; and they at length became as formidable\r\nto the secular, as they were to the ecclesiastical power. The\r\ninfluence of this fanaticism was great and threatening; resembling\r\nthe excitement which called all the inhabitants of Europe into the\r\ndeserts of Syria and Palestine, about two hundred and fifty years\r\nbefore. The appearance, in itself, was not novel. As far back as the\r\n11th century, many believers, in Asia and Southern Europe, afflicted\r\nthemselves with the punishment of flagellation. Dominicus Loricatus,\r\na monk of St. Croce d’Avellano, is mentioned as the master and model\r\nof this species of mortification of the flesh; which, according to\r\nthe primitive notions of the Asiatic Anchorites, was deemed eminently\r\nChristian. The author of the solemn processions of the Flagellants, is\r\nsaid to have been St. Anthony; for even in his time (1231), this kind\r\nof penance was so much in vogue, that it is recorded as an eventful\r\ncircumstance in the history of the world. In 1260, the Flagellants\r\nappeared in Italy as _Devoti_. “When the land was polluted by vices\r\nand crimes[119], an unexampled spirit of remorse suddenly seized the\r\nminds of the Italians. The fear of Christ fell upon all: noble and\r\nignoble, old and young, and even children of five years of age, marched\r\nthrough the streets with no covering but a scarf round the waist. They\r\neach carried a scourge of leathern thongs, which they applied to their\r\nlimbs, amid sighs and tears, with such violence, that the blood flowed\r\nfrom the wounds. Not only during the day, but even by night, and in the\r\nseverest winter, they traversed the cities with burning torches and\r\nbanners, in thousands and tens of thousands, headed by their priests,\r\nand prostrated themselves before the altars. They proceeded in the same\r\nmanner in the villages: and the woods and mountains resounded with the\r\nvoices of those whose cries were raised to God. The melancholy chaunt\r\nof the penitent alone was heard. Enemies were reconciled; men and\r\nwomen vied with each other in splendid works of charity, as if they\r\ndreaded, that Divine Omnipotence would pronounce on them the doom of\r\nannihilation.”\r\n\r\nThe pilgrimages of the Flagellants extended throughout all the\r\nprovinces of Southern Germany, as far as Saxony, Bohemia and\r\nPoland, and even further; but at length, the priests resisted this\r\ndangerous fanaticism, without being able to extirpate the illusion,\r\nwhich was advantageous to the hierarchy, as long as it submitted to\r\nits sway. Regnier, a hermit of Perugia, is recorded as a fanatic\r\npreacher of penitence, with whom the extravagance originated[120].\r\nIn the year 1296, there was a great procession of the Flagellants in\r\nStrasburg[121]; and in 1334, fourteen years before the great mortality,\r\nthe sermon of Venturinus, a Dominican friar, of Bergamo, induced\r\nabove 10,000 persons to undertake a new pilgrimage. They scourged\r\nthemselves in the churches, and were entertained in the market-places,\r\nat the public expense. At Rome, Venturinus was derided, and banished\r\nby the Pope to the mountains of Ricondona. He patiently endured\r\nall—went to the Holy Land, and died at Smyrna, 1346[122]. Hence we\r\nsee that this fanaticism was a mania of the middle ages, which, in\r\nthe year 1349, on so fearful an occasion, and while still so fresh in\r\nremembrance, needed no new founder; of whom, indeed, all the records\r\nare silent. It probably arose in many places at the same time; for\r\nthe terror of death, which pervaded all nations and suddenly set such\r\npowerful impulses in motion, might easily conjure up the fanaticism of\r\nexaggerated and overpowering repentance.\r\n\r\nThe manner and proceedings of the Flagellants of the 13th and 14th\r\ncenturies, exactly resemble each other. But, if during the Black\r\nPlague, simple credulity came to their aid, which seized, as a\r\nconsolation, the grossest delusion of religious enthusiasm, yet it is\r\nevident that the leaders must have been intimately united, and have\r\nexercised the power of a secret association. Besides, the rude band\r\nwas generally under the control of men of learning, some of whom at\r\nleast, certainly had other objects in view, independent of those which\r\nostensibly appeared. Whoever was desirous of joining the brotherhood,\r\nwas bound to remain in it thirty-four days, and to have four pence per\r\nday at his own disposal, so that he might not be burthensome to any\r\none; if married, he was obliged to have the sanction of his wife, and\r\ngive the assurance that he was reconciled to all men. The Brothers\r\nof the Cross, were not permitted to seek for free quarters, or even\r\nto enter a house without having been invited; they were forbidden to\r\nconverse with females; and if they transgressed these rules, or acted\r\nwithout discretion, they were obliged to confess to the Superior, who\r\nsentenced them to several lashes of the scourge, by way of penance.\r\nEcclesiastics had not, as such, any pre-eminence among them; according\r\nto their original law, which, however, was often transgressed, they\r\ncould not become Masters, or take part in the _Secret Councils_.\r\nPenance was performed twice every day: in the morning and evening, they\r\nwent abroad in pairs, singing psalms, amid the ringing of the bells;\r\nand when they arrived at the place of flagellation, they stripped the\r\nupper part of their bodies and put off their shoes, keeping on only a\r\nlinen dress, reaching from the waist to the ancles. They then lay down\r\nin a large circle, in different positions, according to the nature of\r\ntheir crime: the adulterer with his face to the ground; the perjurer\r\non one side, holding up three of his fingers, &c., and were then\r\ncastigated, some more and some less, by the Master, who ordered them to\r\nrise in the words of a prescribed form[123]. Upon this, they scourged\r\nthemselves, amid the singing of psalms and loud supplications for\r\nthe averting of the plague, with genuflexions, and other ceremonies,\r\nof which contemporary writers give various accounts; and at the same\r\ntime constantly boasted of their penance, that the blood of their\r\nwounds was mingled with that of the Saviour[124]. One of them, in\r\nconclusion, stood up to read a letter, which it was pretended an angel\r\nhad brought from heaven, to St. Peter’s church, at Jerusalem, stating\r\nthat Christ, who was sore displeased at the sins of man, had granted,\r\nat the intercession of the Holy Virgin and of the angels, that all who\r\nshould wander about for thirty-four days and scourge themselves, should\r\nbe partakers of the Divine grace[125]. This scene caused as great a\r\ncommotion among the believers as the finding of the holy spear once did\r\nat Antioch; and if any among the clergy inquired who had sealed the\r\nletter? he was boldly answered, the same who had sealed the Gospel!\r\n\r\nAll this had so powerful an effect, that the church was in considerable\r\ndanger; for the Flagellants gained more credit than the priests, from\r\nwhom they so entirely withdrew themselves, that they even absolved\r\neach other. Besides, they everywhere took possession of the churches,\r\nand their new songs, which went from mouth to mouth, operated strongly\r\non the minds of the people. Great enthusiasm and originally pious\r\nfeelings, are clearly distinguishable in these hymns, and especially in\r\nthe chief psalm of the Cross-bearers, which is still extant, and which\r\nwas sung all over Germany, in different dialects, and is probably of\r\na more ancient date[126]. Degeneracy, however, soon crept in; crimes\r\nwere everywhere committed; and there was no energetic man capable of\r\ndirecting the individual excitement to purer objects, even had an\r\neffectual resistance to the tottering church been at that early period\r\nseasonable, and had it been possible to restrain the fanaticism.\r\nThe Flagellants sometimes undertook to make trial of their power of\r\nworking miracles; as in Strasburg, where they attempted, in their own\r\ncircle, to resuscitate a dead child: they however failed, and their\r\nunskilfulness did them much harm, though they succeeded here and there\r\nin maintaining some confidence in their holy calling, by pretending to\r\nhave the power of casting out evil spirits[127].\r\n\r\nThe Brotherhood of the Cross announced that the pilgrimage of the\r\nFlagellants was to continue for a space of thirty-four years; and many\r\nof the Masters had, doubtless, determined to form a lasting league\r\nagainst the church; but they had gone too far. So early as the first\r\nyear of their establishment, the general indignation set bounds to\r\ntheir intrigues; so that the strict measures adopted by the Emperor\r\nCharles IV., and Pope Clement[128], who, throughout the whole of this\r\nfearful period, manifested prudence and noble-mindedness, and conducted\r\nhimself in a manner every way worthy of his high station, were easily\r\nput into execution[129].\r\n\r\nThe Sorbonne, at Paris, and the Emperor Charles, had already applied\r\nto the Holy See, for assistance against these formidable and heretical\r\nexcesses, which had well nigh destroyed the influence of the clergy in\r\nevery place; when a hundred of the Brotherhood of the Cross arrived\r\nat Avignon from Basle, and desired admission. The Pope, regardless\r\nof the intercession of several cardinals, interdicted their public\r\npenance, which he had not authorized; and, on pain of excommunication,\r\nprohibited throughout Christendom the continuance of these\r\npilgrimages[130]. Philip VI., supported by the condemnatory judgment\r\nof the Sorbonne, forbad their reception in France[131]. Manfred, King\r\nof Sicily, at the same time threatened them with punishment by death:\r\nand in the East, they were withstood by several bishops, among whom was\r\nJanussius, of Gnesen[132], and Preczlaw, of Breslaw, who condemned to\r\ndeath one of their Masters, formerly a deacon; and, in conformity with\r\nthe barbarity of the times, had him publicly burnt[133]. In Westphalia,\r\nwhere so shortly before they had venerated the Brothers of the Cross,\r\nthey now persecuted them with relentless severity[134]; and in the\r\nMark, as well as in all the other countries of Germany, they pursued\r\nthem, as if they had been the authors of every misfortune[135].\r\n\r\nThe processions of the Brotherhood of the Cross undoubtedly promoted\r\nthe spreading of the plague; and it is evident, that the gloomy\r\nfanaticism which gave rise to them, would infuse a new poison into the\r\nalready desponding minds of the people.\r\n\r\nStill, however, all this was within the bounds of barbarous enthusiasm;\r\nbut horrible were the persecutions of the Jews, which were committed\r\nin most countries, with even greater exasperation than in the 12th\r\ncentury, during the first Crusades. In every destructive pestilence,\r\nthe common people at first attribute the mortality to poison. No\r\ninstruction avails; the supposed testimony of their eyesight, is to\r\nthem a proof, and they authoritatively demand the victims of their\r\nrage. On whom then was it so likely to fall, as on the Jews, the\r\nusurers and the strangers who lived at enmity with the Christians? They\r\nwere everywhere suspected of having poisoned the wells or infected the\r\nair[136]. They alone were considered as having brought this fearful\r\nmortality upon the Christians[137]. They were, in consequence, pursued\r\nwith merciless cruelty; and either indiscriminately given up to the\r\nfury of the populace, or sentenced by sanguinary tribunals, which,\r\nwith all the forms of law, ordered them to be burnt alive. In times\r\nlike these, much is indeed said of guilt and innocence; but hatred and\r\nrevenge bear down all discrimination, and the smallest probability,\r\nmagnifies suspicion into certainty. These bloody scenes, which\r\ndisgraced Europe in the 14th century, are a counterpart to a similar\r\nmania of the age, which was manifested in the persecutions of witches\r\nand sorcerers; and, like these they prove, that enthusiasm, associated\r\nwith hatred, and leagued with the baser passions, may work more\r\npowerfully upon whole nations, than religion and legal order; nay, that\r\nit even knows how to profit by the authority of both, in order the more\r\nsurely to satiate with blood, the sword of long suppressed revenge.\r\n\r\nThe persecution of the Jews commenced in September and October,\r\n1348[138], at Chillon, on the Lake of Geneva, where the first criminal\r\nproceedings were instituted against them, after they had long before\r\nbeen accused by the people of poisoning the wells; similar scenes\r\nfollowed in Bern and Freyburg, in January, 1349. Under the influence of\r\nexcruciating suffering, the tortured Jews confessed themselves guilty\r\nof the crime imputed to them; and it being affirmed that poison had in\r\nfact been found in a well at Zoffingen, this was deemed a sufficient\r\nproof to convince the world; and the persecution of the abhorred\r\nculprits, thus appeared justifiable. Now, though we can take as little\r\nexception at these proceedings, as at the multifarious confessions of\r\nwitches, because the interrogatories of the fanatical and sanguinary\r\ntribunals, were so complicated, that by means of the rack, the required\r\nanswer must inevitably be obtained; and it is besides conformable\r\nto human nature, that crimes which are in every body’s mouth, may,\r\nin the end, be actually committed by some, either from wantonness,\r\nrevenge, or desperate exasperation: yet crimes and accusations are,\r\nunder circumstances like these, merely the offspring of a revengeful,\r\nfrenzied spirit in the people; and the accusers, according to the\r\nfundamental principles of morality, which are the same in every age,\r\nare the more guilty transgressors.\r\n\r\nAlready in the autumn of 1348, a dreadful panic, caused by this\r\nsupposed empoisonment, seized all nations; in Germany especially, the\r\nsprings and wells were built over, that nobody might drink of them, or\r\nemploy their contents for culinary purposes: and for a long time, the\r\ninhabitants of numerous towns and villages, used only river and rain\r\nwater[139]. The city gates were also guarded with the greatest caution:\r\nonly confidential persons were admitted; and if medicine, or any other\r\narticle, which might be supposed to be poisonous, was found in the\r\npossession of a stranger,—and it was natural that some should have\r\nthese things by them for their private use,—they were forced to swallow\r\na portion of it[140]. By this trying state of privation, distrust and\r\nsuspicion, the hatred against the supposed poisoners became greatly\r\nincreased, and often broke out in popular commotions, which only served\r\nstill further to infuriate the wildest passions. The noble and the\r\nmean, fearlessly bound themselves by an oath, to extirpate the Jews\r\nby fire and sword, and to snatch them from their protectors, of whom\r\nthe number was so small, that throughout all Germany, but few places\r\ncan be mentioned where these unfortunate people were not regarded as\r\noutlaws and martyred and burnt[141]. Solemn summonses were issued from\r\nBern to the towns of Basle, Freyburg in the Breisgau, and Strasburg, to\r\npursue the Jews as poisoners. The Burgomasters and Senators, indeed,\r\nopposed this requisition; but in Basle the populace obliged them to\r\nbind themselves by an oath, to burn the Jews, and to forbid persons of\r\nthat community from entering their city, for the space of two hundred\r\nyears. Upon this, all the Jews in Basle, whose number could not have\r\nbeen inconsiderable, were inclosed in a wooden building, constructed\r\nfor the purpose, and burnt together with it, upon the mere outcry of\r\nthe people, without sentence or trial, which indeed would have availed\r\nthem nothing. Soon after, the same thing took place at Freyburg. A\r\nregular Diet was held at Bennefeld, in Alsace, where the bishops, lords\r\nand barons, as also deputies of the counties and towns, consulted how\r\nthey should proceed with regard to the Jews; and when the deputies of\r\nStrasburg —not indeed the bishop of this town, who proved himself a\r\nviolent fanatic—spoke in favour of the persecuted, as nothing criminal\r\nwas substantiated against them; a great outcry was raised, and it was\r\nvehemently asked, why, if so, they had covered their wells and removed\r\ntheir buckets? A sanguinary decree was resolved upon, of which the\r\npopulace, who obeyed the call of the nobles and superior clergy, became\r\nbut the too willing executioners[142]. Wherever the Jews were not\r\nburnt, they were at least banished; and so being compelled to wander\r\nabout, they fell into the hands of the country people, who without\r\nhumanity, and regardless of all laws, persecuted them with fire and\r\nsword. At Spires, the Jews, driven to despair, assembled in their own\r\nhabitations, which they set on fire, and thus consumed themselves\r\nwith their families. The few that remained were forced to submit to\r\nbaptism; while the dead bodies of the murdered, which lay about the\r\nstreets, were put into empty wine casks, and rolled into the Rhine,\r\nlest they should infect the air. The mob was forbidden to enter the\r\nruins of the habitations that were burnt in the Jewish quarter; for the\r\nsenate itself caused search to be made for the treasure, which is said\r\nto have been very considerable. At Strasburg, two thousand Jews were\r\nburnt alive in their own burial ground, where a large scaffold had been\r\nerected: a few who promised to embrace Christianity, were spared, and\r\ntheir children taken from the pile. The youth and beauty of several\r\nfemales also excited some commiseration; and they were snatched from\r\ndeath against their will: many, however, who forcibly made their escape\r\nfrom the flames, were murdered in the streets.\r\n\r\nThe senate ordered all pledges and bonds to be returned to the debtors,\r\nand divided the money among the work-people[143]. Many, however,\r\nrefused to accept the base price of blood, and, indignant at the\r\nscenes of blood-thirsty avarice, which made the infuriated multitude\r\nforget[144] that the plague was raging around them, presented it to\r\nmonasteries, in conformity with the advice of their confessors. In all\r\nthe countries on the Rhine, these cruelties continued to be perpetrated\r\nduring the succeeding months; and after quiet was in some degree\r\nrestored, the people thought to render an acceptable service to God, by\r\ntaking the bricks of the destroyed dwellings, and the tombstones of the\r\nJews, to repair churches and to erect belfries[145].\r\n\r\nIn Mayence alone, 12,000 Jews are said to have been put to a cruel\r\ndeath. The Flagellants entered that place in August; the Jews, on\r\nthis occasion, fell out with the Christians, and killed several; but\r\nwhen they saw their inability to withstand the increasing superiority\r\nof their enemies, and that nothing could save them from destruction,\r\nthey consumed themselves and their families, by setting fire to their\r\ndwellings. Thus also, in other places, the entry of the Flagellants\r\ngave rise to scenes of slaughter; and as thirst for blood was\r\neverywhere combined with an unbridled spirit of proselytism, a fanatic\r\nzeal arose among the Jews, to perish as martyrs to their ancient\r\nreligion. And how was it possible, that they could from the heart\r\nembrace Christianity, when its precepts were never more outrageously\r\nviolated? At Eslingen, the whole Jewish community burned themselves\r\nin their synagogue[146]; and mothers were often seen throwing their\r\nchildren on the pile, to prevent their being baptized, and then\r\nprecipitating themselves into the flames[147]. In short, whatever\r\ndeeds, fanaticism, revenge, avarice and desperation, in fearful\r\ncombination, could instigate mankind to perform,—and where in such a\r\ncase is the limit?—were executed in the year 1349, throughout Germany,\r\nItaly and France, with impunity, and in the eyes of all the world.\r\nIt seemed as if the plague gave rise to scandalous acts and frantic\r\ntumults, not to mourning and grief: and the greater part of those who,\r\nby their education and rank, were called upon to raise the voice of\r\nreason, themselves led on the savage mob to murder and to plunder.\r\nAlmost all the Jews who saved their lives by baptism, were afterwards\r\nburnt at different times; for they continued to be accused of poisoning\r\nthe water and the air. Christians also, whom philanthropy or gain had\r\ninduced to offer them protection, were put on the rack and executed\r\nwith them[148]. Many Jews who had embraced Christianity, repented of\r\ntheir apostacy,—and, returning to their former faith, sealed it with\r\ntheir death[149].\r\n\r\nThe humanity and prudence of Clement VI., must, on this occasion,\r\nalso be mentioned to his honour; but even the highest ecclesiastical\r\npower was insufficient to restrain the unbridled fury of the people.\r\nHe not only protected the Jews at Avignon, as far as lay in his power,\r\nbut also issued two bulls, in which he declared them innocent; and\r\nadmonished all Christians, though without success, to cease from\r\nsuch groundless persecutions[150]. The Emperor Charles IV. was also\r\nfavourable to them, and sought to avert their destruction, wherever\r\nhe could; but he dared not draw the sword of justice, and even found\r\nhimself obliged to yield to the selfishness of the Bohemian nobles,\r\nwho were unwilling to forego so favourable an opportunity of releasing\r\nthemselves from their Jewish creditors, under favour of an imperial\r\nmandate[151]. Duke Albert of Austria burned and pillaged those of his\r\ncities, which had persecuted the Jews,—a vain and inhuman proceeding,\r\nwhich, moreover, is not exempt from the suspicion of covetousness; yet\r\nhe was unable, in his own fortress of Kyberg, to protect some hundreds\r\nof Jews, who had been received there, from being barbarously burnt by\r\nthe inhabitants[152]. Several other princes and counts, among whom\r\nwas Ruprecht von der Pfalz, took the Jews under their protection on\r\nthe payment of large sums: in consequence of which they were called\r\n“Jew-masters,” and were in danger of being attacked by the populace\r\nand by their powerful neighbours[153]. These persecuted and ill-used\r\npeople, except indeed where humane individuals took compassion on them\r\nat their own peril, or when they could command riches to purchase\r\nprotection, had no place of refuge left but the distant country\r\nof Lithuania, where Boleslav V., Duke of Poland (1227–1279), had\r\nbefore granted them liberty of conscience; and King Casimir the Great\r\n(1333–1370), yielding to the entreaties of Esther, a favourite Jewess,\r\nreceived them, and granted them further protection[154]: on which\r\naccount, that country is still inhabited by a great number of Jews,\r\nwho by their secluded habits, have, more than any people in Europe,\r\nretained the manners of the middle ages.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the fearful accusations against the Jews; it was\r\nreported in all Europe, that they were in connexion with secret\r\nsuperiors in Toledo, to whose decrees they were subject, and from\r\nwhom they had received commands respecting the coining of base money,\r\npoisoning, the murder of Christian children, &c.[155]; that they\r\nreceived the poison by sea from remote parts, and also prepared it\r\nthemselves from spiders, owls and other venomous animals; but, in\r\norder that their secret might not be discovered, that it was known\r\nonly to the Rabbis and rich men[156]. Apparently there were but few\r\nwho did not consider this extravagant accusation well founded; indeed,\r\nin many writings of the 14th century, we find great acrimony with\r\nregard to the suspected poison mixers, which plainly demonstrates the\r\nprejudice existing against them. Unhappily, after the confessions of\r\nthe first victims in Switzerland, the rack extorted similar ones in\r\nvarious places. Some even acknowledged having received poisonous powder\r\nin bags, and injunctions from Toledo, by secret messengers. Bags of\r\nthis description were also often found in wells, though it was not\r\nunfrequently discovered that the Christians themselves had thrown them\r\nin; probably to give occasion to murder and pillage; similar instances\r\nof which may be found in the persecutions of the witches[157].\r\n\r\nThis picture needs no additions. A lively image of the Black Plague,\r\nand of the moral evil which followed in its train, will vividly\r\nrepresent itself to him who is acquainted with nature and the\r\nconstitution of society. Almost the only credible accounts of the\r\nmanner of living, and of the ruin which occurred in private life,\r\nduring this pestilence, are from Italy; and these may enable us to form\r\na just estimate of the general state of families in Europe, taking into\r\nconsideration what is peculiar in the manners of each country.\r\n\r\n“When the evil had become universal,” (speaking of Florence,) “the\r\nhearts of all the inhabitants were closed to feelings of humanity.\r\nThey fled from the sick and all that belonged to them, hoping by these\r\nmeans to save themselves. Others shut themselves up in their houses,\r\nwith their wives, their children and households, living on the most\r\ncostly food, but carefully avoiding all excess. None were allowed\r\naccess to them; no intelligence of death or sickness was permitted\r\nto reach their ears; and they spent their time in singing and music,\r\nand other pastimes. Others, on the contrary, considered eating and\r\ndrinking to excess, amusements of all descriptions, the indulgence of\r\nevery gratification, and an indifference to what was passing around\r\nthem, as the best medicine, and acted accordingly. They wandered day\r\nand night, from one tavern to another, and feasted without moderation\r\nor bounds. In this way they endeavoured to avoid all contact with the\r\nsick, and abandoned their houses and property to chance, like men whose\r\ndeath-knell had already tolled.\r\n\r\n“Amid this general lamentation and woe, the influence and authority\r\nof every law, human and divine, vanished. Most of those who were in\r\noffice, had been carried off by the plague, or lay sick, or had lost\r\nso many members of their families, that they were unable to attend\r\nto their duties; so that thenceforth every one acted as he thought\r\nproper. Others, in their mode of living, chose a middle course.\r\nThey ate and drank what they pleased, and walked abroad, carrying\r\nodoriferous flowers, herbs or spices, which they smelt to from time\r\nto time, in order to invigorate the brain, and to avert the baneful\r\ninfluence of the air, infected by the sick, and by the innumerable\r\ncorpses of those who had died of the plague. Others carried their\r\nprecaution still further, and thought the surest way to escape death\r\nwas by flight. They therefore left the city; women as well as men\r\nabandoning their dwellings and their relations, and retiring into the\r\ncountry. But of these also, many were carried off, most of them alone\r\nand deserted by all the world, themselves having previously set the\r\nexample. Thus it was, that one citizen fled from another—a neighbour\r\nfrom his neighbours—a relation from his relations; and in the end, so\r\ncompletely had terror extinguished every kindlier feeling, that the\r\nbrother forsook the brother—the sister the sister—the wife her husband;\r\nand at last, even the parent his own offspring, and abandoned them,\r\nunvisited and unsoothed, to their fate. Those, therefore, that stood\r\nin need of assistance fell a prey to greedy attendants; who for an\r\nexorbitant recompense, merely handed the sick their food and medicine,\r\nremained with them in their last moments, and then not unfrequently,\r\nbecame themselves victims to their avarice and lived not to enjoy\r\ntheir extorted gain. Propriety and decorum were extinguished among\r\nthe helpless sick. Females of rank seemed to forget their natural\r\nbashfulness, and committed the care of their persons, indiscriminately,\r\nto men and women of the lowest order. No longer were women, relatives\r\nor friends, found in the house of mourning, to share the grief of\r\nthe survivors—no longer was the corpse accompanied to the grave by\r\nneighbours and a numerous train of priests, carrying wax tapers and\r\nsinging psalms, nor was it borne along by other citizens of equal rank.\r\nMany breathed their last without a friend to sooth their dying pillow;\r\nand few indeed were they who departed amid the lamentations and tears\r\nof their friends and kindred. Instead of sorrow and mourning, appeared\r\nindifference, frivolity and mirth; this being considered, especially\r\nby the females, as conducive to health. Seldom was the body followed\r\nby even ten or twelve attendants; and instead of the usual bearers and\r\nsextons, mercenaries of the lowest of the populace undertook the office\r\nfor the sake of gain; and accompanied by only a few priests, and often\r\nwithout a single taper, it was borne to the very nearest church, and\r\nlowered into the first grave that was not already too full to receive\r\nit. Among the middling classes, and especially among the poor, the\r\nmisery was still greater. Poverty or negligence induced most of these\r\nto remain in their dwellings, or in the immediate neighbourhood; and\r\nthus they fell by thousands: and many ended their lives in the streets,\r\nby day and by night. The stench of putrefying corpses was often the\r\nfirst indication to their neighbours that more deaths had occurred. The\r\nsurvivors, to preserve themselves from infection, generally had the\r\nbodies taken out of the houses, and laid before the doors; where the\r\nearly morn found them in heaps, exposed to the affrighted gaze of the\r\npassing stranger. It was no longer possible to have a bier for every\r\ncorpse,—three or four were generally laid together—husband and wife,\r\nfather and mother, with two or three children, were frequently borne\r\nto the grave on the same bier; and it often happened that two priests\r\nwould accompany a coffin, bearing the cross before it, and be joined on\r\nthe way by several other funerals; so that instead of one, there were\r\nfive or six bodies for interment.”\r\n\r\nThus far Boccacio. On the conduct of the priests, another contemporary\r\nobserves[158]: “In large and small towns, they had withdrawn themselves\r\nthrough fear, leaving the performance of ecclesiastical duties to the\r\nfew who were found courageous and faithful enough to undertake them.”\r\nBut we ought not on that account to throw more blame on them than on\r\nothers; for we find proofs of the same timidity and heartlessness in\r\nevery class. During the prevalence of the Black Plague, the charitable\r\norders conducted themselves admirably, and did as much good as can be\r\ndone by individual bodies, in times of great misery and destruction;\r\nwhen compassion, courage, and the nobler feelings, are found but in the\r\nfew, while cowardice, selfishness and ill-will, with the baser passions\r\nin their train, assert the supremacy. In place of virtue, which had\r\nbeen driven from the earth, wickedness everywhere reared her rebellious\r\nstandard, and succeeding generations were consigned to the dominion of\r\nher baleful tyranny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                              PHYSICIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we now turn to the medical talent which encountered the “_Great\r\nMortality_,” the middle ages must stand excused, since even the\r\nmoderns are of opinion that the art of medicine is not able to cope\r\nwith the Oriental plague, and can afford deliverance from it only\r\nunder particularly favourable circumstances[159]. We must bear in mind\r\nalso, that human science and art appear particularly weak in great\r\npestilences, because they have to contend with the powers of nature, of\r\nwhich they have no knowledge; and which, if they had been, or could be\r\ncomprehended in their collective effects, would remain uncontrollable\r\nby them, principally on account of the disordered condition of human\r\nsociety. Moreover, every new plague has its peculiarities, which are\r\nthe less easily discovered on first view, because, during its ravages,\r\nfear and consternation humble the proud spirit.\r\n\r\nThe physicians of the 14th century, during the Black Death, did what\r\nhuman intellect could do in the actual condition of the healing art;\r\nand their knowledge of the disease was by no means despicable. They,\r\nlike the rest of mankind, have indulged in prejudices, and defended\r\nthem, perhaps, with too much obstinacy; some of these, however, were\r\nfounded on the mode of thinking of the age, and passed current in those\r\ndays, as established truths: others continue to exist to the present\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nTheir successors in the 19th century, ought not therefore to vaunt\r\ntoo highly the pre-eminence of their knowledge, for they too will be\r\nsubjected to the severe judgment of posterity—they too, will, with\r\nreason, be accused of human weakness and want of foresight.\r\n\r\nThe medical faculty of Paris, the most celebrated of the 14th century,\r\nwere commissioned to deliver their opinion on the causes of the Black\r\nPlague, and to furnish some appropriate regulations with regard to\r\nliving, during its prevalence. This document is sufficiently remarkable\r\nto find a place here.\r\n\r\n“We, the Members of the College of Physicians of Paris, have, after\r\nmature consideration and consultation on the present mortality,\r\ncollected the advice of our old masters in the art, and intend to make\r\nknown the causes of this pestilence, more clearly than could be done\r\naccording to the rules and principles of astrology and natural science;\r\nwe, therefore, declare as follows:—\r\n\r\n“It is known that in India, and the vicinity of the Great Sea, the\r\nconstellations which combated the rays of the sun, and the warmth of\r\nthe heavenly fire, exerted their power especially against that sea, and\r\nstruggled violently with its waters. (Hence, vapours often originate\r\nwhich envelope the sun, and convert his light into darkness.) These\r\nvapours alternately rose and fell for twenty-eight days; but at last,\r\nsun and fire acted so powerfully upon the sea, that they attracted a\r\ngreat portion of it to themselves, and the waters of the ocean arose\r\nin the form of vapour; thereby the waters were, in some parts, so\r\ncorrupted, that the fish which they contained, died. These corrupted\r\nwaters, however, the heat of the sun could not consume, neither could\r\nother wholesome water, hail or snow, and dew, originate therefrom. On\r\nthe contrary, this vapour spread itself through the air in many places\r\non the earth, and enveloped them in fog.\r\n\r\n“Such was the case all over Arabia, in a part of India; in Crete; in\r\nthe plains and valleys of Macedonia; in Hungary, Albania and Sicily.\r\nShould the same thing occur in Sardinia, not a man will be left alive;\r\nand the like will continue, so long as the sun remains in the sign\r\nof Leo, on all the islands and adjoining countries to which this\r\ncorrupted sea-wind extends, or has already extended from India. If the\r\ninhabitants of those parts do not employ and adhere to the following,\r\nor similar means and precepts, we announce to them inevitable\r\ndeath—except the grace of Christ preserve their lives.\r\n\r\n“We are of opinion, that the constellations, with the aid of Nature,\r\nstrive, by virtue of their divine might, to protect and heal the human\r\nrace; and to this end, in union with the rays of the sun, acting\r\nthrough the power of fire, endeavour to break through the mist.\r\nAccordingly, within the next ten days, and until the 17th of the\r\nensuing month of July, this mist will be converted into a stinking\r\ndeleterious rain, whereby the air will be much purified. Now, as soon\r\nas this rain shall announce itself, by thunder or hail, every one of\r\nyou should protect himself from the air; and, as well before as after\r\nthe rain, kindle a large fire of vine-wood, green laurel, or other\r\ngreen wood; wormwood and chamomile should also be burnt in great\r\nquantity in the market-places, in other densely inhabited localities,\r\nand in the houses. Until the earth is again completely dry, and for\r\nthree days afterwards, no one ought to go abroad in the fields. During\r\nthis time the diet should be simple, and people should be cautious\r\nin avoiding exposure in the cool of the evening, at night, and in\r\nthe morning. Poultry and water-fowl, young pork, old beef, and fat\r\nmeat, in general, should not be eaten; but on the contrary, meat of\r\na proper age, of a warm and dry, but on no account of a heating and\r\nexciting nature. Broth should be taken, seasoned with ground pepper,\r\nginger and cloves, especially by those who are accustomed to live\r\ntemperately, and are yet choice in their diet. Sleep in the day-time\r\nis detrimental; it should be taken at night until sunrise, or somewhat\r\nlonger. At breakfast, one should drink little; supper should be taken\r\nan hour before sunset, when more may be drunk than in the morning.\r\nClear light wine, mixed with a fifth or sixth part of water, should\r\nbe used as a beverage. Dried or fresh fruits, with wine, are not\r\ninjurious; but highly so without it. Beet-root and other vegetables,\r\nwhether eaten pickled or fresh, are hurtful; on the contrary, spicy\r\npot-herbs, as sage or rosemary, are wholesome. Cold, moist, watery\r\nfood is in general prejudicial. Going out at night, and even until\r\nthree o’clock in the morning, is dangerous, on account of the dew. Only\r\nsmall river fish should be used. Too much exercise is hurtful. The body\r\nshould be kept warmer than usual, and thus protected from moisture\r\nand cold. Rain-water must not be employed in cooking, and every one\r\nshould guard against exposure to wet weather. If it rain, a little fine\r\ntreacle should be taken after dinner. Fat people should not sit in the\r\nsunshine. Good clear wine should be selected and drunk often, but in\r\nsmall quantities, by day. Olive oil as an article of food, is fatal.\r\nEqually injurious are fasting and excessive abstemiousness, anxiety\r\nof mind, anger, and immoderate drinking. Young people, in autumn\r\nespecially, must abstain from all these things, if they do not wish to\r\nrun a risk of dying of dysentery. In order to keep the body properly\r\nopen, an enema, or some other simple means, should be employed, when\r\nnecessary. Bathing is injurious. Men must preserve chastity as they\r\nvalue their lives. Every one should impress this on his recollection,\r\nbut especially those who reside on the coast, or upon an island into\r\nwhich the noxious wind has penetrated.”[160]\r\n\r\nOn what occasion these strange precepts were delivered can no longer\r\nbe ascertained, even if it were an object to know it. It must be\r\nacknowledged, however, that they do not redound to the credit either\r\nof the faculty of Paris, or of the 14th century in general. This\r\nfamous faculty found themselves under the painful necessity of being\r\nwise at command, and of firing a point blank shot of erudition at an\r\nenemy who enveloped himself in a dark mist, of the nature of which\r\nthey had no conception. In concealing their ignorance by authoritative\r\nassertions, they suffered themselves, therefore, to be misled; and\r\nwhile endeavouring to appear to the world with eclat, only betrayed to\r\nthe intelligent their lamentable weakness. Now some might suppose, that\r\nin the condition of the sciences of the 14th century, no intelligent\r\nphysicians existed; but this is altogether at variance with the laws of\r\nhuman advancement, and is contradicted by history. The real knowledge\r\nof an age is shewn only in the archives of its literature. Here alone\r\nthe genius of truth speaks audibly:—here alone men of talent deposit\r\nthe results of their experience and reflection, without vanity or a\r\nselfish object. There is no ground for believing that, in the 14th\r\ncentury, men of this kind were publicly questioned regarding their\r\nviews; and it is, therefore, the more necessary that impartial history\r\nshould take up their cause and do justice to their merits.\r\n\r\nThe first notice on this subject is due to a very celebrated teacher\r\nin Perugia, Gentilis of Foligno, who, on the 18th of June, 1348,\r\nfell a sacrifice to the plague, in the faithful discharge of his\r\nduty[161]. Attached to Arabian doctrines, and to the universally\r\nrespected Galen, he, in common with all his contemporaries, believed\r\nin a putrid corruption of the blood in the lungs and in the heart,\r\nwhich was occasioned by the pestilential atmosphere, and was forthwith\r\ncommunicated to the whole body. He thought, therefore, that every thing\r\ndepended upon a sufficient purification of the air, by means of large\r\nblazing fires of odoriferous wood, in the vicinity of the healthy, as\r\nwell as of the sick, and also upon an appropriate manner of living;\r\nso that the putridity might not overpower the diseased. In conformity\r\nwith notions derived from the ancients, he depended upon bleeding\r\nand purging, at the commencement of the attack, for the purpose of\r\npurification; ordered the healthy to wash themselves frequently with\r\nvinegar or wine, to sprinkle their dwellings with vinegar, and to\r\nsmell often to camphor, or other volatile substances. Hereupon he\r\ngave, after the Arabian fashion, detailed rules, with an abundance of\r\ndifferent medicines, of whose healing powers wonderful things were\r\nbelieved. He laid little stress upon super-lunar influences, so far as\r\nrespected the malady itself; on which account, he did not enter into\r\nthe great controversies of the astrologers, but always kept in view,\r\nas an object of medical attention, the corruption of the blood in the\r\nlungs and heart. He believed in a progressive infection from country\r\nto country, according to the notions of the present day; and the\r\ncontagious power of the disease, even in the vicinity of those affected\r\nby plague, was, in his opinion, beyond all doubt[162]. On this point,\r\nintelligent contemporaries were all agreed; and in truth, it required\r\nno great genius to be convinced of so palpable a fact. Besides,\r\ncorrect notions of contagion have descended from remote antiquity,\r\nand were maintained unchanged in the 14th century[163]. So far back\r\nas the age of Plato, a knowledge of the contagious power of malignant\r\ninflammations of the eye, of which also no physician of the middle ages\r\nentertained a doubt[164], was general among the people[165]; yet, in\r\nmodern times, surgeons have filled volumes with partial controversies\r\non this subject. The whole language of antiquity has adapted itself to\r\nthe notions of the people, respecting the contagion of pestilential\r\ndiseases; and their terms were, beyond comparison, more expressive than\r\nthose in use among the moderns[166].\r\n\r\nArrangements for the protection of the healthy against contagious\r\ndiseases, the necessity of which is shewn from these notions, were\r\nregarded by the ancients as useful; and by many, whose circumstances\r\npermitted it, were carried into effect in their houses. Even a total\r\nseparation of the sick from the healthy, that indispensable means of\r\nprotection against infection by contact, was proposed by physicians\r\nof the 2nd century after Christ, in order to check the spreading of\r\nleprosy. But it was decidedly opposed, because, as it was alleged,\r\nthe healing art ought not to be guilty of such harshness[167]. This\r\nmildness of the ancients, in whose manner of thinking inhumanity was\r\nso often and so undisguisedly conspicuous, might excite surprise, if\r\nit were any thing more than apparent. The true ground of the neglect\r\nof public protection against pestilential diseases, lay in the general\r\nnotion and constitution of human society,—it lay in the disregard of\r\nhuman life, of which the great nations of antiquity have given proofs\r\nin every page of their history. Let it not be supposed that they wanted\r\nknowledge respecting the propagation of contagious diseases. On the\r\ncontrary, they were as well informed on this subject as the moderns;\r\nbut this was shewn where individual property, not where human life, on\r\nthe grand scale, was to be protected. Hence the ancients made a general\r\npractice of arresting the progress of murrains among cattle, by a\r\nseparation of the diseased from the healthy. Their herds alone enjoyed\r\nthat protection which they held it impracticable to extend to human\r\nsociety, because they had no wish to do so[168]. That the governments\r\nin the 14th century, were not yet so far advanced, as to put into\r\npractice general regulations for checking the plague, needs no especial\r\nproof. Physicians could, therefore, only advise public purifications of\r\nthe air by means of large fires, as had often been practised in ancient\r\ntimes; and they were obliged to leave it to individual families,\r\neither to seek safety in flight, or to shut themselves up in their\r\ndwellings[169], a method which answers in common plagues, but which\r\nhere afforded no complete security, because such was the fury of the\r\ndisease when it was at its height, that the atmosphere of whole cities\r\nwas penetrated by the infection.\r\n\r\nOf the astral influence which was considered to have originated the\r\n“_Great Mortality_,” physicians and learned men were as completely\r\nconvinced as of the fact of its reality. A grand conjunction of the\r\nthree superior planets, Saturn, Jupiter and Mars, in the sign of\r\nAquarius, which took place, according to Guy de Chauliac, on the 24th\r\nof March, 1345, was generally received as its principal cause. In\r\nfixing the day, this physician, who was deeply versed in astrology,\r\ndid not agree with others; whereupon there arose various disputations,\r\nof weight in that age, but of none in ours; people, however, agreed\r\nin this—that conjunctions of the planets infallibly prognosticated\r\ngreat events; great revolutions of kingdoms, new prophets, destructive\r\nplagues, and other occurrences which bring distress and horror on\r\nmankind. No medical author of the 14th and 15th centuries omits an\r\nopportunity of representing them as among the general prognostics\r\nof great plagues; nor can we, for our parts, regard the astrology\r\nof the middle ages, as a mere offspring of superstition. It has not\r\nonly, in common with all ideas which inspire and guide mankind, a\r\nhigh historical importance, entirely independent of its error or\r\ntruth—for the influence of both is equally powerful—but there are also\r\ncontained in it, as in alchymy, grand thoughts of antiquity, of which\r\nmodern natural philosophy is so little ashamed that she claims them as\r\nher property. Foremost among these, is the idea of the general life\r\nwhich diffuses itself throughout the whole universe, expressed by the\r\ngreatest Greek sages, and transmitted to the middle ages, through the\r\nnew Platonic natural philosophy. To this impression of an universal\r\norganism, the assumption of a reciprocal influence of terrestrial\r\nbodies could not be foreign[170], nor did this cease to correspond with\r\na higher view of nature, until astrologers overstepped the limits of\r\nhuman knowledge with frivolous and mystical calculations.\r\n\r\nGuy de Chauliac, considers the influence of the conjunction, which was\r\nheld to be all-potent, as the chief general cause of the Black Plague;\r\nand the diseased state of bodies, the corruption of the fluids,\r\ndebility, obstruction, and so forth, as the especial subordinate\r\ncauses[171]. By these, according to his opinion, the quality of\r\nthe air, and of the other elements, was so altered, that they set\r\npoisonous fluids in motion towards the inward parts of the body, in\r\nthe same manner as the magnet attracts iron; whence there arose in the\r\ncommencement fever and the spitting of blood; afterwards, however, a\r\ndeposition in the form of glandular swellings and inflammatory boils.\r\nHerein the notion of an epidemic constitution was set forth clearly,\r\nand conformably to the spirit of the age. Of contagion, Guy de Chauliac\r\nwas completely convinced. He sought to protect himself against it by\r\nthe usual means[172]; and it was probably he who advised Pope Clement\r\nVI. to shut himself up while the plague lasted. The preservation of\r\nthis pope’s life, however, was most beneficial to the city of Avignon,\r\nfor he loaded the poor with judicious acts of kindness, took care to\r\nhave proper attendants provided, and paid physicians himself to afford\r\nassistance wherever human aid could avail—an advantage which, perhaps,\r\nno other city enjoyed[173]. Nor was the treatment of plague-patients\r\nin Avignon by any means objectionable; for, after the usual depletions\r\nby bleeding and aperients, where circumstances required them, they\r\nendeavoured to bring the buboes to suppuration; they made incisions\r\ninto the inflammatory boils, or burned them with a red-hot iron, a\r\npractice which at all times proves salutary, and in the Black Plague\r\nsaved many lives. In this city, the Jews, who lived in a state of the\r\ngreatest filth, were most severely visited, as also the Spaniards, whom\r\nChalin accuses of great intemperance[174].\r\n\r\nStill more distinct notions on the causes of the plague were stated\r\nto his contemporaries in the 14th century, by Galeazzo di Santa\r\nSofia, a learned man, a native of Padua, who likewise treated\r\nplague-patients at Vienna[175], though in what year is undetermined.\r\nHe distinguishes carefully _pestilence_ from _epidemy_ and _endemy_.\r\nThe common notion of the two first accords exactly with that of an\r\nepidemic constitution, for both consist, according to him, in an\r\nunknown change or corruption of the air; with this difference, that\r\n_pestilence_ calls forth diseases of different kinds; _epidemy_, on\r\nthe contrary, always the same disease. As an example of an _epidemy_,\r\nhe adduces a cough (influenza) which was observed in all climates\r\nat the same time, without perceptible cause; but he recognised the\r\napproach of a _pestilence_, independently of unusual natural phenomena,\r\nby the more frequent occurrence of various kinds of fever, to which\r\nthe modern physicians would assign a nervous and putrid character.\r\nThe _endemy_ originates, according to him, only in local telluric\r\nchanges—in deleterious influences which develop themselves in the\r\nearth and in the water, without a corruption of the air. These notions\r\nwere variously jumbled together in his time, like every thing which\r\nhuman understanding separates by too fine a line of limitation.\r\nThe estimation of cosmical influences, however, in the _epidemy_\r\nand _pestilence_, is well worthy of commendation; and Santa Sofia,\r\nin this respect, not only agrees with the most intelligent persons\r\nof the 14th and 15th centuries, but he has also promulgated an\r\nopinion which must, even now, serve as a foundation for our scarcely\r\ncommenced investigations into cosmical influences[176]. _Pestilence_\r\nand _epidemy_, consist not in alterations of the four primary\r\nqualities[177], but in a corruption of the air, powerful, though quite\r\nimmaterial, and not cognoscible by the senses:—(corruptio aëris non\r\nsubstantialis, sed qualitativa) in a disproportion of the imponderables\r\nin the atmosphere, as it would be expressed by the moderns[178]. The\r\ncauses of the _pestilence_ and _epidemy_ are, first of all, astral\r\ninfluences, especially on occasion of planetary conjunctions; then\r\nextensive putrefaction of animal and vegetable bodies, and terrestrial\r\ncorruptions (corruptio in terra); to which also, bad diet and want may\r\ncontribute. Santa Sofia considers the putrefaction of locusts, that had\r\nperished in the sea, and were again thrown up, combined with astral and\r\nterrestrial influences, as the cause of the pestilence in the eventful\r\nyear of the “_Great Mortality_.”\r\n\r\nAll the fevers which were called forth by the _pestilence_, are,\r\naccording to him, of the putrid kind; for they originate principally\r\nfrom putridity of the heart’s blood, which inevitably follows the\r\ninhalation of infected air. The Oriental Plague is, sometimes, but by\r\nno means always, occasioned by _pestilence_ (?), which imparts to it\r\na character (qualitas occulta) hostile to human nature. It originates\r\nfrequently from other causes, among which, this physician was aware\r\nthat contagion was to be reckoned; and it deserves to be remarked, that\r\nhe held epidemic small-pox and measles to be infallible forerunners of\r\nthe plague, as do the physicians and people of the East[179], at the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nIn the exposition of his therapeutical views of the plague, a clearness\r\nof intellect is again shewn by Santa Sofia, which reflects credit on\r\nthe age. It seemed to him to depend, 1st, on an evacuation of putrid\r\nmatters, by purgatives and bleeding: yet he did not sanction the\r\nemployment of these means indiscriminately, and without consideration;\r\nleast of all where the condition of the blood was healthy. He also\r\ndeclared himself decidedly against bleeding ad deliquium (venæ sectio\r\neradicativa). 2d, Strengthening of the heart and prevention of\r\nputrescence. 3d, Appropriate regimen. 4th, Improvement of the air.\r\n5th, Appropriate treatment of tumid glands and inflammatory boils,\r\nwith emollient, or even stimulating poultices (mustard, lily-bulbs),\r\nas well as with red-hot gold and iron. Lastly, 6th, Attention to\r\nprominent symptoms. The stores of the Arabian pharmacy, which he\r\nbrought into action to meet all these indications, were indeed very\r\nconsiderable; it is to be observed, however, that, for the most part,\r\ngentle means were accumulated, which, in case of abuse, would do no\r\nharm; for the character of the Arabian system of medicine, whose\r\nprinciples were everywhere followed at this time, was mildness and\r\ncaution. On this account too, we cannot believe that a very prolix\r\ntreatise by Marsigli di Santa Sofia[180], a contemporary relative of\r\nGaleazzo, on the prevention and treatment of plague, can have caused\r\nmuch harm, although, perhaps, even in the 14th century, an agreeable\r\nlatitude and confident assertions respecting things which no mortal\r\nhas investigated, or which it is quite a matter of indifference to\r\ndistinguish, were considered as proofs of a valuable practical talent.\r\n\r\nThe agreement of contemporary and later writers, shews that the\r\npublished views of the most celebrated physicians of the 14th century,\r\nwere those generally adopted. Among these, Chalin de Vinario is\r\nthe most experienced. Though devoted to astrology, still more than\r\nhis distinguished contemporary, he acknowledges the great power of\r\nterrestrial influences, and expresses himself very sensibly on the\r\nindisputable doctrine of contagion, endeavouring thereby to apologize\r\nfor many surgeons and physicians of his time, who neglected their\r\nduty[181]. He asserted boldly, and with truth, “_that all epidemic\r\ndiseases might become contagious[182], and all fevers epidemic_,” which\r\nattentive observers of all subsequent ages have confirmed.\r\n\r\nHe delivered his sentiments on blood-letting with sagacity, as an\r\nexperienced physician; yet he was unable, as may be imagined, to\r\nmoderate the desire for bleeding shewn by the ignorant monks. He was\r\naverse to draw blood from the veins of patients under fourteen years\r\nof age; but counteracted inflammatory excitement in them by cupping;\r\nand endeavoured to moderate the inflammation of the tumid glands by\r\nleeches[183]. Most of those who were bled, died; he therefore reserved\r\nthis remedy for the plethoric; especially for the papal courtiers,\r\nand the hypocritical priests, whom he saw gratifying their sensual\r\ndesires, and imitating Epicurus, whilst they pompously pretended to\r\nfollow Christ[184]. He recommended burning the boils with a red-hot\r\niron, only in the plague without fever, which occurred in single\r\ncases[185]; and was always ready to correct those over-hasty surgeons,\r\nwho, with fire and violent remedies, did irremediable injury to their\r\npatients[186]. Michael Savonarola, professor in Ferrara (1462),\r\nreasoning on the susceptibility of the human frame to the influence of\r\npestilential infection, as the cause of such various modifications of\r\ndisease, expresses himself as a modern physician would on this point;\r\nand an adoption of the principle of contagion was the foundation of\r\nhis definition of the plague[187]. No less worthy of observation are\r\nthe views of the celebrated Valescus of Taranta, who, during the final\r\nvisitation of the Black Death, in 1382, practised as a physician at\r\nMontpellier, and handed down to posterity what has been repeated in\r\ninnumerable treatises on plague, which were written during the 15th and\r\n16th centuries[188].\r\n\r\nOf all these notions and views regarding the plague, whose development\r\nwe have represented, there are two especially, which are prominent in\r\nhistorical importance:—1st, The opinion of learned physicians, that the\r\n_pestilence_, or epidemic constitution, is the _parent of various kinds\r\nof disease_; that the plague sometimes, indeed, but by no means always,\r\noriginates from it: that, to speak in the language of the moderns, _the\r\npestilence_ bears the same relation to contagion, that a predisposing\r\ncause does to an occasional cause: and 2dly, the universal conviction\r\nof the contagious power of that disease.\r\n\r\nContagion gradually attracted more notice: it was thought that in it,\r\nthe most powerful occasional cause might be avoided; the possibility of\r\nprotecting whole cities by separation, became gradually more evident;\r\nand so horrifying was the recollection of the eventful year of the\r\n“_Great Mortality_,” that before the close of the 14th century, ere\r\nthe ill effects of the Black Plague had ceased, nations endeavoured to\r\nguard against the return of this enemy, by an earnest and effectual\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\nThe first regulation which was issued for this purpose, originated\r\nwith Viscount Bernabo, and is dated the 17th Jan. 1374. “Every\r\nplague-patient was to be taken out of the city into the fields, there\r\nto die or to recover. Those who attended upon a plague-patient, were\r\nto remain apart for ten days, before they again associated with\r\nany body. The priests were to examine the diseased, and point out\r\nto special commissioners the persons infected; under punishment of\r\nthe confiscation of their goods, and of being burned alive. Whoever\r\nimported the plague, the state condemned his goods to confiscation.\r\nFinally, none except those who were appointed for that purpose, were to\r\nattend plague-patients, under penalty of death and confiscation[189].”\r\n\r\nThese orders, in correspondence with the spirit of the 14th century,\r\nare sufficiently decided to indicate a recollection of the good effects\r\nof confinement, and of keeping at a distance those suspected of having\r\nplague. It was said that Milan itself, by a rigorous barricado of three\r\nhouses in which the plague had broken out, maintained itself free from\r\nthe “_Great Mortality_,” for a considerable time[190]; and examples\r\nof the preservation of individual families, by means of a strict\r\nseparation, were certainly very frequent. That these orders must have\r\ncaused universal affliction from their uncommon severity, as we know\r\nto have been especially the case in the city of Reggio, may be easily\r\nconceived; but Bernabo did not suffer himself to be deterred from his\r\npurpose by fear—on the contrary, when the plague returned in the year\r\n1383, he forbad the admission of people from infected places into his\r\nterritories, on pain of death[191]. We have now, it is true, no account\r\nhow far he succeeded; yet it is to be supposed that he arrested the\r\ndisease, for it had long lost the property of the Black Death, to\r\nspread abroad in the air the contagious matter which proceeded from the\r\nlungs, charged with putridity, and to taint the atmosphere of whole\r\ncities by the vast numbers of the sick. Now that it had resumed its\r\nmilder form, so that it infected only by contact, it admitted being\r\nconfined within individual dwellings, as easily as in modern times.\r\n\r\nBernabo’s example was imitated; nor was there any century more\r\nappropriate for recommending to governments strong regulations against\r\nthe plague, than the 14th; for when it broke out in Italy, in the year\r\n1399, and still demanded new victims, it was for the 16th time; without\r\nreckoning frequent visitations of measles and small-pox. In this same\r\nyear, Viscount John, in milder terms than his predecessor, ordered that\r\nno stranger should be admitted from infected places, and that the city\r\ngates should be strictly guarded. Infected houses were to be ventilated\r\nfor at least eight or ten days, and purified from noxious vapours\r\nby fires, and by fumigations with balsamic and aromatic substances.\r\nStraw, rags, and the like, were to be burned; and the bedsteads which\r\nhad been used, set out for four days in the rain or the sunshine, so\r\nthat, by means of the one or the other, the morbific vapour might be\r\ndestroyed. No one was to venture to make use of clothes or beds out of\r\ninfected dwellings, unless they had been previously washed and dried\r\neither at the fire or in the sun. People were, likewise, to avoid,\r\nas long as possible, occupying houses which had been frequented by\r\nplague-patients[192].\r\n\r\nWe cannot precisely perceive in these an advance towards general\r\nregulations; and perhaps people were convinced of the insurmountable\r\nimpediments which opposed the separation of open inland countries,\r\nwhere bodies of people connected together could not be brought, even\r\nby the most obdurate severity, to renounce the habit of a profitable\r\nintercourse.\r\n\r\nDoubtless it is nature which has done the most to banish the Oriental\r\nplague from western Europe, where the increasing cultivation of the\r\nearth, and the advancing order in civilized society, have prevented it\r\nfrom remaining domesticated; which it most probably was in the more\r\nancient times.\r\n\r\nIn the 15th century, during which it broke out seventeen times in\r\ndifferent places in Europe[193], it was of the more consequence to\r\noppose a barrier to its entrance from Asia, Africa, and Greece (which\r\nhad become Turkish); for it would have been difficult for it to\r\nmaintain itself indigenously any longer. Among the southern commercial\r\nstates, however, which were called on to make the greatest exertions to\r\nthis end, it was principally Venice, formerly so severely attacked by\r\nthe Black Plague, that put the necessary restraint upon the perilous\r\nprofits of the merchant. Until towards the end of the 15th century, the\r\nvery considerable intercourse with the East was free and unimpeded.\r\nShips of commercial cities had often brought over the plague: nay, the\r\nformer irruption of the “_Great Mortality_” itself had been occasioned\r\nby navigators. For, as in the latter end of Autumn, 1347, four ships\r\nfull of plague-patients returned from the Levant to Genoa, the disease\r\nspread itself there with astonishing rapidity. On this account, in the\r\nfollowing year, the Genoese forbad the entrance of suspected ships into\r\ntheir port. These sailed to Pisa and other cities on the coast, where\r\nalready nature had made such mighty preparations for the reception of\r\nthe Black Plague, and what we have already described took place in\r\nconsequence[194].\r\n\r\nIn the year 1485, when, among the cities of northern Italy, Milan\r\nespecially felt the scourge of the plague, a special council of\r\nhealth, consisting of three nobles, was established at Venice, who\r\nprobably tried every thing in their power to prevent the entrance of\r\nthis disease, and gradually called into activity all those regulations\r\nwhich have served in later times as a pattern for the other southern\r\nstates of Europe. Their endeavours were, however, not crowned with\r\ncomplete success; on which account their powers were increased, in the\r\nyear 1504, by granting them the right of life and death over those who\r\nviolated the regulations[195]. Bills of health were probably first\r\nintroduced in the year 1527, during a fatal plague[196] which visited\r\nItaly for five years (1525–30), and called forth redoubled caution.\r\n\r\nThe first lazarettos were established upon islands at some distance\r\nfrom the city, seemingly as early as the year 1485. Here all strangers\r\ncoming from places where the existence of plague was suspected were\r\ndetained. If it appeared in the city itself, the sick were despatched\r\nwith their families to what was called the Old Lazaretto, were there\r\nfurnished with provisions and medicines, and, when they were cured,\r\nwere detained, together with all those who had had intercourse with\r\nthem, still forty days longer in the New Lazaretto, situated on another\r\nisland. All these regulations were every year improved, and their\r\nneedful rigour was increased, so that from the year 1585 onwards, no\r\nappeal was allowed from the sentence of the Council of Health; and\r\nthe other commercial nations gradually came to the support of the\r\nVenetians, by adopting corresponding regulations[197]. Bills of health,\r\nhowever, were not general until the year 1665[198].\r\n\r\nThe appointment of a forty days’ detention, whence quarantines derive\r\ntheir name, was not dictated by caprice, but probably had a medical\r\norigin, which is derivable in part from the doctrine of critical\r\ndays; for the fortieth day, according to the most ancient notions,\r\nhas been always regarded as the last of ardent diseases, and the\r\nlimit of separation between these and those which are chronic. It was\r\nthe custom to subject lying-in women for forty days to a more exact\r\nsuperintendence. There was a good deal also said in medical works of\r\nforty day epochs in the formation of the fœtus, not to mention that\r\nthe alchymists expected more durable revolutions in forty days, which\r\nperiod they called the philosophical month.\r\n\r\nThis period being generally held to prevail in natural processes, it\r\nappeared reasonable to assume, and legally to establish it, as that\r\nrequired for the development of latent principles of contagion, since\r\npublic regulations cannot dispense with decisions of this kind, even\r\nthough they should not be wholly justified by the nature of the case.\r\nGreat stress has likewise been laid on theological and legal grounds,\r\nwhich were certainly of greater weight in the fifteenth century than in\r\nmore modern times[199].\r\n\r\nOn this matter, however, we cannot decide, since our only object here\r\nis to point out the origin of a political means of protection against a\r\ndisease, which has been the greatest impediment to civilization within\r\nthe memory of man; a means, that, like Jenner’s vaccine, after the\r\nsmall-pox had ravaged Europe for twelve hundred years, has diminished\r\nthe check which mortality puts on the progress of civilization, and\r\nthus given to the life and manners of the nations of this part of the\r\nworld a new direction, the result of which we cannot foretell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  I.\r\n\r\n                         Das alte Geisslerlied\r\n\r\n     NACH MASSMANN’S AUSGABE VON HERRN PROFESSOR LACHMANN MIT DER\r\n                        HANDSCHRIFT VERGLICHEN.\r\n\r\n    Sve siner sele wille pleghen\r\n    De sal gelden unde weder geuen\r\n    So wert siner sele raed\r\n    Des help uns leue herre goed\r\n      Nu tredet here we botsen wille             5\r\n    Vle wi io de hetsen helle\r\n    Lucifer is en bose geselle\r\n    Sven her hauet\r\n    Mit peke he en lauet\r\n    Datz vle wi ef wir hauen sin                10\r\n    Des help uns maria koninghin\r\n    Das wir dines kindes hulde win\r\n      Jesus crist de wart ge vanghen\r\n    An en cruce wart he ge hanghen\r\n    Dat cruce wart des blodes rod               15\r\n    Wer klaghen sin marter unde sin dod\r\n    Sunder war mide wilt tu mi lonen\r\n    Dre negele unde en dornet crone\r\n    Das cruce vrone en sper en stich\r\n    Sunder datz leyd ich dor dich               20\r\n    Was wltu nu liden dor mich\r\n    So rope wir herre mit luden done\r\n    Unsen denst den nem to lone\r\n    Be hode uns vor der helle nod\r\n    Des bidde wi dich dor dinen dod             25\r\n    Dor god vor gete wi unse blot\r\n    Dat is uns tho den suden guot\r\n      Maria muoter koninginghe\r\n    Dor dines leuen kindes minne\r\n    Al unse nod si dir ghe klaghet              30\r\n    Des help uns moter maghet reyne.\r\n    De erde beuet och kleuen de steyne\r\n    Lebe hertze du salt weyne\r\n    Wir wenen trene mit den oghen\r\n    Unde hebben des so guden louen              35\r\n    Mit unsen sinnen unde mit hertzen\r\n    Dor uns leyd crist vil manighen smertzen\r\n      Nu slaed w sere\r\n    Dor cristus ere.\r\n    Dor god nu latet de sunde mere              40\r\n    Dor god nu latet de sunde varen\r\n    Se wil sich god ouer uns en barmen\r\n      Maria stund in grotzen noden\r\n    Do se ire leue kint sa doden\r\n    En svert dor ire sele snet                  45\r\n    Sunder dat la di wesen led\r\n      In korter vrist\r\n    God tornich ist\r\n    Jesus wart gelauet mid gallen\r\n    Des sole wi an en cruce vallen              50\r\n    Er heuet uch mit uwen armen\r\n    Dat sic god ouer uns en barme\r\n    Jesus dorch dine namen dry\r\n    Nu make uns hir van sunde vry\r\n    Jesus dor dine wnden rod                    55\r\n    Be hod uns vor den gehen dod\r\n    Dat he sende sinen geist\r\n    Und uns dat kortelike leist\r\n      De vrowe unde man ir e tobreken\r\n    Dat wil god selven an en wreken             60\r\n    Sveuel pik und och de galle\r\n    Dat gutet de duuel in se alle\r\n    Vor war sint se des duuels spot\r\n    Dor vor behode uns herre god\r\n    De e de ist en reyne leuen                  65\r\n    De had uns god selven gheuen\r\n      Ich rade uch vrowen unde mannen\r\n    Dor god gy solen houard annen\r\n    Des biddet uch de arme sele\r\n    Dorch god nu latet houard mere              70\r\n    Dor god nu latet houard varen\r\n    So wil sich god ouer uns en barmen\r\n      Cristus rep in hemelrike\r\n    Sinen engelen al gelike\r\n    De cristenheit wil mi ent wichen            75\r\n    Des wil lan och se vor gaen\r\n    Marie bat ire kint so sere\r\n    Leue kint la se di boten\r\n    Dat wil ich sceppen dat se moten\r\n    Bekeren sich.                               80\r\n    Des bidde ich dich\r\n      Gi logenere\r\n    Gy meynen ed sverer\r\n    Gi bichten reyne und lan de sunde uch ruwen\r\n    So wil sich god in uch vor nuwen            85\r\n    Owe du arme wokerere\r\n    Du bringest en lod up en punt\r\n    Dat senket din an der helle grunt\r\n      Ir morder und ir straten rouere\r\n    Ir sint dem leuen gode un mere              90\r\n    Ir ne wilt uch ouer nemende barmen\r\n    Des sin gy eweliken vor loren\r\n      Were dusse bote nicht ge worden\r\n    De cristenheit wer gar vorsunden\r\n    De leyde duuel had se ge bunden             95\r\n    Maria had lost unsen bant\r\n      Sunder ich saghe di leue mere\r\n    Sunte peter is portenere\r\n    Wende dich an en he letset dich in\r\n    He bringhet dich vor de koninghin          100\r\n      Leue herre sunte Michahel\r\n    Du bist en plegher aller sel\r\n    Be hode uns vor der helle nod\r\n    Dat do dor dines sceppers dod.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 The Ancient Song of the Flagellants.\r\n\r\n           ACCORDING TO MASSMANN’S EDITION COMPARED WITH THE\r\n                      MS.

Many Jews were put to the question, others being excused\r\nfrom it, because they confessed, and were brought to trial and burnt.\r\nSeveral Christians, also, who had poison given them by the Jews for\r\nthe purpose of destroying the Christians, were put on the wheel and\r\ntortured. This burning of the Jews and torturing of the said Christians\r\ntook place in many parts of the county of Savoy.\r\n\r\n                                                       Fare you well.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\n  _The Confession made on the 15th day of September, in the\r\n    year of our Lord 1348, in the Castle of Chillon, by the Jews\r\n    arrested in Neustadt, on the Charge of Poisoning the Wells,\r\n    Springs and other places; also Food, &c., with the design of\r\n    destroying and extirpating all Christians._\r\n\r\nI. Balavignus, a Jewish physician, inhabitant of Thonon, was arrested\r\nat Chillon in consequence of being found in the neighbourhood. He was\r\nput for a short time to the rack, and on being taken down, confessed,\r\nafter much hesitation, that, about ten weeks before, the Rabbi Jacob\r\nof Toledo, who, because of a citation, had resided at Chamberi since\r\nEaster, sent him, by a Jewish boy, some poison in the mummy of an\r\negg: it was a powder sewed up in a thin leathern pouch accompanied by\r\na letter, commanding him, on penalty of excommunication, and by his\r\nrequired obedience to the law, to throw this poison into the larger\r\nand more frequented wells of the town of Thonon, to poison those\r\nwho drew water there. He was further enjoined not to communicate\r\nthe circumstance to any person whatever, under the same penalty. In\r\nconformity with this command of the Jewish rabbis and doctors of the\r\nlaw, he, Balavignus, distributed the poison in several places, and\r\nacknowledged having one evening placed a certain portion under a stone\r\nin a spring on the shore at Thonon. He further confessed that the said\r\nboy brought various letters of a similar import, addressed to others\r\nof his nation, and particularly specified some directed severally to\r\nMossoiet, Banditon, and Samoleto of Neustadt; to Musseo Abramo and\r\nAquetus of Montreantz, Jews residing at Thurn in Vivey; to Benetonus\r\nand his son at St. Moritz; to Vivianus Jacobus, Aquetus and Sonetus,\r\nJews at Aquani. Several letters of a like nature were sent to Abram\r\nand Musset, Jews at Moncheoli; and the boy told him that he had taken\r\nmany others to different and distant places, but he did not recollect\r\nto whom they were addressed. Balavignus further confessed that, after\r\nhaving put the poison into the spring at Thonon, he had positively\r\nforbidden his wife and children to drink the water, but had not thought\r\nfit to assign a reason. He avowed the truth of this statement, and, in\r\nthe presence of several credible witnesses, swore by his law, and the\r\nFive Books of Moses, to every item of his deposition.\r\n\r\nOn the day following, Balavignus, voluntarily and without torture,\r\nratified the above confession verbatim before many persons of\r\ncharacter, and, of his own accord, acknowledged that, on returning one\r\nday from Tour near Vivey, he had thrown into a well below Mustruez,\r\nnamely that of La Conerayde, a quantity of the poison tied up in a rag,\r\ngiven to him for the purpose by Aquetus of Montreantz, an inhabitant of\r\nthe said Tour: that he had acquainted Manssiono, and his son Delosaz,\r\nresidents of Neustadt, with the circumstance of his having done so, and\r\nadvertised them not to drink of the water. He described the colour of\r\nthe poison as being red and black.\r\n\r\nOn the nineteenth day of September, the above-named Balavignus\r\nconfessed, without torture, that about three weeks after Whitsuntide,\r\na Jew named Mussus told him that he had thrown poison into the well,\r\nin the custom-house of that place, the property of the Borneller\r\nfamily; and that he no longer drank the water of this well, but that\r\nof the lake. He further deposed that Mussus informed him that he had\r\nalso laid some of the poison under the stones in the custom-house at\r\nChillon. Search was accordingly made in this well, and the poison\r\nfound: some of it was given to a Jew by way of trial, and he died\r\nin consequence. He also stated that the rabbis had ordered him and\r\nother Jews to refrain from drinking of the water for nine days after\r\nthe poison was infused into it; and immediately on having poisoned\r\nthe waters, he communicated the circumstance to the other Jews. He,\r\nBalavignus, confessed that about two months previously, being at Evian,\r\nhe had some conversation on the subject with a Jew called Jacob, and,\r\namong other things, asked him whether he also had received writings\r\nand poison, and was answered in the affirmative; he then questioned\r\nhim whether he had obeyed the command, and Jacob replied that he had\r\nnot, but had given the poison to Savetus, a Jew, who had thrown it\r\ninto the Well de Morer at Evian. Jacob also desired him, Balavignus,\r\nto execute the command imposed on him with due caution. He confessed\r\nthat Aquetus of Montreantz had informed him that he had thrown some of\r\nthe poison into the well above Tour, the water of which he sometimes\r\ndrank. He confessed that Samolet had told him that he had laid the\r\npoison which he had received, in a well, which, however, he refused to\r\nname to him. Balavignus, as a physician, further deposed that a person\r\ninfected by such poison coming in contact with another while in a state\r\nof perspiration, infection would be the almost inevitable result; as\r\nmight also happen from the breath of an infected person. This fact\r\nhe believed to be correct, and was confirmed in his opinion by the\r\nattestation of many experienced physicians. He also declared that none\r\nof his community could exculpate themselves from this accusation, as\r\nthe plot was communicated to all; and that all were guilty of the above\r\ncharges. Balavignus was conveyed over the lake from Chillon to Clarens,\r\nto point out the well into which he confessed having thrown the powder.\r\nOn landing, he was conducted to the spot; and, having seen the well,\r\nacknowledged that to be the place, saying, “This is the well into which\r\nI put the poison.” The well was examined in his presence, and the linen\r\ncloth in which the poison had been wrapped was found in the wastepipe\r\nby a notary-public named Heinrich Gerhard, in the presence of many\r\npersons, and was shewn to the said Jew. He acknowledged this to be the\r\nlinen which had contained the poison, which he described as being of\r\ntwo colours, red and black, but said that he had thrown it into the\r\nopen well. The linen cloth was taken away and is preserved.\r\n\r\nBalavignus, in conclusion, attests the truth of all and every thing\r\nas above related. He believes this poison to contain a portion of the\r\nbasilisk, because he had heard, and felt assured, that the above poison\r\ncould not be prepared without it.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nII. Banditono, a Jew of Neustadt, was, on the fifteenth day of\r\nSeptember, subjected for a short time to the torture. After a long\r\ninterval, he confessed having cast a quantity of poison, about the size\r\nof a large nut, given him by Musseus, a Jew, at Tour, near Vivey, into\r\nthe well of Carutet, in order to poison those who drank of it.\r\n\r\nThe following day, Banditono, voluntarily and without torture, attested\r\nthe truth of the aforesaid deposition; and also confessed that the\r\nRabbi Jacob von Pasche, who came from Toledo and had settled at\r\nChamberi, sent him, at Pilliex, by a Jewish servant, some poison about\r\nthe size of a large nut, together with a letter directing him to throw\r\nthe powder into the wells on pain of excommunication. He had therefore\r\nthrown the poison, which was sown up in a leathern bag, into the well\r\nof Cercliti de Roch; further, also, that he saw many other letters in\r\nthe hands of the servant addressed to different Jews; that he had also\r\nseen the said servant deliver one, on the outside of the upper gate,\r\nto Samuletus, the Jew, at Neustadt. He stated, also, that the Jew,\r\nMassolet, had informed him that he had put poison into the well near\r\nthe bridge at Vivey.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nIII. The said Manssiono, Jew of Neustadt, was put upon the rack on\r\nthe fifteenth day of the same month, but refused to admit the above\r\ncharge, protesting his entire ignorance of the whole matter; but the\r\nday following, he, voluntarily and without any torture, confessed,\r\nin the presence of many persons, that he came from Mancheolo one day\r\nin last Whitsun-week, in company with a Jew named Provenzal, and, on\r\nreaching the well of Chabloz Crüez between Vyona and Mura, the latter\r\nsaid, “You must put some of the poison which I will give you into that\r\nwell, or woe betide you!” He therefore took a portion of the powder\r\nabout the bigness of a nut, and did as he was directed. He believed\r\nthat the Jews in the neighbourhood of Evian had convened a council\r\namong themselves relative to this plot, before Whitsuntide. He further\r\nsaid that Balavignus had informed him of his having poisoned the well\r\nde la Conerayde below Mustruez. He also affirmed his conviction of the\r\nculpability of the Jews in this affair, stating that they were fully\r\nacquainted with all the particulars, and guilty of the alleged crime.\r\n\r\nOn the third day of the October following, Manssiono was brought before\r\nthe commissioners, and did not in the least vary from his former\r\ndeposition, or deny having put the poison into the said wells.\r\n\r\nThe above-named Jews, prior to their execution, solemnly swore by\r\ntheir Law to the truth of their several depositions, and declared that\r\nall Jews whatsoever, from seven years old and upwards, could not be\r\nexempted from the charge of guilt, as all of them were acquainted with\r\nthe plot, and more or less participators in the crime.\r\n\r\n[_The seven other examinations scarcely differ from the above, except\r\nin the names of the accused, and afford but little variety. We will,\r\ntherefore, only add a characteristic passage at the conclusion of this\r\ndocument. The whole speaks for itself._]\r\n\r\nThere still remain numerous proofs and accusations against the\r\nabove-mentioned Jews: also against Jews and Christians in different\r\nparts of the county of Savoy, who have already received the punishment\r\ndue to their heinous crime; which, however, I have not at hand, and\r\ncannot therefore send you. I must add, that all the Jews of Neustadt\r\nwere burnt according to the just sentence of the law. At Augst, I was\r\npresent when three Christians were flayed on account of being accessory\r\nto the plot of poisoning. Very many Christians were arrested for this\r\ncrime in various places in this country, especially at Evian, Gebenne,\r\nKrusilien and Hochstett, who at last and in their dying moments were\r\nbrought to confess and acknowledge that they had received the poison\r\nfrom the Jews. Of these Christians some have been quartered; others\r\nflayed and afterwards hanged. Certain commissioners have been appointed\r\nby the magistrates to enforce judgment against all the Jews; and I\r\nbelieve that none will escape.\r\n\r\n\r\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|                             FOOTNOTES:                               |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [1] I might here enlarge on the general importance of the study of   |\r\n| epidemics; but this has been so fully set forth in the author’s      |\r\n| Address to the Physicians of Germany, which immediately follows, as  |\r\n| well as in the Preface to the Sweating Sickness, at p. 177, that     |\r\n| any further observations on this subject would be superfluous on my  |\r\n| part.                                                                |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [2] στε καὶ ἐλέχθη ὑπ’ αὐτῶν ὡς οἱ Πελοποννήσιοι φάρμακα             |\r\n| ἐσβεβλήκοιεν ἐς τὰ φρέατα. _Thucyd.

The pilgrimages of the Flagellants of  |\r\n| the year 1349, were not the last. Later in the 14th century this     |\r\n| fanaticism still manifested itself several times, though never to    |\r\n| so great an extent: in the 15th century, it was deemed necessary,    |\r\n| in several parts of Germany, to extirpate them by fire and sword;    |\r\n| and in the year 1710, processions of the Cross-bearers were still    |\r\n| seen in Italy. How deeply this mania had taken root, is proved by    |\r\n| the deposition of a citizen of Nordhäusen (1446): that his wife,     |\r\n| in the belief of performing a Christian act, wanted to scourge her   |\r\n| children, as soon as they were baptized.                             |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [123] _Königshoven_, p. 298:                                         |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n|     “_Stant uf durch der reinen Martel ere;                          |\r\n|      Und hüte dich vor der Sünden mere._”                            |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [124] _Guill. de Nang._ loc. cit.                                    |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [125] _Albert.

He has, no doubt,\r\nalready observed, that joy will affect the circulation, grief the\r\ndigestion; that anger will heat the frame as perniciously as ardent\r\nspirits, and that fear will chill it as certainly as ice; but he may\r\nnot have carried his observation to the extent of perceiving, that not\r\nonly single and transient effects, but specific diseases are produced\r\nthrough the agency of mental impressions, and he may therefore still\r\nbe surprised to find that the dances of St. John and of St. Vitus, as\r\nthey formerly spread by sympathy from city to city, gave rise to the\r\nsame deviations from bodily health, in all the individuals whom they\r\nattacked; that Tarantism was the same disease, whether medically or\r\nmorally considered, all over Italy; and that the “Lycanthropia,” of\r\nthe past, and the “Leaping Ague” of the present times, have each its\r\nrespective train of peculiar symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe moralist will view these records of human frailty in a different\r\nlight; he will examine the state of society which favoured the\r\npropagation of such maladies; he will inquire how far they have been\r\nthe offspring of the ages in which they appeared, and although he may\r\nnot be disposed to think with our author, that they can never return,\r\nhe will at least deduce from the facts here laid before him, that they\r\noriginate in those minds, whether ignorant or ill-educated, in which\r\nthe imagination is permitted to usurp the power of sober sense, and\r\nthe ideal is allowed to occupy the thoughts to the exclusion of the\r\nsubstantial.\r\n\r\nThat such minds are most frequently to be met with in an age of\r\nignorance, we should naturally suppose, and we are borne out in that\r\nsupposition by the fact, that these diseases have been declining in\r\nproportion to the advance of knowledge; but credulity and enthusiasm\r\nare not incompatible with a high degree of civilization: and if, among\r\nthe educated classes, the female sex is more sentimental than the male,\r\nand the affluent are more credulous than those who are dependent on\r\ntheir own exertions for their support, it is to be accounted for by\r\nthe fact, that they usually devote more leisure to the pleasurable\r\ncontemplation of works of imagination, and are less imperatively\r\ncalled on to improve their judgment by the dry study of facts, and\r\nthe experience acquired in the serious business of life. But there is\r\nno class, even in this age of boasted reason, wholly exempt from the\r\nbaneful influence of fanaticism; and instances are not wanting, in\r\nour own days, and in this very capital, to prove, that disorders (how\r\ncan we more charitably designate them?) much resembling some of those\r\ndescribed in the following pages, may make their appearance among\r\npeople who have had all the advantages of an enlightened education, and\r\nevery opportunity of enlarging their minds by a free intercourse with\r\nrefined society.\r\n\r\nI thus venture to hope, that by bestowing a leisure hour on this small\r\nportion of medical history, the physician may enlarge his knowledge\r\nof disease, and the moralist may gather a hint for the intellectual\r\nimprovement of his fellow-men. The author has, however, a more extended\r\nobject in view—the histories of particular epidemics are with him but\r\nthe data from which we are to deduce the general laws that govern\r\nhuman health in the aggregate. Whether there be such an _entity_ as\r\ncollective organic life, and whether, as a consequence, there exist\r\ngeneral laws which regulate its healthy or morbid condition, I do not\r\nhere undertake to determine; but the notion is peculiar, and in order\r\nthat it may be more fully exposed to the reader, I have translated as\r\nan introduction to the present volume[203], an Appeal which Dr. Hecker\r\nhas made to the medical profession of his own country for assistance\r\nin his undertaking. If, in the course of the remarks contained in this\r\naddress, he has been somewhat severe in his censure of the neglect,\r\nboth in this country and in France, of the study of Medical History, I\r\nfreely confess myself to be one of those who are more anxious to profit\r\nby his castigation than to dispute its justice.\r\n\r\nI have added a few Notes, which I trust will be found not inapplicable.\r\nThey consist chiefly of parallel accounts in illustration of what is\r\nset forth in the text; and with the same view, I have thrown together\r\nin No. V. of the Appendix, some Histories of Local Epidemics, and have\r\nreferred to some single cases, which seem to me to have a peculiar\r\ninterest in connexion with the subject of this work, and to render it,\r\non the whole, more complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe diseases which form the subject of the present investigation afford\r\na deep insight into the workings of the human mind in a state of\r\nsociety. They are a portion of history, and will never return in the\r\nform in which they are there recorded; but they expose a vulnerable\r\npart of man—the instinct of imitation—and are therefore very nearly\r\nconnected with human life in the aggregate. It appeared worth while to\r\ndescribe diseases which are propagated on the beams of light—on the\r\nwings of thought; which convulse the mind by the excitement of the\r\nsenses, and wonderfully affect the nerves, the media of its will and of\r\nits feelings. It seemed worth while to attempt to place these disorders\r\nbetween the epidemics of a less refined origin, which affect the body\r\nmore than the soul, and all those passions and emotions which border on\r\nthe vast domain of disease, ready at every moment to pass the boundary.\r\nShould we be able to deduce from the grave facts of history here\r\ndeveloped, a convincing proof that the human race, amidst the creation\r\nwhich surrounds it, moves in body and soul as an individual whole, the\r\nAuthor might hope that he had approached nearer to his ideal of a grand\r\ncomprehension of diseases in time and space, and be encouraged, by the\r\nco-operation of contemporaries, zealous in the search of truth, to\r\nproceed along the path which he has already entered, in prosecuting the\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE DANCING MANIA.\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n           THE DANCING MANIA IN GERMANY AND THE NETHERLANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECT. 1.—ST. JOHN’S DANCE.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the _Black Death_ had not yet subsided, and the graves\r\nof millions of its victims were scarcely closed, when a strange\r\ndelusion arose in Germany, which took possession of the minds of men,\r\nand, in spite of the divinity of our nature, hurried away body and soul\r\ninto the magic circle of hellish superstition. It was a convulsion\r\nwhich in the most extraordinary manner infuriated the human frame,\r\nand excited the astonishment of contemporaries for more than two\r\ncenturies, since which time it has never reappeared. It was called\r\nthe dance of St. John or of St. Vitus, on account of the Bacchantic\r\nleaps by which it was characterized, and which gave to those affected,\r\nwhilst performing their wild dance, and screaming and foaming with\r\nfury, all the appearance of persons possessed. It did not remain\r\nconfined to particular localities, but was propagated by the sight of\r\nthe sufferers, like a demoniacal epidemic, over the whole of Germany\r\nand the neighbouring countries to the north-west, which were already\r\nprepared for its reception by the prevailing opinions of the times.\r\n\r\nSo early as the year 1374, assemblages of men and women were seen at\r\nAix-la-Chapelle who had come out of Germany, and who, united by one\r\ncommon delusion, exhibited to the public both in the streets and in\r\nthe churches the following strange spectacle[204]. They formed circles\r\nhand in hand, and appearing to have lost all control over their senses,\r\ncontinued dancing, regardless of the bystanders, for hours together,\r\nin wild delirium, until at length they fell to the ground in a state\r\nof exhaustion. They then complained of extreme oppression, and groaned\r\nas if in the agonies of death, until they were swathed in cloths bound\r\ntightly round their waists, upon which they again recovered, and\r\nremained free from complaint until the next attack. This practice of\r\nswathing was resorted to on account of the tympany which followed these\r\nspasmodic ravings, but the bystanders frequently relieved patients in\r\na less artificial manner, by thumping and trampling upon the parts\r\naffected. While dancing they neither saw nor heard, being insensible to\r\nexternal impressions through the senses, but were haunted by visions,\r\ntheir fancies conjuring up spirits whose names[205] they shrieked\r\nout; and some of them afterwards asserted that they felt as if they\r\nhad been immersed in a stream of blood, which obliged them to leap so\r\nhigh[206]. Others, during the paroxysm, saw the heavens open and the\r\nSaviour enthroned with the Virgin Mary, according as the religious\r\nnotions of the age were strangely and variously reflected in their\r\nimaginations[207].\r\n\r\nWhere the disease was completely developed, the attack commenced\r\nwith epileptic convulsions[208]. Those affected fell to the ground\r\nsenseless, panting and labouring for breath. They foamed at the mouth,\r\nand suddenly springing up began their dance amidst strange contortions.\r\nYet the malady doubtless made its appearance very variously, and was\r\nmodified by temporary or local circumstances, whereof non-medical\r\ncontemporaries but imperfectly noted the essential particulars,\r\naccustomed as they were to confound their observation of natural events\r\nwith their notions of the world of spirits.\r\n\r\nIt was but a few months ere this demoniacal disease had spread from\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, where it appeared in July, over the neighbouring\r\nNetherlands[209]. In Liege, Utrecht, Tongres, and many other towns of\r\nBelgium, the dancers appeared with garlands in their hair, and their\r\nwaists girt with cloths, that they might, as soon as the paroxysm\r\nwas over, receive immediate relief on the attack of the tympany.\r\nThis bandage was, by the insertion of a stick, easily twisted tight:\r\nmany, however, obtained more relief from kicks and blows, which they\r\nfound numbers of persons ready to administer; for, wherever the\r\ndancers appeared, the people assembled in crowds to gratify their\r\ncuriosity with the frightful spectacle. At length the increasing\r\nnumber of the affected excited no less anxiety than the attention\r\nthat was paid to them. In towns and villages they took possession of\r\nthe religious houses, processions were everywhere instituted on their\r\naccount, and masses were said and hymns were sung, while the disease\r\nitself, of the demoniacal origin of which no one entertained the\r\nleast doubt, excited everywhere astonishment and horror. In Liege the\r\npriests had recourse to exorcisms, and endeavoured, by every means\r\nin their power, to allay an evil which threatened so much danger to\r\nthemselves; for the possessed assembling in multitudes, frequently\r\npoured forth imprecations against them, and menaced their destruction.\r\nThey intimidated the people also to such a degree that there was an\r\nexpress ordinance issued that no one should make any but square-toed\r\nshoes, because these fanatics had manifested a morbid dislike to\r\nthe pointed shoes which had come into fashion immediately after the\r\n_Great Mortality_ in 1350[210]. They were still more irritated at\r\nthe sight of red colours, the influence of which on the disordered\r\nnerves might lead us to imagine an extraordinary accordance between\r\nthis spasmodic malady and the condition of infuriated animals; but in\r\nthe St. John’s dancers this excitement was probably connected with\r\napparitions consequent upon their convulsions. There were likewise some\r\nof them who were unable to endure the sight of persons weeping[211].\r\nThe clergy seemed to become daily more and more confirmed in their\r\nbelief that those who were affected were a kind of sectarians, and\r\non this account they hastened their exorcisms as much as possible,\r\nin order that the evil might not spread amongst the higher classes,\r\nfor hitherto scarcely any but the poor had been attacked, and the few\r\npeople of respectability among the laity and clergy who were to be\r\nfound among them, were persons whose natural frivolity was unable to\r\nwithstand the excitement of novelty, even though it proceeded from\r\na demoniacal influence. Some of the affected had indeed themselves\r\ndeclared, when under the influence of priestly forms of exorcism,\r\nthat if the demons had been allowed only a few weeks more time, they\r\nwould have entered the bodies of the nobility and princes, and through\r\nthese have destroyed the clergy. Assertions of this sort, which those\r\npossessed uttered whilst in a state which may be compared with that of\r\nmagnetic sleep, obtained general belief, and passed from mouth to mouth\r\nwith wonderful additions. The priesthood were, on this account, so much\r\nthe more zealous in their endeavours to anticipate every dangerous\r\nexcitement of the people, as if the existing order of things could have\r\nbeen seriously threatened by such incoherent ravings. Their exertions\r\nwere effectual, for exorcism was a powerful remedy in the fourteenth\r\ncentury; or it might perhaps be that this wild infatuation terminated\r\nin consequence of the exhaustion which naturally ensued from it; at all\r\nevents, in the course of ten or eleven months the St. John’s dancers\r\nwere no longer to be found in any of the cities of Belgium. The evil,\r\nhowever, was too deeply rooted to give way altogether to such feeble\r\nattacks[212].\r\n\r\nA few months after this dancing malady had made its appearance at\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, it broke out at Cologne, where the number of those\r\npossessed amounted to more than five hundred[213], and about the\r\nsame time at Metz, the streets of which place are said to have been\r\nfilled with eleven hundred dancers[214]. Peasants left their ploughs,\r\nmechanics their workshops, housewives their domestic duties, to join\r\nthe wild revels, and this rich commercial city became the scene of\r\nthe most ruinous disorder. Secret desires were excited, and but too\r\noften found opportunities for wild enjoyment; and numerous beggars,\r\nstimulated by vice and misery, availed themselves of this new complaint\r\nto gain a temporary livelihood. Girls and boys quitted their parents,\r\nand servants their masters, to amuse themselves at the dances of those\r\npossessed, and greedily imbibed the poison of mental infection. Above\r\na hundred unmarried women were seen raving about in consecrated and\r\nunconsecrated places, and the consequences were soon perceived[215].\r\nGangs of idle vagabonds, who understood how to imitate to the life the\r\ngestures and convulsions of those really affected, roved from place\r\nto place seeking maintenance and adventures, and thus, wherever they\r\nwent, spreading this disgusting spasmodic disease like a plague; for\r\nin maladies of this kind the susceptible are infected as easily by the\r\nappearance as by the reality. At last it was found necessary to drive\r\naway these mischievous guests, who were equally inaccessible to the\r\nexorcisms of the priests and the remedies of the physicians. It was\r\nnot, however, until after four months that the Rhenish cities were able\r\nto suppress these impostures, which had so alarmingly increased the\r\noriginal evil. In the mean time, when once called into existence, the\r\nplague crept on, and found abundant food in the tone of thought which\r\nprevailed in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and even, though\r\nin a minor degree, throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth, causing\r\na permanent disorder of the mind, and exhibiting, in those cities to\r\nwhose inhabitants it was a novelty, scenes as strange as they were\r\ndetestable.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   SECT. 2.—ST. VITUS’S DANCE[216].\r\n\r\nStrasburg was visited by the “Dancing Plague” in the year 1418, and\r\nthe same infatuation existed among the people there, as in the towns\r\nof Belgium and the Lower Rhine[217]. Many who were seized at the sight\r\nof those affected, excited attention at first by their confused and\r\nabsurd behaviour, and then by their constantly following the swarms of\r\ndancers. These were seen day and night passing through the streets,\r\naccompanied by musicians playing on bagpipes, and by innumerable\r\nspectators attracted by curiosity, to which were added anxious parents\r\nand relations, who came to look after those among the misguided\r\nmultitude who belonged to their respective families. Imposture and\r\nprofligacy played their part in this city also, but the morbid delusion\r\nitself seems to have predominated. On this account religion could only\r\nbring provisional aid, and therefore the town-council benevolently took\r\nan interest in the afflicted. They divided them into separate parties,\r\nto each of which they appointed responsible superintendents to protect\r\nthem from harm, and perhaps also to restrain their turbulence. They\r\nwere thus conducted on foot and in carriages to the chapels of St.\r\nVitus, near Zabern and Rotestein, where priests were in attendance\r\nto work upon their misguided minds by masses and other religious\r\nceremonies. After divine worship was completed, they were led in\r\nsolemn procession to the altar, where they made some small offering of\r\nalms, and where it is probable that many were, through the influence\r\nof devotion and the sanctity of the place, cured of this lamentable\r\naberration. It is worthy of observation, at all events, that the\r\nDancing Mania did not recommence at the altars of the saint, and that\r\nfrom him alone assistance was implored, and through his miraculous\r\ninterposition a cure was expected, which was beyond the reach of human\r\nskill. The personal history of St. Vitus is by no means unimportant\r\nin this matter. He was a Sicilian youth, who, together with Modestus\r\nand Crescentia, suffered martyrdom at the time of the persecution of\r\nthe Christians, under Diocletian, in the year 303[218]. The legends\r\nrespecting him are obscure, and he would certainly have been passed\r\nover without notice among the innumerable apocryphal martyrs of the\r\nfirst centuries, had not the transfer of his body to St. Denys, and\r\nthence, in the year 836, to Corvey, raised him to a higher rank. From\r\nthis time forth, it may be supposed that many miracles were manifested\r\nat his new sepulchre, which were of essential service in confirming the\r\nRoman faith among the Germans, and St. Vitus was soon ranked among the\r\nfourteen saintly helpers (Nothhelfer or Apotheker[219]). His altars\r\nwere multiplied, and the people had recourse to them in all kinds of\r\ndistresses, and revered him as a powerful intercessor. As the worship\r\nof these saints was, however, at that time stripped of all historical\r\nconnexions, which were purposely obliterated by the priesthood, a\r\nlegend was invented at the beginning of the fifteenth century, or\r\nperhaps even so early as the fourteenth, that St. Vitus had, just\r\nbefore he bent his neck to the sword, prayed to God that he might\r\nprotect from the Dancing Mania all those who should solemnize the day\r\nof his commemoration, and fast upon its eve, and that thereupon a voice\r\nfrom heaven was heard, saying, “Vitus, thy prayer is accepted.”[220]\r\nThus St. Vitus became the patron saint of those afflicted with the\r\ndancing plague, as St. Martin, of Tours, was at one time the succourer\r\nof persons in small-pox; St. Antonius of those suffering under the\r\n“hellish fire,” and as St. Margaret was the Juno Lucina of puerperal\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SECT. 3.—CAUSES.\r\n\r\nThe connexion which John the Baptist had with the dancing mania of\r\nthe fourteenth century, was of a totally different character. He\r\nwas originally far from being a protecting saint to those who were\r\nattacked, or one who would be likely to give them relief from a malady\r\nconsidered as the work of the devil. On the contrary, the manner in\r\nwhich he was worshipped afforded an important and very evident cause\r\nfor its development. From the remotest period, perhaps even so far\r\nback as the fourth century, St. John’s day was solemnized with all\r\nsorts of strange and rude customs, of which the originally mystical\r\nmeaning was variously disfigured among different nations by superadded\r\nrelics of heathenism[221]. Thus the Germans transferred to the festival\r\nof St. John’s day an ancient heathen usage, the kindling of the\r\n“Nodfyr,” which was forbidden them by St. Boniface, and the belief\r\nsubsists even to the present day that people and animals that have\r\nleaped through these flames, or their smoke, are protected for a whole\r\nyear from fevers and other diseases, as if by a kind of baptism by\r\nfire[222]. Bacchanalian dances, which have originated in similar causes\r\namong all the rude nations of the earth, and the wild extravagancies\r\nof a heated imagination, were the constant accompaniments of this\r\nhalf-heathen, half-christian, festival. At the period of which we are\r\ntreating, however, the Germans were not the only people who gave way\r\nto the ebullitions of fanaticism in keeping the festival of St. John\r\nthe Baptist. Similar customs were also to be found among the nations\r\nof Southern Europe and of Asia[223], and it is more than probable that\r\nthe Greeks transferred to the festival of John the Baptist, who is also\r\nheld in high esteem among the Mahomedans, a part of their Bacchanalian\r\nmysteries, an absurdity of a kind which is but too frequently met with\r\nin human affairs. How far a remembrance of the history of St. John’s\r\ndeath may have had an influence on this occasion, we would leave\r\nlearned theologians to decide. It is only of importance here to add,\r\nthat in Abyssinia, a country entirely separated from Europe, where\r\nChristianity has maintained itself in its primeval simplicity against\r\nMahomedanism, John is to this day worshipped, as protecting saint of\r\nthose who are attacked with the dancing malady[224]. In these fragments\r\nof the dominion of mysticism and superstition, historical connexion is\r\nnot to be found.\r\n\r\nWhen we observe, however, that the first dancers in Aix-la-Chapelle\r\nappeared in July with St. John’s name in their mouths, the conjecture\r\nis probable that the wild revels of St. John’s day, A. D. 1374, gave\r\nrise to this mental plague, which thenceforth has visited so many\r\nthousands with incurable aberration of mind, and disgusting distortions\r\nof body.\r\n\r\nThis is rendered so much the more probable, because some months\r\npreviously the districts in the neighbourhood of the Rhine and the\r\nMaine had met with great disasters. So early as February, both these\r\nrivers had overflowed their banks to a great extent; the walls of the\r\ntown of Cologne, on the side next the Rhine, had fallen down, and a\r\ngreat many villages had been reduced to the utmost distress[225].\r\nTo this was added the miserable condition of Western and Southern\r\nGermany. Neither law nor edict could suppress the incessant feuds of\r\nthe Barons, and in Franconia especially, the ancient times of club\r\nlaw appeared to be revived. Security of property there was none;\r\narbitrary will everywhere prevailed; corruption of morals and rude\r\npower rarely met with even a feeble opposition; whence it arose that\r\nthe cruel, but lucrative, persecutions of the Jews, were in many\r\nplaces still practised through the whole of this century, with their\r\nwonted ferocity. Thus, throughout the western parts of Germany, and\r\nespecially in the districts bordering on the Rhine, there was a\r\nwretched and oppressed populace; and if we take into consideration,\r\nthat among their numerous bands many wandered about, whose consciences\r\nwere tormented with the recollection of the crimes which they had\r\ncommitted during the prevalence of the black plague, we shall\r\ncomprehend how their despair sought relief in the intoxication of an\r\nartificial delirium[226]. There is hence good ground for supposing that\r\nthe frantic celebration of the festival of St. John, A. D. 1374, only\r\nserved to bring to a crisis, a malady which had been long impending;\r\nand if we would further inquire how a hitherto harmless usage, which,\r\nlike many others, had but served to keep up superstition, could\r\ndegenerate into so serious a disease, we must take into account the\r\nunusual excitement of men’s minds, and the consequences of wretchedness\r\nand want. The bowels, which in many were debilitated by hunger and bad\r\nfood, were precisely the parts which in most cases were attacked with\r\nexcruciating pain, and the tympanitic state of the intestines, points\r\nout to the intelligent physician, an origin of the disorder which is\r\nwell worth consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n                SECT. 4.—MORE ANCIENT DANCING PLAGUES.\r\n\r\nThe dancing mania of the year 1374 was, in fact, no new disease, but\r\na phenomenon well known in the middle ages, of which many wondrous\r\nstories were traditionally current among the people. In the year 1237,\r\nupwards of a hundred children were said to have been suddenly seized\r\nwith this disease at Erfurt, and to have proceeded dancing and jumping\r\nalong the road to Arnstadt. When they arrived at that place they\r\nfell exhausted to the ground, and, according to an account of an old\r\nchronicle, many of them, after they were taken home by their parents,\r\ndied, and the rest remained affected, to the end of their lives, with\r\na permanent tremor[227]. Another occurrence was related to have taken\r\nplace on the Mosel bridge at Utrecht, on the 17th day of June, A.D.\r\n1278, when two hundred fanatics began to dance, and would not desist\r\nuntil a priest passed who was carrying the Host to a person that was\r\nsick, upon which, as if in punishment of their crime, the bridge gave\r\nway, and they were all drowned[228]. A similar event also occurred\r\nso early as the year 1027, near the convent church of Kolbig, not\r\nfar from Bernburg. According to an oft repeated tradition, eighteen\r\npeasants, some of whose names are still preserved, are said to have\r\ndisturbed divine service on Christmas eve, by dancing and brawling\r\nin the churchyard, whereupon the priest, Ruprecht, inflicted a curse\r\nupon them, that they should dance and scream for a whole year without\r\nceasing. This curse is stated to have been completely fulfilled, so\r\nthat the unfortunate sufferers at length sank knee deep into the\r\nearth, and remained the whole time without nourishment, until they\r\nwere finally released by the intercession of two pious bishops. It is\r\nsaid, that upon this, they fell into a deep sleep, which lasted three\r\ndays, and that four of them died: the rest continuing to suffer all\r\ntheir lives from a trembling of their limbs[229]. It is not worth while\r\nto separate what may have been true, and what the addition of crafty\r\npriests, in this strangely distorted story. It is sufficient that it\r\nwas believed, and related with astonishment and horror throughout\r\nthe middle ages; so that when there was any exciting cause for this\r\ndelirious raving, and wild rage for dancing, it failed not to produce\r\nits effects upon men whose thoughts were given up to a belief in\r\nwonders and apparitions.\r\n\r\nThis disposition of mind, altogether so peculiar to the middle ages,\r\nand which, happily for mankind, has yielded to an improved state of\r\ncivilization and the diffusion of popular instruction, accounts for\r\nthe origin and long duration of this extraordinary mental disorder.\r\nThe good sense of the people recoiled with horror and aversion from\r\nthis heavy plague, which, whenever malevolent persons wished to curse\r\ntheir bitterest enemies and adversaries, was long after used as a\r\nmalediction[230]. The indignation also that was felt by the people\r\nat large against the immorality of the age, was proved by their\r\nascribing this frightful affliction to the inefficacy of baptism by\r\nunchaste priests, as if innocent children were doomed to atone, in\r\nafter years, for this desecration of the sacrament administered by\r\nunholy hands[231]. We have already mentioned what perils the priests\r\nin the Netherlands incurred from this belief. They now, indeed,\r\nendeavoured to hasten their reconciliation with the irritated, and at\r\nthat time very degenerate people[232], by exorcisms, which, with some,\r\nprocured them greater respect than ever, because they thus visibly\r\nrestored thousands of those who were affected. In general, however,\r\nthere prevailed a want of confidence in their efficacy, and then the\r\nsacred rites had as little power in arresting the progress of this\r\ndeeply rooted malady, as the prayers and holy services subsequently\r\nhad at the altars of the greatly revered martyr St. Vitus. We may\r\ntherefore ascribe it to accident merely, and to a certain aversion to\r\nthis demoniacal disease, which seemed to lie beyond the reach of human\r\nskill, that we meet with but few and imperfect notices, of the St.\r\nVitus’s dance in the second half of the fifteenth century. The highly\r\ncoloured descriptions of the sixteenth century contradict the notion\r\nthat this mental plague had in any degree diminished in its severity,\r\nand not a single fact is to be found which supports the opinion, that\r\nany one of the essential symptoms of the disease, not even excepting\r\nthe tympany, had disappeared, or that the disorder itself had become\r\nmilder in its attacks. The physicians never, as it seems, throughout\r\nthe whole of the fifteenth century, undertook the treatment of the\r\ndancing mania, which, according to the prevailing notions, appertained\r\nexclusively to the servants of the church. Against demoniacal disorders\r\nthey had no remedies, and though some at first did promulgate the\r\nopinion, that the malady had its origin in natural circumstances, such\r\nas a hot temperament, and other causes named in the phraseology of the\r\nschools[233], yet these opinions were the less examined, as it did not\r\nappear worth while to divide with a jealous priesthood, the care of a\r\nhost of fanatical vagabonds and beggars.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECT. 5.—PHYSICIANS.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the beginning of the sixteenth century that the St.\r\nVitus’s dance was made the subject of medical research, and stripped\r\nof its unhallowed character as a work of demons. This was effected by\r\nParacelsus, that mighty, but as yet scarcely comprehended reformer\r\nof medicine, whose aim it was to withdraw diseases from the pale of\r\nmiraculous interpositions and saintly influences, and explain their\r\ncauses upon principles deduced from his knowledge of the human frame.\r\n“We will not, however, admit that the saints have power to inflict\r\ndiseases, and that these ought to be named after them, although many\r\nthere are who, in their theology, lay great stress on this supposition,\r\nascribing them rather to God than to nature, which is but idle talk. We\r\ndislike such nonsensical gossip as is not supported by symptoms, but\r\nonly by faith, a thing which is not human, whereon the gods themselves\r\nset no value.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the words which Paracelsus addressed to his contemporaries,\r\nwho were as yet incapable of appreciating doctrines of this sort; for\r\nthe belief in enchantment still remained everywhere unshaken, and faith\r\nin the world of spirits still held men’s minds in so close a bondage\r\nthat thousands were, according to their own conviction, given up as a\r\nprey to the devil; while at the command of religion as well as of law,\r\ncountless piles were lighted, by the flames of which human society was\r\nto be purified.\r\n\r\nParacelsus divides the St. Vitus’s dance into three kinds. First,\r\nthat which arises from imagination (Vitista, Chorea imaginativa,\r\næstimativa), by which the original dancing plague is to be understood.\r\nSecondly, that which arises from sensual desires, depending on the will\r\n(Chorea lasciva). Thirdly, that which arises from corporeal causes\r\n(Chorea naturalis, coacta), which, according to a strange notion of\r\nhis own, he explained by maintaining, that in certain vessels which\r\nare susceptible of an internal pruriency, and thence produce laughter,\r\nthe blood is set in commotion, in consequence of an alteration in the\r\nvital spirits, whereby involuntary fits of intoxicating joy, and a\r\npropensity to dance, are occasioned[234]. To this notion he was, no\r\ndoubt, led from having observed a milder form of St. Vitus’s dance, not\r\nuncommon in his time, which was accompanied by involuntary laughter;\r\nand which bore a resemblance to the hysterical laughter of the moderns,\r\nexcept that it was characterized by more pleasurable sensations,\r\nand by an extravagant propensity to dance. There was no howling,\r\nscreaming, and jumping, as in the severer form; neither was the\r\ndisposition to dance by any means insuperable. Patients thus affected,\r\nalthough they had not a complete control over their understandings,\r\nyet were sufficiently self-possessed, during the attack, to obey the\r\ndirections which they received. There were even some among them who\r\ndid not dance at all, but only felt an involuntary impulse to allay\r\nthe internal sense of disquietude, which is the usual forerunner of\r\nan attack of this kind, by laughter, and quick walking carried to the\r\nextent of producing fatigue[235]. This disorder, so different from the\r\noriginal type, evidently approximates to the modern chorea; or rather\r\nis in perfect accordance with it, even to the less essential symptom\r\nof laughter. A mitigation in the form of the dancing mania had thus\r\nclearly taken place at the commencement of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nOn the communication of the St. Vitus’s dance by sympathy, Paracelsus,\r\nin his peculiar language, expresses himself with great spirit, and\r\nshows a profound knowledge of the nature of sensual impressions, which\r\nfind their way to the heart,—the seat of joys and emotions,—which\r\noverpower the opposition of reason; and whilst “all other qualities and\r\nnatures” are subdued, incessantly impel the patient, in consequence of\r\nhis original compliance, and his all conquering imagination, to imitate\r\nwhat he has seen. On his treatment of the disease, we cannot bestow\r\nany great praise, but must be content with the remark, that it was in\r\nconformity with the notions of the age in which he lived. For the first\r\nkind, which often originated in passionate excitement, he had a mental\r\nremedy, the efficacy of which is not to be despised, if we estimate\r\nits value in connexion with the prevalent opinions of those times.\r\nThe patient was to make an image of himself in wax or resin, and by an\r\neffort of thought to concentrate all his blasphemies and sins in it.\r\n“Without the intervention of any other person, to set his whole mind\r\nand thoughts concerning these oaths in the image;” and when he had\r\nsucceeded in this, he was to burn the image, so that not a particle of\r\nit should remain[236]. In all this there was no mention made of St.\r\nVitus, or any of the other mediatory saints, which is accounted for\r\nby the circumstance, that, at this time, an open rebellion against\r\nthe Romish Church had begun, and the worship of saints was by many\r\nrejected as idolatrous[237]. For the second kind of St. Vitus’s dance,\r\narising from sensual irritation, with which women were far more\r\nfrequently affected than men, Paracelsus recommended harsh treatment\r\nand strict fasting. He directed that the patients should be deprived of\r\ntheir liberty; placed in solitary confinement, and made to sit in an\r\nuncomfortable place, until their misery brought them to their senses\r\nand to a feeling of penitence. He then permitted them gradually to\r\nreturn to their accustomed habits. Severe corporal chastisement was\r\nnot omitted; but, on the other hand, angry resistance on the part of\r\nthe patient was to be sedulously avoided, on the ground that it might\r\nincrease his malady, or even destroy him: moreover, where it seemed\r\nproper, Paracelsus allayed the excitement of the nerves by immersion\r\nin cold water. On the treatment of the third kind we shall not here\r\nenlarge. It was to be effected by all sorts of wonderful remedies,\r\ncomposed of the quintessences; and it would require, to render it\r\nintelligible, a more extended exposition of peculiar principles than\r\nsuits our present purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n        SECT. 6.—DECLINE AND TERMINATION OF THE DANCING PLAGUE.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the St. Vitus’s dance began to decline, so that milder\r\nforms of it appeared more frequently, while the severer cases became\r\nmore rare; and even in these, some of the important symptoms gradually\r\ndisappeared. Paracelsus makes no mention of the tympanites as taking\r\nplace after the attacks, although it may occasionally have occurred;\r\nand Schenck von Graffenberg, a celebrated physician of the latter\r\nhalf of the sixteenth century[238], speaks of this disease as having\r\nbeen frequent only in the time of his forefathers; his descriptions,\r\nhowever, are applicable to the whole of that century, and to the\r\nclose of the fifteenth[239]. The St. Vitus’s dance attacked people\r\nof all stations, especially those who led a sedentary life, such as\r\nshoemakers and tailors; but even the most robust peasants abandoned\r\ntheir labours in the fields, as if they were possessed by evil spirits;\r\nand thus those affected were seen assembling indiscriminately, from\r\ntime to time, at certain appointed places, and, unless prevented by\r\nthe lookers on, continuing to dance without intermission, until their\r\nvery last breath was expended. Their fury and extravagance of demeanour\r\nso completely deprived them of their senses, that many of them dashed\r\ntheir brains out against the walls and corners of buildings, or\r\nrushed headlong into rapid rivers, where they found a watery grave.\r\nRoaring and foaming as they were, the bystanders could only succeed\r\nin restraining them by placing benches and chairs in their way, so\r\nthat, by the high leaps they were thus tempted to take, their strength\r\nmight be exhausted. As soon as this was the case, they fell as it were\r\nlifeless to the ground, and, by very slow degrees, again recovered\r\ntheir strength. Many there were, who, even with all this exertion,\r\nhad not expended the violence of the tempest which raged within\r\nthem, but awoke with newly revived powers, and again and again mixed\r\nwith the crowd of dancers, until at length the violent excitement of\r\ntheir disordered nerves was allayed by the great involuntary exertion\r\nof their limbs; and the mental disorder was calmed by the extreme\r\nexhaustion of the body. Thus the attacks themselves were in these\r\ncases, as in their nature they are in all nervous complaints, necessary\r\ncrises of an inward morbid condition, which was transferred from the\r\nsensorium to the nerves of motion, and, at an earlier period, to the\r\nabdominal plexus, where a deep-seated derangement of the system was\r\nperceptible from the secretion of flatus in the intestines.\r\n\r\nThe cure effected by these stormy attacks was in many cases so perfect,\r\nthat some patients returned to the factory or the plough as if nothing\r\nhad happened. Others, on the contrary, paid the penalty of their folly\r\nby so total a loss of power, that they could not regain their former\r\nhealth, even by the employment of the most strengthening remedies.\r\nMedical men were astonished to observe, that women in an advanced state\r\nof pregnancy were capable of going through an attack of the disease,\r\nwithout the slightest injury to their offspring, which they protected\r\nmerely by a bandage passed round the waist. Cases of this kind were not\r\nunfrequent so late as Schenck’s time. That patients should be violently\r\naffected by music, and their paroxysms brought on and increased by it,\r\nis natural with such nervous disorders; where deeper impressions are\r\nmade through the ear, which is the most intellectual of all the organs,\r\nthan through any of the other senses. On this account the magistrates\r\nhired musicians for the purpose of carrying the St. Vitus’s dancers so\r\nmuch the quicker through the attacks, and directed, that athletic men\r\nshould be sent among them in order to complete the exhaustion, which\r\nhad been often observed to produce a good effect[240]. At the same\r\ntime there was a prohibition against wearing red garments, because,\r\nat the sight of this colour, those affected became so furious, that\r\nthey flew at the persons who wore it, and were so bent upon doing\r\nthem an injury that they could with difficulty be restrained. They\r\nfrequently tore their own clothes whilst in the paroxysm, and were\r\nguilty of other improprieties, so that the more opulent employed\r\nconfidential attendants to accompany them, and to take care that they\r\ndid no harm either to themselves or others. This extraordinary disease\r\nwas, however, so greatly mitigated in Schenck’s time, that the St.\r\nVitus’s dancers had long since ceased to stroll from town to town; and\r\nthat physician, like Paracelsus, makes no mention of the tympanitic\r\ninflation of the bowels. Moreover, most of those affected, were only\r\nannually visited by attacks; and the occasion of them was so manifestly\r\nreferrible to the prevailing notions of that period, that if the\r\nunqualified belief in the supernatural agency of saints could have\r\nbeen abolished, they would not have had any return of the complaint.\r\nThroughout the whole of June, prior to the festival of St. John,\r\npatients felt a disquietude and restlessness which they were unable\r\nto overcome. They were dejected, timid, and anxious; wandered about\r\nin an unsettled state, being tormented with twitching pains, which\r\nseized them suddenly in different parts, and eagerly expected the eve\r\nof St. John’s day, in the confident hope, that by dancing at the altars\r\nof this saint, or of St. Vitus, (for in the Breisgau aid was equally\r\nsought from both,) they would be freed from all their sufferings. This\r\nhope was not disappointed; and they remained, for the rest of the year,\r\nexempt from any further attack, after having thus, by dancing and\r\nraving for three hours, satisfied an irresistible demand of nature.\r\nThere were at that period two chapels in the Breisgau, visited by the\r\nSt. Vitus’s dancers; namely, the Chapel of St. Vitus at Biessen, near\r\nBreisach, and that of St. John, near Wasenweiler; and it is probable\r\nthat in the south-west of Germany, the disease was still in existence\r\nin the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nHowever, it grew every year more rare, so that, at the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century, it was observed only occasionally in its ancient\r\nform. Thus in the spring of the year 1623, G. Horst saw some women who\r\nannually performed a pilgrimage to St. Vitus’s chapel at Drefelhausen,\r\nnear Weissenstein, in the territory of Ulm, that they might wait for\r\ntheir dancing fit there, in the same manner as those in the Breisgau\r\ndid, according to Schenck’s account. They were not satisfied, however,\r\nwith a dance of three hours’ duration, but continued day and night in a\r\nstate of mental aberration, like persons in an ecstacy, until they fell\r\nexhausted to the ground; and when they came to themselves again, they\r\nfelt relieved from a distressing uneasiness and painful sensation of\r\nweight in their bodies, of which they had complained for several weeks\r\nprior to St. Vitus’s day[241].\r\n\r\nAfter this commotion they remained well for the whole year; and such\r\nwas their faith in the protecting power of the saint, that one of them\r\nhad visited this shrine at Drefelhausen more than twenty times, and\r\nanother had already kept the Saint’s day for the thirty-second time at\r\nthis sacred station.\r\n\r\nThe dancing fit itself was excited here, as it probably was in other\r\nplaces, by music, from the effects of which, the patients were thrown\r\ninto a state of convulsion[242]. Many concurrent testimonies serve to\r\nshow that music generally contributed much to the continuance of the\r\nSt. Vitus’s dance, originated, and increased its paroxysms, and was\r\nsometimes the cause of their mitigation. So early as the fourteenth\r\ncentury, the swarms of St. John’s dancers were accompanied by minstrels\r\nplaying upon noisy instruments, who roused their morbid feelings;\r\nand it may readily be supposed that, by the performance of lively\r\nmelodies, and the stimulating effects which the shrill tones of fifes\r\nand trumpets would produce, a paroxysm, that was perhaps but slight\r\nin itself, might, in many cases, be increased to the most outrageous\r\nfury, such as in later times, was purposely induced in order that\r\nthe force of the disease might be exhausted by the violence of its\r\nattack. Moreover, by means of intoxicating music a kind of demoniacal\r\nfestival for the rude multitude was established, which had the effect\r\nof spreading this unhappy malady wider and wider. Soft harmony was,\r\nhowever, employed to calm the excitement of those affected, and it is\r\nmentioned as a character of the tunes played with this view to the St.\r\nVitus’s dancers, that they contained transitions from a quick to a\r\nslow measure, and passed gradually from a high to a low key[243]. It\r\nis to be regretted that no trace of this music has reached our times,\r\nwhich is owing partly to the disastrous events of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, and partly to the circumstance that the disorder was looked\r\nupon as entirely national, and only incidentally considered worthy\r\nof notice by foreign men of learning. If the St. Vitus’s dance was\r\nalready on the decline at the commencement of the seventeenth century,\r\nthe subsequent events were altogether adverse to its continuance. Wars\r\ncarried on with animosity and with various success for thirty years,\r\nshook the west of Europe; and although the unspeakable calamities which\r\nthey brought upon Germany, both during their continuance, and in their\r\nimmediate consequences, were by no means favourable to the advance of\r\nknowledge, yet, with the vehemence of a purifying fire, they gradually\r\neffected the intellectual regeneration of the Germans; superstition, in\r\nher ancient form, never again appeared, and the belief in the dominion\r\nof spirits, which prevailed in the middle ages, lost for ever its once\r\nformidable power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                        DANCING MANIA IN ITALY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECT. 1.—TARANTISM.\r\n\r\nIt was of the utmost advantage to the St. Vitus’s dancers that\r\nthey made choice of a favourite patron saint; for, not to mention\r\nthat people were inclined to compare them to the possessed with\r\nevil spirits, described in the Bible, and thence to consider them\r\nas innocent victims to the power of Satan, the name of their great\r\nintercessor recommended them to general commiseration, and a magic\r\nboundary was thus set to every harsh feeling which might otherwise have\r\nproved hostile to their safety. Other fanatics were not so fortunate,\r\nbeing often treated with the most relentless cruelty whenever the\r\nnotions of the middle ages either excused or commanded it as a\r\nreligious duty[244].\r\n\r\nThus, passing over the innumerable instances of the burning of witches,\r\nwho were, after all, only labouring under a delusion, the Teutonic\r\nknights in Prussia not unfrequently condemned those maniacs to the\r\nstake who imagined themselves to be metamorphosed into wolves[245]—an\r\nextraordinary species of insanity, which, having existed in Greece,\r\nbefore our era, spread, in process of time, over Europe, so that it\r\nwas communicated not only to the Romaic, but also to the German and\r\nSarmatian nations, and descended from the ancients, as a legacy of\r\naffliction to posterity. In modern times, Lycanthropy, such was the\r\nname given to this infatuation, has vanished from the earth, but it\r\nis nevertheless well worthy the consideration of the observer of\r\nhuman aberrations, and a history of it by some writer who is equally\r\nwell acquainted with the middle ages as with antiquity is still a\r\ndesideratum[246]. We leave it, for the present, without further\r\nnotice, and turn to a malady most extraordinary in all its phenomena,\r\nhaving a close connexion with the St. Vitus’s dance, and, by a\r\ncomparison of facts, which are altogether similar, affording us an\r\ninstructive subject for contemplation. We allude to the disease called\r\nTarantism, which made its first appearance in Apulia, and thence spread\r\nover the other provinces of Italy, where, during some centuries, it\r\nprevailed as a great epidemic. In the present times it has vanished,\r\nor at least has lost altogether its original importance, like the St.\r\nVitus’s dance, lycanthropy, and witchcraft.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 SECT. 2.—MOST ANCIENT TRACES.—CAUSES.\r\n\r\nThe learned Nicholas Perotti[247] gives the earliest account of this\r\nstrange disorder. Nobody had the least doubt that it was caused by\r\nthe bite of the _tarantula_[248][249], a ground-spider common in\r\nApulia; and the fear of this insect was so general, that its bite was\r\nin all probability much oftener imagined, or the sting of some other\r\nkind of insect mistaken for it, than actually received. The word\r\n_tarantula_ is apparently the same as _terrantola_, a name given by\r\nthe Italians to the stellio of the old Romans, which was a kind of\r\nlizard[250], said to be poisonous, and invested by credulity with such\r\nextraordinary qualities, that, like the serpent of the Mosaic account\r\nof the Creation, it personified, in the imaginations of the vulgar, the\r\nnotion of cunning, so that even the jurists designated a cunning fraud\r\nby the appellation of a “stellionatus”[251]. Perotti expressly assures\r\nus that this reptile was called by the Romans _tarantula_; and since\r\nhe himself, who was one of the most distinguished authors of his time,\r\nstrangely confounds spiders and lizards together, so that he considers\r\nthe Apulian tarantula, which he ranks among the class of spiders, to\r\nhave the same meaning as the kind of lizard, called ἀσκαλαβώτης[252],\r\nit is the less extraordinary that the unlearned country people of\r\nApulia should confound the much dreaded ground-spider with the fabulous\r\nstar-lizard[253], and appropriate to the one the name of the other. The\r\nderivation of the word tarantula, from the city of Tarentum, or the\r\nriver Thara, in Apulia[254], on the banks of which this insect is said\r\nto have been most frequently found, or at least its bite to have had\r\nthe most venomous effect, seems not to be supported by authority. So\r\nmuch for the name of this famous spider, which, unless we are greatly\r\nmistaken, throws no light whatever upon the nature of the disease in\r\nquestion. Naturalists who, possessing a knowledge of the past, should\r\nnot misapply their talents by employing them in establishing the dry\r\ndistinction of forms, would find here much that calls for research, and\r\ntheir efforts would clear up many a perplexing obscurity.\r\n\r\nPerotti states that the tarantula, that is, the spider so called,\r\nwas not met with in Italy in former times, but that in his day it\r\nhad become common, especially in Apulia, as well as in some other\r\ndistricts. He deserves, however, no great confidence as a naturalist,\r\nnotwithstanding his having delivered lectures in Bologna on medicine\r\nand other sciences[255]. He at least has neglected to prove his\r\nassertion, which is not borne out by any analogous phenomenon observed\r\nin modern times with regard to the history of the spider species. It\r\nis by no means to be admitted that the tarantula did not make its\r\nappearance in Italy before the disease ascribed to its bite became\r\nremarkable, even though tempests more violent than those unexampled\r\nstorms which arose at the time of the Black Death[256] in the middle\r\nof the fourteenth century had set the insect world in motion; for the\r\nspider is little, if at all, susceptible of those cosmical influences\r\nwhich at times multiply locusts and other winged insects to a wonderful\r\nextent, and compel them to migrate.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms which Perotti enumerates as consequent on the bite of the\r\ntarantula agree very exactly with those described by later writers.\r\nThose who were bitten, generally fell into a state of melancholy, and\r\nappeared to be stupified, and scarcely in possession of their senses.\r\nThis condition was, in many cases, united with so great a sensibility\r\nto music, that, at the very first tones of their favourite melodies,\r\nthey sprang up, shouting for joy, and danced on without intermission,\r\nuntil they sank to the ground exhausted and almost lifeless. In others,\r\nthe disease did not take this cheerful turn. They wept constantly, and\r\nas if pining away with some unsatisfied desire, spent their days in the\r\ngreatest misery and anxiety. Others, again, in morbid fits of love,\r\ncast their longing looks on women, and instances of death are recorded,\r\nwhich are said to have occurred under a paroxysm of either laughing or\r\nweeping.\r\n\r\nFrom this description, incomplete as it is, we may easily gather that\r\ntarantism, the essential symptoms of which are mentioned in it, could\r\nnot have originated in the fifteenth century, to which Perotti’s\r\naccount refers; for that author speaks of it as a well known malady,\r\nand states that the omission to notice it by older writers, was to be\r\nascribed solely to the want of education in Apulia, the only province\r\nprobably where the disease at that time prevailed. A nervous disorder\r\nthat had arrived at so high a degree of development, must have been\r\nlong in existence, and doubtless had required an elaborate preparation\r\nby the concurrence of general causes.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms which followed the bite of venomous spiders were well\r\nknown to the ancients, and had excited the attention of their best\r\nobservers, who agree in their descriptions of them. It is probable\r\nthat among the numerous species of their phalangium[257], the Apulian\r\ntarantula is included, but it is difficult to determine this point with\r\ncertainty, more especially, because in Italy the tarantula was not the\r\nonly insect which caused this nervous affection, similar results being\r\nlikewise attributed to the bite of the scorpion. Lividity of the whole\r\nbody as well as of the countenance, difficulty of speech, tremor of\r\nthe limbs, icy coldness, pale urine, depression of spirits, headache,\r\na flow of tears, nausea, vomiting, sexual excitement, flatulence,\r\nsyncope, dysuria, watchfulness, lethargy, even death itself, were cited\r\nby them as the consequences of being bitten by venomous spiders, and\r\nthey made little distinction as to their kinds. To these symptoms we\r\nmay add the strange rumour, repeated throughout the middle ages, that\r\npersons who were bitten, ejected by the bowels and kidneys, and even by\r\nvomiting, substances resembling a spider’s web.\r\n\r\nNowhere, however, do we find any mention made that those affected felt\r\nan irresistible propensity to dancing, or that they were accidentally\r\ncured by it. Even Constantine of Africa, who lived 500 years after\r\nAëtius, and as the most learned physician of the school of Salerno,\r\nwould certainly not have passed over so acceptable a subject of\r\nremark, knows nothing of such a memorable course of this disease\r\narising from poison, and merely repeats the observations of his\r\nGreek predecessors[258]. Gariopontus[259], a Salernian physician of\r\nthe eleventh century, was the first to describe a kind of insanity,\r\nthe remote affinity of which to the tarantula disease is rendered\r\napparent by a very striking symptom. The patients in their sudden\r\nattacks behaved like maniacs, sprang up, throwing their arms about\r\nwith wild movements, and, if perchance a sword was at hand, they\r\nwounded themselves and others, so that it became necessary carefully\r\nto secure them. They imagined that they heard voices, and various\r\nkinds of sounds, and if, during this state of illusion, the tones of\r\na favourite instrument happened to catch their ear, they commenced a\r\nspasmodic dance, or ran with the utmost energy which they could muster\r\nuntil they were totally exhausted. These dangerous maniacs, who, it\r\nwould seem, appeared in considerable numbers, were looked upon as a\r\nlegion of devils, but on the causes of their malady this obscure writer\r\nadds nothing further than that he believes (oddly enough) that it may\r\nsometimes be excited by the bite of a mad dog. He calls the disease\r\nAnteneasmus, by which is meant no doubt the Enthusiasmus of the Greek\r\nphysicians[260]. We cite this phenomenon as an important forerunner\r\nof Tarantism, under the conviction that we have thus added to the\r\nevidence that the development of this latter must have been founded\r\non circumstances which existed from the twelfth to the end of the\r\nfourteenth century; for the origin of Tarantism itself is referrible,\r\nwith the utmost probability, to a period between the middle and the\r\nend of this century, and is consequently contemporaneous with that of\r\nthe St. Vitus’s dance (1374). The influence of the Roman Catholic\r\nreligion, connected as this was, in the middle ages, with the pomp of\r\nprocessions, with public exercises of penance, and with innumerable\r\npractices which strongly excited the imaginations of its votaries,\r\ncertainly brought the mind to a very favourable state for the reception\r\nof a nervous disorder. Accordingly, so long as the doctrines of\r\nChristianity were blended with so much mysticism, these unhallowed\r\ndisorders prevailed to an important extent, and even in our own days\r\nwe find them propagated with the greatest facility where the existence\r\nof superstition produces the same effect in more limited districts, as\r\nit once did among whole nations. But this is not all. Every country in\r\nEurope, and Italy perhaps more than any other, was visited during the\r\nmiddle ages by frightful plagues, which followed each other in such\r\nquick succession, that they gave the exhausted people scarcely any\r\ntime for recovery. The oriental bubo-plague ravaged Italy[261] sixteen\r\ntimes between the years 1119 and 1340. Small-pox and measles were still\r\nmore destructive than in modern times, and recurred as frequently. St.\r\nAnthony’s fire was the dread of town and country; and that disgusting\r\ndisease, the leprosy, which, in consequence of the crusades, spread\r\nits insinuating poison in all directions, snatched from the paternal\r\nhearth innumerable victims who, banished from human society, pined away\r\nin lonely huts, whither they were accompanied only by the pity of the\r\nbenevolent and their own despair. All these calamities, of which the\r\nmoderns have scarcely retained any recollection, were heightened to\r\nan incredible degree by the Black Death[262], which spread boundless\r\ndevastation and misery over Italy. Men’s minds were everywhere morbidly\r\nsensitive; and as it happens with individuals whose senses, when they\r\nare suffering under anxiety, become more irritable, so that trifles are\r\nmagnified into objects of great alarm, and slight shocks, which would\r\nscarcely affect the spirits when in health, give rise in them to severe\r\ndiseases, so was it with this whole nation, at all times so alive to\r\nemotions, and at that period so sorely pressed with the horrors of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe bite of venomous spiders, or rather the unreasonable fear of its\r\nconsequences, excited at such a juncture, though it could not have\r\ndone so at an earlier period, a violent nervous disorder, which,\r\nlike St. Vitus’s dance in Germany, spread by sympathy, increasing\r\nin severity as it took a wider range, and still further extending\r\nits ravages from its long continuance. Thus, from the middle of the\r\nfourteenth century, the furies of _the Dance_ brandished their scourge\r\nover afflicted mortals; and music, for which the inhabitants of Italy,\r\nnow probably for the first time, manifested susceptibility and talent,\r\nbecame capable of exciting ecstatic attacks in those affected, and then\r\nfurnished the magical means of exorcising their melancholy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECT. 3.—INCREASE.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the fifteenth century we find that Tarantism had\r\nspread beyond the boundaries of Apulia, and that the fear of being\r\nbitten by venomous spiders had increased. Nothing short of death\r\nitself was expected from the wound which these insects inflicted, and\r\nif those who were bitten escaped with their lives, they were said to\r\nbe seen pining away in a desponding state of lassitude. Many became\r\nweak-sighted or hard of hearing, some lost the power of speech, and\r\nall were insensible to ordinary causes of excitement. Nothing but\r\nthe flute or the cithern afforded them relief[263]. At the sound of\r\nthese instruments they awoke as it were by enchantment, opened their\r\neyes, and moving slowly at first, according to the measure of the\r\nmusic, were, as the time quickened, gradually hurried on to the most\r\npassionate dance. It was generally observable that country people,\r\nwho were rude, and ignorant of music, evinced on these occasions an\r\nunusual degree of grace, as if they had been well practised in elegant\r\nmovements of the body; for it is a peculiarity in nervous disorders\r\nof this kind, that the organs of motion are in an altered condition,\r\nand are completely under the control of the over-strained spirits.\r\nCities and villages alike resounded throughout the summer season with\r\nthe notes of fifes, clarinets, and Turkish drums; and patients were\r\neverywhere to be met with who looked to dancing as their only remedy.\r\nAlexander ab Alexandro[264], who gives this account, saw a young man in\r\na remote village who was seized with a violent attack of Tarantism. He\r\nlistened with eagerness and a fixed stare to the sound of a drum, and\r\nhis graceful movements gradually became more and more violent, until\r\nhis dancing was converted into a succession of frantic leaps, which\r\nrequired the utmost exertion of his whole strength. In the midst of\r\nthis over-strained exertion of mind and body the music suddenly ceased,\r\nand he immediately fell powerless to the ground, where he lay senseless\r\nand motionless until its magical effect again aroused him to a renewal\r\nof his impassioned performances.\r\n\r\nAt the period of which we are treating there was a general conviction,\r\nthat by music and dancing the poison of the Tarantula was distributed\r\nover the whole body, and expelled through the skin, but that if there\r\nremained the slightest vestige of it in the vessels, this became a\r\npermanent germ of the disorder, so that the dancing fits might again\r\nand again be excited _ad infinitum_ by music. This belief, which\r\nresembled the delusion of those insane persons who, being by artful\r\nmanagement freed from the imagined causes of their sufferings, are but\r\nfor a short time released from their false notions, was attended with\r\nthe most injurious effects: for in consequence of it those affected\r\nnecessarily became by degrees convinced of the incurable nature of\r\ntheir disorder. They expected relief, indeed, but not a cure, from\r\nmusic; and when the heat of summer awakened a recollection of the\r\ndances of the preceding year, they, like the St. Vitus’s dancers\r\nof the same period before St. Vitus’s day, again grew dejected\r\nand misanthropic, until, by music and dancing, they dispelled the\r\nmelancholy which had become with them a kind of sensual enjoyment.\r\n\r\nUnder such favourable circumstances it is clear that Tarantism must\r\nevery year have made further progress. The number of those affected by\r\nit increased beyond all belief, for whoever had either actually been,\r\nor even fancied that he had been, once bitten by a poisonous spider or\r\nscorpion, made his appearance annually wherever the merry notes of the\r\nTarantella resounded. Inquisitive females joined the throng and caught\r\nthe disease, not indeed from the poison of the spider, but from the\r\nmental poison which they eagerly received through the eye; and thus\r\nthe cure of the _Tarantati_ gradually became established as a regular\r\nfestival of the populace, which was anticipated with impatient delight.\r\n\r\nWithout attributing more to deception and fraud than to the peculiar\r\nnature of a progressive mental malady, it may readily be conceived\r\nthat the cases of this strange disorder now grew more frequent.\r\nThe celebrated Matthioli[265], who is worthy of entire confidence,\r\ngives his account as an eye-witness. He saw the same extraordinary\r\neffects produced by music as Alexandro, for, however tortured with\r\npain, however hopeless of relief the patients appeared, as they lay\r\nstretched on the couch of sickness, at the very first sounds of those\r\nmelodies which made an impression on them—but this was the case only\r\nwith the Tarantellas composed expressly for the purpose—they sprang\r\nup as if inspired with new life and spirit, and, unmindful of their\r\ndisorder, began to move in measured gestures, dancing for hours\r\ntogether without fatigue, until, covered with a kindly perspiration,\r\nthey felt a salutary degree of lassitude, which relieved them for a\r\ntime at least, perhaps even for a whole year, from their dejection and\r\noppressive feeling of general indisposition. Alexandro’s experience of\r\nthe injurious effects resulting from a sudden cessation of the music\r\nwas generally confirmed by Matthioli. If the clarinets and drums ceased\r\nfor a single moment, which, as the most skilful players were tired out\r\nby the patients, could not but happen occasionally, they suffered their\r\nlimbs to fall listless, again sank exhausted to the ground, and could\r\nfind no solace but in a renewal of the dance. On this account care was\r\ntaken to continue the music until exhaustion was produced; for it was\r\nbetter to pay a few extra musicians, who might relieve each other,\r\nthan to permit the patient, in the midst of this curative exercise, to\r\nrelapse into so deplorable a state of suffering. The attack consequent\r\nupon the bite of the Tarantula, Matthioli describes as varying much in\r\nits manner. Some became morbidly exhilarated, so that they remained\r\nfor a long while without sleep, laughing, dancing, and singing in a\r\nstate of the greatest excitement. Others, on the contrary, were drowsy.\r\nThe generality felt nausea and suffered from vomiting, and some had\r\nconstant tremors. Complete mania was no uncommon occurrence, not to\r\nmention the usual dejection of spirits and other subordinate symptoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SECT. 4.—IDIOSYNCRACIES.—MUSIC.\r\n\r\nUnaccountable emotions, strange desires and morbid sensual irritations\r\nof all kinds, were as prevalent as in the St. Vitus’s dance and similar\r\ngreat nervous maladies. So late as the sixteenth century patients\r\nwere seen armed with glittering swords which, during the attack, they\r\nbrandished with wild gestures, as if they were going to engage in a\r\nfencing match[266]. Even women scorned all female delicacy[267] and,\r\nadopting this impassioned demeanour, did the same; and this phenomenon,\r\nas well as the excitement which the Tarantula dancers felt at the sight\r\nof any thing with metallic lustre, was quite common up to the period\r\nwhen, in modern times, the disease disappeared[268].\r\n\r\nThe abhorrence of certain colours and the agreeable sensations produced\r\nby others, were much more marked among the excitable Italians than was\r\nthe case in the St. Vitus’s dance with the more phlegmatic Germans.\r\nRed colours, which the St. Vitus’s dancers detested, they generally\r\nliked, so that a patient was seldom seen who did not carry a red\r\nhandkerchief for his gratification, or greedily feast his eyes on\r\nany articles of red clothing worn by the bystanders. Some preferred\r\nyellow, others black colours, of which an explanation was sought,\r\naccording to the prevailing notions of the times, in the difference\r\nof temperaments[269]. Others again were enraptured with green; and\r\neye-witnesses describe this rage for colours as so extraordinary, that\r\nthey can scarcely find words with which to express their astonishment.\r\nNo sooner did the patients obtain a sight of the favourite colour\r\nthan, new as the impression was, they rushed like infuriated animals\r\ntowards the object, devoured it with their eager looks, kissed and\r\ncaressed it in every possible way, and gradually resigning themselves\r\nto softer sensations, adopted the languishing expression of enamoured\r\nlovers, and embraced the handkerchief, or whatever other article it\r\nmight be, which was presented to them, with the most intense ardour,\r\nwhile the tears streamed from their eyes as if they were completely\r\noverwhelmed by the inebriating impression on their senses.\r\n\r\nThe dancing fits of a certain Capuchin friar in Tarentum excited so\r\nmuch curiosity, that Cardinal Cajetano proceeded to the monastery,\r\nthat he might see with his own eyes what was going on. As soon as the\r\nmonk, who was in the midst of his dance, perceived the spiritual prince\r\nclothed in his red garments, he no longer listened to the Tarantella\r\nof the musicians, but with strange gestures endeavoured to approach\r\nthe Cardinal, as if he wished to count the very threads of his scarlet\r\nrobe, and to allay his intense longing by its odour. The interference\r\nof the spectators, and his own respect, prevented his touching it, and\r\nthus the irritation of his senses not being appeased, he fell into a\r\nstate of such anguish and disquietude, that he presently sank down in a\r\nswoon, from which he did not recover until the Cardinal compassionately\r\ngave him his cape. This he immediately seized in the greatest ecstacy,\r\nand pressed now to his breast, now to his forehead and cheeks, and then\r\nagain commenced his dance as if in the frenzy of a love fit[270].\r\n\r\nAt the sight of colours which they disliked, patients flew into the\r\nmost violent rage, and, like the St. Vitus’s dancers when they saw red\r\nobjects, could scarcely be restrained from tearing the clothes of those\r\nspectators who raised in them such disagreeable sensations[271].\r\n\r\nAnother no less extraordinary symptom was the ardent longing for the\r\nsea which the patients evinced. As the St. John’s dancers of the\r\nfourteenth century saw, in the spirit, the heavens open and display\r\nall the splendour of the saints, so did those who were suffering under\r\nthe bite of the Tarantula feel themselves attracted to the boundless\r\nexpanse of the blue ocean, and lost themselves in its contemplation.\r\nSome songs, which are still preserved, marked this peculiar longing,\r\nwhich was moreover expressed by significant music, and was excited even\r\nby the bare mention of the sea[272]. Some, in whom this susceptibility\r\nwas carried to the greatest pitch, cast themselves with blind fury into\r\nthe blue waves[273], as the St. Vitus’s dancers occasionally did into\r\nrapid rivers. This condition, so opposite to the frightful state of\r\nhydrophobia, betrayed itself in others only in the pleasure afforded\r\nthem by the sight of clear water in glasses. These they bore in their\r\nhands while dancing, exhibiting at the same time strange movements,\r\nand giving way to the most extravagant expressions of their feelings.\r\nThey were delighted also when, in the midst of the space allotted for\r\nthis exercise, more ample vessels, filled with water, and surrounded by\r\nrushes and water plants, were placed, in which they bathed their heads\r\nand arms with evident pleasure[274]. Others there were who rolled about\r\non the ground, and were, by their own desire, buried up to the neck in\r\nthe earth, in order to alleviate the misery of their condition, not to\r\nmention an endless variety of other symptoms which showed the perverted\r\naction of the nerves.\r\n\r\nAll these modes of relief, however, were as nothing in comparison with\r\nthe irresistible charms of musical sound. Attempts had indeed been\r\nmade in ancient times to mitigate the pain of sciatica[275], or the\r\nparoxysms of mania[276], by the soft melody of the flute, and, what\r\nis still more applicable to the present purpose, to remove the danger\r\narising from the bite of vipers[277] by the same means. This, however,\r\nwas tried only to a very small extent. But after being bitten by the\r\nTarantula, there was, according to popular opinion, no way of saving\r\nlife except by music, and it was hardly considered as an exception\r\nto the general rule, that every now and then the bad effects of a\r\nwound were prevented by placing a ligature on the bitten limb, or\r\nby internal medicine, or that strong persons occasionally withstood\r\nthe effects of the poison, without the employment of any remedies at\r\nall[278]. It was much more common, and is quite in accordance with the\r\nnature of so exquisite a nervous disease, to hear accounts of many,\r\nwho, when bitten by the Tarantula, perished miserably because the\r\nTarantella, which would have afforded them deliverance, was not played\r\nto them[279]. It was customary, therefore, so early as the commencement\r\nof the seventeenth century, for whole bands of musicians to traverse\r\nItaly during the summer months, and, what is quite unexampled either in\r\nancient or modern times, the cure of the _Tarantati_ in the different\r\ntowns and villages was undertaken on a grand scale. This season of\r\ndancing and music was called “the women’s little carnival,”[280] for\r\nit was women more especially who conducted the arrangements; so that\r\nthroughout the whole country they saved up their spare money, for the\r\npurpose of rewarding the welcome musicians, and many of them neglected\r\ntheir household employments to participate in this festival of the\r\nsick. Mention is even made of one benevolent lady (Mita Lupa) who had\r\nexpended her whole fortune on this object[281].\r\n\r\nThe music itself was of a kind perfectly adapted to the nature of\r\nthe malady, and it made so deep an impression on the Italians, that\r\neven to the present time, long since the extinction of the disorder,\r\nthey have retained the Tarantella, as a particular species of music\r\nemployed for quick lively dancing. The different kinds of Tarantella\r\nwere distinguished, very significantly, by particular names, which had\r\nreference to the moods observed in the patients. Whence it appears that\r\nthey aimed at representing by these tunes, even the idiosyncracies of\r\nthe mind as expressed in the countenance. Thus there was one kind of\r\nTarantella which was called “Panno rosso,” a very lively impassioned\r\nstyle of music, to which wild dithyrambic songs were adapted; another,\r\ncalled “Panno verde,” which was suited to the milder excitement of the\r\nsenses, caused by green colours, and set to Idyllian songs of verdant\r\nfields and shady groves. A third was named “Cinque tempi:” a fourth\r\n“Moresca,” which was played to a Moorish dance; a fifth, “Catena”\r\nand a sixth, with a very appropriate designation, “Spallata,” as if it\r\nwere only fit to be played to dancers who were lame in the shoulder.\r\nThis was the slowest and least in vogue of all[282]. For those who\r\nloved water they took care to select love songs, which were sung to\r\ncorresponding music, and such persons delighted in hearing of gushing\r\nsprings and rushing cascades and streams[283]. It is to be regretted\r\nthat on this subject we are unable to give any further information, for\r\nonly small fragments of songs, and a very few Tarantellas, have been\r\npreserved, which belong to a period so remote as the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth, or at furthest the end of the sixteenth century[284].\r\n\r\nThe music was almost wholly in the Turkish style (aria Turchesca),\r\nand the ancient songs of the peasantry of Apulia, which increased in\r\nnumber annually, were well suited to the abrupt and lively notes of\r\nthe Turkish drum and the shepherd’s pipe. These two instruments were\r\nthe favourites in the country, but others of all kinds were played in\r\ntowns and villages, as an accompaniment to the dances of the patients\r\nand the songs of the spectators. If any particular melody was disliked\r\nby those affected, they indicated their displeasure by violent gestures\r\nexpressive of aversion. They could not endure false notes, and it\r\nis remarkable that uneducated boors, who had never in their lives\r\nmanifested any perception of the enchanting power of harmony, acquired,\r\nin this respect, an extremely refined sense of hearing, as if they had\r\nbeen initiated into the profoundest secrets of the musical art[285].\r\nIt was a matter of every day’s experience, that patients showed a\r\npredilection for certain Tarantellas, in preference to others, which\r\ngave rise to the composition of a great variety of these dances. They\r\nwere likewise very capricious in their partialities for particular\r\ninstruments; so that some longed for the shrill notes of the trumpet,\r\nothers for the softest music produced by the vibration of strings[286].\r\n\r\nTarantism was at its greatest height in Italy in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, long after the St. Vitus’s Dance of Germany had disappeared.\r\nIt was not the natives of the country only who were attacked by this\r\ncomplaint. Foreigners of every colour and of every race, negroes,\r\ngipsies, Spaniards, Albanians, were in like manner affected by it[287].\r\nAgainst the effects produced by the Tarantula’s bite, or by the sight\r\nof the sufferers, neither youth nor age afforded any protection; so\r\nthat even old men of ninety threw aside their crutches at the sound of\r\nthe Tarantella, and, as if some magic potion, restorative of youth and\r\nvigour, were flowing through their veins, joined the most extravagant\r\ndancers[288]. Ferdinando saw a boy five years old seized with the\r\ndancing mania[289], in consequence of the bite of a tarantula, and,\r\nwhat is almost past belief, were it not supported by the testimony of\r\nso credible an eye-witness, even deaf people were not exempt from this\r\ndisorder, so potent in its effect was the very sight of those affected,\r\neven without the exhilarating emotions caused by music[290].\r\n\r\nSubordinate nervous attacks were much more frequent during this\r\ncentury than at any former period, and an extraordinary icy coldness\r\nwas observed in those who were the subjects of them; so that they\r\ndid not recover their natural heat until they had engaged in violent\r\ndancing[291]. Their anguish and sense of oppression forced from them\r\na cold perspiration; the secretion from the kidneys was pale[292],\r\nand they had so great a dislike to every thing cold, that when water\r\nwas offered them they pushed it away with abhorrence. Wine, on the\r\ncontrary, they all drank willingly, without being heated by it, or\r\nin the slightest degree intoxicated[293]. During the whole period\r\nof the attack they suffered from spasms in the stomach, and felt a\r\ndisinclination to take food of any kind. They used to abstain some time\r\nbefore the expected seizures from meat and from snails, which they\r\nthought rendered them more severe[294], and their great thirst for wine\r\nmay, therefore, in some measure, be attributable to the want of a more\r\nnutritious diet; yet the disorder of the nerves was evidently its chief\r\ncause, and the loss of appetite, as well as the necessity for support\r\nby wine, were its effects. Loss of voice, occasional blindness[295],\r\nvertigo, complete insanity, with sleeplessness, frequent weeping\r\nwithout any ostensible cause, were all usual symptoms. Many patients\r\nfound relief from being placed in swings or rocked in cradles[296];\r\nothers required to be roused from their state of suffering by severe\r\nblows on the soles of their feet; others beat themselves, without any\r\nintention of making a display, but solely for the purpose of allaying\r\nthe intense nervous irritation which they felt; and a considerable\r\nnumber were seen with their bellies swollen[297], like those of the\r\nSt. John’s dancers, while the violence of the intestinal disorder\r\nwas indicated in others by obstinate constipation or diarrhœa and\r\nvomiting[298]. These pitiable objects gradually lost their strength\r\nand their colour, and creeping about with injected eyes, jaundiced\r\ncomplexions, and inflated bowels, soon fell into a state of profound\r\nmelancholy, which found food and solace in the solemn tolling of the\r\nfuneral bell, and in an abode among the tombs of cemeteries, as is\r\nrelated of the Lycanthropes of former times.\r\n\r\nThe persuasion of the inevitable consequences of being bitten by\r\nthe Tarantula, exercised a dominion over men’s minds which even the\r\nhealthiest and strongest could not shake off. So late as the middle\r\nof the sixteenth century, the celebrated Fracastoro found the robust\r\nbailiff of his landed estate groaning, and, with the aspect of a person\r\nin the extremity of despair, suffering the very agonies of death,\r\nfrom a sting in the neck, inflicted by an insect which was believed\r\nto be a Tarantula. He kindly administered without delay, a potion of\r\nvinegar and Armenian bole, the great remedy of those days for the\r\nplague and all kinds of animal poisons, and the dying man was, as if by\r\na miracle, restored to life and the power of speech[299]. Now, since\r\nit is quite out of the question that the bole could have any thing to\r\ndo with the result in this case, notwithstanding Fracastoro’s belief\r\nin its virtues, we can only account for the cure by supposing, that a\r\nconfidence in so great a physician prevailed over this fatal disease\r\nof the imagination, which would otherwise have yielded to scarcely any\r\nother remedy except the Tarantella. Ferdinando was acquainted with\r\nwomen who, for thirty years in succession, had overcome the attacks\r\nof this disorder by a renewal of their annual dance—so long did they\r\nmaintain their belief in the yet undestroyed poison of the Tarantula’s\r\nbite, and so long did that mental affection continue to exist, after it\r\nhad ceased to depend on any corporeal excitement[300].\r\n\r\nWherever we turn we find that this morbid state of mind prevailed, and\r\nwas so supported by the opinions of the age, that it needed only a\r\nstimulus in the bite of the Tarantula, and the supposed certainty of\r\nits very disastrous consequences, to originate this violent nervous\r\ndisorder. Even in Ferdinando’s time there were many who altogether\r\ndenied the poisonous effects of the Tarantula’s bite, whilst they\r\nconsidered the disorder, which annually set Italy in commotion, to be\r\na melancholy depending on the imagination[301]. They dearly expiated\r\nthis scepticism, however, when they were led, with an inconsiderate\r\nhardihood, to test their opinions by experiment; for many of them\r\nbecame the subjects of severe Tarantism, and even a distinguished\r\nprelate, Jo. Baptist Quinzato, Bishop of Foligno, having allowed\r\nhimself, by way of a joke, to be bitten by a Tarantula, could obtain\r\na cure in no other way than by being, through the influence of the\r\nTarentella, compelled to dance[302]. Others among the clergy, who\r\nwished to shut their ears against music, because they considered\r\ndancing derogatory to their station, fell into a dangerous state of\r\nillness by thus delaying the crisis of the malady, and were obliged at\r\nlast to save themselves from a miserable death by submitting to the\r\nunwelcome but sole means of cure[303]. Thus it appears that the age was\r\nso little favourable to freedom of thought, that even the most decided\r\nsceptics, incapable of guarding themselves against the recollection\r\nof what had been presented to the eye, were subdued by a poison, the\r\npowers of which they had ridiculed, and which was in itself inert in\r\nits effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECT. 5.—HYSTERIA.\r\n\r\nDifferent characteristics of morbidly excited vitality having been\r\nrendered prominent by Tarantism in different individuals, it could\r\nnot but happen that other derangements of the nerves would assume the\r\nform of this, whenever circumstances favoured such a transition.\r\nThis was more especially the case with hysteria, that proteiform and\r\nmutable disorder, in which the imaginations, the superstitions and the\r\nfollies of all ages have been evidently reflected. The “Carnevaletto\r\ndelle Donne” appeared most opportunely for those who were hysterical.\r\nTheir disease received from it, as it had at other times from other\r\nextraordinary customs, a peculiar direction; so that whether bitten\r\nby the tarantula or not, they felt compelled to participate in the\r\ndances of those affected, and to make their appearance at this\r\npopular festival, where they had an opportunity of triumphantly\r\nexhibiting their sufferings. Let us here pause to consider the kind\r\nof life which the women in Italy led. Lonely, and deprived by cruel\r\ncustom of social intercourse, that fairest of all enjoyments, they\r\ndragged on a miserable existence. Cheerfulness and an inclination\r\nto sensual pleasures passed into compulsory idleness, and, in many,\r\ninto black despondency[304]. Their imaginations became disordered—a\r\npallid countenance and oppressed respiration bore testimony to their\r\nprofound sufferings. How could they do otherwise, sunk as they were\r\nin such extreme misery, than seize the occasion to burst forth from\r\ntheir prisons, and alleviate their miseries by taking part in the\r\ndelights of music. Nor should we here pass unnoticed a circumstance\r\nwhich illustrates, in a remarkable degree, the psychological nature\r\nof hysterical sufferings, namely, that many chlorotic females, by\r\njoining the dancers at the Carnevaletto, were freed from their spasms\r\nand oppression of breathing for the whole year, although the corporeal\r\ncause of their malady was not removed[305]. After such a result, no one\r\ncould call their self-deception a mere imposture, and unconditionally\r\ncondemn it as such.\r\n\r\nThis numerous class of patients certainly contributed not a little to\r\nthe maintenance of the evil, for their fantastic sufferings, in which\r\ndissimulation and reality could scarcely be distinguished even by\r\nthemselves, much less by their physicians, were imitated, in the same\r\nway as the distortions of the St. Vitus’s dancers, by the impostors of\r\nthat period. It was certainly by these persons also that the number\r\nof subordinate symptoms was increased to an endless extent, as may\r\nbe conceived from the daily observation of hysterical patients, who,\r\nfrom a morbid desire to render themselves remarkable, deviate from the\r\nlaws of moral propriety. Powerful sexual excitement had often the most\r\ndecided influence over their condition. Many of them exposed themselves\r\nin the most indecent manner, tore their hair out by the roots, with\r\nhowling and gnashing of their teeth; and when, as was sometimes the\r\ncase, their unsatisfied passion hurried them on to a state of frenzy,\r\nthey closed their existence by self-destruction; it being common at\r\nthat time for these unfortunate beings to precipitate themselves into\r\nthe wells[306].\r\n\r\nIt might hence seem that, owing to the conduct of patients of this\r\ndescription, so much of fraud and falsehood would be mixed up with the\r\noriginal disorder, that having passed into another complaint, it must\r\nhave been itself destroyed. This, however, did not happen in the first\r\nhalf of the seventeenth century; for as a clear proof that Tarantism\r\nremained substantially the same and quite unaffected by Hysteria,\r\nthere were in many places, and in particular at Messapia, fewer women\r\naffected than men, who in their turn were, in no small proportion, led\r\ninto temptation by sexual excitement[307]. In other places, as for\r\nexample at Brindisi, the case was reversed, which may, as in other\r\ncomplaints, be in some measure attributable to local causes. Upon the\r\nwhole it appears, from concurrent accounts, that women by no means\r\nenjoyed the distinction of being attacked by Tarantism more frequently\r\nthan men.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the cicatrix of the tarantula bite, on the yearly or\r\nhalf-yearly return of the fit, became discoloured[308], but on this\r\npoint the distinct testimony of good observers is wanting to deprive\r\nthe assertion of its utter improbability.\r\n\r\nIt is not out of place to remark here, that about the same time that\r\nTarantism attained its greatest height in Italy, the bite of venomous\r\nspiders was more feared in distant parts of Asia likewise, than it\r\nhad ever been within the memory of man. There was this difference,\r\nhowever, that the symptoms supervening on the occurrence of this\r\naccident were not accompanied by the Apulian nervous disorder, which,\r\nas has been shown in the foregoing pages, had its origin rather in the\r\nmelancholic temperament of the inhabitants of the south of Italy, than\r\nin the nature of the tarantula poison itself. This poison is therefore\r\ndoubtless to be considered only as a remote cause of the complaint,\r\nwhich, but for that temperament, would be inadequate to its production.\r\nThe Persians employed a very rough means of counteracting the bad\r\nconsequences of a poison of this sort. They drenched the wounded person\r\nwith milk, and then, by violent rotatory motion in a suspended box,\r\ncompelled him to vomit[309].\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECT. 6.—DECREASE.\r\n\r\nThe Dancing Mania, arising from the tarantula bite, continued, with all\r\nthose additions of self-deception, and of the dissimulation which is\r\nsuch a constant attendant on nervous disorders of this kind, through\r\nthe whole course of the seventeenth century. It was indeed gradually\r\non the decline, but up to the termination of this period, showed such\r\nextraordinary symptoms, that Baglivi, one of the best physicians of\r\nthat time, thought he did a service to science by making them the\r\nsubject of a dissertation[310]. He repeats all the observations of\r\nFerdinando, and supports his own assertions by the experience of his\r\nfather, a physician at Lecce, whose testimony, as an eye-witness, may\r\nbe admitted as unexceptionable[311].\r\n\r\nThe immediate consequences of the tarantula bite, the supervening\r\nnervous disorder, and the aberrations and fits of those who suffered\r\nfrom Hysteria, he describes in a masterly style, nor does he ever\r\nsuffer his credulity to diminish the authenticity of his account, of\r\nwhich he has been unjustly accused by later writers.\r\n\r\nFinally, Tarantism has declined more and more in modern times, and is\r\nnow limited to single cases. How could it possibly have maintained\r\nitself unchanged in the eighteenth century, when all the links which\r\nconnected it with the middle ages had long since been snapped asunder?\r\nImposture[312] grew more frequent, and wherever the disease still\r\nappeared in its genuine form, its chief cause, namely, a peculiar cast\r\nof melancholy, which formerly had been the temperament of thousands,\r\nwas now possessed only occasionally by unfortunate individuals. It\r\nmight therefore not unreasonably be maintained, that the Tarantism of\r\nmodern times bears nearly the same relation to the original malady, as\r\nthe St. Vitus’s dance which still exists, and certainly has all along\r\nexisted, bears, in certain cases, to the original dancing mania of the\r\ndancers of St. John.\r\n\r\nTo conclude. Tarantism, as a real disease, has been denied _in toto_,\r\nand stigmatized as an imposition, by most physicians and naturalists,\r\nwho in this controversy have shown the narrowness of their views and\r\ntheir utter ignorance of history. In order to support their opinion\r\nthey have instituted some experiments, apparently favourable to it,\r\nbut under circumstances altogether inapplicable, since, for the most\r\npart, they selected, as the subjects of them, none but healthy men,\r\nwho were totally uninfluenced by a belief in this once so dreaded\r\ndisease. From individual instances of fraud and dissimulation, such as\r\nare found in connexion with most nervous affections without rendering\r\ntheir reality a matter of any doubt, they drew a too hasty conclusion\r\nrespecting the general phenomenon, of which they appeared not to know,\r\nthat it had continued for nearly four hundred years, having originated\r\nin the remotest periods of the middle ages. The most learned and the\r\nmost acute among these sceptics is Serao the Neapolitan[313]. His\r\nreasonings amount to this, that he considers the disease to be a very\r\nmarked form of melancholia, and compares the effect of the tarantula\r\nbite upon it to stimulating, with spurs, a horse which is already\r\nrunning. The reality of that effect he thus admits, and therefore\r\ndirectly confirms what in appearance only he denies[314]. By shaking\r\nthe already vacillating belief in this disorder he is said to have\r\nactually succeeded in rendering it less frequent, and in setting bounds\r\nto imposture[315]; but this no more disproves the reality of its\r\nexistence, than the oft-repeated detection of imposition has been able,\r\nin modern times, to banish magnetic sleep from the circle of natural\r\nphenomena, though such detection has, on its side, rendered more rare\r\nthe incontestible effects of animal magnetism. Other physicians and\r\nnaturalists[316] have delivered their sentiments on Tarantism, but as\r\nthey have not possessed an enlarged knowledge of its history, their\r\nviews do not merit particular exposition. It is sufficient for the\r\ncomprehension of every one, that we have presented the facts freed from\r\nall extraneous speculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                      DANCING MANIA IN ABYSSINIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECT. 1.—TIGRETIER.\r\n\r\nBoth the St. Vitus’s dance and Tarantism belonged to the ages in which\r\nthey appeared. They could not have existed under the same latitude at\r\nany other epoch, for at no other period were the circumstances which\r\nprepared the way for them combined in a similar relation to each other,\r\nand the mental as well as corporeal temperaments of nations, which\r\ndepend on causes such as have been stated, are as little capable of\r\nrenewal as the different stages of life in individuals. This gives\r\nso much the more importance to a disease but cursorily alluded to\r\nin the foregoing pages, which exists in Abyssinia, and which nearly\r\nresembles the original mania of the St. John’s dancers, inasmuch as it\r\nexhibits a perfectly similar ecstacy, with the same violent effect on\r\nthe nerves of motion. It occurs most frequently in the Tigrè country,\r\nbeing thence called Tigretier, and is probably the same malady which is\r\ncalled in the Æthiopian language Astarāgaza[317]. On this subject we\r\nwill introduce the testimony of Nathaniel Pearce[318], an eye-witness,\r\nwho resided nine years in Abyssinia. “The Tigretier,” says he, “is\r\nmore common among the women than among the men. It seizes the body as\r\nif with a violent fever, and from that turns to a lingering sickness,\r\nwhich reduces the patients to skeletons, and often kills them, if the\r\nrelations cannot procure the proper remedy. During this sickness their\r\nspeech is changed to a kind of stuttering, which no one can understand\r\nbut those afflicted with the same disorder. When the relations find\r\nthe malady to be the real _tigretier_, they join together to defray\r\nthe expenses of curing it; the first remedy they in general attempt,\r\nis to procure the assistance of a learned Dofter, who reads the Gospel\r\nof St. John[319], and drenches the patient with cold water daily for\r\nthe space of seven days—an application that very often proves fatal.\r\nThe most effectual cure, though far more expensive than the former, is\r\nas follows:—The relations hire, for a certain sum of money, a band of\r\ntrumpeters, drummers and fifers, and buy a quantity of liquor; then all\r\nthe young men and women of the place assemble at the patient’s house,\r\nto perform the following most extraordinary ceremony.\r\n\r\n“I was once called in by a neighbour to see his wife, a very young\r\nwoman, who had the misfortune to be afflicted with this disorder; and\r\nthe man being an old acquaintance of mine, and always a close comrade\r\nin the camp, I went every day when at home to see her, but I could not\r\nbe of any service to her, though she never refused my medicines. At\r\nthis time, I could not understand a word she said, although she talked\r\nvery freely, nor could any of her relations understand her. She could\r\nnot bear the sight of a book or a priest, for at the sight of either,\r\nshe struggled, and was apparently seized with acute agony, and a flood\r\nof tears, like blood mingled with water, would pour down her face from\r\nher eyes. She had lain three months in this lingering state, living\r\nupon so little that it seemed not enough to keep a human body alive;\r\nat last, her husband agreed to employ the usual remedy, and, after\r\npreparing for the maintenance of the band, during the time it would\r\ntake to effect the cure, he borrowed from all his neighbours their\r\nsilver ornaments, and loaded her legs, arms, and neck with them.\r\n\r\n“The evening that the band began to play, I seated myself close by\r\nher side as she lay upon the couch, and about two minutes after the\r\ntrumpets had begun to sound, I observed her shoulders begin to move,\r\nand soon afterwards her head and breast, and in less than a quarter\r\nof an hour, she sat upon her couch. The wild look she had, though\r\nsometimes she smiled, made me draw off to a greater distance, being\r\nalmost alarmed to see one nearly a skeleton move with such strength:\r\nher head, neck, shoulders, hands and feet, all made a strong motion\r\nto the sound of the music, and in this manner she went on by degrees,\r\nuntil she stood up on her legs upon the floor. Afterwards she began to\r\ndance, and at times to jump about, and at last, as the music and noise\r\nof the singers increased, she often sprang three feet from the ground.\r\nWhen the music slackened, she would appear quite out of temper, but\r\nwhen it became louder, she would smile and be delighted. During this\r\nexercise, she never showed the least symptom of being tired, though the\r\nmusicians were thoroughly exhausted; and when they stopped to refresh\r\nthemselves by drinking and resting a little, she would discover signs\r\nof discontent.\r\n\r\n“Next day, according to the custom in the cure of this disorder,\r\nshe was taken into the market-place, where several jars of _maize_\r\nor _tsug_ were set in order by the relations, to give drink to the\r\nmusicians and dancers. When the crowd had assembled and the music was\r\nready, she was brought forth and began to dance and throw herself into\r\nthe maddest postures imaginable, and in this manner she kept on the\r\nwhole day. Towards evening, she began to let fall her silver ornaments\r\nfrom her neck, arms, and legs, one at a time, so that, in the course of\r\nthree hours, she was stripped of every article. A relation continually\r\nkept going after her as she danced, to pick up the ornaments, and\r\nafterwards delivered them to the owners from whom they were borrowed.\r\nAs the sun went down, she made a start with such swiftness, that the\r\nfastest runner could not come up with her, and when at the distance\r\nof about two hundred yards, she dropped on a sudden, as if shot. Soon\r\nafterwards, a young man, on coming up with her, fired a matchlock over\r\nher body, and struck her upon the back with the broad side of his large\r\nknife, and asked her name, to which she answered as when in her common\r\nsenses—a sure proof of her being cured; for, during the time of this\r\nmalady, those afflicted with it never answer to their Christian names.\r\nShe was now taken up in a very weak condition and carried home, and a\r\npriest came and baptized her again in the name of the Father, Son, and\r\nHoly Ghost, which ceremony concluded her cure. Some are taken in this\r\nmanner to the market-place for many days before they can be cured, and\r\nit sometimes happens that they cannot be cured at all. I have seen\r\nthem in these fits dance with a _bruly_, or bottle of maize, upon\r\ntheir heads, without spilling the liquor, or letting the bottle fall,\r\nalthough they have put themselves into the most extravagant postures.\r\n\r\n“I could not have ventured to write this from hearsay, nor could\r\nI conceive it possible, until I was obliged to put this remedy in\r\npractice upon my own wife[320], who was seized with the same disorder,\r\nand then I was compelled to have a still nearer view of this strange\r\ndisorder. I at first thought that a whip would be of some service, and\r\none day attempted a few strokes when unnoticed by any person, we being\r\nby ourselves, and I having a strong suspicion that this ailment sprang\r\nfrom the weak minds of women, who were encouraged in it for the sake\r\nof the grandeur, rich dress, and music which accompany the cure. But\r\nhow much was I surprised, the moment I struck a light blow, thinking to\r\ndo good, to find that she became like a corpse, and even the joints of\r\nher fingers became so stiff that I could not straighten them; indeed,\r\nI really thought that she was dead, and immediately made it known to\r\nthe people in the house that she had fainted, but did not tell them the\r\ncause, upon which they immediately brought music, which I had for many\r\ndays denied them, and which soon revived her; and I then left the house\r\nto her relations to cure her at my expense, in the manner I have before\r\nmentioned, though it took a much longer time to cure my wife than the\r\nwoman I have just given an account of. One day I went privately, with\r\na companion, to see my wife dance, and kept at a short distance, as\r\nI was ashamed to go near the crowd. On looking stedfastly upon her,\r\nwhile dancing or jumping more like a deer than a human being, I said\r\nthat it certainly was not my wife; at which my companion burst into\r\na fit of laughter, from which he could scarcely refrain all the way\r\nhome. Men are sometimes afflicted with this dreadful disorder, but not\r\nfrequently. Among the Amhara and Galla it is not so common.”\r\n\r\nSuch is the account of Pearce, who is every way worthy of credit,\r\nand whose lively description renders the traditions of former times\r\nrespecting the St. Vitus’s dance and Tarantism intelligible even\r\nto those who are sceptical respecting the existence of a morbid\r\nstate of the mind and body of the kind described, because, in the\r\npresent advanced state of civilization among the nations of Europe,\r\nopportunities for its development no longer occur. The credibility\r\nof this energetic, but by no means ambitious man, is not liable to\r\nthe slightest suspicion, for, owing to his want of education, he had\r\nno knowledge of the phenomenon in question, and his work evinces\r\nthroughout his attractive and unpretending impartiality.\r\n\r\nComparison is the mother of observation, and may here elucidate one\r\nphenomena by another—the past by that which still exists. Oppression,\r\ninsecurity, and the influence of a very rude priestcraft, are the\r\npowerful causes which operated on the Germans and Italians of the\r\nmiddle ages, as they now continue to operate on the Abyssinians of the\r\npresent day. However these people may differ from us in their descent,\r\ntheir manners and their customs, the effects of the above-mentioned\r\ncauses are the same in Africa as they were in Europe, for they operate\r\non man himself independently of the particular locality in which he may\r\nbe planted; and the condition of the Abyssinians of modern times is,\r\nin regard to superstition, a mirror of the condition of the European\r\nnations in the middle ages. Should this appear a bold assertion, it\r\nwill be strengthened by the fact, that in Abyssinia, two examples\r\nof superstitions occur, which are completely in accordance with\r\noccurrences of the middle ages that took place contemporarily with the\r\ndancing mania. _The Abyssinians have their Christian flagellants, and\r\nthere exists among them a belief in a Zoomorphism, which presents a\r\nlively image of the lycanthropy of the middle ages._ Their flagellants\r\nare called Zackarys. They are united into a separate Christian\r\nfraternity, and make their processions through the towns and villages\r\nwith great noise and tumult, scourging themselves till they draw blood,\r\nand wounding themselves with knives[321]. They boast that they are\r\ndescendants of St. George. It is precisely in Tigrè, the country of the\r\nAbyssinian dancing mania, where they are found in the greatest numbers,\r\nand where they have, in the neighbourhood of Axum, a church of their\r\nown, dedicated to their patron saint _Oun Arvel_. Here there is an\r\never-burning lamp, and they contrive to impress a belief that this is\r\nkept alight by supernatural means. They also here keep a holy water,\r\nwhich is said to be a cure for those who are affected by the dancing\r\nmania.\r\n\r\nThe Abyssinian Zoomorphism is a no less important phenomenon, and shows\r\nitself in a manner quite peculiar. The blacksmiths and potters form,\r\namong the Abyssinians, a society, or caste called in Tigrè _Tebbib_,\r\nand in Amhara _Buda_, which is held in some degree of contempt, and\r\nexcluded from the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, because it is\r\nbelieved that they can change themselves into hyænas and other beasts\r\nof prey, on which account they are feared by every body, and regarded\r\nwith horror. They artfully contrive to keep up this superstition,\r\nbecause by this separation they preserve a monopoly of their lucrative\r\ntrades, and as in other respects they are good Christians, (but few\r\nJews or Mahomedans live among them,) they seem to attach no great\r\nconsequence to their excommunication. As a badge of distinction, they\r\nwear a golden earring, which is frequently found in the ears of hyænas\r\nthat are killed, without its having ever been discovered how they catch\r\nthese animals, so as to decorate them with this strange ornament,\r\nand this removes, in the minds of the people, all doubt as to the\r\nsupernatural powers of the smiths and potters[322]. To the budas is\r\nalso ascribed the gift of enchantment, especially that of the influence\r\nof the evil eye[323]. They nevertheless live unmolested, and are not\r\ncondemned to the flames by fanatical priests, as the lycanthropes were\r\nin the middle ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                               SYMPATHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nImitation—compassion—sympathy, these are imperfect designations for a\r\ncommon bond of union among human beings—for an instinct which connects\r\nindividuals with the general body, which embraces with equal force,\r\nreason and folly, good and evil, and diminishes the praise of virtue\r\nas well as the criminality of vice. In this impulse there are degrees,\r\nbut no essential differences, from the first intellectual efforts of\r\nthe infant mind, which are in a great measure based on imitation, to\r\nthat morbid condition of the soul in which the sensible impression of\r\na nervous malady fetters the mind, and finds its way, through the eye,\r\ndirectly to the diseased texture, as the electric shock is propagated\r\nby contact from body to body. To this instinct of imitation, when it\r\nexists in its highest degree, is united a loss of all power over the\r\nwill, which occurs as soon as the impression on the senses has become\r\nfirmly established, producing a condition like that of small animals\r\nwhen they are fascinated by the look of a serpent. By this mental\r\nbondage, morbid sympathy is clearly and definitely distinguished from\r\nall subordinate degrees of this instinct, however closely allied the\r\nimitation of a disorder may seem to be to that of a mere folly, of an\r\nabsurd fashion, of an awkward habit in speech and manner, or even of a\r\nconfusion of ideas. Even these latter imitations, however, directed as\r\nthey are to foolish and pernicious objects, place the self-independence\r\nof the greater portion of mankind in a very doubtful light, and account\r\nfor their union into a social whole. Still more nearly allied to morbid\r\nsympathy than the imitation of enticing folly, although often with\r\na considerable admixture of the latter, is the diffusion of violent\r\nexcitements, especially those of a religious or political character,\r\nwhich have so powerfully agitated the nations of ancient and modern\r\ntimes, and which may, after an incipient compliance[324], pass into a\r\ntotal loss of power over the will, and an actual disease of the mind.\r\nFar be it from us to attempt to awaken all the various tones of this\r\nchord, whose vibrations reveal the profound secrets which lie hid in\r\nthe inmost recesses of the soul. We might well want powers adequate\r\nto so vast an undertaking. Our business here is only with that morbid\r\nsympathy, by the aid of which the dancing mania of the middle ages grew\r\ninto a real epidemic. In order to make this apparent by comparison, it\r\nmay not be out of place, at the close of this inquiry, to introduce a\r\nfew striking examples:—\r\n\r\n1. “At a cotton manufactory at Hodden Bridge, in Lancashire, a girl, on\r\nthe fifteenth of February 1787, put a mouse into the bosom of another\r\ngirl, who had a great dread of mice. The girl was immediately thrown\r\ninto a fit, and continued in it, with the most violent convulsions, for\r\ntwenty-four hours. On the following day, three more girls were seized\r\nin the same manner; and on the 17th, six more. By this time, the alarm\r\nwas so great, that the whole work, in which 200 or 300 were employed,\r\nwas totally stopped, and an idea prevailed that a particular disease\r\nhad been introduced by a bag of cotton opened in the house. On Sunday\r\nthe 18th, Dr. St. Clare was sent for from Preston; before he arrived\r\nthree more were seized, and during that night and the morning of the\r\n19th, eleven more, making in all twenty-four. Of these, twenty-one\r\nwere young women, two were girls of about ten years of age, and one\r\nman, who had been much fatigued with holding the girls. Three of the\r\nnumber lived about two miles from the place where the disorder first\r\nbroke out, and three at another factory at Clitheroe, about five miles\r\ndistant, which last and two more were infected entirely from report,\r\nnot having seen the other patients, but, like them and the rest of the\r\ncountry, strongly impressed with the idea of the plague being caught\r\nfrom the cotton. The symptoms were anxiety, strangulation, and very\r\nstrong convulsions; and these were so violent as to last without any\r\nintermission from a quarter of an hour to twenty-four hours, and to\r\nrequire four or five persons to prevent the patients from tearing their\r\nhair and dashing their heads against the floor or walls. Dr. St. Clare\r\nhad taken with him a portable electrical machine, and by electric\r\nshocks the patients were universally relieved without exception. As\r\nsoon as the patients and the country were assured that the complaint\r\nwas merely nervous, easily cured, and not introduced by the cotton,\r\nno fresh person was affected. To dissipate their apprehensions still\r\nfurther, the best effects were obtained by causing them to take a\r\ncheerful glass and join in a dance. On Tuesday the 20th, they danced,\r\nand the next day were all at work, except two or three, who were much\r\nweakened by their fits.”[325]\r\n\r\nThe occurrence here described is remarkable on this account, that there\r\nwas no important predisposing cause for convulsions in these young\r\nwomen, unless we consider as such their miserable and confined life\r\nin the work-rooms of a spinning manufactory. It did not arise from\r\nenthusiasm, nor is it stated that the patients had been the subjects\r\nof any other nervous disorders. In another perfectly analogous case,\r\nthose attacked were all suffering from nervous complaints, which\r\nroused a morbid sympathy in them at the sight of a person seized with\r\nconvulsions. This, together with the supervention of hysterical fits,\r\nmay aptly enough be compared to Tarantism.\r\n\r\n2. “A young woman of the lowest order, twenty-one years of age, and\r\nof a strong frame, came on the 13th of January, 1801, to visit a\r\npatient in the Charité hospital at Berlin, where she had herself\r\nbeen previously under treatment for an inflammation of the chest\r\nwith tetanic spasms, and immediately on entering the ward, fell down\r\nin strong convulsions. At the sight of her violent contortions, six\r\nother female patients immediately became affected in the same way,\r\nand by degrees eight more were in like manner attacked with strong\r\nconvulsions. All these patients were from sixteen to twenty-five years\r\nof age, and suffered without exception, one from spasms in the stomach,\r\nanother from palsy, a third from lethargy, a fourth from fits with\r\nconsciousness, a fifth from catalepsy, a sixth from syncope, &c. The\r\nconvulsions, which alternate in various ways with tonic spasms, were\r\naccompanied by loss of sensibility, and were invariably preceded by\r\nlanguor with heavy sleep, which was followed by the fits in the course\r\nof a minute or two; and it is remarkable, that in all these patients\r\ntheir former nervous disorders, not excepting paralysis, disappeared,\r\nreturning, however, after the subsequent removal of their new\r\ncomplaint. The treatment, during the course of which two of the nurses,\r\nwho were young women, suffered similar attacks, was continued for four\r\nmonths. It was finally successful, and consisted principally in the\r\nadministration of opium, at that time the favourite remedy[326].”\r\n\r\nNow, every species of enthusiasm, every strong affection, every violent\r\npassion, may lead to convulsions—to mental disorders—to a concussion of\r\nthe nerves, from the sensorium to the very finest extremities of the\r\nspinal chord. The whole world is full of examples of this afflicting\r\nstate of turmoil, which, when the mind is carried away by the force\r\nof a sensual impression that destroys its freedom, is irresistibly\r\npropagated by imitation. Those who are thus infected do not spare even\r\ntheir own lives, but, as a hunted flock of sheep will follow their\r\nleader and rush over a precipice, so will whole hosts of enthusiasts,\r\ndeluded by their infatuation, hurry on to a self-inflicted death. Such\r\nhas ever been the case, from the days of the Milesian virgins to the\r\nmodern associations for self-destruction[327]. Of all enthusiastic\r\ninfatuations, however, that of religion is the most fertile in\r\ndisorders of the mind as well as of the body, and both spread with the\r\ngreatest facility by sympathy. The history of the church furnishes\r\ninnumerable proofs of this, but we need go no further than the most\r\nrecent times.\r\n\r\n3. In a Methodist chapel at Redruth, a man during divine service, cried\r\nout with a loud voice, “What shall I do to be saved?” at the same\r\ntime manifesting the greatest uneasiness and solicitude respecting\r\nthe condition of his soul. Some other members of the congregation,\r\nfollowing his example, cried out in the same form of words, and seemed\r\nshortly after to suffer the most excruciating bodily pain. This strange\r\noccurrence was soon publicly known, and hundreds of people, who had\r\ncome thither, either attracted by curiosity, or a desire, from other\r\nmotives, to see the sufferers, fell into the same state. The chapel\r\nremained open for some days and nights, and from that point the new\r\ndisorder spread itself, with the rapidity of lightning, over the\r\nneighbouring towns of Camborne, Helston, Truro, Penryn, and Falmouth,\r\nas well as over the villages in the vicinity. Whilst thus advancing,\r\nit decreased in some measure at the place where it had first appeared,\r\nand it confined itself throughout to the Methodist chapels. It was\r\nonly by the words which have been mentioned that it was excited, and it\r\nseized none but people of the lowest education. Those who were attacked\r\nbetrayed the greatest anguish, and fell into convulsions; others cried\r\nout, like persons possessed, that the Almighty would straightway pour\r\nout his wrath upon them, that the wailings of tormented spirits rang in\r\ntheir ears, and that they saw hell open to receive them. The clergy,\r\nwhen in the course of their sermons, they perceived that persons\r\nwere thus seized, earnestly exhorted them to confess their sins, and\r\nzealously endeavoured to convince them that they were by nature enemies\r\nto Christ; that the anger of God had therefore fallen upon them; and\r\nthat if death should surprise them in the midst of their sins, the\r\neternal torments of hell would be their portion. The over-excited\r\ncongregation upon this repeated their words, which naturally must have\r\nincreased the fury of their convulsive attacks. When the discourse had\r\nproduced its full effect, the preacher changed his subject; reminded\r\nthose who were suffering, of the power of the Saviour, as well as\r\nof the grace of God, and represented to them in glowing colours the\r\njoys of heaven. Upon this a remarkable reaction sooner or later took\r\nplace. Those who were in convulsions felt themselves raised from the\r\nlowest depths of misery and despair to the most exalted bliss, and\r\ntriumphantly shouted out that their bonds were loosed, their sins were\r\nforgiven, and that they were translated to the wonderful freedom of the\r\nchildren of God. In the mean time, their convulsions continued, and\r\nthey remained, during this condition, so abstracted from every earthly\r\nthought, that they staid two and sometimes three days and nights\r\ntogether in the chapels, agitated all the time by spasmodic movements,\r\nand taking neither repose nor nourishment. According to a moderate\r\ncomputation, 4000 people were, within a very short time, affected with\r\nthis convulsive malady.\r\n\r\nThe course and symptoms of the attacks were in general as\r\nfollows:—There came on at first a feeling of faintness, with rigour\r\nand a sense of weight at the pit of the stomach, soon after which\r\nthe patient cried out, as if in the agonies of death or the pains\r\nof labour. The convulsions then began, first showing themselves in\r\nthe muscles of the eyelids, though the eyes themselves were fixed\r\nand staring. The most frightful contortions of the countenance\r\nfollowed, and the convulsions now took their course downwards, so that\r\nthe muscles of the neck and trunk were affected, causing a sobbing\r\nrespiration, which was performed with great effort. Tremors and\r\nagitation ensued, and the patients screamed out violently, and tossed\r\ntheir heads about from side to side. As the complaint increased, it\r\nseized the arms, and its victims beat their breasts, clasped their\r\nhands, and made all sorts of strange gestures. The observer who gives\r\nthis account remarked that the lower extremities were in no instance\r\naffected. In some cases, exhaustion came on in a very few minutes,\r\nbut the attack usually lasted much longer, and there were even cases\r\nin which it was known to continue for sixty or seventy hours. Many of\r\nthose who happened to be seated when the attack commenced, bent their\r\nbodies rapidly backwards and forwards during its continuance, making a\r\ncorresponding motion with their arms, like persons sawing wood. Others\r\nshouted aloud, leaped about, and threw their bodies into every possible\r\nposture, until they had exhausted their strength. Yawning took place\r\nat the commencement in all cases, but as the violence of the disorder\r\nincreased, the circulation and respiration became accelerated, so\r\nthat the countenance assumed a swollen and puffed appearance. When\r\nexhaustion came on, patients usually fainted, and remained in a stiff\r\nand motionless state until their recovery. The disorder completely\r\nresembled the St. Vitus’s dance, but the fits sometimes went on to\r\nan extraordinarily violent extent, so that the author of the account\r\nonce saw a woman, who was seized with these convulsions, resist the\r\nendeavours of four or five strong men to restrain her. Those patients\r\nwho did not lose their consciousness were in general made more furious\r\nby every attempt to quiet them by force, on which account they were in\r\ngeneral suffered to continue unmolested until nature herself brought\r\non exhaustion. Those affected complained, more or less, of debility\r\nafter the attacks, and cases sometimes occurred in which they passed\r\ninto other disorders: thus some fell into a state of melancholy, which,\r\nhowever, in consequence of their religious ecstacy, was distinguished\r\nby the absence of fear and despair; and in one patient inflammation of\r\nthe brain is said to have taken place. No sex or age was exempt from\r\nthis epidemic malady. Children five years old and octogenarians were\r\nalike affected by it, and even men of the most powerful frame were\r\nsubject to its influence. Girls and young women, however, were its most\r\nfrequent victims[328].\r\n\r\n4. For the last hundred years a nervous affection of a perfectly\r\nsimilar kind has existed in the Shetland Islands, which furnishes\r\na striking example, perhaps the only one now existing, of the very\r\nlasting propagation by sympathy of this species of disorders. The\r\norigin of the malady was very insignificant. An epileptic woman had a\r\nfit in church, and whether it was that the minds of the congregation\r\nwere excited by devotion, or that, being overcome at the sight of\r\nthe strong convulsions, their sympathy was called forth, certain it\r\nis, that many adult women, and even children, some of whom were of\r\nthe male sex, and not more than six years old, began to complain\r\nforthwith of palpitation, followed by faintness, which passed into a\r\nmotionless and apparently cataleptic condition. These symptoms lasted\r\nmore than an hour, and probably recurred frequently. In the course of\r\ntime, however, this malady is said to have undergone a modification,\r\nsuch as it exhibits at the present day. Women whom it has attacked\r\nwill suddenly fall down, toss their arms about, writhe their bodies\r\ninto various shapes, move their heads suddenly from side to side, and\r\nwith eyes fixed and staring, utter the most dismal cries. If the fit\r\nhappen on any occasion of public diversion, they will, as soon as it\r\nhas ceased, mix with their companions and continue their amusement as\r\nif nothing had happened. Paroxysms of this kind used to prevail most\r\nduring the warm months of summer, and about fifty years ago there was\r\nscarcely a Sabbath in which they did not occur. Strong passions of\r\nthe mind, induced by religious enthusiasm, are also exciting causes\r\nof these fits, but like all such false tokens of divine workings,\r\nthey are easily encountered by producing in the patient a different\r\nframe of mind, and especially by exciting a sense of shame: thus those\r\naffected are under the control of any sensible preacher, who knows\r\nhow to “administer to a mind diseased,” and to expose the folly of\r\nvoluntarily yielding to a sympathy so easily resisted, or of inviting\r\nsuch attacks by affectation. An intelligent and pious minister of\r\nShetland informed the physician, who gives an account of this\r\ndisorder as an eye-witness, that being considerably annoyed, on his\r\nfirst introduction into the country, by these paroxysms, whereby the\r\ndevotions of the church were much impeded, he obviated their repetition\r\nby assuring his parishioners, that no treatment was more effectual than\r\nimmersion in cold water; and as his kirk was fortunately contiguous to\r\na freshwater lake, he gave notice that attendants should be at hand,\r\nduring divine service, to ensure the proper means of cure. The sequel\r\nneed scarcely be told. The fear of being carried out of the church,\r\nand into the water, acted like a charm; not a single Naiad was made,\r\nand the worthy minister, for many years, had reason to boast of one of\r\nthe best regulated congregations in Shetland. As the physician above\r\nalluded to was attending divine service in the kirk of Baliasta, on\r\nthe Isle of Unst, a female shriek, the indication of a convulsion fit,\r\nwas heard; the minister, Mr. Ingram, of Fetlar, very properly stopped\r\nhis discourse, until the disturber was removed; and, after advising\r\nall those who thought they might be similarly affected, to leave the\r\nchurch, he gave out, in the meantime, a psalm. The congregation was\r\nthus preserved from further interruption; yet the effect of sympathy\r\nwas not prevented, for as the narrator of the account was leaving the\r\nchurch, he saw several females writhing and tossing about their arms on\r\nthe green grass, who durst not, for fear of a censure from the pulpit,\r\nexhibit themselves after this manner within the sacred walls of the\r\nkirk[329].\r\n\r\nIn the production of this disorder, which no doubt still exists,\r\nfanaticism certainly had a smaller share than the irritable state of\r\nwomen out of health, who only needed excitement, no matter of what\r\nkind, to throw them into the prevailing nervous paroxysms. When,\r\nhowever, that powerful cause of nervous disorders takes the lead, we\r\nfind far more remarkable symptoms developed, and it then depends on the\r\nmental condition of the people among whom they appear, whether in their\r\nspread, they shall take a narrow or an extended range—whether confined\r\nto some small knot of zealots they are to vanish without a trace, or\r\nwhether they are to attain even historical importance.\r\n\r\n5. The appearance of the _Convulsionnaires_ in France, whose\r\ninhabitants, from the greater mobility of their blood, have in\r\ngeneral been the less liable to fanaticism, is, in this respect,\r\ninstructive and worthy of attention. In the year 1727 there died, in\r\nthe capital of that country, the Deacon Pâris, a zealous opposer of the\r\nUltramontanists, division having arisen in the French church on account\r\nof the bull “Unigenitus.” People made frequent visits to his tomb, in\r\nthe cemetery of St. Medard, and four years afterwards, (in September,\r\n1731,) a rumour was spread, that miracles took place there. Patients\r\nwere seized with convulsions and tetanic spasms, rolled upon the ground\r\nlike persons possessed, were thrown into violent contortions of their\r\nheads and limbs, and suffered the greatest oppression, accompanied by\r\nquickness and irregularity of pulse. This novel occurrence excited\r\nthe greatest sensation all over Paris, and an immense concourse of\r\npeople resorted daily to the above named cemetery, in order to see\r\nso wonderful a spectacle, which the Ultramontanists immediately\r\ninterpreted as a work of Satan, while their opponents ascribed it to a\r\ndivine influence. The disorder soon increased, until it produced, in\r\nnervous women, _clairvoyance_, (_Schlafwachen_,) a phenomenon till then\r\nunknown; for one female especially attracted attention, who blindfold,\r\nand, as it was believed, by means of the sense of smell, read every\r\nwriting that was placed before her, and distinguished the characters of\r\nunknown persons. The very earth taken from the grave of the Deacon, was\r\nsoon thought to possess miraculous power. It was sent to numerous sick\r\npersons at a distance, whereby they were said to have been cured, and\r\nthus this nervous disorder spread far beyond the limits of the capital,\r\nso that at one time it was computed that there were more than eight\r\nhundred decided _Convulsionnaires_, who would hardly have increased\r\nso much in numbers, had not Louis XV. directed that the cemetery\r\nshould be closed[330]. The disorder itself assumed various forms,\r\nand augmented, by its attacks, the general excitement. Many persons,\r\nbesides suffering from the convulsions, became the subjects of violent\r\npain, which required the assistance of their brethren of the faith. On\r\nthis account they, as well as those who afforded them aid, were called\r\nby the common title of _Secourists_. The modes of relief adopted were\r\nremarkably in accordance with those which were administered to the\r\nSt. John’s dancers and the Tarantati, and they were in general very\r\nrough; for the sufferers were beaten and goaded in various parts of\r\nthe body with stones, hammers, swords, clubs, &c., of which treatment\r\nthe defenders of this extraordinary sect relate the most astonishing\r\nexamples, in proof that severe pain is imperatively demanded by nature\r\nin this disorder, as an effectual counter-irritant. The Secourists used\r\nwooden clubs, in the same manner as paviors use their mallets, and it\r\nis stated that some Convulsionnaires have borne daily from six to eight\r\nthousand blows, thus inflicted, without danger[331]. One Secourist\r\nadministered to a young woman, who was suffering under spasm of the\r\nstomach, the most violent blows on that part, not to mention other\r\nsimilar cases, which occurred everywhere in great numbers. Sometimes\r\nthe patients bounded from the ground, impelled by the convulsions,\r\nlike fish when out of water; and this was so frequently imitated at a\r\nlater period, that the women and girls, when they expected such violent\r\ncontortions, not wishing to appear indecent, put on gowns, made like\r\nsacks, closed at the feet. If they received any bruises by falling\r\ndown, they were healed with earth from the grave of the uncanonized\r\nsaint. They usually, however, showed great agility in this respect,\r\nand it is scarcely necessary to remark that the female sex especially\r\nwas distinguished by all kinds of leaping, and almost inconceivable\r\ncontortions of body. Some spun round on their feet with incredible\r\nrapidity, as is related of the dervishes; others ran their heads\r\nagainst walls, or curved their bodies like rope-dancers, so that their\r\nheels touched their shoulders.\r\n\r\nAll this degenerated at length into decided insanity. A certain\r\nConvulsionnaire, at Vernon, who had formerly led rather a loose course\r\nof life, employed herself in confessing the other sex; in other places\r\nwomen of this sect were seen imposing exercises of penance on priests,\r\nduring which these were compelled to kneel before them. Others played\r\nwith children’s rattles, or drew about small carts, and gave to these\r\nchildish acts symbolical significations[332]. One Convulsionnaire\r\neven made believe to shave her chin, and gave religious instruction\r\nat the same time, in order to imitate Pâris, the worker of miracles,\r\nwho, during this operation, and whilst at table, was in the habit of\r\npreaching. Some had a board placed across their bodies, upon which a\r\nwhole row of men stood; and as, in this unnatural state of mind, a\r\nkind of pleasure is derived from excruciating pain, some too were seen\r\nwho caused their bosoms to be pinched with tongs, while others, with\r\ngowns closed at the feet, stood upon their heads, and remained in that\r\nposition longer than would have been possible had they been in health.\r\nPinault, the advocate, who belonged to this sect, barked like a dog\r\nsome hours every day, and even this found imitation among the believers.\r\n\r\nThe insanity of the Convulsionnaires lasted, without interruption,\r\nuntil the year 1790, and during these fifty-nine years, called\r\nforth more lamentable phenomena than the enlightened spirits of the\r\neighteenth century would be willing to allow. The grossest immorality\r\nfound, in the secret meetings of the believers, a sure sanctuary, and,\r\nin their bewildering devotional exercises, a convenient cloak. It was\r\nof no avail that, in the year 1762, the Grands Secours was forbidden by\r\nact of parliament; for thenceforth this work was carried on in secrecy,\r\nand with greater zeal than ever; it was in vain, too, that some\r\nphysicians, and, among the rest, the austere, pious Hecquet[333], and\r\nafter him Lorry[334], attributed the conduct of the Convulsionnaires\r\nto natural causes. Men of distinction among the upper classes, as,\r\nfor instance, Montgeron the deputy, and Lambert an ecclesiastic (obt.\r\n1813), stood forth as the defenders of this sect; and the numerous\r\nwritings[335] which were exchanged on the subject, served, by the\r\nimportance which they thus attached to it, to give it stability. The\r\nrevolution, finally, shook the structure of this pernicious mysticism.\r\nIt was not, however, destroyed; for, even during the period of the\r\ngreatest excitement, the secret meetings were still kept up; prophetic\r\nbooks, by Convulsionnaires of various denominations, have appeared\r\neven in the most recent times, and only a few years ago (in 1828) this\r\nonce celebrated sect still existed, although without the convulsions\r\nand the extraordinarily rude aid of the brethren of the faith, which,\r\namidst the boasted pre-eminence of French intellectual advancement,\r\nremind us most forcibly of the dark ages of the St. John’s dancers[336].\r\n\r\n6. Similar fanatical sects exhibit among all nations[337] of ancient\r\nand modern times the same phenomena. An over-strained bigotry is,\r\nin itself, and considered in a medical point of view, a destructive\r\nirritation of the senses, which draws men away from the efficiency of\r\nmental freedom, and peculiarly favours the most injurious emotions.\r\nSensual ebullitions, with strong convulsions of the nerves, appear\r\nsooner or later[338], and insanity, suicidal disgust of life,\r\nand incurable nervous disorders[339], are but too frequently the\r\nconsequences of a perverse, and, indeed, hypocritical zeal, which has\r\never prevailed, as well in the assemblies of the Mænades and Corybantes\r\nof antiquity, as under the semblance of religion among the Christians\r\nand Mahomedans.\r\n\r\nThere are some denominations of English Methodists which surpass, if\r\npossible, the French Convulsionnaires; and we may here mention, in\r\nparticular, the Jumpers, among whom it is still more difficult, than\r\nin the example given above, to draw the line between religious ecstacy\r\nand a perfect disorder of the nerves; sympathy, however, operates\r\nperhaps more perniciously on them than on other fanatical assemblies.\r\nThe sect of Jumpers was founded in the year 1760, in the county of\r\nCornwall, by two fanatics[340], who were, even at that time, able to\r\ncollect together a considerable party. Their general doctrine is that\r\nof the Methodists, and claims our consideration here, only in so far\r\nas it enjoins them, during their devotional exercises, to fall into\r\nconvulsions, which they are able to effect in the strangest manner\r\nimaginable. By the use of certain unmeaning words, they work themselves\r\nup into a state of religious frenzy, in which they seem to have\r\nscarcely any control over their senses. They then begin to jump with\r\nstrange gestures, repeating this exercise with all their might, until\r\nthey are exhausted, so that it not unfrequently happens that women,\r\nwho, like the Mænades, practise these religious exercises, are carried\r\naway from the midst of them in a state of syncope, whilst the remaining\r\nmembers of the congregations, for miles together, on their way home,\r\nterrify those whom they meet by the sight of such demoniacal ravings.\r\nThere are never more than a few ecstatics, who, by their example,\r\nexcite the rest to jump, and these are followed by the greatest part\r\nof the meeting, so that these assemblages of the Jumpers resemble, for\r\nhours together, the wildest orgies, rather than congregations met for\r\nChristian edification[341].\r\n\r\nIn the United States of North America, communities of Methodists\r\nhave existed for the last sixty years. The reports of credible\r\nwitnesses of their assemblages for divine service in the open-air\r\n(camp meetings)[342], to which many thousands flock from great\r\ndistances[343], surpass, indeed, all belief; for not only do they\r\nthere repeat all the insane acts of the French Convulsionnaires and\r\nof the English Jumpers, but the disorder of their minds and of their\r\nnerves attains, at these meetings, a still greater height. Women have\r\nbeen seen to miscarry whilst suffering under the state of ecstacy and\r\nviolent spasms into which they are thrown, and others have publicly\r\nstripped themselves and jumped into the rivers. They have swooned\r\naway[344] by hundreds, worn out with ravings and fits; and of the\r\nBarkers, who appeared among the Convulsionnaires only here and there,\r\nin single cases of complete aberration of intellect, whole bands are\r\nseen running on all fours, and growling[345] as if they wished to\r\nindicate, even by their outward form, the shocking degradation of their\r\nhuman nature. At these camp-meetings the children are witnesses of\r\nthis mad infatuation, and as their weak nerves are, with the greatest\r\nfacility, affected by sympathy, they, together with their parents, fall\r\ninto violent fits, though they know nothing of their import, and many\r\nof them retain for life some severe nervous disorder, which, having\r\narisen from fright and excessive excitement, will not afterwards yield\r\nto any medical treatment[346].\r\n\r\nBut enough of these extravagances, which, even in our own days,\r\nembitter the lives of so many thousands, and exhibit to the world, in\r\nthe nineteenth century, the same terrific form of mental disturbance as\r\nthe St. Vitus’s dance once did to the benighted nations of the middle\r\nages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  I.\r\n\r\n  _Petri de Herentals_, Prioris Floreffiensis Vita _Gregorii\r\n    XI._, in _Stephan.

Tum solus respondit dæmon: Nos eramus duo, sed socius meus\r\nnequior me, ante me exivit, habui tot pati in hoc corpore, si essem\r\nextra, nunquam intrarem in corpus Christianum. Cui presbyter: Quare\r\nintrasti corpora talium personarum? Respondit: Clerici et presbyteres\r\ndicunt tot pulchra verba et tot orationes, ut non possemus intrare\r\ncorpora ipsorum.

Sinclair’s statistical\r\naccount, and from which I have thought it illustrative of our author’s\r\nsubject to make some extracts; the first that is noticed is peculiar to\r\na part of Forfarshire, and is called the leaping ague, which bears so\r\nclose an analogy to the original St. Vitus’s Dance, or to Tarantism,\r\nthat it seems to want only the “foul fiend,” or the dreaded bite, as\r\na cause, and a Scotch reel or strathspey as a cure, to render the\r\nresemblance quite complete. “Those affected with it first complain\r\nof a pain in the head, or lower part of the back, to which succeed\r\nconvulsive fits, or _fits of dancing_, at certain periods. During the\r\nparoxysm they have all the appearance of madness, distorting their\r\nbodies in various ways, and leaping and springing in a surprising\r\nmanner, whence the disease has derived its vulgar name. Sometimes they\r\nrun with astonishing velocity, and often over dangerous passes, to\r\nsome place out of doors, which they have fixed on in their own minds,\r\nor, perhaps, even mentioned to those in company with them, and then\r\n_drop down quite exhausted_. At other times, especially when confined\r\nto the house, they climb in the most singular manner. In cottages, for\r\nexample, they leap from the floor to what is called the baulks, or\r\nthose beams by which the rafters are joined together, springing from\r\none to another with the agility of a cat, or whirling round one of\r\nthem, with a motion resembling the fly of a jack. Cold bathing is found\r\nto be the most effectual remedy; but when the fit of dancing, leaping,\r\nor running comes on, _nothing tends so much to abate the violence of\r\nthe disease, as allowing them free scope to exercise themselves, till\r\nnature be exhausted_. No mention is made of its being peculiar to any\r\nage, sex, or condition of life, although I am informed by a gentleman\r\nfrom Brechin, that it is most common before puberty. In some families\r\nit seems to be hereditary; and I have heard of one, in which a horse\r\nwas always kept ready saddled, to follow the young ladies belonging to\r\nit, when they were seized with a fit of running. It was first observed\r\nin the parish of Kenmuir, and has prevailed occasionally in that and\r\nthe neighbouring parishes, for about seventy years: but it is not now\r\nnearly so frequent as it was about thirty years ago. The history of\r\nthis singular affection is still extremely imperfect: and it is only\r\nfrom some of the medical practitioners in that part of the country\r\nwhere it prevails, that a complete description can be expected.”\r\n\r\nOur author has already noticed the convulsive disease prevalent in\r\nthe Shetland Islands, and has quoted Hibbert’s account of it. The\r\nfollowing, however, from a very valuable manuscript account of the\r\nOrkney and Shetland Islands, drawn up about 1774, by George Low, with\r\nnotes, by Mr. Pennant, is given in the journal already cited, and will\r\nbe read with interest. The facts were communicated to Mr. Low by the\r\nRev. Wm. Archibald, parochial clergyman of Unst, the most northerly of\r\nthe Shetlands.\r\n\r\n“There is a most shocking distemper, which has of late years prevailed\r\nvery much, especially among young women, and was hardly known thirty\r\nor forty years ago. About that period only one person was subject to\r\nit. The inhabitants give it the name of convulsion fits; and indeed,\r\nin appearance it something resembles epilepsy. In its first rise, it\r\nbegan with a palpitation of the heart, of which they complained for a\r\nconsiderable time; it at length produced swooning fits, in which people\r\nseized with it would lie motionless upwards of an hour. At length, as\r\nthe distemper gathered strength, when any violent passion seized, or\r\non a sudden surprise, they would all at once fall down, toss their\r\narms about, with their bodies, into many odd shapes, crying out all\r\nthe while most dismally, throwing their heads about from side to side,\r\nwith their eyes fixed and staring. At first this distemper obtained\r\nin a private way, with one female, but she being seized in a public\r\nway, at church, the disease was communicated to others; but, whether\r\nby the influence of _fear_ or _sympathy_, is not easy to determine.\r\nHowever this was, our public assemblies, especially at church, became\r\ngreatly disturbed by their outcries. This distemper always prevails\r\nmost violently during the summer time, in which season, for many years,\r\nwe are hardly one sabbath free. In these few years past, it has not\r\nprevailed so extensively, and upon the whole, seems on the decline.\r\nOne thing remarkable in this distemper is, that as soon as the fit is\r\nover, the persons affected with it are generally as lively and brisk\r\nas before; and if it happens at any of their public diversions, as\r\nsoon as they revive, they mix with their companions, and continue\r\ntheir amusement as vigorously as if nothing had happened. Few men are\r\ntroubled with this distemper, which seems more confined to women; but\r\nthere are instances of its seizing men, and girls of six years of\r\nage. With respect to the nature of this disease, people who have made\r\nenquiry about it differ, but most imagine it hysterical; however, this\r\nseems not entirely the case, as men and children are subject to it;\r\nhowever, it is a new disease in Shetland, but whence imported, none can\r\nimagine.\r\n\r\n“When the statistical account of this parish was published, this awful\r\nand afflicting disease was becoming daily less common. In the parishes\r\nof Aithsting, Sandsting, and Northmaven, in which it was once very\r\nfrequent, it was now totally extinct. In the last of these the cure is\r\nsaid to have been effected by a very singular remedy, which, if true,\r\nand there seems no reason to doubt it, shows the influence of moral\r\ncauses in removing, as well as in inducing convulsive disorders.” The\r\ncure is attributed to a rough fellow of a kirk officer, who tossed a\r\nwoman in that state, with whom he had been frequently troubled, into a\r\nditch of water. She was never known to have the disease afterwards, and\r\nothers dreaded the same treatment.\r\n\r\n“It, however, still prevails in some of the northern parishes,\r\nparticularly in Delting, although, according to the description given\r\nof it, with some alteration in its symptoms.\r\n\r\n“Convulsion fits of a very extraordinary kind seem peculiar to this\r\ncountry. The patient is first seized with something like fainting, and\r\nimmediately after utters wild cries and shrieks, the sound of which, at\r\nwhatever distance, immediately puts all who are subject to the disorder\r\nin the same situation. It most commonly attacks them when the church\r\nis crowded, and often interrupts the service in this and many other\r\nchurches in the country. On a sacramental occasion, fifty or sixty\r\nare sometimes carried out of the church, and laid in the churchyard,\r\nwhere they struggle and roar with all their strength, for five or ten\r\nminutes, and then rise up without recollecting a single circumstance\r\nthat happened to them, or being in the least hurt or fatigued with\r\nthe violent exertions they had made during the fit. One observation\r\noccurs on this disorder, that, during the late scarce years it was\r\nvery uncommon, and, during the two last years of plenty (1791), it has\r\nappeared more frequently.\r\n\r\n“Similar instances of epidemical convulsions are already upon record;\r\nbut the history of that which occurred in Anglesea, North Wales, is the\r\nmost remarkable, as its progress was, in all probability, checked by\r\nthe judicious precautions recommended by Dr. Haygarth.\r\n\r\n“In 1796, on the estates of the Earl of Uxbridge and Holland Griffith,\r\nEsq., 23 females, from 10 to 25, and one boy, of about 17 years of age,\r\nwho had all intercourse with each other, were seized with an unusual\r\nkind of convulsions, affecting only the upper extremities. It began\r\nwith pain of the head, and sometimes of the stomach and side, not very\r\nviolent; after which there came on violent twitchings or convulsions of\r\nthe upper extremities, continuing with little intermission, and causing\r\nthe shoulders almost to meet by the exertion. In bed the disorder was\r\nnot so violent: but, in some cases at least, it continued even during\r\nsleep. Their pulse was moderate, the body costive, and the general\r\nhealth not much impaired. In general they had a hiccough; and, when\r\nthe convulsions were most violent, giddiness came on, with the loss\r\nof hearing and recollection. During their convalescence, and they\r\nall recovered, the least fright or sudden alarm brought on a slight\r\nparoxysm.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Haygarth, who was consulted on the means of relieving these\r\nunfortunate people, successfully recommended the use of antispasmodics;\r\nthat all girls and young women should be prevented from having any\r\ncommunication with persons affected with those convulsions; and that\r\nthose who were ill should be kept separate as much as possible.”\r\n\r\nThe same paper from which the above extracts have been taken, quotes\r\na remarkable instance in which religious enthusiasm was the exciting\r\ncause of a convulsive disease analogous to those already noticed. The\r\naccount is given by the Rev. Dr. Meik, at great length. It appears,\r\nthat in January, 1742, about 90 persons in the parish of Cambuslang,\r\nin Lanarkshire, were induced to subscribe a petition to the minister,\r\nurging him to give them a weekly lecture, to which he readily assented.\r\nNothing particular occurred at the first two lectures, but, at the\r\nthird, to which the hearers had been very attentive, when the minister\r\nin his last prayer expressed himself thus, “Lord, who hath believed\r\nour report; and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?—where are the\r\nfruits of my poor labours among this people?” several persons in the\r\ncongregation cried out publicly, and about fifty men and women came\r\nto the minister’s house, expressing strong convictions of sin, and\r\nalarming fears of punishment. After this period, so many people from\r\nthe neighbourhood resorted to Cambuslang, that the minister thought\r\nhimself obliged to provide them with daily sermons or exhortations,\r\nand actually did so for seven or eight months. The way in which the\r\nconverts were affected, for it seems they were affected much in the\r\nsame way, though in very different degrees, is thus described. “They\r\nwere seized, all at once, commonly by something said in the sermons or\r\nprayers, with the most dreadful apprehensions concerning the state of\r\ntheir souls, insomuch that many of them could not abstain from crying\r\nout, in the most public and frightful manner, ‘bewailing their lost\r\nand undone condition by nature; calling themselves enemies to God,\r\nand despisers of precious Christ; declaring that they were unworthy\r\nto live on the face of the earth; that they saw the mouth of hell\r\nopen to receive them, and that they heard the shrieks of the damned;’\r\nbut the universal cry was, ‘What shall we do to be saved?’ The agony\r\nunder which they laboured was expressed, not only by words, but also\r\nby violent agitations of body; by clapping their hands and beating\r\ntheir breasts; by shaking and trembling; by faintings and convulsions;\r\nand sometimes by excessive bleeding at the nose. While they were in\r\nthis distress, the minister often called out to them, not to stifle or\r\nsmother their convictions, but to encourage them: and, after sermon\r\nwas ended, he retired with them to the manse, and frequently spent the\r\nbest part of the night with them in exhortations and prayers. Next day,\r\nbefore sermon began, they were brought out, and, having napkins tied\r\nround their heads, were placed all together on seats before the tents,\r\nwhere they remained sobbing, weeping, and often crying aloud, till the\r\nservice was over. Some of those who fell under conviction were never\r\nconverted; but most of those who fell under it were converted in a few\r\ndays, and sometimes in a few hours. In most cases their conversion\r\nwas as sudden and unexpected as their conviction. They were raised all\r\nat once from the lowest depth of sorrow and distress, to the highest\r\npitch of joy and happiness; crying out with triumph and exultation,\r\n‘that they had overcome the wicked one; that they had gotten hold of\r\nChrist, and would never let him go; that the black cloud which had\r\nhitherto concealed him from their view was now dispelled; and that\r\nthey saw him, with a pen in his hand, blotting out their sins.’ Under\r\nthese delightful impressions, some began to pray, and exhort publicly,\r\nand others desired the congregation to join with them in singing a\r\nparticular psalm, which they said God had commanded them to sing.\r\nFrom the time of their conviction to their conversion, many had no\r\nappetite for food, or inclination to sleep, and all complained of their\r\nsufferings during that interval.”\r\n\r\nThe following account, which closes the paper whence the above\r\nquotations have been extracted, is taken from an Inaugural Essay on\r\nChorea Sancti Viti, by Felix Robertson of Tennessee, 8vo. Philadelph.\r\n1805.\r\n\r\n“The Chorea, which is more particularly the subject of this\r\ndissertation, made its appearance during the summer of 1803, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Maryville, (Tennessee,) in the form of an epidemic.\r\nPreviously to entering on its history, I think it necessary to premise\r\na few cursory remarks on the mode of life of those amongst whom it\r\noriginated, for some time before the appearance of the disease.\r\n\r\n“I suppose there are but few individuals in the United States, who\r\nhave not at least heard of the unparalleled blaze of enthusiastic\r\nreligion which burst forth in the western country, about the year\r\n1800; but it is, perhaps, impossible to have a competent idea of its\r\neffects, without personal observation. This religious enthusiasm\r\ntravelled like electricity, with astonishing velocity, and was felt,\r\n_almost instantaneously_, in every part of the states of Tennessee\r\nand Kentucky. It often proved so powerful a stimulus, that every\r\nother entirely lost its effect, or was but feebly felt. Hence that\r\ngeneral neglect of earthly things, which was observed, and the almost\r\nperpetual attendance at places of public worship. Their churches are,\r\nin general, small and every way uncomfortable; the concourse of people,\r\non days of worship, particularly of extraordinary meetings, was very\r\nnumerous, and hundreds who lived at too great a distance to return home\r\nevery evening, came supplied with provisions, tents, &c., for their\r\nsustenance and accommodation, during the continuance of the meeting,\r\nwhich commonly lasted from three to five days. They, as well as many\r\nothers, remained on the spot day and night, the whole or greater part\r\nof this time, worshipping their Maker almost incessantly. The outward\r\nexpressions of their worship consisted chiefly in alternate crying,\r\nlaughing, singing, and shouting, and, at the same time, performing that\r\nvariety of gesticulation, which the muscular system is capable of\r\nproducing. It was under these circumstances that some found themselves\r\nunable, by voluntary efforts, to suppress the contraction of their\r\nmuscles; and, to their own astonishment, and the diversion of many\r\nof the spectators, they continued to act from necessity, the curious\r\ncharacter which they had commenced from choice.\r\n\r\n“The disease no sooner appeared, than it spread with rapidity through\r\nthe medium of the principle of imitation; thus it was not uncommon for\r\nan affected person to communicate it to the greater part of a crowd,\r\nwho, from curiosity or other motives, had collected around him. It is\r\nat this time, in almost every part of Tennessee and Kentucky, and in\r\nvarious parts of Virginia, but is said not to be contagious (or readily\r\ncommunicated) as at its commencement. It attacks both sexes, and every\r\nconstitution, but evidently more readily those who are enthusiasts in\r\nreligion, such as those above described, and females; children of six\r\nyears of age, and adults of sixty, have been known to have it, but a\r\ngreat majority of those affected are from fifteen to twenty-five. The\r\nmuscles generally affected are those of the trunk, particularly of the\r\nneck, sometimes those of the superior extremities, but very rarely, if\r\never, those of the inferior. The contractions are sudden and violent,\r\nsuch as are denominated convulsive, being sometimes so powerful, when\r\nin the muscles of the back, that the patient is thrown on the ground,\r\nwhere, for some time, his motions more resemble those of a live fish,\r\nwhen thrown on land, than any thing else to which I can compare them.\r\n\r\n“This, however, does not often occur, and never, I believe, except at\r\nthe commencement of the disease. The patients, in general, are capable\r\nof standing and walking, and many, after it has continued a short time,\r\ncan attend to their business, provided it is not of a nature requiring\r\nmuch steadiness of body. They are incapable of conversing with any\r\ndegree of satisfaction to themselves or company, being continually\r\ninterrupted by those irregular contractions of their muscles, each\r\ncausing a grunt, or forcible expiration; but the organs of speech do\r\nnot appear to be affected, nor has it the least influence on the mind.\r\nThey have no command over their actions by any effort of volition, nor\r\ndoes their lying in bed prevent them, but they always cease during\r\nsleep. This disease has remissions and exacerbations, which, however,\r\nobserve no regularity in their occurrence or duration. During the\r\nintermission a paroxysm is often excited at the sight of a person\r\naffected, but more frequently by the common salute of shaking hands.\r\nThe sensations of the patients in a paroxysm are generally agreeable,\r\nwhich the enthusiastic class often endeavour to express, by laughing,\r\nshouting, _dancing_, &c.\r\n\r\n“Fatigue is almost always complained of after violent paroxysms, and\r\nsometimes a general soreness is experienced. The heart and arteries\r\nappear to be no further affected by the disease, than what arises from\r\nthe exercise of the body; nor does any change take place in any of the\r\nsecretions or excretions. It has not proved mortal in a single instance\r\nwithin my knowledge, but becomes lighter by degrees, and finally\r\ndisappears. In some cases, however, of long continuance, it is attended\r\nwith some degree of melancholia, which seems to arise entirely from the\r\npatient’s reflections, and not directly from the disease.\r\n\r\n“The state of the atmosphere has no influence over it, as it rages with\r\nequal violence in summer and in winter; in moist and in dry air.”\r\n\r\nIn the above examples, nervous disorders bearing a strong resemblance\r\nto those of the middle ages, are shown to exist in an _epidemic_\r\nform, both in Europe and America, at the present time; but in these\r\ninstances some general cause of mental excitement—and none is more\r\npowerful than religious enthusiasm—seems to have been requisite for\r\ntheir propagation. Their appearance, however, in _single cases_, is\r\noccasionally independent of any such origin, which leads to a belief,\r\nnot without support in the experiments of modern physiologists,\r\nthat they occasionally proceed from physical causes, and that it is\r\ntherefore not necessary to consider them in all cases as the offspring\r\nof a disordered imagination.\r\n\r\nA well marked case of a disease approximating to the original\r\nDancing Mania, is related by Mr. Kinder Wood, in the 7th volume of\r\nthe Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, p. 237. The patient, a young\r\nmarried woman, is described to have suffered from headache and\r\nsickness, together with involuntary motions of the eyelids, and most\r\nextraordinary contortions of the trunk and extremities, for several\r\ndays, when the more remarkable symptoms began to manifest themselves,\r\nwhich are thus recorded:—\r\n\r\n“February 26. Slight motions of the limbs came on in bed. She arose\r\nat nine o’clock, after which they increased, and became unusually\r\nsevere. She was hurled from side to side of the couch-chair upon which\r\nshe sat, for a considerable time, without intermission; was sometimes\r\ninstantaneously and forcibly thrown upon her feet, when she jumped\r\nand stamped violently. She had headache; the eyelids were frequently\r\naffected, and she had often a sudden propensity to spring or leap\r\nupwards. The affection ceased about eleven o’clock in the forenoon,\r\nthe patient being very much fatigued; but it returned about noon, and\r\na third time in the afternoon, when she was impelled into every corner\r\nof the room, and began to strike the furniture and doors violently with\r\nthe hand, as she passed near them, the sound of which afforded her\r\ngreat satisfaction. The fourth attack was at night; was very violent,\r\nand ended with sickness and vomiting. She went to bed at half-past\r\neleven. Her nights were invariably good. The last three attacks were\r\nmore violent than the former ones, but they continued only half an hour\r\neach.\r\n\r\n“February 27. The attack commenced in bed, and was violent, but of\r\nshort duration. When she arose about ten, she had a second attack,\r\ncontinuing an hour, except an interval of five minutes. She now struck\r\nthe furniture more violently and more repeatedly. Kneeling on one\r\nknee, with the hands upon the back, she often sprang up suddenly and\r\nstruck the top of the room with the palm of the hand. To do this, she\r\nrose fifteen inches from the floor, so that the family were under the\r\nnecessity of drawing all the nails and hooks from the ceiling. She\r\nfrequently danced upon one leg, holding the other with the hand, and\r\noccasionally changing the legs. In the evening, the family observed\r\nthe blows upon the furniture to be more continuous, and to assume\r\nthe regular time and measure of a musical air. As a strain or series\r\nof strokes was concluded, she ended with a more violent stroke or a\r\nmore violent spring or jump. Several of her friends also at this time\r\nnoticed the regular measure of the strokes, and the greater regularity\r\nthe disease was assuming; the motions being evidently affected, or in\r\nsome measure modified by the strokes upon the surrounding bodies. She\r\nchiefly struck a small slender door, the top of a chest of drawers, the\r\nclock, a table, or a wooden screen placed near the door. The affection\r\nceased about nine o’clock, when the patient went to bed.\r\n\r\n“February 28. She arose very well at eight. At half-past nine the\r\nmotions recommenced; they were now of a more pleasant nature; the\r\ninvoluntary actions, instead of possessing their former irregularity\r\nand violence, being changed into a measured step over the room,\r\nconnected with an air, or series of strokes, and she beat upon the\r\nadjacent bodies as she passed them. In the commencement of the\r\nattack, the lips moved as if words were articulated, but no sound\r\ncould be distinguished at this period. It was curious indeed to\r\nobserve the patient at this time, moving around the room with all the\r\nvivacity of the country dance, or the graver step of the minuet, the\r\narms frequently carried, not merely with ease, but with elegance.\r\nOccasionally all the steps were so directed as to place the foot\r\nconstantly where the stone flags joined to form the floor, particularly\r\nwhen she looked downwards. When she looked upwards, there was an\r\nirresistible impulse to spring up to touch little spots or holes in\r\nthe top of the ceiling; when she looked around, she had a similar\r\npropensity to dart the forefinger into little holes in the furniture,\r\n&c. One hole in the wooden screen received the point of the forefinger\r\nmany hundred times, which was suddenly and involuntarily darted into it\r\nwith an amazing rapidity and precision. There was one particular part\r\nof the wall to which she frequently danced, and there placing herself\r\nwith the back to it, stood two or three minutes. This by the family was\r\ncalled ‘_the measuring place_.’\r\n\r\n“In the afternoon the motions returned, and proceeded much as in the\r\nmorning. At this time a person present, surprised at the manner in\r\nwhich she beat upon the doors, &c., and thinking he recognised the\r\nair, without further ceremony began to sing the tune; the moment this\r\nstruck her ears, she turned suddenly to the man, and dancing directly\r\nup to him, continued doing so till he was out of breath. The man now\r\nceased a short time, when commencing again, he continued till the\r\nattack stopped. The night before this, her father had mentioned his\r\nwish to procure a drum, associating this dance of his daughter with\r\nsome ideas of music. The avidity with which she danced to the tune\r\nwhen sung as above stated, confirmed this wish, and accordingly a drum\r\nand fife were procured in the evening. After two hours of rest, the\r\nmotions again reappeared, when the drum and fife began to play the air\r\nto which she had danced before, viz. the ‘Protestant Boys,’ a favourite\r\npopular air in this neighbourhood. In whatever part of the room she\r\nhappened to be, she immediately turned and danced up to the drum, and\r\nas close as possible to it, and there she danced till she missed the\r\nstep, when the involuntary motions instantly ceased. The first time she\r\nmissed the step in five minutes; but again rose, and danced to the drum\r\ntwo minutes and a half by her father’s watch, when, missing the step,\r\nthe motions instantly ceased. She rose a third time, and missing the\r\nstep in half a minute, the motions immediately ceased. After this, the\r\ndrum and fife commenced as the involuntary actions were coming on, and\r\nbefore she rose from her seat; and four times they completely checked\r\nthe progress of the attack, so that she did not rise upon the floor to\r\ndance. At this period the affection ceased for the evening.\r\n\r\n“March 1. She arose very well at half-past seven. Upon my visit this\r\nmorning, the circumstances of the preceding afternoon being stated, it\r\nappeared clear to me, that the attacks had been shortened. Slow as I\r\nhad seen the effects of medicine in the comparatively trifling disease\r\nof young females, I was very willing that the family should pursue the\r\nexperiment, whilst the medical means were continued.\r\n\r\n“As I wished to see the effect of the instrument over the disease, I\r\nwas sent for at noon, when I found her dancing to the drum, which she\r\ncontinued to do for half an hour without missing the step, owing to the\r\nslowness of the movement. As I sat counting the pulse, which I found\r\nto be 120, in the short intervals of an attack, I noticed motions of\r\nthe lips, previous to the commencement of the dance, and placing my\r\near near the mouth I distinguished a tune. After the attack of which\r\nthis was the beginning, she informed me, in answer to my inquiry, that\r\nthere always was a tune dwelling upon her mind, which at times becoming\r\nmore pressing, irresistibly impelled her to commence the involuntary\r\nmotions. The motions ceased at four o’clock.\r\n\r\n“At half-past seven the motions commenced again, when I was sent for.\r\nThere were two drummers present, and an unbraced drum was beaten till\r\nthe other was braced. She danced regularly to the unbraced drum, but\r\nthe moment the other commenced she instantly ceased. As missing the\r\ntime stopped the affections, I wished the measure to be changed during\r\nthe dance, which stopped the attack. It also ceased upon increasing\r\nthe rapidity of the beat, till she could no longer keep time; and it\r\nwas truly surprising to see the rapidity and violence of the muscular\r\nexertion, in order to keep time with the increasing movement of the\r\ninstrument. Five times I saw her sit down the same evening, at the\r\ninstant that she was unable to keep the measure; and in consequence\r\nof this I desired the drummers to beat one continued roll, instead\r\nof a regular movement. She arose and danced five minutes, when both\r\ndrums beat a continued roll: the motions instantly stopped, and the\r\npatient sat down. In a few minutes the motions commencing again, she\r\nwas suffered to dance five minutes, when the drums again began to\r\nroll, the effect of which was instantaneous; the motions ceased, and\r\nthe patient sat down. In a few minutes the same was repeated with the\r\nsame effect. It appeared certain that the attacks could now be stopped\r\nin an instant, and I was desirous of arresting them entirely, and\r\nbreaking the chain of irregular associations which constituted the\r\ndisease. As the motions at this period always commenced in the fingers,\r\nand propagated themselves along the upper extremities to the trunk, I\r\ndesired the drummers, when the patient arose to dance, to watch the\r\ncommencement of the attack, and roll the drums before she arose from\r\nthe chair. Six times successively the patient was hindered from rising,\r\nby attending to the commencement of the affection; and before leaving\r\nthe house, I desired the family to attend to the commencement of the\r\nattacks, and use the drum early.\r\n\r\n“March 2. She arose at seven o’clock, and the motions commenced at\r\nten; she danced twice before the drummer was prepared, after which\r\nshe attempted to dance again four several times; but one roll of a\r\nwell-braced drum hindered the patient from leaving her seat, after\r\nwhich the attacks did not recur. She was left weakly and fatigued by\r\nthe disease, but with a good appetite. In the evening of this day an\r\neruption appeared, particularly about the elbows, in diffused patches\r\nof a bright red colour, which went off on the third day.”\r\n\r\nOther cases might be adduced, (see 23d vol. of the Edinburgh Medical\r\nand Surgical Journal, p. 261; 31st vol. of ditto, p. 299; 5th vol. of\r\nthe Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, pp. 1 to 23, &c.,) but as there\r\nis none more striking than this, they would unnecessarily swell this\r\nnumber of the Appendix, which has already extended to an undue length.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VI.\r\n\r\n                 MUSIC FOR THE DANCE OF THE TARANTATI,\r\n                                 FROM\r\n                            ATHAN.

Extravagant as the    |\r\n| love of dress was after the middle of the fourteenth century,        |\r\n| the opposition of the enemies of fashion was equally great, and      |\r\n| they let slip no opportunity of crying down every change or          |\r\n| innovation as the work of the devil. Hence it is extremely probable  |\r\n| that the fanatic penitential sermons of zealous priests excited      |\r\n| this singular aversion of the St. Vitus dancers. In later times      |\r\n| also, signs and wonders took place, on account of things equally     |\r\n| insignificant, and the fury of the possessed was directed against    |\r\n| the fashions.

It is so       |\r\n| called for that the parties so troubled were wont to go to St.       |\r\n| Vitus for help; and, after they had danced there awhile, they were   |\r\n| certainly freed. ’Tis strange to hear how long they will dance,      |\r\n| and in what manner, over stools, forms, tables; even great bellied   |\r\n| women sometimes (and yet never hurt their children) will dance       |\r\n| so long that they can stir neither hand nor foot, but seem to be     |\r\n| quite dead. One in red clothes they cannot abide.

From which we shall merely add that Mazara, in Sicily, is       |\r\n| supposed to have been the birth-place of our Saint, and that         |\r\n| his father’s name was _Hylas_; that he went from thence with         |\r\n| _Crescentia_ (probably his nurse) and _Modestus_ to Lucania, with    |\r\n| both of whom he suffered martyrdom under _Diocletian_. They are all  |\r\n| said to have been buried at Florence, and it was not long before     |\r\n| the miraculous powers of St. Vitus, which had already manifested     |\r\n| themselves in his life-time, were acknowledged throughout Italy.     |\r\n| The most celebrated of his chapels were situated on the Promontory   |\r\n| of Sicily (called by his name), in Rome and in Polignano, whither    |\r\n| many pilgrimages were made by the sick. Persons who had been bitten  |\r\n| by mad dogs believed that they would find an infallible cure at      |\r\n| his altars, though the power of the Saint in curing wounds of this   |\r\n| kind was afterwards disputed by the followers of St. Hubertus, the   |\r\n| Saint of the Chase. In 672, his body was with much pomp moved to     |\r\n| Apulia, but soon after the priests of many churches and chapels      |\r\n| in Italy, gave out that they were in possession of portions of       |\r\n| the saint’s body which worked miracles. In the eighth century the    |\r\n| veneration of this youthful martyr extended itself to France, and    |\r\n| the honour of possessing his body was conferred on the church of     |\r\n| St. Denys. By command of the Pope it was solemnly delivered on       |\r\n| the 19th of March, 836, by the Abbot _Hilduwinus_, of St. Denys,     |\r\n| to the Abbot _Warinus_, of Corvey, (founded in 822). On its way      |\r\n| thither, which occupied three months (to the 13th of June), many     |\r\n| miracles were performed, and the subsequent Abbots of Corvey were    |\r\n| able for centuries to maintain the popular belief in the miraculous  |\r\n| healing power of their relics, which had indiscriminate influence    |\r\n| on all diseases, more especially on those of a demoniacal kind.

(Quæstiones in IV. Libr. Regum. Interrogat. 47, p. 352. _Beati    |\r\n| Theodoreti_, Episcop. Cyri Opera omnia, Ed. _Jac. Sirmondi_, Lùt.    |\r\n| Paris. 1642. fol. T.

That such different nations should have had the same idea of     |\r\n| fixing the purification by fire on St. John’s day, is a remarkable   |\r\n| coincidence, which perhaps can be accounted for only by its analogy  |\r\n| to baptism.                                                          |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [224] The Life and Adventures of _Nathaniel Pearce_, written by      |\r\n| himself, during a residence in Abyssinia from the year 1810 to       |\r\n| 1819.

L. VII. c.   |\r\n| 26. In _Reiske_, loc. cit. p. 77.) Bones, horns, and other rubbish,  |\r\n| were heaped together to be consumed in smoke, while persons of all   |\r\n| ages danced round the flames as if they had been possessed, in the   |\r\n| same way as at the Palilia, an ancient Roman lustration by fire,     |\r\n| whereat those who took part in them, sprang through a fire made of   |\r\n| straw. (Ovid. Met. XIV. 774. Fast. IV. 721.)

They        |\r\n| successively relieved each other; and this singular mode of cure     |\r\n| lasted above four weeks, when the patient fell down exhausted, and   |\r\n| being quite unable to stand, was carried to an hospital, where       |\r\n| she recovered. She had remained in her clothes all the time,         |\r\n| and, entirely regardless of the pain of her lacerated feet, she      |\r\n| had merely sat down occasionally to take some nourishment, or to     |\r\n| slumber, during which the hopping movement of her body continued.    |\r\n| _Felic.

The patient’s name was       |\r\n| Christian Shaw, a girl of eleven years of age. She is described      |\r\n| as having had violent fits of leaping, dancing, running, crying,     |\r\n| fainting, &c., but the whole narrative is mixed up with so much      |\r\n| credulity and superstition, that it is impossible to separate truth  |\r\n| from fiction. These strange fits continued from August, 1696,        |\r\n| till the end of March in the year following, when the patient        |\r\n| recovered.” An account of the whole was published at Edinburgh,      |\r\n| in 1698, entitled, “A true Narrative of the Sufferings of a Young    |\r\n| Girl, who was strangely molested by evil spirits, and their          |\r\n| instruments, in the West, collected from authentic testimonies.”     |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| The whole being ascribed to witchcraft, the clergy were most active  |\r\n| on the occasion. Besides occasional days of humiliation, two solemn  |\r\n| fasts were observed throughout the whole bounds of the Presbytery,   |\r\n| and a number of clergymen and elders were appointed in rotation, to  |\r\n| be constantly on the spot. So far the matter was well enough. But    |\r\n| such was the superstition of the age, that a memorial was presented  |\r\n| to his Majesty’s most honourable Privy Council, and on the 19th      |\r\n| of January, 1697, a warrant was issued, setting forth “that there    |\r\n| were pregnant grounds of suspicion of witchcraft in Renfrewshire,    |\r\n| especially from the afflicted and extraordinary condition of         |\r\n| Christian Shaw, daughter of John Shaw, of Bargarran.” A commission   |\r\n| was therefore granted to Alexander Lord Blantyre, Sir John Maxwell,  |\r\n| Sir John Shaw, and five others, together with the sheriff of the     |\r\n| county, to inquire into the matter, and report. This commission is   |\r\n| signed by eleven privy councillors, consisting of some of the first  |\r\n| noblemen and gentlemen in the kingdom.                               |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| The report of the commissioners having fully confirmed the           |\r\n| suspicions respecting the existence of witchcraft, another warrant   |\r\n| was issued on the 5th of April, 1697, to Lord Hallcraig, Sir         |\r\n| John Houston, and four others, “to try the persons accused of        |\r\n| witchcraft, and to sentence the guilty to be burned, or otherwise    |\r\n| executed to death, as the commission should incline.”                |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| The commissioners, thus empowered, were not remiss in the discharge  |\r\n| of their duty. After twenty hours were spent in the examination      |\r\n| of witnesses, and counsel heard on both sides, the counsel for       |\r\n| the prosecution “exhorted the jury to beware of condemning the       |\r\n| innocent; but at the same time, should they acquit the prisoners in  |\r\n| opposition to legal evidence, they would be accessory to all the     |\r\n| blasphemies, apostacies, murders, tortures, and seductions, whereof  |\r\n| these enemies of heaven and earth should hereafter be guilty.”       |\r\n| After the jury had spent six hours in deliberation, seven of the     |\r\n| miserable wretches, three men and four women, were condemned to      |\r\n| the flames, and the sentence faithfully executed at Paisley, on      |\r\n| the 10th of June, 1697.—_Medico-Chirurg.

Some make a doubt   |\r\n| of it, whether there be any such disease. _Donat. ab Altomari_       |\r\n| (Cap. 9. Art. Med.) saith, that he saw two of them in his time:      |\r\n| _Wierus_ (De Præstig. Demonum, 1. 3. cap. 21.) tells a story of      |\r\n| such a one at Padua, 1541, that would not believe to the contrary,   |\r\n| but that he was a wolf. He hath another instance of a Spaniard, who  |\r\n| thought himself a bear. _Forestus_ (Observat. lib. 10. de Morbis     |\r\n| Cerebri, c. 15.) confirms as much by many examples; one, among the   |\r\n| rest, of which he was an eye-witness, at Alcmaer in Holland.—A poor  |\r\n| husbandman that still hunted about graves, and kept in churchyards,  |\r\n| of a pale, black, ugly, and fearful look. Such, belike, or little    |\r\n| better, were king Prœtus’ daughters, (_Hippocrates_ lib. de          |\r\n| insaniâ,) that thought themselves kine: and Nebuchadnezzar, in       |\r\n| Daniel, as some interpreters hold, was only troubled with this       |\r\n| kind of madness. This disease, perhaps, gave occasion to that bold   |\r\n| assertion of Pliny, (Lib. 8. cap. 22. homines interdum lupos fieri;  |\r\n| et contra,) _some men were turned into wolves in his time, and from  |\r\n| wolves to men again_; and to that fable of Pausanias, of a man that  |\r\n| was ten years a wolf, and afterwards turned to his former shape; to  |\r\n| Ovid’s (Met. lib. 1.) tale of Lycaon, &c. He that is desirous to     |\r\n| hear of this disease, or more examples, let him read _Austin_ in     |\r\n| his eighteenth book, _de Civitate Dei_, cap. 5; _Mizaldus_, cent.    |\r\n| 5. 77; _Schenkius_, lib. 1. _Hildesheim, Spicil. 2. de maniâ_;       |\r\n| Forestus, lib. 10. _de morbis cerebri; Olaus Magnus; Vicentius       |\r\n| Bellavicensis, spec. met._ lib. 31. c. 122; _Pierius, Bodine,        |\r\n| Zuinger, Zeilgur, Peucer, Wierus, Spranger, &c._ This malady, saith  |\r\n| _Avicenna_, troubleth men most in February, and is now-a-days        |\r\n| frequent in Bohemia and Hungary, according to _Heurnius_. (Cap. de   |\r\n| Man.) _Schernitzius_ will have it common in Livonia. They lie hid,   |\r\n| most part, all day, and go abroad in the night, barking, howling,    |\r\n| at graves and deserts; _they have usually hollow eyes, scabbed legs  |\r\n| and thighs, very dry and pale_, (Ulcerata crura; sitis ipsis adest   |\r\n| immodica; pallidi; lingua sicca,) saith _Altomarus_: he gives a      |\r\n| reason there of all the symptoms, and sets down a brief cure of      |\r\n| them.”—_Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy._ Tenth Edit.: 8vo. 1804.     |\r\n| Vol. 1.

Hence in orphan       |\r\n| asylums, hospitals, and convents, the nervous disorder of one        |\r\n| female so easily and quickly becomes the disorder of all. I have     |\r\n| read in a good medical work that a nun, in a very large convent      |\r\n| in France, began to mew like a cat; shortly afterwards other nuns    |\r\n| also mewed. At last all the nuns mewed together every day at a       |\r\n| certain time for several hours together. The whole surrounding       |\r\n| Christian neighbourhood heard, with equal chagrin and astonishment,  |\r\n| this daily cat-concert, which did not cease until all the nuns       |\r\n| were informed that a company of soldiers were placed by the police   |\r\n| before the entrance of the convent, and that they were provided      |\r\n| with rods, and would continue whipping them until they promised not  |\r\n| to mew any more.                                                     |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| “But of all the epidemics of females which I myself have seen        |\r\n| in Germany, or of which the history is known to me, the most         |\r\n| remarkable is the celebrated Convent-epidemic of the fifteenth       |\r\n| century, which Cardan describes, and which peculiarly proves         |\r\n| what I would here enforce. A nun in a German nunnery fell to         |\r\n| biting all her companions. In the course of a short time all the     |\r\n| nuns of this convent began biting each other. The news of this       |\r\n| infatuation among the nuns soon spread, and it now passed from       |\r\n| convent to convent, throughout a great part of Germany, principally  |\r\n| Saxony and Brandenburg. It afterwards visited the nunneries of       |\r\n| Holland, and at last the nuns had the biting mania even as far as    |\r\n| Rome.”—_Zimmermann_ on Solitude, Vol. II.

This sect, according to the    |\r\n| testimony of modern writers, continues to exhibit the same strange   |\r\n| spectacles as the ancient serpent-eaters of Cyrene, described by     |\r\n| Strabo, 17 Dio. 51. c. 14. Lucan, 9. v. 894. 937. Herodot. 4. c.     |\r\n| 173. Paus. 9. c. 28. Savary states that he witnessed a procession    |\r\n| at Rosetta, where a band of these seeming madmen, with bare arms     |\r\n| and wild demeanour, held enormous serpents in their hands which      |\r\n| writhed round their bodies and endeavoured to make their escape.     |\r\n| These Psylli, grasping them by the neck, tore them with their teeth  |\r\n| and ate them up alive, the blood streaming down from their polluted  |\r\n| mouths. Others of the Psylli were striving to wrest their prey from  |\r\n| them, so that it seemed a struggle among them who should devour a    |\r\n| serpent. The populace followed them with amazement, and believed     |\r\n| their performance to be miraculous. Accordingly they pass for        |\r\n| persons inspired, and possessed by a spirit who destroys the effect  |\r\n| of the serpent.                                                      |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| Sonnini, though not so fortunate as to witness a public exhibition   |\r\n| of such performances, yet gives the following interesting account    |\r\n| of what he justly calls a remarkable specimen of the extravagance    |\r\n| of man. After adverting to the superstitious origin of the sect,     |\r\n| he goes on to say that a Saadi, or serpent-eater, came to his        |\r\n| apartment accompanied by a priest of his sect. The priest carried    |\r\n| in his bosom a large serpent of a dusky green and copper colour,     |\r\n| which he was continually handling; and after having recited a        |\r\n| prayer, he delivered it to the Saadi. The narrative proceeds:—“With  |\r\n| a vigorous hand the Saadi seized the serpent, which twisted itself   |\r\n| round his naked arm. He began to appear agitated; his countenance    |\r\n| was discomposed; his eyes rolled; he uttered terrible cries, bit     |\r\n| the animal in the head, and tore off a morsel, which we saw him      |\r\n| chew and swallow. On this his agitation became convulsive; his       |\r\n| howlings were redoubled, his limbs writhed, his countenance assumed  |\r\n| the features of madness, and his mouth, extended by terrible         |\r\n| grimaces, was all in a foam. Every now and then he devoured a fresh  |\r\n| morsel of the reptile. Three men endeavoured to hold him, but he     |\r\n| dragged them all three round the chamber. His arms were thrown       |\r\n| about with violence on all sides, and struck every thing within      |\r\n| their reach. Eager to avoid him, M. Forneti and I were obliged       |\r\n| sometimes to cling to the wall, to let him pass and escape his       |\r\n| blows. We could have wished the madman far away. At length the       |\r\n| priest took the serpent from him, but his madness and convulsions    |\r\n| did not cease immediately; he bit his hands, and his fury            |\r\n| continued. The priest then grasped him in his arms, passed his hand  |\r\n| gently down his back, lifted him from the ground, and recited some   |\r\n| prayers. By degrees his agitation diminished, and subsided into a    |\r\n| state of complete lassitude, in which he remained a few moments.     |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| “The Turks who were present at this ridiculous and disgusting        |\r\n| ceremony were firmly persuaded of the reality of this religious      |\r\n| fury; and it is very certain that, whether it were reality or        |\r\n| imposture, it is impossible to see the transports of rage and        |\r\n| madness exhibited in a more striking manner, or have before          |\r\n| your eyes a man more calculated to inspire terror.”—_Hunter’s        |\r\n| Translation of Sonnini’s Travels_, 8vo. 1799.—_Transl. note._        |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [313] _Franc.

I was told that it was some dervise or monk,       |\r\n| who repeated, while _dancing_ on his heels, the name of Allah,       |\r\n| till, completely exhausted, he sank down insensible.

Rien     |\r\n| de plus curieux que le spectacle des Schekhs, qui, dans les fêtes    |\r\n| publiques, s’essayent à l’envi, et hurlent le nom d’Allah d’une      |\r\n| manière effrayante.

The history of the world bears indisputable\r\ntestimony to this fact. The tendencies of the mind, the turn of thought\r\nof whole ages, have frequently depended on prevailing diseases; for\r\nnothing exercises a more potent influence over man, either in disposing\r\nhim to calmness and submission, or in kindling in him the wildest\r\npassions, than the proximity of inevitable and universal danger. Often\r\nhave infatuation and fanaticism, hatred and revenge, engendered by\r\nan overwhelming fear of death, spread fire and flames throughout the\r\nworld. Famine and diseases, among which may be instanced the fiery\r\nplague of St. Anthony, were no less powerful in calling forth the\r\nchivalrous spirit of the crusades than the enthusiastic eloquence of\r\nPeter the Hermit—the Black Death brought thousands to the stake, and\r\naroused the fearful penances of the Flagellants—while the oriental\r\nleprosy cast a gloomy shade over society throughout the whole course of\r\nthe middle ages.\r\n\r\nWith all such commotions, the most striking events of the world are\r\nin intimate relation, and unquestionably, amid the changing forms of\r\nexistence in the human race, more has always depended on the prevailing\r\ntone of thought than on the rude powers by which those events were\r\nproduced. The historian, therefore, who would investigate the hidden\r\ninfluence of mind, cannot dispense with medical research. The facts\r\nthemselves convince him of the organic union of the corporeal and the\r\nspiritual in all human affairs, and consequently of the innate vital\r\nconnexion of all human knowledge. Hence, in a medical point of view,\r\nhow vast is the field for observation presented by the history of\r\npopular diseases. Present bodily sufferings[348], are, collectively,\r\nbut a step in the development,—but one phase of morbid life amid a\r\nlong series of phenomena, and hence are not fully understood without\r\na previous knowledge of the past, and historical research. How can we\r\nrecognise the ring of Saturn as such, so long as our axis of vision\r\nis in its plane, and we see it only as a line. Great pestilences\r\nhave vanished or been dispersed; from causes apparently the most\r\ninsignificant, the most important consequences have resulted, and\r\nthroughout the vicissitudes of danger and devastation, the operations\r\nof mighty laws of nature are everywhere manifested in the social\r\ntendencies of entire centuries.\r\n\r\nThis is no aërial realm of transitory conjectures—facts themselves\r\nspeak in a thousand reminiscences. If we do but investigate the\r\npast with unprejudiced assiduity—if we do but consider even the few\r\nsuccessful researches which have hitherto been made in historical\r\npathology, (perhaps those who are kindly disposed will recognise even\r\nmine,) we shall not fail to arrive at a centre of reality, which\r\nthe healing art, to its great detriment, has hitherto been far from\r\nreaching, whilst it has occasionally penetrated into a less fertile\r\nsoil, or even encumbered itself with the accumulated rubbish of the\r\npedantic dogmas of the schools.\r\n\r\nThe state, which founds its legislation on a knowledge of realities,\r\nwhich expects from the physical sciences information respecting human\r\nlife collectively, considered in all its relations, has a right to\r\ndemand from its physicians a general insight into the nature and\r\ncauses of popular diseases. Such an insight, however, as is worthy\r\nthe dignity of a science, cannot be obtained by the observation of\r\nisolated epidemics, because nature never in any one of them displays\r\nherself in all her bearings, nor brings into action, at one time, more\r\nthan a few of the laws of general disease. One generation, however\r\nrich it may be in stores of important knowledge, is never adequate to\r\nestablish, on the foundation of actually observed phenomena, a doctrine\r\nof popular diseases worthy of the name. The experience of all ages is\r\nthe source whence we must in this case draw, and medical investigation\r\nis the only road which leads to this source, unless, indeed, we would\r\nbe unprepared to meet new epidemics, and would maintain the unfounded\r\nopinion that medical science, as it now exists, is the full result of\r\nall preceding efforts.\r\n\r\nAn insight, not only into general visitations of disease, which in\r\nthe course of ages have appeared in divers forms, but also into every\r\nsingle disease, whether it occurs in intimate connexion with others\r\nor not, is rendered more distinct by a knowledge of the contemporary\r\ncircumstances which attend its development. I would fain hope,\r\ntherefore, that the future research and diligence of physicians devoted\r\nto the pursuit of truth and science, will be more generally directed\r\nto historical investigation; and that universities and academies will\r\nconcede to it that prominent place, which, from its high importance, as\r\nan extensive branch of natural philosophy, it justly demands.\r\n\r\nWhether the following inquiry into one of the most remarkable diseases\r\non record corresponds with these views, I must leave my readers to\r\njudge. The historian will discern what social feelings are produced\r\namong nations by great events, and to the physician a picture of\r\nsuffering will be unveiled, to which the diseases of the present time\r\nafford no parallel. I have throughout kept in view the spirit and the\r\ndignity of the sixteenth century, which was as remarkable for military\r\ntriumphs as for tragic events; and I look with confidence for the same\r\nindulgence and goodwill now, which, through the kindness of friends, I\r\nhave already enjoyed both at home and abroad, in a higher degree than\r\nmy sincere gratitude can find words to express.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE SWEATING SICKNESS.\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n               THE FIRST VISITATION OF THE DISEASE—1485.\r\n\r\n    “Sound drums and trumpets, boldly and cheerfully,\r\n     God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!”—SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECT. 1.—ERUPTION.\r\n\r\nAfter the fate of England had been decided by the battle of Bosworth,\r\non the 22d of August, 1485[349], the joy of the nation was clouded\r\nby a mortal disease which thinned the ranks of the warriors, and\r\nfollowing in the rear of Henry’s victorious army, spread in a few weeks\r\nfrom the distant mountains of Wales to the metropolis of the empire.\r\nIt was a violent inflammatory fever, which, after a short rigor,\r\nprostrated the powers as with a blow; and amidst painful oppression\r\nat the stomach, headache and lethargic stupor, suffused the whole\r\nbody with a fetid perspiration. All this took place in the course of\r\na few hours, and the crisis was always over within the space of a\r\nday and night[350]. The internal heat which the patient suffered was\r\nintolerable, yet every refrigerant was certain death. The people were\r\nseized with consternation when they saw that scarcely one in a hundred\r\nescaped[351], and their first impression was that a reign commencing\r\nwith such horrors would doubtless prove most inauspicious[352].\r\n\r\nAt first the new foe was scarcely heeded; citizens and peasants went\r\nin joyful processions to meet the victorious army. Henry’s march from\r\nBosworth towards London resembled a triumph, which was everywhere\r\ncelebrated by festivals; for the nation, after its many years of civil\r\nwar, looked forward to happier days than they had enjoyed under the\r\nblood-thirsty Richard.\r\n\r\nVery shortly, however, after the king’s entry into the capital on\r\nthe 28th of August[353], the Sweating Sickness[354], as the disease\r\nwas called, began to spread its ravages among the densely peopled\r\nstreets of the city. Two lord mayors and six aldermen died within one\r\nweek[355], having scarcely laid aside their festive robes; many who\r\nhad been in perfect health at night, were on the following morning\r\nnumbered among the dead. The disease for the most part marked for its\r\nvictims robust and vigorous men; and as many noble families lost their\r\nchiefs, extensive commercial houses their principals, and wards their\r\nguardians, the festivities were soon converted into grief and mourning.\r\nThe coronation of the king, which was expected to overcome the scruples\r\nthat many entertained of his right to the throne, was of necessity\r\npostponed in this general distress[356], and the disease, in the mean\r\ntime, spread without interruption and over the whole kingdom from east\r\nto west[357].\r\n\r\nIt is agreed that the pestilence did not commence till the very\r\nbeginning of August, 1485, and was in obvious connexion with the\r\ncircumstances of the times. To return to their native country had\r\nlong been the ardent desire of the Earl of Richmond and his faithful\r\nfollowers. At the age of 15, (1471,) having escaped the vengeance of\r\nthe House of York, and the assassins of Edward, he was overtaken by\r\na storm, and fell into the hands of Francis II., Duke of Bretagne,\r\nwho long detained him prisoner, but on the death of Edward, in 1483,\r\nsupplied him with means to enforce his claims to the English throne, as\r\nthe last descendant of the House of Lancaster. This first undertaking\r\nmiscarried. A storm drove back the bold adventurer to Dieppe, and\r\ncompelled him once more to throw himself, with his five hundred English\r\nfollowers, on the hospitality of Duke Francis. Richard’s influence\r\nwith the Duke, however, rendered his stay there somewhat dangerous.\r\nRichmond withdrew privately, and endeavoured to gain over to his cause\r\nCharles VIII., who was yet a minor. A small subsidy of French troops,\r\nsome pieces of artillery, and an adequate supply of money, were finally\r\ngranted to his repeated solicitations. This little band was quickly\r\naugmented to 2000 men, who were all embarked, and on the 25th of July,\r\n1485, they weighed anchor at Havre, and seven days after, the standard\r\nof Richmond was raised in Milford Haven[358].\r\n\r\nThey landed at the village of Dale, on the west side of the harbour,\r\nand on the evening of their arrival, or very early on the following\r\nmorning, Richmond hastened to Haverfordwest, where no messenger had\r\nyet announced the renewal of the civil war. It appears that he reached\r\nCardigan, on the northern shore, on the 3d of August, and for the\r\nfirst time granted to his small but increasing army the repose of an\r\nencampment.\r\n\r\nAfter a short halt, he set forward with confidence, crossed the Severn\r\nat Shrewsbury[359], turned from thence to Newport and Stafford,\r\nand pitched his camp at Litchfield, probably before the 18th of\r\nAugust[360]. The distance to this place from Milford Haven is 170\r\nmiles, and the road leads over wooded mountains and cultivated fields,\r\nwithout touching upon any swampy lands. Litchfield, however, lies low,\r\nand it was here that the army encamped in a damp situation, till it\r\nbroke up for the neighbouring field of Bosworth. Thither Richmond, with\r\nscarcely 5000 men, and having his right wing covered by a morass, went\r\nto meet his deadly foe, whose army doubled his own. The combat was at\r\nfirst furious, but in two hours Lord Stanley crowned the conqueror with\r\nRichard’s diadem[361].\r\n\r\nAll these events so rapidly succeeded each other in the course of\r\nthree weeks, that the knights and soldiers of Richmond, more and\r\nmore excited every day by fear and hope, were scarcely equal to such\r\nexertions. Yet the very rapidity of the movements of the army was the\r\ncause why the disease could not spread so quickly, nor obstruct the\r\nfinal decision of Bosworth, although the report of it had already,\r\nbefore this event, spread universal terror; so that Lord Stanley, when\r\nauthoritatively summoned by Richard to repair to his standard, sought\r\nto gain time, and, by way of excuse, alleged the prevalence of the new\r\ndisease[362].\r\n\r\nAfter the victory of Bosworth, King Henry remained two days in\r\nLeicester, and then without further delay hastened to London, which he\r\nreached in less than four days, unaccompanied by military parade, and\r\nattended only by a select body of followers. The remainder of his army,\r\nwhich stood greatly in need of repose after its severe toils, were not\r\nin a condition for marching, they therefore halted in the neighbouring\r\ntowns, and were probably disbanded, according to the custom of the\r\nage[363].\r\n\r\nThe Sweating Sickness is said not to have made its appearance in London\r\ntill the 21st of September[364], but historians have most likely\r\nintended by that day to mark the commencement of its virulence, which\r\ncontinued to the end of the following month, and lasted, therefore, in\r\nall, about five weeks.\r\n\r\nDuring this short period a large portion of the population[365] fell\r\nvictims to the new epidemic, and the lamentation was without bounds\r\nso long as the people were ignorant that this fearful disease, unable\r\nto establish its dominion, would only pass through the country like a\r\nflash of lightning, and then again give place to the active intercourse\r\nof society and the cheering hope of life.\r\n\r\nThere was no security against a second attack; for many who had\r\nrecovered were seized by it, with equal violence, a second, and\r\nsometimes a third time, so that they had not even the slender\r\nconsolation enjoyed by sufferers in the plague[366] and small-pox, of\r\nentire immunity after having once surmounted the danger[367].\r\n\r\nThus by the end of the year the disease had spread over the whole\r\nof England, and visited every place with the same severity as the\r\nmetropolis. Many persons of rank, of the ecclesiastical and the civil\r\nclasses, became its victims; and great was the consternation when, in\r\nthe month of August, it broke out in Oxford. Professors and students\r\nfled in all directions: but death overtook many of them, and this\r\ncelebrated university was deserted for six weeks[368]. Three months\r\nlater it appeared at Croyland, and on the 14th of November, carried off\r\nLambert Fossedyke, abbot of the monastery[369]. No authentic accounts\r\nfrom other quarters have been handed down to our times, but we may\r\ninfer, from the general grief and anxiety which prevailed, that the\r\nloss of human life was very considerable.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECT. 2.—THE PHYSICIANS.\r\n\r\nThe physicians could do little or nothing for the people in this\r\nextremity[370]. They are nowhere alluded to throughout this epidemic,\r\nand even those who might have come forward to succour their fellow\r\ncitizens, had fallen into the errors of Galen, and their dialectic\r\nminds sank under this appalling phenomenon. This holds good even of\r\nthe famous Thomas Linacre, subsequently physician in ordinary to two\r\nmonarchs[371], and founder of the College of Physicians, in 1518.\r\nIn the prime of his youth he had been an eye-witness of the events\r\nat Oxford, and survived even the second and third eruption of the\r\nSweating Sickness; but in none of his writings do we find a single word\r\nrespecting this disease, which is of such permanent importance. In\r\nfact, the restorers of the medical science of ancient Greece, who were\r\nfollowed by all the most enlightened men in Europe, with the single\r\nexception of Linacre, occupied themselves rather with the ancient terms\r\nof art than with actual observation, and in their critical researches\r\noverlooked the important events that were passing before their\r\neyes[372]. This reminds us of the later Greek physicians, who for four\r\nhundred years paid no attention to the small-pox, because they could\r\nfind no description of it in the immortal works of Galen[373].\r\n\r\nNo resource was therefore left to the terrified people of England but\r\ntheir own good sense, and this led them to the adoption of a plan of\r\ntreatment, than which no physician in the world could have given them\r\na better; namely, not to resort to any violent medicines, but to apply\r\nmoderate heat, to abstain from food, taking only a small quantity of\r\nmild drink, and quietly to wait for four-and-twenty hours the crisis\r\nof this formidable malady. Those who were attacked during the day, in\r\norder to avoid any chill, immediately went to bed in their clothes,\r\nand those who sickened by night did not rise from their beds in the\r\nmorning; while all carefully avoided exposing to the air even a hand or\r\nfoot. Thus they anxiously guarded against heat or cold, so as not to\r\nexcite perspiration by the former, nor to check it by the latter—for\r\nthey well knew that either was certain death[374].\r\n\r\nThe report of the infallibility of this method soon spread over\r\nthe whole kingdom, and thus towards the commencement of 1486, many\r\nwere rescued from death. On New Year’s Day, a violent tempest arose\r\nin the south-east, and by purifying the atmosphere relieved the\r\noppression under which the people laboured, and thus, to the joy of\r\nthe whole nation, the epidemic was swept away without leaving a trace\r\nbehind[375].\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SECT. 3.—CAUSES.\r\n\r\nIt was thought remarkable, even at that time, that the Sweating\r\nSickness did not extend beyond the limits of England, and that,\r\nremaining the unenviable property of that nation, it did not even\r\nspread to Scotland, Ireland, or Calais which belonged to Britain. Much,\r\ndoubtless, was owing to the peculiarity of the climate, more still to\r\natmospherical changes, and something also to the habits of the people\r\nand the circumstances of the times. It plainly appeared in the sequel\r\nthat the English Sweating Sickness was a spirit of the mist, which\r\nhovered amid the dark clouds. Even in ordinary years, the atmosphere\r\nof England is loaded with these clouds during considerable periods,\r\nand in damp seasons they would prove the more injurious to health,\r\nas the English of those times were not accustomed to cleanliness,\r\nmoderation in their diet, or even comfortable refinements. Gluttony\r\nwas common among the nobility as well as among the lower classes; all\r\nwere immoderately addicted to drinking[376], and the manners of the age\r\nsanctioned this excess at their banquets and their festivities. If we\r\nconsider that the disease mostly attacked strong and robust men—that\r\nportion of the people who abandoned themselves without restraint to\r\nall the pleasures of the table—while women, old men, and children,\r\nalmost entirely escaped, it is obvious that a gross indulgence of the\r\nappetite must have had a considerable share in the production of this\r\nunparalleled plague.\r\n\r\nTo this may be added, the humidity of the year 1485, which is\r\nrepresented by most chronicles as very remarkable[377]. Throughout\r\nthe whole of Europe the rain fell in torrents, and inundations were\r\nfrequent. Damp weather is not prejudicial to health if it be merely\r\ntemporary, but if the rain be excessive for a series of years, so that\r\nthe ground is completely saturated, and the mists attract baneful\r\nexhalations out of the earth, man must necessarily suffer from the\r\nnoxious state of the soil and atmosphere. Under these circumstances\r\nepidemics must inevitably follow. The five preceding years had been\r\nunusually wet[378], 1485 proved equally so; the last hot and droughty\r\nsummer was that of 1479[379]. Extensive inundations of the Tiber,\r\nthe Po, the Danube, the Rhine, and most of the other great rivers,\r\ntook place in 1480, and were attended with the usual consequences,\r\nthe deterioration of the air, misery and disease[380]. The greatest\r\ninundation ever remembered in England was that of the Severn, in\r\nOctober, 1483. It was long afterwards called the Duke of Buckingham’s\r\nGreat Water[381], because it frustrated the rebellion of this powerful\r\nsubject against Richard III., whom he had been instrumental in placing\r\nupon the throne; and consequently defeated also the first enterprise\r\nof Henry VII. It lasted full ten days, and the tremendous ravages\r\noccasioned by the overwhelming torrent dwelt long in the memory of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECT. 4.—OTHER EPIDEMICS.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of this period the nations of Europe were visited\r\nwith various and destructive plagues. In 1477, the Bubo-plague\r\nbroke out in Italy, and raged without interruption till 1485[382].\r\nIt was accompanied by striking natural phenomena, among which we\r\nmay reckon an enormous flight of locusts in 1478[383] and 1482, and\r\nremarkable inter-current diseases, such as inflammatory pain in the\r\nside, throughout the whole of Italy in 1482[384]. In Switzerland and\r\nSouthern Germany malignant epidemics[385] appeared in the train of\r\ndrought and famine in 1480 and 1481, while putrid fever accompanied by\r\nphrenites[386], prevailed in Westphalia, Hesse and Friesland. There had\r\nnever been in the memory of the inhabitants of these districts so many\r\nignes fatui as during this period. There too the people suffered from\r\nthe failure of the harvest, so that it was necessary to obtain supplies\r\nfrom Thuringen[387]. France, where, under the fearful reign of Louis\r\nXI., oppression and misery seemed to mock the gifts of heaven, became\r\nin 1482, after a two years’ scarcity, the scene of a devastating\r\nplague. It was an inflammatory fever with delirium, accompanied by such\r\nintense pain in the head, that many dashed out their brains against\r\nthe wall, or rushed into the water; while others, after incessantly\r\nrunning to and fro, died in a state of the greatest agony. According\r\nto the notion of the age, this disease was attributed to astral\r\ninfluences, for it could not have been brought on only by famine,\r\nwhich left to the poor peasantry, south of the Loire, nothing but the\r\nroots of wild herbs to support their miserable existence[388], since\r\nthe higher classes were also frequently attacked[389]. This fever was\r\nwithout doubt accompanied by inflammation of the meninges, or even of\r\nthe brain itself, and was, perhaps, identical with that which at the\r\nsame period desolated the north-west of Germany as far as the shores\r\nof the North Sea, only that it was heightened by the greater natural\r\nvivacity and miserable situation of the French people, who were kept\r\nin a state of perpetual dread by the cruel executions of Louis[390].\r\nThis pestilence occasioned the king to follow the advice of his morose\r\nphysician[391] in ordinary, and to keep himself closely confined within\r\nthe town of Plessis des Tours. It was prohibited under a heavy penalty\r\nto speak in his presence of death which was carrying off its victims in\r\nall directions, and forty crossbowmen kept guard in the fosse of the\r\ncastle to put to death every living thing which might approach[392].\r\nTwo years after, in 1484, virulent diseases[393] again visited Germany\r\nand Switzerland; and thus it seemed as if the nations were everywhere\r\nthreatened with death and destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECT. 5.—RICHMOND’S ARMY.\r\n\r\nFrom these data, which might easily be extended[394], it is evident\r\nthat the Sweating Sickness of 1485 did not make its appearance without\r\ngreat and general premisory events, which for a series of years\r\nimparted to the people of England a susceptibility to dangerous and\r\nunusual diseases. If, besides this, we take into account the gloomy\r\ntemperament of the English, and the general depression of their\r\nspirits, in consequence of the sanguinary wars of the red and white\r\nroses, a series of events which seems to have shaken their faith\r\nin an overruling Providence, we may readily conceive that it would\r\nrequire but a very slight impulse to excite a powerful commotion\r\nin the mysterious mechanism of the human body. This impulse was\r\nevidently given by the landing of Richmond’s army in the very year\r\nwhen great and portentous evils were anticipated; for on the 16th of\r\nMarch, the same day when Queen Ann, the unfortunate wife of Richard\r\nIII., expired, a total eclipse of the sun enveloped all Europe in\r\ndarkness, and gave rise to gloomy prognostications[395]. Even under\r\nordinary circumstances, wars beget pestilential disorders—how much\r\nmore inevitably must these have arisen in the then existing state\r\nof affairs! Richmond’s army consisted not of brave men animated by\r\nzeal to avenge their dishonoured country or to serve a good cause.\r\nIt was composed of wandering freebooters, “vile landskneckte,” as\r\nthey were called in Germany, who assembled under his banner at\r\nHavre,—sharpshooters formed under Louis XI., who recklessly pillaged\r\nNormandy, and whom Charles VIII. gladly made over to Henry, in order to\r\nfree his own peaceful territories from so great a scourge[396]. This\r\narmy may not have been worse than others of the same period[397]; but\r\ncooped up as they were for a whole week in dirty ships, they doubtless\r\ncarried about with them all the material for germinating the seeds of a\r\npestilential disorder, which broke out soon after on the banks of the\r\nSevern and in the camp at Litchfield.\r\n\r\n\r\n               SECT. 6.—NATURE OF THE SWEATING SICKNESS.\r\n\r\n                      PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION.\r\n\r\nBefore we proceed further, some account is here required of the\r\nnature of this disease. It was an inflammatory rheumatic fever, with\r\ngreat disorder of the nervous system. This assumption is supported\r\nby the manner of its origin and its especial characteristic of being\r\naccompanied by a profuse and injurious perspiration. From the judgment\r\nthat we are now capable of forming of the pernicious influences which\r\nprevailed in the year 1485, it may, without hesitation, be admitted\r\nthat the humidity of that and of the preceding years affected the\r\nfunctions of the lungs and of the skin, and disturbed the relation\r\nof this very important tissue to the internal organs of life. This\r\nis the usual commencement of rheumatic fevers, which bear the same\r\nrelation to the Sweating Sickness as slight symptoms bear to severe\r\nones of the same kind. The predominance of affections of the brain\r\nand of the nerves, however, gave to the English epidemic a peculiar\r\ncharacter. The functions of the eighth pair of nerves were violently\r\ndisordered in this disease, as was shewn by oppressed respiration and\r\nextreme anxiety with nausea and vomiting, symptoms to which the moderns\r\nattach much importance[398]. The stupor and profound lethargy shew\r\nthat there was injury of the brain, to which, in all probability, was\r\nadded a stagnation of black blood in the torpid veins. We must also\r\ntake into the account a previous corruption and decomposition of the\r\nblood, which, even if we should be disinclined to infer their existence\r\nfrom the offensive perspiration of the disease itself, were proved\r\nby striking phenomena of a similar nature that occurred in Central\r\nEurope about the same time; for the scurvy prevailed as an epidemic,\r\nmore especially in Germany, in the year 1486, and with such severe\r\nand unusual symptoms, that people were inclined to regard it as a\r\ntotally new malady[399]. Now such is the vital connexion of different\r\nfunctions that every impediment to respiration, whether in consequence\r\nof pressure from without, or through spasm and irritation of the nerves\r\nfrom within, or even from a morbid condition of the circulating fluid,\r\ninfallibly calls forth the compensating activity of the skin, and the\r\nbody becomes suffused with an alleviating perspiration.\r\n\r\nThus it plainly appears that the profuse perspiration in the disease\r\nof which we are treating, notwithstanding its apparently injurious\r\ntendency, was the result of a commotion excited on the part of the\r\nlungs, which was critical with respect to the disease itself; and\r\nthis is in accordance with all the causes of which we still have any\r\nknowledge. Noxious and even stinking fogs penetrated into the organs\r\nof respiration, and as the blood was thus so much affected in its\r\ncomposition and in its vitality that its corrupt state was only to\r\nbe obviated by profuse perspiration, the inevitable consequence was\r\nan interference with the extensive functions of the eighth pair of\r\nnerves, which interference, as later writers relate, extended in many\r\ncases to the spinal marrow, and brought on violent convulsions[400].\r\nWe have here only one essential cause, out of many, for this gigantic\r\ndisease, and one too which accounts for its advance and spread. It\r\nis highly probable, for the reasons stated, and as according with\r\nall human experience, that it first broke out in the army of Henry\r\nthe VIIth, and beyond all doubt that it spread from west to east,\r\nand afterwards in a retrograde course from east to west. With the\r\nperfectly equable operation of the predisposing causes, from which\r\nthe disease ought indubitably to have broken out all over England\r\nat the same time, had the condition of the atmosphere been its sole\r\noccasion, we must additionally presume a special cause for its progress\r\nthrough towns and villages. This, according to all appearance, was to\r\nbe found in the air, impregnated with foul odours, which surrounded\r\nthe sick, and abounded in the tents and dwellings in which Henry the\r\nVIIth’s soldiers, after various privations and hard service, amid\r\nstorms and rain, were closely crowded together. Of both causes modern\r\nobservation furnishes analogous examples. Intermittent fevers spread\r\nmore easily in air which is contaminated by sick people, and bands\r\nof soldiers, themselves in perfect health, have not unfrequently\r\nconveyed camp fever to remote places. It signifies very little by\r\nwhat expressions of the schools these occurrences are designated; it\r\nis best perhaps to abstain from them altogether, for they are all\r\ninadequate, and occasion misconceptions. Contemporaries, however,\r\nwere certainly justified in not admitting the notion of contagion in\r\nthe same sense as when the term is applied to the plague, with which\r\nthey were well acquainted[401]. For very frequently cases which were\r\nnot to be explained on the principle of contagion communicated by\r\npersons diseased, occurred among people of rank, and manifestly arose\r\nindependently of the usual causes. In these cases the fear of death,\r\nwhich everywhere was the harbinger of the disease, and threw the nerves\r\nof the chest into spasmodic commotion, gave an impulse to the malady\r\nfor which the quality of the atmosphere and luxury had long made\r\npreparation. Had this view of contemporaries been even less impartial\r\nthan it really was, it would have found the most striking confirmation\r\nin the sudden cessation of the pestilence throughout the whole country.\r\nFor the destructive spirits of air, which would not have been discerned\r\neven by the proud naturalists of the nineteenth century, dispersed and\r\nvanished for half an age in the fury of the tempest which raged on the\r\n1st of January, 1486.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n              THE SECOND VISITATION OF THE DISEASE.—1506.\r\n\r\n    “The times were rough and full of mutations and rare\r\n     incidents.”—_Bacon_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECT. 1.—MERCENARY TROOPS.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the sixteenth century, society was very\r\ndifferently constituted from what it was at the period when Henry the\r\nVIIth unfurled his banner for victory. The darkness of the middle ages\r\nhad receded, as at the approach of a sun still hidden behind a cloud.\r\nThe mind unconsciously expanded in the unwonted light of day—the whole\r\nearth was on the eve of renovation—new energies were to be called into\r\naction—events more stupendous had never occurred, nor had more creative\r\nideas ever aroused the spirit of man. The invention of Gutenberg\r\nburst through the bonds of mental darkness, and gave to freedom of\r\nthought imperishable wings; unsuspected powers successively developed\r\nthemselves; and, while in Western Europe an ardent desire arose boldly\r\nto overstep the ancient limits of human activity, the hopes of the more\r\nenlightened fell far short of the actual result of such unexpected\r\nevents. The discovery of the New World, and the circumnavigation of\r\nAfrica, laid the foundation for great improvements; yet the events\r\nin Central Europe, though less striking to contemporaries, were in\r\ntheir consequences, infinitely more important and beneficial. The\r\nestablishment of civil order among all the nations of the West took\r\nplace at this period, which forms so important a boundary between the\r\nmiddle ages and modern times. Regal power was fixed on a firm basis,\r\nand when the castles had fallen before the artillery of the princes\r\nand imperial cities, so that the petty feudal barons were compelled to\r\nswear obedience to the laws, an end was put to the incessant predatory\r\nfeuds which had so long desolated Europe, and the establishment of\r\ninternal peace was followed by the security of life and property—the\r\nfirst essential of refinement in manners and of the free development of\r\nhuman society.\r\n\r\nThis great result of a concatenation of circumstances was not, however,\r\nbrought about without violent struggles and innovations, the effects of\r\nwhich were felt for centuries; but it was probably _the establishment\r\nof standing armies_ which had the greatest influence on European\r\ncivilization. They became indeed the pillars of civil order, but having\r\nproceeded immediately from the pernicious mercenary system, they long\r\nnourished the seeds of unrestrained depravity, and transmitted to later\r\ngenerations the corruptions of the middle ages. The Lansquenets[402]\r\n(Landsknechte) of the emperor, and the mercenaries of the kings of\r\nFrance and England, who, during the war, had joined the smaller\r\nbranches of the standing army, were homeless adventurers from every\r\ncountry in Europe, and were allured, not by military ambition, but\r\nsolely by the prospect of booty[403]. In whatever country the drum\r\nbeat to arms, they flocked together like swarms of locusts—no one knew\r\nfrom whence—and defying the feeble restraints of military discipline,\r\nindulged, during the continuance of the war, in all the unbridled\r\nlicence of a predatory life.\r\n\r\nHence the unbounded barbarity of their mode of warfare, which was\r\nrestrained only by the individual exertions of more humane commanders.\r\nThere was, however, a decided contrariety between this system and\r\nthe moral condition of the people of Western Europe: a contrariety\r\nwhich was never entirely removed by the subsequent introduction of a\r\nmore strict military discipline, and which has been done away only\r\nin modern times, by the establishment of regular armies on a system\r\nmore congenial to the feelings of the people. Hence the consequences\r\nwere the more pernicious, for when the armies were disbanded on the\r\nconclusion of peace, the Landsknechts dispersed in all directions, not\r\nto follow the plough again, or to resume their former occupations, but\r\nto pass their time in idleness and dissipation, if enriched by booty,\r\nand if reduced to poverty by intemperance and gambling, to infest the\r\ncountry as mendicants or robbers, till a new war again summoned them\r\nfrom their dishonourable mode of life[404]. Probably but very few were\r\never able to rise from such deep degradation, and many fell early\r\nvictims to their vices[405], while the infection of their example\r\nbrought fresh accessions from every town and village to the mercenary\r\nlegions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECT. 2.—NEW CIRCUMSTANCES.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that in such a condition of affairs, the effect which\r\nthe plague produced on civil society must have been different from\r\nthat of former times. Pernicious influences which, during the middle\r\nages, had endangered the health of the inhabitants of towns, and had\r\noften rendered disorders, naturally slight, in the highest degree\r\nmalignant, were for ever removed. Under this head may be mentioned\r\nmore particularly the ill-contrived construction of the houses and\r\nstreets, which even yet, in large cities, destroys the comfort of the\r\ninhabitants of whole districts, and those not of the poorest class\r\nonly. As people acquired confidence in the security of peace, it ceased\r\nto be necessary to protect every country town by fortifications.\r\nThe walls were thrown down, the stagnant moats were filled up, and\r\nas people were no longer limited to a narrow space, they built more\r\nconvenient houses in airy streets; the dark alleys and damp dwellings\r\nunder ground were gradually abandoned, and a more comfortable mode of\r\nliving superseded the former misery. By this means the mortality was\r\nconsiderably diminished, and the power of epidemics was checked; nor\r\ncan it be doubted, that the better administration of the laws greatly\r\nobviated the dissolution of social ties in times of plague, and the\r\neffects of superstition and religious animosity, which had formerly\r\nbeen so frightful. These inestimable national improvements, however,\r\ntook place but gradually, and were not a little retarded for a time by\r\nthe new evil of the employment of mercenaries. For as the germs of vice\r\nwere scattered in all directions by the wandering Lansquenets, so also\r\nthe infection of noxious diseases found easier entrance into the towns\r\nand villages through the medium of this dissolute and widely spread\r\nclass of men. The Lansquenets of the sixteenth century, as spreaders\r\nof contagion, supplied the place of the former Romish pilgrims and\r\nflagellants; they even proved a more permanent scourge than those\r\nwanderers of the middle ages, who only made their appearance on\r\nextraordinary occasions. We need here only call to mind the malignant\r\nand beyond measure noisome lues which at the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury spread with the rapidity of lightning over all Europe. It was\r\nnot an importation from the innocent inhabitants of the New World, nor\r\nwas it bred by the ill-treated Marrani[406], the victims of the Spanish\r\nInquisition. It was the mercenary army of Charles the VIIIth in Naples\r\n(1495), whose excesses gave to the already existing poison a malignity\r\ntill then unknown, and prepared for the deeply rooted depravity, a\r\nscourge at which all the world shuddered with horror. It is, moreover,\r\nin place here to observe that, in the larger armies which the new\r\nmilitary system now brought into the field, the ordinary camp diseases,\r\nto which another very fatal one was added[407], were of course much\r\nmore extensively propagated than in the less numerous forces of\r\npreceding centuries, and consequently that the peaceful inhabitants\r\nof the towns and of the country at large were thereby exposed to much\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECT. 3.—SWEATING SICKNESS.\r\n\r\nMeantime Europe was frequently and very severely visited by the\r\nepidemics of the middle ages, the terrors of the constantly recurring\r\nplague being borne with gloomy resignation to the inevitable evil\r\nwith which, as a merited chastisement, the anger of God, according\r\nto the notion of the times, afflicted the human race. Even the\r\nEnglish were not exempt from this fearful visitation, which, in the\r\nyear 1499, carried off 30,000 people in London alone, so that the\r\nking found it advisable to retire with all his court to Calais[408].\r\nThus the recollection of the Sweating Sickness of 1485 was gradually\r\nobliterated. No one thought of its possible return, and all the world\r\nwas occupied with other matters, when the old enemy unexpectedly again\r\nraised his head in the summer of 1506, and scared away this comfortable\r\nstate of false security. The renewed eruption of the epidemic was not,\r\non this occasion, connected with any important occurrence, so that\r\ncontemporaries have not even mentioned the month in which it began\r\nto rage. Towards the autumn it had again disappeared, and as no new\r\nsymptoms were added to the disease, the form of which was identified\r\nby a reference to the old descriptions, it was immediately treated by\r\nthe same means, the efficacy of which those who had witnessed the\r\nepidemic of 1485 lauded with so much reason[409]. Every exposure to\r\nheat or cold was, as at that time, avoided, and the malignant fever\r\nwas left to the curative powers of nature, the patient being kept\r\nmoderately warm in bed; and no powerful medicines being administered.\r\nThe result was beyond all expectation favourable, for in few houses did\r\nany fatal cases occur. The victory over this dreaded enemy was now, by\r\na pardonable error, attributed more to human skill than to the mildness\r\nof the malady on this occasion, which, even under a less judicious\r\ntreatment of the sick, would certainly not have been marked by any\r\nconsiderable degree of severity.\r\n\r\nThe disease broke out in London, but whether it penetrated to the\r\nwest or not, contemporary writers, being soon convinced of its slight\r\ncharacter, have left us no intelligence. However widely it may have\r\nspread, it certainly was confined to England, and nowhere occasioned\r\nany great mortality.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   SECT. 4.—ACCOMPANYING PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\nAs the epidemic was on this occasion so very mild, it was not\r\naccompanied by any remarkable phenomena in England, but the case was\r\notherwise in the rest of Europe, as will be proved by the following\r\ndetails. After a wet summer, in the year 1505, a severe winter set\r\nin[410]. Comets were seen in this as in the following year. An\r\neruption of Vesuvius also took place in 1506[411], which may be\r\nmentioned, although it is well established that volcanic commotions\r\nare to be taken into account only in great pestilences, not in less\r\nextensive epidemics. In England there blew a violent storm from the\r\nsouth-west, from the 15th till the 26th of January, 1506, which drove\r\nthe king of Castille, Philip of Austria, with his consort Johanna,\r\nfrom the Netherlands to Weymouth; and as, some days before, a golden\r\neagle falling from St. Paul’s church, in London, had crushed a black\r\neagle which ornamented some lower building, evil predictions were\r\npromulgated among the people respecting the fate of this son of the\r\nemperor[412]. This event, however, could not be considered as at all\r\nconnected with the pestilence which broke out about half a year\r\nafterwards. More consideration is due to the gloom and anxiety which\r\nat that time depressed the spirit of the English nation. The reckless\r\navarice of Henry the VIIth, named the English Solomon[413], gave just\r\nground for doubts regarding the security of property; and the pious\r\nfoundations—those accustomed means of softening the dreaded wrath of\r\nheaven, which the king, who became gradually more and more broken\r\ndown by disease, established, could not efface the recollection of\r\nthe arbitrary violence and extortions of his corrupt servants[414].\r\nAlthough these extortions principally affected the wealthy nobility,\r\nwho were much in need of restraint, yet dark mistrust was general,\r\nand all cheerfulness was banished from the minds of the people. This\r\nstate of feeling might have been favourable to the propagation of the\r\nreturning disease, but the genius of the year 1506 would not suffer it\r\nto be more than a slight and transient reminiscence of a mystically\r\nhidden danger, the import of which was not apparent to any medical\r\ninquirer of the 16th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n               SECT. 5.—PETECHIAL FEVER IN ITALY, 1505.\r\n\r\nThus, if we paid attention, as usual, only to the palpable occurrences\r\nwhich take place on the earth and beneath its surface, the Sweating\r\nSickness of the above-mentioned year might appear to be unconnected\r\nwith more considerable commotions of organic life. The powers of\r\nnature, however, are in their operations too subtle to be comprehended\r\nby our dull senses and by the coarse mechanism of our organs; nay,\r\nprecisely at a time when neither the one nor the other indicate\r\nany alteration around us, those operations bring to light the most\r\nextraordinary phenomena in the human frame—that most sensitive index\r\nof secret influences on life. This observation was fully confirmed at\r\nthe time of the first return of the sweating fever. For whilst this\r\ndisease remained confined to England, there appeared in the southern\r\nand central parts of Europe a new and fatal epidemic, which thenceforth\r\nvisited these nations almost continually with intense malignity. This\r\nwas the petechial fever, a disease unknown to the older physicians,\r\nwhich was first observed in 1490, in Granada, where it threatened to\r\nannihilate the army of Ferdinand the Catholic, and made great havoc\r\nalso among the Saracens[415]. The bubo plague had immediately preceded\r\nit, (1483, 1485, 1486, 1488, 1489, and 1490[416],) and it may with no\r\nsmall probability be assumed that the petechial fever had resulted from\r\nthis as a peculiar variety, since in other countries also, fifteen\r\nyears later, the bubo plague degenerated in various ways, and examples\r\nare not wanting in which particular forms or constituent parts of great\r\nepidemics thus branch off from them, in the same manner as, under\r\nfavourable circumstances, these will combine together, and united into\r\none destructive whole, multiply the sources of danger.\r\n\r\nYet some contemporaries were of opinion that the petechial fever had\r\nbeen brought over to Granada[417] by Venetian mercenaries from Cyprus,\r\nwhere they had fought against the Turks, and where this disorder was\r\nsaid to have been indigenous. Notwithstanding some good works[418]\r\nalready existing, this matter has need of a more thorough examination,\r\nwhich might bring to light important and instructive results,\r\nrespecting the rise and spread of the petechial fever, and especially\r\nrespecting its relation to other plagues. Whatever may be held with\r\nregard to the true origin of this fever, thus much is established,\r\nthat it was at first an independent European disease, and that, at the\r\ncommencement, having occupied the southern part of this quarter of the\r\nworld, it then became connected, in a manner as extraordinary as it was\r\nworthy of observation, with the sweating sickness of the north; since\r\nthe nearly simultaneous eruption of the sweating fever in England, with\r\nthe great epidemic petechial fever in the year 1505, may be justly\r\nattributed to an influence common to both, although unquestionably of\r\ngreater power in the latter.\r\n\r\nThe epidemic petechial fever, of which we are now treating, prevailed\r\nprincipally in Italy, and is described by Fracastoro as the first\r\nplague of this kind which ever appeared in that country. Of this new\r\ndisease[419], which was placed by this great physician midway between\r\nthe bubo plague and the non-pestilential fever, the contagious quality\r\nshowed itself from the beginning; yet it was plainly perceived, that\r\nthe contagion did not take effect so quickly as in the bubo plague,\r\nthat it was not conveyed so easily by means of clothing and other\r\narticles, and that physicians and attendants on the sick were the\r\nonly persons who incurred much danger of infection. The fever began\r\ninsidiously, and with very slight symptoms, so that the sick in\r\ngeneral did not so much as seek medical aid. Many persons, and even\r\nphysicians among the number, suffered themselves to be deceived by this\r\ncircumstance, and thus, not being aware of the danger, they hoped to\r\neffect an easy cure, and were not a little astonished at the sudden\r\ndevelopment of malignant phenomena. The heat was inconsiderable, in\r\nproportion to the fever, yet those affected felt a certain inward\r\nindisposition, a general depression of all the vital powers, and a\r\nweariness as if after great exertion. They lay upon their backs with an\r\noppressed brain, their senses were blunted, and in most cases delirium\r\nand gloomy muttering, with bloodshot eyes, commenced from the fourth\r\nto the seventh day. The urine was usually clear and copious at the\r\nbeginning, it then became red and turbid, or resembling pomegranate\r\nwine, (granatwein,) the pulse was slow and small, the evacuations\r\nputrid and offensive, and either on the fourth or seventh day red\r\nor purple spots, like flea-bites, or larger, or resembling lentils,\r\n(lenticulæ,) which also gave a name to the disorder, broke out on the\r\narms, the back, and the breast. There was either no thirst at all, or\r\nvery little; the tongue was loaded, and in many cases a lethargic state\r\ncame on. Others, on the contrary, suffered from sleeplessness, or from\r\nboth these symptoms alternately. The disease reached its height on\r\nthe seventh or on the fourteenth day, and in some cases still later.\r\nIn many there existed a retention of urine with very unfavourable\r\nprognosis. Women seldom died of this fever, elderly people still more\r\nrarely, and Jews scarcely ever. Young people, on the other hand, and\r\nchildren died in great numbers, and especially from among the higher\r\nranks, while the plague, on the contrary, used generally to commit its\r\nravages only among the poorer classes. An inordinate loss of power in\r\nthe commencement betokened death, as also a too violent effect from\r\nmild aperient means, and a failure in alleviation after a complete\r\ncrisis. Patients were seen to die who had lost to the extent of three\r\npounds of blood from the nose. It was also a very bad sign when the\r\nspots disappeared, or broke out tardily, or were of a blackish-blue\r\ncolour. Phenomena of an opposite character, on the contrary, afforded\r\nhope of recovery.\r\n\r\nThe best physicians were agreed on the importance of the petechiæ as an\r\nindication of the nature of the crisis; for those cases in which they\r\nwere abundant and of a good quality were cured much more easily than\r\nthose in which the eruption was suppressed. An abundant perspiration\r\nalso was particularly conducive to recovery, whereas all other\r\nevacuations, especially a flux from the bowels, proved to be injurious\r\nand even fatal.\r\n\r\nIf we keep these phenomena in view, and consider, moreover, that in\r\nthe widely extending lues venerea of those times cutaneous eruptions\r\npredominated over the other symptoms, the English sweating sickness\r\nin the north of Europe will appear, as in connexion with this\r\ncircumstance, of a very important character; and the supposition,\r\nthat the morbid activity of the system during the whole of this age,\r\nmaintained a decided determination to the skin, may thence be fairly\r\nconsidered as something more than a mere conjecture.\r\n\r\nThis fact speaks for itself, but the causes of this altered temperament\r\nof the body it is not an easy matter to discover. Fracastoro, who knew\r\nmuch better than his modern followers how to manage his sagacious\r\ndoctrine of contagion, looked for these causes in the quality of the\r\nair, which was manifest by much more evident phenomena in the epidemic\r\npetechial fever of 1528 than in that of 1505, and he traced an active\r\nconnexion between this quality, which he called “infection of the\r\natmosphere,”[420] and the condition of the blood; thus indicating\r\nunknown influences by an obscure notion. He considered the altered\r\nquality of the blood according to the established views of that period,\r\nwhich the petechial spotted fever seemed clearly to confirm, as a\r\nputrefaction; and he even assumed that, in the non-epidemic petechial\r\nfevers, which, from the year 1505 forward, frequently occurred,\r\nisolated causes must have given rise to changes in the blood, as well\r\nas that quality of the air, to which this great physician attributed\r\nthe general and continued alterations which take place in the nature of\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nThe petechial fever made the same impression on the physicians of Italy\r\nas new disorders have ever made; for although they were the best in\r\nEurope, their view was bounded by the horizon of Galen, within the\r\nlimits of which the novel phenomenon was not to be found. They were\r\ntherefore soon perplexed, and whilst they sought to entrammel the\r\ndreaded enemy with scholastic doctrines of repletion and acrimony and\r\noccult qualities, and betook themselves first to one remedy and then\r\nto another, they exposed themselves to the derision of the people,\r\nwho soon perceived their disagreement and indecision, and, as usual,\r\ncharged on the whole medical profession the well merited blame of\r\nindividuals[421].\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECT. 6.—OTHER DISEASES.\r\n\r\nAbout the same period, in October, 1505, a very fatal disease broke out\r\nin Lisbon, the further progress of which was marked by the terror, the\r\nflight, and the confusion of the inhabitants[422]. Of what kind it was,\r\nwhether a petechial fever or a bubo plague, and what connexion it had\r\nwith a pestilence in Spain which had just preceded it, it would perhaps\r\nbe difficult now to ascertain. This latter pestilence had spread from\r\nSeville, following an earthquake, and violent storms of wind and rain\r\nin 1504, and may very likely have been a bubo plague. Similar notices\r\nare met with of pestilences occurring in that country in 1506, the\r\nyear of the English Sweating Sickness, in 1507 and 1508, in which\r\nyears mention is made of swarms of locusts in the neighbourhood of\r\nSeville, and finally in 1510, the year of a great influenza[423], and\r\n1515. Exact descriptions, however, of these disorders are entirely\r\nwanting[424].\r\n\r\nWith all the above phenomena, the epidemics which took place in\r\nGermany and France at the commencement of the sixteenth century,\r\nevidently unite to form a connected whole. Varying in intensity and\r\nextent, they continued without intermission for full five years, and\r\nmoreover were accompanied by unusual circumstances, such as occur only\r\nin the time of great pestilences. The century was ushered in by the\r\nappearance of a comet[425], which, on this occasion, seemed to confirm\r\nthe long cherished belief that the appearance of these heavenly bodies\r\nwas prognostic of evil. For mankind are in the habit of concluding that\r\nphenomena which are simultaneous must have some internal connexion, and\r\nmany examples were called to mind in which great pestilences affecting\r\nthe whole world had been either preceded or accompanied by comets[426].\r\nImmediately afterwards a great murrain among cattle took place,\r\nwhich may have proceeded from some injurious quality in their food.\r\nA notion immediately arose that the pastures were poisoned, and of\r\nthis there was so firm a conviction, that the most violent resentment,\r\nas of old, in the time of the Black Death, prevailed against the\r\nsupposed poisoners, and in the neighbourhood of Meissen some “böse\r\nBuben” (wicked knaves) who had fallen under suspicion, were actually\r\nexecuted[427].\r\n\r\nA very considerable blight of caterpillars which, in the north\r\nof Germany, stripped the gardens and woods far and wide of their\r\nfoliage, deserves to be here mentioned as a phenomenon appertaining\r\nto the lower grades of the animal kingdom[428]. Natural history has\r\nshewn that occurrences of this kind are by no means occasioned by\r\nnew and wonderful influences, but rather by unusual combinations of\r\ncircumstances, appearing to occur together almost accidentally, at a\r\ngiven time; especially by the simultaneous union of warmth and humidity\r\nin the atmosphere, whereby sometimes one and sometimes another of the\r\nlower grades of animal existences becomes extraordinarily developed. It\r\nis on this account that unusual phenomena in the insect world, whether\r\nit be the appearance or the disappearance of particular kinds, take\r\nplace much more frequently when the order of succession in the seasons\r\nand the condition of the atmosphere are in a greater degree than\r\nusual and more permanently disturbed; and thus those phenomena have,\r\nwith much reason, ever been considered as forerunners of pestilences,\r\nwhenever the human frame has become, through atmospherical causes,\r\ngenerally susceptible of disease. Swarms of locusts have appeared\r\nbefore and during most great pestilences, and indeed the exuberant\r\nproduction of this insect appears, at least in Europe, to require the\r\nmost unusual combination of causes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECT. 7.—BLOOD SPOTS.\r\n\r\nOf rarer occurrence, but quite as important in reference to the\r\ngeneral tendencies of life, are _the luxuriant growths of the minutest\r\ncryptogamic plants in the water, and on damp things of all kinds_,\r\nwhich, from their spots of various forms and colours, produced the\r\nutmost horror both before and during great pestilences, and excited\r\nsuperstitious fears, as appearing to be something miraculous. These\r\nspots (signacula), and especially the _blood-spots_, were seen at a\r\nvery early period, as for instance during the great general plague\r\nin the sixth century[429], and again, during the plague of the years\r\n786[430] and 959, when it is said to have been remarked, that those\r\non whose clothes they frequently appeared, and seemingly imparted to\r\nthem a peculiar odour, were more susceptible than other people of\r\nattack from leprosy, on which account this spotted appearance was\r\ninconsiderately called the clothes leprosy[431], (Lepra vestium;) not\r\nto mention other examples[432] in which plagues affecting the human\r\nspecies did not take place. The same signs also, in the years from\r\n1500 to 1503, threw the faithful into great consternation, because,\r\nas on former occasions, they fancied they recognised in them the form\r\nof the cross[433]. The phenomenon on this occasion spread throughout\r\nGermany and France, and from its great extent and long duration, may\r\nbe reckoned among the most remarkable of the kind. The spots were of\r\ndifferent colours, principally red, but also white, yellow, grey,\r\nand black, and arose, often in a very short time on the roofs of\r\nhouses, on clothes, on the veils and neck handkerchiefs of women, on\r\nvarious household utensils, on the meat in larders, &c. A historian,\r\nwho speaks also of blood-rain[434], recounts that they could not be\r\ngot rid of in less than ten or twelve days, and that they frequently\r\noccurred in closed chests, on linen and on articles of clothing[435].\r\nMuch information is not to be expected from the researches of the\r\nnaturalists of those times, but there is no doubt that what is\r\ndescribed was some one or more kinds of mould[436], inasmuch as the\r\nwhole phenomenon evidently corresponds with modern observations[437].\r\nScientific physicians of the sixteenth century, among whom the\r\nnaturalist George Agricola, who was born in 1494, and died in 1555,\r\nought especially to be mentioned, recognised, even then, these spots\r\nas lichens, and without seeking to account for them by supernatural\r\nagencies, or lending credence to popular superstition, they gave them\r\ntheir just interpretation as indications of extensive disease[438].\r\nShould the too bold notion of Nees v. Esenbeck, that fungi of the most\r\nminute forms have their origin in the higher regions of the firmament,\r\nand descending to the surface of the earth, produce spots and stains,\r\nbe confirmed, which is not yet the case, these “signacula” would have\r\na much more important connexion with epidemics than can be otherwise\r\nconceded to them; for though it be highly probable that they have\r\ntheir origin only in the dissemination of germs in the lower strata\r\nof the atmosphere, it must yet be granted, that if they appear over\r\na considerable space, and during a long time, as at the commencement\r\nof the sixteenth century, the causes favouring their generation and\r\nspread, must be ranked among those of an extraordinary kind, and on\r\nthis very account may exercise an influence over human organism, as was\r\nthen evident.\r\n\r\nFor so early as the fruitful year 1503, the plague, which had already\r\nappeared partially, made great advances, and France in particular\r\nwas visited by so fatal a pestilence, that the inhabitants of towns\r\nand villages, in order to escape the infection, fled in bodies\r\nto the woods, and even the house-dogs became wild, which never\r\nhappens, unless a country be extensively depopulated[439]. They were\r\nobliged to establish great hunts, in order to free the country from\r\nthese new beasts of prey, and from wolves which appeared in great\r\nmultitudes[440]. The dry and continued heat of the following year,\r\n1504, having given rise to still more extensive sickness, and caused\r\na failure in the crops, the bubo plague raged in Germany with such\r\nviolence, that in some places a third part, and in others as many as\r\nhalf the inhabitants perished. Various kinds of fevers accompanied\r\nthis overwhelming disease, among which there was one distinguished\r\nby headache and phrensy similar to that which appeared in France, in\r\n1482[441]. Various putrid fevers and putrid inflammations of the lungs\r\nwith bloody expectoration, are also no less plainly discernible from\r\nthe accounts[442]. This diversified and general sickness throughout\r\nthe whole of Germany, terminated in the cold winter of 1504–5 and the\r\nfollowing summer, during which there was a continued murrain among\r\ncattle. It is certain, that at that time the petechial fever in Italy,\r\nhad not yet passed the Alps.\r\n\r\n_From all these facts it is a probable conjecture, that the Sweating\r\nSickness which visited England in the year 1506, although accompanied\r\nin that country itself by no prominent circumstances, was not without\r\nconnexion with the morbid commotion of human and animal life in the\r\nsouth and middle of Europe, and may perhaps be regarded as having\r\nbeen the last feeble effort of mysterious agencies in the domain of\r\norganized being._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n               THE THIRD VISITATION OF THE DISEASE.—1517\r\n\r\n    “This learned Lord, this Lord of wit and art,\r\n     This metaphysick Lord, holds forth a Glasse,\r\n     Through which we may behold in every part\r\n     This boisterous prince.”—HOWELL[443].\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SECT. 1.—POVERTY.\r\n\r\nThe ordinances of Henry the VIIth, which, although adapted to the\r\ntimes, bore hard upon the people, soon produced their fruits. The great\r\ndiminished the number of their servants, and as, moreover, many of the\r\npeasantry were thrown out of employment in consequence of a conversion\r\nof large tracts of arable land into pasture[444], the population of\r\ntowns increased even to an overflow, and the consequent activity of\r\ntrade gradually rendered the towns flourishing. But this change took\r\nplace too rapidly. Wealth and luxury engendered, it is true, numerous\r\nwants which were a source of gain, so that the English were at this\r\ntime considered luxurious and effeminate[445], but there was a general\r\nscarcity of workmen and artists, and hence it happened, that from\r\nGenoa, Lombardy, France, Germany and Holland, innumerable foreigners\r\nimmigrated and took possession of the most lucrative branches of\r\nemployment. This was a peculiar hardship on the natives, who from\r\ntheir imperfect knowledge of the arts, could not compete with the more\r\nskilful foreigners, and were besides treated by them with insolence and\r\ncontempt. The distresses of the poor thus increased yearly, and their\r\nindignation at length broke out. A great insurrection of the English\r\nartisans arose throughout London, and might have proved destructive to\r\nthe foreigners, had affairs been in a less orderly state. The popular\r\ncommotion was, however, suppressed without any considerable sacrifice,\r\nand Henry the VIIIth on a solemn day, appointed at Westminster, for\r\npassing judgment upon the prisoners, bestowed a pardon on them; for he\r\nsaw into the causes of their discontent, and very soon after caused\r\nrestrictive alien laws to be enacted[446].\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECT. 2.—SWEATING SICKNESS.\r\n\r\nAll this took place in April and May of the ever memorable year 1517,\r\nand London was again indulging in hopes of better days, when the\r\nSweating Sickness once more broke out quite unexpectedly in July, and\r\nin spite of all former experience, and the most sedulous attention,\r\ninexorably demanded its victims. On this occasion it was so violent and\r\nso rapid in its course, that it carried off those who were attacked in\r\ntwo or three hours, so that the first shivering fit was regarded as the\r\nannouncement of certain death. It was not ushered in by any precursory\r\nsymptoms. Many who were in good health at noon, were numbered among\r\nthe dead by the evening, and thus as great a dread was created at\r\nthis new peril as ever was felt during the prevalence of the most\r\nsuddenly destructive epidemic: for the thought of being snatched away\r\nfrom the full enjoyment of existence without any preparation, without\r\nany hope of recovery, is appalling even to the bravest, and excites\r\nsecret trepidation and anguish. Among the lower classes the deaths\r\nwere innumerable[447]. The city was moreover crowded with poor; but\r\neven the ranks of the higher classes were thinned, and no precaution\r\naverted death from their palaces. Ammonius of Lucca, a scholar of\r\nsome celebrity, and in this capacity private secretary to the king,\r\nwas cut off in the flower of his age, after having boasted to Sir\r\nThomas More, only a few hours before his death, that by moderation\r\nand good management he had secured both himself and his family from\r\nthe disease[448]. Also of those immediately about the king, Lords\r\nGrey and Clinton were carried off, besides many knights, officers and\r\ncourtiers. Mourning supplanted the hilarity and brilliancy of the\r\nfestivals, and the king, while in miserable solitude, into which he\r\nhad retired with a few followers, received message after message from\r\ndifferent towns and villages, announcing, that in some a third, in\r\nothers even half the inhabitants were swept off by this pestilence.\r\nIt had never before raged with so much fatality. The minds of men had\r\nnever before been so frightfully appalled. The festival of Michaelmas,\r\n(29th September,) which in England was always kept with much religious\r\npomp, was of necessity postponed; nor was the solemnity of Christmas\r\nobserved, for there was a dread of collecting together large assemblies\r\nof people[449], on account of the contagion; and just about this time,\r\nwhen the Sweating Sickness had abated, the plague, according to the\r\naccount of some historians, began, which, although probably not very\r\nvirulent, prevailed during the whole winter in most English towns,\r\nand continued to keep up the distress of the people. The king on this\r\noccasion also quitted his capital, and retreated, in company with a few\r\nattendants, before the contagion, frequently shifting his court from\r\nplace to place. It was during this period of trouble (11th of February,\r\n1518) that the Princess Mary, afterwards Queen, was born[450].\r\n\r\nThus the Sweating Sickness lasted full six months, reached its\r\ngreatest height[451] about six weeks after its appearance, and\r\nprobably spread from London over the whole of England. In Oxford and\r\nCambridge it raged with no less violence than in the capital. Most of\r\nthe inhabitants of those places were, in the course of a few days,\r\nconfined to their beds, and the sciences, which then flourished, for\r\nthey were never more zealously cultivated in England than at that time,\r\nsuffered severe losses by the death of many able and distinguished\r\nscholars[452]. Scotland, Ireland and all other countries beyond sea,\r\nwere on this occasion spared. The neighbouring town of Calais alone was\r\nreached[453] by the pestilence; and according to later observations,\r\nit may be considered as certain, that only the English who resided\r\nthere, and not the French inhabitants, were affected, as it is also\r\nascertained that the rest of France continued throughout free from\r\nthe disease. Had this not been the case, contemporary writers would\r\nundoubtedly not have omitted to make mention of so important an\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SECT. 3.—CAUSES.\r\n\r\nThe influences which gave rise to this third eruption of the disorder\r\namong the English nation are obscure, and do not altogether correspond\r\nwith those of the years 1485 and 1506. Thus it is especially\r\nremarkable, that, on this occasion, there is no express mention of\r\nthe humidity which had so decided a share in the origin of the two\r\nformer visitations of the Sweating Sickness, and the year 1517 was in\r\nmost respects one of an ordinary kind. The English Chronicles state\r\nnothing remarkable on the subject, and from those of Germany we only\r\nlearn that the winter of 1516 was very mild, and that a fruitful summer\r\nwith an abundant vintage[454] and a cold winter followed. The summer\r\nof 1517 was unfruitful, although not on account of wet weather, so\r\nthat in some parts, especially in Swabia, provision was made against\r\na scarcity[455]. A great comet appeared in 1516[456], and in 1517 an\r\nearthquake was felt at Tübingen, Nördlingen, and Calw, during a violent\r\nstorm, whereupon the “Haupt Krankheit”[457] (encephalitis), accompanied\r\nby fever, became more prevalent, although not remarkably fatal[458].\r\nThis phenomenon (the earthquake) was by no means unimportant[459] in\r\nits effects, and there is reason to suppose that it was followed by\r\nsubterraneous commotions of still greater extent, for earthquakes\r\noccurred also in Spain[460]. As the date of this event is specified as\r\nthe 16th of June, and as earthquakes occurring in unusual localities,\r\nthat is to say, in districts not volcanic, are frequently cited as\r\nprognostics of great diseases, although in volcanic districts they\r\nevidently betoken nothing of the kind, we may hence with some reason\r\nassume a telluric influence, which perhaps reached the locality of the\r\npestilence that broke out at the beginning of July, if not earlier.\r\nBesides, we cannot find any greater phenomenon, which, according to\r\nhuman conception, could have had a more immediate connexion with the\r\nEnglish Sweating Sickness; and in this instance too, inquiry the most\r\ncircumspect does not penetrate through the thick veil which envelopes\r\nthe inscrutable causes of epidemics.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SECT. 4.—HABITS OF THE ENGLISH.\r\n\r\nThat next to the peculiar constitution which England imparts to her\r\ninhabitants, the predisposing causes of the Sweating Sickness lay in\r\nthe habits of the English of those times, no one can possibly doubt.\r\nThe limitation of the pestilence to England plainly indicates this.\r\nNot a single ship conveyed it to the French, or to the Dutch, who\r\nbreathed a much moister atmosphere; and yet the intercourse between the\r\nEnglish seaports and these immediately neighbouring nations was very\r\nfrequent. Of intemperance, which most generally lays the foundation\r\nfor disorders, both high and low were at this time accused. This vice\r\nof the English was proverbial in foreign countries[461]. Flesh meats\r\nhighly seasoned with spices were indulged in to excess; noisy nocturnal\r\ncarousings were become customary, and it was also the practice to\r\ndrink strong wine[462] immediately after rising in the morning. Cyder,\r\nwhich in some parts, as for instance in Devonshire, is the common\r\nbeverage[463], was, even in those times, considered by medical men\r\nas injurious, for it was observed that its use caused debility with\r\npaleness, and sapped the vigour of youth in both sexes[464]. Other\r\nsimilar facts respecting the mode of living at that time might perhaps\r\nbe adduced, from which it would appear that, owing to the total want\r\nof refinement in diet, much that was improper was employed in English\r\ncookery, and that on this account the constitution was much injured.\r\nHorticulture, which the French had already brought to a state of\r\ngreat improvement[465], was still quite in its infancy in England.\r\nIt is even said that Queen Catherine had pot-herbs brought from\r\nHolland for the preparation of salads, as they were not procurable in\r\nEngland[466]. Allowing that this account may not be strictly true,\r\nsince it admits of other explanations, still it proves in itself what\r\nwe would here enforce, and leaves us to draw conclusions from it beyond\r\nthe mere fact of there being a scarcity of culinary vegetables. Much\r\nmore important, however, as respects our subject, was the custom of\r\nwearing immoderately warm clothing, of which we have accounts worthy\r\nof credence. From youth upwards the head was covered with thick\r\ncaps, in order to secure it from every chance of cold, and from the\r\nleast draught of air; and as, by this injurious practice, the brain\r\nwas subjected to a continual determination of blood, and a tenderness\r\nof the skin was induced, there was no disorder more frequent among\r\nthe English in this century than catarrh[467], which was constantly\r\nreproduced by relaxing perspirations and heating medicines. If this\r\nmalady be complicated with a scorbutic habit, or if it befall persons\r\nof debauched habits, whose vessels contain nourishment not properly\r\nconcocted, the preservative vital power seeks a vent through the\r\nrelaxed skin, and that which in itself is a needful and alleviating\r\nexcitement of this tissue becomes a disease; the wholesome excretion\r\ndegenerates into a colliquative drain, which forcibly carries off\r\nwith it unusual animal matters that ought not to pass away through\r\nsuch an outlet, and the body yields to an attack to which it has been\r\nthus long predisposed. When we consider this debilitated state of the\r\nskin as the general complaint in England, taking into account the\r\nprejudicial influence of hot baths[468], which were much in use, and\r\nthe diaphoretic medicines employed in most disorders; when we bear in\r\nmind the rare use of soap at that time, and the high price of linen, as\r\nalso the extreme indigence of the lower classes, which almost always\r\nbreeds pestilences, the utterly miserable condition and truly Scythian\r\nfilth of the English habitations[469], and finally, the crowded state\r\nof London in the year 1517, we shall, as far as human research can\r\npenetrate, find the origin of the Sweating Sickness in this very year\r\nexplicable from causes which have long been known to be capable of\r\nproducing such effects. Something remains in the background, of which\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECT. 5.—CONTAGION.\r\n\r\nThe rapid spread of the Sweating Sickness all over England as far as\r\nthe Scottish borders, and across to Calais, now demands a more especial\r\nconsideration. Most fevers which are produced by general causes, as\r\nwell transient (epidemic) as constant and peculiar to the country\r\n(endemic), or a union of both, which almost always takes place, and was\r\nhere evidently the case, propagate themselves for a time spontaneously.\r\nThe exhalations of the affected become the germs of a similar\r\ndecomposition in those bodies which receive them, and produce in these\r\na like attack upon the internal organs; and thus a merely morbid\r\nphenomenon of life shews that it possesses the fundamental property\r\nof all life, that of propagating itself in an appropriate soil. On\r\nthis point there is no doubt,—the phenomena which prove it have been\r\nobserved from time immemorial, in an endless variety of circumstances,\r\nbut always with a uniform manifestation of the fundamental law. All\r\nnations too, and from the most ancient times, have invented ingenious\r\ndesignations for these occurrences, which, however, seldom represent\r\nthe general notion, but commonly only the peculiar propagation of\r\nindividual diseases. Certainly one of the best and the most ingenious\r\nis that which is conveyed by the German word “Ansteckung,” “setting\r\non fire,” which compares the exciting a disease in the appropriate\r\nbody, with the inflammation of combustible matter by the application\r\nof fire, or with the kindling of powder by a spark. But how various\r\nare these “Ansteckungen!”, from the purely mental, on the one hand,\r\nwhich, through the mere sight of a disagreeable nervous malady—through\r\nan excitement of the senses that shakes the mind, penetrates into the\r\nnerves, those channels of its will and of its feelings, and produces\r\nthe same disorder in the beholder, to those, on the other hand, which\r\npropagate diseases that principally operate only upon matter, and are\r\ndistinguishable but little, if at all, from animal poisons. The reader\r\nmust not here expect all the features of a doctrine which extends\r\nthrough the whole immeasurable domain of life. They are clearly\r\nderived from the confirmed and well applied experience of _the past_,\r\nand have been delineated by men[470] who had not forgotten, like their\r\nmodern successors, to take a comprehensive view of epidemic diseases.\r\nIt may, however, be permitted me just to call to mind the difference\r\nbetween those infectious diseases which are _permanent_ and for\r\ncenturies together _unchangeable_, and those which are _temporary_ and\r\n_transient_. The infecting matter of the former may aptly be called\r\nthe perfect or unchangeable in contradistinction to the imperfect or\r\nmutable character of the latter. The former, when once formed, whether\r\nin diseased persons or inanimate substances (fomites), are always\r\nin existence, and are but called into activity by those causes of\r\ngeneral disease (epidemic constitutions) which are favourable to their\r\npropagation; and it is to be remarked that under all circumstances, and\r\nat all times, they excite the same unchangeable diseases, and, varying\r\nonly in particular ramifications or degenerations and mild forms, never\r\nlose their proper essence. Examples are furnished in the small-pox, the\r\nplague, the measles, and, if we may include diseases not febrile, the\r\nleprosy, the itch, and the venereal disease. The latter, on the other\r\nhand, are not always in existence, they are called forth from nonentity\r\nby the causes of general diseases or epidemic constitutions, and they\r\ndisappear again after the extinction of the epidemic diseases by which\r\nthey were bred; they likewise vary in their development and their\r\ncourse in each particular epidemic. Examples are found in the yellow\r\nfever, in catarrh or influenza, in nervous and putrid fever, and, among\r\nmany other disorders, in miliary fever, a disease which first grew\r\nto a national pestilence in the 17th century, and which, in the kind\r\nand manner of its infecting power, approaches nearest to the sweating\r\nfever. To this latter category the English Sweating Sickness likewise\r\nbelongs; a disease altogether of a temporary character, which, after\r\nits cessation, left no infecting material behind, and consequently was\r\nincapable of propagating itself after the manner of those diseases\r\nwhich are completely contagious. The animal matters, which were\r\nexpelled along with the profuse perspiration, and spread so horrible a\r\nstench around the sick, contained amid their alkaline salts, (probably\r\nammonia in various states of combination,) and their superabundant\r\nacid, the ferment of the disease; and this penetrated into the\r\nlungs of the bystanders as they breathed, and provided they were but\r\npredisposed for its reception, as above stated, continually produced\r\nit. It may be considered as certain that mere manual contact was not\r\nsufficient to communicate the infection, and that this was propagated,\r\neither by the pestilential atmosphere which surrounded the beds of the\r\nsick, or by exhalations generated in unclean situations where there was\r\nno vent for their escape. On this account it was that the residence at\r\ncommon inns and public-houses was looked upon as dangerous[471].\r\n\r\nI would not, however, be understood to maintain that, during the\r\nthree epidemics with which, up to the present stage of our inquiry,\r\nwe have become acquainted, the spread of the sweating fever alone\r\nwas occasioned by infection; for if the general epidemic causes\r\nwere powerful enough to excite the disease, without any previously\r\nexisting poison, why might they not produce the same effect still more\r\nindependently throughout the course of the pestilence, since, as is\r\nthe case in all epidemics, those causes in all probability continued\r\nto increase in intensity? That the plague grew worse on the occasion\r\nof any great assemblages of the people, was at that time known, and\r\nthe notion of contagion thence very naturally arose. Yet, must it\r\nhere be taken into account, that even without this notion, and merely\r\nfrom the assemblage itself of many people in whom the like malady\r\nwas germinating, and already had shewn tokens of its approach, that\r\napproach might easily be accelerated, and the disease increased among\r\nthose merely slightly indisposed, by the reciprocal communication of\r\nmorbid exhalations. For as the predisposition to any malady, which\r\nis an intermediate condition between that malady and the previous\r\nstate of good health[472], plainly displays the properties of the\r\ndisease in those whom it _threatens_ to attack, so these exhalations\r\n(or epidemic causes which give rise to Sweating Sickness in the first\r\ninstance) certainly differ from those which occur in a sweating\r\nsickness which has already broken out, only in unessential respects,\r\nand might consequently stimulate the mere disposition to the disease\r\nmore and more, even to the actual eruption of the disease itself.\r\nYet a contagion was likewise in operation at the same time which was\r\ndestructive even to the temperate, and to those who were apparently\r\nin health, nay, even to foreigners, who were living in an English\r\natmosphere and on English food, as the example of the Italian Ammonius\r\nplainly proves[473].\r\n\r\nIn all epidemics which increase to such a degree as to become\r\ncontagious, it is of importance to distinguish which of these causes\r\nare the more powerful, the predisposing or epidemic causes, which\r\noriginate the proneness to the disease, or the proximate causes, among\r\nwhich, in the generality of cases, contagion is the most prominent. The\r\npredisposing were here evidently the more operative; contagion was not\r\nadded till the disease was at its height, and although it contributed\r\nnot a little to its spread, yet it always remained subordinate to\r\nthe other sources of the disease, and all the matter of infection\r\nvanished without a trace, on the cessation of the disorder, so that the\r\nsubsequent eruptions of it were always produced by the renewal of those\r\ngeneral causes which are in operation upon and under the earth. It is,\r\nhowever, as little within the compass of human knowledge to discover\r\nthe essential foundation of this renewal, as the proximate causes of\r\nthe appearance of the mould spots at the commencement of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, or any other of those processes which are prepared and brought\r\ninto activity by the hidden powers of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECT. 6.—INFLUENZAS.\r\n\r\nSeveral epidemics thus originating in causes beyond human comprehension\r\nappeared in the 16th century. Among the most remarkable was a violent\r\nand extensive catarrhal fever in 1510, of that kind which the Italians\r\ncall Influenza, thus recognising an inscrutable influence which affects\r\nnumberless persons at the same time. It prevailed principally in\r\nFrance, but probably also over the rest of Europe, of which, however,\r\nthe accounts do not inform us, for in those times they took little\r\npains to record the particulars of epidemics which were not of a\r\ncharacter to affect life. According to recent experience we should be\r\nwarranted even in supposing that this malady had its origin in the\r\nremotest parts of the East. During the whole of the winter, which was\r\nvery cold, violent storms of wind prevailed, and the north and middle\r\nof Italy were shaken by frequent earthquakes; whereupon there followed\r\nso general a sickness in France, that we are assured by the historians\r\nthat few of the inhabitants escaped it. The catarrhal symptoms,\r\nwhich on the appearance of disorders of this kind usually form their\r\ncommencement, seem to have been quite thrown into the background by\r\nthose of violent rheumatism and inflammation. The patient was first\r\nseized with giddiness and severe headache; then came on a shooting\r\npain through the shoulders, and extending to the thighs. The loins\r\ntoo were affected with intolerably painful dartings, during which\r\nan inflammatory fever set in with delirium and violent excitement.\r\nIn some the parotid glands became inflamed, and even the digestive\r\norgans participated in the deep-rooted malady; for those affected had,\r\ntogether with constant oppression at the stomach, a great loathing for\r\nall animal food, and a dislike even to wine. Among the poor as well as\r\nthe rich many died, and some quite suddenly, of this strange disease,\r\nin the treatment of which the physicians shortened life not a little by\r\ntheir purgative treatment and phlebotomy, seeking an excuse for their\r\nignorance in the influence of the constellations, and alleging that\r\nastral diseases were beyond the reach of human art[474].\r\n\r\nFrom this prejudicial effect of our chief antiphlogistic remedy,\r\nbleeding, as well as of evacuations from the bowels, we may conclude\r\nthat the disease, though in its commencement rheumatic, yet had an\r\nessential tendency to produce relaxation and debility of the nerves,\r\nand in this respect, as well as in its extension to all classes,\r\naccorded with the modern influenzas, in which the same phenomena have\r\nmanifested themselves only much less vividly and plainly. The French,\r\nwho, from the levity of their character, have always called serious\r\nthings by jocose names, designate this disease “Coqueluche” (the monk’s\r\nhood), because, owing to the extreme sensibility of the skin to cold\r\nand currents of air, this kind of hood was generally necessary, and\r\nwas a protection against an attack of the malady, as well as against\r\nits increase. That in the accounts, which are, to be sure, very\r\nincomplete, there should be no express mention of any affection of the\r\nair-passages, is remarkable, since this could not in all likelihood\r\nhave failed to exist; although it might perhaps have been only slightly\r\nmanifested. Nearly a century before (1414), this affection appeared\r\nfar more prominently on the occurrence of a no less general disorder\r\nof the same kind; so that all those who had the complaint, suffered\r\nfrom a considerable hoarseness, and all public business in Paris\r\nwas interrupted on this account[475]. It was on that very occasion\r\nthat the name Coqueluche was first employed, and this having, as is\r\nwell known, been transferred to the whooping-cough, it is easier to\r\nsuppose, with respect to the influenza of 1510, which was similarly\r\nnamed, an omission in the account, than the real absence of a symptom\r\nso very generally prevalent; for in these kinds of comparisons and\r\ndenominations, the common sense of the people errs much less than the\r\nlearned profundity of political historians.\r\n\r\nWe must not omit here to remark that three years before (1411), and\r\nthirteen years afterwards, two diseases entirely similar and equally\r\ngeneral, made their appearance in France, of which we nowhere find that\r\nany notice has been taken up to the present time. The first was called\r\n_Tac_, the second _Ladendo_, which designations have since entirely\r\ngone out of use. Both were accompanied by very severe cough, so that\r\nin the former, ruptures not unfrequently occurred, and pregnant women\r\nwere in consequence prematurely confined, and by the latter, from\r\nits universality, the public worship was disturbed. In the ladendo,\r\nthere seems to have been an affection of the kidney of an inflammatory\r\ncharacter, and much more severe than in the coqueluche of 1510, a\r\nmemorable example of epidemic influence, and without a parallel in\r\nmodern times. This pain in the kidneys, which was as severe as a\r\nfit of the stone, was followed by fever with loss of appetite, and\r\nan incessant cough that terminated in disagreeable eruptions about\r\nthe mouth and nose. The disorder ran a course of about fifteen days,\r\nand was generally prevalent throughout October, being unattended\r\nwith danger, notwithstanding the severity of its symptoms. One might\r\nalmost be tempted to regard the tac of 1411 as the coqueluche of 1414,\r\nwhich is only slightly alluded to by Mezeray, and whereof the author\r\nfrom whom we are now quoting, has made no mention; for a false date\r\nmight easily occur here. Yet this must remain undecided until we can\r\nobtain fuller information, for we have experienced, even in the most\r\nrecent times, an example of influenzas (1831 and 1833) following each\r\nother in quick succession. Gastric symptoms and an inordinate degree\r\nof irritability accompanied the spasmodic cough, and the complaint\r\nterminated with evacuations of blood. However, the disease was\r\nunattended with danger, and lasted upon the whole only three weeks[476].\r\n\r\nFour other epidemics similar to that of 1510 appeared in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, two which were quite general in the years 1557 and 1580, and\r\ntwo less extensively prevalent in the years 1551 and 1564[477]. Of\r\nthe two former we possess accurate descriptions; it will therefore\r\naid us in forming a correct judgment respecting the influenza\r\nof 1510, if we here take a review of these also, since the most\r\nexperienced contemporaries classed all these disorders together as of\r\na similar kind. During the dry unfavourable summer of 1557, invalids\r\nwere suddenly seized with hoarseness and oppression at the chest,\r\naccompanied with a pressure on the head, and followed by shivering and\r\nsuch a violent cough, that they thought they should be suffocated,\r\nespecially during the night. This cough was dry at first, but about the\r\nseventh day, or even later, an abundant secretion took place either\r\nof thick mucus or of thin frothy fluid. Upon this the cough somewhat\r\nabated, and the breathing became freer. During the whole course of\r\nthe disorder, however, patients complained of insufferable languor,\r\nloss of strength, want of appetite and even nausea at the sight of\r\nfood, restlessness and want of sleep. The malady ended in most cases\r\nin abundant perspiration, but occasionally in diarrhœa. Rich and\r\npoor, people of every occupation and of all ages, were seized with\r\nthis disease in whole crowds simultaneously, and it passed easily\r\nfrom a single case to a whole household. On this occasion death\r\nrarely occurred, except in children who had not power to endure the\r\nseverity of the cough, and medicine was of little avail, either in\r\nalleviating the disorder or arresting its destructive course. The\r\nalready established name of this disease was immediately called to\r\nmind again in France. It was not, however, confined to that kingdom,\r\nbut prevailed as generally, with some considerable varieties of form,\r\nin Italy, Germany, Holland, and doubtless over a still wider range of\r\ncountry[478]. The same was the case with the influenza of 1580, which\r\nspread over the whole of Europe, and seems to have been less severe;\r\nthus bearing a closer resemblance[479] to that of 1831 and 1833,\r\nwhich is still in the recollection of most of our readers from their\r\nown experience. A more elaborate research into this very important\r\nsubject would far surpass the limits of this treatise, for phenomena\r\ndeeply affecting the whole system of human collective life are here\r\nto be considered, which can only become apparent when received as a\r\nconnected whole, yet we must at least point out the relation which the\r\ninfluenzas bear to the greater epidemics. This is quite apparent; for\r\nas catarrhs are not unfrequently the forerunners, accompaniments or\r\nsequelæ of important diseases in individual cases[480], excitement of\r\nthe mucous membrane being often merely an outward sign of more deeply\r\nseated commotion, so also are influenzas usually only the _first\r\nmanifestations, but sometimes also the last remains of extensive\r\nepidemics_. The most recent example is still fresh in our memories. The\r\ninfluenza of 1831 was immediately followed by the Indian cholera, and\r\nscarcely had this, after its revival in Eastern and central Europe,\r\nvanished, when the influenza of 1833 appeared, as if to announce a\r\ngeneral peace. After the influenza of 1510, a plague followed in\r\nthe north of Europe, which in Denmark carried off the son of King\r\nJohn[481]; 1551 was the year of the fifth epidemic sweating sickness.\r\nIn 1557, the influenza in Holland, was followed by a bubo plague, which\r\nlasted the following year, and carried off 5000 of the inhabitants at\r\nDelft[482]. In 1564, a very destructive plague raged in Spain, of which\r\n10,000 people died at Barcelona, and finally, in 1580, the last year\r\nof influenza in that century, a plague of which 40,000 died in Paris,\r\nappeared over the greater part of Europe and in Egypt[483].\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECT. 7.—EPIDEMICS OF 1517.\r\n\r\nWe now revert to the year 1517, and shall consider the epidemics\r\nwhich accompanied the English sweating sickness. First of all, the\r\n_Hauptkrankheit_, that brain fever which so often recurred in the\r\ncentral parts of Europe, appeared extensively throughout Germany. Many\r\ndied of this dangerous disease, and we are assured by contemporaries\r\nthat other inter-current inflammatory fevers were also very fatal[484].\r\nSuch was the case in Germany, the heart of Europe. Another disease,\r\nhowever, much more important, and till that time wholly unknown to\r\nmedical men, appeared in Holland, which broke out in January, 1517,\r\nand from its dangerous and quite inexplicable symptoms, spread fear\r\nand horror around. It was a malignant, and, according to the assurance\r\nof a very respectable medical eye-witness, an infectious inflammation\r\nof the throat, so rapid in its course that, unless assistance were\r\nprocured within the first eight hours, the patient was past all hope\r\nof recovery before the close of the day. Sudden pains in the throat,\r\nand violent oppression of the chest, especially in the region of the\r\nheart, threatened suffocation, and at length actually produced it.\r\nDuring the paroxysms the muscles of the throat and chest were seized\r\nwith violent spasm, and there were but short intervals of alleviation\r\nbefore a repetition of such seizures terminated in death. Unattended\r\nby any premonitory symptoms, the disease began with a severe catarrhal\r\naffection of the chest, which speedily advanced to inflammation of the\r\nair passages, and where death did not occur on the day of the attack,\r\nran on to a dangerous inflammation of the lungs, which followed the\r\nusual course, but was accompanied by a very high fever. Occasionally\r\na less perilous transition into intermittent fever was observed, but\r\nin no case did a sudden recovery take place; for even when the fever\r\nsubsided, the patient continued to suffer, for at least a month, from\r\npain in the stomach and great debility, which symptoms admit of easy\r\nexplanation to a medical man of the present day, from the fissures and\r\nsmall ulcers of the tongue, which appeared when the fever was at its\r\nheight, and obstinately resisted the usual treatment.\r\n\r\nThe remedies employed shew the circumspection and ability of the Dutch\r\nphysicians. They had recourse, as soon as possible, at the latest\r\nwithin six hours, to venesection, and followed this up immediately\r\nby purgatives, of which, however, some eminent men disapproved,\r\nand this to the great detriment of their patients, for without the\r\ncombined effect of both these means, the sudden suffocation could not\r\nbe averted. Moreover, the employment of detergent gargles, whereby\r\nthe extension of the affection to the lungs was prevented, as also\r\nof demulcent pectoral remedies, was decidedly beneficial, and it is\r\naffirmed that all who were thus treated were easily restored[485].\r\n\r\nExtraordinary and peculiar as this disease, for which contemporaries\r\nfound no name, was, its rapid onset and its sudden disappearance were\r\nstill more so. Most of those affected were taken ill at the same time,\r\nand eleven days of suffering and misery had scarcely elapsed when not\r\nanother case occurred; the numbers who had fallen victims were buried;\r\nand but for the journal of the worthy Tyengius[486], no distinct\r\nrecord would have existed of this remarkable epidemic, which however,\r\nit is certain, spread further than merely over the misty territory of\r\nHolland, and apparently with still greater malignity; for in the same\r\nyear we find it in Basle, where, within the space of eight months, it\r\ndestroyed about 2000 people, and its symptoms would seem to have been\r\nstill more strongly marked. Respecting the intermediate countries,\r\nwhich it is highly probable that the disease passed through from\r\nHolland before it reached Basle, we unfortunately have no information.\r\nThe tongue and gullet were white as if covered with mould, the patient\r\nhad an aversion to food and drink, and suffered from malignant fever,\r\naccompanied with continued headache and delirium. Here also, in\r\naddition to an internal method of cure which has not been particularly\r\ndetailed, the cleansing of the mouth was perceived to be an essential\r\npart of the treatment: the viscous white coating was removed every two\r\nhours, and the tongue and fauces were afterwards smeared with honey of\r\nroses[487], whereby patients were restored more easily than when this\r\nprecaution was omitted[488].\r\n\r\nIt appears, according to modern experience, to admit of no doubt that\r\nthis disease consisted of an inflammation of the mucous membrane which,\r\naccompanied by a secretion of lymph, spread from the œsophagus to the\r\nstomach, and likewise through the air passages to the lungs, being\r\nthus identical with pharyngeal croup, which was represented a few\r\nyears ago as a new disease, and has in consequence been designated by\r\na special name[489]. Its subsequent appearance in the memorable year\r\n1557, respecting which we have a still more complete account, gives\r\nadditional weight to this supposition. In that year it broke out in\r\nOctober, and was observed by Forest, who was himself the subject of\r\nit, at Alkmaar, where it attacked whole families, and in the course of\r\na few weeks destroyed more than 200 people. It was not, however, so\r\nexcessively rapid in its course as in 1517, but began with a slight\r\nfever like a common catarrh, and shewed its great malignity only by\r\ndegrees. Sudden fits of suffocation then came on, and the pain of the\r\nchest was so dreadfully distressing that the sufferers imagined they\r\nmust die in the paroxysm. The complaint was increased still more by\r\na tight convulsive cough, and until this was relieved by a secretion\r\nof mucus, proved dangerous, especially to pregnant women, sixteen of\r\nwhom died within the space of eight days, whilst those who survived\r\nwere all prematurely brought to bed. The fever which accompanied the\r\ninflammation was very various in its course. It was rarely observed\r\nto continue without intermission, but where this was the case, was\r\nattended with the greatest peril. Yet death did not take place on this\r\nvisitation until the ninth or fourteenth day, whereas in the year 1517\r\nas many hours would have sufficed to produce a fatal termination.\r\nAfter this period the danger diminished, and those patients were most\r\nsecure from suffocation, provided they had good medical attendance,\r\nwhose complaint had been accompanied throughout its course by fever\r\nof only an intermittent character. So marked was the influence of the\r\nDutch soil, that until this intermittent passed into continued fever\r\nof different gradations, it appeared of the purest and most unmixed\r\ntype. In these cases the inflammation was less completely formed, so\r\nthat even bleeding, a remedy otherwise indispensable, was sometimes\r\nunnecessary. Those affected all suffered most at night and in the\r\nmorning, the latter generally bringing with it the inflammation of\r\nthe larynx and trachea, which, however, they had not at that time\r\nexperience enough to recognise as such, perceiving as they did only\r\na slight redness in the fauces. The painful affection of the stomach\r\nwas also in this epidemic very distinctly marked, so that a sense of\r\npressure at the præcordia, accompanied by continual acid eructations,\r\ncontinued to exist even after a succession of six or seven fits of\r\nfever; and convalescents were troubled for a long time with dyspepsia,\r\ndebility and hypochondriasis. The inflammation of the mucous membrane,\r\nno doubt, affected the nervous plexuses of the abdomen, as is usually\r\nthe case, and totally changed the secretion. This was proved by the\r\ntreatment, for, by administering the necessary purgative remedies, a\r\nvast quantity of offensive mucus, mixed with bile, was evacuated.\r\n\r\nOur excellent eye-witness assures us that the people sickened as\r\nsuddenly as if they had inhaled a poisonous blast, so that more than a\r\nthousand people in Alkmaar betook themselves to their beds in a single\r\nday, a thick stinking mist having previously for several days spread\r\nover the land. This pestilence did not terminate so speedily as that of\r\nthe year 1517; on the contrary, it delayed until the winter, and seems\r\nto have formed the conclusion of a whole series of morbid phenomena,\r\nparticularly of the already mentioned influenza throughout Europe, and\r\nof the bubo plague in Holland, which had occurred in the middle of\r\nthe summer,—phenomena that were accompanied by the usual attendants\r\nof epidemics, namely great scarcity, and unusual occurrences in the\r\natmosphere, such, for instance, as electric illuminations of prominent\r\nobjects, and so forth[490].\r\n\r\nThe close connexion between this inflammation of the air-passages\r\nand gullet and the epidemic catarrh is quite apparent; for these\r\nare but gradations and gradual transitions in the affection of the\r\nmucous membrane, as also in the power of atmospherical causes, which\r\nespecially influence the organs of respiration. We believe, therefore,\r\nthat we are fully justified in classing the epidemic described to have\r\ntaken place in Holland and Germany in 1517, with the influenzas; and\r\nin declaring the morbid commotion in human collective life which thus\r\nmanifested itself, to have been a forerunner of the English pestilence,\r\nwhich was simultaneously prepared by the altered condition of the\r\natmosphere, and broke out a few months later.\r\n\r\nWe ought not to omit here to mention that, in this same year, 1517, the\r\nsmall-pox, and with it, as field-poppies among corn, the measles, was\r\nconveyed by Europeans to Hispaniola, and committed dreadful ravages at\r\nthat time, as afterwards, among the unfortunate inhabitants. Whether\r\nthe eruption of these infectious diseases in the new world was favoured\r\nby an epidemic influence or not, can no longer be ascertained; yet the\r\naffirmative seems probable from the fact, that the small-pox did not\r\ncommit its greatest ravages in Hispaniola[491] until the following\r\nyear, and, according to recent experience, those epidemic influences\r\nwhich extend from Europe westward, always require some time to reach\r\nthe eastern coasts of America.\r\n\r\nBut even without this phenomenon in the New World, which is now for the\r\nfirst time placed within the pale of observations on epidemics, we have\r\nfacts at hand sufficiently numerous and worthy of credit to prove—_that\r\nthe English Sweating Sickness of 1517, made its appearance, not alone,\r\nbut surrounded by a whole group of epidemics, and that these were\r\ncalled forth by general morbific influences of an unknown nature_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n           THE FOURTH VISITATION OF THE DISEASE.—1528, 1529.\r\n\r\n    “Und wenn die Welt voll Teufel wär’,\r\n     Und wollten uns verschlingen;\r\n     So fürchten wir uns nicht so sehr,\r\n     Es soll uns doch gelingen!”—LUTHER.\r\n\r\n\r\n     SECT. 1.—DESTRUCTION OF THE FRENCH ARMY BEFORE NAPLES, 1528.\r\n\r\nThe events to which we are now about to allude, demonstrate, by their\r\nsurprising course, that the fate of nations is at times far more\r\ndependent on the laws of physical life than on the will of potentates\r\nor the collective efforts of human action, and that these prove utterly\r\nimpotent when opposed to the unfettered powers of nature. These powers,\r\ninscrutable in their dominion, destructive in their effects, stay the\r\ncourse of events, baffle the grandest plans, paralyse the boldest\r\nflights of the mind, and when victory seemed within their grasp, have\r\noften annihilated embattled hosts with the flaming sword of the angel\r\nof death.\r\n\r\nTo obliterate the disgrace of Pavia[492], Francis I. in league with\r\nEngland, Switzerland, Rome, Genoa and Venice against the too powerful\r\nEmperor of Germany, sent a fine army into Italy. The emperor’s troops\r\ngave way wherever the French plumes appeared, and victory seemed\r\nfaithful only to the banners of France and to the military experience\r\nof a tried leader[493]. Every thing promised a glorious issue; Naples\r\nalone, weakly defended by German lansquenets and Spaniards[494],\r\nremained still to be vanquished. The siege was opened on the 1st of\r\nMay, 1528, and the general confidently pledged his honour for the\r\nconquest of this strong city, which had once been so destructive to the\r\nFrench[495]. It was easy with an army of 30,000 veteran warriors[496]\r\nto overpower the imperialists; and a small body of English[497] seemed\r\nto have come merely to partake in the festivals after the expected\r\nvictory. The city too suffered from a scarcity, for it was blockaded\r\nby Doria, with his Genoese galleys; and water, fit to drink, failed\r\nafter Lautrec had turned off the aqueducts of Poggio reale; so that the\r\nplague, which had never entirely ceased among the Germans since the\r\nsacking of Rome[498], began to spread.\r\n\r\nBut amidst this confidence in the success of the French arms, the means\r\nfor ensuring it were gradually neglected. The valour of the intrepid\r\nand prudent commander was doubtless equal to the minor vicissitudes\r\nof war, but whilst the length of the delay paralysed his activity,\r\nnature herself suddenly proved fatal to this hitherto victorious army:\r\npestilences began to rage among the troops, and human courage could\r\nno longer withstand the “far-shooting arrows of the god of day.” The\r\nconsequence was, that within the space of seven weeks, out of the whole\r\nhost which up to that period had been eager for combat, a mere handful\r\nremained, consisting of a few thousands of cadaverous figures, who were\r\nalmost incapable of bearing arms or of following the commands of their\r\nsick leaders. On the 29th of August the siege was raised, fifteen\r\ndays after the heroic Lautrec, bowed down by chagrin and disease, had\r\nresigned his breath; the wreck of the army retreated amid thunder and\r\nheavy rain[499], and were soon captured by the imperialists, so that\r\nbut few of them ever saw their native land again.\r\n\r\nThis siege brought still greater misery upon France than even the fatal\r\nbattle of Pavia, for about 5000 of the French nobility, some from the\r\nmost distinguished families, had perished under the walls of Naples;\r\nits remoter consequences too were humiliating to the king, and the\r\npeople; since owing to its failure all those hitherto feasible schemes\r\nwere blighted, which had for their object the establishment of French\r\ndominion beyond the Alps. It behoves us, therefore, to pay so much the\r\nmore attention to those essential causes of this event, which fall\r\nwithin the province of medical research.\r\n\r\nThe mortality which occurred in the camp, began probably as early as\r\nJune, after the usual calamities which surround an army in an enemy’s\r\ncountry. The French and Swiss were insatiable in their indulgence in\r\nfruit, which the gardens and fields furnished them in abundance, whilst\r\nthere was a scarcity of bread and of other proper food[500]. Hence\r\nfevers soon broke out, which increased in malignity the longer they\r\nexisted, accompanied no doubt by debilitating diarrhœas, which never\r\nfail to make their appearance under circumstances of this kind, and are\r\nin themselves among the most pernicious of camp diseases, since they\r\nnot only destroy in the individual case by the exhaustion which they\r\noccasion, but likewise by infecting the air, prepare the way for the\r\nworst pestilences.\r\n\r\nThese diseases were, however, little noticed, and there was\r\nconsequently no attempt made to diminish their causes. It became daily\r\nmore and more apparent, that the cutting off of the sources near Poggio\r\nreale, which Lautrec had commanded, in order to compel the besieged\r\nto a more speedy surrender, was in the highest degree injurious to\r\nthe besiegers themselves; for the water, having now no outlet, spread\r\nover the plain where the camp was situated, which it converted into a\r\nswamp, whence it rose, morning and evening, in the form of thick fogs.\r\nFrom this cause, and while a southerly wind continued to prevail, the\r\nsickness soon became general. Those soldiers, who were not already\r\nconfined to bed in their tents, were seen with pallid visages, swelled\r\nlegs, and bloated bellies, scarcely able to crawl; so that, weary\r\nof nightly watching, they were often plundered by the marauding\r\nNeapolitans. The great mortality did not commence until about the 15th\r\nof July, but so dreadful was its ravages, that about three weeks were\r\nsufficient to complete the almost entire destruction of the army[501].\r\nAround and within the tents vacated by the death of their inmates,\r\nnoxious weeds sprang up. Thousands perished without help, either in\r\na state of stupor, or in the raving delirium of fever[502]. In the\r\nentrenchments, in the tents, and wherever death had overtaken his\r\nvictims, there unburied corpses lay, and the dead that were interred,\r\nswollen with putridity, burst their shallow graves, and spread a\r\npoisonous stench far and wide over the camp. There was no longer any\r\nthought of order or military discipline, and many of the commanders and\r\ncaptains were either sick themselves, or had fled to the neighbouring\r\ntowns, in order to avoid the contagion[503].\r\n\r\nThe glory of the French arms was departed, and her proud banners\r\ncowered beneath an unhallowed spectre. Meanwhile the pestilence broke\r\nout among the Venetian galleys under Pietro Lando. Doria had already\r\ngone over to the Emperor[504], and thus was this expedition, begun\r\nunder the most favourable auspices, frustrated on every side by the\r\nmalignant influence of the season.\r\n\r\nNo medical contemporary has described the nature of this violent\r\ndisease, and historians have on this point preserved only general\r\noutlines, which do not afford sufficient materials to ground an\r\ninvestigation. Certain it is, that in the year 1528, a very malignant\r\n_petechial fever_ extended throughout Italy, and in the proper\r\nsense of the word prevailed so decidedly, that it even followed the\r\nItalians abroad in the same way as the Sweating Sickness did the\r\nEnglish, as is proved by the case of the learned Venetian Naugerio,\r\nwho, being dispatched on an embassy to Francis the 1st, died at\r\nBlois on the Loire, of this very disease, with which the French\r\nhad yet no acquaintance[505]. Contemporaries assure us, that this\r\nepidemic committed great ravages in the country, already distracted\r\nby wars and feuds, and it is therefore hardly to be doubted, that,\r\noccurring as it did in those same years, it was the disease of\r\nwhich we have been treating, the malignity of which was increased\r\non extraordinary occasions. A pestilence which, just before the\r\nsiege of Naples, destroyed one-third of the inhabitants of Cremona,\r\nwas in all probability the petechial fever[506]. Yet, here and\r\nthere, the old bubo plague made its appearance. This it was which\r\nin the year 1524 carried off 50,000 people in Milan[507], and this\r\nappears likewise to have been the disease which, after the sacking\r\nof Rome, broke out among the German lansquenets, and in a short time\r\nannihilated two-thirds of these troops. Contemporaries saw therein\r\nGod’s just punishment of their desecration of the Holy See, for in the\r\nsucceeding years, all the remaining participators in the storming of\r\nthe eternal city, also met with an end worthy of their crimes[508].\r\nThey did not take into account, however, the beastly intemperance\r\nand excesses of the soldiery, whose eagerness after plunder led them\r\nto encounter the plague poison in the most secret holes and corners;\r\nnor did they reflect, that the plague penetrated the Castle of St.\r\nAngelo itself, and destroyed some of the courtiers almost under the\r\neyes of the Pope[509]. Of these lansquenets, many went to Naples in\r\nthe following year under the Prince of Orange, and it may with good\r\nground be supposed, that they took with them to that city fresh germs\r\nof plague; to which may be added, the by no means incredible story,\r\nthat the besieged sent infected and sick soldiers to the French, in\r\norder to cause poisonous pestilences to break out among them[510].\r\nThis very circumstance tells in favour of bubo plague, for the decided\r\ncertainty of its contagious nature was known, and seemed beyond all\r\ncomparison greater than the more conditional communicability of the\r\nnew disease[511]. Moreover, the same attempt at impestation had been\r\nalready often made in earlier times.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, also to be considered, on the other side, that the\r\nFrench army was more exposed to the epidemic influence of the air, the\r\nwater, and the general powers of nature, than any other assemblage\r\nof men, and, that this influence was probably more powerful in the\r\nyear 1529, than at any other time during the sixteenth century. The\r\nformation of fog in the heat of summer is at all times an extraordinary\r\nphenomenon[512], which decidedly indicates a disproportion in the\r\nmutual action of the components and powers of the lower strata of the\r\natmosphere. This was not dependent merely on the local peculiarities\r\nof Naples, for during the summer of 1528, grey fogs were observed\r\nthroughout Italy, which rendered the unwholesome quality of the air\r\nvisible to the eye[513]. This was increased by the prevalence of\r\nsoutherly winds, which are always, in Italy, prejudicial to health,\r\nas also by the thousand privations of a camp, so that a disease which\r\nwas already prevalent all over Italy,—we allude to the _petechial\r\nfever_,—might well break out on the damp soil of Poggio reale. In the\r\nhistory of national diseases, we find a moral proof of the predominance\r\nof epidemic influence which plainly and intelligibly manifests itself\r\nunder the greatest variety of circumstances. This is a belief, that the\r\nwater, and even the air is poisoned[514]. Nor is this proof wanting\r\nin the deplorable history of the French army before Naples, for it\r\nwas generally believed, that some Spaniards of Moorish descent, to\r\nwhom was attributed an especial degree of skill in the management of\r\npoison, and some Jews from Germany, who, for the sake of gain, had\r\nfollowed the lansquenets to truckle for their booty, had stolen out\r\nof the city under cover of the night, in order to poison the water\r\nin the neighbourhood of the camp[515]. It was also surmised, that\r\nan Italian apothecary had administered to the French knights poison\r\nin their medicine[516]. We will not anticipate on this occasion the\r\nresearches of naturalists, whose experiments on air and water, during\r\nimportant epidemics, have not yet led to any results; it is, however,\r\nnot improbable that pond and spring water, under such circumstances as\r\nare here described to have occurred, might become impregnated with a\r\nnoxious quality not inherent in it, which would very naturally give\r\nrise to the belief that a poison had been thrown into it. On the whole,\r\nthis accusation may certainly be judged according to the same views\r\nwhich have been stated in our treatise on the Black Death.\r\n\r\nFrom all these circumstances, the notion is highly probable that it\r\nwas the petechial fever which raged in the French camp; and if we may\r\nattach any importance to the incidental accounts of historians, it may\r\nperhaps be to the purpose to state that Prudencio de Sandoval, who has\r\nwritten from authentic materials, calls the disease “las bubas.”[517]\r\nThis name, it is true, presupposes a rather strange confusion of\r\npetechial fever with lues; and, indeed, the diseases among the French\r\ntroops from 1495 to 1528, have been oddly jumbled together by Sandoval.\r\nIt shews, however, that there still existed a recollection of the\r\nprevalent eruptions which occurred in the pestilence of 1528; and,\r\ntherefore, this whole account might perhaps be the more justly applied\r\nto petechial fever, as this same historian states, that the French\r\ncalled the disease after the village of Poggio reale “les Poches,”[518]\r\nby which name the well known bubo plague would hardly have been\r\ndesignated. If, however, we choose to suppose that at one and the same\r\ntime _different diseases_ prevailed in the French army, this notion is\r\nnot only supported by the express testimony of a contemporary[519], but\r\nalso by many observations ancient and modern[520], that have been made\r\nin cases where the circumstances have been similar to those which then\r\nprevailed. It is ever to be regretted that there was no intelligent\r\nMachaon to be found in the camp before Naples; such a one would\r\nundoubtedly have left us some pithy observations on the combination and\r\naffinity of petechial fever and bubo plague.\r\n\r\n\r\n   SECT. 2.—TROUSSE-GALANT IN FRANCE.—1528, AND THE FOLLOWING YEARS.\r\n\r\nDeeply as the irreparable loss of such an army was felt by the French,\r\nyet were they destined to suffer still greater misfortunes at home.\r\nThe dark power which threatened all Europe regarded neither distance\r\nnor limits. It seized on the French nation in their own country whilst\r\ntheir military youth were destroyed before Naples. The cold spring\r\nand wet summer of 1528 destroyed the growing corn[521], and a famine\r\nwas thus produced throughout France, even more grievous, on account\r\nof its duration, than the period of scarcity in the time of Louis the\r\nXIth[522], for the failure of the harvest continued for five years\r\nin succession, during which all order of the seasons seemed to have\r\nceased. A damp summer heat prevailed in autumn and winter, a frost of\r\na single day only occasionally intervening. The summer, on the other\r\nhand, was cloudy, damp, and ungenial. The length of the days alone\r\ndistinguished one month from another. It appears plainly from detached\r\naccounts how much the usual course of vegetation was disturbed.\r\nScarcely had the fruit trees shed their leaves in the autumn when they\r\nbegan to bud again, and to bear fruitless blossoms. No returns rewarded\r\nthe toil of the husbandman, and the longed-for harvest again and again\r\ndeceived the hopes of the people. Thus, even during the first of these\r\ncalamitous years, the distress became general, and the increasing\r\nindigence was no longer to be checked by human aid. Bands of beggars\r\nwandered over the country in lamentable procession. The bonds of civil\r\norder became more and more relaxed, and people soon had to fear not\r\nonly robbery and plunder on the part of these unfortunate beings, but\r\nthe contagion of a pestilence, the offspring of their distress, which\r\nfollowed in their train.\r\n\r\nThis disease was a new production of the French soil, and when it\r\nspread generally throughout the country, was the more sensibly felt,\r\nas it especially carried off young and robust men; on which account it\r\nwas designated by the very significant name of Trousse-Galant[523].\r\nIt consisted of a highly inflammatory fever, which destroyed its\r\nvictims in a very short time, even within the space of a few hours;\r\nor, if they escaped with their lives, deprived them of their hair\r\nand nails, and from a long-continued disinclination for all animal\r\nfood, left behind it, as sequelæ, a protracted debility and diseases\r\nwhich endangered the recovery of the sick, whose constitutions were\r\nalready so much shaken. Hence it appears that this fever was combined\r\nwith a great decomposition of the fluids, and a very morbid condition\r\nof the functions of the bowels, not to mention the effects produced\r\nby continued hunger, which contemporaries paint in the most dreadful\r\ncolours.\r\n\r\nThe stock of provisions was already so far consumed in the first year\r\nthat people made bread of acorns, and sought with avidity all kinds of\r\nharmless roots, merely to appease hunger. These miserable sufferers\r\nwandered about, houseless and more like corpses than living beings, and\r\nfinally, failing even to excite commiseration, perished on dunghills\r\nor in out-houses. The larger towns shut their gates against them, and\r\nthe various charitable institutions proved, of necessity, insufficient\r\nto afford relief in this frightful extremity! It was the lot of very\r\nfew to obtain the tender care and attendance of the Sisters of Charity.\r\nIn most of those affected their livid swollen countenances, and the\r\ndropsical swelling of their limbs, betrayed the sickly condition in\r\nwhich they dragged on their languishing existence. Every one fled from\r\nthese pestiferous spectres, for they were saturated with the poison of\r\nthis deadly disease, and the remark was no doubt made a thousand times\r\nover, that this poison might be conveyed to persons in health without\r\naffecting the carrier, since want and ill health occasionally afford a\r\nmiserable protection against disease of this kind[524].\r\n\r\nThe necessary data for furnishing a complete account of the\r\nTrousse-galant of 1528 do not exist, for physicians passed over this\r\nepidemic with the same coolness and indifference which unfortunately\r\nthey may be justly accused of having shewn with respect to other\r\nimportant phenomena. But it returned once again in 1545–46, appearing\r\nin Savoy and over a great part of France; and we possess from\r\nParé[525], and from Sander, a Flemish physician[526], though still a\r\ndefective, yet a more satisfactory description of its symptoms on this\r\noccasion. Its course was, as before, very rapid, so that it destroyed\r\nthe patient in two or three days; again it attacked the strong rather\r\nthan the weak, as if in justification of its old name, and those who\r\nrecovered remained for a long time distinguishable by the loss of their\r\nhair and their wretched appearance. Patients felt at the commencement\r\nan insufferable weight in the body, with extremely violent headache,\r\nwhich soon deprived them of all consciousness and passed into a\r\nprofound stupor, even the sphincter muscles losing their power. In\r\nother cases a continued state of sleeplessness was followed by feverish\r\ndelirium, so violent that it was necessary to have recourse to means\r\nof restraint. Such opposite states are usual in all typhous fevers.\r\n_Sander_ expressly mentions that in most of those affected, eruptions\r\nmade their appearance. He does not, however, state their nature or\r\ndescribe the course and crisis of the disease otherwise than that it\r\nterminated about the fourth or the eleventh day. Even the eruptions\r\nthat did appear, which were probably petechiæ, and perhaps also (rother\r\nfriesel) red miliary vesicles, came at an indefinite period; either\r\nat the commencement, when they afforded an unfavourable prognosis,\r\nor later, when they betokened a favourable crisis. Thread-worms, in\r\ngreat numbers, were evacuated alive under great torment, and generally\r\nincreased the sufferings of the patient. The disease was scarcely less\r\ncontagious than plague, and with respect to its treatment, bleeding,\r\ncopious and even ad deliquium, was decidedly successful, which coupled\r\nwith the attacks on the head just described[527], leads to the\r\nconclusion that there existed a fulness of blood and an inflammatory\r\nstate of circulation, together, perhaps, with inflammation of the\r\nbrain. We must not omit to observe that, during the pestilence of 1546,\r\nthe bubo plague made its appearance here and there, especially in the\r\nNetherlands[528]; and in the following year, broke out and spread to a\r\ngreater extent in France[529], whence it seems to follow, with respect\r\nto the malady of which we are now treating, that its nature resembled\r\nthe petechial fever, since that disease usually precedes the occurrence\r\nof pestilences[530].\r\n\r\nThe assertion of historians, that in 1528, and the following years,\r\nFrance lost a fourth part of her inhabitants by famine and pestilence,\r\nseems, according to our representation, not to be by any means\r\nexaggerated. The consequences, as regarded the future destinies of that\r\ncountry, were likewise very important. For Francis the 1st saw that no\r\nnew sacrifices could be borne by his people, who were already so sorely\r\nafflicted; and therefore abandoned his schemes of greatness and foreign\r\npower, consenting, on the 5th of August, 1529, to the disadvantageous\r\ntreaty of Cambray.\r\n\r\n\r\n             SECT. 3.—SWEATING SICKNESS IN ENGLAND, 1528.\r\n\r\nWhoever, following the above facts, will represent to himself the\r\nstate of Europe in 1528, will readily believe, that a poisonous\r\natmosphere enveloped this quarter of the globe, and continually brought\r\ndestruction and death over its nations. Ruin broke in upon them in a\r\nthousand forms, destroying their bodies and benighting their minds, and\r\nif to this we add the discord and the deadly party hatred which at that\r\ntime prevailed in the world, it seems as if every circumstance that\r\ncould affect mankind was implicated in this gigantic conflict, which\r\nthreatened in its fatal result to annihilate all traces of the times\r\nthat were past.\r\n\r\nA heavier affliction than has yet been described was in store for\r\nEngland: for in the latter end of May, the Sweating Fever broke out\r\nthere in the midst of the most populous part of the capital, spreading\r\nrapidly over the whole kingdom; and fourteen months later, brought\r\na scene of horror upon all the nations of northern Europe, scarcely\r\nequalled during any other epidemic. It appeared at once with the same\r\nintensity as it had shewn eleven years before, was ushered in by no\r\nprevious indications, and between health and death there lay but a\r\nbrief term of five or six hours. Public business was postponed: the\r\ncourts were closed, and four weeks after the pestilence broke out,\r\nthe festival of St. John[531] was stopped, to the great sorrow of the\r\npeople, who certainly would not have dispensed with its celebration\r\nhad they recovered from the consternation arising from the great\r\nmortality. The king’s court was again deserted, and to the various\r\npassions and mental emotions which had been clashing there since\r\nthe year 1517, as, for instance, those arising from the theological\r\nzeal which had been excited by Henry VIIIth’s defence of the faith,\r\nwas added once more the old alarm and distress, which seemed to be\r\njustified by the death of some favoured courtiers; particularly of two\r\nchamberlains[532], and of Sir Francis Poynes, who had just returned\r\nfrom an embassy to Spain. The king left London immediately, and\r\nendeavoured to avoid the epidemic by continually travelling, until at\r\nlast he grew tired of so unsettled a life, and determined to await his\r\ndestiny at Tytynhangar. Here, with his first wife and a few confidents,\r\nhe resided quietly, apart from the world, surrounded by fires for\r\nthe purification of the air, and guarded by the precautions of his\r\nphysician, who had the satisfaction to find that the pestilence kept\r\naloof from this lonely residence[533].\r\n\r\nHow many lives were lost in this, which some historians have called\r\n_the great mortality_, can be estimated only by the facts which\r\nhave been stated, and which betoken an uncommonly violent degree of\r\nagitation in men’s minds. Accurate data are altogether wanting, yet\r\nit is quite evident that the whole English nation, from the monarch\r\nto the meanest peasant, was impressed with a feeling of alarm at the\r\nuncertainty of life, to which neither the rude state of society, nor a\r\nconstant familiarity with the effects of laws written in blood[534],\r\nhad blunted their sensibility. Such a state does not exist without\r\nvery numerous cases of mortality which bring the danger home to\r\nevery individual, so that it is to be presumed that the churchyards\r\nwere everywhere abundantly filled. Nor did this destructive epidemic\r\ncome alone. Provisions were scarce and dear, and whilst hundreds of\r\nthousands lay stretched upon the bed of death, many perished with\r\nhunger[535], and the same scenes would have been experienced as in\r\nFrance, had not the corn trade afforded some relief[536].\r\n\r\nAs soon as the occurrences of this unfortunate year could be more\r\nclosely surveyed, a conviction was at once felt, that _it was one and\r\nthe same general cause of disease which called forth the poisonous\r\npestilence in the French camp before Naples, the putrid fever among\r\nthe youth in France, and the sweating sickness in England, and that\r\nthe varying nature of these diseases depended only on the conditions\r\nof the soil and the qualities of the atmosphere in the countries which\r\nwere visited_[537]. If, in opposition to these notions, a narrow view\r\nof human life in the aggregate should raise a doubt, this would be\r\nstrikingly refuted by the wonderful coincidence, in point of time,\r\nof all these phenomena, occurring in such various parts of Europe;\r\nfor while the French army, after an exposure of four weeks to the\r\nmiseries and poisonous vapours of its camp before Naples, perceived\r\nthe first forebodings of its destruction, the great famine with the\r\nTrousse-galant in its train was in full advance on the other side the\r\nAlps, and almost on the same day the Sweating Sickness broke out upon\r\nthe Thames.\r\n\r\n\r\n              SECT. 4.—NATURAL OCCURRENCES.—PROGNOSTICS.\r\n\r\nThe chronicles of all the nations of Europe are full of remarkable\r\nnotices respecting the commotions of nature in these particular years,\r\nwhich were so utterly hostile to the animal and vegetable kingdoms. In\r\nEngland the period of distress was already approaching; towards the end\r\nof the year 1527. Throughout the whole winter, (November and December,\r\n1527, and January, 1528,) heavy rains deluged the country, the rivers\r\noverflowed their banks, and the winter seed was thus rotted. The\r\nweather then remained dry until April; but scarcely was the summer seed\r\nsown, when the rain again set in, and continued day and night for full\r\neight weeks, so that the last hope of a harvest was now destroyed[538],\r\nand the soaked earth, in the thick mists that arose from its surface,\r\nhatched the well known demon of the Sweating Disease. It was now of no\r\navail that the torrents of rain ceased, for the softened soil gave the\r\npestilence constant nourishment, and the damp warmth which, alternating\r\nwith unseasonable cold, remained prevalent during the following years\r\nall over Europe, rendered men’s bodies more and more susceptible to\r\nsevere diseases.\r\n\r\nThe historians of that time were too much occupied with the intricate\r\naffairs of the court and of the church to devote any attention\r\nto nature, and on this account they have left us no satisfactory\r\ninformation of the state of the weather and the course of the seasons\r\nof those years in England, yet there is no reason to suppose that they\r\nwere essentially different from those of the rest of Europe. This may\r\nbe proved by the following collection of important natural occurrences,\r\nwhen taken in conjunction with the circumstances already stated\r\nrespecting France and Italy.\r\n\r\nIn Upper Italy such considerable floods occurred in all the river\r\ndistricts, in the year 1527, that the astrologers announced a new\r\nDeluge. There was a repetition of them to an equal extent, and\r\nwith equal damage, in the following year, so that it may have been\r\nconcluded, not without some ground, that there was an accumulation\r\nof snow on the highest mountain ranges of Europe. On the 3rd of\r\nJuly, 1529, there followed a violent earthquake in Upper Italy, and\r\nimmediately afterwards a blood-rain, as it was called, in Cremona[539].\r\n\r\nIn October, 1530, the Tiber rose so much above its banks that in Rome\r\nand its neighbourhood about 12,000 people were drowned. A month later,\r\nin the Netherlands, the sea broke through the dykes, and Holland,\r\nZealand, and Brabant suffered very considerably from the overflow of\r\nthe waters, which again took place two years afterwards[540].\r\n\r\nIn 1528 there appeared in the March of Brandenburg, during the\r\nprevalence of a south-east wind and a great drought[541], (the rains\r\ndid not commence in Germany before 1529,) _swarms of locusts_[542],\r\nas if this prognostic too of great epidemics was not to be wanting.\r\nOf fiery meteors, which also frequently appeared in the following\r\nyears, and in the aggregate plainly indicated an unusual condition\r\nof the atmosphere, much notice, after the manner of the times, is\r\noccasionally taken[543]. Particular attention was excited by a long\r\nfiery train which was seen on the 7th of January, 1529, at seven\r\no’clock in the morning, throughout Mecklenburg and Pomerania[544].\r\nAnother fiery sign (chasma) was seen in the March on the 9th\r\nof January, at ten o’clock at night[545], as likewise similar\r\natmospherical phenomena in other localities.\r\n\r\nComets appeared in the course of this year in unusual number[546].\r\nThe first on the 11th of August, 1527, before daybreak; it was seen\r\nthroughout Europe, and it has often been confounded by more recent\r\nwriters with an atmospherical phenomenon resembling a comet which\r\nappeared on the 11th of October[547]. The second was seen in July and\r\nAugust, 1529, in Germany, France, and Italy. Four other comets are also\r\nsaid to have made their appearance this year at the same time; but it\r\nis probable that these were only fiery meteors of an unknown kind[548].\r\nThe third was in 1531, and was visible in Europe from the 1st of\r\nAugust till the 3rd of September. This was the great comet of Halley,\r\nwhich returned in the year 1835[549]. The fourth was in 1532, visible\r\nfrom the 2nd of October to the 8th of November; it appeared again in\r\n1661[550]. Lastly, the fifth, in 1533, seen from the middle of June\r\ntill August[551].\r\n\r\nContemporaries agree remarkably in their accounts of the insufferable\r\nstate of the weather in the eventful year 1529. The winter was\r\nparticularly mild, and the vegetation was far too early, so that all\r\nthe world was rejoicing at the mildness and beauty of the spring. The\r\npeople wore violets, at Erfurt, on St. Matthew’s day, (the 24th of\r\nFebruary,) little expecting that this friendly omen was to precede\r\nso severe a calamity[552]. Throughout the spring and summer wet\r\nweather continued to prevail. Constant torrents of rain overflowed the\r\nfields, the rivers passed their banks; all hopes of the cultivation\r\nwere entirely frustrated[553], and misery and famine spread in all\r\ndirections. A heavy rain of four days’ continuance, which took place\r\nin the south of Germany in the middle of June, and was called the St.\r\nVitus’s Torrent, is still remembered in modern times as an unheard-of\r\nevent. Whole districts of country were completely laid under water,\r\nand many persons perished who had not time to save their lives[554].\r\nA similar, very widely extended, and perhaps universal, storm again\r\noccurred on the 10th of August, and occasioned great floods, especially\r\nin Thuringia and Saxony[555]. Upon the whole, the sun rarely broke\r\nthrough the heavy dark clouds. The latter part of the summer and the\r\nwhole of the autumn, with the exception of a series of hot days which\r\ncommenced the 24th of August[556], remained gloomy, cold, and wet.\r\nPeople fancied they were breathing the foggy air of Britain[557].\r\n\r\nWe ought not to omit here to notice that in the north of Germany, and\r\nespecially in the March of Brandenburg, eating fish, which were caught\r\nin great abundance, was generally esteemed detrimental. Malignant and\r\ncontagious diseases were said to have been traced to this cause, and it\r\nwas a matter of surprise that the only food which nature bounteously\r\nbestowed was so decidedly injurious[558]. It might be difficult now\r\nto discover the cause of this phenomenon, of which we possess only\r\nisolated notices, yet, passing over all other conjectures, it is quite\r\ncredible either that an actual fish poison was developed[559], or,\r\nif this notion be rejected, that a disordered condition of life,\r\nsuch as must be supposed to have existed in a great famine, rendered\r\nfish prejudicial to health, in the same way as sometimes occurs after\r\nprotracted intermittent fevers, when the functions of the bowels are\r\ndisturbed in a manner peculiar to this disease.\r\n\r\nBut it was not the inhabitants of the water alone which were affected\r\nby hidden causes of excitement in collective organic life; the fowls\r\nof the air likewise sickened, who, in their delicate and irritable\r\norgans of respiration, feel the injurious influence of the atmosphere\r\nmuch earlier and more sensitively than any of the unfeathered tribes,\r\nand have often been the harbingers of great danger, ere man was aware\r\nof its approach. In the neighbourhood of Freyburg in the Breisgau,\r\ndead birds were found scattered under the trees, with boils as large\r\nas peas under their wings, which indicated among them a disease, that\r\nin all probability extended far beyond the southern districts of the\r\nRhine[560].\r\n\r\nThe famine in Germany, during this year, is described by respectable\r\nauthorities in a tone of deep sympathy. Swabia, Lorraine, Alsace, and\r\nthe other southern countries bordering on the Rhine, were especially\r\nvisited, so that misery there reached the same frightful height as\r\nin France. The poor emigrated and roved over the country, solely\r\nto prolong their wretched existence. Above a thousand of these\r\nhalf-starved mendicants came to Strasburg out of Swabia. They obtained\r\nshelter in a monastery, and attempts were made to revive them, yet many\r\nwere unable to bear the food that was placed before them. Attention and\r\nnourishment did but hasten their death. Another body of more than eight\r\nhundred came in the autumn from Lorraine. These unfortunate people\r\nwere kept in the city, and fed during the whole winter[561], yet it is\r\neasy to conceive that this benevolence, which was no doubt likewise\r\nexercised in other cities[562]—for when was humanity ever found wanting\r\nin Germany?—could only occasionally alleviate this deeply rooted\r\ncalamity. In the Venetian territories, many hundreds are said to have\r\nperished with hunger, and a like distress probably prevailed all over\r\nUpper Italy.\r\n\r\nIn the north of Germany, including the extensive sandy plains, on\r\nwhich wet weather is not so injurious in its effect as on a heavy\r\nclayey soil, the state of the country was upon the whole more\r\ntolerable[563]; yet, independently of the innumerable evils to which\r\na scarcity gives rise, _suicide was more frequent_[564], which was\r\ncertainly a rarity in the sixteenth century, and only explicable by\r\nsupposing, that the powers of the mind became exhausted by the many and\r\nvarious passions, which in every individual locality, excited a spirit\r\nof hatred and party feeling. The consequence of such a state of turmoil\r\nis a cold disgust of life, which finds, in the first adverse event that\r\nmay occur, a pretext for self-destruction, that want alone would seldom\r\nif ever occasion: for man, if his spirit be unbroken, runs the chance\r\nof starvation in times of famine, and trusts to the faintest gleam of\r\nhope, rather than, of his own accord, abandon the enjoyment of life.\r\n\r\nIt is no less in point here to notice a kind of faint lassitude,\r\nwhich, to the great astonishment of the people, was felt, especially\r\nin Pomerania, in June and July[565], up to the very period when the\r\nSweating Sickness broke out. In the midst of their work, and without\r\nany conceivable cause, people became palsied in their hands and\r\nfeet, so that even if their lives had depended upon it, they were\r\nincapable of the slightest exertion[566]. The treatment which was found\r\nsuccessful, was to cover the patients warmly, and to supply them with\r\nnourishing food, of which they ate plentifully, and thus recovered\r\nagain, in three or four days. Phenomena of this kind, which in the\r\npresent instance evidently depended on atmospherical influence, are but\r\nthe extreme gradations of a generally morbid dullness of vital feeling,\r\nwhich might easily pass into an actual disgust of life, such as would\r\nlead to suicide.\r\n\r\nThe following years were by no means all marked by a complete failure\r\nin produce. The year 1530 was, on the contrary, plentiful, there being\r\nonly some partial failures, as, for example, that which arose from a\r\ngreat flood in the district of the Saal, which occurred in the midst\r\nof the harvest time[567]. A very cold spring and a wet cold summer\r\nfollowed in 1531, with only occasional fine days; yet the ground\r\nwas not altogether unproductive, and the great distress which would\r\notherwise have been felt in Thuringia and Saxony, was checked by the\r\nestablishment of granaries, so that the people were not obliged, as\r\nthey often were in Swabia, to mow the green corn that they might dry\r\nthe ears in ovens, and support life upon the yet unripe grain.\r\n\r\nThe years 1532 and 1533, were again very sterile, as also 1534, in\r\nconsequence of the great heat and dryness of the summer. Finally,\r\nin the year 1535, the regular change of the seasons, and with it\r\na prosperous state of cultivation, seemed to be restored, and the\r\nscarcity ceased[568]. The reports from different localities in Germany\r\nvary much, but the scarcity prevailed for full seven years[569], (from\r\n1528 to 1534,) and since its causes were not discoverable, because it\r\nwas only seen by each observer in his own narrow circle, the old German\r\nadage was often called to mind: “If there is to be a scarcity, it is of\r\nno avail even should all the mountains be made of flour.”[570]\r\n\r\n\r\n             SECT. 5.—SWEATING SICKNESS IN GERMANY, 1529.\r\n\r\nThese facts are sufficient for a preliminary sketch of the background\r\non which moved the spectre of England, to which we now return. How\r\nlong the sweating sickness may have raged there after Henry the\r\nVIIIth quitted his secluded place of refuge in order to return to his\r\ncapital, no one has left any written account to show. That it spread\r\nvery rapidly over the whole kingdom is decidedly to be presumed, and\r\nmight probably still be easily ascertainable from the written records\r\nof different places. The notion that it did not rage violently in any\r\ntown more than a few weeks, is justified by corresponding phenomena\r\nof more recent occurrence, yet no doubt it continued to exist among\r\nthe people, though in a mitigated degree, till the mild winter season.\r\nBut there are not even the slightest data by which it can be made\r\nout that it was still in England during the summer of 1529. As an\r\nepidemic it certainly existed no longer, yet on a consideration of the\r\nstate of the air in that year, it is not to be denied that isolated\r\ncases of Sweating Fever may have appeared; for in pestilences of this\r\nkind, provided their original causes continue, there always occur some\r\nstraggling cases[571]. The Sweating Sickness did not advance westward\r\nto Ireland, nor did it pass the Scottish border; the historians, who\r\nwould certainly have recorded so calamitous an event, are entirely\r\nsilent respecting such an occurrence. The tragedy was, however,\r\ndestined to be enacted elsewhere; other nations were to play their part\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nHamburgh was the first place on the continent in which the Sweating\r\nSickness broke out. Men’s minds were still in great excitement\r\nthere in consequence of the events of the few preceding months. The\r\nProtestants had, after long and stormy contests, at length vanquished\r\nthe Papists. Under the wise direction of _Bugenhagen_ the great work\r\nof Reformation was just completed. The monasteries were abolished, the\r\nmonks dismissed, schools were established, and peace again returned\r\nwith the enjoyment of ecclesiastical freedom. Just at this moment[572]\r\nthe dreaded pestilence, of which wonderful accounts had been so long\r\nand so often heard, unexpectedly made its appearance. It immediately\r\nexcited, as it had ever done in England, general dismay, and before any\r\ninstructions as to its treatment could be obtained, either from the\r\nEnglish or from Germans who had been in England, it destroyed daily\r\nfrom forty to sixty, and altogether, within the space of twenty-two\r\ndays[573], about 1100 inhabitants, for such was the number of coffins\r\nwhich were at this time manufactured by the undertakers. The duration\r\nof _the great mortality_, for thus we would designate the more violent\r\nraging of this pestilence, was, however, much shorter, and may be\r\nroughly estimated at about nine days, for from the fragment of a\r\nletter received from Hamburgh, which was dispatched to Wittenberg on\r\nthe 8th of August, by a person who was at that time burgomaster, it\r\nappears that, for some days past, no one had died of the Sweating\r\nFever, excepting one or two drunkards, and that the citizens were\r\nthen beginning to take breath again. We may thus judge, from the\r\nunauthenticated account here mentioned, that the disease lasted about a\r\nfortnight longer, and that the loss of lives amounted to 2000. At all\r\nevents, however, the pestilence manifested itself on the continent with\r\nthe same malignity which was peculiar to it from the first, and if the\r\nassertion made at a distance respecting the mortality in Hamburgh, were\r\novercharged[574], yet there certainly existed sufficient foundation for\r\nexaggerations of this sort, which are never wanting in times of such\r\ngreat danger. The historians of this, even at that time, powerful and\r\ncivilized commercial town, have on the whole said but little regarding\r\nthis important event—a circumstance easily explicable from the constant\r\noccupation of men’s minds in religious affairs, and from the well known\r\nshort visitation of the epidemic, which, like a transient meteor,\r\nneeded quick and cautious observation if any valuable information\r\nrespecting the occurrence was to be transmitted to posterity. Some\r\nparticulars of its first origin have, however, been preserved amid a\r\nmass of general assertions which convey no information. Thus it appears\r\nthat the Sweating Sickness did not show itself in the town until a\r\nCaptain Hermann Evers, just about the time mentioned, (the 25th of\r\nJuly,) returned from England, bringing on board with him a number of\r\nyoung people, (probably travellers as well as sailors,) of whom at\r\nleast twelve died of this disease within two days[575]. According to\r\nanother account, those who died were not taken ill in England, but on\r\nthe voyage, and the pestilence broke out after the rest of the crew had\r\ndisembarked. On this point we have further a most respectable testimony\r\nto the fact, that in the night after the landing of Hermann Evers, four\r\nmen died in Hamburgh of the Sweating Sickness[576].\r\n\r\nIf we examine a little more closely these very valuable accounts, the\r\ncredibility of which there is no reason to doubt, it must especially\r\nbe taken into account, that at this time the Sweating Sickness had\r\nceased to exist as an epidemic in England for at least half a year,\r\nthat its appearance in single cases, although not contradictory to\r\ngeneral views, is nevertheless by no means borne out by proof from\r\nhistorical evidence, and that thus it is a gratuitous and unsupported\r\nassumption that the return of Hermann Evers’ crew was connected with\r\nany Sweating Sickness at all in England. If we consider, on the other\r\nhand, that the North Sea, even in ordinary years, is very foggy, so\r\nthat, owing to the prevalence of north-west winds, it precipitates very\r\nheavy rain clouds over Germany; and if we bear in mind, that in the\r\nyear 1529 it produced far heavier fogs than usual, we shall perceive in\r\nits waters the principal cause why the English Sweating Sickness was\r\nthen developed in its greatest violence, and we may thence assume, with\r\na greater degree of probability, that this pestilence broke out among\r\nthe crew of Hermann Evers spontaneously, and without any connexion with\r\nEngland, in the same way, perhaps, as it did formerly on board Henry\r\nthe VIIth’s fleet. This supposition is strengthened by the circumstance\r\nthat the ships of those times were excessively filthy, and the kind of\r\nlife spent on board them was, independently of the wretched provision,\r\nuncomfortable in the highest degree, nay, almost insupportable, so that\r\neven in short voyages, the scurvy, which was the dread of sailors in\r\nthose days, was of very common occurrence. Finally, we still possess\r\nthe most distinct accounts, that unusual occurrences took place in the\r\nNorth Seas. Thus during Lent it was observed with astonishment at\r\nStettin, that porpoises came in numbers up the frische Haff as far as\r\nthe bridge, and that the Baltic cast on its shores many dead animals of\r\nthis kind[577], so that we are fully justified in concluding that there\r\nexisted at that time a more intense development than usual of morbific\r\ninfluences in the marine atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWith respect, however, to the influence which the companions of\r\nHermann Evers, impregnated as they were with the odour of the Sweating\r\nSickness, had on the inhabitants of Hamburgh, it cannot be denied,\r\nthat their intercourse with those inhabitants, in the filthy and\r\nnarrow lanes of that commercial city, may have given an impulse to the\r\neruption of the pestilence, so far as to make the already existing fuel\r\nmore inflammable, or to furnish the first sparks for its ignition:\r\nyet it is equally undeniable that, under the existing circumstances,\r\nthe epidemic Sweating Sickness would have broken out in Germany even\r\nwithout the presence of Captain Evers, although it might, perhaps,\r\nhave been some weeks later, and not have made its first appearance in\r\nHamburgh, whose inhabitants, owing to the constant prevalence of the\r\nNorth Sea fog, were, to all appearance, already prepared for the first\r\nreception of this fatal disease.\r\n\r\nTo determine to a day when epidemics which have been long in\r\npreparation have broken out, is, even for an observer who is present,\r\nexceedingly difficult, nay, sometimes, under the most favourable\r\ncircumstances, impossible; for there occur in these visitations,\r\ncertain transitions into the epidemic form, of diseases which are\r\nallied to it, as well as a gradual conversion into it of morbid\r\nphenomena, which have usually begun some time before. Unless we are\r\ngreatly mistaken, such was the case in the pestilence of which we are\r\nnow treating; although it must be confessed, that we can obtain no\r\nprecise information on this point from the physicians of those times.\r\nThe following statements, for the absolute precision of which we cannot\r\npledge ourselves after a lapse of 300 years, must therefore be judged\r\naccording to this general experience; and though singly they may prove\r\nlittle, yet taken altogether, they are capable of demonstrating the\r\npeculiar and almost wonderful manner in which the Sweating Fever spread\r\nover Germany.\r\n\r\nIn Lübeck, the next city in the Baltic, the Sweating Sickness appeared\r\nabout the same time; for so early as the Friday before St. Peter _in\r\nvinculis_ (30th of July), it was known, that on the preceding night\r\na woman had died of it[578]. On the following days cases of death\r\nfearfully increased, and the disorder soon raged so violently, that\r\npeople were again reminded of the Black Death of 1349. The inhabitants\r\ndied without number, as well in the city as in the environs, and the\r\nconsternation was equal to that felt in Hamburgh[579]. In general, as\r\nwas everywhere the case, robust young people of the better classes were\r\naffected, while, on the other hand, children and poor people living in\r\ncellars and garrets almost all of them escaped[580].\r\n\r\nNow one might, either on the supposition of a progressive alteration\r\nin the atmosphere, such as occurs in the influenza, or on that of a\r\ncommunication of the disease from man to man, which, however, cannot\r\nbe considered as a principal cause of this epidemic, have expected a\r\ngradual extension of the Sweating Sickness from Hamburgh and Lübeck\r\nto the surrounding country. This did not, however, in fact, take\r\nplace; for the disease next broke out at Twickau, at the foot of the\r\nErzgebirge, distant from Hamburgh fifty German miles, and without\r\nhaving previously visited the rich commercial city of Leipzig. By\r\nthe 14th of August, nineteen persons who had died of it, were buried\r\nat Twickau; and on one of the following nights above a hundred[581]\r\nsickened, whence it is to be deduced that the pestilence was severe at\r\nthat place.\r\n\r\nPossibly the great storm on the 10th of August may have given\r\nan impulse to the development of this very remarkable epidemic;\r\nfor an highly electrical state of the atmosphere increases the\r\nsusceptibility for diseases. It is likewise not to be overlooked,\r\nthat on the 24th of August, while the sky was overcast, there came\r\non an insufferable heat[582], which must have debilitated the body\r\nafter such long-continued cold wet weather. At all events, in the\r\nbeginning of September, we find that the Sweating Fever broke out at\r\nthe same time at _Stettin_, _Dantzig_, and other Prussian cities; at\r\n_Augsburg_, far to the south on the other side of the Danube, at\r\n_Cologne_ on the Rhine, at _Strasbourg_, at _Frankfort_ on the Maine,\r\nat _Marburg_[583], at _Göttingen_, and at _Hanover_[584]. The position\r\nof these cities gives an impressive notion of the extent of country\r\nof which the English Sweating Sickness took possession, as it were by\r\na magic stroke. It was like a violent conflagration, which spread in\r\nall directions; the flames, however, did not issue from one focus, but\r\nrose up everywhere, as if self-ignited; and whilst all this occurred in\r\nGermany and Prussia, the inhabitants of the other northern countries,\r\nDenmark, Norway and Sweden, perhaps also Lithuania, Poland and Russia,\r\nwere likewise visited by this violent disease.\r\n\r\nThe malady appeared in Stettin on the 31st of August, among the\r\nservants of the Duke[585]. On the 1st of September, the Duchess herself\r\nsickened, in common with many people about the court, and burgesses in\r\nthe city. A few days afterwards several thousands were affected by the\r\ndisease, so that there was not a street from which some corpses were\r\nnot daily carried out. This dreadful period of terror, however, did\r\nnot last much longer than a week, for about the 8th of September the\r\npestilence abated in its violence, so as no longer to be regarded with\r\nterror; and after this time only a few isolated cases occurred[586].\r\n\r\nOn the same day, namely, the 1st of September, the disease appeared\r\nin Dantzig, fifty German miles further to the eastward, and was\r\nhere also so destructive, that it carried off in a short time 3000\r\ninhabitants[587], some say even 6000—but this seems certainly too high\r\nan estimate for Dantzig, and probably includes the greater part of\r\nPrussia. If we were to give credence to an anonymous reporter[588],\r\nthis plague abated _in five days_, and relieved the inhabitants from\r\nthe mortal anxiety which, until they recovered their senses, led them\r\neverywhere to commit acts of injustice and injury to avert the danger.\r\n\r\nIn Augsburg we find the Sweating Sickness on the 6th of September.\r\nIt lasted there also only _six days_, affected about 1500 of the\r\ninhabitants, and destroyed more than half that number, or, as it is\r\nsaid, about 800[589].\r\n\r\nAt Cologne it appeared precisely at the same time, as we learn from\r\nthe expressions of the Count von Newenar, a prelate of that place, who\r\nfinished his account of this disorder on the 7th of September[590]. At\r\nStrasburg it broke out some ten or twelve days earlier, namely, on the\r\n24th of August. In this place about 3000 people sickened in one week,\r\nbut very few of them died[591]. At Frankfort on the Maine they were\r\nholding the autumn fair (which began on the 7th of September) just at\r\nthe time when the Sweating Sickness prevailed[592], whence arose the\r\nopinion, which has been broached again in more modern times[593], that\r\nthe traders on their return carried the disease thence throughout the\r\nwhole of Germany, and that in the intercourse by means of this fair,\r\nthe main cause of the spread of the epidemic was to be found. After\r\nthe facts which have been brought forward, such a narrow view needs no\r\nrefutation. The Sweating Sickness was fleeter than the conveyances of\r\ngoods and people, which at that time made their way along the pathless\r\nand unbeaten roads; for “no sooner did a rumour of the approach of the\r\ndisease reach anyplace than the disease itself accompanied it.”[594]\r\n\r\nBetween the boundaries which have been indicated, only a few isolated\r\ntowns and villages escaped, and there are probably few of the\r\nchronicles of that age, so prolific of great events, in which the\r\ndreadful scourge of the year 1529 is not expressly mentioned; yet the\r\nsweating fever, like other great epidemics, spread, doubtless, very\r\nunequally, and it is ascertained that the further south it extended,\r\nthe milder it was upon the whole; and also that all those places where\r\nit broke out late suffered beyond comparison less than those which were\r\nvisited early in September and in the latter part of August; for not\r\nto lay much stress on the sultry heat from the 24th of August, which\r\nprobably did not last long, the chief cause of its great malignity at\r\nfirst was the violent method resorted to in the treatment of the sick,\r\nthe inapplicability of which was fortunately soon perceived. Only one\r\ncitizen was affected with the Sweating Sickness in Marburg, and even\r\nhe recovered[595], whilst at Leipzig, the pestilence either never\r\nbroke out at all, or very much later, perhaps in October or November;\r\nfor the physicians of that place gave it clearly to be understood in\r\ntheir pamphlets, that they knew nothing of the disease from their own\r\nobservations[596], and no sooner did the report get abroad that the\r\ndreaded enemy had not penetrated within the walls of this commercial\r\ncity, than crowds of fugitives came thither from far and near in order\r\nto seek protection and security, although the place in itself was by\r\nno means fitted for a place of refuge, for the swampy atmosphere which\r\nrose from the city ditches begot, even in those days, in the narrow and\r\ndark streets, many lingering diseases[597].\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SECT. 6.—IN THE NETHERLANDS.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the Netherlands were visited by the Sweating\r\nFever[598] full four weeks later, although the commercial intercourse\r\nwith England, if we were to attach any especial importance to this\r\ncircumstance, was far more considerable than that of the German cities\r\nin the North Sea. It appeared for the first time in Amsterdam on the\r\n27th of September in the forenoon, whilst the city was enveloped in a\r\nthick fog[599], and just at the same time, perhaps a day earlier, in\r\nAntwerp, where, on the 29th of September, they made a solemn procession\r\nin order by prayer to avert greater harm from the city; for in the\r\nlast days of September 400 to 500 people died of the English Sweating\r\nSickness at that place[600]. It might have been supposed that the damp\r\nsoil of Holland, and its impenetrable fogs, would invite the pestilence\r\nmuch earlier than the high and serene country between the Alps and the\r\nDanube, or the far distant land of Prussia, but the development of\r\nepidemics follows no human calculation or medical views! In the towns\r\naround Amsterdam the Sweating Fever appears not to have broken out\r\nuntil the mortality had ceased in that city, that is to say, five days\r\nafter the 27th of September, so that we cannot be far wrong in assuming\r\nthat in the latter end of that month, and the commencement of October,\r\nit had spread over the whole territory of the Netherlands including\r\nBelgium[601]. Alkmaar and Waterland remained free[602], as doubtless\r\nhad been the case with particular places both in England and Germany.\r\n\r\n_The exceedingly short time that the Sweating Sickness lasted_ in the\r\ndifferent places that it visited, was as astonishing as its original\r\nappearance. For since it raged in Amsterdam for only five days, and not\r\nmuch longer, as we have shewn, in Antwerp and many German towns, it\r\ncould hardly have continued more than fifteen days in any other places;\r\nthus displaying the same peculiarity on this occasion by which it had\r\nalready been marked in its former visitations. This short period,\r\nhowever, must not be understood to include the sporadic occurrence of\r\nthe disease, otherwise, as a contemporary of credit assures us, that\r\nthe sweating fever attacked some persons twice and others three or even\r\nfour times[603], we might thence conclude, that, although perhaps in\r\nsome places the pestilence did, after raging for a certain number of\r\ndays, suddenly cease, so that no isolated cases afterwards occurred,\r\nyet that the general duration of its prevalence was longer than has\r\nbeen stated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 SECT. 7.—DENMARK, SWEDEN, AND NORWAY.\r\n\r\nThe eruption of the Sweating Fever in Denmark[604], took place at _the\r\nlatter end of September_, for on the 29th of that month, four hundred\r\nof the inhabitants died of it at Copenhagen[605]. Elsinore was likewise\r\nseverely visited[606], and probably, about the same time, most of the\r\ntowns and villages in that kingdom. But the accounts on this subject\r\nin the Danish Chronicles are extremely defective[607], as owing to\r\nthe extraordinary rapidity of this mortal malady, contemporary writers\r\nneglected to record, for the information of posterity, the details of\r\na phenomenon, which there, as in other countries, must certainly have\r\nbeen striking from its general prevalence. Even from the imperfect\r\nnotices that were given respecting it, thus much, however, is clearly\r\nperceptible, that it was the same well-known disease as elsewhere,\r\nwhich was now observed to pass through Denmark. In proof of this, it\r\nwas principally young and strong people, as had been originally the\r\ncase in England, who sickened, the old and infirm being less affected,\r\nand in the course of four and twenty hours, or at most, within two days\r\n(?) the life or death of the patient was decided.\r\n\r\nAt the same period as in Denmark, the Sweating Sickness spread over\r\nthe _Scandinavian Peninsula_, and was productive of the same violent\r\nsymptoms in the sick, the same terror, and the same mortal anguish in\r\nthose who were affected by it, not only in the capital of Sweden, where\r\n_Magnus Erikson_, brother of king _Gustavus Wasa_, died of it, but also\r\nover the whole kingdom, and in Norway. The northern historians gave\r\ngraphic accounts of it, which, on a careful examination of manuscript\r\ndocuments, might perhaps gain still more in colouring and spirit[608].\r\nThat the Sweating Sickness likewise penetrated into Lithuania, Poland,\r\nand Livonia, if not into a part of Russia, we know only in a general\r\nway[609], but doubtless there are written documents still in existence\r\nin these countries, which only need some careful enquirer to bring\r\nthem to light. In the mean time, however, it is to be presumed, from\r\nthe early appearance of the disorder in Prussia, that it prevailed\r\nin those countries at the same time as in Germany, Denmark, and the\r\nScandinavian Peninsula. No certain trace is anywhere to be discovered\r\nthat the Sweating Sickness appeared so late as December, 1529, or in\r\nJanuary of the following year, so that, after having lasted upon the\r\nwhole a quarter of a year, it disappeared everywhere without leaving\r\nbehind it any sign of its existence, or giving rise to the development\r\nof any other diseases. Among these, it pursued its course as a comet\r\namong planets, without interfering either with the French Hunger Fever,\r\nor the Italian Petechial Fever, proving a striking example to all\r\nsucceeding ages of those general shocks to which the lives of the human\r\nrace are subject, and a fearful scourge to the generation which it\r\nvisited.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SECT. 8.—TERROR.\r\n\r\nThe alarm which prevailed in Germany surpasses all description, and\r\nbordered upon maniacal despair. As soon as the pestilence appeared on\r\nthe continent, horrifying accounts of the unheard-of sufferings of\r\nthose affected, and the certainty of their death, passed like wild-fire\r\nfrom mouth to mouth. Men’s minds were paralysed with terror, and the\r\nimagination exaggerated the calamity, which seemed to have come upon\r\nthem like a last judgment. The English Sweating Sickness was the theme\r\nof discourse everywhere, and if any one happened to be taken ill of\r\nfever, no matter of what kind, it was immediately converted into this\r\ndemon, whose spectre form continually haunted the oppressed spirit. At\r\nthe same time, the unfortunate delusion existed, that whoever wished to\r\nescape death when seized with the English pestilence, _must perspire\r\nfor twenty-four hours without intermission_[610]. So they put the\r\npatients, whether they had the Sweating Sickness or not, (for who had\r\ncalmness enough to distinguish it?) instantly to bed, covered them\r\nwith feather-beds and furs, and whilst the stove was heated to the\r\nutmost, closed the doors and windows with the greatest care to prevent\r\nall access of cool air. In order, moreover, to prevent the sufferer,\r\nshould he be somewhat impatient, from throwing off his hot load, some\r\npersons in health likewise lay upon him, and thus oppressed him to such\r\na degree, that he could neither stir hand nor foot, and finally, in\r\nthis rehearsal of hell, being bathed in an agonizing sweat, gave up the\r\nghost, when, perhaps, if his too officious relatives had manifested a\r\nlittle discretion, he might have been saved without difficulty[611].\r\n\r\nThere dwelt a physician in Zwickau—we no longer know the name of this\r\nestimable man—who, full of zeal for the good of mankind, opposed this\r\ndestructive folly. He went from house to house, and wherever he found\r\na patient buried in a hot bed, dragged him out with his own hands,\r\neverywhere forbad that the sick should thus be tortured with heat, and\r\nsaved by his decisive conduct, many, who but for him, must have been\r\nsmothered like the rest[612]. It often happened, at this time, that\r\namidst a circle of friends, if the Sweating Sickness was only brought\r\nto mind by a single word, first one, and then another was seized\r\nwith a tormenting anguish, their blood curdled, and certain of their\r\ndestruction, they quietly slunk away home, and there actually became a\r\nprey to death[613]. This mortal fear is a heavy addition to the scourge\r\nof rapidly fatal epidemics, and is, properly speaking, an inflammatory\r\ndisease of the mind, which, in its proximate effects upon the spirits,\r\nbears some resemblance to the nightmare. It confuses the understanding,\r\nso as to render it incapable of estimating external circumstances\r\naccording to their true relations to each other; it magnifies a gnat\r\ninto a monster, a distant improbable danger into a horrible spectre\r\nwhich takes a firm hold of the imagination; all actions are perverted,\r\nand if during this state of distraction, any other disease break out,\r\nthe patient conceives that he is the devoted victim of the much\r\ndreaded epidemic, like those unfortunate persons, who, having been\r\nbitten by a harmless animal, nevertheless become the subjects of an\r\nimaginary hydrophobia. Thus, during the calamitous autumn of 1529,\r\nmany may have been seized with only an imaginary Sweating Sickness,\r\nand under the towering heap of clothing on their loaded beds have met\r\nwith their graves[614]. Others among these brain-sick people who had\r\nthe good fortune to remain exempt from bodily ailments, many of them\r\neven boasting of their firmness, fell, through the violent commotions\r\nin their nerves, into a state of chronic hypochondriasis, which, under\r\ncircumstances of this sort, is marked by shuddering, and a feeling\r\nof uneasiness and dread at the bare mention of the original cause of\r\nterror, even when there is no longer any trace of its existence[615].\r\nA person thus disordered in his mind, was recently seen to destroy\r\nhimself[616] on receiving false intelligence of the return of the\r\nlate epidemic; thus betraying conduct even more dastardly than those\r\ncowardly soldiers, who, when the cannon begin to roar, inflict on\r\nthemselves slight wounds that they may avoid sharing the dangers of the\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nTo have a full notion how men’s minds were previously prepared for this\r\nstate, we have but to think on the monstrous events which took place\r\nin Germany. Twelve years earlier the gigantic work of the reformation\r\nhad been begun by the greatest German of that age, and, with the\r\nDivine power of the gospel, triumphantly carried through up to that\r\nperiod. The excitement was beyond all bounds. The new doctrine took\r\nroot in towns and villages, but nevertheless the most mortal party\r\nhatred raged on all sides, and as usually happens in times of such\r\nempassioned commotion, selfishness was the animating spirit which ruled\r\non both sides, and seized the torch of faith, in order, for her unholy\r\npurposes, to envelop the world in fire and flames.\r\n\r\nSo early as the year 1521, during Luther’s concealment within the\r\nwalls of Wartburg, false prophets[617] arose, and desired, without the\r\naid of their great Master, who was the soul of that age, to complete\r\na work with the spirit of which they were not imbued. They brought\r\nthe wildest passions into action, but, destitute of innate firmness,\r\nand incapable of curbing themselves, they became incendiaries and\r\niconoclasts. Immediately upon this the unhappy peasant-war broke out—a\r\nconsequence of the arbitrary conduct and oppression practised from\r\ntimes of old, for which the abettors of Dr. Eck’s sentiments would\r\ncharge Luther himself as answerable; not perceiving that it was the\r\nexcitement of the times and of the false prophets which had given\r\noccasion to the rebellion. Events occurred, from the recollection of\r\nwhich human feeling still recoils. Never was the fair soil of Germany\r\nthe scene of more atrocious cruelties; and after vengeance had played\r\nher insane part without opposition, the melancholy result was, that\r\nhundreds of thousands of once peaceful, and for the most part misled\r\npeasants, fell by the sword of the Lansquenets and of the executioner,\r\nwhile their numerous survivors became a prey to the dearth which\r\nvisited the country in the following years. The battle of Frankenhausen\r\non the 15th of May, 1525, and Münzer’s subsequent execution, closed\r\nthis bloody scene. The consequences of such intestine commotions\r\ncontinued however to be felt long after, and considered apart from\r\ntheir highly prejudicial influence on the prosperity of the people,\r\nconduced not a little to break the spirit of mankind, signs of which\r\nthe wise men of those times have plainly pointed out[618].\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SECT. 9.—MORAL CONSEQUENCES.\r\n\r\nThe dejection was increased by the universally active spirit of\r\npersecution with which it was still hoped to eradicate the new\r\ndoctrine. Even whilst the English pestilence was raging, two\r\nProtestants were burnt at Cologne[619]. In the same year faggots\r\nblazed at Mecklin, Verden, and Paris, by the flames of which the\r\nancient faith was to be protected against the pestilence of freedom\r\nof thought. Sentences of death were also quite commonly pronounced\r\nagainst the Anabaptists in Protestant countries. The University of\r\nLeipzig pronounced a condemnation of this sort in the year 1529, and\r\nin Freistadt eleven women were drowned after a nominal trial and\r\nsentence, because they acknowledged that they were of this sect[620].\r\nAmidst these dissensions, and when the empire was in this helpless\r\ncondition, came the fear of the barbarians of the south, who had\r\nalready conquered Hungary under their Sultan Soliman, and, whilst the\r\nEnglish Sweat was raging in the countries of the Danube, threatened to\r\noverwhelm Germany. It was a time of distress and lamentations, in which\r\neven the most undaunted could scarcely sustain their courage[621];\r\nbut to the everlasting honour of the Germans it must be acknowledged\r\nthat they withstood this purifying fire with unsullied honour, and in\r\na manner worthy of themselves. For their noble spirits were aroused\r\nto unheard-of exertions of energy, and whilst the pusillanimous gave\r\nthemselves up to despair, they impressed on the gigantic work of their\r\nage the stamp of imperishable truth.\r\n\r\nThe siege of Vienna began on the 22d of September, after the English\r\npestilence had broken out in this capital of Austria, yet nobody\r\nregarded this internal danger. The repeated attempts made by the\r\nTurks to storm the town were repulsed with great courage, and, on\r\nthe 15th of October, Soliman raised the siege, after the Sweating\r\nSickness had raged with as much violence among his troops as among the\r\nbesieged[622]. There is no accurate intelligence extant upon this\r\nsubject, because the pestilence was less regarded here than elsewhere,\r\nin consequence of the great distress of the country from other causes,\r\nyet the mortality in Austria under such unfavourable circumstances, was\r\ndoubtless more considerable than in the neighbouring states[623].\r\n\r\nIn the north of Germany another struggle was to be decided. The\r\nevangelical party wished to declare their faith before the empire and\r\nits ruler, to reveal the object of their efforts, and to defend the\r\npurity of their creed against danger and assault. For this purpose\r\nthey prepared themselves with wise discretion, and in the measures\r\ntaken by the reformers for the fortification of the great work, not\r\nthe slightest trace was to be observed of the anxiety which at that\r\ntime agitated the people. In the midst of a country whose inhabitants\r\ntrembled at the new disease, and were perhaps already severely\r\nafflicted with it, did Luther, whilst at Marburg[624], sketch the first\r\noutlines of a profession of faith, which, as filled up by Melancthon,\r\nhas become the foundation-stone of the evangelical church; and in the\r\nfollowing spring, during his stay at Cobourg, he composed his sublime\r\nhymn, “Eine feste burg ist unser Gott,” a strong fortress is our God.\r\n\r\nIt could not but happen that, in the religious struggles which took\r\nplace in these years, especial importance would be attributed to\r\nthe English pestilence. Epidemics readily appear to man, in the\r\nnarrow circle of his view, as scourges of God; and, indeed, this\r\nrepresentation of them has ever been the prevailing one in all\r\nreligions. For it is easier to estimate the ever-existing sins of\r\nhumanity than the grand commotions comprehending both mind and body,\r\nof a terrestrial organism, which can only be perceived by a superior\r\ninsight into things; and the mean selfishness of mankind and their\r\ndelusions respecting their own qualities induce them to adopt the more\r\neasily the partial view, that the Supreme Being allows pestilences to\r\nexist only to destroy their enemies of another faith. On this account,\r\nnot only do most contemporary writers speak of the just wrath of God,\r\nand of the chastisement thus prepared for the sins of the world[625],\r\nbut the papal party took every possible pains to represent the English\r\npestilence as a punishment for heresy and an evident warning against\r\nthe triumphant doctrines of Luther. The cases in Hamburgh, where the\r\neruption of the Sweating Sickness almost immediately followed the\r\nabolition of the monasteries, may certainly have obtained credit for\r\nsuch representations among the wavering and short-sighted, and, in a\r\nhundred other towns also, the Papists may have taken advantage of a\r\nsimilar occurrence of circumstances, for 1529 was a year when great\r\nand important questions were decided. At Lübeck, the monks in general\r\npreached that the English sweating fever was but a punishment which\r\nheaven inflicted on the Martineans, for so they called the followers\r\nof Luther, and the people were not undeceived until they saw with\r\nastonishment that Catholics also fell sick and died[626]. They went,\r\nhowever, much further, and did not hesitate to employ even falsehood\r\nand cruel revenge to gain their ends. Thus it was asserted that the\r\nmeeting of the reformers at Marburg, on the 2d of October, had led to\r\nno union among them, because a panic at the new disease had seized the\r\nheretics[627]. Never did a dastardly fear of death enter the heart\r\nof Luther, who, when the plague broke out at Wittenburg in 1527,\r\ncheerfully and courageously remained at his post whilst all around him\r\nfled, and the high school was removed to Jena. Moreover, as we have\r\nseen, the Sweating Sickness never once came near Marburg, and the union\r\nof the two evangelical churches failed on totally different grounds.\r\n\r\nIn Cologne the zealots were of opinion that they ought to endeavour to\r\nappease the visible wrath of God by the punishment of the heretics,\r\nand it was this sanguinary delusion, worthy of savage barbarians,\r\nwhich hastened the burning of Flistedt and Clarenbach[628]. To the\r\ncompletion of this picture of the times, many other minor touches might\r\nbe added, of which the following may be taken as an example. In the\r\nMarch of Brandenburg the evangelical faith, notwithstanding great\r\nobstacles, spread every day more and more, and the Catholic priests\r\nsoon found themselves deserted. Just as the Sweating Sickness broke out\r\nat Friedeberg, in the Newmark, a curate there delivered a sermon full\r\nof enthusiasm and passion, and endeavoured to convince his apostate\r\ncongregation that God had invented a new plague in order to chastise\r\nthe new heresy. A solemn procession, according to ancient usage and\r\northodox prescription, was to be held on the following day, and thus\r\nthe congregation was to be led back into the bosom of the only true\r\nchurch. But behold, in the course of the night, the zealous curate died\r\nof some sudden disease; and as mankind are ever ready to interpret even\r\nthe thunders of the Eternal according to their own wishes and narrow\r\nnotions, the Protestants, it seems, did not fail in their turn to\r\nrepresent this event as a miracle[629].\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECT. 10.—THE PHYSICIANS.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, the faculty had a very difficult problem\r\nbefore them, for the very imperfect solution of which they cannot\r\njustly be reproached. A learned and active physician is certainly one\r\nof the noblest of the diversified forms of humanity; for he unites in\r\nhimself the power arising from an insight into the works of nature,\r\nwith the exercise of a pure philanthropy inseparable from his office.\r\nFew men, however, of this ideal perfection lived in those times, and\r\ntheir mitigating influence over the violence of the epidemic, which\r\nwas generally past before they could closely examine their new enemy\r\nand give any deliberate advice, was doubtless but very inconsiderable.\r\nBy so much the more busy were the ignorant and covetous, who, from\r\ntime immemorial, the more numerous body in the profession, have always\r\ninjured it in its moral dignity. They attacked the disease with bold\r\nassertions, alarmed the people with inconsiderate representations,\r\nlauded the infallibility of their remedies, and were the promulgators\r\nof injurious prejudices. In the Netherlands, as we are assured\r\nby _Tyengius_, a physician whom we reckon among the learned and\r\nbenevolent, a vast number of patients died of the effects produced by\r\nthe distribution of pernicious pamphlets, with which the Sweating\r\nSickness was to be combated by those ignorant interlopers, who many\r\nof them gave it out that they had been in England, boasting to the\r\ninhabitants of their experience and skill, and with their pills and\r\ntheir “hellish electuaries,” flitting about from place to place[630],\r\nespecially where rich merchants were to be found, from whom, should\r\nthey be restored, they obtained the promise of mines of gold[631]. The\r\nlike occurred in Germany, where, at the commencement, the sound sense\r\nof the people was overcome by this officiousness, and violent remedies\r\nwere recommended as certain means of cure, in a deluge of pamphlets,\r\nsome of which were written by persons not in the profession.\r\n\r\nFrom this impure source was derived the prescription of the\r\ncompulsory[632] perspiration for twenty-four hours, which, in the\r\ndistricts of the Rhine, was called the Netherlands regimen[633]; and\r\nit is unpardonable, that the physicians, either with blind pride\r\ndisregarded, or were totally unacquainted with the prior experience of\r\nthe English, which advocated discretion and the most appropriate line\r\nof treatment. This neglect, which was not compensated until thousands\r\nhad already fallen, may possibly have arisen from the blameable silence\r\nof the English physicians, of whom, as if England had not yet been\r\nenlightened by the dawn of science, not an individual had written on\r\nthe Sweating Sickness, or proposed a reasonable line of treatment,\r\nsince the year 1485. Between England and Germany there existed,\r\nnevertheless, a constant intercourse; and it is incredible that that\r\nmode of procedure, which did not originate from a formal medical\r\nschool, but from the sound sense of the people, should not have become\r\nearlier known on this side of the North Sea.\r\n\r\nWe must not here overlook the habits and domestic manners of the\r\nGermans, for these favoured not a little the baneful prejudice with\r\nregard to heat, for which we would not altogether make the physicians\r\nresponsible. Housewives, even at that time, set far too much store\r\nby high beds, which annually received the feathers of the geese\r\nconsumed at the table. The comforts of a warm feather bed were highly\r\nappreciated, and least of all were they disposed to deny them to the\r\nsick. Thus all inflammatory disorders were stimulated to much greater\r\nmalignity, because such a bed either caused a dry heat, even to the\r\nextent of burning fever, or a useless debilitating perspiration. To\r\nthis effect the very extensive misuse of hot baths conduced; and no\r\nless so the custom of clothing much too warmly. Upon the whole the\r\nnotion was prevalent, as well with the people as with medical men,\r\nthat diseases were to be combated by warmth and sudorifics. To new\r\nepidemics, however, the prevailing notions and customs are always\r\napplied; for the great mass of mankind, among whom may be included\r\nmedical men, are entirely ruled by them; so that in this instance, the\r\nSweating Sickness fell upon a country in which its utmost malignity\r\nwould be called forth.\r\n\r\nYet after the first few days, in which many unfortunate cases occurred,\r\npeople became aware of the error they had committed. An advocate of the\r\ntwenty-four hours’ sudation, who, though not a medical man, had lauded\r\nthis practice in a pamphlet on the subject[634], died in Zwickau on the\r\n5th of September, the victim of his own imprudence. A few days after\r\nhim died an apothecary, likewise treated with the heated bed. Upon\r\nthis the physicians immediately abandoned the practice, directed that\r\ntheir patients should be sweated only for five or six hours, and in a\r\nmore moderate degree: and the estimable anonymous writer to whom we\r\nhave already alluded, thus seemed to meet with converts to his belief.\r\nIn Hamburgh also, men became convinced of the pernicious effects of\r\nfeather beds, and gave the preference to coverings of blankets[635];\r\nfor the English plan of treatment was presently known, and intelligent\r\nphilanthropists, who saw its curative powers, made it public[636] in\r\nall quarters, through the medium of their correspondence. In Lübeck\r\nthere lived at the time of the Sweating Fever a learned Protestant\r\nEnglishman, Dr. Anthony Barns, who, with great kindness, made known\r\neverywhere the English treatment of the disease. He was, however, after\r\nthe cessation of the pestilence, banished from the city, because he\r\nhad petitioned the bigoted Catholic senate to tolerate his Protestant\r\nbrethren. Many were saved by him; for it was the practice in this city\r\nalso, _to stew to death_[637] those affected with the disease. In\r\nStettin the English treatment was promulgated in good time, and two\r\ntravelling artisans who had come thither from Hamburgh, were of the\r\ngreatest assistance to the inhabitants of this city, by advising them\r\nto take the feathers out of their upper beds; they made known likewise\r\nhow the sickness had been treated with success. They had seen cases\r\nthemselves, and could therefore distinguish by their odour those who\r\nwere suffering from the true sweating epidemic, from those who were\r\nseized with fever arising from panic. They were constantly besieged by\r\npersons asking questions and seeking assistance; and when the disease\r\nwas at its greatest height, the streets were quite illuminated at\r\nnight by the lights of the relatives of the patients[638], who were\r\nrunning in all directions in a state of distraction. The abhorrence\r\nof feather beds, and the hot plan, now followed so quickly the blind\r\nrecommendation of the twenty-four hours’ sweat, that by the middle\r\nof September, and in many places still earlier, more correct views\r\nwere generally adopted, and some intelligent men, after the sad\r\nexperience which had been gained, seized the opportunity of doing more\r\ngood to the public than their noisy predecessors, who had by this\r\ntime so abundantly supplied the churchyards with bodies. Among these\r\nliterally and truly _beneficent_ physicians may be reckoned Peter\r\nWild, at Worms[639], who warned his countrymen against the Netherlands\r\npractice[640]; as also an anonymous person, (the names of the best\r\noften remain unknown in times of confusion,) who, in popular language,\r\nstrenuously dissuaded the people against the use of feather beds[641].\r\nIt also soon became a common saying, ”the Sweating Sickness will bear\r\nno medicine.”[642]\r\n\r\nThere is no ground for supposing that the influence of the faculty\r\nwas much greater in the country where the Sweating Sickness originated\r\nthan it was in Germany, for the number of learned physicians there was\r\nstill fewer, and the knowledge of medicine not nearly so extended as it\r\nwas in Italy, Germany, and France. The learned Linacre had already died\r\nin the year 1524. John Chambre[643], Edward Wotton[644], and George\r\nOwen[645], were the King’s body physicians about the time of the fourth\r\nepidemic visitation of the Sweating Sickness. William Butts[646] of\r\nwhom Shakespeare[647] has made honourable mention, in all probability\r\nlikewise held a similar office. These were certainly distinguished and\r\nworthy men[648], but posterity has gained nothing from them on the\r\nsubject of the English Sweating Sickness. All these physicians were\r\nwell informed, zealous, and doubtless also cautious followers of the\r\nancient Greek school of medicine, but their merits were of no advantage\r\nto the people, who, when they departed from the dictates of their own\r\nunderstanding, and did not content themselves with domestic remedies,\r\nto which they had been accustomed, fell into the hands of a set of\r\nsurgeons so rude and ignorant that they could only exist in the state\r\nof society which then prevailed[649].\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECT. 11.—PAMPHLETS.\r\n\r\nInexplicable as the silence of the learned physicians of England, on\r\nthe Sweating Sickness, appears at first view, (for where is the use\r\nof learning if it fail to throw any light on the stormy phenomena\r\nof life?) we may yet find, perhaps, its cause in a perfectly simple\r\nexternal circumstance. The reformation had not yet begun in England,\r\nthe Catholic Church still stood on its ancient foundations, and an\r\nintellectual intercourse between the learned and the people was not\r\nby any means among the acknowledged desiderata. The faculty would\r\nhence have been able to treat of the new disorder only in ponderous\r\nLatin works, for they wrote unwillingly in their own language, and the\r\nsubject could not seem to them an appropriate one for this purpose,\r\nbecause they found it unnoticed and uninvestigated by their highly\r\nrevered masters the Greeks. They were ignorant that a sweating fever\r\nhad ever appeared among the ancients, which, otherwise, might have\r\nincited them to make researches of their own on the subject; for\r\nAurelian, who describes it to the life, was either unknown to them, or,\r\nwhat at that time was a valid ground, was despised by them, on account\r\nof his bad (unclassical) language.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, on the contrary, the intellectual wants of the people\r\nand of the educated classes had already manifested themselves very\r\ndifferently. Twelve years before, the age of pamphlets had there\r\ncommenced. The thoughts of Luther and of his disciples, as also of\r\nhis opposers were winged by the rapid press, and the people took an\r\nimpassioned part in the endeavours of the learned to affect their\r\nconviction, and by this altogether novel and authoritative mode of\r\nreligious instruction, became gradually educated and guided. Hence\r\nit is not to be wondered at that people began to investigate, in\r\npamphlets, other important subjects likewise, and thus we see this\r\nweighty branch of intellectual commerce, with all its advantages and\r\ndefects, also turned towards the discussion of popular diseases, and\r\nfor the first time unfolding its numerous leaves on the subject of the\r\nEnglish epidemic. In the maritime cities nothing of this kind happened,\r\nbecause the eruption of the pestilence took them by surprise, and as it\r\nwas over again in the course of a few weeks, it seemed no longer worth\r\nwhile to instruct the people respecting it.\r\n\r\nThis surprise was very plainly shewn in the answer of the doctors and\r\nlicentiates who were assembled together at the bedside of the Duchess,\r\nat Stettin: “the disease was new and unknown to them: they were at a\r\nloss what to advise, excepting strengthening medicines.”[650] In the\r\ncentral parts of Germany, on the contrary, where, as early as the\r\nmonth of August, the report of the new plague had excited the utmost\r\nalarm, and where an eruption of the pestilence in Zwickau had caused\r\na general flight, publications on the Sweating Sickness were even\r\nwithin that month, and still more numerously in September, disseminated\r\nin all directions. As scientific productions, they are almost all\r\nof them worthless. Many of them, indeed, did harm, and but very few\r\npromulgated correct views. Most of them are now lost, as, for example,\r\nthat which was published by the printer Frantz, at Zwickau, on the 3rd\r\nof September: but in what vast numbers they were published appears\r\nfrom the circumstance that Dr. Bayer, at Leipzig, who brought out his\r\nown on the 4th of September, states that he has read many of them, and\r\nexpresses his indignation against these “new unfounded little books,”\r\nby which the people were misled to their own sorrow and suffering[651].\r\nThis same Dr. Bayer writes in the style of an intelligent practical\r\nphysician, inveighs boldly against the prejudices of mankind, and\r\nthe ignorance of medical _journeymen_, and against their senseless\r\nbleedings whenever they see the barber’s basin and his pole. Some of\r\nhis advice too is not bad, especially where he is speaking of the\r\nArabian use of harmless syrups. He, however, religiously preserves\r\nall the rubbish of his age, and has a great opinion of preventive\r\nbleedings, purgatives, and powerful medicines, of which he prescribes\r\nso many that his reader is necessarily confused by their multiplicity.\r\nHis precepts respecting the sweat are very appropriate, for he gives\r\na caution against forcing perspiration, prescribes according to the\r\ncircumstances, and even commences the treatment with an emetic, if the\r\nstate of the stomach seems to indicate its employment. In order to\r\nguard against contagion, he recommends, at the approaching autumnal\r\nfair, that foreigners from “_dying lands_” _should be accommodated in\r\ndistinct inns_, that fumigation should be carefully employed, and that\r\nbefore each booth at the fair a fire should be kept up.\r\n\r\nAnother pamphlet by Caspar Kegeler, of Leipzig, is a melancholy\r\nmonument of the credulity which, from Herophilus to the present day,\r\nhas pervaded the whole medical art. It is a regular pharmacopœia for\r\nthe Sweating Sickness, thrown together at a venture, without any\r\ninsight into the nature of the disease. A mine of wonderful pills\r\nand electuaries composed of numberless ingredients wherewith this\r\n“mysterious worthy” undertakes to raise a commotion in the bodies of\r\nhis patients. If he had but seen even a single case of the disease he\r\nwould at least have known how impossible it would be to administer,\r\nwithin the space of four-and-twenty hours, the hundredth part of his\r\npills and draughts. With what approbation this little pharmacopœia\r\nwas received by physicians of equal penetration and understanding as\r\nhimself, is shewn by the eight editions which it passed through[652],\r\nand the melancholy reflection is therefore forced upon us, that\r\npossibly thousands of sick persons were maltreated and sacrificed from\r\nthe employment of Kegeler’s medicines.\r\n\r\nA third physician at Leipzig, Dr. John Hellwetter, states in his\r\npamphlet, that he has become acquainted with the Sweating Fever in\r\nforeign countries, and on the subject of perspiration gives some very\r\ngood advice, evidently the result of his own experience, which reminds\r\nus of the original English mode of treatment. His notion that fish\r\nis injurious seems to have originated in the fact that the continued\r\nemployment of fish as an article of diet gives rise to offensive\r\nperspirations, and his admonition to his medical brethren not to flee\r\nfrom the sick, but to visit them sedulously and give them consolation,\r\nfurnishes ground for supposing that some of them had been pusillanimous\r\nand dishonourable enough to withdraw themselves or to refuse their\r\nassistance to the poor.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the medical men of those times were in possession of arcana\r\nwhich they employed either in all or at least in most diseases, in\r\na very unprofessional manner, and the efficacy of which the sweet\r\ndelusions of self-interest did not permit them to call in question. The\r\nsevere metallic remedies of the Spagyric school, which was then in its\r\ninfancy, were not yet introduced, but there were not wanting strong\r\nheating medicines from the ancient stores of the empyrics, which almost\r\nuniversally obtained the preference over the mild potions and syrups of\r\nthe Arabians. Hellwetter sold a powder of unknown composition, and a\r\nnumber of distilled waters, which Dr. Magnus Hundt, of Leipzig, notices\r\nwith much approbation. The pamphlet of this physician is in every\r\nrespect of the most ordinary kind; it affords no proof that the author\r\nhad any sound comprehension of the disease, and belongs to that class\r\nof low medical compositions which, in times of danger, is so easily\r\nderided by the public, and so much diminishes the estimation of the\r\nprofession, to the material injury of the general welfare.\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be supposed that the people, who in such times\r\nof commotion often confound together the good and the bad, listened\r\neverywhere so readily to these pamphleteers. The composition of one\r\nDr. Klump, at Ueberlingen, who, on the breaking out of the disease,\r\nattacked his patients with theriac and all kinds of heating plague\r\npowders, excited great derision[653], and it cannot be denied that the\r\npeople had on their side, at least occasionally, the advantage of sound\r\nsense, as opposed to the endless prescriptions of the physicians, and\r\nit is gratifying to observe how this sound sense, which doubtless was\r\nguided by respectable medical men, operated in a great many towns to\r\nthe advantage of those affected.\r\n\r\nThis is proved by a pamphlet, written in popular language, by a\r\nphysician in Wittenberg[654], which contains such correct medical\r\nviews, that our highest approbation is, even now, justly due to its\r\nunknown author, as shewing, throughout, great judgment and a very\r\ncompetent knowledge of the Sweating Fever. His whole treatment is\r\nmild and cautious; he forbids the use of feather beds, but strongly\r\ninculcates the necessity of avoiding every kind of chill, and therefore\r\nrecommends a practice in use at that time, called, “_the sewing of\r\nthe sick_,” that is to say, fastening the edge of the bed clothes to\r\nthe bed with a needle and thread. He orders his patients a moderate\r\nquantity of warm but not heating beverage[655], refreshes them with\r\nsyrup of roses, and impresses upon his readers that the majority of\r\nthose affected will recover without medicine. In order to guard against\r\nthe stupor which was so exceedingly fatal, in addition to continual\r\nconversation, refreshing odours of rose water and aromatic vinegar were\r\nheld before the patient’s nose, in a moderately damp cloth, or their\r\ntemples were cautiously bathed with them. Convalescents were watched\r\nwith great care, and it is not the least excellence of this very\r\nsterling pamphlet that it likewise combated the timidity of the sick\r\nwith the inculcation of mild, but manly, religious principles, such as\r\ncorresponded with the spirit of that age. The rules here laid down are,\r\nin essentials, the original English precepts which had already broken\r\nthe force of the epidemic Sweating Sickness in the year 1485, and the\r\nauthor does not conceal his having in this matter received information\r\nfrom Hamburgh, so far back as the 7th of August. That by this mode of\r\ntreatment not only individual patients[656] were saved, but also that\r\nwhole cities were protected against any very great mortality, we are\r\nwilling with the author to believe, and on this account we cannot but\r\nlament the more, that the medical science of the rigid schools of those\r\ndays so completely mistook its office as the guardian of life, and\r\nthat it caused greater sacrifices by its hazardous remedies than the\r\npestilence would otherwise have occasioned.\r\n\r\nHow soon the English treatment met with the recognition which it\r\ndeserved may be gathered from a Latin composition nearly of the same\r\ntenour as the above, and which appears to be an extract from some\r\nGerman pamphlets[657]. Besides aromatic odoriferous waters, the\r\nvery harmless and only remedies therein recommended are pearls and\r\ncorals given internally by tablespoonfuls in warm rose water. As a\r\nprophylactic, treacle, which was in very common use, was recommended to\r\nbe taken in the juice of roasted onions, but only in very small doses.\r\nSimilar just views with respect to the excitement of perspiration were\r\nalso subscribed to by other physicians[658], and finally the great\r\ncouncil at Berne, on the 18th of December, published an exhortation to\r\npatience and unshaken courage, in which the use of feather beds, and\r\nof all medicines, except cinnamon water, was earnestly deprecated[659]\r\nduring the disease. The court of Holland also recommended a method\r\nof cure[660] apparently English, these two documents being the only\r\ntraces, on the part of any governments, of a paternal solicitude for\r\ntheir subjects.\r\n\r\nThe learned and accomplished _Euricius Cordus_[661], of Marburg, had,\r\nwhen he wrote[662], no information respecting the successful English\r\nmode of treatment, and, with all his celebrity, only followed in the\r\nranks of ordinary advisers. He could not free himself from the medical\r\nprecepts which he brought from Italy and gave to the only patient\r\nat Marburg, who was the subject of the Sweating Sickness, the very\r\ndisagreeable, though much employed potion of “Benedetto.”[663] His\r\nprophylactic ordinances were very burthensome, though with respect\r\nto the frequent employment of purgatives, which at that time almost\r\nall physicians recommended, it must be taken into account, that the\r\nintemperance so prevalent in those days, rendered them in general more\r\nnecessary, perhaps, than they are at the present time. Bishop Ditmar of\r\nMerseburg, has betrayed to posterity, that this celebrated man had a\r\ngreat dread of the new disorder, and did not conceal his anxiety[664].\r\n\r\nThere is still extant a very complicated prescription of _Achilles\r\nGasser_[665], the learned physician of Augsburg, which he employed\r\nwith childish confidence[666] during the prevalence of the sweating\r\npestilence. We might class this with a thousand others of a similar\r\ncharacter, were it not evident how little medical art, at that time in\r\nits ancient Greek garb, was suited to the exigency of the age, being\r\ndull, inefficient, and long since robbed of its original spirit; for\r\nthus alone was it taught in the universities.\r\n\r\nIn the copious epistle of Simon Riquinus to the Count of Newenar at\r\nCologne[667], traces of better principles are indeed observable,\r\nwhich were soon disseminated from Hamburgh all over Germany, yet the\r\nprophylactic measures recommended are not much better than those in use\r\nin the time of the Emperor Antoninus, when the Theriaca of Andromachus\r\nwas among the necessaries at the Roman court. Riquinus incidentally\r\ntells a story of a peasant in the neighbourhood of Cleve, who, having\r\nbecome affected by the English Sweating Sickness, crept as quickly\r\nas he could into a baker’s oven that was still hot, and after some\r\ntime, again made his appearance in an exhausted state[668]. This very\r\ncircumstance proves that the man laboured under only an imaginary and\r\nnot a real sweating fever, but the belief that the bread which was\r\nafterwards baked in this oven was infected with the poison, can only be\r\nattributed to the credulity of the learned physician.\r\n\r\nThe Count of Newenar[669] expresses himself on the subject of the\r\nsweating fever, like a person well informed, and not unacquainted\r\nwith medical subjects, and endeavours to prove the critical nature of\r\nthe sweat by the frequent practice of the empyrics, to throw persons\r\nafflicted with the plague, at the very beginning of the attack, into\r\na profuse perspiration[670]. He takes the opportunity to relate of\r\nan unprincipled physician, that he freed himself in this manner from\r\nthe plague, in a public bath, while those who came after him became\r\nevery one of them affected with the disease and died. According to his\r\naccount, the English Sweating Sickness was by no means fatal in and\r\nabout Cologne[671], yet we find it with all its original malignity on\r\nthe banks of the Scheldt, and in the maritime towns of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nThis plainly appears from the pamphlet of a physician in great practice\r\nat Ghent, Tertius Damianus, from Vissenaecken, near Tirlemont[672],\r\nwhose own wife fell sick of the sweating fever, and fortunately was\r\nagain restored[673]. The cases whereof Damianus gives an account,\r\nare among the most marked of which any mention is made, and it also\r\nseems, that the disease, contrary to the opinion of many, arose from\r\nfear alone, and manifested in the Netherlands a much greater power\r\nof contagion than in Germany, to which the hot treatment may have\r\ncontributed[674]. The manner in which Damianus restrained his patients\r\nfrom indulging in their propensity to sleep, is worthy of notice. When\r\nthe usual means failed, he directed that their hair should be torn\r\nout, that their limbs should be tied together in painful positions,\r\nand that vinegar should be dropped into their eyes[675]: the danger\r\njustified these means, but violence does not easily attain its end. For\r\nthe rest, the views of this physician do not differ from those commonly\r\nentertained, and if he complains[676] of the great extortions of the\r\napothecaries, this was a natural effect of the customary prescriptions,\r\nwhereof he himself recommends many that are very objectionable.\r\n\r\nWhatever the science of medicine of the sixteenth century could oppose\r\nto so fearful an enemy, is set forth in the very excellent treatise of\r\n_Joachim Schiller_[677] of Freiburg, which, however, did not appear\r\nuntil two years later, and unfortunately does not give the wished-for\r\ninformation on the development of the pestilence in the Briesgau.\r\nSchiller is moderate in his views, and shews throughout, that he is a\r\nvery well informed physician, and well versed in Greek literature: and\r\nalthough he cannot steer clear of the rubbish of clumsy remedies, yet\r\nthe fault should not be charged on him, but on the age in which he\r\nlived. This, like every other, had its evils, and enveloped in clouds\r\nand darkness the genius of medicine, which, free, great, and elevated\r\nabove human short-sightedness, is respected only by the intellectual\r\nservants of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SECT. 12.—FORM OF THE DISEASE.\r\n\r\nThe notions of contemporary writers respecting the phenomena and\r\nthe course of the sweating epidemic are, it is true, individually\r\nunsatisfactory and defective[678]; yet collectively, we may gather from\r\nthem a lively and complete picture of its effect on the human frame;\r\nespecially from the German observers, who reported truly and honestly\r\ntheir own, as well as the general experience of their age; for the\r\nEnglish had up to that period described little more than the external\r\nappearances of this epidemic, which had already attacked them for the\r\nfourth time.\r\n\r\nIt is ascertained that the _Sweating Fever was in general very\r\ninflammatory_; and, leaving out of the account its sequel, _came to\r\na crisis at most in four and twenty hours_; yet, within this narrow\r\nlimit as to time, very various symptoms occurred[679], so that by a\r\nmore exact observation than could be expected from the physicians of\r\nthose days, several gradations of its development and violence might\r\nhave been distinguished from each other. Thus one form of this disease\r\nappeared that was wanting in precisely that symptom which was the most\r\nessential, namely, the colliquative sweating[680], (as in the most\r\ndangerous form of cholera, neither vomiting nor purging takes place,)\r\nand which, by its overpowering attack, either destroyed life within a\r\nfew hours, or perhaps took some other turn of a nature unknown to us.\r\n\r\nPremonitory symptoms were wanting altogether, unless we may reckon as\r\nsuch, first, an anguish, combined with palpitation of the heart, which\r\nmay not have been of corporeal origin, but may have proceeded from\r\nthe general alarm; or secondly, an irresistible sinking of the powers\r\nresembling a swoon, which, perhaps, preceded the disorder, in the\r\nsame manner as it had preceded the general eruption of the plague in\r\nnorthern Germany[681]: or thirdly, rheumatic pains of various kinds,\r\nwhich were frequently felt in the summer of 1529[682]; or finally,\r\na disagreeable taste in the mouth and foul breath, which were very\r\ncommonly the subject of complaint at that time[683].\r\n\r\nIn most instances the disease set in like the generality of fevers,\r\nwith a _short shivering fit_[684] and trembling, which in very\r\nmalignant cases even passed into convulsions of the extremities[685];\r\nin many it began with a moderate and constantly increasing heat[686]\r\neither without any evident occasion, even in the midst of sleep, so\r\nthat the patients on waking lay in a state of perspiration, or from a\r\nstate of intoxication, and during hard work[687], especially in the\r\nmorning at sunrise[688]. Many patients experienced at the commencement\r\na disagreeable _creeping sensation_ or _formication on their hands\r\nand feet_[689], which passed into pricking pains, and an exceedingly\r\n_painful sensation under the nails_. At times likewise it was combined\r\nwith rheumatic cramps, and with such a weariness in the upper part of\r\nthe body, that the sufferers were totally incapable of raising their\r\narms[690]. Some were seen during these attacks, especially women and\r\nthose who were weak, with their hands and feet swollen[691].\r\n\r\nSerious affections of the brain quickly followed; many fell into a\r\nstate of violent feverish delirium[692], and these generally died[693].\r\nAll complained of obscure _pain in the head_[694]; and it was not\r\nlong before an alarming _lethargy_ supervened[695], which, if it\r\nwas not firmly resisted, led to inevitable death by apoplexy. Thus\r\nthe unconscious sufferers were, at least, relieved from the pain\r\nof separation from their friends, which would have been much more\r\ndistressing to them in this than in any other complaint, since they\r\nlay, as it were, in a stinking swamp, tortured with suffering.\r\n\r\nThis mortal anguish accompanied them so long as they were in possession\r\nof their senses, throughout the whole disease[696]. _In many the\r\ncountenance was bloated and livid_, or at least the lips and cavities\r\nof the eyes were of a leaden tint; whence it evidently appears, that\r\nthe passage of the blood through the lungs was obstructed in the\r\nsame way as in violent asthma[697]; _hence they breathed with great\r\ndifficulty_, as if their lungs were seized with a violent spasm\r\nor incipient paralysis; at the same time, _the heart trembled and\r\npalpitated_ constantly under the oppressive feeling of inward burning,\r\nwhich, in the most malignant cases, flew to the head, and excited fatal\r\ndelirium[698]. In the course of a short time, and in many cases at\r\nthe very commencement, the _stinking sweat_ broke out in streams over\r\nthe whole body, either proving salutary when life was able to obtain\r\nthe mastery over the disease, or prejudicial when it was subdued by\r\nit—as is the case in every ineffectual effort of nature to produce a\r\ncure. And in this respect, as in diseases of less importance, great\r\ndifferences appeared according to the constitution of the patient;\r\nfor some perspired very easily, others, on the contrary, with great\r\ndifficulty, especially the phlegmatic, who, in consequence, were\r\nthreatened with the greatest danger[699].\r\n\r\nIn this severe struggle the _spinal marrow_ was sometimes, at a later\r\nstage, so much affected, that even _convulsions_ came on; and it\r\nhappened not unfrequently, that, in consequence of the constriction\r\nof the chest, the stomach indicated its excited condition by _nausea_\r\nand _vomiting_[700]. These symptoms, however, manifested themselves\r\nprincipally in those who were attacked with the disease upon a full\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nSuch is the testimony of the contemporary writers of 1529, to whose\r\naccounts but little is added by Kaye, an English eye-witness of the\r\nepidemic Sweating Sickness of 1551. The observations of this perfectly\r\ntrustworthy physician, so far as they relate to the form of the\r\ndisorder, may be here annexed, since no essential differences between\r\nthe diseases on these two occasions can be discovered. At the first\r\nonset the disease in some attacked the neck or shoulders, and in others\r\none leg or one arm, with dragging pains[701]; others felt at the\r\nsame time a warm glow that spread itself over the limbs, immediately\r\nafter which, without any visible cause, the perspiration broke out,\r\naccompanied by constant and increasing heat of the inward parts,\r\ngradually extending towards the surface. The patients suffered from\r\na very _quick and irritable pulse_[702] and great thirst, and threw\r\nthemselves about in the utmost restlessness. Under the violent headache\r\nwhich they suffered, they frequently fell into a talkative state of\r\nwandering, yet this did not generally happen before the ninth hour,\r\nand in very various gradations of mental aberration[703], after which\r\nthe drowsiness commenced. In others the sweating was longer delayed,\r\nwhile, in the mean time, a slight rigor of the limbs existed: it then\r\nbroke out profusely, but did not always trickle down the skin in equal\r\nabundance, but alternately, sometimes more, sometimes less. It was\r\nthick and of various colours, but in all cases of a very disagreeable\r\nodour[704], which, when it broke out again, after any interruption to\r\nits flow, was still more penetrating[705].\r\n\r\nKaye adds to what we already know of the oppression of the chest, the\r\nvery important statement that those affected were observed to have\r\na _whining, sighing voice_, whence we have every reason to conclude\r\nthat there was a serious affection of the eighth pair of nerves. He,\r\nmoreover, describes a very mild form of the disease, such as was\r\nprevalent in the south of Germany in 1529. It passed off under proper\r\ncare, without any danger, in the very short period of _fifteen hours_,\r\nand was brought to a termination by moderate heat through the medium of\r\na very gentle perspiration[706].\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that during this violent disorder neither the\r\n_activity of the kidneys nor the evacuation by stool was entirely\r\ninterrupted_, for there passed continually turbid and dark urine,\r\nalthough, as may be conceived, in small quantity and with great\r\nuncertainty as to the prognosis; whereupon those physicians who judged\r\nby the urine were not a little perplexed[707]. It was observed, too,\r\nsometimes in the more easily curable cases, _that patients at the\r\nmoment when the perspiration broke out upon them passed urine in\r\ngreat quantity_[708], on which account a French physician proposed to\r\ndraw off the water in those who suffered from this disease[709]; yet\r\nthis practice has no higher therapeutical worth than the excitement\r\nof perspiration in diabetes or in cholera, and is, moreover, much\r\nless practicable. That occasionally diarrhœa supervened, and even to\r\na degree which was not to be restrained, may be gathered from the\r\nfrequent medical directions as to how it ought to be arrested, which\r\nKaye also repeats[710]. In some patients, likewise, nature appears to\r\nhave effected a simultaneous crisis by the skin, the kidneys, and the\r\nbowels.\r\n\r\nMuch more important, however, is the observation of a respectable Dutch\r\nphysician, that _after the perspiration was over_ there appeared on the\r\nlimbs _small vesicles_[711], which were not confluent, but rendered\r\nthe skin uneven, and these were not noticed by any other medical\r\nobserver, but are spoken of by the author of an old Hamburgh chronicle,\r\nand, with this addition, that they had been seen on the dead[712]. By\r\nthese it is very likely that a _miliary eruption_, and perhaps spots\r\nalso, are to be understood; yet every thing militates against the\r\nsupposition that this phenomenon was constant, or that the Sweating\r\nFever was an eruptive disorder[713]. For in that case, some mention\r\nwould have been made of it in the numerous accounts of historians, many\r\nof whom, doubtless, had themselves seen the disease, and the eruptions\r\nwould have been more evidently and decidedly formed in the numerous\r\nrelapses of those who recovered. They certainly indicate a relationship\r\nwith the miliary fever, but only in so far as that both diseases are\r\nof rheumatic origin, and this slight participation in the nature of\r\nan eruptive disease would seem to have been observed in the English\r\nSweating Sickness only in perfectly isolated cases. What would have\r\ntaken place under such an indication had the Sweating Sickness run a\r\nlonger course, whether, in fact, it might not possibly have passed\r\ninto a regular miliary fever, is a question unsolved by the past,\r\nsince even later transitions of this kind have never been observed.\r\nThe two diseases are, both in their course and their nature, perfectly\r\ndistinct from each other, and the miliary fever was not developed as an\r\nindependent epidemic until the following century, under circumstances\r\naltogether different, and its more decided precursors are not to be\r\ndiscovered until a period posterior to the five eruptions of the\r\nSweating Sickness.\r\n\r\nThe powers of the constitution were much shaken by the Sweating\r\nSickness, so that a rapid recovery was observed to take place only in\r\nthe mildest form of this disease. Those, however, whom it attacked more\r\nseverely, remained very feeble and powerless for at least a week, and\r\ntheir restoration was but gradual, and effected only by great care and\r\nstrengthening diet. After the perspiration had passed off, the patient\r\nwas taken carefully from his bed, cautiously dried in a warm chamber,\r\nplaced by the fireside, and, as a first restorative, usually fed with\r\negg soup, yet the generality could not entirely get over the effects of\r\nthe fever for a long time. Those who had recovered could seldom go out\r\nso early as the second or third day[714].\r\n\r\nThose patients were placed in still greater danger _in whom the\r\nperspiration was in any way suppressed_: most of them were consigned\r\nto inevitable death, (the popular voice ever since the year 1485\r\nconfirms this.) Over those, however, in whom the powers of life were\r\nroused to a renewed effort, there broke out, after a short period, a\r\nnew perspiration far more offensive than the first; so that the body\r\ndripped as it were with a foul fluid, and it seemed as if the inward\r\nparts wanted to disburthen themselves at once of their putridity by\r\nan immoderate effort[715]. It is clear that this repetition of the\r\nattack must have been destructive to many who, had it not been for\r\nan obstruction of the crisis, would have been saved; for nothing is\r\nmore dangerous in inflammatory diseases than when those secretions are\r\ninterrupted which Nature has ordained as the only means of relief.\r\n\r\nRelapses were frequent, because convalescents, after the disease was\r\nsubdued, remained for a long time very excitable. These were seen for\r\nthe _third and fourth time seized with the Sweating Sickness_[716],\r\nnay, later writers notice _a repetition of the disease even to the\r\ntwelfth time_[717], whereby at least the health was completely\r\nshattered, for dropsy or some other destructive sequelæ supervened,\r\nuntil death put a period to incurable sufferings, and it is important\r\nto observe that even the bowels participated in the great excitability\r\nof the system, for _too early an exposure to the air easily brought on\r\ndiarrhœa_[718].\r\n\r\nHow great the decomposition of the organic matter was is convincingly\r\nproved from all the testimony hitherto adduced, but it might have\r\nbeen inferred from the very rapid putrefaction of the body, which\r\nrendered it necessary everywhere to use the greatest despatch in the\r\nperformance of burials[719]; and fortunately did away with all fear of\r\nbeing buried alive. Of post mortem examinations we have no information,\r\nand even if they could have been instituted, they would, from the\r\nmanner of conducting researches in those times, scarcely have thrown\r\nany important light on the disease. Hardly any physicians but those\r\nwho had studied in Italy knew the inward structure of the body from\r\ntheir own observation, superficial as it was; the rest learned it\r\nonly from Galenic manuals; how could they with such slender knowledge\r\nhave distinguished between healthy and diseased parts? Moreover, the\r\nSweating Sickness could not in so short a period cause such a palpable\r\nand substantial destruction of the viscera as they would alone have\r\nsought for. Details respecting the condition of the blood in the dead\r\nbody, which after such an enormous loss of watery fluid, such severe\r\noppression at the chest, and so great an impediment to the function\r\nof respiration, would in all probability be thickened and darkened in\r\ncolour, as well as respecting the condition of the lungs and of the\r\nheart, it would be highly desirable to obtain; but these likewise are\r\nwanting altogether, and after the lapse of so long a period there only\r\nremains room for conjectures.\r\n\r\nThe observation was repeated in Germany which had been so frequently\r\nmade since the year 1485, that the middle period of life was especially\r\nexposed to the Sweating Fever. Children, on the contrary, remained\r\nalmost entirely exempt from this disease, and when the aged were\r\naffected by it, it was as individual exceptions to a general rule[720],\r\nand this as it would appear, only during the height of the epidemic; as\r\nfor example at Zwickau, where a woman of 112 years of age was carried\r\noff by it[721]. We have already in part discovered the cause of this\r\nperfectly constant phenomenon in the luxurious mode of living of robust\r\nyoung men, and if we look back to the moral condition of the Germans\r\nin the 16th century, we find among them the same immoderate luxury\r\nas among the English, the same drunkenness, the same intemperance at\r\ntheir frequent banquets, where the wine-cups and beer-jugs were emptied\r\nwith but too eager draughts; finally, also, the same relaxation of\r\nskin consequent upon the use of warm baths and warm clothing. All\r\ncontemporary writers mention these circumstances[722], and our bold\r\nforefathers, with respect to these matters, were not in the best repute\r\nwith their southern neighbours.\r\n\r\nBut we have, moreover, to survey the disease in another point of\r\nview, namely, in relation to its peculiar character. In the outset we\r\ndesignated _the Sweating Sickness as a rheumatic fever_, and if we take\r\nthe notion of a rheumatic affection, as in propriety we ought, in its\r\nwidest acceptation, weighty and convincing grounds have been adduced\r\nin the course of our whole inquiry in confirmation of this view. When\r\nwe observe that those very nations were visited by the Sweating Fever,\r\nwhich are characterized by a fair skin, blue eyes, and light hair—the\r\nmarks of the German race, it may with justice be assumed, that even\r\nthis peculiarity in the structure of the body rendered it susceptible\r\nof this extraordinary disease. It is this which causes the proneness\r\nto fluxes of all kinds, and which makes these diseases endemic in the\r\nnorth of Europe, whilst the dark-haired southern nations and the blacks\r\nin the tropical climates remain, under similar circumstances[723], more\r\nfree from them. If it be remembered further how overcharged with water\r\nwere the lower strata of the atmosphere in which the pestilent Sweating\r\nFevers existed, what thick and even offensive mists prepared the way\r\nfor the disease and indicated its approach, what rapid alternations of\r\nfreezing cold and excessive heat took place in the summer of 1529; and,\r\nmoreover, how frequent all kinds of fluxes were in this very year, the\r\ncomplete form of the rheumatic constitution will be recognised in every\r\nindividual feature.\r\n\r\nDid we possess in the showy systems of modern times a maturer knowledge\r\nof the electricity of living bodies, much light would of necessity\r\nhence be thrown on the great object of our research. We should not\r\nthen be compelled to rest satisfied with the fact that a cloudy\r\natmosphere abstracts electricity from the body, robs the skin and\r\nlungs of their electrical atmosphere, disturbs their mutual electrical\r\nrelation with the external world, and by this disturbance prepares the\r\nbody for rheumatic indisposition, with all that peculiar decomposition\r\nof the fluids, irritable tension of the nerves, fever, and painful\r\naffection of particular parts, with which it is accompanied. If this\r\ndisturbance be represented according to certain new and inviting\r\nhypotheses, supported by some important facts[724], as being perhaps\r\nan accumulation of electricity in the interior of the body, owing to a\r\nmorbid, isolating activity of the skin, we may expect a more perfect\r\nknowledge of the nature of rheumatism through the medium of future\r\ndiligent researches; and until these be made, some evident signs\r\nof connexion between rheumatic affections and the English Sweating\r\nSickness will perhaps be sufficient to demonstrate the rheumatic nature\r\nof this latter disease.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the very great _susceptibility of those affected\r\nwith the Sweating Fever to every change of temperature_—the decidedly\r\ngreat danger of chill. In no known disease does this irritability of\r\nthe skin shew itself in so prominent a degree as in rheumatic fevers\r\nand in those non-febrile fluxes in which there even exists a very\r\nevident sensitiveness to _metallic_ action.\r\n\r\nSecondly, _The tendency of the rheumatic diathesis to come to a crisis\r\nthrough the medium of a profuse, sour and offensive perspiration_\r\nwithout any assistance from art[725]. The English Sweating Sickness\r\nmanifests this commotion of the organism in the most exquisite form\r\nhitherto known; for it admits of no kind of doubt that the sweat in\r\nthis disease was of itself, and in itself, critical, in the fullest\r\nacceptation of the term.\r\n\r\nThirdly, _The peculiar alteration in the fundamental composition of\r\norganic matter_ in rheumatic diseases, in consequence of which volatile\r\nacids of a strange odour are prevalent in the sweat, and urine, and\r\nanimal excretions. The English Sweating Sickness exhibits also this\r\nresult of morbid activity in a greater and more striking manner than\r\nany other disease. Nor can we regard the tendency to putridity, which\r\nhas been observed, as any thing but an increased degree of this\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nFourthly, _The shooting pains in the limbs_, the most decided sign of\r\nrheumatism, were not wanting in the English Sweating Sickness; nay,\r\nthey became developed even to the extent of an incipient paralysis,\r\nand even the convulsions of those affected with this disease may not\r\nunjustly be attributed to the same source.\r\n\r\nFifthly, _The tendency of rheumatism when it takes an unfavourable\r\ncourse to pass into regular dropsy_, which is a consequence of the\r\npeculiar decomposition, manifested itself in the Sweating Fever in so\r\nmarked a manner that the dropsy itself gradually destroyed the patient.\r\n\r\nShould the sceptical still need another link in the comparison, we may\r\nadduce the miliary fever, a disease of decidedly rheumatic character.\r\nWe must not, however, take as our standard the degenerate forms of\r\nmiliary fever existing in modern times, but those grand and fully\r\ndeveloped forms of the disease which occurred in the 17th and 18th\r\ncenturies, and in which we find a similar odour in the perspiration,\r\nthe same oppression, and the same inexpressible anguish, with\r\npalpitation and restlessness. The arms became enfeebled as if seized\r\nwith paralysis, violent pains of the limbs set in, and unpleasant\r\npricking sensations in the fingers and toes, resembling in all these\r\nparticulars the Sweating Sickness, only pursuing a more lengthened and\r\nirregular course, and becoming developed altogether in a different\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n_According to this representation, the English Sweating Sickness\r\nappears as a rheumatic fever in the most exquisite form_ that has ever\r\nyet been seen in the world, violently affecting the vitality of the\r\nbrain and spinal marrow with their nerves, without, however, at all\r\nmolesting the plexuses of the abdomen. _The immoderate excretion of\r\nwatery fluid_, which in the mild cases alone took place, through a\r\nspontaneous curative power, while in the malignant forms it betokened\r\nparalysis of the vessels and an actual colliquation, directs our\r\nattention further to the _consequent state of inanition_, which very\r\nprobably passed into a _stagnation of the circulation_, in the same\r\nmanner as takes place after every other sudden loss of the fluids,\r\nwhether from sanguineous effusion or evacuations by vomit and stool.\r\nHence the uncommonly rapid course of the disease, and partly, too, the\r\nfatal stupor[726]; hence, likewise, the very pardonable misconception\r\nwith respect to the nature of the Sweating Fever existing even in more\r\nmodern times. The sequela was more important and more fatal than the\r\noriginal rheumatic affection itself, which in its minor forms was mild\r\nand easily managed.\r\n\r\nAnd thus is explained the wonderfully fortunate result of the old\r\nEnglish treatment, which prevented this sequela, and avoided increasing\r\nthe already too powerful efforts of nature to effect a cure. We\r\nhave, therefore, nothing further to add to this judicious and truly\r\nscientific practice but our unqualified approbation; _for it is the\r\npart of the physician, in diseases which have a spontaneous power of\r\ncuring themselves, to leave this power free scope to act, and merely\r\nby fostering care to remove all obstacles to its exercise_. Should it\r\nbe the destiny of mankind to be again visited by the disease of the\r\nsixteenth century, (and it is by no means impossible that at some time\r\nor other similar events may recur,) we would recommend our posterity to\r\nbear in mind this eternal truth, and to treasure up the golden words of\r\nthe Wittenberg pamphlet, namely, to guard the healing art from strange\r\nand unnatural farragos, _for it is only when it is subordinate to\r\nnature that it bears the stamp of reason—the mistress of all earthly\r\nthings_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                FIFTH VISITATION OF THE DISEASE.—1551.\r\n\r\n    “Ubique lugubris erat lamentatio, fletus mœrens, acerbus luctus.”\r\n\r\n                                                                KAYE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECT. 1.—ERUPTION.\r\n\r\nFull three and twenty years had now elapsed; no trace of the Sweating\r\nSickness had shewn itself anywhere in this long interval, and England\r\nhad by its rapid advancement assumed quite another aspect[727] when\r\nthe old enemy of that people again, and for the last time, burst\r\nforth in Shrewsbury, the capital of Shropshire[728]. Here, during the\r\nspring, there arose impenetrable fogs from the banks of the Severn,\r\nwhich, from their unusually bad odour, led to a fear of their injurious\r\nconsequences[729]. It was not long before the Sweating Sickness\r\nsuddenly broke out on the 15th of April. To many it was entirely\r\nunknown or but obscurely recollected; for, amidst the commotions of\r\nHenry’s reign, the old malady had long since been forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe visitation was so very general in Shrewsbury and the places in its\r\nneighbourhood, that every one must have believed that the atmosphere\r\nwas poisoned, for no caution availed, no closing of the doors and\r\nwindows, every individual dwelling became an hospital, and the aged\r\nand the young, who could contribute nothing towards the care of their\r\nrelatives, alone remained unaffected by the pestilence[730]. The\r\ndisease came as unexpectedly and as completely without all warning\r\nas it had ever done on former occasions; at table, during sleep, on\r\njourneys, in the midst of amusement, and at all times of the day;\r\nand so little had it lost of its old malignity, that in a few hours\r\nit summoned some of its victims from the ranks of the living, and\r\neven destroyed others in less than one[731]. _Four and twenty hours_,\r\nneither more nor less, _were decisive as to the event_; the disease had\r\nthus undergone no change.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as the pestilence increased in its baneful violence, the\r\ncondition of the people became more and more miserable and forlorn; the\r\ntownspeople fled to the country, the peasants to the towns; some sought\r\nlonely places of refuge, others shut themselves up in their houses.\r\nIreland and Scotland received crowds of the fugitives. Others embarked\r\nfor France or the Netherlands; but security was nowhere to be found; so\r\nthat people at last resigned themselves to that fate which had so long\r\nand heavily oppressed the country. Women ran about negligently clad, as\r\nif they had lost their senses, and filled the streets with lamentations\r\nand loud prayers; all business was at a stand; no one thought of his\r\ndaily occupations, and the funeral bells tolled day and night, as\r\nif all the living ought to be reminded of their near and inevitable\r\nend[732]. There died, within a few days, nine hundred and sixty of the\r\ninhabitants of Shrewsbury, the greater part of them robust men and\r\nheads of families; from which circumstance we may judge of the profound\r\nsorrow that was felt in this city.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   SECT. 2.—EXTENSION AND DURATION.\r\n\r\nThe epidemic spread itself rapidly over all England, as far as the\r\nScottish borders, and on all sides to the sea coasts, under more\r\nextraordinary and memorable phenomena than had been observed in almost\r\nany other epidemic. In fact, it seemed that _the banks of the Severn\r\nwere the focus of the malady_, and that from hence, a true impestation\r\nof the atmosphere was diffused in every direction. Whithersoever the\r\nwinds wafted the stinking mist, the inhabitants became infected with\r\nthe Sweating Sickness, and, more or less, the same scenes of horror and\r\nof affliction which had occurred in Shrewsbury were repeated. These\r\npoisonous clouds of mist were observed moving from place to place,\r\nwith the disease in their train, affecting one town after another,\r\nand morning and evening spreading their nauseating insufferable\r\nstench[733]. At greater distances, these clouds being dispersed by the\r\nwind, became gradually attenuated, yet their dispersion set no bounds\r\nto the pestilence, and it was as if they had imparted to the lower\r\nstrata of the atmosphere a kind of ferment which went on engendering\r\nitself, even without the presence of the thick misty vapour, and\r\nbeing received into men’s lungs, produced the frightful disease\r\neverywhere[734]. Noxious exhalations from dung-pits, stagnant waters,\r\nswamps, impure canals, and the odour of foul rushes, which were in\r\ngeneral use in the dwellings in England, together with all kinds of\r\noffensive rubbish, seemed not a little to contribute to it; and it was\r\nremarked universally, that wherever such offensive odours prevailed,\r\nthe Sweating Sickness appeared more malignant[735]. It is a known fact,\r\nthat in a certain state of the atmosphere, which is perhaps principally\r\ndependent on electrical conditions and the degree of heat, mephitic\r\nodours exhale more easily and powerfully. To the quality of the air\r\nat that time prevalent in England, this peculiarity may certainly be\r\nattributed, although it must be confessed, that upon this point there\r\nare no accurate data to be discovered.\r\n\r\nThe disease lasted upon the whole almost half a year, namely, _from\r\nthe 15th of April to the 30th of September_[736]; it thus passed\r\nbut gradually from place to place, and we do not observe here, that\r\nit spread with that rapidity, which, in the autumn of 1529, had\r\nexcited such great wonder in Germany. It is much to be regretted,\r\nthat contemporary writers either gave no intelligence respecting the\r\nirruption or course of the epidemic Sweating Sickness in individual\r\ntowns, or, if they did so, that this has not been made use of by\r\nsubsequent writers. Doubtless, a very considerable diversity of\r\ncircumstances would here present themselves, and the very peculiar\r\nmanner in which the corruption of the atmosphere spread on this\r\noccasion, might perhaps have been estimated from certain facts, and\r\nnot from mere suppositions. Thus the only fact that has been handed\r\ndown is very remarkable; namely, that the Sweating Sickness required a\r\nwhole quarter of a year to traverse the short distance from Shrewsbury\r\nto London; for it did not break out there until the 9th of July, and\r\nin a few days, according to its former mode, reached its height, so\r\nthat the rapid increase of deaths excited terror throughout the whole\r\ncity[737]. Yet the mortality was considerably less than at Shrewsbury,\r\nfor there died in the whole of the first week only eight hundred\r\ninhabitants[738], and we may consider it decided, although all the\r\ncontemporaries are silent on this very essential question, that the\r\npestilence nowhere lasted longer than fifteen days, and perhaps in most\r\nplaces, as formerly, only five or six.\r\n\r\nThe deaths throughout the kingdom were very numerous, so that one\r\nhistorian actually calls it a depopulation[739]. No rank of life\r\nremained exempt, but the Sweating Sickness raged with equal violence\r\nin the foul huts of the poor and in the palaces of the nobility[740].\r\nThe piety which, in the general dejection, was displayed by the whole\r\nnation, giving birth to innumerable works of Christian benevolence\r\nand philanthropy, whereby undoubtedly many tears were dried up—many\r\norphans and widows protected from distress and want, is hence\r\nexplained: for this phenomenon, highly delightful as it is in itself,\r\noccurs only under great afflictions and a general fear of death, as\r\nwe are taught by the universal history of epidemics. We are willing\r\nto believe, to the honour of the English, that the religious impulse\r\nwhich they derived from their ecclesiastical reformation, may have\r\nhad no small share in its production; yet, unfortunately, such is\r\nthe nature of human society, that no sooner is the calamity over,\r\nthan virtue relaxes. Scarcely were the funeral obsequies performed,\r\nwhen every thing returned to the usual routine[741]; in like manner,\r\nthe Byzantines once, during a great earthquake, were seized with a\r\nfear of God, such as they had never before felt; day and night they\r\nflocked to the churches; nothing was to be seen but Christian virtue,\r\nself-denial, and works of benevolence, but these only lasted until the\r\nearth again became firm[742].\r\n\r\nThe very remarkable observation was made in this year, _that the\r\nSweating Sickness uniformly spared foreigners in England, and, on the\r\nother hand, followed the English into foreign countries_, so that those\r\nwho were in the Netherlands and France, and even in Spain, were carried\r\noff in no inconsiderable numbers by their indigenous pestilence, which\r\nwas nowhere caught by the natives.\r\n\r\nNot a single French inhabitant[743] of the neighbouring town of Calais\r\nwas affected, and neither the Scotch inhabitants of the same island,\r\nnor the Irish, were visited by the Sweating Sickness, so that we cannot\r\nget rid of the notion, that there was some peculiarity in the whole\r\nconstitution of the English which rendered them exclusively susceptible\r\nof this disease. To make this out accurately would be so much the more\r\ndifficult, because, in the original year of the Sweating Sickness,\r\nforeigners were the very persons among whom the English disease broke\r\nout; and again, because English persons who had lived a year in France,\r\non their return home in the summer of 1551, became the subjects of\r\nSweating Sickness[744]. Contemporaries, indeed, find a cause in the\r\ngluttony and rude mode of life of the English. In short, in all those\r\nremote causes with which we have already become acquainted, and which,\r\ndoubtless, also had their part in preparing the same scourge for the\r\nGermans and Flemings in 1529. Kaye, the most efficient eye-witness,\r\neven brings in proof of this view, that the temperate in England\r\nremained exempt from the Sweating Sickness, and on the contrary, that\r\nsome Frenchmen at Calais, who were too much devoted to English manners,\r\nwere seized with it[745]. To this alone, however, this susceptibility\r\ncannot be attributed, unless we would be content with the antiquated\r\nsystem of giving too much weight to remote causes, opposed to which we\r\nare met by the striking fact, that the Germans and Netherlanders, who\r\nhad scarcely much improved in their manners since 1529, were not again\r\nvisited by their old enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  SECT. 3.—CAUSES.—NATURAL PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to perceive, or rather we have no alternative but to\r\nsuppose, an unknown something in the English atmosphere, which\r\nimparted to the inhabitants the rheumatic diathesis, or, if we will,\r\nso penetrated their bodies, overcharged as they were with crude\r\njuices[746], that their constitutions had the so-called _opportunity_,\r\nthat is, were changed in such a manner as to fit them for the reception\r\nof the Sweating Sickness. Under such a condition, the common and more\r\npeculiar causes of this disease were not absolutely necessary, in order\r\nto induce its attack in a constitution thus long prepared for it, but\r\nthe general causes of disease were sufficient of themselves to give it\r\nits last stimulus, although this should be in an entirely different\r\nclimate, as in the present instance was the case with the English who\r\nwere living in Spain, and with the Venetian ambassador _Naugerio_, who,\r\nin the year 1528, fell ill of the petechial fever, when far from Italy,\r\nand living in France[747].\r\n\r\nIt has, no doubt, struck the reader that each of the five eruptions\r\nin England lasted much longer than the single one which occurred\r\nin Germany and the north of Europe. This, too, might well depend\r\nupon peculiarities in the English soil. But let us now endeavour\r\nto render manifest, by means of phenomena actually observed, that\r\nunknown something in the atmosphere of 1551, the θεῖον of the great\r\nHippocrates, which announces its presence by the sickening of the\r\npeople; for beyond this it is not granted that human researches should\r\npenetrate. The winter of 1550–51 was dry and warm in England; the\r\nspring dry and cold; the summer and autumn hot and moist[748]. The\r\nweather of the whole year was uncommon in many particulars, without,\r\nhowever, influencing the lives of plants and animals so much or\r\nthrough so great a range as at the time of the fourth epidemic of\r\nSweating Sickness. It was even in some places praised as fruitful[749].\r\nOn the 10th of January a violent tempest occurred, which in Germany\r\nleft no small traces[750] of its effects on houses and towers. The\r\nsame day brought considerable floods in the river district of the\r\nLahn, which must be noticed on account of the very unusual season of\r\nthe year[751]. On the 13th of January, again at an unusual season,\r\nthere followed a great storm with heavy rains[752], which spread over\r\nthe north of Germany; and on the 28th of January there occurred a\r\nconsiderable earthquake in Lisbon, whereby about two hundred houses\r\nwere overthrown, and nearly a thousand people were destroyed; whilst\r\na fiery meteor appeared, which, according to the unsatisfactory\r\ndescriptions of the time, resembled most a northern light, and\r\ntherefore was, in all probability, of electrical origin[753]. This\r\nwas succeeded in Germany by a great frost in February[754]. On the\r\n21st of March, at seven o’clock in the morning, two mock suns, with\r\nthree rainbows, were seen at Magdeburg and in its vicinity, and in the\r\nevening two mock moons[755]. The same mock suns were also observed at\r\nWittenberg, but without the rainbows. A similar phenomenon with two\r\nrainbows was again seen on the 27th of March[756]; and mock suns had\r\nbeen observed at Antwerp as early as the 28th of February[757]. About\r\nthe same time (21st of March) the Oder overflowed its banks[758],\r\nand floods followed after continued rains during the month of May in\r\nThuringia and Franconia[759]. Great tempests were not wanting[760],\r\nand, after considerable heat, there occurred, on the 26th of June,\r\na thick summer fog in the districts of the Elbe which deprived the\r\nbesiegers of Magdeburg of the sight of that city. It may, therefore, be\r\nsupposed that this phenomenon took place throughout a greater extent\r\nof country[761]. On the 22nd of September a meteor, like a northern\r\nlight, was again seen, and on the 29th of that month, after some clear\r\nweather, a heavy fall of snow was followed by continued cold[762].\r\n\r\nThese facts are sufficient plainly to prove that the course of the\r\nyear 1551 was unusual, that the atmosphere was overcharged with water,\r\nand that the electrical conditions of it were considerably disturbed;\r\nnor must we omit to notice that, for the first time since 1547, mould\r\nspots again appeared in Germany on clothes, and red discolorations of\r\nwater, as likewise an exuberance of the lowest cryptogamic species of\r\nvegetation[763].\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECT. 4.—DISEASES.\r\n\r\nDuring the years of scarcity, from 1528 to 1534, it excited general\r\nsurprise that malignant fevers, more especially the plague, petechial\r\nfever, and encephalitis, which in the individual accounts we can seldom\r\nsufficiently distinguish from each other, were constantly recurring,\r\nand, creeping slowly as they did from place to place, had no sooner\r\nfinished their wandering visitations of whole districts of country,\r\nthan they again made their appearance where they had broken out in\r\nformer years[764]. It was _a century of putrid malignant affections_,\r\nin which typhous diseases were continually prevailing—a century replete\r\nwith grand phenomena affecting human life in general, and continuing\r\nso, long after the period to which our researches refer.\r\n\r\nThere existed also an epidemic flux which, during a cold summer[765]\r\nin 1538, spread over a great part of Europe, and especially over\r\nFrance, so that, according to the assurance of an eminent physician,\r\nthere was scarcely any town exempt from it[766]. Of this flux we have\r\nunfortunately but very defective reports, among which we find a\r\nstatement, not without importance, that there were no extraordinary\r\nforerunners, such as are observed in phenomena of this kind, to\r\naccount for this epidemic[767]. Two years earlier, however, (12th of\r\nJuly 1536,) Erasmus died of the flux[768]. This disease seldom occurs\r\nsporadically, but usually as an epidemic, and thus, perhaps slighter\r\nvisitations of this rheumatic malady may be assumed to have preceded\r\nthat greater one which took place in 1538.\r\n\r\nA period remarkable for plague followed in the year 1540, and ended\r\nabout 1543. The summer of the first named year is especially mentioned\r\nin the chronicles as having been _hot_, and throughout the whole\r\ncentury it continued to be in great repute on account of the excellent\r\nwine it produced[769]. A spontaneous conflagration of the woods\r\nwas frequent, and an earthquake was felt in Germany on the 14th of\r\nDecember[770]. Thereupon, in 1541, there followed in Constantinople\r\na great plague[771] which, in the year 1542, spread by means of a\r\nTurkish invasion into Hungary, its superior importance being indicated\r\nby the presence of accompanying phenomena, among which the swarms of\r\nlocusts that appeared this year are especially worthy of note. They\r\ncame from the interior of Asia, and travelled in dense masses over\r\nEurope, passing northward over the Elbe[772], and southward as far as\r\nSpain[773]. Kaye saw a cloud of locusts of this description in Padua;\r\ntheir passage lasted full two hours, and they extended further than the\r\neye could reach[774]. The plague quickly spread in Hungary and caused\r\na similar destruction to the imperial army, which was fighting against\r\nthe Turks under Joachim the Second, Elector of Brandenburg, as it had\r\nformerly caused the French before Naples[775]. Whether this pestilence\r\nmay have been the original oriental glandular plague, or whether we may\r\nassume that it had already degenerated into the _Hungarian Petechial\r\nFever_, such as likewise broke out in the year 1566, in the camp near\r\nKomorn, during the campaign of Maximilian the Second, and thence, by\r\nmeans of the disbanded lansquenets, spread in all directions[776],\r\ncannot now well be determined for want of ascertained facts. In the\r\nfollowing year, 1543, however, this plague broke out in Germany,\r\nnamely, in the Harz districts in the provinces of the Saale[777], and\r\nstill more malignantly at Metz[778], yet upon the whole it did not\r\ncause any considerable loss of life.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1545 and 1546 we again find the _Trousse-galant_ in\r\nFrance[779]. It proved fatal to the Duke of Orleans, second son of\r\nFrancis the First, in the neighbourhood of Boulogne, and, according to\r\nthe testimony of French historians, to ten thousand English in that\r\nfort, so that the garrison was obliged to pitch a camp outside the\r\ntown, and the reluctant reinforcements felt that they were encountering\r\ncertain death[780]. The disease spread itself also among the French\r\ntroops, and we have seen that it extended its dominion beyond the Alps\r\nof Savoy[781].\r\n\r\nIt thus appears, that, up to the period of which we have been speaking,\r\nthe year 1544 alone was free from great visitations of disease, but\r\nit would be difficult from thenceforth satisfactorily to define the\r\nindividual groups of epidemics, if the connexion of the epidemic\r\nSweating Sickness of the year 1551 with them is to be made out; for\r\nthere was, to use an expression of the schools, a continued _typhous\r\nconstitution_, which extended throughout this whole period, manifesting\r\nitself on the slightest causes by malignant diseases; so that the\r\nvisitations of sickness which we have hitherto been describing do but\r\nappear as exacerbations of them, with a predominance sometimes of one\r\nand sometimes of another set of symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe camp fever, which prevailed in the spring of 1547 among the\r\nimperial troops, there is good ground for considering to have been\r\npetechial. A great many soldiers fell sick of it, and it was so much\r\nthe more malignant because the imperial army was composed of a variety\r\nof soldiery, Spaniards, Germans, Hungarians, and Bohemians. Those who\r\nwere seized complained, as in encephalitis, of insufferable heat of\r\nthe head, their eyes were swollen and started glistening from their\r\nsockets, their offensive breath poisoned the atmosphere around them,\r\ntheir tongues were covered with a brown crust, they vomited bile, their\r\nskin was of a leaden hue, and a deep purple eruption broke forth upon\r\nit. The disease, the fresh seeds of which the imperial hussars had\r\nbrought with them out of Hungary, proved fatal as early as the second\r\nor third day, and it may be taken for granted, that both before and\r\nafter the battle of Muhlberg (24th of April) it made no small ravages\r\nin Saxony[782]; yet it did not become general.\r\n\r\nAfter a short interval the unusual phenomena of 1549 again increased;\r\nthe chronicles of central Germany record blights and murrains in that\r\nyear. They speak likewise of a northern light seen on the 21st of\r\nSeptember, and of a malignant disease which, till the winter set in,\r\ncarried off young people in no small numbers[783]. According to all\r\nappearance this disease was a petechial fever, which in the following\r\nyear, 1550, likewise visited the March of Brandenburg, Thuringia and\r\nSaxony[784]. The mortality was particularly great at Eisleben, where,\r\nin less than four weeks from the 14th September, 257 fell a sacrifice\r\nto it, and after this period it happened often that from twenty to\r\ntwenty-four bodies were buried in one day; so that the loss in this\r\nlittle town may be reckoned at least at 500[785]. From this slight\r\nexample the great malignity of the plagues of the sixteenth century\r\nwill be perceived, and it would be still more evident if the physicians\r\nof those times had made more careful observations, and historians had\r\nmore accurately recorded facts of this kind.\r\n\r\nIn 1551 there prevailed in Swabia a disease of the nature of plague,\r\nwhich determined the Duke Christoph, of Würtemburg, to withdraw\r\nhimself from Stuttgard. It did not spread, and seems to have remained\r\nunknown to the rest of Germany[786]. In Spain, too, the plague[787]\r\nshewed itself, and if to this be added the influenza of the same\r\nyear[788], as well as the numerous cases of malignant fevers in Germany\r\nand Switzerland, which were spoken of as still existing in the two\r\nfollowing years[789], it will again be seen quite evidently that _the\r\nfifth epidemic Sweating Sickness_ _appeared, accompanied by a group of\r\nvarious epidemic diseases, which might be considered as resulting from\r\ngeneral influences_. The disease which is the subject of our research\r\nthus took its departure from Europe similarly accompanied as when it\r\noriginally sprang up there, while in the interval it thrice repeated\r\nits deadly attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECT. 5.—JOHN KAYE.\r\n\r\nLet us dedicate a few moments to the observer of the fifth sweating\r\npestilence, whose life presents a lively image of the peculiarities and\r\ntendencies of his age. He was born at Norwich on the 6th of October,\r\n1510, and received his education at Gonville Hall, Cambridge. He had\r\nearly evinced by some productions his great knowledge of the Greek\r\nlanguage, and his zeal for theological investigations. At a maturer\r\nage he went to Italy, at that time the seat of scientific learning,\r\nwhere _Baptista Montanus_ and _Vesalius_, at Padua, initiated him in\r\nthe healing art. He took his Doctor’s degree at Bologna, and in 1542 he\r\nlectured on Aristotle in conjunction with Realdus Columbus, with great\r\napprobation. The following year he travelled throughout Italy, and with\r\nmuch diligence collated manuscripts for the emendation of Galen and\r\nCelsus, attended the prælections of Matthæus Curtius at Pisa, and then\r\nreturned through France and Germany to his own country.\r\n\r\nAfter being admitted as a doctor of medicine at Cambridge, he practised\r\nwith great distinction at Shrewsbury and Norwich, but was soon summoned\r\nby Henry the Eighth to deliver anatomical lectures to the surgeons in\r\nLondon. He was much honoured at the court of Edward the Sixth, and the\r\nappointment of body physician, which this monarch bestowed on him, he\r\nretained also under Queen Mary and Elizabeth. In 1547, he became a\r\nFellow of the College of Physicians, over which, at a later period,\r\nhe presided for seven years. He constantly supported the honour of\r\nthis body with great zeal, compiled its Annals from the period of\r\nits foundation by Linacre to the end of his own presidentship, and\r\noriginated an establishment, the first of the kind in England[790], for\r\nannually performing two public dissections of human bodies.\r\n\r\nThat he was thus established in London before the year 1551 is certain,\r\nyet he was present in Shrewsbury, during the Sweating Sickness. His\r\npamphlet[791] upon this disease, the first and last published in\r\nEngland, did not, however, appear before 1552, after all was over. It\r\nis written in strong language and a popular style, and with a laudable\r\nfrankness; for Kaye blames in it, without any reserve, the gross\r\nmode of living of his countrymen, and does not fatigue his reader\r\nwith too much book learning, which neither he nor his contemporaries\r\ncould refrain from displaying on other occasions. He reserved this\r\nfor the Latin version of his pamphlet, which was published four years\r\nlater[792], and although, judged according to a modern standard, it is\r\nfar from being satisfactory, yet it contains an abundance of valuable\r\nmatter, and proves its author to be a good observer; and in this we\r\ncan nowhere mistake that he is an Englishman of the sixteenth century,\r\nhowever numerous the terms he may borrow from Celsus. His doctrines\r\nare of the old Greek school throughout, of which the physicians of\r\nthose times were staunch supporters; hence the term _ephemera[793]\r\npestilens_, his comparison of the disease with the similar fevers of\r\nthe ancients[794], and his accurate appreciation of the important\r\ndoctrine of æthereal spirits, to which he refers its chief causes,\r\nand, according to which, the corrupted atmosphere (spiritus corrupti)\r\nbecomes mixed in the lungs with the spirits of blood, (spiritus\r\nsanguinis,) whence it at once appears explicable to him, why many\r\npersons may be attacked with the Sweating Sickness at the same time,\r\nand even in different places, and why the parts of the body in which,\r\naccording to the ancient Greek notion, the æthereal spirits developed\r\nthemselves, were most violently affected with this disease[795]. From\r\nthe relationship of the infected air to the æthereal spirits in the\r\nbody, polluted by intemperance, it also appears explicable to him, why\r\nforeigners in England, in whom this pollution took place in a less\r\ndegree, were, only in cases of individual exception, attacked by the\r\nSweating Sickness[796], not to mention other theoretical notions.\r\n\r\nOn malaria in general, as he was an observant naturalist, he was\r\nenabled to turn to good account his experience in Italy and his\r\nknowledge of the ancients, and his estimation of the subordinate\r\ncauses, with regard to which he takes up the same position as Agricola,\r\nwho was also a good naturalist, is likewise on the whole worthy of\r\napprobation[797]. The immoderate use of beer, amongst the English, was\r\nconsidered by many as the principal reason why the Sweating Sickness\r\nwas confined to this nation. On this subject he enlarges even to\r\nprolixity, with evident English predilection for this beverage which\r\nmanifestly contributed to the morbid repletion of the people; and\r\nhe himself acknowledged this as a principal cause of the Sweating\r\nSickness. The injurious quality of salt-fish, as alleged by Erasmus\r\nand the German physician Hellwetter[798], he would not altogether have\r\nventured to reject[799], for it caused constant and abundant fetid\r\nperspirations, and might thus have contributed to pave the way for the\r\nSweating Sickness. A similar source was to be found in the dirty rush\r\nfloors in the English houses[800], and other subordinate causes of the\r\ndisease of which mention has been made in the course of this treatise.\r\n\r\nAs a zealous advocate of temperance, it were to be wished that he had\r\nmet with more attention; but the words of a good physician are given\r\nto the winds, when they are directed against vices and habits of\r\nsensual indulgence; people require from him an infallible preservative,\r\nand not a lecture on morality. His precepts on food and beverage are\r\ncircumstantial, after the manner of the ancients, and he recommends\r\nsuch a variety, that it is difficult to make a choice; while nothing\r\nbut the greatest simplicity can be of any avail. _Purifying fires_,\r\nwhich were kindled everywhere in times of plague, are also much\r\nlauded by him, and we here learn incidentally, that the smiths and\r\ncooks remained free[801] from the Sweating Sickness. Fumigations with\r\nodoriferous substances of all kinds, even the most costly Indian\r\nspices, were everywhere employed in the houses of the rich, and no one\r\nstirred out without having with him some one of the thousand scents\r\nrecommended from time immemorial during the plague. The medicines which\r\nhe recommends are those that were then in vogue; among which Theriaca,\r\nArmenian Bole, and Pearls, occur in various combinations, yet most of\r\nthe prophylactics which he advises for obviating any defect in the\r\nconstitution are not very violent.\r\n\r\nKaye’s treatment of the Sweating Sickness is according to the mild old\r\nEnglish plan, which is very judiciously and perspicuously laid down.\r\nHe kept himself, on the whole, free from the influence of the schools\r\nin this instance, and the only remedy which he approved in case of\r\nnecessity, was a harmless and very favourite preparation of pearls and\r\nodoriferous substances, which was called Manus Christi[802], or, in\r\nGermany, sugar of pearls. It had its origin in the fifteenth century,\r\nand was the invention of _Guainerus_[803], and there were various\r\nreceipts for compounding it[804]. He also sometimes prescribed, at\r\nthe commencement of the attack[805], bole or terra sigillata, for how\r\ncould a physician of the sixteenth century doubt the antipoisonous\r\neffect of this overrated remedy? Restlessness in the patient, debility,\r\na too thick skin, and thick blood, are set forth by him as the chief\r\nimpediments to the critical sweat, and in order to remove them, he\r\nsets to work with great and laudable caution, ordering, according to\r\ncircumstances, even mulled wine and greater warmth. Sometimes, too,\r\nhe could not refrain from employing Theriac and Mithridate, but he\r\ndid not use these remedies to any great extent. For dropsical and\r\nrheumatic patients who became the subjects of the Sweating Sickness,\r\nhe prescribed a beverage of Guaiacum; he also recommended as a\r\nsudorific, the China root, which was at that time much in use. When\r\nthe perspiration broke out, he positively prohibited the urging it\r\nbeyond the proper point; all medicines were thence laid aside, and he\r\ntrusted to aromatic vinegar and gentle succussion alone for keeping off\r\nthe lethargy, without considering, with _Damianus_, that more severe\r\nmeasures were essential[806].\r\n\r\nAs a learned patron of the sciences, Kaye ranks amongst the most\r\ndistinguished men of his country. Through his interest, Gonville Hall\r\nwas, in the reign of _Queen Mary_, elevated to the rank of a college,\r\nbetter established, and more richly endowed. To the end of his life,\r\nhe continued to preside[807] over this his favourite institution,\r\nand passed his old age[808] there, not in Monkish contemplation,\r\nlike Linacre, but zealously devoted to study, as the great number of\r\nhis writings testifies. He was accused of having changed his faith\r\naccording to circumstances. This pliability served, it is true,\r\nto retain him in favour with sovereigns of very opposite modes of\r\nthinking: it is not, however, a sign of elevation of mind, and can only\r\nbe explained in part by the spirit of the English Reformation. _Kaye_\r\nwas a reformer in fact, inasmuch as he was a promoter of instruction,\r\nand, perhaps, laid no stress on outward profession. His versatility\r\nas a scholar is extraordinary, and would be worthy of the highest\r\nadmiration, had he entirely avoided the reproach of credulity, had\r\nhe not been too prolix in subordinate matters, and had he shown more\r\ndecided signs of genius. At one time he translated and illustrated the\r\nwritings of Galen; at another, he wrote on philology or the medical\r\nart—it must be confessed, without much originality, for he took _Galen_\r\nand _Montanus_ as his patterns[809]. But where could physicians\r\nbe found at that time who did not follow established doctrines?\r\nSome essays on History and English Archæology are found among his\r\nwritings[810]; and his works on Natural History[811], dedicated to\r\nConrad Gesner, are among the best of his age, because he imparted\r\nhis observations in them quite plainly and naturally, free from the\r\ntrammels of any school. He died at Cambridge on the 29th of July, 1573,\r\nand ordered for himself the following epitaph-“Fui Caius.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                         SWEATING SICKNESSES.\r\n\r\n    Ἔστι γὰρ τὸ πάθος λύσις τῶν δεσμῶν τῆς εἰς ζωὴν δυνάμιος.\r\n\r\n                                                             ARETÆUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n             SECT. 1.—THE CARDIAC DISEASE OF THE ANCIENTS.\r\n\r\n                          (MORBUS CARDIACUS.)\r\n\r\nThus by the autumn of 1551, the Sweating Sickness had vanished from\r\nthe earth: it has never since appeared as it did then and at earlier\r\nperiods; and it is not to be supposed, that it will ever again\r\nbreak forth as a great epidemic in the same form, and limited to a\r\nfour-and-twenty hours’ course; for it is manifest, that the mode of\r\nliving of the people had a great share in its origin; and this will\r\nnever again be the same as in those days. Yet nature is not wanting\r\nin similar phenomena, which have appeared in ancient and modern\r\ntimes; and if we take into the account the great frequency of cognate\r\nrheumatic maladies, it is possible that isolated cases may have\r\nsometimes occurred, in which repletion of impure fluids, and violently\r\ninflammatory treatment have augmented a rheumatic fever, even to the\r\ndestruction of nervous vitality, by means of profuse perspiration—only,\r\nperhaps, that they ran a longer course, (which does not constitute\r\nan essential difference,) and under totally different names, whereby\r\nattention is misled. Of all the diseases that have ever appeared\r\nwhich can in any way be compared to the English Sweating Sickness, we\r\nhave principally three to look back upon—the _cardiac disease_ of the\r\nancients, the _Picardy sweat_, and the _sweating fever of Rötingen_.\r\nThe first was, for reasons which have been already mentioned[812],\r\nalmost unknown to the learned of the sixteenth century; and it is\r\nmatter of surprise, that Kaye himself, who had chosen for his favourite\r\nthe best Roman physician, we mean Celsus, could have so entirely\r\noverlooked his by no means unimportant statements respecting this\r\ndisease. _Houlier_ is the only author who ventures a comparison of the\r\nEnglish Sweating Sickness with the ancient cardiac disease; his few,\r\nand almost lost words[813], remained however unheeded; nor are the\r\ndifferences between the two diseases small: but to return.\r\n\r\nThe disease of which we are speaking appeared for a period of 500\r\nyears, (from 300 B.C. to 200 after Christ,) and was a common, almost\r\nevery day occurrence, which is often mentioned even by non-medical\r\nwriters. It was exceedingly dangerous, and even esteemed fatal; and\r\nas it was far above the reach of Greek physiology, there were not\r\nwanting extraordinary opinions respecting its nature, and bold and\r\nsingular modes of treatment, to which those who were attacked were\r\nsubjected. The name _Cardiac disease_ (morbus cardiacus, νόσος καρδιακὴ\r\nand probably also νόσος καρδίτις,) was not bestowed by medical men,\r\nbut by the people; who, in the fourth century before Christ, for the\r\nname is as ancient as that period, could not know that the learned\r\nwould dispute on that subject. Some affirmed, and among them men of\r\ngreat authority, such as _Erasistratus_, _Asclepiades_, and _Aretæus_,\r\nthat the people were in the right so to call the disease; that the\r\nheart was actually the part affected, and that their knowledge of the\r\nheart’s functions was by no means small[814]. Others, on the contrary,\r\nwould only acknowledge in that name an expression indicative, not\r\nof the particular seat of the disease, but only of its importance,\r\ninasmuch as the heart is well adapted, as the centre and source of\r\nlife, to indicate this[815]. Others again, who attempted more refined\r\nconjectures, wished to represent the pericardium as the seat of the\r\nmalady, because darting pains were sometimes felt[816] in the region\r\nof the heart, or the diaphragm, or the lungs, or even the liver. The\r\nopinions were numerous; the actual knowledge was small[817].\r\n\r\nThe cardiac disease began with rigors and a numbness in the\r\nlimbs[818], and sometimes even throughout the whole body. The\r\npulse then took on the worst condition, was small, weak, frequent,\r\nempty, and as if dissolving; in a more advanced stage, unequal and\r\nfluttering, until it became completely extinct. Patients were affected\r\nwith hallucinations[819]; they were sleepless, despaired of their\r\nrecovery, and were usually covered suddenly with an ill-savoured\r\nperspiration over the whole body, whence the disorder was likewise\r\ncalled _Diaphoresis_. Sometimes, however, a washy sweat broke out,\r\nfirst on the face and neck. This then spread itself over the whole\r\nbody; assumed a very disagreeable odour, became clammy and like water\r\nin which flesh had been macerated, and ran through the bed-clothes in\r\nstreams, so that the patient seemed to be melting away[820]. The breath\r\nwas short and panting almost to annihilation (insustentabilis). Those\r\naffected were in continual fear of suffocation[821]; tossed to and fro\r\nin the greatest anguish, and with _a very thin and trembling voice_\r\nuttered forth only broken words. They constantly felt an insufferable\r\noppression in the _left side_, or even over the whole chest[822]; and\r\nin the paroxysms which were ushered in with _a fainting fit_, or were\r\nfollowed by one, _the heart was tumultuous and palpitated_, without\r\nany alteration in the smallness of the pulse[823]. The countenance was\r\n_pale as death_, the eyes sunk in their sockets, and when the disease\r\ntook a fatal turn, all was darkness around them. _The hands and feet\r\nturned blue_; and whilst the heart, notwithstanding the universal\r\ncoldness of the body, still beat violently, they for the most part\r\nretained possession of their senses. A few only wandered a short\r\ntime before death, while others were even seized with convulsions\r\nand endowed with the power of prophecy[824]. _Finally, the nails\r\nbecame curved on their cold hands_, the skin was wrinkled, and thus\r\nthe sufferers resigned their spirit without any mitigation of their\r\nmiserable condition[825].\r\n\r\nA striking resemblance is plainly perceived, from this description,\r\nbetween the ancient cardiac disease and the English Sweating Sickness\r\nin the most exquisite cases of each. In both the same palpitation of\r\nthe heart, the same alteration of the voice, the same anxiety, the\r\nsame impediment to respiration, and thence the same affection of the\r\nnerves of the chest, the same ill-scented sweat, and, by means of\r\nthis sweat, the same fatal evacuation; in short, all the essential\r\nsymptoms arising from the same circle of functions. For in the sweating\r\npestilences of the ancients[826], as well as the moderns, the nerves of\r\nthe abdomen remained unaffected; the liver, intestines, and kidneys,\r\ntook no part in the primary affection; the diaphragm, as in the English\r\nSweating Sickness, formed the partition. Hence the acute _Aretæus_ did\r\nnot hesitate to call the cardiac disease _fainting_ (syncope), with\r\ncertainly an unusual extension of the notion implied by this term,\r\nwhich in its common acceptation excludes the turbulent commotion of the\r\nheart. In the affection of the brain some difference occurs, for though\r\nthe hallucination afforded an unfavourable prognostic in both diseases,\r\nyet the fatal stupor was peculiar to the English Sweating Sickness, no\r\nobserver having made mention of it in the cardiac disease.\r\n\r\nGreater and altogether essential differences between this affection\r\nand the English Sweating Sickness appear in another respect. There\r\nis every reason to suppose that the cardiac disease first appeared\r\nin the time of _Alexander_ the Great, that is to say, at the end of\r\nthe fourth century before Christ; for the Hippocratic physicians\r\nwere unacquainted with it, _Erasistratus_, who was body physician\r\nto Seleucus Nicator, and was a universally celebrated professor at\r\nAlexandria under the first Ptolemy, being the first to mention it. If\r\nthat age be compared even superficially with that of Henry the VIIth\r\nand Henry the VIIIth; and Africa, Asia Minor, and the South of Europe\r\nwith England, we shall easily be convinced that the two diseases,\r\nnotwithstanding the agreement in their main symptoms, could not be\r\nthe same; moreover, much was comprehended by the ancients under the\r\nname of morbus cardiacus, which, on a nearer examination, proves not\r\nto be one and the same definite form of morbid action: for sometimes\r\nthis affection is spoken of as an independent disease; sometimes it\r\nis mentioned only as a symptom superadded to others—as a kind of\r\ntransition from other very various diseases, such as has occurred in\r\nmodern times. _Soranus_ mentions, as such diseases, continued fevers,\r\naccompanied by much heat[827]; and reckons among them the “Causus,”\r\nthat is, an inflammatory bilious fever, to which _Aretæus_ also saw\r\nthe cardiac disease superadded. These fevers passed, on the fifth or\r\nsixth day, into the cardiac disease, and such a transition occurred\r\nchiefly on the critical days[828]. In a similar sense _Celsus_ speaks\r\neven of _Phrenitis_, under which name we are here to understand all\r\ninflammatory fevers accompanied by violent delirium, with the exception\r\nof actual inflammation of the brain. Thus we see that the cardiac\r\ndisease arose and increased on a very different soil from other\r\ndiseases, and was, to furnish an ancient example, as far from being\r\nindependent under these circumstances as _lethargy_ was in similar\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nBut there was doubtless an independent idiopathic form of the cardiac\r\ndisease. Whether this was febrile or not, the most celebrated\r\nphysicians of ancient times were not agreed. Now, how could they ever\r\nhave differed upon the subject, if the cardiac disease had always\r\nappeared only as a sequela on the fifth or sixth day of inflammatory\r\nfevers? _Apollophanes_, a disciple of Erasistratus, and physician to\r\n_Antiochus the First_, considered it, with his master, as constantly\r\nfebrile, and his opinion prevailed for a long time: perhaps he was\r\nin the right, for it is probable that in the first half of the third\r\ncentury, the disorder was much more violent than at a subsequent\r\nperiod. His celebrated contemporary, _Demetrius_ of Apamea, disciple\r\nof Herophilus, affirmed, that he had recognised fever only in the\r\nbeginning of the disease, and that it disappeared in its further\r\nprogress. Very soon, most physicians decided that it was not febrile,\r\nbut _Asclepiades_ distinguished a febrile and a non-febrile form of\r\nthe cardiac disease, and it is certain that this physician was a very\r\naccurate observer. _Themison_ and _Thessalus_ also agreed with him.\r\n_Aretæus_ described, in a cursory manner, the febrile form only, and\r\nperhaps was not acquainted with any other. _Soranus_ followed, in the\r\nessential points, _Asclepiades_, the founder of his school; and later\r\nwriters generally regarded the inward heat, the hot breath, and the\r\nburning thirst—symptoms which were occasionally less marked, as proofs\r\nof the febrile nature of the disease. Numerous theoretical views,\r\nbelonging to particular schools, of which we do not here treat, were\r\nintermingled with these, and upon the whole, that form seems to have\r\nbeen esteemed as non-febrile, in which the signs of feverish excitement\r\nappeared less marked. In all cases the cardiac disease set in with\r\nexternal coldness, and with a small contracted quick pulse, symptoms\r\nwhich with certainty indicate fever[829].\r\n\r\nRespecting the course of the cardiac disease, we are not furnished with\r\nsufficient information. It was no doubt very rapid, for the frame could\r\nnot long endure symptoms of so violent a kind, and the disorder must of\r\nnecessity soon have come to a crisis; yet from the ample directions for\r\ntreatment, we may conclude that it lasted at least some days. If the\r\nperspiration was well surmounted, patients seemed to recover rapidly,\r\nand their sufferings appeared to them, according to the expressions of\r\n_Aretæus_, like a dream, out of which they awoke to a consciousness of\r\nthe increased acumen of their senses[830]. But the termination was not\r\nalways so fortunate. The disease was very dangerous, and in many, after\r\nthe occurrence of an incomplete crisis, an insidious fever remained\r\nbehind, which ended in a consumption[831]. The whole phenomenon was\r\naltogether peculiar, and among existing diseases there are none which\r\nbear any comparison with it.\r\n\r\nThere must therefore have been something in the whole state of\r\nexistence among the ancients which favoured the formation of the\r\ncardiac disease. That it arose oftener in summer than in winter, that\r\nit attacked men more frequently than women, and especially young people\r\nfull of life, and hot-blooded plethoric persons, who used much bodily\r\nexercise, we learn from credible observers[832]. In this respect,\r\ntherefore, it bore a resemblance to the English Sweating Sickness. We\r\nmay also add, that indigestion, repletion, drunkenness, as likewise\r\ngrief and fear, but especially vomiting and the employment of the bath\r\nafter dinner, occasioned an attack of the malady[833]. Let us call to\r\nmind the habits of the ancients. It was in the time of _Alexander_ that\r\noriental luxury was first introduced. Gluttony became a part of the\r\nenjoyment of life, and warm baths a necessary refinement in sensuality,\r\nwhich just at this time were philosophically established by _Epicurus_;\r\nnor was this the last instance in which philosophers encouraged the\r\nerrors and infirmities of human society.\r\n\r\nHere, again, therefore, as in the English Sweating Sickness, we meet\r\nwith _the relaxed state of skin, and the foul repletion_ engendered by\r\nthe same indulgence in sensuality which we have found to exist in the\r\nsixteenth century. How this corruption of morals increased, and to what\r\na frightful height it was carried among the Romans, it is not necessary\r\nhere further to elucidate; and we may take it for a fact, that in\r\nconsequence of it, the general constitution of the ancients underwent a\r\npeculiar modification; that this relaxation of skin and gross repletion\r\nwere propagated from generation to generation; and that, as among\r\nchronic diseases, those of _a gouty character_ were its more frequent\r\nresults, so among the inflammatory, _the cardiac disease_ made its\r\nappearance as the general effect of this kind of life.\r\n\r\nWhere, however, such a system of life existed among whole communities,\r\nthe original and peculiar occasion was not needed in every individual\r\ncase to bring the predisposition for a disease which propagated itself\r\nby hereditary taint, to an actual eruption. Shocks to the constitution\r\nof quite a different kind were often sufficient for the purpose. Thus,\r\namong the Romans, it was by no means always the case, that gluttony\r\nand relaxation of the skin immediately gave rise to the cardiac\r\ndisease; while, on the other hand, the usual faintness, induced by too\r\ncopious blood-letting, passed into this impetuous agitation of the\r\nheart, accompanied by colliquative sweats[834]; and all overviolent\r\nperspirations in other diseases were apt to take the same dangerous\r\ncourse[835]. We must here also take into account a practice among the\r\nRomans, which was very injurious, and yet rendered sacred by the laws;\r\nnamely, visiting the public baths late in the evening, just after the\r\nprincipal meal, and awaiting the digestion of their food in these\r\nplaces of soft indulgence[836]. How much must the tendency of sweating\r\ndisorders have been favoured by these means!\r\n\r\nSurmises founded on the facts already stated, can alone be offered\r\nrespecting the nature of the ancient cardiac disease. The ancients\r\ngive us no certain intelligence upon it; for their mode of observing\r\ndid not lead to that object at which modern medicine aims. _That the\r\ncardiac disease was not of a rheumatic character_ seems deducible from\r\nseveral circumstances—from the quality of the atmosphere in southern\r\nclimates, which is not so favourable to rheumatic maladies, as to give\r\nrise to a distinctly defined form of that complaint throughout a period\r\nof five hundred years; from the nature of the so-called inflammatory\r\nfever, which exhibited no rheumatic symptoms in its course; and\r\nlastly, from the treatment of the cardiac disease, for it was a common\r\npractice to cool down the “diaphoretic” patients in the midst of their\r\nperspiration, by sponging them with cold water, to expose them to\r\nthe air, and some physicians went so far as to advise cold baths and\r\naffusions[837]. How could they have ventured upon such remedies if the\r\ncardiac disease had been of a rheumatic nature?\r\n\r\nIn the sweating fevers of the sixteenth century, every abrupt\r\nrefrigeration, every exposure of the skin, was fatal. It is thence to\r\nbe inferred, _that the English Sweating Sickness differed from the\r\nancient cardiac disease in its rheumatic character_; even although\r\nboth diseases were founded in common on an impure gross repletion and\r\nrelaxation of skin, and the essential phenomena of both went through\r\nthe same course: not to advert to other differences which are manifest\r\nfrom what has been stated.\r\n\r\nThe remaining treatment of the cardiac disorder should not be\r\naltogether passed over in this place, because it shews very clearly the\r\ngeneral style of thinking of the medical profession, as also certain\r\nmetaphysical excitations which are innate in that profession, and of\r\nwhich there is therefore a repetition in all ages. For whilst some\r\nproceeded with commendable care and caution, and _Aræteus_ feared[838]\r\na fatal result from the slightest error, others again, would fain\r\nrender excited nature obedient to their rough command by means of\r\nthe most violent remedies. It, therefore, occasionally happened that\r\nin their over hasty activity they were unable to distinguish between\r\na salutary perspiration and a dangerous “diaphoresis.” This they\r\nsuppressed at all hazards, and thus sent their patients to the shades\r\nof their fathers. Others forthwith flew to Chrysippic bandaging, the\r\ngreat means of suppressing profuse evacuations, and even violent\r\nspasms[839]. Others were for obviating the debility as quickly as\r\npossible by means of nourishing diet; and overloaded the stomach, as\r\nif the recovery of strength depended entirely upon eating. Others\r\nallowed as much wine as possible to be drunk for twenty-four hours\r\ntogether, even to the extent of producing intoxication[840]; and\r\n_Asclepiades_ selected for this extraordinary death-bed carousal the\r\nGreek salt wine[841], for the sake of bringing on a diarrhœa, whereby\r\nthe opened pores of the skin might again close, and the too mobile\r\natoms might be carried towards the bowels. With the same object he\r\nordered active clysters[842], for if they succeeded in causing a full\r\nevacuation, he maintained that the perspiration must necessarily be\r\narrested! _Endemus_, of the Methodic sect, recommended even clysters\r\nof cold water[843], and whatever else the rashness of medical men had\r\nfool-hardily contrived; acting on the ancient notion, that severe\r\ndiseases always required violent remedies. _Aretæus_ recommended\r\nblood-letting, which others pronounced to be nothing short of certain\r\ndeath[844]. He had, however, a notion that the Causus was the\r\nfoundation of the cardiac disease, and perhaps he was right.\r\n\r\nA cautious employment of wine was apparently of great use[845], and\r\nwhat may excite surprise, physicians gave detailed and frivolous\r\nprecepts on the choice and enjoyment of food. If the irritable stomach\r\nrejected this repeatedly, they even went so far, according to the\r\nRoman method, as to make the patient vomit both before and after his\r\nmeals, in order that the organ might thus bear the repeated use of\r\nnourishment. It was also asserted that the stomach retained food and\r\nwine better if the body were previously rubbed all over with bruised\r\nonions[846]. All this affords us an insight into the nature of this\r\nremarkable disease, which has now so completely vanished from the\r\nworld. Finally, when astringent decoctions proved fruitless, particular\r\nconfidence was placed in the application of various powders[847] to the\r\nsurface of the body, conjointly with the use of light bed-clothes and\r\nthe avoidance of feather-beds, which the effeminacy of the ancients\r\nhad already introduced[848]. As astringents they selected pomegranate\r\nbark, the leaves of roses, blackberries, and myrtles, as also fullers’\r\nearth, gypsum, alum, litharge, slaked lime[849], and, when nothing else\r\nwas at hand, even common road dust[850]! The efficacy of some of these\r\nextraordinary remedies cannot be denied. At least it has been proved in\r\nmodern times with respect to alkalies, which are of a somewhat similar\r\nnature, that they are of great service where there is an abundant\r\ndetermination of acid towards the skin, and it is very probable that\r\nthe perspiration of these diaphoretic patients contained much acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECT. 2.—THE PICARDY SWEAT.\r\n\r\n                 (SUETTE DES PICARDS—SUETTE MILIAIRE.)\r\n\r\nThe Picardy Sweat is a decided miliary fever, which has often\r\nprevailed, not only in Picardy, but also in other provinces of France,\r\nfor more than a hundred years, and even at the present time exists\r\nin some places as an endemic disease[851]. We have pointed out the\r\naffinity between the English Sweating Sickness and miliary fever. Both\r\nare rheumatic fevers—the former of twenty-four hours’ duration, the\r\nlatter running a course of at least seven days. In the former there was\r\nno eruption, or if in isolated cases an eruption made its appearance,\r\nit was doubtless subordinate, not essential. In the miliary fever, on\r\nthe contrary, the eruption is so essential, that this disease may be\r\nconsidered as a completely exanthematous form of rheumatic fever.\r\n\r\nThe history of miliary fever is full of important facts, and the\r\nsweating fever of Picardy forms but a variety of it. The eruption\r\nin itself is of very ancient occurrence, and was most probably, as\r\nat present, observed time immemorial in conjunction with petechiæ,\r\noccurring as a critical metastasis in the oriental glandular plague,\r\nperhaps even in the ancient plague recorded by Thucydides. It also\r\noccasionally accompanied petechial fever, as unquestionably it did\r\nsmall-pox and many other diseases, in the same manner as we now\r\nsee; for the miliary eruption is a very common symptom, which is\r\neasily induced, and increases the danger of various other accidental\r\ncomplications. This is different, however, from the _idiopathic miliary\r\nfever_, which did not exist either before, or even at the period of\r\nthe English Sweating Sickness, but occurred as an epidemic, frequently\r\nmentioned in Saxony, a hundred years later[852], (1652.)\r\n\r\nWe cannot, therefore, consider this eruptive disease as having\r\nproceeded from the English Sweating Sickness, in the same manner as\r\nthe petechial fever had its probable origin in the glandular plague,\r\neven supposing a more decided inclination of the Sweating Sickness\r\nto the eruptive character could be proved than is possible from the\r\nfacts afforded. A whole century intervened, and what vast national\r\nrevolutions!\r\n\r\nThis same separation of so long a period makes also against the\r\nsupposition, that the English Sweating Sickness was an interrupted\r\nmiliary fever, which exhausted its power by a too luxuriant activity\r\nof the skin on the first day, before the eruption made its appearance.\r\nMoreover, the similarity and isolation of all the five epidemic\r\nsweating fevers, as regards the brevity of the course of the disease,\r\nand the absence of all transition forms of any duration, which\r\ncertainly would have existed had nature intended gradually to form a\r\nmiliary fever out of the English Sweating Sickness, lead to the same\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the miliary fever. Some forms of this disease have\r\nbeen observed, in which a profuse perspiration, in combination with\r\nnervous symptoms, has endangered life on the first day of the attack;\r\nequally often, too, the eruption has appeared fully formed on the\r\nvery first day; and if we duly consider, as we ought, the regular\r\ncourse of miliary fever whenever it has assumed an epidemic character,\r\nwe shall always find, even in that case, a development of symptoms\r\ndiffering fundamentally from those of the English Sweating Sickness.\r\nIf, occasionally, instances of miliary fever occurred, in which no\r\neruption came out, as was the case recently (in 1821), they were to\r\nbe considered in the same light as other acute eruptive diseases,\r\nas, for example, scarlet fever, in which nature indulges in a like\r\nirregularity, without, however, altering the essence of those diseases.\r\nAnd since, finally, it has been observed in many cases[853], that\r\nthe miliary eruption could be prevented by the application of cold\r\nat the commencement, a distinguished modern physician has attached\r\ngreat consequence to this circumstance, as showing that miliary fever\r\nand the English Sweating Sickness were the same disease[854]; but a\r\ncheck of this kind is, at all events, impossible in those miliary\r\nfevers where the eruption breaks forth on the first or second day; and\r\nmoreover, experience tells us, that many other diseases also, such as\r\ninflammations, rheumatisms, gastric fevers, and even abdominal typhus,\r\nmay be arrested in their course, and confined within narrower bounds,\r\nso as not to manifest all their symptoms.\r\n\r\nWe are, therefore, completely entitled to consider the appearance of\r\nthe miliary sweating fevers as altogether a novelty, originating in\r\nthe middle of the 17th century, and having no discoverable connexion\r\nwith the English Sweating Sickness. There have been in Germany, since\r\nthe year 1652, many visitations of miliary fever; but this disease did\r\nnot increase much in extent until about the year 1715, when it spread\r\ninto France and the neighbouring countries, particularly Piedmont[855],\r\nwhilst England remained almost entirely free from it. The French\r\nepidemics were, upon the whole, much more severe than the German; and\r\non this account we select one of the most ancient, and also the most\r\nrecent of them, in order to give a general view of miliary fever, as\r\ncompared with the English Sweating Sickness.\r\n\r\nThe miliary fever first appeared in Picardy, in the year 1718, in le\r\nVimeux (Vinnemacus pagus), a district on the north of the Somme and\r\non the south of the Bresle and the department of the Lower Seine. It\r\nincreased annually in extent; most places in Picardy were visited by\r\nit, and it was not long before it was seen in Flanders[856].\r\n\r\nWe are still in possession of a very distinct account, which we will\r\nhere detail, of an epidemic at Abbeville in the year 1733, where the\r\nmiliary fever had existed fifteen years previously. There were scarcely\r\nany premonitory symptoms, but the disease commenced at once with\r\npinching pains in the stomach, extreme prostration of strength, dull\r\nheadache, and difficulty of breathing, interrupted by sighing. Patients\r\ncomplained of violent heat, and were bathed in a pungent sweat of foul\r\nodour, while nausea was occasionally felt. Sparks appeared before the\r\neyes, and _the countenance became flushed_. Patients were tormented\r\nwith burning thirst; and yet the tongue was as moist as in perfect\r\nhealth. The pulse was frequent and undulating, without hardness; and\r\nin the course of _a few hours_, an insufferable itching came on over\r\nthe whole body, accompanied by distressing jactitation: upon this,\r\nthickly studded, _red, round pustules_, not bigger than mustard-seeds,\r\nbroke out, wherefrom patients emitted an extremely disagreeable urinous\r\nodour, which was imparted to those who were about their persons.\r\nSometimes they had evacuations, at other times they suffered from\r\nconstipation, but all complained of want of sleep; and when they felt\r\nan inclination to doze, they were again aroused by fresh chilliness.\r\nMany bled at the nose till they fainted; and with women, the menstrual\r\ndischarge often appeared, though not at the proper time. The urine was\r\nat times deficient in quantity, at others discharged in abundance,\r\nand without any critical signs; if pale and plentiful, it betokened\r\ndelirium; then the eyelids twitched convulsively, a humming noise\r\ncommenced in the ears, and the patient tossed about restlessly. The\r\npulse became strong, irregular, and, like the breathing, very quick.\r\nThe countenance grew redder and redder; and soon after, the sufferers,\r\nas though struck by lightning, were seized with lethargy, and expired,\r\ngenerally in the act of coughing and spitting blood.\r\n\r\nSuch was the nature of the disease when it attacked many at once: there\r\nwere, however, several varieties. With some the miliary vesicles broke\r\nout on the _second_ day, with others not before the _third_; and if\r\nall went on favourably, they lost their redness on the _seventh day_,\r\nand _the skin all over the body scaled off like bran_. The fever was\r\nsometimes extremely violent; at others, without apparent cause, very\r\nmild; at least one might be deceived at the commencement of the attack,\r\nby the apparently favourable symptoms; for those who in the morning\r\nhad scarcely any notable degree of fever, who neither suffered from\r\nany anxious sensation nor violent heat, in whom no subsultus tendinum\r\nwas perceptible, no want of perspiration, nor any retrocession of the\r\neruption, were sometimes towards evening seized with phrenzy, and died\r\nin a state of lethargy. Evacuations, which alleviate other diseases,\r\nmade this miliary fever worse. Favourable symptoms could never be\r\ndepended on. In the midst of profuse perspiration the patient died,\r\neither from constipation or diarrhœa. A copious discharge of urine\r\nwas a bad sign; composure was succeeded by delirium, cheerfulness by\r\nlethargy: the disease was throughout treacherous and disguised. It\r\nwas particularly necessary for those suffering from pleurisy or any\r\ninflammatory fevers to be guarded against its approach. Many fell\r\nsacrifices to this epidemic who thought themselves in a state of\r\nconvalescence; and with such it was easier to foretell than to prevent\r\nthe consequences. In cases of this kind the miliary vesicles were less\r\nred and grew pale sooner; but if the disease attacked a healthy person,\r\nthen they were redder, and continued longer. Of those who recovered,\r\nnot a few suffered for many months, nay, even for a whole year, from\r\nnight perspirations, without fever or sleeplessness, but with an\r\neruption of little miliary vesicles, which disappeared[857] again on\r\nthe slightest exposure to cold. The later miliary epidemic fevers in\r\nFrance, which are distinguished by the name of the Picardy Sweating\r\nSickness, are generally very well described[858]; so much so, that we\r\nhave few epidemics of modern times whose course and succession we can\r\ntrace so well. But the epidemic of 1821, which raged in the departments\r\nof the Oise, and of the Seine and Oise, from March to October, has been\r\nobserved by all with the greatest care, including men of distinguished\r\ntalent[859].\r\n\r\nWe shall give the description of this disease. There were no constant\r\npremonitory symptoms; it often broke out quite suddenly, but many\r\ncomplained some days before of debility, despondency, want of appetite,\r\nnausea, headache; sometimes also of giddiness and slight chilliness.\r\nMany retired to rest in health, and awoke during the night with the\r\ndisease, covered with a perspiration, which ceased only with death or\r\nrecovery. With some the sweating was preceded for some hours, or even\r\nonly for some moments, by a scarcely perceptible feverish commotion,\r\naccompanied with burning heat, or with a _sensation of pain_ which ran\r\nthrough every limb, and nearly always with spasms in the stomach. With\r\nothers the disease announced itself by lacerating rheumatic pains,\r\nwhich gradually increasing, they became bed-ridden. The mouth was\r\nfoul, the taste at times bitter, the tongue white, more rarely tinged\r\nwith yellow, and thus it remained till the patient was restored. The\r\nsufferer was shortly covered with _a thick, peculiarly fetid sweat_,\r\nthat certainly produced alleviation, but became very intolerable to\r\nhim from its unpleasant stench, which was even communicated to the\r\nclothes of the bystanders. In the mean time it was discovered by the\r\npulse, that the fever had considerably abated; but, on the third day,\r\nthe patient was seized with convulsive _spasms in the stomach_, great\r\n_oppression at the chest_, and a sensation of suffocation—symptoms\r\nwhich caused him insupportable anguish. These attacks accompanied by\r\nhiccup and eructation, continued for several hours, and returned from\r\ntime to time, an eruption, partly papular, simultaneously breaking out\r\nfirst on the neck, then on the shoulders down to the hands and breast,\r\nless frequently on the thighs and face. The little pimples were of a\r\npale red colour and conical, with glistening heads, and between them\r\nappeared innumerable small miliary pustules, filled with transparent\r\nserous fluid, which soon thickened and assumed a whiter hue. At the\r\ntime and previous to the breaking out of the exanthem, the patient\r\nexperienced a very severe _burning and pricking sensation in the skin_,\r\nwhich nevertheless sometimes occurred on the second or fourth day, and\r\nwhich increased sometimes in one part, sometimes in another, when the\r\nsweating declined.\r\n\r\nTowards the fifth day, however, after the sweating had entirely ceased,\r\nthe complaint grew worse again. The spasms and paroxysms of suffocation\r\nreturned, and they were succeeded by renewed eruptions of the exanthem;\r\na decided improvement, however, shortly took place; the little pimples\r\nlost their redness, the miliary vesicles dried away, and at a period\r\nfrom the seventh to the tenth day recovery commenced under _a general\r\nexfoliation of the cuticle_. Sometimes the eruption did not appear,\r\nwhether the patients were under medical treatment, or left to their own\r\nguidance, but with those few in whom there was an absence of miliary\r\nvesicles, that peculiar pricking and itching of the skin did not take\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nBetween the fifth and seventh day the patients usually complained of\r\ngreat weakness, and had a desire to eat. A few tablespoonfuls of wine\r\nthen agreed with them very well; for the rest, neither thirst nor\r\nlethargy was observable, but it was particularly remarkable that the\r\nurine was clear and abundant. Up to the seventh day a confined state\r\nof bowels was usual, and, with the exception of the already mentioned\r\nattacks of tightness and oppression, the breathing remained free,\r\nthough with great sleeplessness, during the whole malady. Nothing\r\nmorbid was to be observed in the chest, and the patients lay stretched\r\nout at full length, so that there was no occasion at any time to raise\r\ntheir heads.\r\n\r\nSuch was the regular course of this miliary fever, but its progress\r\nwas often accelerated by very dangerous symptoms, and occasionally it\r\nproved fatal within a very few hours. If at the time of the attack the\r\npatients were very restless and talkative, the eyes glistening, the\r\npulse, without being hard, tumultuous, and the edges of the tongue\r\nreddened, delirium soon succeeded and then convulsions and death.\r\nGreat depression of the spirits was a very bad symptom; bleeding was\r\nnever of any avail, yet the menstrual discharge did not interrupt\r\nthe course of the disease. There was in general a great degree of\r\nmalignancy perceptible in the malady, as was also rendered apparent\r\nby the course of the epidemic. If the miliary Sweating Fever broke out\r\nin a fresh place, two or three persons only were thereupon attacked,\r\nand that favourably, which led to a supposition that the evil had all\r\npassed away, for during the next fifteen or twenty days, not any fresh\r\nattacks were heard of. Suddenly, however, the epidemic reappeared\r\nwith increased virulence. The great number of the sufferers spread\r\nconsternation and terror amongst the inhabitants, and the cases of\r\ndeath became frequent. After this first burst of fury, the epidemic\r\ngrew more mild again, so that many patients were not confined to\r\ntheir beds at all. This mitigation of the miliary fever was likewise\r\nmanifested[860] by the prolongation of its course beyond the seventh\r\nday.\r\n\r\nIf we compare this epidemic with the one observed at Abbeville in 1773,\r\nwe shall find between them but very trifling differences, which would\r\nappear still more clearly in some of the intermediate visitations,\r\nthus conforming to what has been observed in other eruptive maladies.\r\nIt is consequently evident that the miliary fevers[861] which have\r\nappeared in France in recent times, do not differ in any essential\r\npoint from those of more ancient date. The surest proof of their\r\nidentity is, their persistence for nearly two centuries; and from the\r\nmanner in which they have presented themselves to observation, they\r\nare to be considered as distinct from the English Sweating Sickness,\r\nthough certainly allied to it. It would exceed our limits to pursue\r\nthis inquiry further, but it may be as well to give the following short\r\ncatalogue[862] of the most important miliary epidemics.\r\n\r\n  1652.

Up to the present time, its real importance has not been\r\nrecognised, because the clouds of self-sufficient ignorance have\r\nprevented our taking a survey of the formation of diseases, throughout\r\nlong periods of time. It has been sunk for an age in the sea of\r\noblivion, from whence we will now draw it forth to the light of day.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1802, a very hot and dry summer had been succeeded by\r\nincessant rain. Thick fogs spread over the country, and enveloped such\r\nplaces in central Germany as were inaccessible to ventilation. Amongst\r\nothers, the small Franconian town of Roettingen, situated on the river\r\nTauber, and surrounded by mountains[863]. Scarcely had a few weeks\r\nelapsed, when unexpectedly, towards the 25th of November, an extremely\r\nfatal disease broke out in the town, which was without example in the\r\nmemory of its inhabitants, and totally unknown to the physicians of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nStrong vigorous young men were suddenly seized with _unspeakable\r\ndread_; the heart became _agitated_ and _beat violently against_ the\r\nribs, a _profuse, sour, ill-smelling perspiration_ broke out over\r\nthe whole body, and at the same time, they experienced a _lacerating\r\npain_ in the nape of the neck, as if a violent rheumatic fever had\r\ntaken possession of the tendinous tissues. This pain ceased sometimes\r\nvery quickly, and if it then shifted to the chest, the distressing\r\npalpitation of the heart recommenced; a spasmodic trembling of the\r\nwhole body ensued; the sufferers fainted, their limbs became rigid,\r\nand thus they breathed their last. _In most cases, all this occurred\r\nwithin four and twenty hours._ They did not all, however, succumb under\r\nthe first attack, but as soon as the accelerated pulse had sunk to the\r\nlowest ebb of smallness and feebleness, a corresponding effect being\r\nobservable in the respiration, the violent pain would in some cases\r\nreturn to the outward parts. The patient then felt a benumbing pressure\r\nand stiffness in the nape of the neck; and the pulse and respiration\r\nbecame restored again as in health, but the perspiration continued to\r\npour incessantly down the skin.\r\n\r\nThis apparent safety was, however, very deceptive, for a renewed\r\npalpitation of the heart unexpectedly commenced, accompanied by a\r\nfeeble pulse; and then death was often inevitable. It was remarkable,\r\nthat the patients, though bathed in perspiration, had very little\r\nthirst, and the tongue was not dry, nor ever even foul, but retained\r\nits natural moisture. With most, however, the urine was scanty; as\r\nthe skin, under the increasing debility, permitted too much fluid to\r\nstream forth through its pores. _If the disease passed off without\r\nheating sudorifics, then in general no eruption made its appearance._\r\nThe malady then continued till the sixth day, but on the first only,\r\ndid it display its malignant symptoms, for by the second, the sweating\r\ndiminished and lost every unfavourable quality, so that increased\r\ntranspiration of the skin, without any other symptoms of importance,\r\nalone remained, and on the sixth day the patient was perfectly\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nHad there been in Roettingen a physician at hand from the commencement,\r\n_well skilled in medical history_, and who would have adopted the old\r\nEnglish treatment of the Sweating Sickness, this new fever would have\r\nappeared but as a perfectly mild disease, and would certainly have\r\ncarried off but few of the inhabitants of this peaceful little town.\r\nAs it was, however, the scenes of Lübeck and Zwickau were renewed,\r\nand it seemed as if the innumerable victims to the hot treatment, and\r\nto _Kegeler’s_ truculent medical work, had descended to the grave in\r\nvain. _The sufferers were, as in the sixteenth century, literally\r\nstewed to death!_ for the moment the people imagined that they knew\r\nhow nature meant to escape, they ordered feather-beds to be heaped\r\non the perspiring patient, so that the mouth and nose alone remained\r\nuncovered. Doors and windows were tightly closed, and the stove emitted\r\na glowing heat, whilst a most intolerable odour of perspiration\r\nstreamed forth from beneath the broad and lofty beds; added to which,\r\nthat two and even more patients were often lying in the same room;\r\nnay, even stowed together under the same mountain of feathers, and in\r\norder that inward heat might not be wanting, pots of theriaca were\r\nswallowed, and the patient was incessantly plied with elder electuary.\r\nThus the bad humours were expelled together with the perspiration;\r\nand whether the sufferers were suffocated, or surmounted, as by a\r\nmiracle, this mal-treatment of nature, a conviction was felt, that the\r\nmost salutary remedies had been employed, and when at last, eruptions\r\nof various colours broke out, it was considered as certain, that the\r\npoison had been carried off in them. The citizens of Roettingen,\r\ntherefore, fell into the same erroneous opinion, which, upheld by\r\nmedical schools, had, time immemorial, increased inflammatory diseases,\r\nparticularly the exanthematous, and caused them to become malignant.\r\nThe above-mentioned eruptions were of various sorts; miliary vesicles\r\nof every form and colour, filled with an acrid fluid; actual blistery\r\neruptions, (pemphigus,) and even petechiæ; and it is to be observed,\r\nthat the patients, during the first days of the sweating fever, never\r\nsuffered from that peculiar pricking sensation over the whole body,\r\nwhich precedes the eruption of miliaria, but complained only, and that\r\nnot always, of a local itching, where the eruption had broken out. It\r\nwas equally rare to observe a regular desquamation of the skin, and it\r\nis therefore to be assumed, that _the eruptions were only symptomatic_,\r\nand not by any means necessarily connected with the disease, as in the\r\ndecidedly miliary fevers.\r\n\r\nThe disease excited, from its very commencement, the greatest\r\nconsternation; and as it was increased, even from the first days of\r\nits appearance, by the sudorific system of treatment, deaths were\r\nmultiplied; the continual peal of funeral bells struck mortal terror,\r\nas of old at Shrewsbury, into the hearts of both sick and healthy; and\r\nthis oppressed little town was shunned as a pesthole by the inhabitants\r\nof the surrounding neighbourhood. At the commencement of the disease,\r\nthey were entirely without medical advice, till a skilful physician\r\narrived from the vicinity[864], and as _most of the inhabitants_ were\r\nalready attacked with the sweating fever, he immediately prescribed\r\nthe proper treatment. But the powers of one man are not sufficient,\r\namid such confusion, to contend with the deeply rooted prejudices of\r\nthe people, and so they continued in most houses to expel by heat and\r\ntheriaca both perspiration and life together; till at last, on the\r\nthird of December, _Dr. Sinner_ of Würzburg arrived, without whom the\r\nremembrance of this remarkable disease would have been obliterated, and\r\nconjointly with his gallant colleague, like the anonymous physician\r\nformerly in Zwickau, subdued the destructive prejudices of the people.\r\nHe found eighty-four patients[865] under piles of feather-beds, who,\r\nwhen pure air was admitted, breathed once more freely, and by a prudent\r\ncooling system, all recovered easily, and without danger, one only\r\nexcepted. His method reminds us of the old English treatment[866].\r\nThe disease was confined entirely to Roettingen, it did not make its\r\nappearance anywhere beyond the gates of this little town. On the fifth\r\nof December, however, clear, frosty weather set in; from that time no\r\nnew cases occurred, and all traces of this Roettingen sweating fever,\r\nwhich was never either preceded or followed by miliary fever in any\r\npart of Franconia, have from that time disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance of this fever to the English Sweating Sickness is\r\nmanifest, and is proved even by the short (_only ten days’_) duration\r\nof the visitation, which, as we have stated, is a most essential\r\ncharacteristic of the English sweating epidemic, at least as it\r\nappeared in Germany, the miliary epidemics always having lasted a much\r\nlonger period. But if we confine ourselves merely to the symptoms of\r\nthe disease, we shall find, that in the Roettingen sweating fever,\r\nthere are, throughout, none that can be considered essential, except\r\nthe _palpitation of the heart, accompanied with anguish_, the _profuse\r\nperspiration_, and the _rheumatic pains in the nape of the neck_,\r\nwhich never were wanting in any case; and the very same symptoms are\r\nclearly and perceptibly to be discerned in like proportion as compared\r\nwith others, in the representation of the English Sweating Sickness;\r\nwhereas, the eruptions were altogether as unessential as in the\r\nepidemic of the sixteenth century. The irritability of the skin, and\r\ntendency to dangerous metastases, were less marked in the Roettingen\r\nfever than in the English Sweating Sickness; for the patients could,\r\nwithout injury, change their linen in the midst of the perspiration,\r\nwhich, in the English Sweating Sickness, could not have been done\r\nwithout fatal consequences; but this difference can easily be accounted\r\nfor, from the greater degree of suffering in the latter disease than in\r\nthe former. It only now remains to examine the duration of the disease,\r\nand here we plainly perceive that the principal paroxysm was over in\r\nthe Roettingen epidemic within the first four and twenty hours, at\r\nleast when it was undisturbed by treatment; and the sole symptom which\r\ncontinued until the sixth day—the increased perspiration, (we speak\r\nhere only of perfectly pure cases,) could only reasonably be regarded\r\nas a sequela. The crisis did not occur all on a sudden, as in the\r\nEnglish Sweating Sickness, but this cannot constitute any essential\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nWe do not hesitate, therefore, to pronounce _the Roettingen fever to\r\nhave been the same disease as the English Sweating Sickness_. To give,\r\nhowever, this phenomenon its proper interpretation—to have a clear\r\nconception of the causes which again drew down from the clouds, into\r\nthe midst of Germany, this mist-born spectre of 1529, and allowed it\r\nto expend its brief fury upon a single place, is beyond the power\r\nof human wisdom. Science is not comprehensive enough to discover, in\r\nthe crossings of these unknown comet-paths, the moving causes of this\r\nvisitation of disease. But as all insight into the works of nature must\r\nbe preceded by a strict investigation and search after phenomena in all\r\ncountries, at all times, and under all circumstances of development, so\r\nan improved knowledge of diseases and of the whole human system, will\r\nnot fail to follow, when the investigations of epidemics throughout\r\nextensive periods have increased in number and success.\r\n\r\n_The present age demands such a knowledge of medical men, whose\r\nvocation it is to investigate life minutely in all its bearings. It\r\ndemands of them an historical pathology, and to this branch of the\r\nstudy of nature is the present work intended to contribute._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CHRONOLOGICAL SURVEY.\r\n\r\n        POLITICAL EVENTS.

At whose requeste, at that tyme I wrate diuerse counseiles so\r\nshortly as I could for the present necessite, whiche they bothe vsed\r\nand dyd geue abrode to many others, & further appoynted in my self to\r\nfulfill (for so much as laye in me) the other parte of their honest\r\nrequest for the time to come. The whiche the better to execute and\r\nbrynge to passe, I spared not to go to all those that sente for me,\r\nbothe poore, and riche, day and night. And that not only to do thē that\r\nease that I could, & to instructe thē for their recouery: but to note\r\nalso throughly, the cases and circumstaunces of the disease in diuerse\r\npersons, and to vnderstande the nature and causes of the same fully,\r\nfor so much as might be. Therefore as I noted, so I wrate as laisure\r\nthen serued, and finished one boke in Englishe, onely for Englishe mē\r\nnot lerned, one other in latine for men of lerninge more at large, and\r\ngenerally for the help of thē which hereafter should haue nede, either\r\nin this or other coūtreis, that they may lerne by our harmes. This I\r\nhad thoughte to haue set furth before christmas, & to haue geuē to your\r\nlordshippe at new-yeres tide, but that diuerse other businesses letted\r\nme. Neuertheles that which then coulde not be done cometh not now out\r\n     of season, although it be neuer so simple, so it may do ease\r\n        hereafter, which as I trust this shal, so for good wil\r\n           I geue and dedicate it vnto your good Lordshippe,\r\n            trustyng the same will take this with as good a\r\n               mind, as I geue it to your honour, whiche\r\n                  our Lorde preserue and graunt long\r\n                             to continue.\r\n\r\n                    At London the first of Aprill.\r\n\r\n                                 1552.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  THE\r\n                          BOKE OF JHON CAIUS\r\n                     AGAINST THE SWEATYNG SICKNES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMan beyng borne not for his owne vse and cōmoditie alone, but also\r\nfor the commō benefite of many, (as reason wil and al good authoures\r\nwrite) he whiche in this world is worthy to lyue, ought al wayes to\r\nhaue his hole minde and intente geuen to profite others. Whiche thynge\r\nto shewe in effecte in my selfe, although by fortune some waies I haue\r\nben letted, yet by that whiche fortune cannot debarre some waies again\r\nI haue declared. For after certein yeres beyng at cambrige, I of the\r\nage of xx. yeres, partly for mine exercise and profe what I coulde do,\r\nbut chefely for certein of my very frēdes, dyd translate out of Latine\r\ninto Englishe certein workes, hauyng nothynge els so good to gratifie\r\ntheim w^t. Wherof one of _S. Chrysostome de modo orandi deum_, that\r\nis, of y^e manner to praye to god, I sent to one my frende then beyng\r\nin the courte. One other, a woorke of _Erasmus de vera theologia_,\r\nthe true and redy waye to reade the scripture, I dyd geue to Maister\r\nAugustine Stiwarde Alderman of Norwiche, not in the ful as the authore\r\nmade it, but abbreuiate for his only purpose to whome I sent it, Leuyng\r\nout many subtile thinges, made rather for great & learned diuines, thē\r\nfor others. The thirde was the paraphrase of the same Erasmus vpon the\r\nEpistle of S. Jude, whiche I translated at the requeste of one other my\r\ndeare frende.\r\n\r\nThese I did in Englishe the rather because at that tyme men ware not\r\nso geuen all to Englishe, but that they dyd fauoure & maȳteine good\r\nlearning conteined in tongues & sciences, and did also study and apply\r\ndiligently the same thē selues. Therfore I thought no hurte done. Sence\r\ny^t tyme diuerse other thynges I haue written, but with entente neuer\r\nmore to write in the Englishe tongue, partly because the cōmoditie of\r\nthat which is so written, passeth not the compasse of Englande, but\r\nremaineth enclosed within the seas, and partly because I thought that\r\nlabours so taken should be halfe loste among them whiche sette not by\r\nlearnyng. Thirdly for that I thought it beste to auoide the iudgement\r\nof the multitude, from whome in maters of learnyng a man shalbe forced\r\nto dissente, in disprouyng that whiche they most approue, & approuyng\r\nthat whiche they moste disalowe. Fourthly for that the common settyng\r\nfurthe and printīg of euery foolishe thyng in englishe, both of\r\nphisicke vnperfectly, and other matters vndiscretly diminishe the grace\r\nof thynges learned set furth in thesame. But chiefely, because I wolde\r\ngeue none example or comforte to my countrie men, (whō I wolde to be\r\nnow, as here tofore they haue bene, comparable in learnyng to men of\r\nother countries) to stonde onely in the Englishe tongue, but to leaue\r\nthe simplicite of thesame, and to procede further in many and diuerse\r\nknoweleges bothe in tongues and sciences at home and in vniuersities,\r\nto the adournyng of the cōmon welthe, better seruice of their kyng, &\r\ngreat pleasure and commodite of their owne selues, to what kinde of\r\nlife so euer they shold applie them. Therfore whatsoeuer sence that\r\ntyme I minded to write, I wrate y^e same either in greke or latine.\r\nAs firste of all certein commentaries vpon certein bokes of William\r\nframinghā, maister of art in Cambrige, a man of great witte, memorie,\r\ndiligence and learnyng, brought vp in thesame scholes in Englande that\r\nI was, euer frō his beginnyng vntil his death. Of the which bokes,\r\nij. of _cōtinētia_ (or cōtinence) wer in prose, y^e reste in metre\r\nor verse of diuerse kindes. One a comforte for a blinde mā, entitled\r\n_ad Aemilianum cæcum consolatio_, one other _Ecpyrosis, seu incendiū\r\nsodomorū_, the burnyng of Sodome. The thirde _Laurentius_, expressyng\r\nthe tormentes of Saincte Laurence. The fourthe, _Idololatria_,\r\nIdolatrie, not after the trade and veine of scripture (wherein he\r\nwas also very well exercised) but conformable to scripture and after\r\nthe ciuile and humane learnyng, declaryng them to worshippe _Mars_,\r\nthat warre, or fight: _Venus_, that lyue incontinently: _Pluto_, that\r\nfolowe riches couetousely; and so forth through all vices vsed in his\r\ntime. The fineth boke _Arete_, vertue: the sixth, Epigrāmes, conteined\r\nin two bokes, whiche by an epistle of his owne hand before y^e boke\r\nyet remainyng, he dedicated vnto me, purposyng to haue done many more\r\nprety thynges, but that cruell death preuēted, and toke him away wher\r\nhe and I was borne at Norwiche, in the yere of our Lord M.d.xxxvij.\r\nthe xxix. daie of September, beynge then of the age of xxv. yeres,\r\nvij. Monethes, and vj. daies, a greate losse of so notable a yonge\r\nman. These workes at his death he willed to comme to my handes, by\r\nwhich occasion after I had viewed thē, and perceiued them ful of al\r\nkyndes of learnyng, thinkyng thē no workes for all mē to vnderstande\r\nwith out helpe, but such as were wel sene in all sortes of authours: I\r\nendeuoured my selfe partely for the helpe of others, & partly for mine\r\nowne exercise, to declare vpon theim the profite of my studie in ciuile\r\nand humane learnynge, and to haue before mine eyes as in a worke (which\r\nwas alwaies my delyght) how muche I had profited in the same. Thys so\r\ndone, I ioyned euery of my commentaries to euery of hys saied bokes,\r\nfaier written by Nicolas Pergate puple to the saied Maister Framyngham,\r\nmyndyng after the iudgement of learned men had in thesame, to haue set\r\ntheim furthe in prynte, if it had ben so thought good to theim. For\r\nwhyche cause, at my departynge into Italie, I put an Epistle before\r\ntheym dedicatorye to the right Reuerend father in God Thomas Thirlbye,\r\nnow Bishoppe of Norwiche, because thesame maister Framyngham loued\r\nhym aboue others. He after my departure deliuered the bokes to the\r\nreuerende father in god Jhō Skippe, late bishop of Hereforde, then to\r\nD. Thirtle, tutor to the sayd maister framynhā, frō him to syr Richard\r\nMorisine, now ambassadoure for y^e kinges maiestie with thēperour, then\r\nto D. Tailour Deane of Lincolne, and syr Thomas Smithe, secretarie\r\nafter to y^e kynges Maiestie, all great learned men. Frō these to\r\nothers they wente, among whome the bokes died, (as I suppose,) or els\r\nbe closely kept, that after my death they may be setfurthe in the names\r\nof them which now haue thē, as their workes. Howe soeuer it be, wel I\r\nknowe that at my returne out of Italie (after vj. yeres continuance\r\nther) into Englād, I coulde neuer vnderstand wher they wer, although I\r\nbothe diligently and desirousely sought thē. After these I translated\r\nout of Greke into Latine a litle boke of _Nicephorus_, declarynge howe\r\na man maye in praiynge confesse hym selfe, which after I dyd geue\r\nvnto Jhō Grome bacheler in arte, a yong man in yeres, but in witte\r\n& learnyng for his tyme, of great expectatiō. That done I beganne a\r\nchronicle of the citie of Norwiche, of the beginninge therof & thinges\r\ndone ther frō time to time. The matere wherof yet rude and vndigested\r\nlyeth by me, which at laisure I minde to polishe, and to make an\r\nend of that I haue begunne. And to be shorte, in phisicke diuerse\r\nthynges I haue made & settefurth in print bothe in Greke and Latine,\r\nnot mindyng to do other wise, as I haue before said, al my life: For\r\nwhich cause al these thinges I haue rehersed, els superfluous in this\r\nplace. Yet see, meaning now to counseill a litle agaynst the sweatyng\r\nsickenes for helpe also of others, notwithstandyng my former purpose,\r\ntwo thynges compell me, in writynge therof, to returne agayne to\r\nEnglishe, Necessite of the matter, & good wyl to my countrie, frendes,\r\n& acquaintance, whiche here to haue required me, to whome I thinke my\r\nselfe borne.\r\n\r\nNecessite, for that this disease is almoste peculiar vnto vs Englishe\r\nmen, and not common to all men, folowyng vs, as the shadowe the body,\r\nin all countries, albeit not at al times. Therfore compelled I am to\r\nvse this our Englishe tongue as best to be vnderstande, and moste\r\nnedeful to whome it most foloweth, most behoueth to haue spedy remedie,\r\nand often tymes leaste nyghe to places of succource and comforte at\r\nlerned mennes handes: and leaste nedefull to be setfurthe in other\r\ntongues to be vnderstand generally of all persons, whome it either\r\nhaunteth not at all, or els very seldome, as ones in an age. Thinkynge\r\nit also better to write this in Englishe after mine own meanyng,\r\nthen to haue it translated out of my Latine by other after their\r\nmisunderstandyng.\r\n\r\nGood wyll to my countrie frendes and acquaintance, seynge them wyth\r\nout defence yelde vnto it, and it ferefully to inuade thē, furiousely\r\nhandle them, spedily oppresse them, vnmercyfully choke them, and that\r\nin no small numbers, and such persons so notably noble in birthe,\r\ngoodly conditions, graue sobrietie, singular wisedōe, and great\r\nlearnynge, as Henry Duke of Suffolke, and the lorde Charles his\r\nbrother, as fewe hath bene sene lyke of their age: an heuy & pitifull\r\nthyng to here or see. So that if by onely learned men in phisicke &\r\nnot this waye also it should be holpen, it were nedeful almost halfe\r\nso many learned men to be redy in euery toune and citie, as their\r\nshould be sweatynge sicke folkes. Yet this notwithstandynge, I wyll\r\neuery man not to refuse the counseill of the present or nighe physicen\r\nlearned, who maie, accordyng to the place, persone, cause, & other\r\ncircūstances, geue more particular counseil at nede, but in any wise\r\nexhorte him to seke it with all diligence. To this enterprise also\r\namonge so many learned men, not a litle stirreth me the gentilnes and\r\ngood willes of al sortes of men, which I haue well proued heretofore by\r\nmy other former bokes. Mindynge therefore with as good a will to geue\r\nmy counseil in this, and trusting for no lesse gentlenes in the same, I\r\nwyll plainly and in English for their better vnderstandynge to whome I\r\nwrite, firste declare the beginnynge, name, nature, and signes of the\r\nsweatynge sickenes. Next, the causes of the same. And thirdly, how to\r\npreserue men frō it, and remedy them whē they haue it.\r\n\r\n_The beginnyng of the disease._—In the yere of our Lorde God\r\nM.CCCC.lxxxv. shortly after the vij. daye of august, at whiche tyme\r\nkynge Henry the seuenth arriued at Milford in walles, out of Fraunce,\r\nand in the firste yere of his reigne, ther chaunced a disease among\r\nthe people, lastyng the reste of that monethe & all september, which\r\nfor the soubdeine sharpenes and vnwont cruelnes passed the pestilence.\r\nFor this commonly geueth iij. or iiij. often vij. sumtyme ix. as that\r\nfirste at Athenes whiche _Thucidides_ describeth in his seconde boke,\r\nsumtyme xj. and sumtyme xiiij. dayes respecte, to whome it vexeth.\r\nBut that immediatly killed some in opening theire windowes, some in\r\nplaieng with children in their strete dores, some in one hour, many in\r\ntwo it destroyed, & at the longest, to thē that merilye dined, it gaue\r\na sorowful Supper. As it founde them so it toke them, some in sleape\r\nsome in wake, some in mirthe some in care, some fasting & some ful,\r\nsome busy and some idle, and in one house sometyme three sometime fiue,\r\nsometyme seuen sometyme eyght, sometyme more some tyme all, of the\r\nwhyche, if the haulfe in euerye Towne escaped, it was thoughte great\r\nfauour. How, or wyth what maner it toke them, with what grieffe, and\r\naccidentes it helde theym, herafter thē I wil declare, whē I shal come\r\nto shewe the signes therof. In the mene space, know that this disease\r\n(because it most did stand in sweating from the beginning vntil the\r\nendyng) was called here, the Sweating sickenesse: and because it firste\r\nbeganne in Englande, it was named in other countries, the englishe\r\nsweate. Yet some coniecture that it, or the like, hath bene before\r\nseene among the Grekes in the siege of Troie. In thēperor Octauius\r\nwarres at _Cantabria_, called nowe Biscaie, in Hispaine: and in the\r\nTurkes, at the Rhodes. How true that is, let the aucthours loke: how\r\ntrue thys is, the best of our Chronicles shewith, & of the late begonne\r\ndisease the freshe memorie yet confirmeth. But if the name wer now to\r\nbe geuen, and at my libertie to make the same: I would of the maner and\r\nspace of the disease (by cause the same is no sweat only, as herafter\r\nI will declare, & in the spirites) make the name _Ephemera_, which is\r\nto sai, a feuer of one natural dai. A feuer, for the feruor or burning,\r\ndrieth & sweating feure like. Of one naturall day, for that it lasteth\r\nbut the time of xxiiij. houres. And for a distinction from the commune\r\n_Ephemera_, that Galene writeth of, comming both of other causes,\r\nand wyth vnlike paines, I wold putte to it either Englishe, for that\r\nit followeth somoche English menne, to whō it is almoste proper, and\r\nalso began here: or els pestilent, for that it cōmeth by infection &\r\nputrefaction, otherwise then doth the other _Ephemera_. Whiche thing I\r\nsuppose may the better be done, because I se straunge and no english\r\nnames both in Latine and Greke by commune vsage taken for Englishe.\r\nAs in Latin, Feure, Quotidiā, Tertian, Quartane, Aier, Infection,\r\nPestilence, Uomite, Person, Reines, Ueines, Peines, Chamere, Numbre,\r\n&c. a litle altered by the commune pronunciation. In Greke, Pleuresie,\r\nIschiada, Hydrops, Apostema, Phlegma, and Chole: called by the vulgare\r\npronunciatiō, Schiatica, Dropsie, Impostume, Phleume, & Choler: Gyne\r\nalso, and Boutyre, Sciourel, Mouse, Rophe, Phrase, Paraphrase, & cephe,\r\nwherof cometh Chaucers couercephe, in the romant of the Rose, writtē\r\nand pronoūced comōly, kerchief in y^e south, & courchief in the north.\r\nThereof euery head or principall thing, is comonlye called cephe,\r\npronoūced & writtē, chief. Uery many other there be in our commune\r\ntongue, whiche here to rehearse were to long. These for an example\r\nshortelye I haue here noted. But for the name of this disease it maketh\r\nnow no matter, the name of Sweat beyng cōmōly vsed. Let vs therfore\r\nreturne to the thing, which as occasiō & cause serued, came againe in\r\nthe M.D.vi. the xxii. yeare of the said Kyng Henry the seuenth. Aftre\r\nthat, in the yeare M.D.xvii. the ix. yeare of Kyng Henry the viii,\r\nand endured from July, vnto y^e middest of Decēbre. The iiii tyme, in\r\nthe yeare M.D.xxviii. the xx. yeare of thesaied Kyng, beginning in\r\nthende of May, & continuing June and July. The fifth tyme of this\r\nfearful _Ephemera_ of Englande, and pestilent sweat, is this in the\r\nyeare M.D.LI. of oure Lorde GOD, and the fifth yeare of oure Souereigne\r\nLorde king Edwarde the sixth, beginning at Shrewesbury in the middest\r\nof April, proceadinge with greate mortalitie to Ludlowe, Prestene, and\r\nother places in Wales, then to Westchestre, Couentre, Drenfoorde, and\r\nother tounes in the Southe, and suche as were in and aboute the way\r\nto London, whether it came notablie the seuenth of July, and there\r\ncontinuing sore, with the losse of vii. C. lxi. from the ix. day vntil\r\nthe xvi. daye, besides those that died in the vii. and viii. dayes, of\r\nwhō no registre was kept, frō that it abated vntil the xxx. day of the\r\nsame, with the losse of C. xlii. more. Then ceassing there, it wente\r\nfrom thence throughe al the east partes of England into the Northe\r\nvntill the ende of Auguste, at whiche tyme it diminished, and in the\r\nende of Septembre fully ceassed.\r\n\r\nThis disease is not a Sweat onely, (as it is thought & called) but a\r\nfeuer, as I saied, in the spirites by putrefaction venemous, with a\r\nfight, trauaile, and laboure of nature againste the infection receyued\r\nin the spirites, whervpon by chaunce foloweth a Sweate, or issueth an\r\nhumour compelled by nature, as also chanceth in other sicknesses whiche\r\nconsiste in humours, when they be in their state, and at the worste\r\nin certein dayes iudicial, aswel by vomites, bledinges, & fluxes, as\r\nby sweates. That this is true, the self sweates do shewe. For as in\r\nvtter businesses, bodies yt sore do labour, by trauail of the same are\r\nforced to sweat, so in inner diseases, the bodies traueiled & labored\r\nby thē, are moued to the like. In which labors, if nature be strōg &\r\nable to thrust out the poisō by sweat (not otherwise letted) ye persō\r\nescapeth: if not, it dieth. That it is a feuer, thus I haue partly\r\ndeclared, and more wil streight by the notes of the disease, vnder\r\none shewing also by thesame notes, signes, and short tariance of the\r\nsame, that it consisteth in the spirites. First by the peine in the\r\nbacke, or shoulder, peine in the extreme partes, as arme, or legge,\r\nwith a flusshing, or wind, as it semeth to certeine of the pacientes,\r\nflieng in the same. Secondly by the grief in the liuer and the nigh\r\nstomacke. Thirdely, by the peine in the head, & madnes of the same.\r\nFourthly by the passion of the hart. For the flusshing or wynde comming\r\nin the vtter and extreame partes, is nothing els but the spirites of\r\nthose same gathered together, at the first entring of the euell aire,\r\nagaynste the infection therof, and flyeng thesame from place to place,\r\nfor theire owne sauegarde. But at the last infected, they make a\r\ngrief where thei be forced, whiche cōmonly is in tharme or legge (the\r\nfartheste partes of theire refuge) the backe or shulder: trieng ther\r\nfirst a brūt as good souldiers, before they wil let their enemye come\r\nfurther into theire dominion. The other grefes be therefore in thother\r\npartes aforsaid & sorer, because the spirites be there most plētuous\r\nas in their founteines, whether alwaies thinfection desireth to go.\r\nFor frō the liuer, the nigh stomack, braine, and harte, come all the\r\niij. sortes, and kyndes of spirites, the gouernoures of oure bodies,\r\nas firste spronge there. But from the hart, the liuish spirites. In\r\nputrifieng wherof by the euel aier in bodies fit for it, the harte is\r\noppressed. Wherupon also foloweth a marueilous heauinesse, (the fifthe\r\ntoken of this disease,) and a desire to sleape, neuer contented, the\r\nsenses in al partes beynge as they were bounde or closed vp, the partes\r\ntherfore left heuy, vnliuishe, and dulle. Laste foloweth the shorte\r\nabidinge, a certeine Token of the disease to be in the spirites, as wel\r\nmay be proued by the _Ephemera_ that Galene writethe of, whiche because\r\nit consistethe in the Spirites, lasteth but one natural day. For as\r\nfire in hardes or straw, is sone in flambe & sone oute, euen so heate\r\nin the spirites, either by simple distemperature, or by infection and\r\nputrefaction therin conceyued, is sone in flambe & sone out, and soner\r\nfor the vehemencye or greatnes of the same, whiche without lingering,\r\nconsumeth sone the light matter, contrary to al other diseases restyng\r\nin humoures, wherin a fire ones kindeled, is not so sone put out, no\r\nmore then is the same in moiste woode, or fat Sea coles, as well by\r\nthe particular Example of the pestilence, (of al others most lyke\r\nvnto this) may be declared, whyche by that it stādeth in euel humors,\r\ntarieth as I said, sometyme, from iiij. vii. ix. & xj. vntill xiiij.\r\ndayes, differentlie from this, by reason therof, albeit by infection\r\nmost lyke to this same. Thus vnder one laboure shortelie I haue\r\ndeclared—both what this disease is, wherein it consisteth, howe and\r\nwith what accidentes it grieueth and is differente from the Pestilence,\r\nand the propre signes, and tokens of the same, without the whiche,\r\nif any do sweate, I take theym not to Sweate by this Sickenesse, but\r\nrather by feare, heate of the yeare, many clothes, greate exercise,\r\naffection, excesse in diete, or at the worst, by a smal cause of\r\ninfection, and less disposition of the bodi to this sicknes. So that,\r\ninsomoche as the body was nat al voide of matter, sweate it did when\r\ninfection came: but in that the mattere was not greate, the same coulde\r\nneyther be perilous nor paineful as in others, in whom was greater\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n_The causes._—Hetherto I haue shewed the beginning, name, nature, &\r\nsignes of this disease: nowe I will declare the causes, which be ij.:\r\ninfectiō, & impure spirites in bodies corrupt by repletiō. Infection,\r\nby thaire receiuing euel qualities, distēpring not only y^e hete, but\r\nthe hole substāce therof, in putrifieng thesame, and that generally ij.\r\nwaies. By the time of the yere vnnatural, & by the nature & site of the\r\nsoile & region—wherunto maye be put the particular accidentes of this\r\nsame. By the time of the yeare vnnaturall, as if winter be hot & drie,\r\nsomer hot and moist: (a fit time for sweates) the spring colde and\r\ndrye, the fall hot & moist. To this mai be ioyned the euel disposition\r\nby constellation, whiche hath a great power & dominion in al erthly\r\nthinges. By the site & nature of the soile & regiō, many wayes. First\r\n& specially by euel mistes & exhalatiōs drawen out of the grounde\r\nby the sūne in the heate of the yeare, as chanced amōg the Grekes in\r\nthe siege of Troy, wherby died firste dogges & mules, after, mē in\r\ngreat numbre: & here also in Englād in this m.d.lj. yeare, the cause\r\nof this pestilent sweate, but of dyuers nature. Whiche miste in the\r\ncountrie wher it began, was sene flie frō toune to toune, with suche\r\na stincke in morninges & eueninges, that mē could scarcely abide it.\r\nThē by dampes out of the earth, as out of Galenes _Barathrū_, or the\r\npoetes _auernū_, or _aornū_, the dampes wherof be such, that thei kil\r\ny^e birdes fliēg ouer them. Of like dampes, I heard in the north coūtry\r\nin cole pits, wherby the laboring mē be straight killed, except before\r\nthe houre of coming therof (which thei know by y^e flame of their\r\ncādle) thei auoid the groūd. Thirdly by putrefactiō or rot in groūdes\r\naftre great flouddes, in carions, & in dead men. After great fluddes,\r\nas happened in y^e time of Gallien thēperor at rome, in _Achaia_ &\r\n_Libia_, wher the seas sodeinly did ouerflow y^e cities nigh to y^t\r\nsame. And in the xi. yeare of _Pelagius_, when al the flouddes throughe\r\nal Italye didde rage, but chieflye _Tibris_ at Rome, whiche in many\r\nplaces was as highe as the walles of the citie.\r\n\r\nIn cariōs or dead bodies, as fortuned here in Englande vpon the sea\r\nbanckes in the tyme of King Alured, or Alfrede; (as some Chroniclers\r\nwrite) but in the time of king Ethelred after Sabellicus, by occasion\r\nof drowned Locustes cast vp by the Sea, which by a wynde were driuen\r\noute of Fraunce thether. This locust is a flie in bignes of a mānes\r\nthumbe, in colour broune, in shape somewhat like a greshopper, hauing\r\nvi. fiete, so many wynges, two tiethe, & an hedde like a horse, and\r\ntherfore called in Italy _Caualleto_, where ouer y^e city of _Padoa_,\r\nin the yeare m.d.xiij. (as I remembre,) I, with manye more did see a\r\nswarme of theim, whose passage ouer the citie, did laste two hours,\r\nin breadth inestimable to euery man there. Here by example to note\r\ninfection by deadde menne in Warres, either in rotting aboue the\r\nground, as chaunced in Athenes by theim of Ethiopia, or els in beyng\r\nburied ouerly as happened at Bulloigne, in the yere M.D.xlv. the\r\nyeare aftre king Henrye theight had conquered the same, or by long\r\ncontinuance of an hoste in one place, it is more playne by dayly\r\nexperience, then it neadeth to be shewed. Therefore I wil now go to\r\nthe fourth especial cause of infectiō, the pent aier, breaking out of\r\nthe ground in yearthquakes, as chaunced at Uenice in the first yeare\r\nof _Andrea Dandulo_, then Duke, the xxiiij. day of Januarye, and xx.\r\nhour after their computacion. By which infectiō mani died, & many were\r\nborne before their time. The v. cause is close, & vnstirred aire, &\r\ntherfore putrified or corrupt, out of old welles, holes in y^e groūd\r\nmade for grain, wherof many I did se in & about _Pesaro_ in Italy, by\r\nopenīg thē aftre a great space, as both those coūtrimē do cōfesse, &\r\nalso by exāple is declared, for y^e manye in openīg thē vnwarely be\r\nkilled. Out of caues, & tōbes also, as chaūced first in the country of\r\n_Babilonia_, proceding aftre into Grece, and so to Rome, by occasion\r\nthat y^e souldiers of themperour _Marcus Antoninus_, vpon hope of\r\nmoney, brake up a golden coffine of _Auidius Cassius_, spiēg a litle\r\nhole therin, in the tēple of _Apollo_ in _Seleucia_, as _Ammianus\r\nMarcellinus_ writeth. To these mai be ioyned the particular causes of\r\ninfectiō, which I cal the accidentes of the place, augmenting thesame.\r\nAs nigh to dwelling places, merishe & muddy groundes, puddles or\r\ndonghilles, sinkes or canales, easing places or carions, deadde ditches\r\nor rotten groundes, close aier in houses or ualleis, with suche like.\r\nThus muche for the firste cause.\r\n\r\nThe second cause of this Englyshe _Ephemera_, I said were thimpure\r\nspirites in bodies corupt by repletiō. Repletion I cal here, abundance\r\nof humores euel & maliciouse, from long time by litle & litle gathered\r\nby euel diete, remaining in the bodye, coming either by to moche\r\nmeate, or by euel meate in qualitie, as infected frutes, meates of\r\neuel iuse or nutrimēt; or both ioyntly. To such spirites when the aire\r\ninfectiue cometh cōsonant, thē be thei distēpered, corrupted, sore\r\nhandled; & oppressed, thē nature is forced, & the disease engendred.\r\nBut while I doe declare these impure spirites to be one cause, I must\r\nremoue your myndes frō spirites to humours, for that the spirites\r\nbe fedde of the finest partes therof, & aftre bringe you againe to\r\nspirites where I toke you. And forsomuche as I haue not yet forgotten\r\nto whome I write, in this declaration I will leaue a part al learned\r\n& subtil reasōs, as here void & vnmiete, & only vse suche as be most\r\neuident to whom I write, & easiest to be vnderstanden of the same:\r\nand at ones therwith shew also why it haūteth vs English men more thē\r\nother nations. Therfore I passe ouer the vngētle sauoure or smell of\r\nthe sweate, grosenes, colour, and other qualities of the same, the\r\nquantitie, the daunger in stopping, the maner in coming furthe redily,\r\nor hardly, hot or cold, the notes in the excremētes, the state longer\r\nor sorer, with suche others, which mai be tokēs of corrupt humours &\r\nspirites, & onli wil stād upō iii. reasōs declaring y^e same swet by\r\ngret repletiō to be in vs not otherwise for al the euel aire apt to\r\nthis disease, more thē other natiōs. For as hereaftre I wil shew, &\r\nGalē cōfirmeth, our bodies cā not suffre any thīg or hurt by corrupt\r\n& infectiue causes, except ther be in thē a certeī mater prepared apt\r\n& like to receiue it, els if one were sick, al shuld be sick, if in\r\nthis countri, in al coūtres wher the infection came, which thīg we\r\nse doth not chāce. For touching the first reasō, we se this sweting\r\nsicknes or pestilēt _Ephemera_, to be oft in Englād, but neuer entreth\r\nScotland, (except the borders) albeit thei both be ioinctly within\r\nthe cōpas of on sea. The same begining here, hath assailed Brabant &\r\nthe costes nigh to it, but neuer, passed Germany, where ones it was\r\nin like faciō as here, with great mortalitie, in the yere m.d.xxix.\r\nCause wherof none other there is naturall, then the euell diet of\r\nthese thre contries whiche destroy more meates and drynckes withoute\r\nal ordre, cōueniēt time, reasō, or necessite, thē either Scotlande,\r\nor all other countries vnder the sunne, to the greate annoiance of\r\ntheir owne bodies and wittes, hinderance of theim which have nede,\r\nand great dearth and scarcitie in their cōmon welthes. Wherfore if\r\n_Esculapius_ the inuentour of phisike, y^e sauer of mē from death, and\r\nrestorer to life, should returne again īto this world, he could not\r\nsaue these sortes of men, hauing so moche sweatyng stuffe, so many\r\neuill humoures laid vp in store, frō this displeasante, feareful, &\r\npestilent disease: except thei would learne a new lesson, & folowe a\r\nnew trade. For other wise, neither the auoidyng of this countrie (the\r\nseconde reason) nor fleyng into others, (a commune refuge in other\r\ndiseases) wyll preserue vs Englishe men, as in this laste sweate is by\r\nexperience well proued in Cales, Antwerpe, and other places of Brabant,\r\nwher only our contrimen ware sicke, & none others, except one or ii.\r\nothers of thenglishe diete, which is also to be noted. The cause hereof\r\nnatural is onely this, that they caried ouer with thē, & by lyke diete\r\nther incresed that whiche was the cause of their disease. Wherefore\r\nlette vs asserteine our selues, that in what soeuer contrie lyke cause\r\nand matter is, there commyng like aier and cause efficient, wil make\r\nlyke effecte and disease in persōs of agreable complexions, age, and\r\ndiete, if the tyme also doe serue to these same, and in none others.\r\nThese I putte, for that the tyme of the yere hote, makethe moche to\r\nthe malice of the disease, in openynge the pores of the body, lettynge\r\nin the euill aier, resoluynge the humores and makynge them flowable,\r\nand disposing therfore the spirites accordyngly, besyde, that (as I\r\nshewed in the first cause of this pestilente sweate) it stirreth and\r\ndraweth out of the erthe euill exhalations and mistes, to thinfection\r\nof the aier and displeasure of vs. Diet I put, for that they of the\r\ncontrarie diete be not troubled with it at all. Age and complexion,\r\nfor this, that although it spareth nō age of bothe kyndes, nor no\r\ncomplexion but some it touchethe, yet for the most parte (wherby rules\r\nand reasones be alwayes to be made) it vexed theim of the middle age,\r\nbeste luste, and theim not moch vnder that, and of complexions hote &\r\nmoiste, as fitteste by their naughty & moche subtiltie of blode to fede\r\nthe spirites: or nigh and lyke to thesame in some one of the qualities,\r\nas cholerike in hete, phlegmatike in moister, excepte thother their\r\nqualities, as drinesse in cholerike, & cold in phlegmatike, by great\r\ndominion ouer thother, did lette. For the clene contrarie complexiōs\r\nto the infected aier, alwaies remaine helthful, saulfe and better then\r\ntofore, the corrupte and infected aier notwithstandyng. Therfore cold\r\nand drie persones either it touched not at all, or very fewe, and that\r\nwyth no danger: such I say as beside their complexion, (whiche is so\r\nharde to finde in any man exacte and simple, as exacte helthes) were\r\nannoied with some corrupt humoures & spirites, and therfore mete by so\r\nmoch to receiue it, & that by good reasō. For nothing can naturally\r\nhaue power to do ought against any thing, excepte the same haue in\r\nit selfe a disposicion by like qualities to receiue it. As the cause\r\nin the fote cānot trouble the flanke and leue the knee (the mean\r\nbetwixte) except there were a greater consent and likenes of nature in\r\nsufferance (whiche we call _sympathian_) betwixte those then thother.\r\nNor fire refusynge stones, canne burne hardes, strawe, stickes and\r\ncharcole, oile, waxe, fatte, and seacole, except these same first of\r\nal wer apte, and by conuenient qualities disposed to be enflamed and\r\nburned. Nor any man goeth about to burne water, because the qualities\r\nthereof be contrary, and the body vndisposed to the like of fire. By\r\nwhiche reason it may also be perceiued, that y^e venemouse qualitie\r\nof this corrupt aire is hote and moiste, for it redily enfectethe the\r\nlyke complexions, and those nigh vnto theim, and the contrary not\r\nat all, or hardly: & easely doth putrify, as doe the Southe wyndes.\r\nTherfore next vnto those colde and drie cōplexions, olde men escaped\r\nfree, as like to theim by age: and children, as voide of replecion\r\nconsumed by their great hete, and therefore alwaies redy to eate. But\r\nin this disease the subtile humour euill and abundant in full bodies\r\nfedyng y^e spirites, is more to be noted then the humour complexional,\r\nwhiche notwithstanding, as an helper or hinderer to y^e same, is not\r\nto be neglected. For els it should be in all contries and persones\r\nindifferently, wher all complexiones be. The thirde and laste reason\r\nis, y^t they which had thys sweat sore with perille or death, were\r\neither men of welthe, ease, & welfare, or of the poorer sorte such as\r\nwer idle persones, good ale drinkers, and Tauerne haunters. For these,\r\nby y^e great welfare of the one sorte, and large drinkyng of thother,\r\nheped vp in their bodies moche euill matter: by their ease and idlenes,\r\ncoulde not waste and consume it. A comfirmacion of this is, that the\r\nlaborouse and thinne dieted people, either had it not, because they dyd\r\neate but litle to make the matter: or with no greate grefe and danger,\r\nbecause they laboured out moche thereof. Wherefore vpon small cause,\r\nnecessarily must folowe a smal effecte. All these reasones go to this\r\nende, that persones of all contries of moderate and good diete, escape\r\nthys Englishe _Ephemera_, and those be onely vexed therewith, whiche\r\nbe of immoderate and euill diete. But why? for the euill humores and\r\ncorrupte aier alone? No, for thē the pestilence and not the swet should\r\nrise. For what then? For y^e impure spirites corrupte in theim selues\r\nand by the infectiue aier. Why so? for that of impure and corrupte\r\nhumores, whether thei be blode or others, can rise none other then\r\nimpure spirites. For euery thynge is suche as that whereof it commeth.\r\nNow, that of the beste and fineste of the blode, yea in corrupte bodies\r\n(whyche beste is nought) these spirites be ingendred and fedde, I\r\nbefore expressed. Therfor who wyl haue them pure and cleane, and him\r\nselfe free from sweat, muste kepe a pure and cleane diete, and then he\r\nshalbe sure.\r\n\r\n_The preseruacion._—Infection by the aier, and impure spirites by\r\nrepletion thus founde and declared to be the causes of this pestilente\r\nsweate or Englishe _ephemera_, lette vs nowe see howe we maye preserue\r\nour selues from it, and howe it may be remedied, if it chaunce, wyth\r\nlesse mortalitie. I wyll begynne wyth preseruation. That most of all\r\ndothe stande in auoidyng the causes to come of the disease, the thinges\r\nhelping forward the same, and remouyng that whiche is alredy had &\r\ngotten. Al be done by the good order of thynges perteynyng to the\r\nstate of the body. Therfore I will begin with diete where I lefte, &\r\nthen go furth with aier where I beganne in treatyng the causes, and\r\ndeclare the waie to auoide infection, and so furthe to the reste in\r\norder. Who that lustethe to lyue in quiete suretie, out of the sodaine\r\ndanger of this Englishe _ephemera_, he aboue all thynges, of litle and\r\ngood muste eate & spare not, the laste parte wherof wyl please well\r\n(I doubt not) vs Englishe men: the firste I thinke neuer a deale. Yet\r\nit must please theim that entende to lyue without the reche of this\r\ndisease. So doyng, they shall easely escape it. For of that is good,\r\ncan be engendred no euill: of that is litle, can be gathered no great\r\nstore. Therfore helthful must he nedes be and free from this disease,\r\nthat vsethe this kinde of liuynge and maner in dietynge. An example\r\nhereof may the wise man _Socrates_ be, which by this sorte of diete\r\nescaped a sore pestilence in Athenes, neuer fleynge ne kepyng close him\r\nselfe from the same. Truly who will lyue accordynge to nature and not\r\nto lust, may with this diete be well contented. For nature is pleased\r\nwith a litle, nor seketh other then that the mind voide of cares and\r\nfeares may be in quiete merily, and the body voide of grefe, maye be in\r\nlife swetly, as _Lucretius_ writeth. Here at large to ronne out vntill\r\nmy breth wer spent, as vpon a common place, against y^e intemperāce\r\nor excessiue diete of Englande, thincommodities & displeasures of\r\nthe same many waies: and contrarie, in commēdation of meane diete\r\nand temperance (called of _Plato sophrosyne_, for that it cōserneth\r\nwisdome) and the thousande commodities therof, both for helthe, welthe,\r\nwitte, and longe life, well I might, & lose my laboure: such be our\r\nEnglishe facions rather then reasones. But for that I purpose neither\r\nto wright a longe work but a shorte counseill, nor to wery the reders\r\nwith that they luste not to here, I will lette that passe, and moue thē\r\nthat desire further to knowe my mynde therin, to remember that I sayd\r\nbefore, of litle & good eate and spare not, wherby they shall easely\r\nperceiue my meanyng. I therefore go furth with my diete, wherin my\r\ncounseill is, that the meates be helthfull, and holsomly kylled, swetly\r\nsaued, and wel prepared in rostyng, sethyng, baking, & so furth. The\r\nbred, of swet corne, well leuened, and so baked. The drinke of swete\r\nmalte and good water kyndly brued, without other drosse nowe a daies\r\nvsed. No wine in all the tyme of sweatyng, excepte to suche whose\r\nsickenes require it for medicin, for fere of inflamynge & openynge,\r\nnor except y^e halfe be wel soden water. In other tymes, old, pure, &\r\nsmal. Wishīg for the better executiō hereof & ouersight of good and\r\nhelthsome victalles, ther wer appointed certein masters of helth in\r\neuery citie and toune, as there is in Italie, whiche for the good order\r\nin all thynges, maye be in al places an example. The meates I would to\r\nbe veale, muttone, kidde, olde lambe, chikyn, capone, henne, cocke,\r\npertriche, phesane, felfare, smal birdes, pigeon, yong pecockes, whose\r\nfleshe by a certeine natural & secrete propertie neuer putrefie, as\r\nhath bene proued. Conies, porke of meane age, neither fatte nor leane,\r\nthe skynne takē awaye, roste, & eatē colde: Tartes of prunes, gelies\r\nof veale & capone. Yong befe in this case a litle poudered is not to\r\nbe dispraised, nor new egges & good milke. Butter in a mornyng with\r\nsage and rewe fastynge in the sweatynge tyme, is a good preseruatiue,\r\nbeside that it nourisheth. Crabbes, crauesses, picrel, perche, ruffe,\r\ngogion, lampreis out of grauelly riuers, smeltes, dace, barbell,\r\ngornerd, whityng, soles, flunders, plaice, millers thumbes, minues, w^t\r\nsuch others, sodde in water & vinegre w^t rosemary, time, sage, & hole\r\nmaces, & serued hote. Yea swete salte fishe and linge, for the saltes\r\nsake wastynge y^e humores therof, which in many freshe fishes remaine,\r\nmaye be allowed well watered to thē that haue none other, & wel lyke\r\nit. Nor all fishes, no more then al fleshes be so euil as they be takē\r\nfor: as is wel declared in physik, & approued by the olde and wise\r\nromaines moche in their fisshes, lusty chartusianes neuer in fleshes,\r\n& helthful poore people more in fishe then fleshe. But we are nowe a\r\ndaies so vnwisely fine, and womanly delicate, that we may in no wise\r\ntouch a fisshe. The olde manly hardnes, stoute courage, & peinfulnes of\r\nEnglande is vtterly driuen awaye, in the stede wherof, men now a daies\r\nreceive womanlines, & become nice, not able to withstande a blaste of\r\nwynde, or resiste a poore fishe. And children be so brought vp, that if\r\nthey be not all daie by the fire with a toste and butire, and in their\r\nfurres, they be streight sicke.\r\n\r\nSauces to metes I appoint firste aboue all thynges good appetite, and\r\nnext Oliues, capers, iuse of lemones, Barberies, Pomegranetes, Orenges\r\nand Sorel, veriuse, & vineigre, iuse of vnripe Grapes, thepes or\r\nGoseberies. After mete, quinces, or marmalade, Pomegranates, Orenges\r\nsliced eaten with Suger, Succate of the pilles or barkes therof, and\r\nof pomecitres, olde apples and peres, Prunes, Reisons, Dates & Nuttes.\r\nFigges also, so they be taken before diner, els no frutes of that yere,\r\nnor rawe herbes or rotes in sallattes, for that in suche times they be\r\nsuspected to be partakers also of the enfected aire.\r\n\r\nOf aire so much I haue spoken before, as apperteinethe to the\r\ndeclaration of enfection therby. Nowe I wyl aduise and counseill howe\r\nto kepe the same pure, for somoche as may be, or lesse enfected, and\r\ncorrecte the same corrupte. The first is done in takynge a way y^e\r\ncauses of enfectiō. The seconde, by doynge in all pointes the contrary\r\nthereto. Take awaye the causes we maye, in damnyng diches, auoidynge\r\ncariōs, lettyng in open aire, shunning suche euil mistes as before I\r\nspake of, not openynge or sturrynge euill brethynge places, landynge\r\nmuddy and rottē groundes, burieng dede bodyes, kepyng canelles cleane,\r\nsinkes & easyng places sweat, remouynge dongehilles, boxe and euil\r\nsauouryng thynges, enhabitynge high & open places, close towarde the\r\nsowthe, shutte toward the winde, as reason wil & thexperience of _M.\r\nvarro_ in the pestilēce at _Corcyra_ confirmethe. Correcte in doyng\r\nthe contrary we shall, in dryenge the moiste with fyres, either in\r\nhouses or chambers, or on that side the cities, townes, & houses,\r\nthat lieth toward the infection and wynde commyng together, chefely\r\nin mornynges & eueninges, either by burnyng the stubble in the felde,\r\nor windfallynges in the woodes, or other wise at pleasure. By which\r\npolicie skilful _Acron_ deliuered Athenes in _Gretia_, and diuine\r\n_Hippocrates abderā in Thratia_ frō y^e pestilēce, & preserued frō\r\nthe same other the cities in _Grece_, at diuerse times cōyng with the\r\nwynde frō _æethiopia_, _illyria_ & _pŒonia_, by putting to the fires\r\nwel smelling garlādes, floures & odoures, as _Galene_ and _Soranus_\r\nwrite. Of like pollicie for purgyng the aier were the bonfires made\r\n(as I suppose) frō long time hetherto vsed in y^e middes of sommer,\r\nand not onely for vigiles. In cōfortyng the spirites also, and by\r\nalterynge the aier with swete odoures of roses, swet perfumes of the\r\nsame, rosemary leaues, baies, and white sanders cutte, afewe cloues\r\nsteped in rose water and vinegre rosate, the infection shalbe lesse\r\nnoious. With the same you maye also make you a swete house in castynge\r\nit abrode therin, if firste by auoidynge the russhes and duste, you\r\nmake the house clene. Haue alwaies in your handcercher for your nose\r\nand mouth, bothe with in your house and without, either the perfume\r\nbefore saide, or vinegre rosate: and in your mouth a pece either of\r\nsetwel, or of the rote of _enula campana_ wel steped before in vinegre\r\nrosate, a mace, or berie of Juniper. In wante of suche perfumes as is\r\nbeforesaide, take of mirrhe & drie rose leues of eche a lyke quantite,\r\nwith a little franke encense, for the like purpose, and caste it\r\nvpon the coles: or burne Juniper & their beries. And for so moche as\r\nclenelines is a great help to helthe, mine aduise is, that all your\r\nclothes be swete smellynge and clene, and that you wasshe your handes\r\nand face not in warme water, but with rose water and vinegre rosate\r\ncolde, or elles with the faire water and vinegre wherein the pilles\r\nor barkes of orenges and pomegranates are sodden: or the pilles of\r\npomecitres & sorel is boiled: for so you shalle close the pores ayenst\r\nthe ayre, that it redily entre not, and cole and tempre those partes so\r\nwasshed, accordynge to the right entente in curynge this disease. For\r\nin al the discurse, preseruatiō, and cure of thys disease, the chefe\r\nmarke & purpose is, to minister suche thynges as of their nature haue\r\nthe facultie by colyng dryenge and closyng, to resiste putrefaction,\r\nstrength and defende the spirites, comforte the harte, and kepe all\r\nthe body ayenst the displeasure of the corrupte aire. Wherfor it shal\r\nbe wel done, if you take of this cōposition folowyng euery mornyng\r\nthe weight of ij. d. in vi. sponefulles of water or iuleppe of Sorel,\r\n& cast it vpon your meate as pepper. ℞ seīs citri. acetos. ros. rub.\r\nsādal. citrin. ān. ʒ i boli armeni oriētal. ʒ i. s, terr. sigil. ʒ s,\r\nmargarit. ʒ i, fol. auri puri. n^o. iiij, misce. & f. pul. diuidatur\r\nad pōd. ʒ s. Or in the stede of this, take fasting the quantitie of a\r\nsmall bene of _Mithridatum_ or Uenice triacle in a sponeful of Sorel,\r\nor Scabious water, or by the selfe alone. And in goyng abrode, haue\r\nin youre hande either an handekercher with vinegre and rose water, or\r\na litle muske balle of nutmegges, maces, cloues, saffrō, & cinamome,\r\nof eche the weight of ij. d. finely beatē; of mastike the weight\r\nof ij. d. ob. of storax, v. d. of ladane x. d. of Ambre grise vi.\r\ngraines, of Muske iii. graines dissolued in ryght Muscadel: temper\r\nal together, & make a balle. In want of _Mithridatum_ or suche other\r\nas I haue before mencioned, vse dayly the Sirupes of Pomegranates,\r\nLemones, and Sorell, of eche half an vnce, with asmuche of the watres\r\nof Tormentille, Sorell, and Dragones, fasting in the morning, and one\r\nhoure before supper. A toste in vinegre or veriuse of Grapes, with a\r\nlitle poulder of Cinamome and Settewelle caste vppon it. Or two figges\r\nwith one nutte carnelle, and tenne leaues of rue in eche, and a litle\r\nsalt. Or boutire, rue, and sage, with breade in a morning eaten nexte\r\nyour harte, be as good preseruatiues, as theie be easye to be hadde.\r\nThese preseruatiues I here appoincte the more willingly among many\r\nothers further to be fetched, because these maye easelier be hadde, as\r\nat hande in niede, which now to finde is my most endeuour, as moste\r\nfruictfulle to whome I write. And this to be done I counsaille in the\r\nsickenesse tyme, when firste you heare it to be comming and begonne,\r\nbut not in the fitte. Alwayes remembryng, not to go out fastinge. For\r\nas _Cornelius Celsus_ wrytethe, Uenime or infection taketh holde muche\r\nsoner in a bodye yet fasting, then in the same not fastinge. Yet this\r\nis not so to be vnderstande, that in the mornynge we shal streight as\r\nour clothes be on, stuffe our bellies as fulle as Englishe menne, (as\r\nthe Frenche man saieth to our shames,) but to be contente with oure\r\npreseruatiues, or with a little meate bothe at breakefaste (if custome\r\nand nede so require) dynner and supper. For other wise nature, if the\r\ndisease shoulde take vs. shoulde haue more a doe againste the full\r\nbealy and fearce disease, then it were able to susteyne.\r\n\r\nAftre diete and ayer followethe filling or emptieng. Of filling in the\r\nname of repletiō I spake before. Of ēptieng, I will now shortely write\r\nas of a thing very necessary for the conseruation of mannes healthe.\r\nFor if that whiche is euel within, be not by good meanes & wayes wel\r\nfet oute, it often times destroyeth the lyfe. Good meanes to fet out\r\nthe euelle stuffe of the body be two, abstinence, & auoydance.\r\n\r\nAbstinence, in eatynge and drinckynge litle, as a lytle before I sayed,\r\nand seldome. For so, more goeth awaie then comethe, and by litle and\r\nlitle it wasteth the humours & drieth. Therfore (as I wiene) throughe\r\nthe counseil of Phisike, & by the good ciuile, & politique ordres,\r\ntēdring the wealth of many so much geuē to their bellies to their own\r\nhurtes & damages, not able for wāt of reasō to rule thē selues, &\r\ntherby enclined to al vices and diseases: for thauoiding of these same,\r\nincrease of vertue, witte and health, sauing victualles, making plenty,\r\nauoyding lothesomenesse or wearinesse, by chaunge, in taking sometime\r\nof that in the sea, and not alwaies destroieng y^t of the lande, an\r\nordre (without the whiche nothing can stand) and comon wealth, dayes of\r\nabstinence, and fasting were firste made, and not for religion onely.\r\n\r\nAuoidance, because it cānot be safely done withoute the healpe of a\r\ngood Phisicien, I let passe here, expressing howe it shoulde bee done\r\nduelye accordinge to the nature of the disease and the estate of the\r\npersonne, in an other booke made by me in Latine, vppon this same\r\nmatter and disease. Who therfore lusteth to see more, let him loke\r\nvpon that boke. Yet here thus much wil I say, that if after euacuation\r\nor auoiding of humors, the pores of the skinne remaine close, and y^e\r\nsweating excrement in the fleshe continueth grosse (whiche thinge howe\r\nto know, hereafter I will declare) then rubbe you the person meanly\r\nat home, & bathe him in faire water sodden with Fenel, Chamemil,\r\nRosemarye, Mallowes, & Lauendre, & last of al, powre water half colde\r\nouer al his body, and so dry him, & clothe him. Al these be to be don\r\na litle before y^e end of y^e spring, that the humours may be seatled,\r\nand at rest, before the time of the sweting, whiche cometh comonly\r\nin somer, if it cometh at al. For the tormoiling of the body in that\r\ntime when it ought to be most quiete, at rest, and armed against his\r\nenemy, liketh me not beste here, no more then in the pestilence. Yet\r\nfor the presente nede, if it be so thoughte good to a learned and\r\ndiscrete Phisicien, I condescend the rather. For as in thys, so in\r\nalle others before rehearsed, I remytte you to the discretion of a\r\nlearned manne in phisike, who maye iudge what is to be done, and how,\r\naccording to the present estate of youre bodies, nature, custome, and\r\nproprety, age, strength, delyghte and qualitie, tyme of the yeare, with\r\nother circumstaunces, and thereafter to geue the quantitie, and make\r\ndiuersitie of hys medicine. Other wise loke not to receiue by this boke\r\nthat good which I entend, but that euel which by your owne foly you\r\nvndiscretelye bring. For good counseil may be abused. And for me to\r\nwrite of euery particular estate and case, whiche be so manye as there\r\nbe menne, were so great almost a busines, as to numbre the sandes in\r\nthe sea. Therfore seke you out a good Phisicien, and knowen to haue\r\nskille, and at the leaste be so good to your bodies, as you are to your\r\nhosen or shoes, for the wel making or mending wherof, I doubt not but\r\nyou wil diligently searche out who is knowē to be the best hosier or\r\nshoemaker in the place where you dwelle: and flie the vnlearned as a\r\npestilence in a comune wealth. As simple women, carpenters, pewterers,\r\nbrasiers, sopeballesellers, pulters, hostellers, painters, apotecaries\r\n(otherwise then for their drogges,) auaunters thē selues to come from\r\nPole, Constantinople, Italie, Almaine, Spaine, Fraunce, Grece and\r\nTurkie, Inde, Egipt or Jury: from y^e seruice of Emperoures, kinges &\r\nquienes, promising helpe of al diseases, yea vncurable, with one or\r\ntwoo drinckes, by waters sixe monethes in continualle distillinge, by\r\n_Aurum potabile_, or _quintessence_, by drynckes of great and hygh\r\nprices, as though thei were made of the sūne, moone, or sterres,\r\nby blessynges and Blowinges, Hipocriticalle prayenges, and foolysh\r\nsmokynges of shirtes Smockes and kerchieffes, wyth suche others theire\r\nphantasies, and mockeryes, meaninge nothinge els but to abuse your\r\nlight belieue, and scorne you behind your backes with their medicines\r\n(so filthie, that I am ashamed to name theim) for your single wit and\r\nsimple belief, in trusting thē most, whiche you know not at al, and\r\nvnderstād least: like to them whiche thinke, farre foules haue faire\r\nfethers, althoughe thei be neuer so euel fauoured & foule: as thoughe\r\nthere coulde not be so conning an Englishman, as a foolish running\r\nstranger, (of others I speake not) or so perfect helth by honest\r\nlearning, as by deceiptfull ignorance. For in the erroure of these\r\nvnlerned, reasteth the losse of your honest estimation, diere bloudde,\r\nprecious spirites, and swiete lyfe, the thyng of most estimation and\r\nprice in this worlde, next vnto the immortal soule.\r\n\r\nFor consuming of euel matter within, and for making our bodies lustye,\r\ngaliard, & helthful, I do not a litle cōmende exercise, whiche in vs\r\nEnglishe men I allowe quick, and liuishe: as to runne after houndes\r\nand haukes, to shote, wrastle, play at Tēnes and weapons, tosse the\r\nwinde balle, skirmishe at base (an exercise for a gentlemanne, muche\r\nvsed among the Italianes,) and vaughting vpon an horse. Bowling, a\r\ngood excercise for women: castinge of the barre and camping, I accompt\r\nrather a laming of legges, then an exercise. Yet I vtterly reproue\r\ntheim not, if the hurt may be auoyded. For these a conueniente tyme\r\nis, before meate: due measure, reasonable sweatinge, in al times of\r\nthe yeare, sauing in the sweatinge tyme. In the whiche I allow rather\r\nquietnesse then exercise, for opening the body, in suche persons\r\nspecially as be liberally & freely brought vp. Others, except sitting\r\nartificers, haue theire exercises by daily labours in their occupatiōs,\r\nto whom nothing niedeth but solace onely, a thing conuenient for euery\r\nbodye that lusteth to liue in helth. For els as nō other thing, so\r\nnot healthe canne be longe durable. Thus I speake of solace, that I\r\nmeane not Idlenesse, wisshing alwayes no man to be idle, but to be\r\noccupied in some honest kinde of thing necessary in a cōmon welth.\r\nFor I accompt thē not worthi meate & drink in a cōmō welth, y^t be\r\nnot good for some purpose or seruice therin, but take thē rather as\r\nburdennes vnprofitable and heauye to the yearth, men borne to fille a\r\nnumbre only, and wast the frutes whiche therthe doeth grue, willing\r\nsoner to fiede the Lacedemonians old & croked asse, whiche labored for\r\nthe liuing so long as it coulde for age, then suche an idle Englisshe\r\nmanne. If the honestye and profite of honeste labour and exercise,\r\nconseruation of healthe, preseruation from sickenesse, maintenaunce\r\nof lyfe, aduancement, safety from shamefull deathes, defence from\r\nbeggerye, dyspleasures by idlenesse, shamefulle diseases by the same,\r\nhatefulle vices, and punishemente of the immortalle soule, canne not\r\nmoue vs to reasonable laboure and excercise, and to be profitable\r\nmembres of the commune welthe, let at the least shame moue vs, seyng\r\nthat other country menne, of nought, by their owne witte, diligence,\r\nlabour and actiuitie, can picke oute of a cast bone, a wrethen strawe,\r\na lyghte fether, or an hard stone, an honeste lyuinge: Nor ye shal\r\neuer heare theym say, alas master, I haue nō occupaciō, I must either\r\nbegge or steale. For they can finde other meanes betwene these two.\r\nAnd forsomuche as in the case that nowe is, miserable persons are\r\nto be relieued in a cōmon welth, I would wisshe for not fauouring\r\nthe idle, the discretion of _Marc. Cicero_ the romaine were vsed in\r\nhealping them: Who wolde compassion should be shewed vpon them, whome\r\nnecessitie compelled to do or make a faute: & no cōpassion vpon them,\r\nin whome a faulte made necessitie. A faulte maketh necessitie, in this\r\ncase of begging, in them, whyche might laboure and serue, & wil not\r\nfor idlenes: and therfore not to be pitied, but rather to be punished.\r\nNecessitie maketh a fault in thē, whiche wold labor and serue, but\r\ncānot for age, īpotēcy, or sickenes, and therfore to be pitied &\r\nrelieued. But to auoyde punishmente & to shew the waye to amendmente,\r\nI would again wishe, y^t forsomuch as we be so euel disposed of our\r\nselfes to our own profites and comodities with out help, this old law\r\nwere renued, which forbiddeth the nedy & impotent parentes, to be\r\nreleued of those their welthi chyldren, that by theym or theire meanes\r\nwere not broughte vppe, eyther in good learning and Science, or honeste\r\noccupation. For so is a man withoute science, as a realme withoute a\r\nkyng. Thus muche of exercise, and for exercise. To the which I wolde\r\nnow ioyne honeste companye betwene man and woman, as a parte of natural\r\nexercise, and healpe to y^e emptieng & lightning the bodye in other\r\ntymes allowed, in this sweating tyme for helthes sake, & for feare of\r\nopening the bodye, and resoluing the spirites, not approued, but for\r\ndout, that w^t lengthing the boke, I shold wery y^e reader. Therfore I\r\nlet y^t passe & come to sleping & waking, whiche without good ordre,\r\nbe gretly hurtful to the bodie. For auoiding the whiche, I take the\r\nmeane to be best, and against this sweat moste commendable. But if by\r\nexcesse a man must in eyther part offend, I permit rather to watch to\r\nmuche, then to lie in bedde to longe: so that in watchinge, there be no\r\nway to surfetting. Al these thinges duely obserued, and well executed,\r\nwhiche before I haue for preseruation mencioned, if more ouer we can\r\nsette a parte al affections, as fretting cares & thoughtes, dolefull\r\nor sorowfull imaginations, vaine feares, folysh loues, gnawing hates,\r\nand geue oure selues to lyue quietly, frendlie, & merily one with an\r\nouther, as men were wont to do in the old world, whē this countrie\r\nwas called merye Englande, and euery man to medle in his own matters,\r\nthinking theim sufficient, as thei do in Italye, and auoyde malyce and\r\ndissencion, the destruction of commune wealthes, and priuate houses: I\r\ndoubte not but we shall preserue oure selues, bothe from this sweatinge\r\nsyckenesse, and other diseases also not here purposed to be spoken of.\r\n\r\n_The cure or remedy._—But if in leauinge a parte these or some of them,\r\nor negligently executing them, it chaunceth the disease of sweating\r\nto trouble our bodies, then passinge the bondes and compasse of\r\npreseruation, we must come to curation, the way to remedie the disease,\r\n& the third and last parte (as I first sayed) to be entreated in this\r\nboke. The principalle entente herof, is to let out the venime by sweate\r\naccordinge to the course of nature. This is brought to passe safely\r\ntwo waies, by suffring and seruing handsomly nature, if it thruste it\r\noute readily and kindely: and helping nature, if it be letted, or be\r\nweake in expellinge. Serue nature we shall, if in what time so euer\r\nit taketh vs, or what so euer estate, we streyghte lay vs downe vppon\r\noure bedde, yf we be vp and in oure clothes, not takyinge them of:\r\nor lie stille, if we be in bed out of our clothes, laiyng on clothes\r\nboth wayes, if we wante, reasonably, and not loadinge vs therewith\r\nvnmeasurably. Thus layed and couered, we must endeuoure our selues so\r\nto continue wyth al quietnes, & for so much as may be without feare,\r\ndistruste, or faintehartednesse, an euel thinge in al diseases. For\r\nsuche surrendre and geue ouer to the disease without resistence. By\r\nwhiche occasion manye more died in the fyrste pestilence at _Athenes_,\r\nthat I spake of in the beginnynge of thys boke, then other wyse should.\r\nOure kepers, friendes and louers, muste also endeuoure theym selues\r\nto be handesome and dilygente aboute vs, to serue vs redilye at al\r\nturnes, and neuer to leaue vs duringe foure and twentie houres, but\r\nto loke welle vnto vs, that neyther we caste of oure clothes, nor\r\nthruste out hande or foote, duryng the space of the saide foure and\r\ntwenty houres. For albeit the greate daungere be paste after twelue\r\nhoures, or fourtene, the laste of trial, yet many die aftre by to muche\r\nboldenes, when thei thinke theim selues most in suretye, or negligence\r\nin attendaunce, when they thinke no necessitie. Wherby it is proued\r\nthat without dout, the handsome diligence, or carelesse negligence, is\r\nthe sauing, or casting awaye of many. If ij. be taken in one bed, let\r\ntheym so continue, althoughe it be to their vnquietnesse. For feare\r\nwherof, & for the more quietnesse & safetye, very good it is duryng all\r\nthe sweating time, that two persones lye not in one bed. If with this\r\nquietnes, diligēce, and ordre, the sicke do kindelye sweate, suffre\r\nthem so to continue, without meate all the xxiiij. houres: withoute\r\ndrincke, vntil the fifth houre, if it maie be. Alwayes taking hede to\r\ntheim in the fourth, seuenth, nineth, & eleuenth houres speciallye, and\r\nfourteenth also, as the laste of triall and daungier, but of lesse in\r\nbothe. For these be most perilous, as I haue obserued this yere in this\r\ndisease, hauing y^e houres iudicial, as others haue theire dayes, and\r\ntherfore worse to geue anye thinge in, for troublyng nature standyng\r\nin trialle. Yet wher more daunger is in forbearyng then in takyng, I\r\ncounseill not to spare in these howres to do as the case requireth with\r\nwisdome & discretion, but lesse then in other howres. In the fifthe\r\nhowre geue theim to drinke clarified ale made only doulcet with a litle\r\nsuger, out of a cruet, or glasse made in cruet facion, with a nebbe,\r\nfor feare of raisynge theim selues to receiue the drinke offered, & so\r\nto let the sweat, by the ayer strikyng in. But if the sicke on this\r\nwise beforesaid cānot sweate kyndly, then nature must be holpen, as I\r\nsayd before. And for so moch as sweat is letted in this disease fower\r\nwaies, by disorder, wekenes of nature, closenes of the pores in the\r\nskinne, & grosnes of the humoures: my counseil is to auoide disorder by\r\nsuche meanes as hetherto I haue taught, and next to open the pores if\r\nthey be close, and make thinne the matter, if it be grosse, and prouoke\r\nsweat, if nature be weke. Those you shal doe by gentle rubbynges,\r\nthis by warme drinckes as hereafter streight I will declare. And for\r\nthat euery man hath not the knowlege to discerne which of these is\r\nthe cause of let in sweatyng, I wil shewe you plainly howe to do with\r\nmoste suretie and leste offense. I wyll beginne with wekenes of nature.\r\nTherefore remember well that in treatynge the causes of this disease, I\r\nsayed that this sweate chauncethe cōmonly in theim of the mydde age and\r\nbeste luste, the infection hauyng a certein concordance, or conuenience\r\nwith the corrupte spirites of theim more then others. Knowe agayne that\r\nnature is weke, ij. waies, either in the selfe, or by the annoiance of\r\nan other. In the selfe, by wante of strength consumed by sicknes or\r\nother wise. By annoiaunce of an other, when nature is so ouerlaid with\r\nthe quantitie of euill humours that it can not stirre. Betwene thes two\r\nset youre witte, and se whether the persō be lustye or sickly. If he\r\nbe lustye, vnderstande that the sweat doth not stoppe for wekenes of\r\nnature in it selfe. Then of necessitie it must be for some of thother\r\ncauses. But for whiche, thus knowe. Consider whether the lusty person\r\nwere in foretyme geuen to moche drynkyng, eatyng and rauenyng, to moch\r\nease, to no exercise or bathinges in his helth, or no. If all these you\r\nfinde in him, knowe that bothe nature is wekened by the annoiance of\r\nthe humoures, and that the skinne is stopped, and the humoure grosse,\r\nand that for thys the sweate is letted. If you finde onely some of\r\nthese, and that rauenynge, annoiance is the cause. If want of exercise\r\nor bathinges, stoppinges of the pores and closenesse, or grosenes of\r\nhumours, or bothe, be the cause of not sweatying. On the othersyde, if\r\nthe persō be sickely, it is easely knowē that his wekenes consisteth in\r\nnature the self. And for so moche as weke folkes and sicke shal also\r\nby other causes not sweate, consider if in his sickenes he hath swette\r\nmoche or no, or hath bē disposed to it and coulde not. If he neither\r\nhath swette, nor coulde sweat disposed, knowe that closenes of the\r\nskinne, and grosenes of the humour is the cause. Therfore euery thing\r\nin his kynde muste be remedied, Wekenes of nature, by drinkes prouokyng\r\nsweate: closenes, & grosenes, by rubbynge, as I said. But be ware\r\nneither to rubbe or geue drinkes, excepte you see cause as beforesayd.\r\nFor other wise, the one hindrethe nature, and thother letteth out the\r\nspirites & wasteth y^e strength. Therefore accordyngly, if rubbe you\r\nmust, geue to the sicke in to their beddes a newe and somewhat harde\r\nkerchefe, well warmed but not hote, and bydde theim rubbe all their\r\nbodies ouer therewith vnder the clothes, neither to moche neither to\r\nlitle, nor to harde or to softe, but meanely betwene, takyng you hede\r\nwhiche be aboute them, that by stirrynge their armes they raise not\r\nthe clothes to let in the ayer. This done, if case so require, geue\r\nthē a good draught of hote possette ale made of swiete milke turned\r\nwith vinegre, in a quarte wherof percely, and sage, of eche haulfe one\r\nlitle handfull hath been sodden, wyth iii. sliftes of rosemary, ii.\r\nfenel rootes cutte, and a fewe hole maces. Alwaies remembrynge here,\r\nas in other places of this boke, to heate the herbes in a peuter dishe\r\nbefore the fyre, or washe theim in hote water, before you putte them\r\nin to the posset ale, and that you putte their to no colde herbes\r\nat any tyme durynge the hole fitte. Or geue theim posset ale hote\r\nwith rosemary, dittane, & germander. Or baie beries, anise seades, &\r\ncalamintes with claret wine sodden and dronke warme. Or white wine with\r\nhore and wilde tansy growen in medes sodden therin, and ii. d. weight\r\nof good triacle, dronke hote, or in y^e stede of that, wilde tanesy,\r\nmogwort or feuerfue. These prouoke sweat, may easely be hadde, & be\r\nmetest for thē which haue al y^e causes beforesayde of lettyng thesame.\r\nBut specially if for colde and grose humoures, or for closenes of the\r\nskinne, the sweate commethe not furthe. If with one draught they sweate\r\nnot, geue theim one other, or ij. successiuely, after halfe one houre\r\nbetwene, and encrease the clothes, first a litle aboue the meane,\r\nafter, more or lesse as the cause requireth, & make a litle fire in the\r\nchamber of clene woode, as ashe & oke, with the perfume of bdellium: or\r\nswiet woode, as Juniper, fyrre, or pine, by theimselues: remembrynge\r\nto withdrawe the fire, when they sweat fully, and the clothes aboue\r\nthe meane, by litle and litle as you laide theim on, when they firste\r\ncomplaine of faintyng. And after xii. or xiiii. houres, some also of\r\nthe meane, but one after an other by halfe one houre successiuely with\r\ndiscrecion, alwaies not lokyng so moche to the quantitie of the sweat,\r\nas what the sicke may saufely beare. And in suche case of faintynge,\r\nsuffer competent open aier to come into the chamber, if the same and\r\nthe wether be hote, for smoderynge the pacient, by suche windowes as\r\nthe wynde liethe not in, nor openeth to the south. Put to their noses\r\nto smell vinegre and rose water in an handkercher, not touchynge theim\r\nthere with so nighe as maye be. Cause theim to lie on their right side,\r\nand bowe theim selues forward, call theim by their names, and beate\r\ntheim with a rosemary braunche, or some other swete like thynge. In the\r\nstede of posset ale, they whiche be troubled with gowtes, dropsies,\r\nreumes, or suche other moiste euill diseases, chauncing to sweat, may\r\ndrinke a good draught of the stronger drinke of _Guaiacum_ so hote as\r\nthey can, for the lyke effecte, as also others may, not hauynge these\r\ndeseases, if it be so redy to theim as the other. After they ones sweat\r\nfully, myne aduise is not to geue any more posset ale, but clarified\r\nale with suger, duryng the hole fitte, neither vnreasonably, nor so\r\nofte as they call for it, neither yet pinchyng theym to moche when they\r\nhaue nede, alwayes takynge hede not to putte any colde thynge in their\r\nmouthe to cole and moiste them with, nor any colde water, rose water,\r\nor colde vinegre to their face duryng the sweat and one daie after\r\nat the leaste, but alwaies vse warmeth accordynge to nature, neuer\r\ncontrariyng thesame so nighe as may be. If they raue or be phrenetike,\r\nputte to their nose thesame odour of rose water & vinegre, to lette the\r\nvapoures from the headde. If they slepe, vse theim as in the case of\r\nfaintyng I said, with betyng theim and callynge theim, pullyng theim\r\nby the eares, nose, or here, suffering them in no wise to slepe vntil\r\nsuche tyme as they haue no luste to slepe, except to a learned mā in\r\nphisicke the case appere to beare the contrary. For otherwise the\r\nvenime in slepe continually runneth inward to y^e hart. The contrary\r\nhereof we muste alwaies intende, in prouokyng it outwarde by all meanes\r\nduryng the fitte, whyche so longe lasteth in burnynge and sweatyng, as\r\nthe matter thereof hath any fyrie or apte partes therfore. For as great\r\n& strong wine, ale, or bere, so longe do burne as there is matter in\r\ntheim apte to be burned, and then cesse when that whiche remainethe\r\nis come againe to hys firste nature: that is, to suche water clere &\r\nvnsauery, as either the bruer receiued of the riuer, or vine of the\r\nearth: euen so the body so longe continuethe burnynge and sweatynge,\r\nas their is matter apte therefore in the spirites, and then leaueth,\r\nwhen the corrupcion taken of the finest of the euill blode is consumed,\r\nand the spirites lefte pure and cleane as they were before the tyme of\r\ntheir corruption.\r\n\r\nThis done, and the body by sufficient sweate discharged of the venime,\r\nthe persone is saulfe. But if he by vnrulines & brekyng his sweate,\r\nsweateth not sufficiently, thē he is in daunger of death by y^t venime\r\nthat doth remaine, or at the leaste to sweat ones againe or oftener, as\r\nmany hath done, fallynge in thrise, sixe tymes, yea, xii. tymes some.\r\nIf sufficiently the sweate be come, you shal know by the lightnes &\r\ncherefulnes of the body, & lanckenes in all partes, by the continuall\r\nsweatyng the hole daie and out of all partes, whyche be the beste and\r\nholsome sweates. The other which come but by tymes and onely in certein\r\npartes, or broken, be not sufficient nor good, but very euill, of\r\nwhose insufficiency, ij. notes learne: a swellyng in y^e partes with\r\na blackenes, & a tinglyng or prickyng in the same. Suche I aduise to\r\nappointe theim selues to sweat againe to ridde their bodies of that\r\nremaineth, & abide it out vntill they fele their bodies lanke & light,\r\nand to moue the sweat as before I said, if thesame come not kyndly\r\nby the selfe. If they cānot forbeare meate during y^e space of their\r\nfitte, and faste out their xxiiij. houres, without danger, geue theim a\r\nlitle of an alebrie onely, or of a thinne caudel of an egge sodden with\r\none hole mace or ij. If they be forced by nature to ease them selues\r\nin the meane time, let them do it rather in warme shetes put into them\r\nclosely, then to arise. After they haue thus fully swette, conuey\r\nclosely warme clothes into theyre beddes, and bid them wipe themselues\r\nthere with in al partes curiouslye: and be ware that no ayer entre into\r\ntheire open bodies (and speciallye their arme holes, the openest &\r\nrarest parte therof) to let the issue of that whych doeth remaine. The\r\nlyke may be done in the reste of their fitte, with lyke warenes, for\r\nthat clenlinesse comfortethe nature, and relieueth the pacient. If in\r\nduringe oute the foure and twentye houres there be thought daungiere\r\nof death without remouing, rather warme well the other side of the\r\nbedde, and wil hym to remoue himself into it, thē to take him vp &\r\nremoue hym to an other bed, which in no case mai be done. For better\r\nis a doubtful ware hope, then a certeine auentured death. The foure\r\nand twenty houres passed duly, they may putte on theire clothes warme,\r\naryse, and refresshe theym selues with a cawdle of an egge swietelye\r\nmade, or such other meates and sauces reasonably and smally taken, as\r\nbefore I mencioned. And if their strength be sore wasted, let theym\r\nsmelle to an old swiet apple (as Aristotle did by his reporte in the\r\nboke _de pomo_) or hotte new bread, as _Democritus_ did, by the record\r\nof _Laertius_ in his life, either by it self alone, or dipped in wel\r\nsmelling wyne, as Maluesey or Muscadelle, & sprinckled with the pouder\r\nof mintes. Orenges also and Lemones, or suche muske balles as I before\r\ndescribed, be thinges mete for this purpose. For as I saied in my ij.\r\nlitle bokes in Latine _de medendi methodo_, of deuise to cure diseases,\r\nthere is no thinge more comfortable to the spirites then good and swiet\r\nodoures. On this wise aduised how to order your selues in al the time\r\nof the fitte, now this remaineth, to exhorte you not to go out of your\r\nhouses for iij. dayes, or ij. at the least after the fitte passed, and\r\nthen wiselye, warely, and not except in a faire bright daye, for feare\r\nof swouning after great emptinesse, and vnwont ayer, or for forcyng\r\nnature by soubdaine strikyng in of thesame aier, colde, or euil, in\r\nto the open body. For nature so forced, maketh often tymes a sore and\r\nsoubdaine fluxe, as wel after auoidaunce of these humores by sweate,\r\n(as was this yere well sene in many persones in diuerse contries of\r\nEnglande for none other cause) as of others by purgation.\r\n\r\nThus I haue declared the begynning, name, nature, accidentes, signes,\r\ncauses, preseruations, and cures naturall of this disease the sweatynge\r\nsickenes, English _Ephemera_, or pestilent sweate, so shortly & plainly\r\nas I could for y^e cōmune saufty of my good countrimen, help, relieue,\r\n& defence of thesame against y^e soubdaine assaultes of the disease,\r\n& to satisfie the honeste requeste of my louynge frendes and gentleὣ\r\nacquaintance. If other causes ther be supernatural, theim I leue to the\r\ndiuines to serche, and the diseases thereof to cure, as a matter with\r\nout the compasse of my facultie.\r\n\r\n\r\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|                             FOOTNOTES:                               |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [348] The author seems to me here to allude to what Sydenham calls   |\r\n| the “constitutio epidemica,” as if he would say, “The epidemic       |\r\n| constitution as it exists at any one time, is but a step,” &c.       |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [349] _Grafton_, Vol. II. pp. 147. 155.                              |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [350] _Hall_, p. 425.                                                |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [351] For suddenlie a deadlie burning sweat so assailed their        |\r\n| bodies and distempered their blood with a most ardent heat, that     |\r\n| _scarce one amongst an hundred_ that sickened did escape with life;  |\r\n| for all in maner as soone as the sweat tooke them, or within a       |\r\n| short time after, yeelded the ghost. _Holinshed_, Vol. III. p. 482.  |\r\n| _Godwin_, p. 98. _Polydor._ _Vergilius_, L.

The date of the year of this letter from    |\r\n| Sir _Thomas More_ to _Erasmus_, 1520, is clearly erroneous, as       |\r\n| is that of many other letters in this collection, for at that        |\r\n| time the Sweating Sickness did not prevail in London; it is          |\r\n| also sufficiently well known from other researches (Biographie       |\r\n| Universelle—General Biographical Dictionary), that Ammonius died     |\r\n| in 1517. The date of the month, however, 19th August, seems to be    |\r\n| correct. _Sprengel_ has, in consequence of this false date of the    |\r\n| year, been misled to assume a specific epidemic Sweating Sickness    |\r\n| as having taken place in the year 1520, (Book II. p. 686,) which is  |\r\n| wholly unconfirmed.                                                  |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [449] _Grafton_, p. 294, is very detailed.

Et quand venoit au guerir, ils iettoient grande      |\r\n| effusion de sang par la bouche, le nez et le fondement, _sans        |\r\n| qu’aucun médecin peust iuger dont procedoit ce mal, sinon d’une      |\r\n| generale contagion de l’air, dont la cause leur estoit cachée_.      |\r\n| Cette maladie fut appellée le _Tac_: et tel autrefois a souhaité     |\r\n| par risée ou imprecation le mal du Tac à son compagnon, qui ne       |\r\n| sçavoit pas que c’estoit.—L’an 1427, vers la S.

Après ce venoit une toux si mauvaise, que quand   |\r\n| on estoit au Sermon, on ne pouvoit entendre ce que le Sermonateur    |\r\n| disoit par la grande noise des tousseurs. Item elle eust une très    |\r\n| forte durée jusques après la Toussaincts (1. Nov.) bien quinze       |\r\n| iours ou plus.

In the        |\r\n| influenza of 1580, violent perspiration was occasionally observed,   |\r\n| so that some physicians thought that the English sweating sickness   |\r\n| was about to return, just as in the Gröninger intermittent (1826),   |\r\n| and in the cholera of 1831, without any knowledge on the subject,    |\r\n| they talked of the Black Death.—_Schneider_, L.

This noble sect did such great cures, that they got        |\r\n| themselves a perpetual name; for like as Thessalus’ sect were        |\r\n| called Thessalions, so was this noble rabblement, for their          |\r\n| notorious cures, called dog-leaches; for in two dressings they       |\r\n| did commonly make their cures whole and sound for ever, so that      |\r\n| they neither felt heat nor cold, nor no manner of pain after. But    |\r\n| when the Duke of Norfolk, who was then general, understood how       |\r\n| the people did die, and that of small wounds, he sent for me and     |\r\n| certain other surgeons, commanding us to make search how these       |\r\n| men came to their death, whether it were by the grievousness of      |\r\n| their wounds, or by the lack of knowledge of the surgeons, and we,   |\r\n| according to our commandment, made search through all the camp, and  |\r\n| found many of the same good fellows which took upon them the names   |\r\n| of surgeons, not only the names, but the wages also. We asking of    |\r\n| them whether they were surgeons or no, they said they were; we       |\r\n| demanded with whom they were brought up, and they, with shameless    |\r\n| faces, would answer, either with one cunning man, or another, which  |\r\n| was dead. Then we demanded of them what chirurgery stuff they had    |\r\n| to cure men withal; and they would show us a pot or a box, which     |\r\n| they had in a budget, wherein was such trumpery as they did use      |\r\n| to grease horses’ heels withal, and laid upon scabbed horses’        |\r\n| backs, with verval and such like. And others that were cobblers and  |\r\n| tinkers, they used shoemakers’ wax, with the rust of old pans, and   |\r\n| made therewithal a noble salve, as they did term it. But in the      |\r\n| end this worthy rabblement was committed to the Marshalsea, and      |\r\n| threatened by the Duke’s Grace to be hanged for their worthy deeds,  |\r\n| except they would declare the truth, what they were and of what      |\r\n| occupations, and in the end they did confess, as I have declared to  |\r\n| you before.”                                                         |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| In another place Gale says, “I have, myself, in the time of King     |\r\n| Henry VIII., holpe to furnish out of London, in one year, which      |\r\n| served by sea and land, three score and twelve surgeons, which were  |\r\n| good workmen, and well able to serve, and all English men. At this   |\r\n| present day there are not thirty-four, of all the whole company, of  |\r\n| Englishmen, and yet the most part of them be in noblemen’s service,  |\r\n| so that if we should have need, I do not know where to find twelve   |\r\n| sufficient men. What do I say? sufficient men: nay, I would there    |\r\n| were ten amongst all the company, worthy to be called surgeons.”     |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [650] _Klemzen_, p. 255.                                             |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [651] Part I. cap. 8.                                                |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [652] _Gruner_, Script, p. 11.                                       |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [653] “Vix malevolorum _cachinnos_ morsusque præteriit.”             |\r\n| _Schiller_, Epist. nuncupator. the title which _Gruner_, Script. p.  |\r\n| 12, gives to the original work, still existing in the library at     |\r\n| Strasburg, and a Latin extract from it. _Gratoroli_, fol. 39.        |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [654] See the Catalogue in the Appendix, “Ein Regiment,” &c.         |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [655] Any kind of weak beer with the chill off.

A Purpura urticata—elevated rose-like spots, or papulæ of         |\r\n| smaller circumference: it was very favourable, and sometimes passed  |\r\n| off without fever. 2. Spots consisting of very small miliary         |\r\n| vesicles and pustules which ran into each other: less favourable.    |\r\n| 3. Small hemispherical pimples, from the size of a mustard seed      |\r\n| to that of a corn of maize. They were surmounted by a white point    |\r\n| before they died away, and the large kind became converted into      |\r\n| pustules, filled with matter or greyish semitransparent phlyctænæ,   |\r\n| with red inflamed bases. This form was the commonest, and extended,  |\r\n| mixed with the others, over the whole surface, especially the        |\r\n| trunk. 4. An exanthem resembling flea-bites, of a bright red, with   |\r\n| a small grey miliary vesicle in the middle, almost invisible,        |\r\n| except through a lens: this form was the worst. _Pujol_, Œuvres      |\r\n| diverses de Médecine Pratique, 4 vols. _Castres_, 1801. 8vo.         |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [854] _Foderé_, III. p. 222.                                         |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [855] On this point see _Allioni_, who drew his classical            |\r\n| description of miliary fever from the Piedmont epidemics.            |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n| [856] _Bellot_, An febri putridæ, Picardis Suette dictæ sudorifera?  |\r\n| Diss. præs. _Ott.
