The king, the statesman, the\r\nhero, the saintly founder of a religion, the philosopher that guides\r\nthe course of human thought, and the scientist who gives us a greater\r\ncommand of nature, are the men whom we honor as the ministers of\r\ndestiny.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of science, we accord the highest rank to that which\r\ngives the greatest comprehension of the world as it is--of its past\r\nand of its future. Geology and astronomy are the sciences which reach\r\nout into the illimitable alike in the present and past. Biology will\r\ndo the same for the world of life when biology is completed by a\r\nknowledge of the centre of all life, the brain. But in its present\r\nacephalous condition it is but a fragment of science--a headless\r\ncorpse, unfit to rank among complete sciences. Theology claims the\r\nhighest rank of all, but based as it has been on the conceptions\r\ncurrent in the dark ages, it has become, in the light of modern\r\nscience, a crumbling ruin. Does psychometry compare with astronomy and\r\ngeology in its scientific rank, or does it compare with the acephalous\r\nbiology, which occupies all medical colleges?\r\n\r\nIt compares with neither. Like astronomy, it borders on the limitless;\r\nlike geology, it reaches into the vast, undefined past; and like\r\nbiology, it comprehends all life science; but unlike each, it has no\r\nlimitation to any sphere. It is equally at home with living forms and\r\nwith dead matter--equally at home in the humbler spheres of human life\r\nand human infirmity, and in the higher spheres of the spirit world,\r\nwhich we call heaven. It grasps all of biology, all of history, all of\r\ngeology and astronomy, and far more than telescopes have revealed. It\r\nhas no parallel in any science, for sciences are limited and defined\r\nin their scope, while psychometry is unlimited, transcending far all\r\nthat collegians have called science, and all that they have deemed the\r\nlimits of human capacities, for in psychometry the divinity in man\r\nbecomes apparent, and the intellectual mastery of all things lifts\r\nhuman life to a higher plane than it has ever known before.\r\n\r\nPsychometry is therefore in its nature and scope not classifiable\r\namong the sciences, since it reaches out above and beyond all, in a\r\nhigher and broader sphere, and hence may truly be called the Divine\r\nscience, for it is the expression of the Divine element in man.\r\nWherein is Divine above human knowledge? And wherein is human above\r\nanimal knowledge and understanding? The superiority in each case\r\nconsists in a deeper and more interior comprehension of that which is,\r\nwhich realizes in the present the potentiality of the future, enabling\r\nus to act for future results and accomplish whatever is possible to\r\nour powers. That forecast, that comprehension through the present of\r\nthat which is to be, constitutes foresight,--the essential element of\r\nwisdom; and in its grander manifestations it appears as prophecy.\r\nProphecy, then, is the noblest aspect of psychometry; and if this\r\nprophetic power can be cultivated to its maximum possibilities, there\r\nis no reason why it should not become the guiding power of each\r\nindividual life, and the guiding power for the destiny of nations.\r\nMoreover, in its prophetic role its superiority of rank is manifest,\r\nsince it is then the instructor of all hearers,--the revealer of that\r\nin which they readily confess their ignorance.\r\n\r\nHence it was that St. Paul especially recommended the cultivation of\r\nprophecy as the most sacred and Divine of all religious exercises,\r\nsaying, in 1 Corinthians xiv. 21-25: \"If therefore the whole church be\r\ncome together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there\r\ncome in those who are unlearned or unbelievers, will they not say ye\r\nare mad? But _if all prophesy_, and there come in one that believeth\r\nnot, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:\r\nand thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling\r\ndown on his face, he will worship God, and report that God is in you\r\nof a truth.\" This is a description of a congregation in which all are\r\ndeveloped up to a psychometric and spiritual condition in which the\r\ntruths of religion and the ministry of angels may have full power.\r\n\r\nWherever the highest order of religious sentiment is in active\r\noperation, prophecy becomes one of its results. It was so in Jewish\r\nhistory, and has been so in many eventful periods since.\r\n\r\nGeorge Fox had the most exalted religious sentiment of his time, and\r\nhe had an eminently prophetic mind. All nations have had prophetic\r\nminds and well-attested prophecies. Egypt and India, Greece, Rome,\r\nFrance, England, and America, have their recorded prophecies, and in\r\nthe height of ancient civilization prophecy commanded sufficient\r\nrespect to influence the course of public events. Cicero expressed the\r\ngeneral intelligence of the ancients in recognizing prophecy as a\r\npower of the human soul.\r\n\r\nModern materialism has ignored all this, and one of the noblest works\r\nto-day for a man of genius whose mind is sufficiently vigorous to\r\nthrow off the trammels of collegiate ignorance and fashionable\r\nconservatism, would be to produce a volume upon prophecy, in which its\r\nvast historic development should be sketched.\r\n\r\nThe limitations of the JOURNAL OF MAN do not permit me to introduce\r\nthis historic matter which would be sufficient to exclude everything\r\nelse from its pages, and I would merely refer to an almost forgotten\r\nexample of the intuitive and prescient faculty connected with the\r\nintroduction of Universalism into this country.\r\n\r\nA worthy and pious farmer on the seacoast of Delaware, named Potter,\r\nbuilt a church at his own expense, but having an advanced idea of the\r\nDivine benevolence, he could never find any preacher whose doctrines\r\nsuited him. Nevertheless he was profoundly convinced that such a\r\npreacher would be sent to realize his hopes, and was not discouraged\r\nby the disbelief of his neighbors. His anticipation was strangely\r\nfulfilled. Rev. John Murray, almost crazed by the death of his wife,\r\nsailed from England for America in 1770, intending to abandon the\r\npulpit entirely. The vessel put in at Philadelphia instead of New\r\nYork, and as the stage for New York had left, Mr. Murray concluded to\r\nremain on the vessel and go to New York that way. But on the voyage\r\nthey got lost in the fog, and got into Cranberry Inlet in a dangerous\r\nposition. They went ashore, being out of provisions, and found a\r\ncountry tavern. Mr. Murray strolled along the coast, intending to get\r\nfish for the crew, and fell into company with Farmer Potter, who had a\r\nsupply, and who at once told him, to his astonishment, that he was\r\nglad to meet him, and had been looking for him a long time. Potter\r\ndecided at once that this was the minister he had been looking for,\r\nand of whom he had often spoken when telling his neighbors, \"God will\r\nsend me a preacher of a very different stamp from those who have\r\nheretofore preached in my house; that God who has put it into my heart\r\nto build this house will send one who shall deliver to me His own\r\ntruth, who shall speak of Jesus Christ and His salvation.\" Potter\r\nbriefly sketched his own life and said:\r\n\r\n\"The moment I beheld your vessel on shore, it seemed as if a voice had\r\nsuddenly sounded in my ears: 'There, Potter, in that vessel cast away\r\non that shore is the preacher you have been so long expecting.' I\r\nheard the voice and I believed the report; and when you came up to my\r\ndoor and asked for the fish, the same voice seemed to repeat, 'Potter,\r\nthis is the man, this is the person whom I have sent to preach in your\r\nhouse.'\"\r\n\r\nMurray says: \"I was astonished, immeasurably astonished at Mr.\r\nPotter's narrative, but yet I had not the smallest idea that it could\r\never be realized. I requested to know what he could discover in my\r\nappearance which could lead him to mistake me for a preacher.\" \"What,\"\r\nsaid he, \"could I discover when you were in the vessel that could\r\ninduce this conclusion? No sir, it is not what I saw or see, but what\r\nI feel, which produces in my mind a full conviction.\" \"But, my dear\r\nsir, you are deceived, indeed you are deceived. I shall never preach\r\nin this place nor anywhere else.\"\r\n\r\nPotter maintained that he had preached and that he would preach in his\r\nchurch, and that the wind would not allow him to leave until he had.\r\nTo shorten the story, Murray at last yielded and preached in that\r\nchurch, of which we have a picture in his biography. He had a great\r\nfear of giving out the doctrine of universal salvation, expecting\r\nuniversal denunciation of himself by the clergy and their followers,\r\nbut he went on from this beginning and established Universalism in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nIn this instance it is evident that Potter was of a spiritual\r\ntemperament, and was indebted to a spirit influence for his\r\nimpressions and convictions. But whatever is possible to the\r\ndisembodied spirit in the intellectual way is also possible to the\r\nembodied spirit which has not lost its material body, if the interior\r\nfaculties are well developed and prophecy does not require supernal\r\naid. In innumerable cases mesmeric subjects, in their somniloquent\r\ncondition, have made most accurate predictions in reference to their\r\nown cases and others, which have been accurately verified. There is\r\nprobably no good clairvoyant physician who has not often made\r\nsuccessful predictions concerning patients.\r\n\r\nIn the daily practice of psychometry, Mrs. Buchanan, of whose powers\r\nthe \"Manual of Psychometry\" gives a fair idea, is accustomed in\r\nspeaking of the present to feel impressions of the past and the\r\nfuture. In reference to public men she has spoken in advance of their\r\nelection or defeat, their policy and their death. She spoke\r\nprophetically of the election of Cleveland and the defeat of Blaine,\r\nof the deaths of Disraeli and Garibaldi, of the career of Gladstone\r\nand his becoming \"the best friend of Ireland;\" and when Ireland was\r\nbelieved to be on the brink of a bloody revolution or rebellion, she\r\nannounced that no such outbreak would occur, but that at the end of\r\ntwo years Ireland would be pacified and quiet. At the end of two years\r\nthis was verified, for the magistrates commented on the fact at that\r\ntime that there were fewer crimes of violence before them than had\r\nbeen customary.\r\n\r\nI have learned to rely on this prescience, and in reference to public\r\nmen and public affairs, when they interested me, have satisfied my\r\ncuriosity by the psychometric method.\r\n\r\nFor twelve months past the newspaper press and the statesmen of Europe\r\nand America have been continually agitated by apprehensions of a great\r\nEuropean war, and have made numerous estimates of the power of\r\nbelligerents and the result of the contest. France and Germany have\r\nbeen expected to engage in a fatal conflict, and even a noted public\r\nmedium has fallen in with these ideas and predicted a coming war this\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nI have kept the record of public opinion, and from time to time have\r\ninvoked the aid of psychometry, which has dissipated every fear and\r\ncontradicted all the pessimistic notions of politicians and newspaper\r\ncorrespondents down to the present time.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of January I recorded the psychometric impressions, again\r\nin February, and again on the 11th of March. The psychometer answers\r\nquestions or discusses subjects by impression alone, not knowing what\r\nis under her hand, but expressing what arises in her mind. The first\r\nimpression, January 26, was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"It looks misty, but the finale looks bright. The result of this,\r\nwhatever it is, will be a grand success or achievement--good will\r\nresult. There is a dissatisfaction or rivalry on a very large\r\nscale--very momentous--is it war? There is agitation and blustering.\"\r\n\r\n_Q._--How will it be in the summer?\r\n\r\n\"There will not be war. There is a growing contention, like growling,\r\nangry dogs; they may keep up growling for a year, but it will be\r\nnothing; there will be good coming out of it--a better understanding;\r\nthis experience will elevate the views of the people; they will see\r\nthe folly, and not be so belligerent. _There will be no war_ this\r\nsummer.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was the drift of opinion, however, as shown by the press? The\r\ncorrespondent of the New York _Sun_ said: \"Everybody talks of war as a\r\nsure thing which must soon appear somewhere. The work of getting ready\r\nfor the fray, of which I have often sent details, goes steadily on.\"\r\nM. Thibaudin \"hopes for peace, as do all other diplomats trained and\r\nadmired for their ability to say what they don't think; and finally he\r\nannounces that France is ready to fight whenever the time comes.\"\r\nJanuary 29 he writes: \"The _Daily News_ war scare which shook us up\r\nearly in the week seems not to have exhausted its disquieting\r\ninfluence yet.\" \"France and Germany are looked upon as certain to lead\r\noff the ball, and Germany, it is generally thought, will be found at\r\nthe head of the set and take the initiative. Preparations for a big\r\nfight continue in every direction.\" \"Russia, if we can believe the\r\ntales from that unreliable country, is quietly making preparations on\r\na tremendous scale to have her paw fall heavily on somebody.\"\r\n\r\nThe French _Revue des Deux Mondes_ said about this time that a war\r\nbetween France and Germany would almost inevitably lead to a general\r\nEuropean war, on a scale such as the world has never before seen.\r\n\r\nThe Russian _Viedomosti_ of February 5 said: \"No compromise is\r\npossible between Russia and Austria concerning Eastern affairs,\r\nwithout detriment to Russia and the Eastern races. German intervention\r\nis useless, and will only create hostility between Russia and\r\nGermany.\"\r\n\r\nThe Boston _Herald_ correspondent of February 5, said of France and\r\nGermany: \"Now both are counted as among the most civilized and most\r\nhumanitarian on the face of the globe, and yet the _certainty of war_\r\nbetween the two hereditary enemies on either side of the Rhine is _as\r\ncertain as anything can be_. When it comes, be it sooner or later, one\r\nof the two adversaries is inevitably condemned, if not to total\r\nannihilation, at least to such a crushing punishment that for many\r\nlong years the defeated power will be little more than a geographical\r\nexpression on modern maps.\" His letter concluded with an elaborate\r\nstatement of the military resources and condition of the two nations,\r\nwhich approximate an equality in the aggregate.\r\n\r\nA Paris dispatch of the same date said that \"Prince Bismarck has\r\nsucceeded in establishing a coalition between Austria, England, and\r\nItaly against Russia. Germany will join the coalition if France\r\nsupports Russia.\"\r\n\r\nThe New York _Sun_ of February 7, said: \"We suppose there is no\r\nsubject which just now is more earnestly discussed among intelligent\r\nAmericans than the probable result of the war between France and\r\nGermany which is believed to be approaching. France ought by this time\r\nto have outstripped her enemy in point of military efficiency. She has\r\nlaid out since 1871 nearly twice as much on her permanent armament,\r\nand she devotes nearly twice as much to the current military expenses\r\nof each year. She has maintained a larger peace establishment, and she\r\nshould have it in her power to bring to the field a larger number of\r\nsoldiers who have served under the colors.\"\r\n\r\nFebruary 10 the Paris correspondent of the Berlin _Post_ said that\r\nGeneral Boulanger was growing in popularity, and \"is regarded by the\r\nmasses as the long-expected liberator. The whole country is anxious\r\nfor _revanche_ [revenge], and is arming silently, but with the evident\r\nbelief that the hour is coming.\" To add to the growing hostility, the\r\n_Post_ quotes from the Paris _Figaro_ an article imputing the grossest\r\nimmorality to German women.\r\n\r\nAt the same date, the Buda Pesth _Journal_ urged Austria to attack\r\nRussia before the latter has completed her preparations on the lower\r\nDanube. It said: \"_War is inevitable_, and it is better to begin\r\nfighting before the Balkan states have been Russianized.\"\r\n\r\nSenor Castillo, the Spanish minister of the interior, said that Spain\r\nhad taken steps to augment her defences and protect her colonies, in\r\nview of the possible European war.\r\n\r\nFebruary 12 a despatch to the London _News_ from St. Petersburg said:\r\n\"Ominous fears of a European war prevail here. It is announced that\r\nGerman colonists in the Caucasus have been notified to hold themselves\r\nin readiness to return to Germany and join the reserves.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same date the _North German Gazette_ said that since General\r\nBoulanger had assumed charge of the French war office not a day had\r\npassed without measures being taken to augment the offensive strength\r\nof the army, and there were constant movements of troops upon the\r\nfrontiers.\r\n\r\nFebruary 19 the news was still more alarming at Berlin. Work was going\r\non night and day on the fortifications at Verdun and Belfort. \"All\r\ncommerce has been suspended at Metz, excepting in food. The\r\ninhabitants are storing their houses from cellar to garret.\" A Russian\r\npaper of that date said, \"Existing circumstances admit of no delay.\"\r\n\r\nAt Vienna, February 18, it was announced that \"a semi-official letter\r\nfrom St. Petersburg represents that Russia is waiting for a\r\nFranco-German conflict, _which she considers inevitable_, to realize\r\nher own Balkan projects. Russia would consider it to be to her own\r\ninterest not to allow Germany to be victorious.\"\r\n\r\nFebruary 19 Senator Beck at Washington referred to an extract from a\r\nlate speech of Count von Moltke before the German Reichstag, to show\r\nthat _war is inevitable_.\r\n\r\nFebruary 27 the London despatch to the _Boston Herald_ said: \"Within\r\nthe last forty-eight hours confidence in the maintenance of peace has\r\nvisibly lessened.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the same time in Russian government circles the conviction was\r\nsaid to be gaining ground that a Franco-German war was inevitable, and\r\nthat it would be for the interest of Russia to save France from\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nMarch 6 the _North German Gazette_ said that the Alsace elections had\r\nstrengthened the war party in France. War seems to have been the\r\ngeneral anticipation of military men. General Wolseley (February 26)\r\nis reported to have said: \"I feel sure that a vast, appalling war is\r\ncertainly in the near future; but this, indeed, everybody may be said\r\nto know.\"\r\n\r\nBut \"everybody\" is as liable to be mistaken on questions of futurity\r\nas on questions of philosophy and religion, on which the multitude\r\ncalled \"everybody\" has been largely mistaken ever since the earliest\r\nperiods known to history. \"Everybody\" is generally pessimistic, apt to\r\nbe superstitious, and never philosophic. A single good psychometric\r\nperception is worth much more than Mr. Everybody's opinion, whether\r\nupon national policy, personal character, historical truth, or medical\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThe psychometric opinion is the opposite of that of General Wolseley\r\nand Senator Beck, for the psychometric soul is in the calm sphere of\r\ntruth, in which the passions have no deceiving power. I have already\r\npublished in the \"Manual of Psychometry\" the prediction of universal\r\npeace at the end of five years from the prophecy, and I now repeat the\r\nstatement that great Franco-German war is but the fantasy of passion\r\nand fear. The last psychometric expression, March 11, confirms the\r\nuniform statements heretofore. Upon the question \"What of the war in\r\nEurope?\" this was the impression:\r\n\r\n\"This seems a question of occurrences. I seem to disagree with other\r\npeople on this question. It does not seem to me that it will occur. If\r\nthere are any prognostications, they are _intensified_. The result\r\nwill not be what is predicted. There is something like a foreshadowing\r\nthat might cause a prediction, but it will pass over. There is a good\r\ndeal of agitation and concern, but nothing will occur this year as\r\napprehended. I feel that it will all subside, and a picture of\r\nbrightness and a clear sky appears. The fire will burn out; the\r\nboiling caldron which sends up steam will be quiet; _a peaceful time\r\nis coming_.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the JOURNAL shall have a little more space, for _it must be\r\nenlarged_, and psychometry is a little better understood, I propose to\r\nestablish a prophetic department, and speak to my readers of coming\r\nevents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(From the _Pall Mall Gazette_, London, Jan. 12.)\r\n\r\nA MODERN MIRACLE WORKER.\r\n\r\nAN INTERVIEW WITH MR. GEORGE MILNER STEPHEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery one knows Sir James Fitzjames Stephen; most people have heard of\r\nMr. Leslie Stephen--the two most distinguished members of the Stephen\r\nfamily resident in this country. The Stephen clan, however, is\r\nwidespread, and there are eminent Stephens scattered all over the\r\nworld. \"Any Stephen,\" said Mr. Froude in his \"Oceanea,\" \"could not\r\nfail to be interesting.\" Sir Alfred Stephen, the deputy governor of\r\nNew South Wales, is declared by Mr. Froude to be regarded as the\r\ngreatest Australian, by nine out of every ten of the people of Sydney.\r\nBut the judicial renown of Fitzjames, the literary fame of Leslie, and\r\nthe colonial reputation of Sir Alfred, all pale their ineffectual\r\nfires before the marvellous claims of George Milner Stephen, across\r\nwhom Mr. Froude stumbled in New Zealand, and who has now turned up\r\nunexpectedly in London. He is, as Mr. Froude said, a very noticeable\r\nperson. In fact, he is a thaumaturgist of the first order. While his\r\nrelatives in the old country have devoted all the energy of their\r\nintellect to demonstrate the absurdity of all the superstitions built\r\nupon any arbitrary interference with the invariable laws of nature,\r\ntheir kinsman George Milner suddenly displays at the antipodes a gift\r\nof healing which, if the veracious records of colonial and American\r\nnewspapers can be relied upon, rivals the most famous exploits of\r\napostolic times. Not, indeed, that George Milner has yet raised the\r\ndead to life. That is beyond his powers. But all the minor marvels,\r\nsuch as making the blind to see, the deaf to hear, the dumb to speak,\r\nand the lame to walk, are accomplished by him in the ordinary course\r\nof his daily practice. Although this miracle-working Stephen is a\r\nphysician whose patients are healed by the touch, he is nevertheless a\r\nphysician practising the healing art like other eminent\r\nauthorities--for the prescribed fee of the ordinary medical\r\npractitioners. The only difference is that whereas the ordinary\r\nphysician attends his patient daily for weeks and sometimes months,\r\nMr. Stephen's course, if a course at all, ends at the latest in three\r\nvisits, and the charges, therefore, are correspondingly low. Two\r\nguineas for consultation fee, one guinea each subsequent visit, or\r\nfour guineas at the outside, are to be regarded as his retaining fee;\r\nbut in those cases--and they are said to constitute a large proportion\r\nof those submitted to him--in which he effects a complete cure he\r\nnaturally expects to be remembered by the grateful patient whom he has\r\nrestored to health. This, however, by the way. In response to an\r\ninvitation to the _Pall Mall Gazette_ office, Mr. George Milner\r\nStephen described to a member of our staff with much detail the nature\r\nof his work. It is a sufficiently marvelous story to arouse attention,\r\neven on the part of the incredulous; and the unbelieving authorities\r\nowe it to the public to institute a series of investigations into\r\ntheir relative's claims, in order that he may either be claimed as the\r\nmaster healer of his age, or summarily prosecuted as a rogue and\r\nvagabond, who is obtaining money under false pretences. It is\r\nmonstrous that a gentleman of his rank and position should be allowed\r\nto go at large, making such enormous claims of quasi-supernatural\r\npowers, without having them promptly brought to the most rigorous of\r\nscientific tests.\r\n\r\nMr. George Milner Stephen is a man of wide and varied culture, of\r\ngreat experience in affairs, and has spent his life in public service\r\nof the most varied kind. Brought up to the bar, he has been a trained\r\nlawyer all his life. He has been acting-governor of South Australia;\r\nhe refused the colonial secretaryship of New Zealand; he has been\r\nofficial draftsman for the colony of Victoria; he has held the balance\r\nof power in more than one colony; and in the colony of New South\r\nWales, at the time when he suddenly discovered his miraculous powers,\r\nhe was leading counsel on circuit, and in receipt of one of the\r\nlargest professional incomes of any lawyer at the antipodes. Nor was\r\nhis training solely colonial. He had repeatedly visited England, and\r\nhad been called to our bar. He takes a keen interest in mineralogical\r\nscience, and in the course of his career has exhibited on more than\r\none occasion great personal bravery and indomitable nerve. That such a\r\nman, so highly connected, so carefully trained, with the intellect of\r\na lawyer and the experience of a statesman, should be in our midst\r\nclaiming to be endowed with the gift of healing spoken of in the New\r\nTestament as vouchsafed to the Christians of apostolic times, is a\r\nportent indeed, and one well worthy of the attentive consideration of\r\nthe most sceptical among us.\r\n\r\n\"It was six and a half years ago,\" said Mr. Stephen in reply to a\r\nquestion, \"that I first discovered that I possessed this gift of\r\nhealing--it was by pure accident. A friend who suffered from deafness\r\njokingly appealed to me to give him back his hearing. I, also in joke,\r\nmade some passes over his head, when to my utter astonishment I\r\ndiscovered that his deafness disappeared. One experiment of this kind\r\nled to another, and in a short time I found myself overwhelmed with\r\npatients of high and low degree, begging me to heal them of their\r\ndiseases. For three months after the discovery of my gift the sudden\r\ninflux of patients who would not be denied left me no time to attend\r\nto my practice; and, willy nilly, I was compelled to give up the law\r\nand take to medicine--if you may call by the name of medicine a\r\nprofession in which no medicine is given.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then do you use no medicine at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"None whatever. The nearest approach to medicine that I ever gave to a\r\npatient is a little magnetized ointment--that is, camphorated lard,\r\nand a little magnetized oil. But it is only occasionally that I use\r\nthese. Neither do I use passes, although it was by the use of passes\r\nthat I first discovered that I possessed this gift.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how do you proceed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Variously. Sometimes I lay my hand upon the part affected; at other\r\ntimes I breathe into the eye, ear, or mouth of the patient. Then,\r\nagain, on other occasions I am able to banish the disease by a mere\r\nword or gesture.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you a mesmerist or a magnetic healer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mesmerist I am not; for mesmerism implies the throwing of the patient\r\ninto a mesmeric sleep. Neither am I a magnetist, properly so called,\r\nfor there is no outgoing of magnetism from my body when I am healing.\r\nThe ordinary magnetist admits that he cannot cure more than four\r\npersons per diem; I have cured as many as thirty, and beyond the\r\nweariness caused by standing, I have been no worse at the end than at\r\nbeginning.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you explain these miracles?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't call them miracles. They are marvels, and I cannot explain\r\nthem. All that I know is that I have gone through the Australian\r\ncolonies, New Zealand, and many of the States in America, and that\r\nwherever I have gone the same effect followed. At my touch, diseases\r\nand defects declared incurable by the first physicians of the faculty,\r\ndisappear. I remember well healing Sir James Martin, the chief justice\r\nof New South Wales. Six years ago he was given up by the doctors and\r\ndeclared to be dying, breathing with great difficulty, and hardly able\r\nto speak without pain. I laid my hand upon his chest, and in a few\r\nminutes all difficulty of breathing disappeared, he was able to speak\r\nfreely, and in a short time he had completely recovered. He resumed\r\nhis seat upon the bench, and remained a hale, active man till his\r\ndeath, which occurred just the other day. That is only one case out of\r\nmany.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I have been the means of healing about 30,000 patients in the\r\nsix and a half years during which I have devoted my time to the work.\r\nOf course many of those patients were suffering from diseases which\r\nmight have been cured by ordinary means. Others were declared to be\r\nincurable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Declared to be incurable by whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"By the chief physicians in the colonies. I have in my\r\npocket\"--producing the papers as he spoke--\"certificates signed by the\r\nwitnesses, attested sometimes by magistrates, and at other times by\r\nministers of religion and colonial ministers, that the person named in\r\nthe certificate has received instantaneous relief by my touch. Here is\r\none in which a person stone-blind from birth received sight when I\r\nblew into his eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then do you cure all diseases?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not. There are many things which I cannot do. I cannot\r\nraise the dead, nor can I restore an arm which has been cut off, a\r\njoint which has been excised, or an eye which has been destroyed. When\r\nthere has been complete destruction of any important organ I cannot\r\neffect a cure; but when destruction of the organ has not been\r\ncomplete, I am frequently able to effect a cure in cases which the\r\nregular faculty have given up as utterly hopeless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take cancer, for instance: can you cure that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have treated some cases with remarkable success; but of course I\r\ncan do so only when the cancer has not eaten too far into the vital\r\norganism of the sufferer. I have treated some thirty cancer cases, the\r\ncure in all being complete. The treatment was that of laying my hands\r\nover the part affected, anointing with a little magnetized ointment,\r\nand sometimes the injection of magnetized oil. Beyond that I do\r\nnothing. I have here records of ten cures of cancer in all parts of\r\nthe body. If you will glance over the accounts, described by the\r\nnewspapers at the time when they occurred, or copies of the\r\ncertificates which I leave with you, you will see that there is almost\r\nno limit to the variety of the cures which I have been able to\r\neffect.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all very well, Mr. Stephen, but you will not make converts by\r\nnewspaper extracts. The point is this: Will you consent to submit your\r\ngift to a practical test?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said he; \"I have already written to Sir Baldwin Leighton,\r\nasking him if he can place me in communication with the governors of\r\ndeaf, dumb, and blind asylums, in order that I may be able to try my\r\npowers upon the patients of those institutions. I am quite satisfied\r\nthat if I am allowed a fair opportunity of trying the effect of my\r\nhealing touch, ten out of every hundred of the inmates of these\r\nasylums will receive their sight, or regain their speech and hearing.\r\nI ask for no payment: I simply request that in these institutions\r\nwhich are maintained by the public charity for the relief of helpless\r\nsufferers, and where, therefore, there can be no collusion or any\r\nsuspicion of trickery or fraud, I should be allowed to lay my hands\r\nupon the eyes or the ears of the inmates. I can do them no harm; and I\r\nam perfectly sure that in at least ten per cent of the cases I shall\r\nbe able to give great if not entire relief.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is all very well; but before you can expect the governors of\r\npublic institutions to allow you to touch their inmates there must be\r\na preliminary illustration of your power. Otherwise they would say\r\njustly that they would be over-run with quacks, all of whom might wish\r\nto try a patent nostrum upon the unfortunate 'inmates of public\r\ninstitutions.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Mr. Stephen, \"I am willing to submit my gift to the\r\nmost stringent test which your scientific sceptics can suggest. I am\r\nwilling to give an exhibition of my power under any test, in the\r\npresence of any picked number of sceptics whom you may nominate, and\r\nyou may bring there half a dozen cases of disease certified by the\r\nfaculty as incurable. Of course you will not bring sufferers whose\r\ncomplaints are manifestly beyond my power to cure. As I said before, I\r\nmake no claim to restore organs that are destroyed, but there is a\r\nsufficiently wide category in the complaints 'that flesh is heir to'\r\nto afford you an ample choice of half a dozen typical incurable cases.\r\nWhen the deaf, dumb, lame, and otherwise suffering persons whom you\r\nwish experimented on have been brought and are in the presence of\r\nthose whom you shall name, I will undertake to effect an immediate\r\nimprovement in the condition of, say, four out of the six. It will\r\nprobably become a complete cure on the second or third visit. I seldom\r\nor never see a patient more than thrice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that seems fair. You have no objection to my publishing this\r\noffer in the _Pall Mall Gazette_?\"\r\n\r\n\"None. I make no profession to any skill. I can only exercise a power\r\nwhich I discovered quite accidentally was vested in me. The limits of\r\nthat I can ascertain only by experience. I am perfectly willing to\r\nhave that power subjected to the severest tests which you can suggest,\r\nand I have no doubt at all, from the invariable experience of the last\r\nsix years, that cures will be effected for which no existing\r\nscientific hypothesis can adequately account.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Gazette_ says in another column:--\"We commend the challenge of\r\nMr. George Milner Stephen, which we publish in another column, to the\r\nspecial attention of all interested in the exposure of popular\r\ndelusion. Here is an educated English barrister of unimpeachable\r\ncharacter, who has rendered no little service to the state, informing\r\nall the faculty that he can heal patients whom they have dismissed as\r\nincurable, by merely breathing on them or touching them. In an\r\nordinary, unknown, vulgar charlatan this challenge might have passed\r\nunnoticed. In the case of the Australian cousin of Mr. Justice\r\nFitzjames Stephen it must be treated more seriously. We invite\r\ncommunications from our scientific readers as to the best way of\r\nputting our visitor to the test.\"\r\n\r\nScores of American healers do similar works to those of Dr. G. M.\r\nStephen, but the fashionable press ignores them because they have not\r\nwealth and social position. The JOURNAL OF MAN will endeavor to do\r\nthem justice. In all such cases, in which the healing power is\r\ninexhaustible, we know that it is replenished from spiritual sources.\r\nDr. Stephen exercises a little policy in not mentioning the spiritual\r\nsource of his power. Godless science and dead sectarianism recoil from\r\nspirit life. No human constitution contains an inexhaustible fountain\r\nof life--the fountain is above, and fortunate are they who can reach\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMAN LONGEVITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe possibility of long life, illustrated in the first number of this\r\nJOURNAL, may easily be corroborated by referring to numerous examples;\r\nbut the fact that the nobler qualities of human nature are the most\r\nefficient promoters of longevity is our most important lesson, and it\r\nis illustrated by the superior longevity of women. He is a misanthrope\r\nwho does not recognize their superior virtue, and he is a poor\r\nstatesman who does not wish to see that virtue imparted to our\r\npolitical life, and who does not recognize the importance of giving to\r\nwoman the most perfect intellectual and industrial education, that she\r\nmay be self supporting. The British census show that there are 948,000\r\nmore women than men in Great Britain. The _St. James Gazette_ says:--\r\n\r\n\"Prof. Humphry of Cambridge has prepared a series of tables which\r\ncontain some interesting information about centenarians. Of 52 persons\r\nwhom he mentions, at least 11--2 males and 9 females--actually\r\nattained the age of 100. Others attained very nearly to the hundred\r\nyears. Only one of the persons reached 108 years, while one died at\r\nthe alleged age of 106. Of the 52 persons, 36 were women and 16 men.\r\nOut of the 36 women 26 had been married, and 11 had borne large\r\nfamilies. Of the 26 who had been wives, 8 had married before they were\r\n20, 1 at 16, and 2 at 17.\r\n\r\n\"Twelve of the fifty-two centenarians were discovered to have been the\r\neldest children of their parents. This fact, adds Dr. Humphry, does\r\nnot agree with popular notions that first children inherit a\r\nfeebleness of constitution, nor with the opinion of racing stables,\r\nwhich is decidedly against the idea that 'firstlings' are to be\r\ndepended on for good performances on the course. The centenarians\r\ngenerally regarded were of spare build. Gout and rheumatism were as a\r\nrule, absent. 'It seems,' says Prof. Humphry, 'that the frame which is\r\ndestined to great age needs no such prophylactics, and engenders none\r\nof the peccant humors for which the finger joints (as in gout) may\r\nfind a vent.'\r\n\r\n\"Of the fifty-two aged people, twenty-four only had no teeth, the\r\naverage number of teeth remaining being four or five. Long hours of\r\nsleep were notable among these old people, the period of repose\r\naveraging nine hours; while out-of-door exercise in plenty and early\r\nrising are to be noted among the factors of a prolonged life. One of\r\nthe centenarians 'drank to excess on festive occasions:' another was a\r\n'free beer drinker,' and 'drank like a fish during his whole life.'\r\nTwelve had been total abstainers for life or nearly so, and mostly all\r\nwere 'small meat eaters.'\"\r\n\r\nThe oldest woman in Austria at this time is Magdalene Ponza, who is\r\n112. \"She was born at Wittingau, Bohemia, in 1775, when Maria Theresa\r\nsat on the Austrian throne. George III. had then been but 15 years\r\nKing of England, Louis XVI. who had ruled a little more than a\r\ntwelvemonth in France, was still in the heyday of power, the\r\nIndependence of the United States of America had not yet been\r\ndeclared, Napoleon and Arthur Wellesley were as yet but six years old.\r\nMagdalene Ponza retains full possession of her mental faculties.\r\nUnfortunately she can only speak the Czech language, and she can\r\nneither read nor write. However, she answers questions briskly enough\r\nthrough the youngest of her surviving grandchildren, herself a woman\r\nof 60. Magdalene Ponza's age is authenticated by the outdoor relief\r\ncertificate of the Viennese Municipality.\"\r\n\r\nOf American centenarians we have a number, some of whom are still\r\nliving. Harrisonville, New Jersey, has two, Michael Potter and\r\nBartholomew Coles. Polly Wilcox of Hope Valley, R. I., celebrated her\r\ncentennial last year; so did Jane Wilcox of Edgecomb, Maine, while she\r\nhad a sister 94, and a daughter 81. Old Auntie Scroggins, of Forsyth\r\nCo., Georgia, is now 104 years old, and is still one of the most\r\neffective shouters of the Methodist Church to which she has belonged\r\n94 years.\r\n\r\nMiss Phebe Harrod, of Newburyport, Mass., celebrated her centennial\r\nlast year. She still takes a lively interest in passing events.\r\n\r\nGrandmother Sarah Drew, at Halifax, celebrated her centennial a year\r\nago. Her constant companion is an old Bible which has been in the Drew\r\nfamily for 250 years.\r\n\r\nMrs. Triphene Bevans, of Danbury, Mass., held a lively centennial\r\nreception in the parlors of the West Street Church, April 14, 1886.\r\nHer health, hearing and speech were good, and her step brisk. She\r\nattributes her age and good health to good habits and allowing nothing\r\nto trouble or worry her. She has always been a strict church member.\r\n\r\nWilliam Waterman, of Oshkosh, Wisconsin, is said to be 109 years old.\r\nIt is said he \"is a Methodist, uses liquor and tobacco, and finds no\r\nfault with the world.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph O'Neal of Barnesville, Georgia, might have been living still if\r\nhe had not been frozen to death last winter, at the age of 107, in a\r\nsudden blizzard. He was a negro, and had over 200 descendants.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Thomas, of Reading, Penn., who had lived a century,\r\nmight be still living if she had not been killed last year, while\r\nwalking on the railroad track.\r\n\r\nOf those who overrun the century, we might mention further, Simon\r\nHarras, who died in Putnam Co., Indiana, last January, aged 109. His\r\nmemory was good to the last.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Small, relict of Dr. Samuel Small, at Lewiston, Maine,\r\nhad passed her hundredth birthday a few weeks, when she died of\r\napoplexy; and Mrs. Susan Phillips, of Wilson Creek, N. C., died last\r\nyear just as she finished her century.\r\n\r\nNathan, formerly slave of Benj. W. Bodie, died last year in\r\nMississippi, Talbot Co., aged 107.\r\n\r\nChristopher Mann, of Independence, Missouri, died last year, aged 111.\r\n\r\nThe oldest of all, and probably the oldest minister in the world, is\r\nRev. Thos. Tenant, of Vineyard Township, Arkansas, an itinerant\r\nMethodist preacher, born in 1771, now in his 116th year.\r\n\r\nMr. Edward Gentry told a more remarkable story at Indianapolis, last\r\nJuly. He was at the governor's office, and gentlemen were guessing at\r\nhis age. None supposed him over fifty; but he said he had a son\r\nfifty-two years old, and was himself seventy-eight. He added: \"My\r\ndoctor has given me a fifty years' longer lease on my life, barring\r\naccidents. My father is 128 and is still living. My mother died at the\r\nage of 117, and her mother lived to the same age.\" Mr. Gentry is of\r\nEnglish birth.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best specimen of family health is that of the Atkinson\r\nfamily of Gloucester, Mass. Nine children were born, and all lived.\r\nThe first death in the family was a few weeks ago, when John Atkinson\r\ndied, aged eighty-four. When he died the ages of the nine amounted to\r\n703 years.\r\n\r\nAunt Dinah John, the oldest Indian at the Onondaga reservation died in\r\nMay, 1884, aged 109.\r\n\r\nAbout ten years ago, when Governor Seymour was about to make an\r\naddress at an Indian fair on the Onondaga reservation, Aunt Dinah\r\nwalked upon the platform and asked to be introduced to him.\r\n\r\nMr. Gardner said, \"Governor Seymour, this is Aunt Dinah, who wants to\r\nbecome acquainted with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; him get acquainted with me,\" Aunt Dinah explained. \"Me know\r\nhim before he know anybody. Many years ago me go to Pompey Hill, his\r\nfather's grocery. Governor's father say: 'My squaw very sick.' I ask,\r\n'What matter?' His father say, 'Go in and see for yourself.' He go\r\ninto a room; see a little pappoose about a foot long.\" Then moving\r\ntoward Governor Seymour, and pointing her finger at him, she said:\r\n\"That pappoose was you, Governor Seymour, born that night.\"\r\n\r\nAunt Dinah called frequently at Mr. Seymour's and took especial\r\ndelight in rocking the cradle and showering caresses in her native\r\nfashion upon the future Governor of the State.\r\n\r\nAbout three years ago she became blind, and has since been kept at her\r\nhome on the Onondaga reservation. She retained her faculties to the\r\nlast. Her husband died thirty years ago. Her dying request was that\r\nthe pagan ceremony be first observed and afterward the Christian\r\nritual.\r\n\r\nWhat are we to reckon, says the _Home Journal_, as the declining\r\nperiod of man's existence? The point at which old age taps us on the\r\nshoulder, and says it comes to keep us company, varies with every\r\nindividual. It depends a great deal on circumstances, which are hardly\r\nthe same in any two cases. Some writers have said that a man is old at\r\nforty-five, others have set down seventy as the normal standard. Dr.\r\nJohn Gardner, who has written on \"Longevity,\" remarks: \"Long\r\nobservation has convinced me that sixty-three is an age at which the\r\nmajority of persons may be termed old, and as a general rule we may\r\nadopt this as the epoch of the commencing decline of life.\"\r\n\r\nSuppose then we agree to call no man old till he is past sixty-three.\r\nLet us set down the names of some of the illustrious people of the\r\nworld who have prolonged their days of usefulness after that age. We\r\nshall make a table of them, and begin it with those who have died at\r\nseventy,--that is to say, with those in whom the springs of life have\r\nnot stood still till they have had at least seven years of old age. It\r\nwill be found, however, to be far from exhaustive, and every reader\r\nmay find pleasure in adding to it from his own stock of information:\r\n\r\n    _Age at Death._\r\n\r\n    70--Columbus; Lord Chatham; Petrarch; Copernicus; Spallanzani;\r\n          Boerhaave; Gall.\r\n    71--Linnæus.\r\n    72--Charlemagne; Samuel Richardson; Allan Ramsey; John Locke;\r\n          Necker.\r\n    73--Charles Darwin; Thorwaldsen.\r\n    74--Handel; Frederick the Great; Dr. Jenner.\r\n    75--Haydn; Dugald Stewart.\r\n    76--Bossuet.\r\n    77--Thomas Telford; Sir Joseph Banks; Lord Beaconsfield.\r\n    78--Galileo; Corneille.\r\n    79--William Harvey; Robert Stevenson; Henry Cavendish.\r\n    80--Plato; Wordsworth; Ralph Waldo Emerson; Kant; Thiers; William\r\n          Cullen.\r\n    81--Buffon; Edward Young; Sir Edward Coke; Lord Palmerston.\r\n    82--Arnauld.\r\n    83--Wellington; Goethe; Victor Hugo.\r\n    84--Voltaire; Talleyrand; Sir William Herschel.\r\n    85--Cato the Wise; Newton; Benj. Franklin; Jeremy Bentham.\r\n    86--Earl Russell; Edmund Halley; Carlyle.\r\n    88--John Wesley.\r\n    89--Michael Angelo.\r\n    90--Sophocles.\r\n    99--Titian.\r\n   100--Fontenelle.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that they were exceptional in living so long, but if\r\nwhat the best authorities say be true, the exceptions ought to be the\r\npeople who died young, and not those who prolong their lives and carry\r\non their work till they are old. Few of us may find ourselves, like\r\nLord Palmerston, in our greatest vigor at seventy, or be able, like\r\nThiers, to rule France at eighty, or have any spirit for playing the\r\nauthor, like Goethe and Victor Hugo, when over eighty; or for playing\r\nthe musician, like Handel and Haydn, when over seventy; but by good\r\nmanagement we may do wonders.\r\n\r\nThe wisest men and the best have been conspicuous for working to the\r\nend, not taking the least advantage of the leisure to which one might\r\nthink they were entitled. They have found their joy in pursuing labors\r\nwhich they believed useful either to themselves or to others. John\r\nLocke began a \"Fourth Letter on Toleration\" only a few weeks before he\r\ndied, and \"the few pages in the posthumous volume, ending in an\r\nunfinished sentence, seem to have exhausted his remaining strength.\"\r\nThe fire of Galileo's genius burned to the very end. He was engaged in\r\ndictating to two of his disciples his latest theories on a favorite\r\nsubject, when the slow fever seized him that brought him to the grave.\r\nSir Edward Coke spent the last six years of his life in revising and\r\nimproving the works upon which his fame now rests. John Wesley only\r\nthe year before he died wrote: \"I am now an old man, decayed from head\r\nto foot.... However, blessed be God! I do not slack my labors; I can\r\npreach and write still.\" Arnauld, one of the greatest of French\r\ntheologians and philosophers, retained, says Disraeli, \"the vigor of\r\nhis genius and the command of his pen to his last day, and at the age\r\nof eighty-two was still the great Arnauld.\" It was he who, when urged\r\nin his old age to rest from his labors, exclaimed, \"Rest! Shall we not\r\nhave the whole of eternity to rest in?\"\r\n\r\nA healthy old age cannot be reached without the exercise of many\r\nvirtues. There must have been prudence, self-denial, and temperance at\r\nthe very least. According to the proverb, he that would be long an old\r\nman must begin early to be one, and the beginning early just means\r\ntaking a great many precautions commonly neglected till it is too\r\nlate. More people would be found completing their pilgrimage at a late\r\ndate if it were not that, as a French writer puts it, \"Men do not\r\nusually die; they kill themselves.\" It is carelessness about the most\r\nordinary rules of healthy living.\r\n\r\nThe enjoyment of old age may be looked on then as a reward, and the\r\naged may pride themselves on being heirs to a rich inheritance,\r\nassigned to forethought and common sense. Many years are an honor.\r\nThey are an honor even in the case of the worldly, and a great deal\r\nmore so when life has been regulated by motives higher than any the\r\nworld can show. \"The hoary head,\" says Solomon, \"is a crown of glory;\"\r\nbut he adds this qualification, \"if it be found in the way of\r\nrighteousness.\" Old people form a natural aristocracy, and to be\r\nranked among them may be recommended to all who have an ambition to\r\nclose their lives well up in the world.\r\n\r\nFor a picture of an old man in this enviable state of mind take\r\nCornaro. In his eighty-third year we find him congratulating himself\r\nthat in all probability he \"had still a series of years to live in\r\nhealth and spirits and to enjoy this beautiful world, which is indeed\r\nbeautiful to those who know how to make it so.\" Even at ninety-five he\r\nwrote of himself as \"sound and hearty, contented and cheerful.\" \"At\r\nthis age,\" he says, \"I enjoy at once two lives: one terrestrial, which\r\nI possess in fact; the other celestial, which I possess in thought;\r\nand this thought is equal to actual enjoyment, when founded on things\r\nwe are sure to attain, as I am sure to attain that celestial life,\r\nthrough the infinite mercy and goodness of God.\"\r\n\r\nJeremy Bentham, who lived to be eighty-five, retained to the last the\r\nfresh and cheerful temperament of a boy. John Wesley, who died when he\r\nwas eighty-eight, also had a happy disposition. \"I feel and grieve,\"\r\nhe says, \"but by the grace of God I fret at nothing.\" Goethe, who\r\nreached his eighty-third year, is another good example. Then there is\r\nBoerhaave, one of the most celebrated physicians of modern times, who\r\nheld that decent mirth is the salt of life. Indeed in the case of most\r\nold people, we believe it will be found that cheerfulness is one of\r\ntheir leading characteristics.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe recent death of Mr. Beecher, who with his splendid constitution\r\nought to have lived twenty years longer, illustrates the principles of\r\nhygiene which he blindly disregarded. For years he was threatened with\r\nthe form of death that seized him, and came near a fatal attack some\r\nyears ago in Chicago while delivering a lecture. Men of a strong\r\nanimal nature, hearty eaters, and restless workers, making great use\r\nof the brain, are liable to such attacks. If Mr. Beecher had observed\r\nordinary prudence, and had a little scientific magnetic treatment, he\r\nwould never have had an apoplectic attack; but he was commonplace in\r\nthought. He went the old way, and died as short-sighted men die. He\r\nhad read my \"Anthropology,\" and told me he kept it in his library, but\r\nits thought did not enter into his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE TO THE INDIANS.\r\n\r\nBY JOHN BEESON.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Grant placed them under control of the churches, making them\r\nresponsible for all their Indian agents, whom the churches were to\r\nnominate. But as fraud and war have been more or less as rampant as\r\never, it seems that the first thing should be, to relieve the Indians\r\nfrom church rule, and recognize at once the Indian's inalienable right\r\nto \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\" the same as we claim\r\nfor ourselves; so long as they do not disturb the peace or violate the\r\nrights of their white neighbors, we have no right to interfere with\r\neither their religion or laws upon their reserves. It is this\r\nmeddlesome injustice which makes all the trouble; it would make\r\ntrouble with any other community, if another religious sect should be\r\nallowed to dominate over them in all their affairs. It is not Indian,\r\nbut human, nature, to do so, the world over. Dr. Bland, editor of _The\r\nCouncil Fire_, says:\r\n\r\n    \"I have been long and intimately acquainted with many tribes.\r\n    I find that they are not savages, but the peers of white men,\r\n    with great self-respect, a high sense of honor, and love of\r\n    truth.\"\r\n\r\nEven the civilized tribes still retain their mutual confidence. Hence,\r\nthey use no locks, no bolts nor bars, when absent from their homes; a\r\nstake in the ground, about three feet from the door, is a sufficient\r\nguarantee from intrusion. It would be deemed a reflection upon\r\nneighborly honor to lock a door in the Indian Territory. I was there\r\nwhen they built their first prison; they now number sixty thousand,\r\nmost of whom have lived there forty years, and then, they said,\r\n\r\n    \"The new railroad brought so many white renegades among us\r\n    that we had to build a prison for them.\"\r\n\r\nI asked, \"What do you do when one Indian kills another?\" They\r\nanswered: \"We have a trial, and if the killing was without great\r\ncause, we sentence the guilty one to be killed by the near of kin to\r\nhis victim; we appoint the time and the place, and we have never known\r\nan Indian to fail to come voluntarily in time for his own execution.\"\r\n\r\nThey believe that the Great Spirit will give all the hell or all the\r\nheaven that each deserves; that there is no possibility of escape from\r\na just penalty and no danger of losing a deserved heaven, but to them\r\nit is unjust to hope for anything on the merits of another. H. W.\r\nBeecher said in his first lecture after his return from the Pacific\r\nCoast:\r\n\r\n    \"I made special inquiry of those who are posted on Indian\r\n    affairs, as to their moral status, and was always told that\r\n    when fairly treated they are quite reliable.\"\r\n\r\nGen. Crookes said of the Apaches, that while they were protected on\r\ntheir reserves from outside aggression they were as well behaved and\r\norderly as any community of people in the United States.\r\n\r\nIt is true, they killed Generals Canby and Custer, but the first had,\r\ncontrary to preliminary agreement, moved his soldiers twenty-five\r\nmiles, and placed them in two companies on each side of the place\r\nwhere the treaty was to be made. The first demand of the Modoc chief\r\nwas, to take back the soldiers, and it was not until a long delay, and\r\na firm refusal on the part of Canby, that the Modoc chief fired the\r\nfatal shot.\r\n\r\nAnd as for Custer and his men, they fell while ignobly, and without\r\nright or authority, invading the peaceful home of Sitting Bull and his\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harney says:\r\n\r\n    \"I have lived fifty years on the frontier, and I have never\r\n    known an Indian war in which they were not in the right.\"\r\n\r\nDr. McLaughlin said:\r\n\r\n    \"I have been fifty-three years an Indian trader, and more than\r\n    fifty years superintendent of the Hudson Bay Fur Company, and\r\n    in all that time, I have never seen an occasion to shed the\r\n    blood of an Indian. The American people suppose that their\r\n    revenge is proof of savagery. But that is a mistake. It is\r\n    their sense of justice, and whatever they do is but an echo of\r\n    what has been done to them. They believe as Moses taught,\r\n    blood for blood, life for life.\"\r\n\r\nGen. Fremont said:\r\n\r\n    \"I lived two years among the Indians with only one white\r\n    woman, and was never more kindly treated. I lost nothing,\r\n    although all I had was accessible to them.\"\r\n\r\nSurely, testimony like this, in connection with their healing\r\nmagnetism so freely given to Spiritualism, should awaken sympathy if\r\nnot gratitude in their behalf.--_New Thought_.\r\n\r\n_Talent, Oregon_, Jan. 19, 1887.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS INTELLIGENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nANATOMY OF THE BRAIN.--Anatomy is considered the driest and most\r\ndifficult of biological studies, but a careful attention to our\r\ndescription of the brain will show that it is very intelligible. After\r\nwe get through with the anatomy, the description of organs and their\r\nfunctions is simple and practical. Every one should understand the\r\noutlines of cerebral anatomy, and then he can discuss the subject with\r\nimperfectly educated physicians, and show them their errors.\r\n\r\n\r\nMESMERIC CURES of countless variety and marvelous success have\r\noccurred all through the present century. But when not effected by\r\ndistinguished physicians, they have generally been ignored by the\r\npress, and their knowledge confined to a very narrow circle. Now,\r\nhowever, since eminent physicians at Paris are engaged, and the word\r\n_hypnotism_ is substituted for mesmerism and magnetism, their\r\nperformances are proclaimed by journalists and even by the medical\r\npress. The following is one of the latest reports. The reader will\r\nobserve that when the medical faculty after a prolonged opposition\r\nyield to any new idea, they endeavor to ignore entirely the pioneers\r\nby whom the discoveries were made, and by whom an interest was created\r\nin the subject while the faculty were hostile. It will probably not be\r\nlong before they adopt the leading ideas of homoeopathy and endeavor\r\nto obliterate the memory of Hahnemann.\r\n\r\n\"Hypnotism has been employed with considerable success in Paris for\r\nsome time past in the treatment of hysterical diseases, by Charcot and\r\nothers, but the case recently reported by M. Clovis Hugues, in France,\r\nis the most extraordinary application so far on record. A young lady\r\nof twenty was attacked six months ago with a nervous ailment which\r\ncompletely derived her of her voice. Electricity was tried, with a\r\ncertain amount of success, but after a time it lost its effect and was\r\nabandoned in despair. As a last resort, her friends applied to Dr.\r\nBerillon, the hypnotic specialist. After consultation with Dr.\r\nCharcot, he undertook the cure. The girl was thrown into a mesmeric\r\ntrance by the usual means, and Dr. Berillon suggested that she should\r\nsay on waking, 'I am twenty.' On opening her eyes she uttered these\r\nwords without the least effort. On the second day the suggestion was\r\nthat she should converse with Dr. Berillon, and this she also did, but\r\ncould talk with no one else. On the third day the doctor commanded her\r\nto talk with any one and at any time that she chose. She has been able\r\nto use her tongue freely ever since.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL DESPOTISM.--The infamous law juggled through the Legislature\r\nof Iowa, which deprives every citizen of the right of relieving her\r\nneighbor of disease without the authority of a diploma, and renders\r\nChristian benevolence a crime, does not produce much effect. The\r\nnatural healers pay no respect to it. In every prosecution under the\r\nlaw so far, the attempt to enforce the law has been defeated. Juries\r\nare unwilling to aid an ignorant Legislature in trampling on the\r\nDivine law and the principles of American constitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DANGEROUS CLASSES.--The existence of considerable classes, chiefly\r\nof foreigners, who are contemplating murder and rapine, should\r\ninterest every good citizen. At Cincinnati on the 6th of March, it is\r\nsaid, \"The institution of the Paris commune in 1848 and 1871 was\r\ncelebrated tonight by the Cincinnati anarchists. It was the most\r\nrevolutionary gathering ever seen in this city, and the speech of Mrs.\r\nLucy E. Parsons, wife of the condemned anarchist, was of a very\r\ninflammatory character. The hall was crowded with men and women who\r\ndrank beer at tables. It was a motley and dangerous looking throng. On\r\nthe walls were mottoes with red borders, and the entire hall was\r\nprofusely decorated with large red flags. There wasn't an American\r\nflag in the hall, and above the stage was a picture of the condemned\r\nanarchists. Several pictures of notorious Anarchists who have been\r\nbeheaded for murder and riot were conspicuously displayed. The band\r\nplayed no national airs except the 'Marseillaise,' and everything said\r\nand done showed a bitter hatred of American institutions. Mrs. Parsons\r\ngave a history of the Paris commune of 1871, and said the mistake made\r\nwas in showing any mercy to capitalists. Her remarks were loudly\r\napplauded, although a majority of her audience couldn't understand one\r\nword of English. Dancing followed the speeches, and was kept up all\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nARBITRATION.--In the Sinaloa colony, \"Any disputes that arise between\r\ncolonists will be settled by arbitration. There will be one lawyer to\r\nprotect the interests of the corporation in dealings with outside\r\nparties.\" This is a great step in advance. When a true civilization\r\narrives, arbitration will supersede courts, and psychometry will\r\nassist in making it perfect.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRITICISM ON THE CHURCH.--If any readers of the JOURNAL think its\r\ncriticisms on the church have been too harsh, because their own\r\nacquaintance is confined to worthy professors of the present time, I\r\nwould call their attention to the unquestionable statements of Hallam,\r\nGuizot, and Draper, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"With respect to the last, the grandest of all human undertakings\r\n(i. e., the circumnavigation of the earth), it is to be remembered\r\nthat Catholicism had irrevocably committed itself to the dogma of a\r\nflat earth, with the sky as a floor of heaven, and hell in the under\r\nworld.\"--_Draper's Conflict_, p. 294.\r\n\r\n\"Persecution for religious heterodoxy, in all its degrees, was in the\r\nsixteenth century the principle as well as the practice of every\r\nchurch.\"--_Hallam's Middle Ages_, vol. 2, p. 48.\r\n\r\n\"When any step was taken to establish a system of permanent\r\ninstitutions, which might effectually protect liberty from the\r\ninvasions of power in general, _the church always ranged herself on\r\nthe side of despotism_.\"--_Guizot's History of Civilization in\r\nEurope_, p. 154.\r\n\r\n\"There was fighting and fighting between the old and new school, and\r\nall on a question that would make a crab laugh,--questions that were\r\nhypercritical and infinite, and about which everybody knew nothing at\r\nall, and they thought they knew as well as God. Questions were talked\r\nof with positiveness, and argued; and, when I look back upon them, I\r\ncannot help thinking they were no better than the contentions of\r\nchildren around the cradle. But all this gave me great repulsion for\r\ndogmatic theology, and it is a repulsion which I have not got over,\r\nand the present prospects are that I never shall.\"--_Henry Ward\r\nBeecher_.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARTHQUAKES AND PREDICTIONS.--Professor Rudolf Falb, of Vienna, it is\r\nreported, predicted to an hour the earthquakes which have occurred in\r\nFrance and Italy.\r\n\r\n\"Writing in the Austrian papers some days ago, he pointed out that the\r\nannular eclipse of the sun, which commenced on Tuesday morning at 6.41\r\nGreenwich time, was central at 9.13 P. M., and ended on the earth\r\ngenerally at twenty-five minutes past midnight on Wednesday morning,\r\nwas likely to be accompanied with strong atmospheric and seismic\r\ndisturbances. The learned physicist has gained great reputation by\r\nprevious similar forecasts. His first and great success was the\r\nforetelling the destructive shock at Belluno, on June 29, 1873. Nearly\r\nthe whole of Northern Italy was affected, and upwards of fifty lives\r\nwere lost. Very shortly afterwards he gave warning of the probability\r\nof an eruption of Etna, which followed at the time anticipated in\r\n1874.\"--_London Echo_.\r\n\r\n\"John S. Newberry, professor of geology and paleontology at Columbia\r\nCollege, being the American authority upon all matters pertaining to\r\nthe crust of the earth, was naturally interested in the earthquake\r\nthat visited Long Island on Wednesday. He derides the idea that the\r\nlocal seismic disturbance has any connection with the recent\r\noccurrences at Mentone, as the shocks were too far apart, and, if\r\nconnected, should have been felt within eight hours of each other,\r\nwhereas there was several days' difference. His theory, which is amply\r\nsustained by observation, is that an earthquake is a movement caused\r\nby a shrinking, from loss of heat, of the interior of the earth and\r\nthe crushing together and displacement of the rigid exterior as it\r\naccommodates itself to this contraction. It has been noticed that the\r\nearth is shaken along the Alleghany chain nearly every year. It is\r\nimpossible to predict a recurrence of the shocks, but it is quite\r\nprobable they will recur. There is a record of 231 earthquakes in the\r\nNew England States between the years 1638 and 1869.\"--_Brooklyn\r\nEagle_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II--STRUCTURE OF THE BRAIN.\r\n\r\n    Man a triple being--Materialists and illusionists misconceive\r\n    him--Relation of the soul to the brain and body--The nervous\r\n    system; illustration--Embryonic condition--Anatomical\r\n    descriptions unsatisfactory and the phrenological school\r\n    incorrect--Exterior view of the brain in the head, illustrated\r\n    and described--The cerebrum, cerebellum, and\r\n    tentorium--Interior view of the base of the skull--Bones of\r\n    the head illustrated--Division of the brain into lobes and\r\n    convolutions, with illustration--Frontal, middle, parietal,\r\n    tempero-sphenoidal, and occipital--Anatomical plan or grouping\r\n    of convolutions differs from their actual appearance--View of\r\n    the superior surface illustrated--Difference between the\r\n    irregular convolutions and the angular maps--View of the\r\n    inferior surface of the brain--Illustration and description of\r\n    the parts--Interior view of section on the median\r\n    line--Divided and undivided surfaces-_Corpus callosum_\r\n    explained--The two brains and their diagonal relations to the\r\n    body--Penetrating and describing the lateral ventricles--The\r\n    serum in the brain--Variations of serum and blood--Variations\r\n    in hydrocephalus and insanity--Our power to modify the brain\r\n    and change our destiny--Power of education--Responsibility of\r\n    society--The lateral ventricles the centre of the brain--Base\r\n    of the ventricles, the great inferior ganglia of the brain,\r\n    _corpora striata_, and _thalami_--Their radiating fibres\r\n    inclosing a cavity--The _thalami_ and their commissure and\r\n    third ventricle--The _medulla oblongata_, cerebellum, and\r\n    _arbor vitæ_--The _pons Varolii_ and crura of the brain--the\r\n    _corpora quadrigemina_, pineal gland, fourth ventricle, and\r\n    _calamus scriptorius_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMan is essentially a triple organization, consisting of the permanent\r\npsychic being, intangible to our external senses, but nevertheless so\r\ndistinctly recognized internally by consciousness and externally or in\r\nothers, by intuition and understanding, that the psychic is as well\r\nunderstood and known as the physical being. This being is the eternal\r\nman--the material body being its temporary associate.\r\n\r\nThe physical being, or material form, consists of the portion directly\r\nand entirely occupied by the psychic existence--which is called the\r\nbrain or encephalon, and is in life also beyond the reach of our\r\nsenses in the interior of the cranium--and the non-psychic structure,\r\nthe body, which, though not the residence of the soul, has so intimate\r\nand complete a connection with the entire brain that during active\r\nlife it feels as if it were the actual residence of the soul, so far\r\nas sensation and action are concerned.\r\n\r\nThe soul, or psychic being, has external and internal perceptions (for\r\nwhich it has cerebral organs). When the former predominate too\r\ngreatly, the human body and all external objects are realized most\r\nvividly, and the reality of psychic life is not so well realized or\r\nunderstood. Hence persons so organized are disposed to materialism,\r\nand either doubt the existence of their psychic being, or are\r\nindifferent to it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, those in whom the interior faculties predominate\r\ntoo greatly vividly realize their psychic life, but have more vague\r\nand feeble conceptions of material objects, including their own\r\nbodies, and attach undue importance to the imaginary and subjective in\r\npreference to the objective. The materialists and the illusionists,\r\nhowever, are not entirely composed of these two classes of subjective\r\nand objective thinkers. The majority consists of persons of moderate\r\nreasoning capacity, who simply follow their leaders.\r\n\r\nIn making a critical distinction between the psycho-organic brain and\r\nnon-psychic body, the former may be confined strictly within the\r\ncranium, leaving the exterior portions of the head as a part of the\r\nnon-psychic body; but as they are more intimately associated with the\r\nbrain than any part below the neck, this distinction is not important;\r\nand if the whole head, as the environment of the psychic brain, be\r\ngrouped with it, it may not lead to any material error. The brain is\r\nintimately associated with the entire physical person by twelve pairs\r\nof cranial or cerebral nerves, and by the spinal cord, which descends\r\nfrom the base of the brain through a great foramen or opening midway\r\nbetween the ears, and while passing down the spinal column gives off\r\nthirty pairs of nerves.\r\n\r\nThe cranial nerves are all for the head, except the _pneumogastric_ or\r\nlung-stomach nerve, which belongs to the organs of respiration, voice,\r\nand digestion; and the spinal nerves are all for the body, except a\r\nfew which ramify in the neck and in the scalp.\r\n\r\nThe entire nervous system is so instantaneously prompt in conveying to\r\nthe brain the impressions which originate feeling, and in conveying\r\nfrom the brain the nervous energies that produce voluntary motion and\r\nmodify all the processes of life, that we feel as if we had sensation\r\nand volition in every part of the body; or, in other words, that our\r\nconscious existence was in the body; but we rationally know that the\r\nsensation and volition occur in the brain, for neither sensation nor\r\nvoluntary motion can occur if the nervous connection with the brain is\r\ninterrupted by compression and section, or if the brain itself be\r\nsufficiently compressed. When the brain is exposed by an injury of the\r\ncranium, the pressure of a finger suspends all consciousness and\r\nvolition, making a blank in the life of the individual.\r\n\r\nAnimal life resides in the nervous system alone, and its character is\r\nproportioned to the development thereof, of which the brain is the\r\nprincipal mass. A subordinate portion of the general life, however, is\r\nin the nervous system of the body, and in proportion as the brain\r\ndeclines in development the relative amount of psychic energy in the\r\nbody is greater. Thus the body of the alligator after decapitation is\r\ncapable of sensation and voluntary acts, such as pushing away an\r\noffending body with its foot. The character of the life in the body is\r\nexplained by physiology and sarcognomy. Its universal presence is due\r\nto the universal diffusion of the nervous system, of which the\r\naccompanying figure, showing the location of the spinal cord and\r\nspinal nerves, will give a proper conception. In this figure the\r\nspinal cord, with its thirty pairs of nerves, eight cervical at the\r\nneck, twelve dorsal in the back, five lumbar in the loins, and five or\r\nsix in the sacrum (between the hips), is seen descending from the base\r\nof the brain below the cerebellum (which is rather too large in\r\nengraving), and proceeding throughout the body until lost in fine\r\nramifications which the microscope can scarcely trace, but which\r\nquickly inform us if they are touched or disturbed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt cannot properly be said that the spinal cord proceeds from the\r\nbrain, nor on the other hand that the brain proceeds from the spinal\r\ncord, for they originate simultaneously in a soft, jelly-like\r\ncondition in which the microscope cannot detect the latent structure,\r\nnot as they are in the adult, but as they are in the foetus in which\r\nthey first appear, with a structure similar to that of the lowest\r\nclass of vertebrate animals, the fishes.\r\n\r\nFrom this embryonic condition, in which there is very little\r\nresemblance to the adult brain, its progress has been carefully traced\r\nby many observers, but chiefly by Tiedemann, through all the stages of\r\nlife before birth into the soft, infantile form of the human brain.\r\nSome knowledge of this embryonic growth is necessary to a correct\r\nunderstanding of the adult brain, its essential plan, its growth, and\r\nthe correct estimate of its development.\r\n\r\nI have not found in our anatomical works what I consider a\r\nsatisfactory exposition of this subject. Beginning as a student with\r\nSpurzheim's anatomy of the brain, which ought to have been the\r\nclearest and most complete of all, I found it so obscure and\r\nunsatisfactory that until I had made many dissections I had no very\r\nclear understanding. I have never found any pleasure in the writings\r\nof Spurzheim. In more recent authors the anatomical details are very\r\nabundant indeed, and sufficient to tax the _memory_ heavily, but\r\nwithout that system and philosophy which appeal to the understanding\r\nand make our conceptions satisfactory, as I hope to make them to my\r\nreaders, who must have very incorrect conceptions of the plan of the\r\nbrain, if they have relied upon the writings of Mr. Combe and his\r\nsuccessors of the phrenological school, none of whom, so far as I am\r\naware, have really understood cerebral anatomy.\r\n\r\nLet us approach the subject by taking an exterior and general view,\r\nthen by tracing the embryonic growth of the brain, and the interior\r\nconnections of its fibres, until we are fully prepared to judge of its\r\ndevelopment as it lies in the skull, and to understand the relation of\r\neach organ to all other portions. Then we can study its functions with\r\na clear understanding of the relations of the organs to each other,\r\nwhich is the material basis of psychic science, and with full\r\nconfidence in our ability to judge and compare living heads and skulls\r\nof man and animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLet us take an exterior view by removing one half of the skull from\r\nthe right side of the head. This enables us to see that the front\r\nportion of the brain rests above the sockets of the eyes, coming down\r\nin the centre as low as the root of the nose, but a little higher\r\nexteriorly. When we touch the forehead just over the root of the nose,\r\nour finger touches the lowest level of the front lobe, the seat of the\r\nintellect; but when we touch the external angle of the brow on the\r\nsame level, we touch a process of bone, and our finger is fully half\r\nan inch below the level of the brain.\r\n\r\nIn the posterior view we see that below the great mass of brain which\r\nis called the cerebrum there lies a smaller body, shaped much like a\r\nsmall turnip, called the cerebellum or little brain, separated from\r\nthe cerebrum by a firm, horizontal membrane called the tentorium\r\n(covering the cerebellum), on which the cerebrum rests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe position of the tentorium can easily be ascertained in your own\r\nhead by the fact that where it crosses the median line there is a\r\nlittle projection of bone called the occipital knob, very prominent on\r\nsome persons, barely perceptible on others. After locating the\r\noccipital knob, a horizontal line forward will give us the portion of\r\nthe tentorium. When we carry this line forward just over the cavity of\r\nthe ear, thus locating the tentorium, we easily recognize below it the\r\nrounded prominence on each side in which the two hemispheres or halves\r\nof the cerebellum lie, with a depression between them on the median\r\nline. To make these and other observations on the head (which no one\r\nshould neglect), the hand should be placed firmly on the scalp, so\r\nthat as it slides on the bone we feel the form of the skull beneath.\r\nIn most persons a distinct depression will be felt along the line of\r\nthe tentorium, separating the cerebrum and cerebellum--the cerebellum\r\nbeing located at the summit of the neck, and extending down about as\r\nlow as the end of the mastoid process, which is the large, long\r\nprominence just behind the cavity of the ear.\r\n\r\nThe cerebellum may be regarded as the physiological and the cerebrum\r\nas the psychic brain, for the cerebellum is void of intelligence and\r\nvolition, but has important influences on the body. It may be\r\nconsidered, like the spinal cord, an intermediate structure between\r\nthe controlling and conscious brain and the corporeal organs.\r\n\r\nThe tentorium does not entirely separate it from the cerebrum, for\r\nanteriorly it is open to permit the passage of the fibres which\r\nconnect the cerebrum with the spinal cord and the cerebellum,--fibres\r\nwhich pass up midway between the right and left ear, so that a bullet\r\nfired horizontally through from ear to ear would sever the connection\r\nof the cerebrum with the bodily organs, producing instant death. This\r\nwill be understood by looking at the profile of the interior of the\r\nright hemisphere, on which we see the position of the pons and the\r\nmedulla and their relation to the cerebrum by their ascending fibres.\r\nAs these ascending fibres correspond to a position just above the\r\ncavity of the ear, and as they are the channels of all muscular\r\nimpulses, the reader will perceive that breadth of head immediately\r\nabove the cavity of the ear must be associated with muscular\r\nimpulsiveness.\r\n\r\nThe position of the cerebrum in the cranium may be best understood by\r\nsawing the head in two horizontally, taking out the brain, and looking\r\ndown into the base of the skull, in which we see anteriorly a shelf\r\nfor the front lobes, behind which are the cavities for the middle\r\nlobes, and behind that the rounded cavities for the cerebellum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThus the front lobe occupies the highest plane, resting on the vault\r\nof the sockets of the eyes, and extending back as far as the sockets.\r\nThe middle lobe lies behind the sockets of the eyes and above the\r\ncavities of the ears, its base being as low as the bottom of the\r\nsockets of the eyes and corresponding nearly with the upper edge of\r\nthe cheekbone, as it extends from the sockets to the side of the head\r\njust in front of the ears. In the posterior base of the skull, the\r\nreader will observe an opening (_foramen magnum_ or large foramen)\r\nthrough which the spinal cord ascends. The spinal cord is exposed in\r\nthe neck below the foramen.\r\n\r\nGoing back, we find the middle lobe rises higher, ascending over the\r\ncavity of the ear and resting upon the ridge of bone in which the\r\napparatus of hearing is situated, thus reaching the level of the\r\ntentorium, on which the occipital lobe rests.\r\n\r\nThe bones of the cranium seen by looking down into the basis of the\r\nskull, as above, are the frontal bone over the eyes, the sphenoid\r\nbone, behind the sockets of the eyes, extending from the right to the\r\nleft temple, the temporal bones, forming the ridge that holds the\r\napparatus of hearing, and extending up about two inches on the side\r\nhead, and the occipital bone at the back, between the two temporals,\r\nmeeting the sphenoid bone in the centre of the base. The cerebellum\r\nrests in the deep double concavities of the occipital bone, and the\r\nspinal cord ascends through the large opening (foramen magnum) in the\r\nmiddle of its base, assuming the form called the medulla oblongata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen we fully understand this view of the base of the skull, let us\r\nlook at it in profile, and observe the frontal bone connected by the\r\ncoronal suture to the parietal and the parietal by the squamous or\r\nscaly suture to the temporal, and by the lambdoid suture to the\r\noccipital. The sphenoid or bat-wing bone appears in the temples by its\r\nwing, between the frontal and temporal, while in the centre of the\r\nbase its solid body is between the frontal and occipital.\r\n\r\nThe sphenoid bone is in contact with organs of sensitive delicacy,\r\nrefinement, and inspiration, the occipital with organs of vital force,\r\nthe temporal with organs of appetite, excitement, and force, the\r\nfrontal with organs of intellect and refined benevolence, the parietal\r\nwith the organs of virtue, amiability, self control, and general\r\nstrength of character, which make a superior person.\r\n\r\nModern anatomists do not divide the brain into front, middle, and\r\noccipital lobes as would seem most natural, by erecting vertical lines\r\nfrom their bases, but follow up the oblique courses of the\r\nconvolutions so as to extend the front lobe into the upper surface of\r\nthe brain, and extend the middle lobe from the middle of the upper\r\nsurface backward into the region of Self Confidence, giving the name\r\nof temporo-sphenoidal to its lower portion behind the sockets of the\r\neyes and over the ears, which name is taken from the temporal bone,\r\nthat contains the apparatus of hearing, forming the middle of the\r\nbasis of the skull, and the sphenoid bone, which lies just back of the\r\nsockets of the eyes, supporting the front end of the lower portion of\r\nthe middle lobe, called temporo-sphenoidal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe sphenoid bone thus sustains the region of Sensibility, while the\r\ntemporal bone lodges the organs of the most sensual, selfish, and\r\nviolent impulses, the action of which is downward into the muscular\r\nand visceral organs of the body. The sphenoid bone as it extends up\r\ntouches the base of the front lobe and of the Ideal region, where it\r\nassumes the name of Somnolence. (See the profile view of the cranium.)\r\n\r\nThe upper portion of the middle lobe has been given the name of\r\nparietal, as it has a general correspondence with the parietal bones,\r\nwhile the occipital lobe has a general correspondence in position with\r\nthe occipital bone, as will be seen by comparing the plan of the brain\r\nseen in profile with the engraving of the cranium.\r\n\r\nThe _plan_ of the brain is given, instead of an engraving of the\r\nactual convoluted surface, to simplify the study to the learner. An\r\nexamination of the brain itself or of a good model offers at first\r\nsight such a vague and irregular mass of convolutions, differing so\r\nmuch in different brains, that any systematic arrangement would seem\r\nimpossible. But by studying the subject more extensively and\r\nconsidering the structure of the simpler brains of animals, in which\r\nthe complexity of the human brain is reduced to simpler forms, a mode\r\nof grouping and classifying the convolutions has been adopted by\r\nanatomists which is illustrated by the engraving, in which we see, not\r\nthe numerous convolutions of a well developed human brain, but the\r\ngroups in which they have been arranged by the aid of comparative\r\nanatomy.\r\n\r\nThe front lobe is grouped into the superior, middle, and inferior\r\nconvolutions, or groups of convolutions, and the ascending frontal;\r\nbut the inspection of a brain would show an irregularity of forms in\r\nwhich a casual observer would be puzzled to trace this arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the brain, divested of its membranes, when we look\r\nupon its superior surface, is shown in the annexed engraving, in which\r\nit is presented as it lies in the head when the cranium and membranes\r\nare removed which form the rim of the figure. The front lobe is the\r\nupper portion, and the outline of the nose is just visible. In the\r\nfull exposition of this subject hereafter in a larger work, I propose\r\nto show the exact seats of the various functions in the convolutions,\r\nwhich are much more irregular than the angular figures we make on the\r\nsurface of the head to show the average positions of organs. Of course\r\nno intelligent person supposes the psychological maps and busts of the\r\norgans to be representations of the brain, or anything more than\r\napproximations to the true interior organology, which, however, do not\r\nlead to any great error, as adjacent portions of convolutions have\r\nvery analogous functions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen we place the brain on its upper surface and inspect the bottom,\r\nwe observe at the back the cerebellum, which dips into the neck, the\r\nmiddle lobe, which is over the ears and the side face, and the front\r\nlobe, which rests over the eyes.\r\n\r\nWe observe posteriorly the medulla oblongata, on the face of which we\r\nmay observe the crossing of the fibres, and on the side of which we\r\nobserve the origins of many nerves. Above the medulla we observe the\r\npons Varolii, just above which we observe the fibres ascending to each\r\nhemisphere under the name of _crus cerebri_, or thigh of the cerebrum.\r\nNext we see the optic nerves crossing on the median line, the\r\nolfactory nerve, running under the front lobe, which is separated by\r\nthe fissure of Sylvius from the middle lobe. There is also a glimpse\r\nof the corpus callosum at its anterior end, obtained by pulling the\r\nfront lobes apart at the median line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLet us next cut through the head exactly on the median line, dividing\r\nthe right and left hemispheres, and look at the inner face of the\r\nright hemisphere. We observe that it has convolutions, just like the\r\nexterior surface, which do not join across the median line, but are\r\nseparated from those of the left hemisphere by a firm membrane (an\r\nextension of the dura mater or principal investing membrane) called\r\nthe falx, which is removed, leaving the convolutions in view.\r\n\r\nThe reader will observe that it is only in the lower portion of the\r\nengraving that he sees any surfaces produced by cutting to separate\r\nthe right and left halves of the brain. It is by these structures\r\nwhich are here divided that the right and left halves are connected,\r\nso that the whole brain is adapted to acting in a unitary manner.\r\n\r\nThe first section we encounter as we pass down is that of the _corpus\r\ncallosum_, a body of white fibre firmer than the external surface of\r\nthe brain, and therefore called the corpus callosum or callous body,\r\nwhich consists of white nerve fibres gathered in from nearly all parts\r\nof the brain on each side and crossing the median line. We may regard\r\nit as a mass of representative fibres rooted in the soft substance of\r\nthe convolutions or gray matter of the brain generally, and thus\r\nconnecting across the median line the corresponding parts of the right\r\nand left brain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that the brain like the body is double, and\r\nthat every organ is fully developed in each brain, so that no amount\r\nof injury or paralysis of organs would deprive us of any faculty,\r\nunless corresponding parts were destroyed in each hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe left brain governs the right half of the body, and the right brain\r\ngoverns the left half, the connecting fibres having their crossing\r\n(called decussation) in the spinal cord. Hence the left brain is\r\nusually more fully developed in the occipital and basilar regions than\r\nthe right, in right handed people, as may frequently be detected by a\r\ncareful examination of the head, or an inspection of the interior the\r\nskull. The left brain, also, seems to have a general ascendency over\r\nthe right; so that paralysis of speech is most generally produced by\r\ndisease in the region of language on the left side.\r\n\r\nWhatever occurs on one side of the body is in relation to the opposite\r\nside of the head. Paralysis, if not dependent on the spinal cord, is\r\ndependent on the basilar region of the opposite side of they brain;\r\nand conditions of the right eye affect the lower margin of the left\r\nfront lobe, in which the perceptive organs are situated.\r\n\r\nIf we thrust our fingers into the brain immediately under the corpus\r\ncallosum, pushing away the delicate little structure called the\r\n_septum lucidum_ (or translucent septum), and pressing down fornix\r\n(which is a thin, horizontal nerve membrane) we find that our fingers\r\nenter a cavity by pressing its walls apart, of which the corpus\r\ncallosum is the vault or roof,--a cavity which may be explored back\r\nand forth, far into the interior of the occipital lobe within an inch\r\nof the surface, and far into the front lobe, near the surface of the\r\nfrontal convolutions, as well as downwards and forwards into the\r\nbottom of the middle lobe (the part called temporo-sphenoidal). These\r\nextensions of this great cavity or ventricle are called the anterior\r\nand posterior horns (_cornua_) and the descending horn (_cornu_).\r\n\r\nTheir importance arises from the fact that in these ventricles of the\r\nright and left sides of the brain a watery fluid, effused from the\r\nblood, called serum, exists, which also extends downward along the\r\nspinal cord, and which has to do with the pressure and equilibrium of\r\nthe various parts. When there is a strong pressure of blood to the\r\nbrain on account of its unusual activity, especially in the activity\r\nof the emotions, the serum of the ventricles and also in the substance\r\nof the brain is absorbed, and the brain acquires a more compact\r\ntexture, which is found in all persons of strong mentality, the brain\r\nbeing hardened by exercise, as well as the muscles. But when the\r\naction of the brain is feeble, and the blood in an impoverished\r\ncondition, there is a greater tendency to the exudation of fluid; the\r\nsubstance of the brain is thereby softened, and serum, to the extent\r\nof one or more ounces, is frequently found in the ventricles,\r\nespecially when the brain is much impaired by disease of its\r\nsubstance. In some cases of hydrocephalus pints of serum are effused,\r\ndistending the brain and head enormously, and in many cases of\r\ninsanity the ventricles and membranes of the brain are distended with\r\nserum. \"Pritchard on Insanity\" speaks of this distention of the\r\nventricles, which were \"very full of serum\" in twenty-nine out of a\r\nhundred cases, and \"in twenty-three ready to burst,\" and \"in ten among\r\ntwenty-four melancholies astonishingly distended.\" Dr. Spurzheim\r\ndissected a case of hydrocephalus, child of eighteen months, with two\r\nand a half pounds of water in the membranes of the brain; and James\r\nCardinal, who died at the age of thirty years in London, had a pint of\r\nwater in the lateral ventricles, and about nine pints between the\r\nbrain and its membranes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUSINESS DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\n[Hand pointing right] _The first two numbers of the_ JOURNAL _were\r\nunavoidably delayed. The May number will appear in advance of the\r\nmonth._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe BUSINESS DEPARTMENT of the Journal deserves the attention of all\r\nits readers, as it will be devoted to matters of general interest and\r\nreal value. The treatment of the opium habit by Dr. Hoffman is\r\noriginal and successful. Dr. Hoffman is one of the most gifted members\r\nof the medical profession. The electric apparatus of D. H. Fitch is\r\nthat which I have found the most useful and satisfactory in my own\r\npractice. Mr. Fitch has recently perfected certain improvements in the\r\nGalvanic Battery, which enables him to furnish the best and cheapest\r\nwhich has ever been offered by any manufacturer. The _American\r\nSpectator_, edited by Dr. B. O. Flower, is conducted with ability and\r\ngood taste, making an interesting family paper, containing valuable\r\nhygienic and medical instruction, at a remarkably low price. It is\r\ndestined to have a very extensive circulation. I have written several\r\nessays in commendation of the treatment of disease by oxygen gas, and\r\nits three compounds, nitrous oxide, per-oxide and ozone. What is\r\nneeded for its general introduction is a convenient portable\r\napparatus. This is now furnished by Dr. B. M. Lawrence, at Hartford,\r\nConnecticut. A line addressed to him will procure the necessary\r\ninformation in his pamphlet on that subject. He can be consulted free\r\nof charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. W. F. Richardson of 875 Washington Street is one of the most\r\nsuccessful practitioners we have, as any one will realize who employs\r\nhim. Without specifying his numerous cases I would merely mention that\r\nhe has recently cured in a single treatment an obstinate case of\r\nchronic disease which had baffled the best physicians of Boston and\r\nLowell.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. K. MEYENBERG, who is the Boston agent for Oxygen Treatment, is a\r\nmost honorable, modest, and unselfish gentleman, whose superior\r\nnatural powers as a magnetic healer have been demonstrated during\r\neighteen years' practice in Washington City. Some of his cures have\r\nbeen truly marvelous. He has recently located in Boston as a magnetic\r\nphysician.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCollege of Therapeutics.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe large amount of scientific and therapeutic knowledge developed by\r\nrecent discoveries, but not yet admitted into the slow-moving medical\r\ncolleges, renders it important to all young men of liberal minds--to\r\nall who aim at the highest rank in their profession--to all who are\r\nstrictly conscientious and faithful in the discharge of their duties\r\nto patients under their care, to have an institution in which their\r\neducation can be completed by a preliminary or a post-graduate course\r\nof instruction.\r\n\r\nThe amount of practically useful knowledge of the healing art which is\r\nabsolutely excluded from the curriculum of old style medical colleges\r\nis greater than all they teach--not greater than the adjunct sciences\r\nand learning of a medical course which burden the mind to the\r\nexclusion of much useful therapeutic knowledge, but greater than all\r\nthe curative resources embodied in their instruction.\r\n\r\nThe most important of these therapeutic resources which have sometimes\r\nbeen partially applied by untrained persons are now presented in the\r\nCollege of Therapeutics, in which is taught not the knowledge which is\r\nnow represented by the degree of M. D., but a more profound knowledge\r\nwhich gives its pupils immense advantages over the common graduate in\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nTherapeutic Sarcognomy, a science often demonstrated and endorsed by\r\nable physicians, gives the anatomy not of the physical structure, but\r\nof the vital forces of the body and soul as located in every portion\r\nof the constitution--a science vastly more important than physical\r\nanatomy, as the anatomy of life is more important than the anatomy of\r\ndeath. Sarcognomy is the true basis of medical practice, while anatomy\r\nis the basis only of operative surgery and obstetrics.\r\n\r\nIndeed, every magnetic or electric practitioner ought to attend such a\r\ncourse of instruction to become entirely skilful in the correct\r\ntreatment of disease.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above instruction, special attention will be given\r\nto the science and art of Psychometry--the most important addition in\r\nmodern times to the practice of medicine, as it gives the physician\r\nthe most perfect diagnosis of disease that is attainable, and the\r\npower of extending his practice successfully to patients at any\r\ndistance. The methods of treatment used by spiritual mediums and \"mind\r\ncure\" practitioners will also be philosophically explained.\r\n\r\nThe course of instruction will begin on Monday, the 2d of May, and\r\ncontinue six weeks. The fee for attendance on the course will be $25.\r\nTo students who have attended heretofore the fee will be $15. For\r\nfurther information address the president,\r\n\r\n        JOSEPH RODES BUCHANAN, M. D.\r\n                6 JAMES ST., BOSTON.\r\n\r\nThe sentiments of those who have attended these courses of instruction\r\nduring the last eight years were concisely expressed in the following\r\nstatement, which was unanimously signed and presented to Dr. Buchanan\r\nby those attending his last course in Boston.\r\n\r\n\"The undersigned, attendant upon the seventh session of the College of\r\nTherapeutics, have been delighted with the profound and wonderful\r\ninstructions received, and as it is the duty of all who become\r\nacquainted with new truths of great importance to the world, to assist\r\nin their diffusion, we offer our free and grateful testimony in the\r\nfollowing resolutions:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the lectures and experiments of Prof. Buchanan have\r\nnot only clearly taught, but absolutely demonstrated, the science of\r\nSarcognomy, by experiments in which we were personally engaged, and in\r\nwhich we cannot possibly have been mistaken.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That we regard Sarcognomy as the most important addition\r\never made to physiological science by any individual, and as the basis\r\nof the only possible scientific system of Electro-Therapeutics, the\r\nsystem which we have seen demonstrated in all its details by Prof.\r\nBuchanan, producing results which we could not have believed without\r\nwitnessing the demonstration.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That Therapeutic Sarcognomy is a system of science of the\r\nhighest importance, alike to the magnetic healer, to the\r\nelectro-therapeutist, and to the medical practitioner,--giving great\r\nadvantages to those who thoroughly understand it, and destined to\r\ncarry the fame of its discoverer to the remotest future ages.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n            The \"Chlorine\" Galvanic and Faradic Batteries.\r\n\r\n                       APPARATUS AND MATERIALS.\r\n\r\n  Description, Prices, and Testimonials Mailed Free, on Application.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      AURORA, ILL., Dec. 24, 1886.\r\n\r\nD. H. FITCH, Cazenovia, N.

Y.:\r\n\r\nI am so well pleased with your \"Chlorine Faradic Machine\" that I now\r\nuse it in preference to any other. The current is so smooth and\r\nregular that patients like it and seem to derive more benefit from it\r\nthan from the same strength of current from any other battery that I\r\nhave used.
