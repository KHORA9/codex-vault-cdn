E. E. KELLOGG, A.M.\r\n\r\nSuperintendent of the Sanitarium School of Cookery and of the Bay View\r\nAssembly School of Cookery, and Chairman of the World's Fair Committee\r\non Food Supplies, for Michigan\r\n\r\n1893\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nThe interest in scientific cookery, particularly in cookery as related\r\nto health, has manifestly increased in this country within the last\r\ndecade as is evidenced by the success which has attended every\r\nintelligent effort for the establishment of schools for instruction in\r\ncookery in various parts of the United States. While those in charge of\r\nthese schools have presented to their pupils excellent opportunities for\r\nthe acquirement of dexterity in the preparation of toothsome and\r\ntempting viands, but little attention has been paid to the science of\r\ndietetics, or what might be termed the hygiene of cookery.\r\n\r\nA little less than ten years ago the Sanitarium at Battle Creek Mich.,\r\nestablished an experimental kitchen and a school of cookery under the\r\nsupervision of Mrs. Dr. Kellogg, since which time, researches in the\r\nvarious lines of cookery and dietetics have been in constant progress in\r\nthe experimental kitchen, and regular sessions of the school of cookery\r\nhave been held. The school has gradually gained in popularity, and the\r\ndemand for instruction has become so great that classes are in session\r\nduring almost the entire year.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, Mrs. Kellogg has had constant oversight of the cuisine\r\nof both the Sanitarium and the Sanitarium Hospital, preparing bills of\r\nfare for the general and diet tables, and supplying constantly new\r\nmethods and original recipes to meet the changing and growing demands of\r\nan institution numbering always from 500 to 700 inmates.\r\n\r\nThese large opportunities for observation, research, and experience,\r\nhave gradually developed a system of cookery, the leading features of\r\nwhich are so entirely novel and so much in advance of the methods\r\nheretofore in use, that it may be justly styled, _A New System of\r\nCookery_. It is a singular and lamentable fact, the evil consequences of\r\nwhich are wide-spread, that the preparation of food, although involving\r\nboth chemical and physical processes, has been less advanced by the\r\nresults of modern researches and discoveries in chemistry and physics,\r\nthan any other department of human industry. Iron mining, glass-making,\r\neven the homely art of brick-making, and many of the operations of the\r\nfarm and the dairy, have been advantageously modified by the results of\r\nthe fruitful labors of modern scientific investigators. But the art of\r\ncookery is at least a century behind in the march of scientific\r\nprogress. The mistress of the kitchen is still groping her way amid the\r\nuncertainties of mediæval methods, and daily bemoaning the sad results\r\nof the \"rule of thumb.\" The chemistry of cookery is as little known to\r\nthe average housewife as were the results of modern chemistry to the old\r\nalchemists; and the attempt to make wholesome, palatable, and\r\nnourishing food by the methods commonly employed, is rarely more\r\nsuccessful than that of those misguided alchemists in transmuting lead\r\nand copper into silver and gold.\r\n\r\nThe new cookery brings order from out the confusion of mixtures and\r\nmesses, often incongruence and incompatible, which surrounds the average\r\ncook, by the elucidation of the principles which govern the operations\r\nof the kitchen, with the same certainty with which the law of gravity\r\nrules the planets.\r\n\r\nThose who have made themselves familiar with Mrs. Kellogg's system of\r\ncookery, invariably express themselves as trebly astonished: first, at\r\nthe simplicity of the methods employed; secondly, at the marvelous\r\nresults both as regards palatableness, wholesomeness, and\r\nattractiveness; thirdly, that it had never occurred to them \"to do this\r\nway before.\"\r\n\r\nThis system does not consist simply of a rehash of what is found in\r\nevery cook book, but of new methods, which are the result of the\r\napplication of the scientific principles of chemistry and physics to the\r\npreparation of food in such a manner as to make it the most nourishing,\r\nthe most digestible, and the most inviting to the eye and to the palate.\r\n\r\nThose who have tested the results of Mrs. Kellogg's system of cookery at\r\nthe Sanitarium tables, or in their own homes through the instruction of\r\nher pupils, have been most enthusiastic in their expressions of\r\nsatisfaction and commendation. Hundreds of original recipes which have\r\nappeared in her department in _Good Health_, \"Science in the Household\",\r\nhave been copied into other journals, and are also quite largely\r\nrepresented in the pages of several cook books which have appeared\r\nwithin the last few years.\r\n\r\nThe great success which attended the cooking school in connection with\r\nthe Bay View Assembly (the Michigan Chautauqua), as well as the uniform\r\nsuccess which has met the efforts of many of the graduates of the\r\nSanitarium school of cookery who have undertaken to introduce the new\r\nsystem through the means of cooking classes in various parts of the\r\nUnited States, has created a demand for a fuller knowledge of the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThis volume is the outgrowth of the practical and experimental work, and\r\nthe popular demand above referred to. Its preparation has occupied the\r\nentire leisure time of the author during the last five or six years. No\r\npains or expense has been spared to render the work authoritative on all\r\nquestions upon which it treats, and in presenting it to the public, the\r\npublishers feel the utmost confidence that the work will meet the\r\nhighest expectations of those who have waited impatiently for its\r\nappearance during the months which have elapsed since its preparation\r\nwas first announced.

eat; and it is no\r\nexaggeration to say that well-selected and scientifically prepared food\r\nrenders the partaker whose digestion permits of its being well\r\nassimilated, superior to his fellow-mortals in those qualities which\r\nwill enable him to cope most successfully with life's difficulties, and\r\nto fulfill the purpose of existence in the best and truest manner. The\r\nbrain and other organs of the body are affected by the quality of the\r\nblood which nourishes them, and since the blood is made of the food\r\neaten, it follows that the use of poor food will result in poor blood,\r\npoor muscles, poor brains, and poor bodies, incapable of first-class\r\nwork in any capacity. Very few persons, however, ever stop to inquire\r\nwhat particular foods are best adapted to the manufacture of good blood\r\nand the maintenance of perfect health; but whatever gratifies the palate\r\nor is most conveniently obtained, is cooked and eaten without regard to\r\nits dietetic value. Far too many meals partake of the characteristics of\r\nthe one described in the story told of a clergyman who, when requested\r\nto ask a blessing upon a dinner consisting of bread, hot and tinged with\r\nsaleratus, meat fried to a crisp, potatoes swimming in grease, mince\r\npie, preserves, and pickles, demurred on the ground that the dinner was\r\n\"not worth a blessing.\" He might with equal propriety have added, \"and\r\nnot worth eating.\"\r\n\r\nThe subject of diet and its relation to human welfare, is one deserving\r\nof the most careful consideration. It should be studied as a science, to\r\nenable us to choose such materials as are best adapted to our needs\r\nunder the varying circumstances of climate growth, occupation, and the\r\nnumerous changing conditions of the human system; as an art, that we may\r\nbecome so skilled in the preparation of the articles selected as to make\r\nthem both appetizing and healthful. It is an unfortunate fact that even\r\namong experienced housekeepers the scientific principles which govern\r\nthe proper preparation of food, are but little understood, and much\r\nunwholesome cookery is the result. The mechanical mixing of ingredients\r\nis not sufficient to secure good results; and many of the failures\r\nattributed to \"poor material,\" \"bad luck,\" and various other subterfuges\r\nto which cooks ignorance of scientific principles. The common method of\r\nblindly following recipes, with no knowledge of \"the reason why,\" can\r\nhardly fail to be often productive of unsatisfactory results, which to\r\nthe uninformed seem quite inexplicable.\r\n\r\nCookery, when based upon scientific principles, ceases to be the\r\ndifficult problem it so often appears. Cause and effect follow each\r\nother as certainly in the preparation of food as in other things; and\r\nwith a knowledge of the underlying principles, and faithfulness in\r\ncarrying out the necessary details, failure becomes almost an\r\nimpossibility. There is no department of human activity where applied\r\nscience offers greater advantages than in that of cookery, and in our\r\npresentation of the subjects treated in the following pages, we have\r\nendeavored, so far as consistent with the scope of this work, to give\r\nspecial prominence to the scientific principles involved in the\r\nsuccessful production of wholesome articles of food. We trust our\r\nreaders will find these principles so plainly elucidated and the subject\r\nso interesting, that they will be stimulated to undertake for\r\nthemselves further study and research in this most important branch of\r\nhousehold science. We have aimed also to give special precedence of\r\nspace to those most important foods, the legumes, and grains and their\r\nproducts, which in the majority of cook books are given but little\r\nconsideration or are even left out altogether, believing that our\r\nreaders will be more interested in learning the many palatable ways in\r\nwhich these especially nutritious and inexpensive foods may be prepared,\r\nthan in a reiteration of such dishes as usually make up the bulk of the\r\naverage cook book.\r\n\r\nFor reasons stated elsewhere (in the chapter on Milk, Cream, and\r\nButter), we have in the preparation of all recipes made use of cream in\r\nplace of other fats; but lest there be some who may suppose because\r\ncream occupies so frequent a place in the recipes, and because of their\r\ninability to obtain that article, the recipes are therefore not adapted\r\nto their use, we wish to state that a large proportion of the recipes in\r\nwhich it is mentioned as seasoning, or for dressing, will be found to be\r\nvery palatable with the cream omitted, or by the use of its place of\r\nsome one of the many substitutes recommended. We ought also to mention\r\nin this connection, that wherever cream is recommended, unless otherwise\r\ndesignated, the quality used in the preparation of the recipes is that\r\nof single or twelve hour cream sufficiently diluted with milk, so that\r\none fourth of each quart of milk is reckoned as cream. If a richer\r\nquality than this be used, the quantity should be diminished in\r\nproportion; otherwise, by the excess of fat, a wholesome food may become\r\na rich, unhealthful dish.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the author desires to state that no recipe has been\r\nadmitted to this work which has not been thoroughly tested by repeated\r\ntrials, by far the larger share of such being original, either in the\r\ncombination of the materials used, the method employed, or both\r\nmaterials and method. Care has been taken not to cumber the work with\r\nuseless and indifferent recipes. It is believed that every recipe will\r\nbe found valuable, and that the variety offered is sufficiently ample,\r\nso that under the most differing circumstances, all may be well served.\r\n\r\nWe trust therefore that those who undertake to use the work as a guide\r\nin their culinary practice, will not consider any given recipe a failure\r\nbecause success does not attend their first efforts. Perseverance and a\r\ncareful study of the directions given, will assuredly bring success to\r\nall who possess the natural or acquired qualities essential for the\r\npractice of that most useful of the arts,--\"Healthful Cookery.\"\r\n\r\nELLA E. KELLOGG.\r\n\r\n_Battle Creek, April 20, 1892._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFoods\r\n\r\nThe purposes of food are to promote growth, to supply force and heat,\r\nand to furnish material to repair the waste which is constantly taking\r\nplace in the body. Every breath, every thought, every motion, wears out\r\nsome portion of the delicate and wonderful house in which we live.\r\nVarious vital processes remove these worn and useless particles; and to\r\nkeep the body in health, their loss must be made good by constantly\r\nrenewed supplies of material properly adapted to replenish the worn and\r\nimpaired tissues. This renovating material must be supplied through the\r\nmedium of food and drink, and the best food is that by which the desired\r\nend may be most readily and perfectly attained. The great diversity in\r\ncharacter of the several tissues of the body, makes it necessary that\r\nfood should contain a variety of elements, in order that each part may\r\nbe properly nourished and replenished.\r\n\r\nTHE FOOD ELEMENTS.--The various elements found in food are the\r\nfollowing: Starch, sugar, fats, albumen, mineral substances,\r\nindigestible substances.\r\n\r\nThe digestible food elements are often grouped, according to their\r\nchemical composition, into three classes; _vis._, carbonaceous,\r\nnitrogenous, and inorganic. The carbonaceous class includes starch,\r\nsugar, and fats; the nitrogenous, all albuminous elements; and the\r\ninorganic comprises the mineral elements.\r\n\r\n_Starch_ is only found in vegetable foods; all grains, most vegetables,\r\nand some fruits, contain starch in abundance. Several kinds of _sugar_\r\nare made in nature's laboratory; _cane_, _grape_, _fruit_, and _milk_\r\nsugar. The first is obtained from the sugar-cane, the sap of maple\r\ntrees, and from the beet root. Grape and fruit sugars are found in most\r\nfruits and in honey. Milk sugar is one of the constituents of milk.\r\nGlucose, an artificial sugar resembling grape sugar, is now largely\r\nmanufactured by subjecting the starch of corn or potatoes to a chemical\r\nprocess; but it lacks the sweetness of natural sugars, and is by no\r\nmeans a proper substitute for them. _Albumen_ is found in its purest,\r\nuncombined state in the white of an egg, which is almost wholly composed\r\nof albumen. It exists, combined with other food elements, in many other\r\nfoods, both animal and vegetable. It is found abundant in oatmeal, and\r\nto some extent in the other grains, and in the juices of vegetables. All\r\nnatural foods contain elements which in many respects resemble\r\n_albumen_, and are so closely allied to it that for convenience they are\r\nusually classified under the general name of \"albumen.\" The chief of\r\nthese is _gluten_, which is found in wheat, rye, and barley. _Casein_,\r\nfound in peas, beans, and milk, and the _fibrin_ of flesh, are elements\r\nof this class.\r\n\r\n_Fats_ are found in both animal and vegetable foods. Of animal fats,\r\nbutter and suet are common examples. In vegetable form, fat is abundant\r\nin nuts, peas, beans, in various of the grains, and in a few fruits, as\r\nthe olive. As furnished by nature in nuts, legumes, grains, fruits, and\r\nmilk, this element is always found in a state of fine subdivision, which\r\ncondition is the one best adapted to its digestion. As most commonly\r\nused, in the form of free fats, as butter, lard, etc., it is not only\r\ndifficult of digestion itself, but often interferes with the digestion\r\nof the other food elements which are mixed with it. It was doubtless\r\nnever intended that fats should be so modified from their natural\r\ncondition and separated from other food elements as to be used as a\r\nseparate article of food. The same may be said of the other carbonaceous\r\nelements, sugar and starch, neither of which, when used alone, is\r\ncapable of sustaining life, although when combined in a proper and\r\nnatural manner with other food elements, they perform a most important\r\npart in the nutrition of the body. Most foods contain a percentage of\r\nthe _mineral_ elements. Grains and milk furnish these elements in\r\nabundance. The cellulose, or woody tissue, of vegetables, and the bran\r\nof wheat, are examples of _indigestible_ elements, which although they\r\ncannot be converted into blood in tissue, serve an important purpose by\r\ngiving bulk to the food.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of gluten, none of the food elements, when used\r\nalone, are capable of supporting life. A true food substance contains\r\nsome of all the food elements, the amount of each varying in different\r\nfoods.\r\n\r\nUSES OF THE FOOD ELEMENTS.--Concerning the purpose which these\r\ndifferent elements serve, it has been demonstrated by the experiments of\r\neminent physiologists that the carbonaceous elements, which in general\r\ncomprise the greater bulk of the food, serve three purposes in the body;\r\n\r\n1. They furnish material for the production of heat;\r\n\r\n2. They are a source of force when taken in connection with other food\r\nelements;\r\n\r\n3. They replenish the fatty tissues of the body. Of the carbonaceous\r\nelements,--starch, sugar, and fats,--fats produce the greatest amount of\r\nheat in proportion to quantity; that is, more heat is developed from a\r\npound of fat than from an equal weight of sugar or starch; but this\r\napparent advantage is more than counterbalanced by the fact that fats\r\nare much more difficult of digestion than are the other carbonaceous\r\nelements, and if relied upon to furnish adequate material for bodily\r\nheat, would be productive of much mischief in overtaxing and producing\r\ndisease of the digestive organs. The fact that nature has made a much\r\nmore ample provision of starch and sugars than of fats in man's natural\r\ndiet, would seem to indicate that they were intended to be the chief\r\nsource of carbonaceous food; nevertheless, fats, when taken in such\r\nproportion as nature supplies them, are necessary and important food\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nThe nitrogenous food elements especially nourish the brain, nerves,\r\nmuscles, and all the more highly vitalized and active tissues of the\r\nbody, and also serve as a stimulus to tissue change. Hence it may be\r\nsaid that a food deficient in these elements is a particularly poor\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nThe inorganic elements, chief of which are the phosphates, in the\r\ncarbonates of potash, soda, and lime, aid in furnishing the requisite\r\nbuilding material for bones and nerves.\r\n\r\nPROPER COMBINATIONS OF FOODS.--While it is important that our food\r\nshould contain some of all the various food elements, experiments upon\r\nboth animals and human beings show it is necessary that these elements,\r\nespecially the nitrogenous and carbonaceous, be used in certain definite\r\nproportions, as the system is only able to appropriate a certain amount\r\nof each; and all excess, especially of nitrogenous elements, is not only\r\nuseless, but even injurious, since to rid the system of the surplus\r\nimposes an additional task upon the digestive and excretory organs. The\r\nrelative proportion of these elements necessary to constitute a food\r\nwhich perfectly meets the requirements of the system, is six of\r\ncarbonaceous to one of nitrogenous. Scientists have devoted much careful\r\nstudy and experimentation to the determination of the quantities of each\r\nof the food elements required for the daily nourishment of individuals\r\nunder the varying conditions of life, and it has come to be commonly\r\naccepted that of the nitrogenous material which should constitute one\r\nsixth of the nutrients taken, about _three ounces_ is all that can be\r\nmade use of in twenty-four hours, by a healthy adult of average weight,\r\ndoing a moderate amount of work. Many articles of food are, however,\r\ndeficient in one or the other of these elements, and need to be\r\nsupplemented by other articles containing the deficient element in\r\nsuperabundance, since to employ a dietary in which any one of the\r\nnutritive elements is lacking, although in bulk it may be all the\r\ndigestive organs can manage, is really starvation, and will in time\r\noccasion serious results.\r\n\r\nIt is thus apparent that much care should be exercised in the selection\r\nand combination of food materials. The table on page 484, showing the\r\nnutritive values of various foods, should be carefully studied. Such\r\nknowledge is of first importance in the education of cooks and\r\nhousekeepers, since to them falls the selection of the food for the\r\ndaily needs of the household; and they should not only understand what\r\nfoods are best suited to supply these needs, but how to combine them in\r\naccordance with physiological laws.\r\n\r\nCONDIMENTS.--By condiments are commonly meant such substances as\r\nare added to season food, to give it \"a relish\" or to stimulate\r\nappetite, but which in themselves possess no real food value. To this\r\ncategory belong mustard, ginger, pepper, pepper sauce, Worcestershire\r\nsauce, cloves, spices, and other similar substances. That anything is\r\nneeded to disguise or improve the natural flavor of food, would seem to\r\nimply either that the article used was not a proper alimentary\r\nsubstance, or that it did not answer the purpose for which the Creator\r\ndesigned it. True condiments, such as pepper, pepper sauce, ginger,\r\nspice, mustard, cinnamon, cloves, etc., are all strong irritants. This\r\nmay be readily demonstrated by their application to a raw surface. The\r\nintense smarting and burning occasioned are ample evidence of the\r\nirritating character. Pepper and mustard are capable of producing\r\npowerfully irritating effects, even when applied to the healthy skin\r\nwhere wholly intact. It is surprising that it does not occur to the\r\nmother who applies a mustard plaster to the feet of her child, to\r\nrelieve congestion of the brain, that an article which is capable of\r\nproducing a blister upon the external covering of the body, is quite as\r\ncapable of producing similar effects when applied to the more sensitive\r\ntissues within the body. The irritating effects of these substances upon\r\nthe stomach are not readily recognized, simply because the stomach is\r\nsupplied with very few nerves of sensation. That condiments induce an\r\nintense degree of irritation of the mucous membrane of the stomach, was\r\nabundantly demonstrated by the experiments of Dr. Beaumont upon the\r\nunfortunate Alexis St. Martin. Dr. Beaumont records that when St. Martin\r\ntook mustard, pepper, and similar condiments with his food, the mucous\r\nmembrane of his stomach became intensely red and congested, appearing\r\nvery much like an inflamed eye. It is this irritating effect of\r\ncondiments which gives occasion for their extended use. They create an\r\nartificial appetite, similar to the incessant craving of the chronic\r\ndyspeptic, whose irritable stomach is seldom satisfied. This fact with\r\nregard to condiments is a sufficient argument against their use, being\r\none of the greatest causes of gluttony, since they remove the sense of\r\nsatiety by which Nature says, \"Enough.\"\r\n\r\nTo a thoroughly normal and unperverted taste, irritating condiments of\r\nall sorts are very obnoxious. It is true that Nature accommodates\r\nherself to their use with food to such a degree that they may be\r\nemployed for years without apparently producing very grave results; but\r\nthis very condition is a source of injury, since it is nothing more nor\r\nless than the going to sleep of the sentinels which nature has posted at\r\nthe portal of the body, for the purpose of giving warning of danger. The\r\nnerves of sensibility have become benumbed to such a degree that they no\r\nlonger offer remonstrance against irritating substances, and allow the\r\nenemy to enter into the citadel of life. The mischievous work is thus\r\ninsidiously carried on year after year until by and by the individual\r\nbreaks down with some chronic disorder of the liver, kidneys, or some\r\nother important internal organ. Physicians have long observed that in\r\ntropical countries where curry powder and other condiments are very\r\nextensively used, diseases of the liver, especially acute congestion and\r\ninflammation, are exceedingly common, much more so that in countries and\r\namong nations where condiments are less freely used. A traveler in\r\nMexico, some time ago, described a favorite Mexican dish as composed of\r\nlayers of the following ingredients: \"Pepper, mustard, ginger, pepper,\r\npotato, ginger; mustard, pepper, potato, mustard, ginger, pepper.\" The\r\ncommon use of such a dish is sufficient cause for the great frequency of\r\ndiseases of the liver among the Mexicans, noted by physicians traveling\r\nin that country. That the use of condiments is wholly a matter of habit\r\nis evident from the fact that different nations employ as condiments\r\narticles which would be in the highest degree obnoxious to people of\r\nother countries. For example, the garlic so freely used in Russian\r\ncookery, would be considered by Americans no addition to the natural\r\nflavors of food; and still more distasteful would be the asafetida\r\nfrequently used as a seasoning in the cuisine of Persia and other\r\nAsiatic countries.\r\n\r\nThe use of condiments is unquestionably a strong auxiliary to the\r\nformation of a habit of using intoxicating drinks. Persons addicted to\r\nthe use of intoxicating liquors are, as a rule, fond of stimulating and\r\nhighly seasoned foods; and although the converse is not always true, yet\r\nit is apparent to every thoughtful person, that the use of a diet\r\ncomposed of highly seasoned and irritating food, institutes the\r\nconditions necessary for the acquirement of a taste for intoxicating\r\nliquors. The false appetite aroused by the use of food that \"burns and\r\nstings,\" craves something less insipid than pure cold water to keep up\r\nthe fever the food has excited. Again, condiments, like all other\r\nstimulants, must be continually increased in quantity, or their effect\r\nbecomes diminished; and this leads directly to a demand for stronger\r\nstimulants, both in eating and drinking, until the probable tendency is\r\ntoward the dram-shop.\r\n\r\nA more serious reason why high seasonings leads to intemperance, is in\r\nthe perversion of the use of the sense of taste. Certain senses are\r\ngiven us to add to our pleasure as well as for the practical, almost\r\nindispensable, use they are to us. For instance, the sense of sight is\r\nnot only useful, but enables us to drink in beauty, if among beautiful\r\nsurroundings, without doing us any harm. The same of music and other\r\nharmonics which may come to us through the sense of hearing. But the\r\nsense of taste and was given us to distinguish between wholesome and\r\nunwholesome foods, and cannot be used for merely sensuous gratification,\r\nwithout debasing and making of it a gross thing. An education which\r\ndemands special enjoyment or pleasure through the sense of taste, is\r\nwholly artificial; it is coming down to the animal plane, or below it\r\nrather; for the instinct of the brute creation teaches it merely to eat\r\nto live.\r\n\r\nYet how wide-spread is this habit of sensuous gratification through the\r\nsense of taste! If one calls upon a neighbor, he is at once offered\r\nrefreshments of some kind, as though the greatest blessing of life came\r\nfrom indulging the appetite. This evil is largely due to wrong\r\neducation, which begins with childhood. When Johnnie sits down to the\r\ntable, the mother says, \"Johnnie, what would you like?\" instead of\r\nputting plain, wholesome food before the child, and taking it as a\r\nmatter of course that he will eat it and be satisfied. The child grows\r\nto think that he must have what he likes, whether it is good for him or\r\nnot. It is not strange that an appetite thus pampered in childhood\r\nbecomes uncontrollable at maturity; for the step from gormandizing to\r\nintoxication is much shorter than most people imagine. The natural,\r\nunperverted taste of a child will lead him to eat that which is good for\r\nhim. But how can we expect the children to reform when the parents\r\ncontinually set them bad examples in the matter of eating and drinking?\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of a taste for spices is a degradation of the sense of\r\ntaste. Nature never designed that pleasure should be divorced from use.\r\nThe effects of gratifying the sense of taste differ materially from\r\nthose of gratifying the higher senses of sight and hearing. What we see\r\nis gone; nothing remains but the memory, and the same is true of the\r\nsweetest sounds which may reach us through the ears. But what we taste\r\nis taken into the stomach and what has thus given us brief pleasure\r\nthrough the gratification of the palate, must make work in the\r\nalimentary canal for fourteen hours before it is disposed of.\r\n\r\nVARIETY IN FOOD.--Simplicity of diet should be a point of first\r\nconsideration with all persons upon whom falls the responsibility of\r\nproviding the family bills of fare, since the simplest foods are, as a\r\nrule, the most healthful. Variety is needed; that is, a judicious\r\nmingling of fruits, grains, and vegetables; but the general tendency is\r\nto supply our tables with too many kinds and to prepare each dish in the\r\nmost elaborate manner, until, in many households, the cooking of food\r\nhas come to be almost the chief end of life. While the preparation of\r\nfood should be looked upon as of so much importance as to demand the\r\nmost careful consideration and thought as to its suitability,\r\nwholesomeness, nutritive qualities, and digestibility, it should by no\r\nmeans be made to usurp the larger share of one's time, when simpler\r\nfoods and less labor would afford the partakers equal nourishment and\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nA great variety of foods at one meal exerts a potent influence in\r\ncreating a love of eating, and is likewise a constant temptation to\r\novereat. Let us have well-cooked, nutritious, and palatable food, and\r\nplenty of it; variety from day to day, but not too great a variety at\r\neach meal.\r\n\r\nThe prevalent custom of loading the table with a great number of viands,\r\nupon occasions when guests are to be entertained in our homes, is one to\r\nbe deplored, since it is neither conducive to good health nor necessary\r\nto good cheer, but on the contrary is still laborious and expensive a\r\npractice that many are debarred from social intercourse because they\r\ncannot afford to entertain after the fashion of their neighbors. Upon\r\nthis subject a well-known writer has aptly said: \"Simplify cookery, thus\r\nreducing the cost of living, and how many longing individuals would\r\nthereby be enabled to afford themselves the pleasure of culture and\r\nsocial intercourse! When the barbarous practice of stuffing one's guests\r\nshall have been abolished, a social gathering will not then imply, as it\r\ndoes now, hard labor, expensive outlay, and dyspepsia. Perhaps when that\r\ntime arise, we shall be sufficiently civilized to demand pleasures of a\r\nhigher sort. True, the entertainments will then, in one sense, be more\r\ncostly, as culture is harder to come by than cake. The profusion of\r\nviands now heaped upon the table, betrays poverty of the worst sort.\r\nHaving nothing better to offer, we offer victuals; and this we do with\r\nsomething of that complacent, satisfied air with which some more\r\nnorthern tribes present their tidbits of whale and walrus.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE TOPICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Let appetite wear reason's golden chain,\r\n    and find in due restrain its luxury.\"\r\n\r\n    A man's food, when he has the means and opportunity of selecting it,\r\n    suggests his moral nature. Many a Christian is trying to do by\r\n    prayer that which cannot be done except through corrected\r\n    diet.--_Talmage._\r\n\r\n    Our pious ancestors enacted a law that suicides should be buried\r\n    where four roads meet, and that a cart-load of stones should be\r\n    thrown upon the body. Yet, when gentlemen or ladies commit suicide,\r\n    not by cord or steel, but by turtle soup or lobster salad, they may\r\n    be buried on consecrated ground, and the public are not ashamed to\r\n    read an epitaph upon their tombstones false enough to make the\r\n    marble blush.--_Horace Mann._\r\n\r\n    It is related by a gentleman who had an appointment to breakfast\r\n    with the late A.T. Stewart, that the butler placed before them both\r\n    an elaborate bill of fare; the visitor selected a list of rare\r\n    dishes, and was quite abashed when Mr. Stewart said, \"Bring me my\r\n    usual breakfast,--oatmeal and boiled eggs.\" He then explained to his\r\n    friend that he found simple food a necessity to him, otherwise he\r\n    could not think clearly. That unobscured brain applied to nobler\r\n    ends would have won higher results, but the principle remains the\r\n    same.--_Sel._\r\n\r\n    Study simplicity in the number of dishes, and a variety in the\r\n    character of the meals.--_Sel._\r\n\r\n    I have come to the conclusion that more than half the disease which\r\n    embitters life is due to avoidable errors in diet, ... and that more\r\n    mischief, in the form of actual disease, of impaired vigor, and of\r\n    shortened life, accrues to civilized man from erroneous habits of\r\n    eating than from the habitual use of alcoholic drink, considerable\r\n    as I know that evil to be.--_Sir Henry Thompson._\r\n\r\n    The ancient Gauls, who were a very brave, strong, and hearty race,\r\n    lived very abstemiously. Their food was milk, berries, and herbs.\r\n    They made bread of nuts. They had a very peculiar fashion of wearing\r\n    a metal ring around the body, the size of which was regulated by act\r\n    of Parliament. Any man who outgrew in circumference his metal ring\r\n    was looked upon as a lazy glutton, and consequently was disgraced.\r\n\r\n     To keep in health this rule is wise:\r\n       Eat only when you need, and relish food,\r\n       chew thoroughly that it may do you good,\r\n     have it well cooked, unspiced, and undisguised.\r\n\r\n    --_Leonardo da Vinci_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIGESTION OF FOODS.\r\n\r\nIt is important that the housekeeper not only understand the nature and\r\ncomposition of foods, but she should also know something of their\r\ndigestive properties, since food, to be serviceable, must be not only\r\nnutritious, but easily digested. Digestion is the process by which food\r\nrendered soluble, and capable of being absorbed for use in carrying on\r\nthe various vital processes.\r\n\r\nThe digestive apparatus consists of a long and tortuous tube called the\r\nalimentary canal, varying in length from twenty-five to thirty feet,\r\nalong which are arranged the various digestive organs,--the mouth, the\r\nstomach, the liver, and the pancreas,--each of which, together with the\r\nintestines, has an important function to perform. In these various\r\norgans nature manufactures five wonderful fluids for changing and\r\ndissolving the several food elements. The mouth supplies the saliva; in\r\nthe walls of the stomach are little glands which produce the gastric\r\njuice; the pancreatic juice is made by the pancreas; the liver secretes\r\nbile; while scattered along the small intestines are minute glands\r\nwhich make the intestinal juice. Each of these fluids has a particular\r\nwork to do in transforming some part of the food into suitable material\r\nfor use in the body. The saliva acts upon the starch of the food,\r\nchanging it into sugar; the gastric juice digests albumin and other\r\nnitrogenous elements; the bile digests fat, and aids in the absorption\r\nof other food elements after they are digested; the pancreatic juice is\r\nnot confined in its action to a single element, but digests starch,\r\nfats, and the albuminous elements after they have been acted upon by the\r\ngastric juice; the intestinal juice is capable of acting upon all\r\ndigestible food elements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Alimentary Canal, _a._ Esophagus; _b._ Stomach; _c._\r\nCardiac Orifice; _d._ Pylorus; _e._ Small Intestine; _f._ Bile Duct;\r\n_g._ Pancreatic Duct; _h._ Ascending Colon; _i._ Transverse Colon; _j._\r\nDescending Colon; _k._ Rectum.]\r\n\r\nTHE DIGESTION OF A MOUTHFUL OF BREAD.--A mouthful of bread\r\nrepresents all, or nearly all, the elements of nutrition. Taking a\r\nmouthful of bread as a representative of food in general, it may be said\r\nthat its digestion begins the moment that it enters the mouth, and\r\ncontinues the entire length of the alimentary canal, or until the\r\ndigestible portion of the food has been completely digested and\r\nabsorbed. We quote the following brief description of the digestive\r\nprocess from Dr. J.H. Kellogg's Second Book in Physiology[A]:--\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Good Health Pub. Co., Battle Creek, Mich.]\r\n\r\n\"_Mastication._--The first act of the digestive process is mastication,\r\nor chewing the food, the purpose of which is to crush the food and\r\ndivide it into small particles, so that the various digestive fluids may\r\neasily and promptly come into contact with every part of it.\r\n\r\n\"_Salivary Digestion._--During the mastication of the food, the salivary\r\nglands are actively pouring out the saliva, which mingles with the food,\r\nand by softening it, aids in its division and prepares it for the action\r\nof the other digestive fluids. It also acts upon the starch, converting\r\na portion of it into grape-sugar.\r\n\r\n\"_Stomach Digestion._--After receiving the food, the stomach soon begins\r\nto pour out the gastric juices, which first makes its appearance in\r\nlittle drops, like beads of sweat upon the face when the perspiration\r\nstarts. As the quantity increases, the drops run together, trickle down\r\nthe side of the stomach, and mingle with the food. The muscular walls of\r\nthe stomach contract upon the food, moving it about with a sort of\r\ncrushing action, thoroughly mixing the gastric juice with the food.\r\nDuring this process both the openings of the stomach are closed tightly.\r\nThe gastric juice softens the food, digests albumen, and coagulates\r\nmilk. The saliva continues its action upon starch for sometime after the\r\nfood reaches the stomach.\r\n\r\n\"After the food has remained in the stomach from one to three hours, or\r\neven longer, if the digestion is slow, or indigestible foods have been\r\neaten, the contractions of the stomach become so vigorous that the more\r\nfluid portions of the food are squeezed out through the pylorus, the\r\nlower orifice of the stomach, thus escaping into the intestine. The\r\npylorus does not exercise any sort of intelligence in the selection of\r\nfood, as was once supposed. The increasing acidity of the contents of\r\nthe stomach causes its muscular walls to contract with increasing\r\nvigor, until finally those portions of the food which may be less\r\nperfectly broken up, but which the stomach has been unable to digest,\r\nare forced through the pylorus.\r\n\r\n\"_Intestinal Digestion._--As it leaves the stomach, the partially\r\ndigested mass of food is intensely acid, from the large quantity of\r\ngastric juices which it contains. Intestinal digestion cannot begin\r\nuntil the food becomes alkaline. The alkaline bile neutralizes the\r\ngastric juice, and renders the digesting mass slightly alkaline. The\r\nbile also acts upon the fatty elements of the food, converting them into\r\nan emulsion. The pancreatic juice converts the starch into grape-sugar,\r\neven acting upon raw starch. It also digest fats and albumem. The\r\nintestinal juice continues the work begun by the other digestive fluids,\r\nand, in addition, digests cane-sugar, converting it into grape-sugar.\r\n\r\n\"_Other Uses of the Digestive Fluids._--In addition to the uses which we\r\nhave already stated, several of the digestive fluids possess other\r\ninteresting properties. The saliva aids the stomach by stimulating its\r\nglands to make gastric juice. The gastric juice and the bile are\r\nexcellent antiseptics, by which the food is preserved from fermentation\r\nwhile undergoing digestion. The bile also stimulates the movements of\r\nthe intestines by which the food is moved along, and aids absorption. It\r\nis remarkable and interesting that a fluid so useful as the bile should\r\nbe at the same time composed of waste matters which are being removed\r\nfrom the body. This is an illustration of the wonderful economy shown by\r\nnature in her operations.\r\n\r\n\"The food is moved along the alimentary canal, from the stomach\r\ndownward, by successive contractions of the muscular walls of the\r\nintestines, known as peristaltic movements, which occur with great\r\nregularity during digestion.\r\n\r\n\"_Absorption_.--The absorption of the food begins as soon as any portion\r\nhas been digested. Even in the mouth and the esophagus a small amount is\r\nabsorbed. The entire mucous membrane lining the digestive canal is\r\nfurnished with a rich supply of blood-vessels, by which the greater part\r\nof the digestive food is absorbed.\r\n\r\n\"_Liver Digestion._--The liver as well as the stomach is a digestive\r\norgan, and in a double sense. It not only secretes a digestive fluid,\r\nthe bile, but it acts upon the food brought to it by the portal vein,\r\nand regulates the supply of digested food to the general system. It\r\nconverts a large share of the grape-sugar and partially digested starch\r\nbrought to it into a kind of liver starch, termed glycogen, which it\r\nstores up in its tissues. During the interval between the meals, the\r\nliver gradually redigests the glycogen, reconverting it into sugar, and\r\nthus supplying it to the blood in small quantities, instead of allowing\r\nthe entire amount formed in digestion to enter the circulation at once.\r\nIf too large an amount of sugar entered the system at once, it would be\r\nunable to use it all, and would be compelled to get rid of a\r\nconsiderable portion through the kidneys. The liver also completes the\r\ndigestion of albumen and other food elements.\"\r\n\r\nTIME REQUIRED FOR DIGESTION.--The length of time required for\r\nstomach digestion varies with different food substances. The following\r\ntable shows the time necessary for the stomach digestion of some of the\r\nmore commonly used foods:--\r\n\r\n                               min\r\n    Rice                       1  00\r\n    Sago                       1  45\r\n    Tapioca                    2  00\r\n    Barley                     2  00\r\n    Beans, pod, boiled         2  30\r\n    Bread, wheaten             3  30\r\n    Bread, corn                3  15\r\n    Apples, sour and raw       2  00\r\n    Apples, sweet and raw      1  30\r\n    Parsnips, boiled           2  30\r\n    Beets, boiled              3  45\r\n    Potatoes, Irish, boiled    3  30\r\n    Potatoes, Irish, baked     2  30\r\n    Cabbage, raw               2  30\r\n    Cabbage, boiled            4  30\r\n    Milk, boiled               2  00\r\n    Milk, raw                  2  15\r\n    Eggs, hard boiled          3  30\r\n    Eggs, soft boiled          3  00\r\n    Eggs, fried                3  30\r\n    Eggs, raw                  2  00\r\n    Eggs, whipped              1  30\r\n    Salmon, salted, boiled     4  00\r\n    Oysters, raw               2  55\r\n    Oysters, stewed            3  30\r\n    Beef, lean, rare roasted   3  00\r\n    Beefsteak, boiled          3  00\r\n    Beef, lean, fried          4  00\r\n    Beef, salted, boiled       4  15\r\n    Pork, roasted              5  15\r\n    Pork, salted, fried        4  15\r\n    Mutton, roasted            3  15\r\n    Mutton, broiled            3  00\r\n    Veal, broiled              4  00\r\n    Veal, fried                4  30\r\n    Fowls, boiled              4  00\r\n    Duck, roasted              4  30\r\n    Butter, melted             3  30\r\n    Cheese                     3  30\r\n    Soup, marrowbone           4  15\r\n    Soup, bean                 3  00\r\n    Soup, mutton               3  30\r\n    Chicken, boiled            3  00\r\n\r\nThe time required for the digestion of food also depends upon the\r\ncondition under which the food is eaten. Healthy stomach digestion\r\nrequires at least five hours for its completion, and the stomach should\r\nhave an hour for rest before another meal. If fresh food is taken before\r\nthat which preceded it is digested, the portion of food remaining in the\r\nstomach is likely to undergo fermentation, thus rendering the whole mass\r\nof food unfit for the nutrition of the body, besides fostering various\r\ndisturbances of digestion. It has been shown by recent observations that\r\nthe length of time required for food to pass through the entire\r\ndigestive process to which it is subjected in the mouth, stomach, and\r\nsmall intestines, is from twelve to fourteen hours.\r\n\r\nHYGIENE OF DIGESTION.--With the stomach and other digestive organs\r\nin a state of perfect health, one is entirely unconscious of their\r\nexistence, save when of feeling of hunger calls attention to the fact\r\nthat food is required, or satiety warns us that a sufficient amount or\r\ntoo much has been eaten. Perfect digestion can only be maintained by\r\ncareful observance of the rules of health in regard to habits of eating.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of Hygiene of Digestion, we again quote a few paragraphs\r\nfrom Dr. Kellogg's work on Physiology, in which is given a concise\r\nsummary of the more important points relating to this:--\r\n\r\n\"The hygiene of digestion has to do with the quality and quantity of\r\nfood eaten, in the manner of eating it.\r\n\r\n\"_Hasty Eating._--If the food is eaten too rapidly, it will not be\r\nproperly divided, and when swallowed in coarse lumps, the digestive\r\nfluids cannot readily act upon it. On account of the insufficient\r\nmastication, the saliva will be deficient in quantity, and, as a\r\nconsequence, the starch will not be well digested, and the stomach will\r\nnot secrete a sufficient amount of gastric juice. It is not well to eat\r\nonly soft or liquid food, as we are likely to swallow it without proper\r\nchewing. A considerable proportion of hard food, which requires thorough\r\nmastication, should be eaten at every meal.\r\n\r\n\"_Drinking Freely at Meals_ is harmful, as it not only encourages hasty\r\neating, but dilutes the gastric juice, and thus lessens its activity.\r\nThe food should be chewed until sufficiently moistened by saliva to\r\nallow it to be swallowed. When large quantities of fluid are taken into\r\nthe stomach, digestion does not begin until a considerable portion of\r\nthe fluid has been absorbed. If cold foods or drinks are taken with the\r\nmeal, such as ice-cream, ice-water, iced milk or tea, the stomach is\r\nchilled, and a long delay in the digestive process is occasioned.\r\n\r\n\"The Indians of Brazil carefully abstain from drinking when eating, and\r\nthe same custom prevails among many other savage tribes.\r\n\r\n\"_Eating between Meals._--The habit of eating apples, nuts, fruits,\r\nconfectionery, etc., between meals is exceedingly harmful, and certain\r\nto produce loss of appetite and indigestion. The stomach as well as the\r\nmuscles and other organs of the body requires rest. The frequency with\r\nwhich meals should be taken depends somewhat upon the age and occupation\r\nof an individual. Infants take their food at short intervals, and owing\r\nto its simple character, are able to digest it very quickly. Adults\r\nshould not take food oftener than three times a day; and persons whose\r\nemployment is sedentary say, in many cases at least, adopt with\r\nadvantage the plan of the ancient Greeks, who ate but twice a day. The\r\nlatter custom is quite general among the higher classes in France and\r\nSpain, and in several South American countries.\r\n\r\n\"_Simplicity in Diet._--Taking too many kinds of food at a meal is a\r\ncommon fault which is often a cause of disease of the digestive-organs.\r\nThose nations are the most hardy and enduring whose dietary is most\r\nsimple. The Scotch peasantry live chiefly upon oatmeal, the Irish upon\r\npotatoes, milk, and oatmeal, the Italian upon peas, beans, macaroni, and\r\nchestnuts; yet all these are noted for remarkable health and endurance.\r\nThe natives of the Canary Islands, an exceedingly well-developed and\r\nvigorous race, subsist almost chiefly upon a food which they call\r\ngofio, consisting of parched grain, coarsely ground in a mortar and\r\nmixed with water.\r\n\r\n\"_Eating when Tired._--It is not well to eat when exhausted by violent\r\nexercise, as the system is not prepared to do the work of digestion\r\nwell. Sleeping immediately after eating is also a harmful practice. The\r\nprocess of digestion cannot well be performed during sleep, and sleep is\r\ndisturbed by the ineffective efforts of the digestive organs. Hence the\r\nwell-known evil effects of late suppers.\r\n\r\n\"_Eating too Much._--Hasty eating is the greatest cause of over-eating.\r\nWhen one eats too rapidly, the food is crowded into the stomach so fast\r\nthat nature has no time to cry, 'Enough,' by taking away the appetite\r\nbefore too much has been eaten. When an excess of food is taken, it is\r\nlikely to ferment or sour before it can be digested. One who eats too\r\nmuch usually feels dull after eating.\r\n\r\n\"_How Much Food is Enough?_--The proper quantity for each person to take\r\nis what he is able to digest and utilize. This amount of various with\r\neach individual, at different times. The amount needed will vary with\r\nthe amount of work done, mental or muscular; with the weather or the\r\nseason of the year, more food being required in cold than in warm\r\nweather: with the age of an individual, very old and very young persons\r\nrequiring less food than those of middle age. An unperverted appetite,\r\nnot artificially stimulated, is a safe guide. Drowsiness, dullness, and\r\nheaviness at the stomach are indications of an excess of eating, and\r\nnaturally suggest a lessening of the quantity of food, unless the\r\nsymptoms are known to arise from some other cause.\r\n\r\n\"_Excess of Certain Food Elements._--When sugar is too freely used,\r\neither with food or in the form of sweetmeats or candies, indigestion,\r\nand even more serious disease, is likely to result. Fats, when freely\r\nused, give rise to indigestion and 'biliousness.' An excess of albumen\r\nfrom the too free use of meat is harmful. Only a limited amount of this\r\nelement can be used; an excess is treated as waste matter, and must be\r\nremoved from the system by the liver and the kidneys. The majority of\r\npersons would enjoy better health by using meat more moderately than is\r\ncustomary in this country.\r\n\r\n\"_Deficiency of Certain Food Elements._--A diet deficient in any\r\nimportant food element is even more detrimental to health than a diet in\r\nwhich certain elements are in excess.\r\n\r\n\"The popular notion that beef-tea and meat extracts contain the\r\nnourishing elements of meat in a concentrated form, is a dangerous\r\nerror. Undoubtedly many sick persons have been starved by being fed\r\nexclusively upon these articles, which are almost wholly composed of\r\nwaste substances. Prof. Paule Bernard, of Paris, found that dogs fed\r\nupon meat extracts died sooner than those which received only water.\"\r\n\r\nFOOD COMBINATIONS.--Some persons, especially those of weak\r\ndigestive powers, often experience inconvenience in the use of certain\r\nfoods, owing to their improper combinations with other articles. Many\r\nfoods which are digested easily when partaken of alone or in harmonious\r\ncombinations, create much disturbance when eaten at the same meal with\r\nseveral different articles of food, or with some particular article with\r\nwhich they are especially incompatible. The following food combinations\r\nare among the best, the relative excellence of each being indicated by\r\nthe order in which they are named: Milk and grains; grains and eggs;\r\ngrains and vegetables or meats; grains and fruits.\r\n\r\nPersons with sound stomachs and vigorous digestion will seldom\r\nexperience inconvenience in making use of other and more varied\r\ncombinations, but dyspeptics and persons troubled with slow digestion\r\nwill find it to their advantage to select from the bill of fare such\r\narticles as best accord with each other, and to avoid such combinations\r\nas fruits and vegetables, milk and vegetables, milk and meats, sugar and\r\nmilk, meat or vegetables, fats with fruits, meats, or vegetables, or\r\ncooked with grains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE TOPICS.\r\n\r\n    Now good digestion waits on appetite, and health on\r\n    both--_Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n    We live not upon what we eat, but upon what we digest.--_Abernethy._\r\n\r\n    If we consider the amount of ill temper, despondency, and general\r\n    unhappiness which arises from want of proper digestion and\r\n    assimilation of our food, it seems obviously well worth while to put\r\n    forth every effort, and undergo any sacrifice, for the purpose of\r\n    avoiding indigestion, with its resulting bodily ills; and yet year\r\n    after year, from the cradle to the grave, we go on violating the\r\n    plainest and simplest laws of health at the temptation of Cooks,\r\n    caterers, and confectioners, whose share in shortening the average\r\n    term of human life is probably nearly equal to that of the combined\r\n    armies and navies of the world.--_Richardson._\r\n\r\n    Almost every human malady is connected, either by highway or byway,\r\n    with the stomach.--_Sir Francis Head._\r\n\r\n    It is a well-established fact that a leg of mutton caused a\r\n    revolution in the affairs of Europe. Just before the battle of\r\n    Leipsic, Napoleon the Great insisted on dining on boiled mutton,\r\n    although his physicians warned him that it would disagree with him.\r\n    The emperor's brain resented the liberty taken with its colleague,\r\n    the stomach; the monarch's equilibrium was overturned, the battle\r\n    lost, and a new page opened in history.--_Sel._\r\n\r\n    Galloping consumption at the dinner table is one of the national\r\n    disorders.--_Sel._\r\n\r\n    The kitchen (that is, your stomach) being out of order, the garret\r\n    (the head) cannot be right, and every room in the house becomes\r\n    affected. Remedy the evil in the kitchen, and all will be right in\r\n    parlor and chamber. If you put improper food into the stomach, you\r\n    play the mischief with it, and with the whole machine\r\n    besides.--_Abernethy._\r\n\r\n    Cattle know when to go home from grazing, but a foolish man never\r\n    knows his stomachs measures.--_Scandinavian proverb._\r\n\r\n    Enough is as good as a feast.\r\n\r\n    Simplicity of diet is the characteristic of the dwellers in the\r\n    Orient. According to Niebuhr, the sheik of the desert wants only a\r\n    dish of pillau, or boiled rice, which he eats without fork or spoon.\r\n    Notwithstanding their frugal fare, these sons of the desert are\r\n    among the most hearty and enduring of all members of the human\r\n    family. A traveler tells of seeing one of them run up to the top of\r\n    the tallest pyramid and back in six minutes.\r\n\r\n    One fourth of what we eat keeps us, and the other three fourths we\r\n    keep at the peril of our lives.--_Abernethy._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOOKERY.\r\n\r\nIt is not enough that good and proper food material be provided; it must\r\nhave such preparation as will increase and not diminish its alimentary\r\nvalue. The unwholesomeness of food is quite as often due to bad cookery\r\nas to improper selection of material. Proper cookery renders good food\r\nmaterial more digestible. When scientifically done, cooking changes each\r\nof the food elements, with the exception of fats, in much the same\r\nmanner as do the digestive juices, and at the same time it breaks up the\r\nfood by dissolving the soluble portions, so that its elements are more\r\nreadily acted upon by the digestive fluids. Cookery, however, often\r\nfails to attain the desired end; and the best material is rendered\r\nuseless and unwholesome by a improper preparation.\r\n\r\nIt is rare to find a table, some portion of the food upon which is not\r\nrendered unwholesome either by improper preparatory treatment, or by the\r\naddition of some deleterious substance. This is doubtless due to the\r\nfact that the preparation of food being such a commonplace matter, its\r\nimportant relations to health, mind, and body have been overlooked, and\r\nit has been regarded as a menial service which might be undertaken with\r\nlittle or no preparation, and without attention to matters other than\r\nthose which relate to the pleasure of the eye and the palate. With taste\r\nonly as a criterion, it is so easy to disguise the results of careless\r\nand improper cookery of food by the use of flavors and condiments, as\r\nwell as to palm off upon the digestive organs all sorts of inferior\r\nmaterial, that poor cookery has come to be the rule rather than the\r\nexception.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for this prevalence of bad cookery, is to be found in the\r\nfact that in so many homes the cooking is intrusted to an ignorant class\r\nof persons having no knowledge whatever of the scientific principles\r\ninvolved in this most important and practical of arts. An ethical\r\nproblem which we have been unable to solve is the fact that women who\r\nwould never think of trusting the care of their fine china and\r\nbric-a-brac to unskilled hands, unhesitatingly intrust to persons who\r\nare almost wholly untrained, the preparation of their daily food. There\r\nis no department of life where superior intelligence is more needed than\r\nin the selection and preparation of food, upon which so largely depend\r\nthe health and physical welfare of the family circle.\r\n\r\nThe evils of bad cookery and ill-selected food are manifold, so many, in\r\nfact, that it has been calculated that they far exceed the mischief\r\narising from the use of strong drink; indeed, one of the evils of\r\nunwholesome food is its decided tendency to create a craving for\r\nintoxicants. Bad cookery causes indigestion, indigestion causes thirst,\r\nand thirst perpetuates drunkenness. Any one who has suffered from a fit\r\nof indigestion, and can recollect the accompanying headache and the\r\nlowness of spirits, varying in degree from dejection or ill-humor to the\r\nmost extreme melancholy, until the intellectual faculties seemed dazed,\r\nand the moral feelings blunted, will hardly wonder that when such a\r\ncondition becomes chronic, as is often the case from the use of\r\nimproperly prepared food, the victim is easily led to resort to\r\nstimulants to drown depression and enliven the spirits.\r\n\r\nA thorough practical knowledge of simple, wholesome cookery ought to\r\nform a part of the education of every young woman, whatever her station\r\nin life. No position in life is more responsible than that of the person\r\nwho arranges the bills of fare and selects the food for the household;\r\nand what higher mission can one conceive than to intelligently prepare\r\nthe wherewithal to make shoulders strong to bear life's burdens and\r\nheads clear to solve its intricate problems? what worthier work than to\r\nhelp in the building up of bodies into pure temples fit for guests of\r\nnoble thoughts and high purposes? Surely, no one should undertake such\r\nimportant work without a knowledge of the principles involved.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENTIFIC COOKERY.\r\n\r\nCookery is the art of preparing food for the table by dressing, or by\r\nthe application of heat in some manner.\r\n\r\nFUELS.--Artificial heat is commonly produced by combustion, caused\r\nby the chemical action of the oxygen of the air upon the hydrogen and\r\ncarbon found in fuel. The different fuels in common use for cooking\r\npurposes are hard wood, soft wood, charcoal, anthracite coal, bituminous\r\ncoal, coke, lignite, kerosene oil, gasoline, and gas. As to their\r\nrespective values, much depends upon the purpose for which they are to\r\nbe used. Wood charcoal produces a greater amount of heat than an equal\r\nweight of any other fuel. Soft wood burns quicker and gives a more\r\nintense heat than hard wood, and hence is best for a quick fire. Hard\r\nwood burns slowly, produces a larger mass of coals, and is best where\r\nlong-continued heat is desired. Anthracite coal kindles slowly, and\r\nburns with little flame or smoke, but its vapor is sulphurous, and on\r\nthat account it should never be burned in an open stove, nor in one with\r\nan imperfect draft. Its heat is steady and intense. Bituminous coal\r\nignites readily, burns with considerable flame and smoke, and gives a\r\nmuch less intense heat than anthracite, Lignite, or brown coal, is much\r\nless valuable as fuel. Coke is useful when a short, quick fire is\r\nneeded. Kerosene and gas are convenient and economical fuels.\r\n\r\nMAKING FIRES.--If coal is the fuel to be used, first clean out the\r\nstove by shaking the grate and removing all ashes and cinders. Remove\r\nthe stove covers, and brush the soot and ashes out of all the flues and\r\ndraft holes into the fire-box. Place a large handful of shavings or\r\nloosely twisted or crumpled papers upon the grate, over which lay some\r\nfine pieces of dry kindling-wood, arranged crosswise to permit a free\r\ndraft, then a few sticks of hard wood, so placed as to allow plenty of\r\nair spaces. Be sure that the wood extends out to both ends of the\r\nfire-box. Replace the covers, and if the stove needs blacking, mix the\r\npolish, and apply it, rubbing with a dry brush until nearly dry, then\r\nlight the fuel, as a little heat will facilitate the polishing. When the\r\nwood is burning briskly, place a shovelful or two of rather small pieces\r\nof coal upon the wood, and, as they ignite, gradually add more, until\r\nthere is a clear, bright body of fire, remembering, however, never to\r\nfill the stove above the fire bricks; then partly close the direct\r\ndraft. When wood or soft coal is used, the fuel may be added at the same\r\ntime with the kindling.\r\n\r\nCARE OF FIRES.--Much fuel is wasted through the loss of heat from\r\ntoo much draft. Only just enough air should be supplied to promote\r\ncombustion. A coal fire, when well kindled, needs only air enough to\r\nkeep it burning. When the coal becomes red all through, it has parted\r\nwith the most of its heat, and the fire will soon die unless\r\nreplenished. To keep a steady fire, add but a small amount of fuel at a\r\ntime, and repeat often enough to prevent any sensible decrease of the\r\ndegree of heat. Rake the fire from the bottom, and keep it clear of\r\nashes and cinders. If a very hot fire is needed, open the drafts; at\r\nother times, keep them closed, or partially so, and not waste fuel.\r\nThere is no economy in allowing a fire to get low before fuel is added;\r\nfor the fresh fuel cools the fire to a temperature so low that it is not\r\nuseful, and thus occasions a direct waste of all fuel necessary to again\r\nraise the heat to the proper degree, to say nothing of the waste of time\r\nand patience. The addition of small quantities of fuel at short\r\nintervals so long as continuous heat is needed, is far better than to\r\nlet the fuel burn nearly out, and then add a larger quantity. The\r\nimproper management of the drafts and dampers has also much to do with\r\nwaste of fuel. As stoves are generally constructed, it is necessary for\r\nthe heat to pass over the top, down the back, and under the bottom of\r\nthe oven before escaping into the flue, in order to properly heat the\r\noven for baking. In order to force the heat to make this circuit, the\r\ndirect draft of the stove needs to be closed. With this precaution\r\nobserved, a quick fire from a small amount of fuel, used before its\r\nforce is spent, will produce better results than a fire-box full under\r\nother circumstances.\r\n\r\nAn item of economy for those who are large users of coal, is the careful\r\nsifting of the cinders from the ashes. They can be used to good\r\nadvantage to put first upon the kindlings, when building the fire, as\r\nthey ignite more readily than fresh coal, and give a greater, quicker\r\nheat, although much less enduring.\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF COOKING.--A proper source of heat having been secured,\r\nthe next step is to apply it to the food in some manner. The principal\r\nmethods commonly employed are roasting, broiling, baking, boiling,\r\nstewing, simmering, steaming, and frying.\r\n\r\n_Roasting_ is cooking food in its own juices before an open fire. A\r\nclear fire with intense heat is necessary.\r\n\r\n_Broiling_, or _grilling_, is cooking by radiant heat over glowing\r\ncoals. This method is only adapted to thin pieces of food with a\r\nconsiderable amount of surface. Larger and more compact foods should be\r\nroasted or baked. Roasting and broiling are allied in principle. In\r\nboth, the work is chiefly done by the radiation of heat directly upon\r\nthe surface of the food, although some heat is communicated by the hot\r\nair surrounding the food. The intense heat applied to the food soon\r\nsears its outer surfaces, and thus prevents the escape of its juices. If\r\ncare be taken frequently to turn the food so that its entire surface\r\nwill be thus acted upon, the interior of the mass is cooked by its own\r\njuices.\r\n\r\n_Baking_ is the cooking of food by dry heat in a closed oven. Only foods\r\ncontaining a considerable degree of moisture are adapted for cooking by\r\nthis method. The hot, dry air which fills the oven is always thirsting\r\nfor moisture, and will take from every moist substance to which it has\r\naccess a quantity of water proportionate to its degree of heat. Foods\r\ncontaining but a small amount of moisture, unless protected in some\r\nmanner from the action of the heated air, or in some way supplied with\r\nmoisture during the cooking process, come from the oven dry, hard, and\r\nunpalatable.\r\n\r\nProper cooking by this method depends greatly upon the facility with\r\nwhich the heat of the oven can be regulated. When oil or gas is the fuel\r\nused, it is an easy matter to secure and maintain almost any degree of\r\nheat desirable, but with a wood or coal stove, especial care and\r\npainstaking are necessary.\r\n\r\nIt is of the first importance that the mechanism of the oven to be used,\r\nbe thoroughly understood by the cook, and she should test its heating\r\ncapacity under various conditions, with a light, quick fire and with a\r\nmore steady one; she should carefully note the kind and amount of fuel\r\nrequisite to produce a certain degree of heat; in short, she should\r\nthoroughly know her \"machine\" and its capabilities before attempting to\r\nuse it for the cooking of food. An oven thermometer is of the utmost\r\nvalue for testing the heat, but unfortunately, such thermometers are not\r\ncommon. They are obtainable in England, although quite expensive. It is\r\nalso possible at the present time to obtain ranges with a very reliable\r\nthermometer attachment to the oven door.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Oven Thermometer]\r\n\r\nA cook of good judgment by careful observation and comparison of\r\nresults, can soon learn to form quite a correct idea of the heat of her\r\noven by the length of time she can hold her hand inside it without\r\ndiscomfort, but since much depends upon the construction of stoves and\r\nthe kind of fuel used, and since the degree of heat bearable will vary\r\nwith every hand that tries it, each person who depends upon this test\r\nmust make her own standard. When the heat of the oven is found to be too\r\ngreat, it may be lessened by placing in it a dish of cold water.\r\n\r\n_Boiling_ is the cooking of food in a boiling liquid. Water is the usual\r\nmedium employed for this purpose. When water is heated, as its\r\ntemperature is increased, minute bubbles of air which have been\r\ndissolved by it are given off. As the temperature rises, bubbles of\r\nsteam will begin to form at the bottom of the vessel. At first these\r\nwill be condensed as they rise into the cooler water above, causing a\r\nsimmering sound; but as the heat increases, the bubbles will rise higher\r\nand higher before collapsing, and in a short time will pass entirely\r\nthrough the water, escaping from its surface, causing more or less\r\nagitation, according to the rapidity with which they are formed. Water\r\nboils when the bubbles thus rise to the surface, and steam is thrown\r\noff. If the temperature is now tested, it will be found to be about 212°\r\nF. When water begins to boil, it is impossible to increase its\r\ntemperature, as the steam carries off the heat as rapidly as it is\r\ncommunicated to the water. The only way in which the temperature can be\r\nraised, is by the confinement of the steam; but owing to its enormous\r\nexpansive force, this is not practicable with ordinary cooking utensils.\r\nThe mechanical action of the water is increased by rapid bubbling, but\r\nnot the heat; and to boil anything violently does not expedite the\r\ncooking process, save that by the mechanical action of the water the\r\nfood is broken into smaller pieces, which are for this reason more\r\nreadily softened. But violent boiling occasions an enormous waste of\r\nfuel, and by driving away in the steam the volatile and savory elements\r\nof the food, renders it much less palatable, if not altogether\r\ntasteless. The solvent properties of water are so increased by heat that\r\nit permeates the food, rendering its hard and tough constituents soft\r\nand easy of digestion.\r\n\r\nThe liquids mostly employed in the cooking of foods are water and milk.\r\nWater is best suited for the cooking of most foods, but for such\r\nfarinaceous foods as rice, macaroni, and farina, milk, or at least part\r\nmilk, is preferable, as it adds to their nutritive value. In using milk\r\nfor cooking purposes, it should be remembered that being more dense than\r\nwater, when heated, less steam escapes, and consequently it boils sooner\r\nthan does water. Then, too, milk being more dense, when it is used alone\r\nfor cooking, a little larger quantity of fluid will be required than\r\nwhen water is used.\r\n\r\nThe boiling point for water at the sea level is 212°. At all points\r\nabove the sea level, water boils at a temperature below 212°, the exact\r\ntemperature depending upon the altitude. At the top of Mt. Blanc, an\r\naltitude of 15,000 feet, water boils at 185°. The boiling point is\r\nlowered one degree for every 600 feet increase in altitude. The boiling\r\npoint may be increased by adding soluble substances to the water. A\r\nsaturated solution of common baking soda boils at 220°. A saturated\r\nsolution of chloride of sodium boils at 227°. A similar solution of\r\nsal-ammoniac boils at 238°. Of course such solutions cannot be used\r\nadvantageously, except as a means of cooking articles placed in\r\nhermetically sealed vessels and immersed in the liquid.\r\n\r\nDifferent effects upon food are produced by the use of hard and soft\r\nwater. Peas and beans boiled in hard water containing lime or gypsum,\r\nwill not become tender, because these chemical substances harden\r\nvegetable casein, of which element peas and beans are largely composed.\r\nFor extracting the juices of meat and the soluble parts of other foods,\r\nsoft water is best, as it more readily penetrates the tissue; but when\r\nit is desired to preserve the articles whole, and retain their juices\r\nand flavors, hard water is preferable.\r\n\r\nFoods should be put to cook in cold or boiling water, in accordance with\r\nthe object to be attained in their cooking. Foods from which it is\r\ndesirable to extract the nutrient properties, as for broths, extracts,\r\netc., should be put to cook in cold water. Foods to be kept intact as\r\nnearly as may be, should be put to cook in boiling water.\r\n\r\nHot and cold water act differently upon the different food elements.\r\nStarch is but slightly acted upon by cold water. When starch is added\r\nto several times its bulk of hot water, all the starch granules burst on\r\napproaching the boiling point, and swell to such a degree as to occupy\r\nnearly the whole volume of the water, forming a pasty mess. Sugar is\r\ndissolved readily in the either hot or cold water. Cold water extracts\r\nalbumen. Hot water coagulates it.\r\n\r\n_Steaming_, as its name implies, is the cooking of food by the use of\r\nsteam. There are several ways of steaming, the most common of which is\r\nby placing the food in a perforated dish over a vessel of boiling water.\r\nFor foods not needing the solvent powers of water, or which already\r\ncontain a large amount of moisture, this method is preferable to\r\nboiling. Another form of cooking, which is usually termed steaming, is\r\nthat of placing the food, with or without water, as needed, in a closed\r\nvessel which is placed inside another vessel containing boiling water.\r\nSuch an apparatus is termed a double boiler. Food cooked in its own\r\njuices in a covered dish in a hot oven, is sometimes spoken of as being\r\n_steamed_ or _smothered_.\r\n\r\n_Stewing_ is the prolonged cooking of food in a small quantity of\r\nliquid, the temperature of which is just below the boiling point.\r\nStewing should not be confounded with simmering, which is slow, steady\r\nboiling. The proper temperature for stewing is most easily secured by\r\nthe use of the double boiler. The water in the outer vessel boils, while\r\nthat in the inner vessel does not, being kept a little below the\r\ntemperature of the water from which its heat is obtained, by the\r\nconstant evaporation at a temperature a little below the boiling point.\r\n\r\n_Frying_, which is the cooking of food in hot fat, is a method not to be\r\nrecommended--Unlike all the other food elements, fat is rendered less\r\ndigestible by cooking. Doubtless it is for this reason that nature has\r\nprovided those foods which require the most prolonged cooking to fit\r\nthem for use with only a small proportion of fat, and it would seem to\r\nindicate that any food to be subjected to a high degree of heat should\r\nnot be mixed and compounded largely of fats. The ordinary way of frying,\r\nwhich the French call _sauteing_, is by the use of only a little fat in\r\na shallow pan, into which the food is put and cooked first on one side\r\nand then the other. Scarcely anything could be more unwholesome than\r\nfood prepared in this manner. A morsel of food encrusted with fat\r\nremains undigested in the stomach because fat is not acted upon by the\r\ngastric juice, and its combination with the other food elements of which\r\nthe morsel is composed interferes with their digestion also. If such\r\nfoods are habitually used, digestion soon becomes slow and the gastric\r\njuice so deficient in quantity that fermentation and putrefactive\r\nchanges are occasioned, resulting in serious disturbance of health. In\r\nthe process of frying, the action of the heat partially decomposes the\r\nfat; in consequence, various poisonous substances are formed, highly\r\ndetrimental to the digestion of the partaker of the food.\r\n\r\nADDING FOODS TO BOILING LIQUIDS.--Much of the soddenness of\r\nimproperly cooked foods might be avoided, if the following facts were\r\nkept in mind:--\r\n\r\nWhen vegetables, or other foods of ordinary temperature, are put into\r\nboiling water, the temperature of the water is lowered in proportion to\r\nthe quantity and the temperature of the food thus introduced, and will\r\nnot again boil until the mass of food shall have absorbed more heat from\r\nthe fire. The result of this is that the food is apt to become more or\r\nless water-soaked before the process of cooking begins. This difficulty\r\nmay be avoided by introducing but small quantities of the food at one\r\ntime, so as not to greatly lower the temperature of the liquid, and then\r\nallowing the latter to boil between the introduction of each fresh\r\nsupply, or by heating the food before adding it to the liquid.\r\n\r\nEVAPORATION is another principle often overlooked in the cooking of\r\nfood, and many a sauce or gravy is spoiled because the liquid, heated in\r\na shallow pan, from which evaporation is rapid, loses so much in bulk\r\nthat the amount of thickening requisite for the given quantity of fluid,\r\nand which, had less evaporation occurred, would have made it of the\r\nproper consistency, makes the sauce thick and unpalatable. Evaporation\r\nis much less, in slow boiling, than in more rapid cooking.\r\n\r\nMEASURING.--One of the most important principles to be observed in\r\nthe preparation of food for cooking, is accuracy in measuring. Many an\r\nexcellent recipe proves a failure simply from lack of care in this\r\nrespect. Measures are generally more convenient than weights, and are\r\nmore commonly used. The common kitchen cup, which holds a half pint, is\r\nthe one usually taken as the standard; if any other size is used, the\r\ningredients for the entire recipe should be measured by the same. The\r\nfollowing points should be observed in measuring:--\r\n\r\n1. The teaspoons and tablespoons to be used in measuring, are the silver\r\nspoons in general use.\r\n\r\n2. Any material like flour, sugar, salt, that has been packed, should\r\neither be sifted or stirred up lightly before measuring.\r\n\r\n3. A cupful of dry material is measured level with the top of the cup,\r\nwithout being packed down.\r\n\r\n4. A cupful of liquid is all the cup will contain without running over.\r\nHold the cup in a saucer while measuring, to prevent spilling the liquid\r\nupon the floor or table.\r\n\r\nCOMPARATIVE TABLE OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.--The following\r\ncomparative table of weights and measurements will aid in estimating\r\ndifferent materials:--\r\n\r\nOne heaping tablespoonful of sugar weighs one ounce.\r\n\r\nTwo round tablespoonfuls of flour weigh one ounce.\r\n\r\nTwo cupfuls of granulated sugar weigh one pound.\r\n\r\nTwo cupfuls of meal weigh one pound.\r\n\r\nFour cupfuls of sifted flour weigh one pound.\r\n\r\nOne pint of oatmeal, cracked wheat, or other coarse grains, weighs about\r\none pound.\r\n\r\nOne pint of liquid weighs one pound.\r\n\r\nOne pint of meat chopped and packed solid weighs one pound.\r\n\r\nSeven heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar = one cupful.\r\n\r\nFive heaping tablespoonfuls of flour = one cupful.\r\n\r\nTwo cupfuls of liquid or dry material = one pint\r\n\r\nFour cupfuls of liquid or dry material = one quart.\r\n\r\nMIXING MATERIALS.--In the compounding of recipes, various modes are\r\nemployed for mingling together the different ingredients, chief of which\r\nare _stirring_, _beating_, and _kneading_.\r\n\r\nBy _stirring_ is meant a continuous motion round and round with a spoon,\r\nwithout lifting it from the mixture, except to scrape occasionally from\r\nthe sides of the dish any portion of the material that may cling to it.\r\nIt is not necessary that the stirring should be all in one direction, as\r\nmany cooks suppose. The object of the stirring is to thoroughly blend\r\nthe ingredients, and this may be accomplished as well by stirring--in\r\none direction as in another.\r\n\r\n_Beating_ is for the purpose of incorporating as much air in the mixture\r\nas possible. It should be done by dipping the spoon in and out, cutting\r\nclear through and lifting from the bottom with each stroke. The process\r\nmust be continuous, and must never be interspersed with any stirring if\r\nit is desired to retain the air within the mixture.\r\n\r\n_Kneading_ is the mode by which materials already in the form of dough\r\nare more thoroughly blended together; it also serves to incorporate air.\r\nThe process is more fully described in the chapter on \"Bread,\"\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE.--Many a cook fails and knows not why, because she does\r\nnot understand the influence of temperature upon materials and food.\r\nFlour and liquids for unfermented breads cannot be too cold, while for\r\nbread prepared with yeast, success is largely dependent upon a warm and\r\nequable temperature throughout the entire process.\r\n\r\nCOOKING UTENSILS.--The earliest cookery was probably accomplished\r\nwithout the aid of any utensils, the food being roasted by burying it in\r\nhot ashes or cooked by the aid of heated stones; but modern cookery\r\nnecessitates the use of a greater or less variety of cooking utensils to\r\nfacilitate the preparation of food, most of which are so familiar to the\r\nreader as to need no description. (A list of those needed for use will\r\nbe found on page 66.) Most of these utensils are manufactured from some\r\nkind of metal, as iron, tin, copper, brass, etc. All metals are\r\ndissolvable in certain substances, and some of those employed for making\r\nhousehold utensils are capable of forming most poisonous compounds when\r\nused for cooking certain foods. This fact should lead to great care on\r\nthe part of the housewife, both in purchasing and in using utensils for\r\ncooking purposes.\r\n\r\nIron utensils, although they are, when new, apt to discolor and impart\r\na disagreeable flavor to food cooked in them, are not objectionable from\r\na health standpoint, if kept clean and free from rust. Iron rust is the\r\nresult of the combination of the iron with oxygen, for which it has so\r\ngreat an affinity that it will decompose water to get oxygen to unite\r\nwith; hence it is that iron utensils rust so quickly when not carefully\r\ndried after using, or if left where they can collect moisture. This is\r\nthe reason why a coating of tallow, which serves to exclude the air and\r\nmoisture, will preserve ironware not in daily use from rusting.\r\n\r\n\"Porcelain ware\" is iron lined with a hard, smooth enamel, and makes\r\nsafe and very desirable cooking utensils. German porcelain ware is\r\nunexcelled for culinary purposes.\r\n\r\n\"Granite ware\" is a material quite recently come into use, the\r\ncomposition of which is a secret, although pronounced by eminent\r\nchemists to be free from all injurious qualities. Utensils made from it\r\nare light in weight, easily kept clean, and for most cooking purposes,\r\nare far superior to those made from any other material.\r\n\r\nWhat is termed \"galvanized iron\" is unsuitable for cooking utensils, it\r\nbeing simply sheet iron coated with zinc, an exceedingly unsafe metal to\r\nbe used for cooking purposes.\r\n\r\nTin, which is simply thin sheet iron coated with tin by dipping several\r\ntimes into vats of the melted metal, is largely employed in the\r\nmanufacture of cooking utensils. Tinware is acted upon by acids, and\r\nwhen used for holding or cooking any acid foods, like sour milk, sour\r\nfruits, tomatoes, etc., harmful substances are liable to be formed,\r\nvarying in quantity and harmfulness with the nature of the acid\r\ncontained in the food.\r\n\r\nIn these days of fraud and adulteration, nearly all the cheaper grades\r\nof tinware contain a greater or less amount of lead in their\r\ncomposition, which owing to its greater abundance and less price, is\r\nused as an adulterant of tin. Lead is also used in the solder with which\r\nthe parts of tinware are united. The action of acids upon lead form very\r\npoisonous compounds, and all lead-adulterated utensils should be wholly\r\ndiscarded for cooking purposes.\r\n\r\n_Test for Lead-Adulterated Tin._--Place upon the metal a small drop of\r\nnitric acid, spreading it to the size of a dime, dry with gentle heat,\r\napply a drop of water, then add a small crystal of iodide of potash. If\r\nlead is present, a yellowish color will be seen very soon after the\r\naddition of the iodide. Lead glazing, which is frequently employed on\r\ncrockery and ironware in the manufacture of cooking utensils, may also\r\nbe detected in the same manner.\r\n\r\nCooking utensils made of copper are not to be recommended from the point\r\nof healthfulness, although many cooks esteem them because copper is a\r\nbetter conductor of heat than iron or tin. The acids of many fruits\r\ncombine with copper to form extremely poisonous substances. Fatty\r\nsubstances, as well as salt and sugar, act upon copper to a greater or\r\nless degree, also vegetables containing sulfur in their composition and\r\nproduce harmful compounds.\r\n\r\nUtensils made of brass, which is a compound of copper and zinc, are not\r\nsafe to use for cooking purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE TOPICS.\r\n\r\n    Bad cooking diminishes happiness and shortens life.--_Wisdom of\r\n    Ages._\r\n\r\n    Says Mrs. Partington: \"Many a fair home has been desiccated by poor\r\n    cooking, and a man's table has been the rock on which his happiness\r\n    has split.\"\r\n\r\n    SIGNIFICANT FACT.--_Lady_--\"Have you had much experience as a cook?\"\r\n    _Applicant_--\"Oh, indeed I have. I was the cook of Mr. and Mrs.\r\n    Peterby for three years.\"\r\n\r\n    _L._--\"Why did you leave them?\"\r\n\r\n    _A._--\"I didn't leave them. They left me. They both died.\"\r\n\r\n    _L._--\"What of?\"\r\n\r\n    _A._--\"Dyspepsia.\"\r\n\r\n    Cooking is generally bad because people falling to routine; habit\r\n    dulls their appreciation, and they do not think about what they are\r\n    eating.--_Didsbury._\r\n\r\n    _Lilly_ (Secretary of the cooking class)--\"Now girls, we've learned\r\n    nine cakes, two kinds of angel food, and seven pies. What next?\"\r\n\r\n    _Susie_ (engaged)--\"Dick's father says I must learn to bake bread.\"\r\n\r\n    _Indignant chorus_--\"Bread? How absurd! What are bakers for?\"\r\n\r\n    It is told of Philip Hecgnet, a French, physician who lived in the\r\n    17th, century, that when calling upon his wealthy patients, he used\r\n    often to go to the kitchen and pantry, embrace the cooks and\r\n    butlers, and exhort them to do their duty well. \"I owe you so much\r\n    gratitude, my dear friends,\" he would say; \"you are so useful to us\r\n    doctors; for if you did not keep on poisoning the people, we should\r\n    all have to go to the poorhouse.\"\r\n\r\n    There are innumerable books of recipes for cooking, but unless the\r\n    cook is master of the principles of his art, and unless he knows the\r\n    why and the wherefore of its processes, he cannot choose a recipe\r\n    intelligently and execute it successfully.--_Richard Estcourt._\r\n\r\n    They who provide the food for the world, decide the health of the\r\n    world. You have only to go on some errands amid the taverns and\r\n    hotels of the United States and Great Britain, to appreciate the\r\n    fact that a vast multitude of the human race are slaughtered by\r\n    incompetent cookery. Though a young woman may have taken lessons in\r\n    music, and may have taken lessons in painting, and lessons in\r\n    astronomy, she is not well educated unless she has taken lessons in\r\n    dough!--_Talmage._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSEHOLD WORKSHOP\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to suppose that any room, however small and unpleasantly\r\nsituated, is \"good enough\" for a kitchen. This is the room where\r\nhousekeepers pass a great portion of their time, and it should be one of\r\nthe brightest and most convenient rooms in the house; for upon the\r\nresults of no other department of woman's domain depend so greatly the\r\nhealth and comfort of the family as upon those involved in this\r\n\"household workshop.\" The character of a person's work is more or less\r\ndependent upon his surroundings, hence is it to be greatly wondered at\r\nthat a woman immured in a small, close, dimly-lighted room, whose only\r\noutlook may be the back alley or the woodshed, supplies her household\r\nwith products far below the standard of health and housewifely skill?\r\n\r\nEvery kitchen should have windows on two sides of the room, and the sun\r\nshould have free entrance through them; the windows should open from the\r\ntop to allow a complete change of air, for light and fresh air are among\r\nthe chief essentials to success in all departments of the household.\r\nGood drainage should also be provided, and the ventilation of the\r\nkitchen ought to be even more carefully attended to than that of a\r\nsleeping room. The ventilation of the kitchen should be so ample as to\r\nthoroughly remove all gases and odors, which, together with steam from\r\nboiling and other cooking processes, generally invade and render to some\r\ndegree unhealthful every other portion of the house. It is the steam\r\nfrom the kitchen which gives a fusty odor to the parlor air and provides\r\na wet-sheet pack for the occupant of the \"spare bed.\" The only way of\r\nwholly eradicating this evil, is the adoption of the suggestion of the\r\nsanitary philosopher who places the kitchen at the top of the house.\r\n\r\nTo lessen to discomforts from heat, a ventilator may be placed above the\r\nrange, that shall carry out of the room all superfluous heat, and aid in\r\nremoving the steam and odors from cooking food. The simplest form of\r\nsuch a ventilator this inverted hopper of sheet iron fitted above the\r\nrange, the upper and smaller end opening into a large flue adjacent to\r\nthe smoke flue for the range. Care must be taken, however, to provide an\r\nample ventilating shaft for this purpose, since a strong draft is\r\nrequired to secure the desired results.\r\n\r\nThere should be ample space for tables, chairs, range, sink, and\r\ncupboards, yet the room should not be so large as to necessitate too\r\nmany steps. A very good size for the ordinary dwelling is 16 x 18 feet.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly much of the distaste for, and neglect of, \"housework,\" so\r\noften deplored in these days, arises from unpleasant surroundings. If\r\nthe kitchen be light, airy, and tidy, and the utensils bright and clean,\r\nthe work of compounding those articles of food which grace the table and\r\nsatisfy the appetite will be a pleasant task, and one entirely worthy of\r\nthe most intelligent and cultivated woman.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable, from a sanitary standpoint, that the kitchen floor be\r\nmade impervious to moisture; hence, concrete or tile floors are better\r\nthan wooden floors. If wooden floors are used, they should be\r\nconstructed of narrow boards of hard wood, carefully joined and\r\nthoroughly saturated with hot linseed oil, well rubbed in to give polish\r\nto the surface.\r\n\r\nCleanliness is the great _desideratum_, and this can be best attained\r\nby having all woodwork in and about the kitchen coated with varnish;\r\nsubstances which cause stain and grease spots, do not penetrate the wood\r\nwhen varnished, and can be easily removed with a damp cloth. Paint is\r\npreferable to whitewash or calcimine for the walls, since it is less\r\naffected by steam, and can be more readily cleaned. A carpet on a\r\nkitchen floor is as out of place as a kitchen sink would be in a parlor.\r\n\r\nThe elements of beauty should not be lacking in the kitchen. Pictures\r\nand fancy articles are inappropriate; but a few pots of easily\r\ncultivated flowers on the window ledge or arranged upon brackets about\r\nthe window in winter, and a window box arranged as a jardiniere, with\r\nvines and blooming plants in summer, will greatly brighten the room, and\r\nthus serve to lighten the task of those whose daily labor confines them\r\nto the precincts of the kitchen.\r\n\r\nTHE KITCHEN FURNITURE.--The furniture for a kitchen should not be\r\ncumbersome, and should be so made and dressed as to be easily cleaned.\r\nThere should be plenty of cupboards, and each for the sake of order,\r\nshould be devoted to a special purpose. Cupboards with sliding doors are\r\nmuch superior to closets. They should be placed upon casters so as to be\r\neasily moved, as they, are thus not only more convenient, but admit of\r\nmore thorough cleanliness.\r\n\r\nCupboards used for the storage of food should be well ventilated;\r\notherwise, they furnish choice conditions for the development of mold\r\nand germs. Movable cupboards may be ventilated by means of openings in\r\nthe top, and doors covered with very fine wire gauze which will admit\r\nthe air but keep out flies and dust. All stationary cupboards and\r\nclosets should have a ventilating flue connected with the main shaft by\r\nwhich the house is ventilated, or directly communicating with the outer\r\nair.\r\n\r\nNo kitchen can be regarded as well furnished without a good timepiece as\r\nan aid to punctuality and economy of time. An eight-day clock with large\r\ndial and plain case is the most suitable.\r\n\r\nEvery kitchen should also be provided with a slate, with sponge and\r\npencil attached, on one side of which the market orders and other\r\nmemoranda may be jotted down, and on the other the bills of fare for the\r\nday or week. In households where servants are kept, the slate will save\r\nmany a vexatious blunder and unnecessary call to the kitchen, while if\r\none is herself mistress, cook, and housekeeper, it may prove an\r\ninvaluable aid and time-saver if thus used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Convenient Kitchen Table.]\r\n\r\nLack of sufficient table room is often a great source of inconvenience\r\nto the housekeeper. To avoid this, arrange swinging tables or shelves at\r\nconvenient points upon the wall, which may be put up or let down as\r\noccasion demands. For ordinary kitchen uses, small tables of suitable\r\nheight on easy-rolling casters, and with zinc tops, are the most\r\nconvenient and most easily kept clean. It is quite as well that they be\r\nmade without drawers, which are too apt to become receptacles for a\r\nheterogeneous mass of rubbish. If desirable to have some handy place for\r\nkeeping articles which are frequently required for use, an arrangement\r\nsimilar to that represented in the accompanying cut may be made at very\r\nsmall expense. It may be also an advantage to arrange small shelves\r\nabout and above the range, on which may be kept various articles\r\nnecessary for cooking purposes.\r\n\r\nOne of the most indispensable articles of furnishing for a\r\nwell-appointed kitchen, is a sink; however, a sink must be properly\r\nconstructed and well cared for, or it is likely to become a source of\r\ngreat danger to the health of the inmates of the household. Earthen-ware\r\nis the best material for kitchen sinks. Iron is very serviceable, but\r\ncorrodes, and if painted or enameled, this soon wears off. Wood is\r\nobjectionable from a sanitary standpoint. A sink made of wood lined with\r\ncopper answers well for a long time if properly cared for.\r\n\r\nThe sink should if possible stand out from the wall, so as to allow free\r\naccess to all sides of it for the sake of cleanliness, and under no\r\ncircumstances should there be any inclosure of woodwork or cupboards\r\nunderneath to serve as a storage place for pots and kettles and all\r\nkinds of rubbish, dust, and germs. It should be supported on legs, and\r\nthe space below should be open for inspection at all times. The pipes\r\nand fixtures should be selected and placed by a competent plumber.\r\n\r\nGreat pains should be taken to keep the pipes clean and well\r\ndisinfected. Refuse of all kinds should be kept out. Thoughtless\r\nhousekeepers and careless domestics often allow greasy water and bits of\r\ntable waste to find their way into the pipes. Drain pipes usually have a\r\nbend, or trap, through which water containing no sediment flows freely;\r\nbut the melted grease which often passes into the pipes mixed with hot\r\nwater, becomes cooled and solid as it descends, adhering to the pipes,\r\nand gradually accumulating until the drain is blocked, or the water\r\npasses through very slowly. A grease-lined pipe is a hotbed for disease\r\ngerms.\r\n\r\nWater containing much grease should be cooled and the grease removed\r\nbefore being turned into the kitchen sink, while bits of refuse should\r\nbe disposed of elsewhere, since prevention of mischief is in this case,\r\nas in most others, far easier than cure. It is customary for\r\nhousekeepers to pour a hot solution of soda or potash down the sink\r\npipes occasionally, to dissolve any grease which may tend to obstruct\r\nthe passage; but this is only a partial safeguard, as there is no\r\ncertainty that all the grease will be dissolved, and any particles\r\nadhering to the pipes very soon undergo putrefaction.\r\n\r\nA frequent flushing with hot water is important; besides which the pipes\r\nshould be disinfected two or three times a week by pouring down a gallon\r\nof water holding in solution a pound of good chloride of lime.\r\n\r\nSTOVES AND RANGES.--The furnishing of a modern kitchen would be\r\nquite incomplete without some form of stove or range. The multiplicity\r\nof these articles, manufactured each with some especial merit of its\r\nown, renders it a somewhat difficult task to make a choice among them.\r\nMuch must, however, depend upon the kind of fuel to be used, the size of\r\nthe household, and various other circumstances which make it necessary\r\nfor each individual housekeeper to decide for herself what is best\r\nadapted to her wants. It may be said, in brief, that economy of fuel,\r\nsimplicity of construction, and efficiency in use are the chief points\r\nto be considered in the selection of stoves and ranges.\r\n\r\nA stove or range of plain finish is to be preferred, because it is much\r\neasier to keep clean, and will be likely to present a better appearance\r\nafter a few months' wear than one of more elaborate pattern. But\r\nwhatever stove or range is selected, its mechanism should be thoroughly\r\nunderstood in every particular, and it should be tested with dampers\r\nopen, with dampers closed, and in every possible way, until one is\r\nperfectly sure she understands its action under all conditions.\r\n\r\nOIL AND GAS STOVES.--In many households, oil, gas, and gasoline\r\nstoves have largely taken the place of the kitchen range, especially\r\nduring the hot weather of summer. They can be used for nearly every\r\npurpose for which a wood or a coal range is used; they require much less\r\nlabor and litter, and can be instantly started into full force and as\r\nquickly turned out when no longer required, while the fact that the heat\r\ncan be regulated with exactness, makes them superior for certain\r\nprocesses of cooking to any other stove. But while these stoves are\r\nconvenient and economical, especially in small families, they should be\r\nused with much care. Aside from the danger from explosion, which is by\r\nno means inconsiderable in the use of gasoline and oil stoves, they are\r\nnot, unless well cared for altogether healthful. Unless the precaution\r\nis taken to use them in well-ventilated rooms or to connect them with a\r\nchimney, they vitiate the atmosphere to a considerable extent with the\r\nproducts of combustion. Oil stoves, unless the wicks are kept well\r\ntrimmed, are apt to smoke, and this smoke is not only disagreeable, but\r\nextremely irritating to the mucous membrane of the nose and throat. Oil\r\nstoves are constructed on the same principle as ordinary oil lamps, and\r\nrequire the same care and attention.\r\n\r\nQuite recently there has been invented by Prof. Edward Atkinson a very\r\nunique apparatus for cooking by means of the heat of an ordinary\r\nkerosene lamp, called the \"Aladdin Cooker.\" The food to be cooked is\r\nplaced in a chamber around which hot water, heated by the flame of the\r\nlamp, circulates. The uniform heat thus obtained performs the process of\r\ncooking, slowly, but most satisfactorily and economically, the result\r\nbeing far superior to that obtained by the ordinary method of cooking by\r\nquick heat. The cooker is only used for stewing and steaming; but Mr.\r\nAtkinson has also invented an oven in which the heat is conveyed to the\r\nplace where it is needed by a column of hot air instead of hot water.\r\nWith this oven, which consists of an outer oven made of non-conducting\r\nmaterial, and an inner oven made of sheet iron, with an intervening\r\nspace between, through which the hot air circulates, no smoke or odor\r\nfrom the lamp can reach the interior.\r\n\r\nKITCHEN. UTENSILS.--The list of necessary kitchen utensils must of\r\ncourse be governed somewhat by individual circumstances, but it should\r\nnot be curtailed for the sake of display in some other department, where\r\nless depends upon the results. A good kitchen outfit is one of the\r\nfoundation-stones of good housekeeping. The following are some of the\r\nmost essential:--\r\n\r\nTwo dish pans; two or more _papier-maché_ tubs for washing glassware;\r\none kneading board; one bread board; one pair scales, with weights;\r\nscrubbing and stove brushes; brooms; dustpans; roller for towel;\r\nwashbowl; soap dish; vegetable brushes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Double Boiler.]\r\n\r\nFOR THE TIN CLOSET.-One dipper; one egg-beater; one two-quart pail;\r\none four-quart pail; six brick-loaf bread pans; three shallow tins;\r\nthree granite-ware pie tins; two perforated sheet iron pans for rolls,\r\netc.; one set of measures, pint, quart, and two quart; two colanders;\r\ntwo fine wire strainers; one flour sifter; one apple corer; one set\r\npatty pans; two dripping pans; two sets gem irons; one set muffin rings;\r\none toaster; one broiler; the six saucepans, different sizes; two\r\nsteamers; six milk-pans; one dozen basins, different sizes; one chopping\r\nbowl and knife; six double boilers; two funnels, large and small; one\r\ncan opener; griddle; kettles, iron and granite ware; two water baths.\r\n\r\nFOR THE DISH CLOSET.--One half dozen iron-stone china cups; three\r\nquart bowls; three pint bowls; two large mixing bowls; two quart bowls\r\nwith lip; six deep plates; three kitchen pitchers; one glass rolling\r\npin; six wooden and six iron spoons, assorted sizes; six kitchen\r\nteaspoons; one stone baking pot; glass jars for stores; crocks and jars.\r\n\r\nTHE PANTRY.--The pantry and china closet should have direct light\r\nand good ventilation. The dark, dingy places sometimes used for this\r\npurpose are germ breeders. There should be plenty of shelf room and\r\ncupboards for the fine glass and china-ware, with a well-arranged sink\r\nfor washing the dishes. The sink for this purpose is preferably one\r\nlined with tinned or planished copper; for dishes will be less liable to\r\nbecome injured and broken then when washed in an iron or earthen-ware\r\nsink. Extension or folding shelves are a great convenience, and can be\r\narranged for the sink if desired. The accompanying cuts illustrate a\r\nsink of four compartments for dish-washing, devised by the writer for\r\nuse in the Sanitarium Domestic Economy kitchen, which can be closed and\r\nused as a table. Two zinc trays fit the top, upon which to place the\r\ndish drainers. If preferred, the top might be arranged as a drainer, by\r\nmaking it of well-seasoned hard wood, with a number of inclined grooves\r\nto allow the water to run into the sink. If the house be heated by\r\nsteam, a plate-warmer is an important part of the pantry furnishing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Compartment Sink for Dish-Washing. Open.]\r\n\r\nTHE STOREROOM.--If possible to do so, locate the room for the\r\nkeeping of the kitchen supplies on the cool side of the house. Plenty of\r\nlight, good ventilation, and absolute cleanliness are essential, as the\r\nslightest contamination of air is likely to render the food supply unfit\r\nfor use.\r\n\r\nThe refrigerator should not be connected with the kitchen drain pipe,\r\nand the greatest care should be taken to keep it clean and sweet. It\r\nshould be thoroughly scrubbed with borax or sal-soda and water, and well\r\naired, at least once a week. Strongly flavored foods and milk should not\r\nbe kept in the same refrigerator. The ice to be used should always be\r\ncarefully washed before putting in the refrigerator. Care should also be\r\ntaken to replenish it before the previous supply is entirely melted, as\r\nthe temperature rises when the ice becomes low, and double the quantity\r\nwill be required to cool the refrigerator that would be necessary to\r\nkeep it of uniform temperature if added before the ice was entirely out.\r\n\r\nTHE WATER SUPPLY.--The water used for drinking and cooking purposes\r\nshould receive equal consideration with the food supply, and from\r\nwhatever source obtained, it should be frequently tested for impurities,\r\nsince that which looks the most refreshing may be contaminated with\r\norganic poison of the most treacherous character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Compartment Sink for Dish-Washing. Closed.]\r\n\r\nA good and simple test solution, which any housewife can use, may be\r\nprepared by dissolving twelve grains of caustic potash and three of\r\npermanganate of potash in an ounce of distilled water, or filtered soft\r\nwater. Add a drop of this solution to a glass of the water to be tested.\r\nIf the pink color imparted by the solution disappears at once, add\r\nanother drop of the solution, and continue adding drop by drop until the\r\npink color will remain for half an hour or more. The amount of the\r\nsolution necessary to security permanent color is very fair index to the\r\nquality of the water. If the color imparted by the first one or two\r\ndrops disappears within a half hour, the water should be rejected as\r\nprobably dangerous. Water which is suspected of being impure may be\r\nrendered safe by boiling. Filters are only of service in removing\r\nsuspended particles and the unpleasant taste of rain water; a really\r\ndangerous water is not rendered safe by filtering in the ordinary\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nCELLARS.--Sanitarians tell us that cellars should never be built\r\nunder dwelling houses. Because of improper construction and neglect,\r\nthey are undoubtedly the cause of much disease and many deaths. A\r\nbasement beneath the house is advantageous, but the greatest of care\r\nshould be given to construct it in accord with sanitary laws. It should\r\nbe thoroughly drained that there may be no source of dampness, but\r\nshould not be connected with a sewer or a cesspool. It should have walls\r\nso made as to be impervious to air and water. An ordinary brick or stone\r\nwall is inefficient unless well covered with good Portland cement\r\npolished smooth. The floors should likewise be covered with cement,\r\notherwise the cellar is likely to be filled with impure air derived from\r\nthe soil, commonly spoken of as \"ground air,\" and which offers a\r\nconstant menace to the health of those who live over cellars with\r\nuncemented walls and floors.\r\n\r\nLight and ventilation are quite as essential to the healthfulness of a\r\ncellar as to other rooms of the dwelling. Constantly during warm\r\nweather, and at least once a day during the winter season, windows\r\nshould be opened wide, thus effecting a free interchange of air. All\r\nmold and mustiness should be kept out by thorough ventilation and\r\nfrequent coats of whitewash to the walls. Vegetables and other\r\ndecomposable articles, if stored in the basement, should be frequently\r\nsorted, and all decaying substances promptly removed. This is of the\r\nutmost importance, since the germs and foul gases arising from\r\ndecomposing food stuffs form a deadly source of contamination through\r\nevery crack and crevice.\r\n\r\n\r\nKITCHEN CONVENIENCES.\r\n\r\nIn these days of invention and progress, much thought and ingenuity have\r\nbeen expended in making and perfecting labor-saving articles and\r\nutensils, which serve to make housework less of a burden and more of a\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\nTHE STEAM-COOKER.--One of the most unique of these conveniences is\r\nthe steam-cooker, one kind of which is illustrated by the accompanying\r\ncut. Steaming is, for many foods, a most economical and satisfactory\r\nmethod of cooking. Especially is this true respecting fruits, grains,\r\nand vegetables, the latter of which often have the larger proportion of\r\ntheir best nutritive elements dissolved and thrown away in the water in\r\nwhich they are boiled. In the majority of households it is, however, the\r\nmethod least depended upon, because the ordinary steamer over a pot of\r\nboiling water requires too much attention, takes up too much stove room,\r\nand creates too much steam in the kitchen, to prove a general favorite.\r\nThe steam-cooker has an escape-steam tube through which all excess of\r\nsteam and odors passes into the fire, and thus its different\r\ncompartments may contain and cook an entire dinner, if need be, and over\r\none stove hole or one burner of an oil or gasoline stove.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Steam-Cooker.]\r\n\r\nTHE VEGETABLE PRESS.--The accompanying cut represents this handy\r\nutensil, which is equally useful as a potato and vegetable masher; as a\r\nsauce, gruel, and gravy strainer; as a fruit press, and for many other\r\npurposes for which a colander or strainer is needed, while it economizes\r\nboth time and labor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vegetable Press.]\r\n\r\nLEMON DRILL.--This little article for extracting the juice of the\r\nlemon, and which can be purchased of most hardware dealers, is quite\r\nsuperior to the more commonly used lemon squeezer. Being made of glass,\r\nits use is not open to the danger that the use of metal squeezer is are\r\nfrom poisonous combinations of the acid and metal, while the juice\r\nextracted is free from pulp, seeds, and the oil of the skin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lemon Drill.]\r\n\r\nA HANDY WAITER.--In many households where no help is employed, a\r\nlabor-saving device like the one represented in the accompanying\r\nillustration, will be found of great service. It is a light double table\r\non easy-rolling casters, and can be readily constructed by anyone handy\r\nin the use of tools. If preferred, the top may be covered with zinc. In\r\nsetting or clearing the table, the dishes may be placed on the lower\r\nshelf, with the food on the top, and the table rolled from pantry to\r\ndining room, and from dining room to kitchen; thus accomplishing, with\r\none trip, what is ordinarily done with hundreds of steps by the weary\r\nhousewife. If desirable to reset the table at once after a meal, the\r\nwaiter will be found most serviceable as a place whereon the glassware\r\nand silverware may be washed. It is equally serviceable for holding the\r\nutensils and material needed when cooking; being so easily moved, they\r\ncan be rolled to the stove and is always convenient.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Handy Waiter.]\r\n\r\nWALL CABINET.--where cupboard space is limited, or where for\r\nconvenience it is desirable to have some provision for supplies and\r\nutensils near the range and baking table, a wall cabinet offers a most\r\nconvenient arrangement. It may be made of a size to fit in any\r\nconvenient niche, and constructed plainly or made as ornamental as one\r\npleases, with doors to exclude the dust, shelves on which to keep tin\r\ncans filled with rice, oatmeal, cracked wheat, and other grains; glass\r\njars of raisins, sugar, citron, cornstarch, etc.; hooks on which may\r\nhang the measures, egg-beater, potato masher, and such frequently needed\r\nutensils; and with drawers for paring knives, spoons, and similar\r\narticles, the wall cabinet becomes a _multum in parvo_ of convenience\r\nwhich would greatly facilitate work in many households.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wall Cabinet.]\r\n\r\nPERCOLATE HOLDER.--The accompanying cut illustrates an\r\neasily-constructed device for holding a jelly bag or percolate. It may\r\nbe so made as to be easily screwed to any ordinary table, and will save\r\nthe housekeeper far more than its cost in time and patience.\r\n\r\nKNEADING TABLE.--Much of the tiresome labor of bread-making can be\r\navoided if one is supplied with some convenient table similar to the one\r\nrepresented in the cut, wherein the needed material and utensils may be\r\nkept in readiness at all times. The table illustrated has two large tin\r\ndrawers, each divided into two compartments, in which may be kept corn\r\nmeal, entire wheat, and Graham and white flours. Two drawers above\r\nprovide a place for rolling-pin, bread mallet, gem irons, spoons, etc.,\r\nwhile a narrow compartment just beneath the hardwood top affords a place\r\nfor the kneading board. The table being on casters is easily moved to\r\nany part of the kitchen for use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Percolater Holder.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Kneading Table.]\r\n\r\nDISH-TOWEL RACK.--Nothing adds more to the ease and facility with\r\nwhich the frequent dish-washings of the household may be accomplished\r\nthan clean, well-dried towels. For quick drying,--an item of great\r\nimportance if one would keep the towels fresh and sweet,--the towel rack\r\nrepresented in the cut, and which can be made by any carpenter, is a\r\nmost handy device. When not in use, it can be turned up against the wall\r\nas illustrated. It is light, affords sufficient drying space so that no\r\ntowel need be hung on top of another, and projecting out from the wall\r\nas it does, the free circulation of air between the towels soon dries\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dish-Towel Rack.]\r\n\r\nKITCHEN BRUSHES.--These useful little articles can be put to such a\r\nvariety of uses that they are among the chiefest of household\r\nconveniences. They are also so inexpensive, costing but five cents\r\napiece without handles and seven cents with handles, that no housewife\r\ncan afford to be without a supply of them. For the washing of dishes\r\nwith handles, the outside of iron kettles, and other cooking utensils\r\nmade of iron, they are especially serviceable. The smaller sizes are\r\nlikewise excellent for cleaning cut glass ware, Majolica ware,--in fact,\r\nany kind of ware with raised figures or corrugated surfaces. For\r\ncleaning a grater, nothing is superior to one of these little brushes.\r\nSuch a brush is also most serviceable for washing celery, as the\r\ncorrugated surface of the stalk makes a thorough cleaning with the hands\r\na difficult operation. Then if one uses a brush with handle, ice water,\r\nwhich adds to the crispness of the celery, may be used for the cleaning,\r\nas there will be no necessity for putting the hands in the water. A\r\nsmall whisk broom is also valuable for the same purpose. Such vegetables\r\nas potatoes, turnips, etc., are best cleaned with a brush. It makes the\r\nwork less disagreeable, as the hands need not be soiled by the process,\r\nand in no other way can the cleaning be so well and thoroughly done.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vegetable Brush.]\r\n\r\nAll brushes after being used should be carefully scalded and placed\r\nbrush downward in a wire sponge basket, or hung up on hooks. If left\r\naround carelessly, they soon acquire the musty smell of a neglected\r\ndishcloth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE TOPICS.\r\n\r\n    The kitchen is a chemical laboratory, in which are conducted a\r\n    number of chemical processes by which our food is converted from its\r\n    crudest state to condition more suitable for digestion and\r\n    nutrition, and made more agreeable to the palate.--_Prof. Matthew\r\n    Williams._\r\n\r\n    Half the trouble between mistresses and maids arises from the\r\n    disagreeable surroundings to which servants are confined. There is\r\n    no place more dismal than the ordinary kitchen in city dwellings. It\r\n    is half underground, ill-lighted, and unwholesome. What wonder,\r\n    then, in the absence of sunlight, there is a lack of sunny temper\r\n    and cheerful service? An ill-lighted kitchen is almost sure to be a\r\n    dirty one, where germs will thrive and multiply. Let sanitary\r\n    kitchens be provided, and we shall have more patient mistresses and\r\n    more willing servants.--_Sel._\r\n\r\n    A sluggish housemaid exclaimed, when scolded for the uncleanliness\r\n    of her kitchen, \"I'm sure the room would be clean enough if it were\r\n    not for the nasty sun, which is always showing the dirty\r\n    corners.\"--_Sel._\r\n\r\n    If we would look for ready hands and willing hearts in our kitchens,\r\n    we should make them pleasant and inviting for those who literally\r\n    bear the \"burden and heat of the day\" in this department of our\r\n    homes, where, emphatically, \"woman's work is never done.\" We should\r\n    no longer be satisfied to locate our kitchens in the most\r\n    undesirable corner of the house. We should demand ample\r\n    light,--sunshine if possible,--and justly too; for the very light\r\n    itself is inspiring to the worker. It will stir up cheer and breed\r\n    content in the minds of those whose lot is cast in this work-a-day\r\n    room.--_Sel._\r\n\r\n    Any invention on the part of the housekeeper intended to be a\r\n    substitute for watchfulness, will prove a delusion and a\r\n    snare.--_Sel._\r\n\r\n    \"The first wealth is health,\" says Emerson.\r\n\r\n    A knowledge of sanitary principles should be regarded as an\r\n    essential part of every woman's education, and obedience to sanitary\r\n    laws should be ranked, as it was in the Mosaic code, as a religious\r\n    duty.--_Sel._\r\n\r\n    Much of the air of the house comes from the cellar. A heated house\r\n    acts like a chimney. A German experimenter states that one half of\r\n    the cellar air makes its way into the first story, one third into\r\n    the second, and one fifth into the third.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCEREALS AND THEIR PREPARATION FOR THE TABLE\r\n\r\nCereal is the name given to those seeds used as food (wheat, rye, oats,\r\nbarley, corn, rice, etc.), which are produced by plants belonging to the\r\nvast order known as the grass family. They are used for food both in the\r\nunground state and in various forms of mill products.\r\n\r\nThe grains are pre-eminently nutritious, and when well prepared, easily\r\ndigested foods. In composition they are all similar, but variations in\r\ntheir constituent elements and the relative amounts of these various\r\nelements, give them different degrees of alimentary value. They each\r\ncontain one or more of the nitrogenous elements,--gluten, albumen,\r\ncaseine, and fibrin,--together with starch, dextrine, sugar, and fatty\r\nmatter, and also mineral elements and woody matter, or cellulose. The\r\ncombined nutritive value of the grain foods is nearly three times that\r\nof beef, mutton, or poultry. As regards the proportion of the food\r\nelements necessary to meet the various requirements of the system,\r\ngrains approach more nearly the proper standard than most other foods;\r\nindeed, wheat contains exactly the correct proportion of the food\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nBeing thus in themselves so nearly perfect foods, and when properly\r\nprepared, exceedingly palatable and easy of digestion, it is a matter of\r\nsurprise that they are not more generally used; yet scarcely one family\r\nin fifty makes any use of the grains, save in the form of flour, or an\r\noccasional dish of rice or oatmeal. This use of grains is far too meager\r\nto adequately represent their value as an article of diet. Variety in\r\nthe use of grains is as necessary as in the use of other food material,\r\nand the numerous grain preparations now to be found in market render it\r\nquite possible to make this class of foods a staple article of diet, if\r\nso desired, without their becoming at all monotonous.\r\n\r\nIn olden times the grains were largely depended upon as a staple food,\r\nand it is a fact well authenticated by history that the highest\r\ncondition of man has always been associated with wheat-consuming\r\nnations. The ancient Spartans, whose powers of endurance are proverbial,\r\nwere fed on a grain diet, and the Roman soldiers who under Caesar\r\nconquered the world, carried each a bag of parched grain in his pocket\r\nas his daily ration.\r\n\r\nOther nationalities at the present time make extensive use of the\r\nvarious grains. Rice used in connection with some of the leguminous\r\nseeds, forms the staple article of diet for a large proportion of the\r\nhuman race. Rice, unlike the other grain foods, is deficient in the\r\nnitrogenous elements, and for this reason its use needs to be\r\nsupplemented by other articles containing an excess of the nitrogenous\r\nmaterial. It is for this reason, doubtless, that the Hindoos use\r\nlentils, and the Chinese eat peas and beans in connection with rice.\r\n\r\nWe frequently meet people who say they cannot use the grains,--that they\r\ndo not agree with them. With all deference to the opinion of such\r\npeople, it may be stated that the difficulty often lies in the fact that\r\nthe grain was either not properly cooked, not properly eaten, or not\r\nproperly accompanied. A grain, simply because it is a grain, is by no\r\nmeans warranted to faithfully fulfil its mission unless properly\r\ntreated. Like many another good thing excellent in itself, if found in\r\nbad company, it is prone to create mischief, and in many cases the root\r\nof the whole difficulty may be found in the excessive amount of sugar\r\nused with the grain.\r\n\r\nSugar is not needed with grains to increase their alimentary value. The\r\nstarch which constitutes a large proportion of their food elements must\r\nitself be converted into sugar by the digestive processes before\r\nassimilation, hence the addition of cane sugar only increases the burden\r\nof the digestive organs, for the pleasure of the palate. The Asiatics,\r\nwho subsist largely upon rice, use no sugar upon it, and why should it\r\nbe considered requisite for the enjoyment of wheat, rye, oatmeal,\r\nbarley, and other grains, any more than it is for our enjoyment of bread\r\nor other articles made from these same grains? Undoubtedly the use of\r\ngrains would become more universal if they were served with less or no\r\nsugar. The continued use of sugar upon grains has a tendency to cloy the\r\nappetite, just as the constant use of cake or sweetened bread in the\r\nplace of ordinary bread would do. Plenty of nice, sweet cream or fruit\r\njuice, is a sufficient dressing, and there are few persons who after a\r\nshort trial would not come to enjoy the grains without sugar, and would\r\nthen as soon think of dispensing with a meal altogether as to dispense\r\nwith the grains.\r\n\r\nEven when served without sugar, the grains may not prove altogether\r\nhealthful unless they are properly eaten. Because they are made soft by\r\nthe process of cooking and on this account do not require masticating to\r\nbreak them up, the first process of digestion or insalivation is usually\r\noverlooked. But it must be remembered that grains are largely composed\r\nof starch, and that starch must be mixed with the saliva, or it will\r\nremain undigested in the stomach, since the gastric juice only digests\r\nthe nitrogenous elements. For this reason it is desirable to eat the\r\ngrains in connection with some hard food. Whole-wheat wafers, nicely\r\ntoasted to make them crisp and tender, toasted rolls, and unfermented\r\nzwieback, are excellent for this purpose. Break two or three wafers into\r\nrather small pieces over each individual dish before pouring on the\r\ncream. In this way, a morsel of the hard food may be taken with each\r\nspoonful of the grains. The combination of foods thus secured, is most\r\npleasing. This is a specially advantageous method of serving grains for\r\nchildren, who are so liable to swallow their food without proper\r\nmastication.\r\n\r\nCOOKING OF GRAINS.--All grains, with the exception of rice, and the\r\nvarious grain meals, require prolonged cooking with gentle and\r\ncontinuous heat, in order to so disintegrate their tissues and change\r\ntheir starch into dextrine as to render them easy of digestion. Even the\r\nso-called \"steam-cooked\" grains, advertised to be ready for use in five\r\nor ten minutes, require a much longer cooking to properly fit them for\r\ndigestion. These so-called quickly prepared grains are simply steamed\r\nbefore grinding, which has the effect to destroy any low organisms\r\ncontained in the grain. They are then crushed and shredded. Bicarbonate\r\nof soda and lime is added to help dissolve the albuminoids, and\r\nsometimes diastase to aid the conversion of the starch into sugar; but\r\nthere is nothing in this preparatory process that so alters the chemical\r\nnature of the grain as to make it possible to cook it ready for easy\r\ndigestion in five or ten minutes. An insufficiently cooked grain,\r\nalthough it may be palatable, is not in a condition to be readily acted\r\nupon by the digestive fluids, and is in consequence left undigested to\r\nact as a mechanical irritant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Double Boiler.]\r\n\r\nFor the proper cooking of grains the double boiler is the best and most\r\nconvenient utensil for ordinary purposes. If one does not possess a\r\ndouble boiler, a very fair substitute may be improvised by using a\r\ncovered earthen crock placed within a kettle of boiling water, or by\r\nusing two pails, a smaller within a larger one containing boiling water.\r\n\r\nA closed steamer or steam-cooker is also valuable for the cooking of\r\ngrains. Grains may be cooked in an ordinary kettle, but the difficulties\r\nto be encountered, in order to prolong the cooking sufficiently and\r\nprevent burning, make it the least desirable utensil for this purpose.\r\n\r\nWater is the liquid usually employed for cooking grains, but many of\r\nthem are richer and finer flavored when milk is mixed with the\r\nwater,--one part to two of water. Especially is this true of rice,\r\nhominy, and farina. When water is used, soft water is preferable to\r\nhard. No salt is necessary, but if used at all, it is generally added to\r\nthe water before stirring in the grain or meal.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of liquid required varies with the different grains, the\r\nmanner in which they are milled, the method by which they are cooked,\r\nand the consistency desired for the cooked grain, more liquid being\r\nrequired for a porridge than for a mush. The following table gives the\r\ntime necessary for cooking and the quantity of liquid required for the\r\nvarious grains, with the exception of rice, when cooked in a double\r\nboiler or closed steamer, to produce a mush of ordinary consistency. If\r\nan ordinary kettle is used for cooking the grains, a larger quantity of\r\nwater will be needed:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING PROPORTION OF GRAIN AND LIQUID REQUIRED, WITH APPROXIMATE\r\nTIME, WHEN A DOUBLE BOILER IS USED.\r\n\r\n                         Quantity of       Water        Hours to\r\n                           Grain.

Measure both liquid and grain accurately with the same utensil, or\r\nwith two of equal size.\r\n\r\n2. Have the water boiling when the grain is introduced, but do not\r\nallow it to boil for a long time previous, until it is considerably\r\nevaporated, as that will change the proportion of water and grain\r\nsufficiently to alter the consistency of the mush when cooked. Introduce\r\nthe grain slowly, so as not to stop the sinking to the bottom, and the\r\nwhole becomes thickened. If the grain is cooked in a double boiler, this\r\nfirst boiling should be done with the inner dish directly over the fire,\r\nand when the grain has thickened or become \"set,\" as it is termed, the\r\ndish should at once be placed in the outer boiler, the water in which\r\nshould be boiling. It will then require no further care during the\r\nentire cooking, safe to keep the outer boiler filled and the water\r\nboiling. If the grain is to be cooked in a steam-cooker, as soon as set\r\nit may be turned into a china or an earthen dish, suitable for use on\r\nthe table, and placed at once in the steamer to complete the cooking. If\r\nan ordinary kettle is used, it is well to place it upon an iron ring or\r\nbrick on some part of the range were it will just simmer, for the\r\nremainder of the cooking.\r\n\r\n3. Stir the grain continuously until it has set, but not at all\r\nafterward. Grains are much more appetizing if, while properly softened,\r\nthey can still be made to retain their original form. Stirring renders\r\nthe preparation pasty, and destroys its appearance. Grains cooked in a\r\ndouble boiler will require no stirring, and there will be little danger\r\nof their being lumpy, underdone on top, and scorched at the bottom, as\r\nis so often the case when cooked in a single boiler.\r\n\r\n4. Cook continuously. If it be necessary to replenish the water in the\r\nouter boiler at anytime, let it be done with water of boiling\r\ntemperature. If it is desired to have the mush quite thick and dry, the\r\nboiler should be left uncovered during the latter part of the cooking.\r\nIf preferred moist, keep the cover on.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of all mushes with meal or flour, it is a good plan\r\nto make the material into a batter with a portion of the liquid retained\r\nfrom the quantity given, before introducing it into the boiling water.\r\nThis prevents the tendency to cook in lumps, so frequent when dry meal\r\nis scattered into boiling liquid. Care must be taken, however, to add\r\nthe moistened portion very slowly, stirring vigorously meantime, so that\r\nthe boiling will not be checked. Use warm water for moistening. The\r\nother directions given for the whole or broken grains are applicable to\r\nthe ground products.\r\n\r\nGRAINS FOR BREAKFAST.--Since hasty preparation will not suffice for\r\nthe grains, they cannot be conveniently cooked in the morning in time\r\nfor breakfast. This difficulty may be obviated by cooking the day\r\nprevious, and reheating in the following way:--\r\n\r\nPlace the grain, when sufficiently cooked, in the refrigerator or in\r\nsome place where it will cool quickly (as slow cooling might cause\r\nfermentation), to remain overnight. If cooked in a porcelain-lined or\r\ngranite-ware double boiler, it may be left undisturbed, if uncovered. If\r\ncooked in tin or iron, turn the grain into a large earthen or china\r\ndish. To heat in the morning, fill the outer boiler with boiling water,\r\nplace the inner dish containing the grain therein, and steam until\r\nthoroughly heated. No stirring and no additional liquid will be\r\nnecessary, and if placed upon the stove when beginning the preparations\r\nfor breakfast, it will be ready for serving in good season. If the grain\r\nhas been kept in an earthen dish, it may best be reheated by placing\r\nthat inside the steam cooker or an ordinary steamer over a kettle of\r\nboiling water.\r\n\r\nCracked wheat, pearl wheat, oatmeal, and other course grain preparations\r\nto be reheated, require for cooking a half cup of water in addition to\r\nthe quantity given in the table. For rolled wheat, rolled oats, rolled\r\nrye, and other crushed grains, no more is needed. Grains may be used for\r\nbreakfast without reheating, if served with hot milk or cream. If one\r\nhas an Aladdin oven, the problem of grains for breakfast may be easily\r\nsolved by cooking them all night, and if started late in the evening,\r\nthey may be thus cooked over a single burner oil stove with the flame\r\nturned low.\r\n\r\nGRAINS AN ECONOMICAL FOOD.--While grains are pre-eminently among\r\nthe most nutritious of foods, they are also among the most economical,\r\nthe average price being from five to seven cents a pound, and even less\r\nwhen purchased in bulk. If it be objected that they require much fuel to\r\nsecure the prolonged cooking necessary, we would say that a few cents'\r\nworth of oil a week and a small lamp stove will accomplish the cooking\r\nin a most efficient manner. For a hot-weather food there are few\r\narticles which give greater satisfaction and require less time and labor\r\non the part of the housewife than grains, cooked by the aid of a small\r\nlamp stove.\r\n\r\nWHEAT.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--Wheat is the most important of the grain foods. It is\r\nprobably a native of Southwestern Asia, though like most grains\r\ncultivated from the earliest periods, its history is extremely obscure.\r\n\r\nWheat is of two principal kinds, characterized as soft and hard wheat,\r\nthough there are hundreds of named varieties of the grain. The\r\ndistinction between many of these is due to variation in the relative\r\nproportions of starch and nitrogenous matter. Some contain not more than\r\neight per cent of nitrogenous elements, while others contain eighteen or\r\ntwenty per cent, with a corresponding decrease in carbonaceous elements.\r\nThis difference depends upon the soil, cultivation, season, climate, and\r\nother conditions under which the grain is produced.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the wheat grain consists of an external tegument of a\r\nhard, woody nature, so coherent that it appears in the form of scales or\r\nbran when the wheat is ground, and an inner portion, more soft and\r\nfriable, consisting of several cellular layers. The layer nearest the\r\nouter husk contains vegetable fibrin and fatty matter. The second layer\r\nis largely composed of gluten cells; while the center comprising the\r\nbulk of the grain, is chiefly made up of starch granules with a small\r\nproportion of gluten.\r\n\r\nThe structure of a wheat kernel is well illustrated in the \r\naccompanying cut. As will be seen, the different food elements are \r\nsituated in different parts of the grain, and not uniformly distributed\r\nthroughout its structure. The outer husk of the berry is composed wholly\r\nof innutritious and indigestible matter, but the thin layers which lie\r\nnext this outer covering contain the larger proportion of the\r\nnitrogenous elements to be found in the entire kernel. The central\r\nportion consists almost wholly of farinaceous matter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sectional View of Wheat Kernel.]\r\n\r\nPhosphates and other mineral matter are present to some extent\r\nthroughout the entire grain, but preponderates in the external part.\r\nHere is also found a peculiar, soluble, active principle called\r\ndiastase, which possesses the power of converting starch into sugar. The\r\ndark color and marked flavor of Graham bread is undoubtedly due to the\r\ninfluence of this element.\r\n\r\nUntil within a few years the unground grain was rarely used as an\r\narticle of food, but people are beginning to appreciate its\r\nwholesomeness, and cracked, rolled, and pearled wheats are coming\r\nrapidly into favor. Cracked wheat is the grain cleaned and then cut into\r\ntwo or more pieces; in rolled wheat the grains are mashed between\r\nrollers, by which process they are thoroughly softened in every part,\r\nand are then easily cooked. Pearl wheat is the whole grain cleaned and\r\ndressed. The whole grain is also cooked sometimes in its natural state.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION AND COOKING.--Few articles of food show greater\r\ndifference between good and poor cooking than the various grains. Dry,\r\nharsh, or underdone, they are as unwholesome as unpalatable. Like most\r\nof the grains, wheat, with the exception of new wheat boiled whole,\r\nshould be put into boiling water and allowed to cook continuously but\r\nslowly until done. Any of the unground preparations require prolonged\r\ncooking. The average length of time and the approximate amount of water\r\nneeded in cooking _one cupful_ of the various wheat preparations in a\r\ndouble boiler is stated on page 82.\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nPEARL WHEAT.--Heat a quart of water to boiling in the inner dish of\r\na double boiler, and stir into it one cup or one-half pint of pearl\r\nwheat. Let it boil rapidly until thickened and the wheat has ceased\r\nsettling, then place in the outer boiler, in which the water should be\r\nboiling, and cook continuously from three to four hours.\r\n\r\nCRACKED WHEAT.--Cracked wheat may be cooked in the same manner as\r\npearl wheat, by using four and one-half parts of water to one of grain.\r\nThe length of time required to cook it thoroughly is about the same as\r\nfor pearl wheat.\r\n\r\nROLLED WHEAT.--This preparation of wheat requires only three parts\r\nwater to one of wheat. It should be cooked in the same way as pearled\r\nwheat, but requires only three hours' cooking.\r\n\r\nBOILED WHEAT (sometimes called frumenty).--Select newly-cut wheat,\r\nwell rubbed or threshed out. Look it over carefully, wash, and put to\r\ncook in five times its measure of cold water. Let it come to a boil, and\r\ncook gently until the grains burst open, and it can be readily mashed\r\nbetween the thumb and finger. This will require from four to ten hours,\r\ndepending upon the age and variety of the wheat used. When done, it\r\nshould be even full of a rich, thick liquor. If necessary, add more\r\nboiling water, but stir as little as possible. It may be served with\r\ncream, the same as other wheat preparations. It is also excellent served\r\nwith lemon and other fruit sauces.\r\n\r\nWHEAT WITH RAISINS.--Raisins or Zante currants may be added to any\r\nof the foregoing recipes, if desired. The raisins or currants should be\r\nwell steamed previously, however, and stirred in lightly and evenly just\r\nbefore dishing. If cooked with the grain, they become soft, broken, and\r\ninsipid. Figs, well steamed and chopped, may be added in the same way.\r\n\r\nWHEAT WITH FRESH FRUIT.--Fresh whortleberries, blueberries, and\r\nblackberries stirred into any of the well-cooked wheat preparations just\r\nbefore serving, make a very desirable addition. A most delicious dish\r\nmay be prepared by stirring into well-cooked cracked wheat a few\r\nspoonfuls of rather thick cream and some fresh wild blackberries. Serve\r\nhot.\r\n\r\nMOLDED WHEAT.--Cracked wheat, rolled wheat, or pearl wheat, cooked\r\naccording to the foregoing recipes, and turned into molds until cold,\r\nmakes a very palatable dessert, and may be served with sugar and cream\r\nor with fruit juice. Bits of jelly placed on top of the molds in the\r\nform of stars or crosses, add to the appearance. Molded grains are also\r\nvery nice served with fresh berries, either mashed or whole, arranged\r\naround the mold.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINER MILL PRODUCTS OF WHEAT.\r\n\r\nThe grain of wheat is inclosed in a woody envelope. The cellular layers\r\njust beneath contain the largest proportion of nitrogenous matter, in\r\nthe form of gluten, and are hard of pulverization, while the starchy\r\nheart of the grain is easily crumbled into fine dust. Thus it will be\r\nreadily understood that when the grain is subjected to an equal\r\npulverizing force, the several portions will be likely to be crushed\r\ninto particles of different sizes. The outer husk being toughest, will\r\nbe the least affected, the nitrogenous or glutenous portion will be much\r\nfiner, while the brittle starch will be reduced to powder. This first\r\nsimple product of grinding is termed wheat meal, unbolted, or Graham\r\nflour, and of course contains all the elements of the grain. In ordinary\r\nmilling, however, this is subjected to various siftings, boltings, or\r\ndressings, to separate the finer from the coarser particles, and then\r\nsubdivided into various grades of flour, which vary much in composition\r\nand properties. The coarser product contains the largest proportion of\r\nnutrients, while in the finer portions there is an exclusion of a large\r\npart of the nitrogenous element of the grain. The outer portions of the\r\nwheat kernel, which contain the greater part of the nitrogenous element,\r\nare darker in color than the central, starchy portion. It will be\r\napparent, then, that the finer and whiter the flour, the less nutriment\r\nit is likely to contain, and that in the use of superfine white flour\r\nthe eye is gratified at the expense of the body.\r\n\r\nA preparation called farina, is made from the central portion of wheat,\r\nfreed from bran, and crushed into granules. Another preparation, called\r\nGraham grits, is prepared by granulating the outer layers of the kernel\r\ntogether with the germ of the wheat. This preparation, comparatively a\r\nnew one, includes the most nutritious properties of the grain, and its\r\ngranular form renders it excellent for mushes as well as for other\r\npurposes. Farina is scarcely more nutritious than white flour, and\r\nshould not be used as a staple food. Graham grits contains the best\r\nelements of the wheat grain in good proportion, and is one of the best\r\npreparations of wheat. Other preparations of wheat somewhat similar in\r\ncharacter are farinose, germlet, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nFARINA.--Heat a pint of milk and one of water, or if preferred, a\r\nquart of milk, in the inner cup of a double boiler; and when boiling,\r\nstir in five tablespoonfuls of farina, moistened evenly with a little\r\nmilk. Let it boil rapidly until well set, which will be in about five or\r\neight minutes; then place in the outer boiler, and cook one hour. Serve\r\ncold or hot with a dressing of cream or fruit juices. Farina may be\r\ncooked in water alone, but on account of its lack of nutritive elements,\r\nit is more valuable if prepared with milk.\r\n\r\nFARINA WITH FIG SAUCE.--Cook the farina as in the foregoing recipe,\r\nand serve hot with a fig sauce prepared as follows:--\r\n\r\nCarefully look over, washed, and chop or cut quite finally, enough good\r\nfigs to make a cupful. Stew in a pint of water, to which has been added\r\na tablespoonful of sugar, until they are one homogeneous mass. If the\r\nfigs are not of the best quality and do not readily soften, it is well,\r\nafter stewing for a time, to rub them through a colander or vegetable\r\npress to break up the tough portions and make a smooth sauce. Put a\r\nspoonful of the hot fig sauce on each individual dish of farina, and\r\nserve with cream or without dressing.\r\n\r\nFARINA WITH FRESH FRUIT.--Cook the farina as previously directed.\r\nHave some sliced yellow peaches, mellow sweet apples, or bananas in a\r\ndish, turn the farina over them, stir up lightly with a fork, and serve\r\nhot with cream.\r\n\r\nMOLDED FARINA.--Farina to be used cold may be cooked in the same\r\nmanner as before described, with two or three tablespoonfuls of sugar\r\nadded at the same time with the farina, and when done, molded in cups\r\npreviously wet with a little cold water. Serve with a dressing of fruit\r\njuice, whipped cream flavored with lemon, or mock cream flavored with\r\ncocoanut.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM GRITS.--To four parts of water boiling in the inner dish of\r\na double boiler add slowly, so as not to stop the boiling of the water,\r\none part of Graham grits. Stir until thickened, then place in the outer\r\nboiler, and steam from three to five hours. Serve hot with cream, or\r\nmold in cups previously dipped in cold water, and serve with a dressing\r\nof fruit juice. The fig sauce prepared as previously directed, is also\r\nexcellent with Graham grits.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM MUSH NO. 1.--Good flour is the first requisite for making\r\ngood Graham mush. Poor Graham flour cannot be made into first-class\r\nmush. Flour made from the best white winter wheat is perhaps the best.\r\nIt may be used either sifted or unsifted, as preferred. The proportion\r\nof flour and liquid to be used will necessarily vary somewhat with the\r\nquality of the flour, but in general, three parts water to one of flour\r\nwill be needed. Too much flour not only makes the mush too thick, but\r\ngives it an underdone taste. Stir the dried flour rapidly into boiling\r\nwater, (which should not cease to boil during the process), until a\r\nthick porridge is obtained. It is well to have it a little thinner at\r\nfirst than is desirable for serving, as it will thicken by cooking. Cook\r\nslowly at least one hour. A longer time makes it more digestible.\r\n\r\nLeft-over Graham mush is nice spread on rather shallow tins, and simply\r\nheated quickly in a hot oven.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM MUSH NO. 2.--Moisten one pint of good Graham flour with a\r\npint of warm water, or enough to make a batter thin enough to pour. (The\r\nquantity of water needed will vary a little with the fineness and\r\nquality of the flour.) Pour this batter into a quart of water boiling in\r\nthe inner cup of a double boiler. Remember to add the batter\r\nsufficiently slow, so as not to stop the boiling of the water. When\r\nthickened, put into the outer boiler, and cook for one hour.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM MUSH NO. 3.--Prepare in the same way as above, using milk or\r\npart milk in the place of water. Left-over Graham mush at breakfast,\r\nwhich has been prepared with water, is very nice if, while it is still\r\nwarm, a small quantity of hot milk is well stirred into it, and it is\r\nthen set by to be reheated in a double boiler for dinner.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM MUSH WITH DATES.--Prepare a mush as for Graham mush No. 2.\r\nWhen done, place in the dish in which the mush is to be served, some\r\nnice, fresh dates from which the stones have been removed. Pour the mush\r\nover them, and stir up lightly, taking care not to break the fruit, and\r\nserve. Raisins previously steamed, or figs steamed and cut into pieces,\r\nmay be used instead of dates. Serve hot with cream, or mold, and serve\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nPLUM PORRIDGE.--Prepare a Graham mush as previously directed, and\r\nwhen done, add to it a cup of well-steamed raisins and sufficient rich\r\nmilk to thin it to the consistency of porridge.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM APPLE MUSH.--Prepare a smooth apple sauce of rather tart\r\napples. Sweeten it slightly, and thin with boiling water. Have this\r\nmixture boiling, and add to it Graham flour, either sprinkled in dry or\r\nmoistened with water, sufficient to make a well-thickened mush. Cook,\r\nand serve hot with cream.\r\n\r\nGRANOLA MUSH.--Granola, a cooked preparation of wheat and oats,\r\nmanufactured by the Sanatarium Food Co., makes a most appetizing and\r\nquickly prepared breakfast dish. Into a quart of boiling water sprinkle\r\na pint of granola. Cook for two or three minutes, and serve hot with\r\ncream.\r\n\r\nGRANOLA FRUIT MUSH.--Prepare the mush as directed, and stir into\r\nit, when done, a large cupful of nicely-steamed, seedless raisins. Serve\r\nhot with cream. Milk may be used instead of water, if preferred.\r\n\r\nGRANOLA PEACH MUSH.--Instead of the raisins as directed in the\r\nforegoing recipe, add to the mush, when done, a pint of sliced yellow\r\npeaches. Finely-cut, mellow sweet apples, sliced bananas, and\r\nblueberries may be used in a similar way.\r\n\r\nBRAN JELLY.--Select some clean wheat bran, sprinkle it slowly into\r\nboiling water as for Graham mush, stirring briskly meanwhile with a\r\nwooden spoon, until the whole is about the consistency of thick gruel.\r\nCook slowly in a double boiler for two hours. Strain through a fine wire\r\nsieve placed over the top of a basin. When strained, reheat to boiling.\r\nThen stir into it a spoonful or so of sifted Graham flour, rubbed smooth\r\nin a little cold water. Boil up once; turn into molds previously wet in\r\ncold water, and when cool, serve with cream or fruit juice.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OAT, OR AVENA.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--The native country of the plant from which our common\r\nvarieties of the oat are derived, is unknown. Oat grains have been found\r\namong the remains of the lake-dwellers in Switzerland, and it is\r\nprobable that this plant was cultivated by the prehistoric inhabitants\r\nof Central Europe.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greeks and Romans used oats, ranking them next in value to\r\nbarley, which they esteemed above all other cereals. Although\r\nprincipally grown as food for horses, the oat, when divested of its husk\r\nand broken by a process of milling, is an exceedingly nutritious and\r\nvaluable article of diet for human beings; and there is no article of\r\nfood that has increased in general favor more rapidly in the last few\r\nyears than this grain.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch have long been famed for their large consumption of oatmeal.\r\nIt forms the staple article of diet for the peasantry, to which fact is\r\ngenerally attributed the fine physique and uniform health for which\r\nthey, as a race, are particularly noted. It is related that Dr. Johnson,\r\nof dictionary fame, who never lost an opportunity to disparage the\r\nScotch, on one occasion defined oats as, \"In Scotland, food for men; in\r\nEngland, food for horses.\" He was well answered by an indignant\r\nScotchman who replied, \"Yes; and where can you find such fine men as in\r\nScotland, or such horses as in England?\"\r\n\r\nOatmeal justly ranks high as an alimentary substance. It contains about\r\nthe same proportion of nitrogenous elements as wheat, and with the\r\nexception of maize, is richer in fatty matter than any other of the\r\ncultivated cereals. In general structure the oat resembles wheat.\r\n\r\nTo prepare oats for food, the husk, which is wholly indigestible in\r\ncharacter, must be thoroughly removed. To accomplish this, the grain is\r\nfirst kiln-dried to loosen the husk, and afterward submitted to a\r\nprocess of milling. Denuded of its integument, the nutritive part of the\r\ngrain is termed groats; broken into finer particles, it constitutes what\r\nis known as oatmeal; rolled oats, or avena, is prepared by a process\r\nwhich crushes the kernels. Oatmeal varies also in degrees of\r\ntrituration, some kinds being ground much finer than others. The more\r\nfinely-ground products are sometimes adulterated with barley meal, which\r\nis cheaper than oatmeal and less nutritious. The black specks which are\r\nsometimes found in oatmeal are particles of black oats which have been\r\nground in connection with the other.\r\n\r\nOatmeal lacks the tenacity of wheaten flour, and cannot, without the\r\naddition of some other flour, be made into light bread. It is, however,\r\nlargely consumed by the inhabitants of Scotland and the north of\r\nEngland, in the form of oatcakes. The oatmeal is mixed with water,\r\nkneaded thoroughly, then rolled into very thin cakes, and baked on an\r\niron plate or griddle suspended over a fire. So much, however, depends\r\nupon the kneading, that it is said that the common inquiry before the\r\nengagement of a domestic servant in Scotland, is whether or not she is a\r\ngood kneader of oatcakes.\r\n\r\nThe most common use of oatmeal in this country is in the form of mush or\r\nporridge. For this the coarser grades of meal are preferable. For people\r\nin health, there is no more wholesome article of diet than oatmeal\r\ncooked in this way and eaten with milk. For growing children, it is one\r\nof the best of foods, containing, as it does, a large proportion of bone\r\nand muscle-forming material, while to almost all persons who have become\r\naccustomed to its use, it is extremely palatable. The time required for\r\nits digestion is somewhat longer than that of wheaten meal prepared in\r\nthe same manner. It is apt to disagree with certain classes of\r\ndyspeptics, having a tendency to produce acidity, though it is\r\nserviceable as an article of diet in some forms of indigestion. The\r\nmanner of its preparation for the table has very much to do with its\r\nwholesomeness. Indeed, many objectionable dishes are prepared from it.\r\nOne of these, called _brose_, much used in Scotland, is made by simply\r\nstirring oatmeal into some hot liquid, as beef broth, or the water in\r\nwhich a vegetable has been boiled. The result is a coarse, pasty mass of\r\nalmost raw oatmeal, an extremely indigestible compound, the use of which\r\ncauses water brash. A preparation called _sowens_, or flummery, made by\r\nmacerating the husks of the oats in water from twenty-four to thirty-six\r\nhours, until the mixture ferments, then boiling down to the consistency\r\nof gruel, is a popular article of food among the Scotch and Welsh\r\npeasantry. When boiled down still more, so it will form a firm jelly\r\nwhen cold, the preparation is called _budrum_.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION AND COOKING.--Oatmeal requires much cooking in order to\r\nbreak its starch cells; and the coarser the meal, the longer it should\r\nbe allowed to cook. A common fault in the use of oatmeal is that it is\r\nserved in an underdone state, which makes a coarse, indigestible dish of\r\nwhat, with more lengthy preparation, would be an agreeable and\r\nnutritious food. Like most of the grains, it is best put into boiling\r\nsoft water, and allowed to cook continuously and slowly. It is greatly\r\ninjured by stirring, and it is therefore preferably cooked in a double\r\nboiler or closed steamer. If it is necessary to use an ordinary kettle,\r\nplace it on some part of the range where the contents will only simmer;\r\nor a hot brick may be placed under it to keep it from cooking too fast.\r\nIt may be cooked the day previous, and warmed for use the same as other\r\ngrains.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES.\r\n\r\nOATMEAL MUSH.--Heat a quart of water to boiling in the inner dish\r\nof a double boiler, sift into it one cup of coarse oatmeal, and boil\r\nrapidly, stirring continuously until it sets; then place in the outer\r\nboiler, the water in which should be boiling, and cook three hours or\r\nlonger. Serve with cream.\r\n\r\nOATMEAL FRUIT MUSH.--Prepare the oatmeal as directed above, and\r\nstir in lightly, when dishing for the table, some sliced mellow and\r\njuicy raw sweet apples. Strawberry apples and other slightly tart apples\r\nare likewise excellent for the purpose. Well-ripened peaches and bananas\r\nmay also be used, if care is taken to preserve the slices whole, so as\r\nto present an appetizing appearance. Both this and the plain oatmeal\r\nmush are best eaten with toasted whole-wheat wafers or some other hard\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nOATMEAL BLANCMANGE NO. 1.--Soak a cupful of coarse oatmeal over\r\nnight in a pint and a half of water. In the morning, beat the oatmeal\r\nwell with a spoon, and afterwards pass all the soluble portion through a\r\nfine strainer. Place the liquid in the inner dish of a double boiler,\r\nand cook for half an hour. Turn into cups, cool fifteen or twenty\r\nminutes, and serve warm with cream and sugar, or a dressing of fruit\r\njuice. A lemon sauce prepared as directed on page 354 likewise makes an\r\nexcellent dressing.\r\n\r\nOATMEAL BLANCMANGE NO. 2.--Take a pint of well-cooked oatmeal, add\r\nto it a pint of milk, part cream if obtainable. Beat well together, and\r\nstrain through a fine wire sieve. Turn the liquid into a saucepan, and\r\nboil for a few moments, until it is thick enough to drop from the point\r\nof a spoon; then turn into cups previously wet in cold water, and mold.\r\nServe with a dressing of fruit juice or whipped cream slightly sweetened\r\nand flavored with lemon.\r\n\r\nJELLIED OATMEAL.--Cook oatmeal or rolled oats with an additional\r\ncup or cup and a half of water, and when done, turned into cups and\r\nmold. Serve cold with hot cream.\r\n\r\nMIXED MUSH.--A cup and a half of rolled wheat, mixed with one-half\r\ncup of coarse oatmeal, and cooked the same as oatmeal, forms a mush\r\npreferred by some to oatmeal alone.\r\n\r\nROLLED OATS.--This preparation of oats should be cooked the same\r\nas oatmeal, but requires only three parts water to one of rolled oats,\r\nwhen cooked in a double boiler.\r\n\r\nOATMEAL WITH APPLE.--Cold oatmeal which has been left over may be\r\nmade into an appetising dish by molding in alternate layers with\r\nnicely-steamed tart apple, sprinkled lightly with sugar. Serve with\r\ncream. Other cooked fruit, such as cherries, evaporated peaches, and\r\napricots may be used in the same way. A very pleasing dish is made by\r\nusing between the layers ripe yellow peaches and plums sliced together,\r\nand lightly sprinkled with sugar.\r\n\r\nOATMEAL PORRIDGE.--Into a quart and a half of water, which should\r\nbe boiling in the inner dish of a double boiler, sprinkle one cup of\r\nrather coarse oatmeal. Boil rapidly, stirring meanwhile until the grain\r\nis set; then place in the outer boiler, and cook continuously for three\r\nhours or longer. A half cup of cream added just before serving, is a\r\ndesirable addition.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARLEY.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--Barley is stated by historians to be the oldest of\r\nall cultivated grains. It seems to have been the principal bread plant\r\namong the ancient Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans. The Jews especially held\r\nthe grain in high esteem, and sacred history usually uses it\r\ninterchangeably with wheat, when speaking of the fruits of the Earth.\r\n\r\nAmong the early Greeks and Romans, barley was almost the only food of\r\nthe common people and the soldiers. The flour was made into gruel, after\r\nthe following recipe: \"Dry, near the fire or in the oven, twenty pounds\r\nof barley flour, then parch it. Add three pounds of linseed meal, half a\r\npound of coriander seeds, two ounces of salt, and the water necessary.\"\r\nIf an especially delectable dish was desired, a little millet was also\r\nadded to give the paste more \"cohesion and delicacy.\" Barley was also\r\nused whole as a food, in which case it was first parched, which is still\r\nthe manner of preparing it in some parts of Palestine and many districts\r\nof India, also in the Canary Islands, where it is known as _gofio_. Of\r\nthis custom a lady from Palestine writes: \"The reapers, during barley\r\nharvest, take bunches of the half-ripe grain, and singe, or parch, it\r\nover a fire of thorns. The milk being still in the grain, it is very\r\nsweet, and is considered a delicacy.\"\r\n\r\nIn the time of Charles I, barley meal took the place of wheat almost\r\nentirely as the food of the common people in England. In some parts of\r\nEurope, India, and other Eastern countries, it is still largely consumed\r\nas the ordinary farinaceous food of the peasantry and soldiers. The\r\nearly settlers of New England also largely used it for bread making. At\r\nthe present day only a very insignificant quantity of barley is used for\r\nfood purposes in this country, and most of this in the unground state.\r\n\r\nBarley is less nutritious than wheat, and to many people is less\r\nagreeable in flavor. It is likewise somewhat inferior in point of\r\ndigestibility. Its starch cells being less soluble, they offer more\r\nresistance to the gastric juice.\r\n\r\nThere are several distinct species of barley, but that most commonly\r\ncultivated is designated as two-rowed, or two-eared barley. In general\r\nstructure, the barley grain resembles wheat and oats.\r\n\r\nSimply deprived of its outer husk, the grain is termed _Scotch milled_\r\nor _pot barley_. Subjected still further to the process by which the\r\nfibrous outer coat of the grain is removed, it constitutes what is known\r\nas _pearl barley_. Pearl barley ground into flour is known as _patent\r\nbarley_. Barley flour, owing to the fact that it contains so small a\r\nproportion of gluten, needs to be mixed with wheaten flour for\r\nbread-making purposes. When added in small quantity to whole-wheat\r\nbread, it has a tendency to keep the loaf moist, and is thought by some\r\nto improve the flavor.\r\n\r\nThe most general use made of this cereal as a food, is in the form of\r\npearl, or Scotch, barley. When well boiled, barley requires about two\r\nhours for digestion.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SUGGESTIONS FOR COOKING BARLEY.--The conditions requisite\r\nfor cooking barley are essentially the same as for oatmeal. It is best\r\ncooked slowly. Four parts of water to one of grain will be needed for\r\nsteaming or cooking in a double boiler, and from four to five hours'\r\ntime will be required, unless the grain has been previously soaked for\r\nseveral hours, in which case three hours will do. If the strong flavor\r\nof the grain is objected to, it may be soaked over night and cooked in\r\nfresh water. This method will, however, be a sacrifice of some of the\r\nnutriment contained in the grain. Barley thus soaked will require only\r\nthree parts water to one of barley for cooking.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nBAKED BARLEY.--Soak six tablespoonfuls of barley in cold water over\r\nnight. In the morning, turn off the water, and put the barley in an\r\nearthen pudding dish, and pour three and one half pints of boiling water\r\nover it; add salt if desired, and bake in a moderately quick oven about\r\ntwo and one half hours, or till perfectly soft, and all the water is\r\nabsorbed. When about half done, add four or five tablespoonfuls of sugar\r\nmixed with grated lemon peel. It may be eaten warm, but is very nice\r\nmolded in cups and served cold with cream.\r\n\r\nPEARL BARLEY WITH RAISINS.--Carefully look over and wash a cupful\r\nof pearl barley. Cook in a double boiler in five cups of boiling water\r\nfor four hours. Just before serving, add a cupful of raisins which have\r\nbeen prepared by pouring boiling water over them and allowing them to\r\nstand until swollen. Serve hot, with cream.\r\n\r\nPEARL BARLEY WITH LEMON SAUCE.--Pearl barley cooked in the same\r\nmanner, but without the addition of the raisins, is excellent served\r\nwith cream or with a lemon sauce prepared as directed on page 354.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICE.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--Rice is one of the most abundantly used and most\r\ndigestible of all the cereals. It grows wild in India, and it is\r\nprobable that this is its native home. It is, however, now cultivated in\r\nmost tropical and sub-tropical climates, and is said to supply the\r\nprincipal food for nearly one third of the human race. It is mentioned\r\nin history several hundred years before Christ. According to Soyer, an\r\nold writer on foods, the Greeks and Romans held rice in high esteem,\r\nbelieving it to be a panacea for chest and lung diseases.\r\n\r\nThe grain is so largely grown and used by the Chinese that \"fan,\" their\r\nword for rice, has come to enter into many compound words. A beggar is\r\ncalled a \"tou-fan-tee,\" that is, \"the rice-seeking one.\" The ordinary\r\nsalutation, \"Che-fan,\" which answers to our \"How do you do?\" means,\r\n\"Have you eaten your rice?\"\r\n\r\nRice requires a wet soil, and the fields in which the grain is raised,\r\nsometimes called \"paddy\" fields, are periodically irrigated. Before\r\nripening, the water is drained off, and the crop is then cut with a\r\nsickle, made into shocks, stacked, threshed, and cleaned, much like\r\nwheat. The rice kernel is inclosed within two coverings, a course outer\r\nhusk, which is easily removed, and an inner, reddish, siliceous coating.\r\n\r\n\"Paddy\" is the name given in India to the rice grain when inclosed in\r\nits husk. The same is termed \"rough rice\" in this country. The outer\r\nhusk of the rice is usually removed in the process of threshing, but the\r\ninner red skin, or hull, adheres very closely, and is removed by rubbing\r\nand pounding. The rough rice is first ground between large stones, and\r\nthen conveyed into mortars, and pounded with iron-shod pestles. Thence,\r\nby fanning and screening, the husk is fully removed, and the grain\r\ndivided into three different grades, whole, middlings, and small whole\r\ngrains, and polished ready for market. The middlings consist of the\r\nlarger broken pieces of the grain; the small rice, of the small\r\nfragments mixed with the chit of the grain. The broken rice, well dried,\r\nis sometimes ground into flour of different degrees of fineness. The\r\nsmall rice is much sweeter and somewhat superior in point of nutritive\r\nvalue to the large or head rice usually met with in commerce.\r\n\r\nRice is characterized by a large percentage of starch, and is so\r\ndeficient in other food elements that if used alone, unless consumed in\r\nvery large quantities, it will not furnish the requisite amount of\r\nnitrogenous material necessary for a perfect health food. For this\r\nreason, it is necessary to supplement its use with some other food\r\ncontaining an excess of nitrogenous elements, as peas, beans, milk, etc.\r\nAssociated with other articles rich in albuminous elements, rice is\r\nexceedingly valuable, and one of the most easily digested foods. Boiled\r\nor steamed rice requires but a little over one hour for digestion.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION AND COOKING.--Rice needs to be thoroughly washed to\r\nremove the earthy taste it is so apt to have. A good way to do this is\r\nto put it into a colander, in a deep pan of water. Rub the rice well\r\nwith the hands, lifting the colander in and out the water, and changing\r\nthe water until it is clear; then drain. In this way the grit is\r\ndeposited in the water, and the rice left thoroughly clean.\r\n\r\nThe best method of cooking rice is by steaming it. If boiled in much\r\nwater, it loses a portion of its already small percentage of nitrogenous\r\nelements. It requires much less time for cooking than any of the other\r\ngrains. Like all the dried grains and seeds, rice swells in cooking to\r\nseveral times its original bulk. When cooked, each grain of rice should\r\nbe separate and distinct, yet perfectly tender.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES.\r\n\r\nSTEAMED RICE.--Soak a cup of rice in one and a fourth cups of water\r\nfor an hour, then add a cup of milk, turn into an earthen dish suitable\r\nfor serving it from at table, and place in a steam-cooker or a covered\r\nsteamer over a kettle of boiling water, and steam for an hour. It should\r\nbe stirred with a fork occasionally, for the first ten or fifteen\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nBOILED RICE (Japanese method).--Thoroughly cleanse the rice by\r\nwashing in several waters, and soak it overnight. In the morning, drain\r\nit, and put to cook in an equal quantity of boiling water, that is, a\r\npint of water for a pint of rice. For cooking, a stewpan with tightly\r\nfitting cover should be used. Heat the water to boiling, then add the\r\nrice, and after stirring, put on the cover, which is not again to be\r\nremoved during the boiling. At first, as the water boils, steam will\r\npuff out freely from under the cover, but when the water has nearly\r\nevaporated, which will be in eight to ten minutes, according to the age\r\nand quality of the rice, only a faint suggestion of steam will be\r\nobserved, and the stewpan must then be removed from over the fire to\r\nsome place on the range, where it will not burn, to swell and dry for\r\nfifteen or twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nRice to be boiled in the ordinary manner requires two quarts of boiling\r\nwater to one cupful of rice. It should be boiled rapidly until tender,\r\nthen drained at once, and set in a moderate oven to become dry. Picking\r\nand lifting lightly occasionally with a fork will make it more flaky and\r\ndry. Care must be taken, however, not to mash the rice grains.\r\n\r\nRICE WITH FIG SAUCE.--Steam a cupful of best rice as directed\r\nabove, and when done, serve with a fig sauce prepared as directed on\r\npage 89. Dish a spoonful of the fig sauce with each saucer of rice, and\r\nserve with plenty of cream. Rice served in this way requires no sugar\r\nfor dressing, and is a most wholesome breakfast dish.\r\n\r\nORANGE RICE.--Wash and steam the rice according to directions\r\nalready given. Prepare some oranges by separating into sections and\r\ncutting each section in halves, removing the seeds and all the white\r\nportion. Sprinkle the oranges lightly with sugar, and let them stand\r\nwhile the rice is cooking. Serve a portion of the orange on each\r\nsaucerful of rice.\r\n\r\nRICE WITH RAISINS.--Carefully wash a cupful of rice, soak it, and\r\ncook as directed for Steamed Rice. After the rice has began to swell,\r\nbut before it has softened, stir into it lightly, using a fork for the\r\npurpose, a cupful of raisins, or Zante currents. Serve with cream.\r\n\r\nRICE WITH PEACHES.--Steam the rice as previously directed, and when\r\ndone, serve with cream and a nicely ripened peach pared and sliced on\r\neach individual dish.\r\n\r\nBROWNED RICE.--Spread a cupful of rice on a shallow baking tin, and\r\nput into a moderately hot oven to brown. It will need to be stirred\r\nfrequently to prevent burning and to secure a uniformity of color. Each\r\nrice kernel, when sufficiently browned, should be of a yellowish brown,\r\nabout the color of ripened wheat. Steam the same as directed for\r\nordinary rice, using only two cups of water for each cup of browned\r\nrice, and omitting the preliminary soaking. When properly cooked, each\r\nkernel will be separated, dry, and mealy. Rice prepared in this manner\r\nis undoubtedly more digestible than when cooked without browning.\r\n\r\n\r\nRYE.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--Rye is much more largely grown and used in European\r\ncountries that in America. In appearance it closely resembles wheat,\r\nalthough somewhat darker in color and smaller in size. Bread made from\r\nrye constitutes the staple food of the people in many parts of Europe.\r\nIn nutritive value such bread nearly equals that made from wheat, but it\r\nhas an acid taste not relished by persons unaccustomed to its use.\r\n\r\nRye is found in market deprived of its husk and crushed or rolled, and\r\nalso in the form of meal and flour.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nROLLED RYE.--Into three parts water boiling in the inner dish of a\r\ndouble boiler, stir one part rolled rye. Boil rapidly until set,\r\nstirring meanwhile, then place in the outer boiler, and cook for three\r\nor more hours.\r\n\r\nRYE MUSH.--Stir a cupful of rye meal to a smooth batter with a\r\ncupful of water, then turn it slowly into three cupfuls of water, which\r\nshould be boiling on the range, in the inner dish of a double boiler.\r\nStir until thickened, then place in the outer boiler, and cook for an\r\nhour or longer.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIZE, OR INDIAN CORN.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--There can be little doubt that maize is of American\r\norigin. The discoverers of the new world found it cultivated by the\r\naborigines, and from the fact that corn was the generic term then\r\nlargely used to designate grain (in old English, \"corn\" means grain),\r\nthey named it \"Indian corn.\" Since that time it has been carried to\r\nnearly every part of the globe, and probably it is more extensively used\r\nthan any other one of the cereals, with the exception of rice. This is\r\nundoubtedly due to the fact that it is the most prolific of the grains,\r\nand is adapted to the widest range of climate.\r\n\r\nMaize was the chief food of the slaves of Brazil, as it used to be of\r\nthose in our own Southern States, and is very largely consumed in Mexico\r\nand Peru. It was used very little in Europe until the Irish famine in\r\n1847; since then, it has become a staple food with the poorer classes.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of corn are almost too numerous to be counted. For general\r\npurposes, however, they may be classified as field corn, sweet corn, and\r\npop corn.\r\n\r\nCorn is characterized by an excess of fatty matter, containing upwards\r\nof three times the amount of that element to be found in wheat. Corn\r\nrequires stronger powers of digestion than wheat, and is unsuited to\r\nsome stomachs.\r\n\r\nThe skin of the corn kernel is thin, and when subjected to milling\r\nprocesses, is included in the grinding. When well ground, it can be\r\ndigested, with the exception of the siliceous coating.\r\n\r\nSweet corn and some of the field varieties, form a nutritious and\r\nfavorite food while green. The mature grain is used in many forms. The\r\nwhole grain, hulled, is an agreeable food. Hulled, broken, or split to\r\nvarious degrees of fineness, it is known according to the size to which\r\nthe grain has been reduced as hominy, fine hominy, or grits; or, if\r\nfiner still, as samp. Subjected to a process of still finer trituration,\r\nit forms meal. Cornstarch consists of the farinaceous portions of the\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nOn account of the large proportion of fatty matter contained in maize,\r\nit acquires, if kept for some time and unpleasant, rancid taste,\r\noccasioned by the usual change which takes place in fat when exposed to\r\nthe atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe new process granular meal, which is prepared from corn dried for a\r\nlong period before grinding, becomes rank less quickly than that ground\r\nin the old way.\r\n\r\nMaize meal is very largely consumed in the form of mush or porridge.\r\nThis, in Ireland, is termed \"stirabout;\" in Italy it is called\r\n\"polenta;\" and in British Honduras it is known as \"corn lob.\"\r\n\r\nGENERAL SUGGESTIONS FOR COOKING.--Most of the various preparations\r\nfrom maize require prolonged cooking to render them wholesome; this is\r\nequally true respecting mushes prepared from samp or meal, a dish which\r\nunfortunately some cook in bygone days saw fit to term \"hasty pudding.\"\r\nUnthinking people since, supposing it to have been so named because of\r\nthe little time required to cook it, have commonly prepared it in\r\nfifteen or twenty minutes, whereas from one to two hours, or even\r\nlonger, are necessary to cook it properly. Hulled corn, hominy, and\r\ngrits, all require prolonged cooking. The time for cooking these\r\npreparations may be somewhat lessened if they are previously soaked over\r\nnight. They should, however, be cooked in the same water in which they\r\nare soaked.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nCORN MEAL MUSH.--stir together one pint of cornmeal, one\r\ntablespoonful of flour, and one pint of cold milk. Turn this slowly,\r\nstirring well meanwhile, into one quart of boiling water, which should\r\nnot cease to boil during the introduction of the batter. Cook three or\r\nfour hours. If milk is not obtainable, water alone may be used, in which\r\ncase two tablespoonfuls of flour will be needed. Cook in a double\r\nboiler.\r\n\r\nCORN MEAL MUSH WITH FRUIT.--Mush prepared in the above manner may\r\nhave some well-steamed raisins or chopped figs added to it just before\r\nserving.\r\n\r\nCORN MEAL CUBES.--Left-over corn meal mush may be made into an\r\nappetizing dish by first slicing into rather thick slices, then cutting\r\ninto cubes about one inch squares. Put the cubes into a tureen and turn\r\nover them a quantity of hot milk or cream. Cover the dish, let them\r\nstand until thoroughly heated through, then serve.\r\n\r\nBROWNED MUSH.--Slice cold corn meal mush rather thin, brush each\r\nslice with thick, sweet cream, and brown in a moderate oven until well\r\nheated through.\r\n\r\nSAMP.--Use one part of samp to four and one half parts of boiling\r\nwater. It is the best plan to reserve enough of the water to moisten the\r\nsamp before adding it to the boiling water, as it is much less likely to\r\ncook in lumps. Boil rapidly, stirring continuously, until the mush has\r\nwell set, then slowly for from two to three hours.\r\n\r\nCEREALINE FLAKES.--Into one measure of boiling liquid stir an equal\r\nmeasure of cerealine flakes, and cook in a double boiler from one half\r\nto three fourths of an hour.\r\n\r\nHULLED CORN.--_To Hull the Corn._--Put enough wood ashes into a\r\nlarge kettle to half fill it; then nearly fill with hot water, and boil\r\nten minutes. Drain off the water from the ashes, turn it into a kettle,\r\nand pour in four quarts of clean, shelled field corn, white varieties\r\npreferred. Boil till the hulls rub off. Skim the corn out of the lye\r\nwater, and put it into a tub of fresh cold water. To remove the hulls,\r\nscrub the corn well with a new stiff brush broom kept for the purpose,\r\nchanging the water often. Put through half a dozen or more waters, and\r\nthen take the corn out by handfuls, rubbing each well between the hands\r\nto loosen the remaining hulls, and drop again into clear water. Pick out\r\nall hulls. Cleanse the corn through several more waters if it is to be\r\ndried and kept before using. Well hulled corn is found in the markets.\r\n\r\n_To Cook._--If it is to be cooked at once, it should be parboiled in\r\nclear water twice, and then put into new water and cooked till tender.\r\nIt should be nearly or quite dry when done. It may be served with milk\r\nor cream.\r\n\r\nCOARSE HOMINY.--For coarse hominy use four parts of water or milk\r\nand water to one of grain. It is best steamed or cooked in a double\r\nboiler, though it may be boiled in a kettle over a slow fire. The only\r\nobjection to this method is the need of frequent stirring to prevent\r\nsticking, which breaks and mashes the hominy. From four to five hours'\r\nslow cooking will be necessary, unless the grain has been previously\r\nsoaked; then about one hour less will be required.\r\n\r\nFINE HOMINY OR GRITS.--This preparation is cooked in the same\r\nmanner as the foregoing, using three and one half or four parts of water\r\nto one of the grain. Four or five hours will be necessary for cooking\r\nthe unsoaked grits.\r\n\r\nPOPPED CORN.--The small, translucent varieties of maize known as\r\n\"pop corn,\" possessed the property, when gently roasted, of bursting\r\nopen, or turning inside out, a process which is owing to the following\r\nfacts: Corn contains an excess of fatty matter. By proper means this fat\r\ncan be separated from the grain, and it is then a thick, pale oil. When\r\noils are heated sufficiently in a vessel closed from the air, they are\r\nturned into gas, which occupies many times the bulk of the oil. When pop\r\ncorn is gradually heated, and made so hot that the oil inside of the\r\nkernel turns to gas, being unable to escape through the hull of the\r\nkernel, the pressure finally becomes strong enough to burst the grain,\r\nand the explosion is so violent as to shatter it in a most curious\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nPopped corn forms an excellent food, the starch of the grain being will\r\ncooked. It should, however, be eaten in connection with other food at\r\nmealtime, and not as a delicacy between meals. Ground pop corn is\r\nconsidered a delectable dish eaten with milk or cream; it also forms the\r\nbase of several excellent puddings.\r\n\r\nTo pop the corn, shell and place in a wire \"popper\" over a bed of bright\r\ncoals, or on the top of a hot stove; stir or shake continuously, so that\r\neach kernel may be subjected to the same degree of heat on all sides,\r\nuntil it begins to burst open. If a popper is not attainable, a common\r\niron skillet covered tightly, and very lightly oiled on the bottom, may\r\nbe used for the purpose. The corn must be very dry to begin with, and if\r\ngood, nearly every kernel will pop open nicely. It should be used within\r\ntwenty-four hours after popping.\r\n\r\n\r\nMACARONI.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--Macaroni is a product of wheat prepared from a hard,\r\nclean, glutenous grain. The grain is ground into a meal called\r\n_semolina_, from which the bran is excluded. This is made into a tasty\r\ndough by mixing with hot water in the proportion of two thirds\r\n_semolina_ to one third water. The dough after being thoroughly mixed is\r\nput into a shallow vat and kneaded and rolled by machinery. When well\r\nrolled, it is made to assume varying shapes by being forced by a\r\npowerful plunger through the perforated head of strong steel or iron\r\ncylinders arranged above a fire, so that the dough is partially baked as\r\nit issues from the holes. It is afterwards hung over rods or laid upon\r\nframes covered with cloth, and dried. It is called by different names\r\naccording to its shape. If in the shape of large, hollow cylinders, it\r\nis _macaroni;_ if smaller in diameter, it is _spaghetti;_ if fine,\r\n_vermicelli;_ if the paste is cut into fancy patterns, it is termed\r\n_pasta d'Italia_.\r\n\r\nMacaroni was formerly made only in Italy, but at present is manufactured\r\nto a considerable extent in the United States. The product, however, is\r\nin general greatly inferior to that imported from Italy, owing to the\r\ndifference in the character of the wheat from which it is made, the\r\nItalian macaroni being produced from a hard, semi-translucent wheat,\r\nrich in nitrogenous elements, and which is only grown successfully in a\r\nhot climate. Like all cereal foods, macaroni should be kept in a\r\nperfectly dry storeroom.\r\n\r\nTO SELECT MACARONI.--Good macaroni will keep in good condition for\r\nyears. It is rough, elastic, and hard; while the inferior article is\r\nsmooth, soft, breaks easily, becomes moldy with keeping. Inferior\r\nmacaroni contains a large percentage of starch, and but a small amount\r\nof gluten. When put into hot water, it assumes a white, pasty\r\nappearance, and splits in cooking. Good macaroni when put into hot water\r\nabsorbs a portion of the water, swells to nearly double its size, but\r\nperfectly retains its shape. Inferior macaroni is usually sold a few\r\ncents cheaper per pound than the genuine article. It contains a much\r\nsmaller amount of gluten. The best quality of any shape one pleases can\r\nbe bought in most markets for ten or fifteen cents a pound.\r\n\r\nTO PREPARE AND COOK MACARONI.--Do not wash macaroni. If dusty, wipe\r\nwith a clean, dry cloth. Break into pieces of convenient size. Always\r\nput to cook in boiling liquid, taking care to have plenty of water in\r\nthe saucepan (as it absorbs a large quantity), and cook until tender.\r\nThe length of time required may vary from twenty minutes, if fresh, to\r\none hour if stale. When tender, turn into a colander and drain, and pour\r\ncold water through it to prevent the tubes from sticking together. The\r\nfluid used for cooking may be water, milk, or a mixture of both; also\r\nsoup stock, tomato juice, or any preferred liquid.\r\n\r\nMacaroni serves as an important adjunct to the making of various soups,\r\nand also forms the basis of other palatable dishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nHOME-MADE MACARONI.--To four cupfuls of flour, add one egg well\r\nbeaten, and enough water to make a dough that can be rolled. Roll thin\r\non a breadboard and cut into strips. Dry in the sun. The best\r\narrangement for this purpose is a wooden frame to which a square of\r\ncheese-cloth has been tightly tacked, upon which the macaroni may be\r\nlaid in such a way as not to touch, and afterwards covered with a\r\ncheese-cloth to keep off the dust during the drying.\r\n\r\nBOILED MACARONI.--Break sticks of macaroni into pieces about an\r\ninch in length, sufficient to fill a large cup; put it into boiling\r\nwater and cook until tender. When done, drained thoroughly, then add a\r\npint of milk, part cream if it can be afforded, a little salt and one\r\nwell-beaten egg; stir over the fire until it thickens, and serve hot.\r\n\r\nMACARONI WITH CREAM SAUCE.--Cook the macaroni as directed in the\r\nproceeding, and serve with a cream sauce prepared by heating a scant\r\npint of rich milk to boiling, in a double boiler. When boiling, add a\r\nheaping tablespoonful of flour, rubbed smoothed in a little milk and one\r\nfourth teaspoonful of salt. If desired, the sauce may be flavored by\r\nsteeping in the milk before thickening for ten or fifteen minutes, a\r\nslice of onion or a few bits of celery, and then removing with a fork.\r\n\r\nMACARONI WITH TOMATO SAUCE.--Break a dozen sticks of macaroni into\r\ntwo-inch lengths, and drop into boiling milk and water, equal parts. Let\r\nit boil for an hour, or until perfectly tender. In the meantime prepare\r\nthe sauce by rubbing a pint of stewed or canned tomatoes through a\r\ncolander to remove all seeds and fragments. Heat to boiling, thicken\r\nwith a little flour; a tablespoonful to the pint will be about the\r\nrequisite proportion. Add salt and if desired, a half cup of very thin\r\nsweet cream. Dish the macaroni into individual dishes, and serve with a\r\nsmall quantity of the sauce poured over each dish.\r\n\r\nMACARONI BAKED WITH GRANOLA.--Break macaroni into pieces about an\r\ninch in length sufficient to fill a large cup, and cook until tender in\r\nboiling milk and water. When done, drain and put a layer of the macaroni\r\nin the bottom of an earthen pudding dish, and sprinkle over it a scant\r\nteaspoonful of granola. Add a second and third layer and sprinkle each\r\nwith granola; then turn over the whole a custard sauce prepared by\r\nmixing together a pint of milk, the well beaten yolks of two eggs or one\r\nwhole egg, and one-fourth of a teaspoonful of salt. Care should be taken\r\nto arrange the macaroni in layers loosely, so that the sauce will\r\nreadily permeate the whole. Bake for a few minutes only, until the\r\ncustard has well set, and serve.\r\n\r\nEGGS AND MACARONI.--Break fifteen whole sticks of macaroni into\r\ntwo-inch lengths, and put to cook in boiling water. While the macaroni\r\nis cooking, boil the yolks of four eggs until mealy. The whole egg may\r\nbe used if caught so the yolks are mealy in the whites simply jellied,\r\nnot hardened. When the macaroni is done, drain and put a layer of it\r\narranged loosely in the bottom of an earthen pudding dish. Slice the\r\ncooked egg yolks and spread a layer of them over the macaroni. Fill the\r\ndish with alternate layers of macaroni and egg, taking care to have the\r\ntop layer of macaroni. Pour over the whole a cream sauce prepared as\r\nfollows: Heat one and three fourths cup of rich milk to boiling, add one\r\nfourth teaspoonful of salt and one heaping spoonful of flour rubbed\r\nsmooth in a little cold milk. Cook until thickened, then turn over the\r\nmacaroni. Sprinkle the top with grated bread crumbs, and brown in a hot\r\noven for eight or ten minutes. Serve hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE TOPICS.\r\n\r\n    Sir Isaac Newton, when writing his grail work, \"Principia,\" lived\r\n    wholly upon a vegetable, diet.\r\n\r\n    ROBERT COLLYER once remarked; \"One great reason why I never had a\r\n    really sick day in my life was that as boy I lived on oatmeal and\r\n    milk and brown bread, potatoes and a bit of meat when I could get\r\n    it, and then oatmeal again.\"\r\n\r\n    HOT-WEATHER DIET.--The sultry period of our summer, although\r\n    comparatively slight and of short duration, is nevertheless felt by\r\n    some people to be extremely oppressive, but this is mainly due to\r\n    the practice of eating much animal food or fatty matters, conjoined\r\n    as it often is with the habit of drinking freely of fluids\r\n    containing more or less alcoholics. Living on cereals, vegetables,\r\n    and fruits, and abstaining from alcoholic drinks, the same persons\r\n    would probably enjoy the temperature, and be free from the thirst\r\n    which is the natural result of consuming needlessly heating\r\n    food.--_Sir Henry Thompson._\r\n\r\n    _Mistress_ (arranging for dinner)--\"Didn't the macaroni come from\r\n    the grocer's, Bridget?\"\r\n\r\n    _Bridget_--\"Yis, mum, but oi sint it back. Every won av thim leetle\r\n    stims wuz impty.\"\r\n\r\n    Some years since, a great railroad corporation in the West, having\r\n    occasion to change the gauge of its road throughout a distance of\r\n    some five hundred miles, employed a force of 3,000 workmen upon the\r\n    job, who worked from very early in the morning until late at night.\r\n    Alcoholic drinks were strictly prohibited, but a thin gruel made of\r\n    oatmeal and water was kept on hand and freely partaken of by the men\r\n    to quench their thirst. The results were admirable; not a single\r\n    workmen gave out under the severe strain, and not one lost a day\r\n    from sickness. Thus this large body of men were kept well and in\r\n    perfect strength and spirits, and the work was done in considerably\r\n    less time than that counted on for its completion.\r\n\r\n    In Scotch households oatmeal porridge is as inevitable as breakfast\r\n    itself, except perhaps on Sundays, as this anecdote will illustrate.\r\n    A mother and child were passing along a street in Glasgow, when this\r\n    conversation was overheard:--\r\n\r\n    \"What day is the morn, mither?\"\r\n\r\n    \"Sabbath, laddie.\"\r\n\r\n    \"An' will wi hae tea to breakfast, mither?\"\r\n\r\n    \"Aye, laddie, gin we're spared.\"\r\n\r\n    \"An' gin we're no spared, will we hae parrich?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBREADSTUFFS AND BREADMAKING\r\n\r\nAlthough the grains form most nutritious and palatable dishes when\r\ncooked in their unground state, this is not always the most convenient\r\nway of making; use of them. Mankind from earliest antiquity has sought\r\nto give these wonderful products of nature a more portable and\r\nconvenient form by converting them into what is termed bread, a word\r\nderived from the verb _bray_, to pound, beat, or grind small, indicative\r\nof the ancient manner of preparing the grain for making bread. Probably\r\nthe earliest form of bread was simply the whole grain moistened and then\r\nexposed to heat. Afterward, the grains were roasted and ground, or\r\npounded between stones, and unleavened bread was made by mixing this\r\ncrude flour with water, and baking in the form of cakes. Among the many\r\ningenious arrangements used by the ancients for baking this bread, was a\r\nsort of portable oven in shape something like a pitcher, in the inside\r\nof which a fire was made. When the oven was well heated, a paste made of\r\nmeal and water was applied to the outside. Such bread was baked very\r\nquickly and taken off in small, thin sheets like wafers. A flat cake was\r\nthe common form in which most of the bread of olden times was baked;\r\nbeing too brittle to be cut with a knife, the common mode of dividing it\r\nwas by breaking and hence the expression \"breaking bread\" so common in\r\nScripture.\r\n\r\nVarious substances have been and are employed for making this needful\r\narticle. Until the last few decades, barley was the grain most\r\nuniversally used. Chestnuts, ground to a flour, are made into bread in\r\nregions where these nuts abound. Quite recently, an immense peanut crop\r\nin the Southern States was utilized for bread-making purposes. In\r\nancient times, the Thracians made to bread from a flour made from the\r\n_water coltran_, a prickly root of triangular form. In Syria, mulberries\r\nwere dried and grounded to flour. Rice, moss, palm tree piths, and\r\nstarch producing roots are used by different nationalities in the\r\npreparation of bread. In many parts of Sweden, bread is made from dried\r\nfish, using one half fish flour and one half barley flour; and in\r\nwinter, flour made from the bark of trees is added. Desiccated tomatoes,\r\npotatoes, and other vegetables are also mixed with the cereals for\r\nbread-making. In India, the lower classes make their bread chiefly from\r\nmillet. Moss bread is made in Iceland from the reindeer moss, which\r\ntoward autumn becomes soft, tender, and moist, with a taste like wheat\r\nbran. It contains a large quantity of starch, and the Icelanders gather,\r\ndry, pulverize it, and thus prepare it for bread-making. The ancient\r\nEgyptians often made their bread from equal parts of the whole grain and\r\nmeal.\r\n\r\nThe breadstuff's most universally used among civilized nations at the\r\npresent time are barley, rye, oats, maize, buckwheat, rice, and wheat,\r\nof which the last has acquired a decided preference.\r\n\r\nIf made in the proper manner and from suitable material, bread is, with\r\nthe exception of milk, the article best fitted for the nourishment of\r\nthe body, and if need be, can supply the place of all other foods. Good\r\nbread does not cloy the appetite as do many other articles of food, and\r\nthe simplest bill of fare which includes light, wholesome bread, is far\r\nmore satisfying than an elaborate meal without it. Were the tables of\r\nour land supplied with good, nutritious, well-baked bread, there would\r\nbe less desire for cake, pastry, and other indigestible particles,\r\nwhich, under the present system of cookery, are allowed to compensate\r\nfor the inferior quality and poor preparation of more wholesome foods.\r\n\r\nBread has been proverbially styled the \"staff of life.\" In nearly all\r\nancient languages the entomology of the word \"bread\" signifies all,\r\nindicating; that the bread of earlier periods was in truth what it\r\nshould be at the present time,--a staff upon which all the functions of\r\nlife might with safety depend.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the important part bread was designed to play in the\r\neconomy of life, it would be hardly possible to mention another aliment\r\nwhich so universally falls below the standard either through the manner\r\nof its preparation or in the material used.\r\n\r\nBread, to answer the requirements of a good, wholesome article of food,\r\nbeside being palatable, must be light, porous, and friable, so that it\r\ncan be easily insalivated and digested. It should not contain\r\ningredients which will in any way be injurious if taken into the system,\r\nbut should contain as many as possible of the elements of nutrition.\r\nWheat, the substance from which bread is most generally made, contains\r\nall the necessary food elements in proper proportions to meet the\r\nrequirements of nutrition, and bread should also contain them. The\r\nflour, however, must be made from the whole grain of the wheat, with the\r\nexception of the outer husk.\r\n\r\nWhat is ordinarily termed fine flour has a large part of the most\r\nnutritive properties of the grain left out, and unless this deficiency\r\nis made up by other foods, the use of bread made from such material will\r\nleave the most vital tissues of the body poorly nourished, and tend to\r\nproduce innumerable bad results. People who eat bread made from fine\r\nwhite flour naturally crave the food elements which have been eliminated\r\nfrom the wheat, and are thus led to an excessive consumption of meat,\r\nand the nerve-starvation and consequent irritability thus induced may\r\nalso lead to the use of alcoholic drinks. We believe that one of the\r\nstrongest barriers women could erect against the inroads of intemperance\r\nwould be to supply the tables of the land with good bread made from\r\nflour of the entire wheat.\r\n\r\nThe superiority of bread made from the entire wheat or unbolted meal has\r\nbeen attested by many notable examples in history. In England, under the\r\nadministration of William Pitt, there was for several years such a\r\nscarcity of wheat that to make it hold out longer, a law was passed by\r\nParliament that the army should be supplied with bread made of unbolted\r\nflour. This occasioned much murmuring on the part of the soldiers, but\r\nnevertheless the health of the army improved so greatly as to be a\r\nsubject of surprise. The officers and the physicians at last publicly\r\ndeclared that the soldiers had never before been so robust and healthy.\r\n\r\nAccording to the eminent Prof. Liebig, whole-wheat bread contains 60 per\r\ncent more of the phosphate or bone forming material than does meat, and\r\n200 per cent more gluten than white bread. To the lack of these elements\r\nin a food so generally used as white flour bread, is undoubtedly due the\r\ngreat prevalence of early decaying teeth, rickets, and other bone\r\ndiseases. Indeed, so many are the evils attendant upon a continued use\r\nof fine flour bread that we can in a great measure agree with a writer\r\nof the last century who says, in a quaint essay still to be seen at the\r\nBritish Museum, that \"fine flour, spirituous liquors, and strong\r\nale-house beer are the foundations of almost all the poverty and all the\r\nevils that affect the labouring part of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nBread made from the entire wheat is looked upon with far more favor than\r\nformerly, and it is no longer necessary to use the crude products of the\r\ngrain for its manufacture, since modern invention has worked such a\r\nrevolution in milling processes that it is now possible to obtain a fine\r\nflour containing all the nutritious elements of the grain. The old-time\r\nmillstone has been largely superceded by machinery with which the entire\r\ngrain may be reduced to fine flour without the loss of any of its\r\nvaluable properties. To be sure, the manufacture of fine white flour of\r\nthe old sort, is still continued, and doubtless will be continued so\r\nlong as color takes precedence over food value. The improved processes\r\nof milling have, however, enabled the millers to utilize a much larger\r\nproportion of the nutritious elements of the grain than formerly, and\r\nstill preserve that whiteness is so pleasing to many consumers. Although\r\nit is true that there are brands of white flour which possess a large\r\npercentage of the nutrient properties of the wheat, it is likewise true\r\nthat flour which contains _all_ the nutritive elements is _not_ white.\r\n\r\nOf flours made from the entire grain there are essentially two different\r\nvarieties, that which is termed _unbolted wheat meal_ or _Graham_ flour,\r\nand that called _wheat-berry, whole-wheat_, or _entire-wheat_ flour. The\r\nprincipal difference between the two consists in the preliminary\r\ntreatment of the wheat kernel before reduction, Graham flour containing\r\nmore or less of the flinty bran, which is wholly innutritious and to a\r\nsensitive stomach somewhat irritating. In the manufacture of _whole_ or\r\n_entire_-wheat flour, the outer, flinty bran is first removed by special\r\nmachinery, and then the entire grain pulverized, by some of approved\r\nmethod, to different grades of fineness. The absence of the indigestible\r\nbran renders the entire-wheat flour superior in this respect to Graham,\r\nthough for many persons the latter is to preferred.\r\n\r\nHOW TO SELECT FLOUR.--The first requisite in the making of good\r\nbread is good flour. The quality of a brand of flour will of course\r\ndepend much upon the kind of grain from which it is prepared--whether\r\nnew or old, perfect, or deteriorated by rust, mold, or exposure, and\r\nalso upon the thoroughness with which it has been cleansed from dust,\r\nchaff, and all foreign substances, as well as upon the method by which\r\nit is ground. It is not possible to judge with regard to all these\r\nparticulars by the appearance of the flour, but in general, good flour\r\nwill be sweet, dry, and free from any sour or musty smell or taste. Take\r\nup a handful, and if it falls from the hand light and elastic, it is\r\npretty sure to be good. If it will retain the imprint of the fingers\r\nand falls and a compact mass or a damp, clammy, or sticky to the touch,\r\nit is by no means the best. When and knead a little of it between the\r\nfingers; if it works soft and sticky, it is poor. Good flour, when made\r\ninto dough, is elastic, and will retain its shape. This elastic property\r\nof good flour is due to the gluten which it contains. The more gluten\r\nand the stronger it is, the better the flour. The gluten of good flour\r\nwill swell to several times its original bulk, while that of poor flour\r\nwill not.\r\n\r\nIn buying white flour, do not select that which is pure white with a\r\nbluish tinge, but that which is of a creamy, yellowish-white tint. While\r\nthe kinds of flour that contain the entire nutritive properties of the\r\nwheat will necessarily be darker in color, we would caution the reader\r\nnot to suppose that because flour is dark in color it is for that reason\r\ngood, and rich in nutritive elements. There are many other causes from\r\nwhich flour may be dark, such as the use of uncleansed or dark varieties\r\nof wheat, and the large admixture of bran and other grains; many\r\nunscrupulous millers and flour dealers make use of this fact to palm off\r\nupon their unsuspecting customers an inferior article. Much of the\r\nso-called Graham flour is nothing more than poor flour mixed with bran,\r\nand is in every way inferior to good white flour. Fine flour or made\r\nfrom the entire wheat may generally be distinguished from a spurious\r\narticle by taking a small portion into the mouth and chewing it. Raw\r\nflour made from the entire grain has a sweet taste, and a rich, nutty\r\nflavor the same as that experienced in chewing a whole grain of wheat,\r\nand produces a goodly quantity of gum or gluten, while a spurious\r\narticle tastes flat and insipid like starch, or has a bitter, pungent\r\ntaste consequent upon the presence of impurities. This bitter taste is\r\nnoticeable in bread made from such flour. A given quantity of poor flour\r\nwill not make as much bread as the same quantity of good flour, so that\r\nadulteration may also be detected in this way. Doubtless much of the\r\nprejudice against the use of whole-wheat flour has arisen from the use\r\nof a spurious article.\r\n\r\nAs it is not always possible to determine accurately without the aid of\r\nchemistry and a microscope whether flour is genuine, the only safe way\r\nis to purchase the product of reliable mills.\r\n\r\nIt is always best to obtain a small quantity of flour first, and put it\r\nto the test of bread-making; then, if satisfactory, purchase that brand\r\nso long as it proves good. It is true economy to buy a flour known to be\r\ngood even though it may cost more than some others. It is not wise to\r\npurchase too large a quantity at once unless one has exceptionally good\r\nfacilities for storage, as flour is subject to many deteriorating\r\ninfluences. It is estimated that a barrel of good flour contains\r\nsufficient bread material to last one person one year; and from this\r\nstandard it can be easily estimated in what proportion it is best to\r\npurchase.\r\n\r\nTO KEEP FLOUR.--Flour should always be kept in a tight receptacle,\r\nand in a cool, dry, well-ventilated place. It should not be allowed to\r\nremain in close proximity to any substances of strong odor, as it very\r\nreadily absorbs odors and gaseous impurities. A damp atmosphere will\r\ncause it to absorb moisture, and as a result the gluten will lose some\r\nof its tenacity and become sticky, and bread made from the flour will be\r\ncoarser and inferior in quality. Flour which has absorbed dampness from\r\nany cause should be sifted into a large tray, spread out thin and\r\nexposed to the hot sun, or placed in a warming oven for a few hours.\r\n\r\nDELETERIOUS ADULTERATIONS OF FLOUR.--Besides the fraud frequently\r\npracticed of compounding whole-wheat flour from inferior mill products,\r\nwhite flour is sometimes adulterated--more commonly, however, in\r\nEuropean countries that in this--with such substances as alum, ground\r\nrice, plaster of Paris, and whiting. Alum is doubtless the most commonly\r\nused of all these substances, for the reason that it gives the bread a\r\nwhiter color and causes the flour to absorb and retain a larger amount\r\nof water than it would otherwise hold. This enables the user to make,\r\nfrom an inferior brand of flour, bread which resembles that made from a\r\nbetter quality. Such adulteration is exceedingly injurious, as are other\r\nmineral substances used for a similar purpose.\r\n\r\nThe presence of alum in flour or bread may be detected in the following\r\nway: Macerate a half slice of bread in three or four tablespoonfuls of\r\nwater; strain off the water, and add to it twenty drops of a strong\r\nsolution of logwood, made either from the fresh chips or the extract.\r\nThen add a large teaspoonful of a strong solution of carbonate of\r\nammonium. If alum is present, the mixture will change from pink to\r\nlavender blue.\r\n\r\nThe _Journal of Trade_ gives the following simple mode of testing for\r\nthis adulterant: \"Persons can test the bread they buy for themselves, by\r\ntaking a piece of it and soaking it in water. Take this water and mix it\r\nwith an equal part of fresh milk, and if the bread contains alum, the\r\nmixture will coagulate. If a better test is required, boil the mixture,\r\nand it will form perfect clot.\"\r\n\r\nWhiting can be detected by dipping the ends of the thumb and forefinger\r\nin sweet oil and rubbing the flour between them. If whiting is present,\r\nthe flour will become sticky like putty, and remain white; whereas pure\r\nflour, when so rubbed, becomes darker in color, but not sticky. Plaster\r\nof Paris, chalk, and other alkaline adulterants may be detected by a few\r\ndrops of lemon juice: if either be present, effervescence will take\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY OF BREAD-MAKING.--Good flour alone will not insure good\r\nbread. As much depends upon its preparation as upon the selection of\r\nmaterial; for the very best of flour may be transformed into the poorest\r\nof bread through improper or careless preparation. Good bread cannot be\r\nproduced at random. It is not the fruit of any luck or chance, but the\r\npractical result of certain fixed laws and principles to which all may\r\nconform.\r\n\r\nThe first step in the conversion of flour into bread is to incorporate\r\nwith it a given amount of fluid, by which each atom of flour is\r\nsurrounded with a thin film of moisture, in order to hydrate the starch,\r\nto dissolve the sugar and albumen, and to develop the adhesiveness of\r\nthe gluten, thus binding the whole into one coherent mass termed\r\n_dough_, a word from a verb meaning to wet or moisten. If nothing more\r\nbe done, and this simple form of dough be baked, the starch granules\r\nwill be ruptured by the heat and thus properly prepared for food; but\r\nthe moistening will have developed the glue-like property of the gluten\r\nto the extent of firmly cementing the particles of flour together, so\r\nthat the mass will be hard and tough, and almost incapable of\r\nmastication. If, however, the dough be thoroughly kneaded, rolled very\r\nthin, made into small cakes, and then quickly baked with sufficient\r\nheat, the result will be a brittle kind of bread termed unleavened\r\nbread, which, although it requires a lengthy process of mastication, is\r\nmore wholesome and digestible than soft bread, which is likely to be\r\nswallowed insufficiently insalivated.\r\n\r\nThe gluten of wheat flour, beside being adhesive, is likewise remarkably\r\nelastic. This is the reason why wheat flour is much more easily made\r\ninto light bread than the product of other cereals which contain less or\r\na different quality of gluten. Now if while the atoms of flour are\r\nsupplied with moisture, they are likewise supplied with some form of\r\ngaseous substance, the elastic walls of the gluten cells will become\r\ndistended, causing the dough to \"rise,\" or grow in bulk, and at the same\r\ntime become light, or porous, in texture.\r\n\r\nThis making of bread light is usually accomplished by the introduction\r\nof air into the dough, or by carbonic acid gas generated within the\r\nmass, either before or during the baking, by a fermentative or chemical\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nWhen air is the agency used, the gluten, by its glue-like properties,\r\ncatches and retains the air for a short period; and if heat is applied\r\nbefore the air, which is lighter than the dough, rises and escapes, it\r\nwill expand, and in expanding distend the elastic glutinous mass,\r\ncausing it to puff up or rise. If the heat is sufficient to harden the\r\ngluten quickly, so that the air cells throughout the whole mass become\r\nfirmly fixed before the air escapes, the result will be a light, porous\r\nbread. If the heat is not sufficient, the air does not properly expand;\r\nor if before a sufficient crust is formed to retain the air and form a\r\nframework of support for the dough, the heat is lessened or withdrawn,\r\nthe air will escape, or contract to its former volume, allowing the\r\ndistended glutinous cell walls to collapse; in either case the bread\r\nwill be heavy.\r\n\r\nIf carbonic acid gas, generated within the dough by means of\r\nfermentation or by the use of chemical substances, be the means used to\r\nlighten the mass, the gluten by virtue of its tenacity holds the bubbles\r\nof gas as they are generated, and prevents the large and small ones from\r\nuniting, or from rising to the surface, as they seek to do, being\r\nlighter than the dough. Being thus caught where they are generated, and\r\nthe proper conditions supplied to expand them, they swell or raise the\r\ndough, which is then termed a loaf. (This word \"loaf\" is from the\r\nAnglo-Saxon _hlifian_, to raise or lift up.) The structure is rendered\r\npermanent by the application of heat in baking.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREAD MADE LIGHT BY FERMENTATION.\r\n\r\nFor general use, the most convenient form of bread is usually considered\r\nto be that made from wheat flour, raised or made light by some method of\r\nfermentation, although in point of nutritive value and healthfulness, it\r\ndoes not equal light, unfermented, or aërated bread made without the aid\r\nof chemicals.\r\n\r\nTHE PROCESS OF FERMENTATION.--Fermentation is a process of\r\ndecomposition, and hence more or less destructive to the substances\r\nsubjected to its influence. When animal and vegetable substances\r\ncontaining large amounts of nitrogenous elements are in a moist state\r\nand exposed to air, they very soon undergo a change, the result of which\r\nis decomposition or decay. This is occasioned by the action of germs,\r\nwhich feed upon nitrogenous substances, as do the various species of\r\nfungi. Meat, eggs, milk, and other foods rich in nitrogenous elements\r\ncan be preserved but a short time if exposed to the atmosphere. The\r\ncarbonaceous elements are different in this respect. When pure starch,\r\nsugar, or fat is exposed to the air in a moistened state, they exhibit\r\nthe very little tendency to change or decay. Yet if placed in contact\r\nwith decomposing substances containing nitrogen, they soon begin to\r\nchange, and are themselves decomposed and destroyed. This communication\r\nof the condition of change from one class of substances to another, is\r\ntermed fermentation. If a fermenting substance be added to a watery\r\nsolution containing sugar, the sugar will be changed or decomposed, and\r\ntwo new substances, alcohol and carbonic acid gas, are produced.\r\n\r\nThe different stages of fermentation are noted scientifically as\r\nalcoholic, acetous, and putrefactive. The first is the name given to the\r\nchange which takes place in the saccharine matter of the dough, which\r\nresults in the formation of alcohol and carbonic acid gas. This same\r\nchange takes place in the saccharine matter of fruits under the proper\r\nwith conditions of warmth, air, and moisture, and is utilized in the\r\nproduction of wines and fermented liquors.\r\n\r\nIn bread-making, the alcohol and carbonic acid gas produced during the\r\nfermentation, are formed from sugar,--that originally contained in the\r\nflour and the additional quantity formed from starch during the\r\nfermenting process. It is evident, therefore, that bread cannot be\r\nfermented without some loss in natural sweetness and nutritive value,\r\nand bread made after this method should be managed so as to deteriorate\r\nthe material as little as possible.\r\n\r\nIf this fermentation continues long enough, the acetous fermentation is\r\nset up, and _acetic_ acid, the essential element of vinegar, is formed\r\nand the dough becomes sour. If the process of fermentation is very much\r\nprolonged, the putrefactive change is set up, and the gluten is more or\r\nless decomposed.\r\n\r\nIf the dough be baked during the alcoholic and carbonic-acid stage of\r\nfermentation, the gas will render the loaf light and porous. The alcohol\r\nwill be dissipated by the heat during the baking, or evaporated shortly\r\nafterward, provided the baking be thorough. If the fermentation is\r\nallowed to proceed until the acetous fermentation has begun, the loaf,\r\nwhen baked, will be \"sad\" and heavy, since there is no longer any gas to\r\npuff it up. If, however, during the first or alcoholic stage of\r\nfermentation, new material be added, the same kind of fermentation will\r\ncontinue for a certain period longer.\r\n\r\nThese facts serve to show that great care and attention are necessary to\r\nproduce good bread by a fermentative process. If the fermentation has\r\nnot been allowed to proceed far enough to generate a sufficient amount\r\nof gas to permeate the whole mass, the result will be a heavy loaf; and\r\nif allowed to proceed too far, acid fermentation begins, the gas\r\nescapes, and we have sour as well as heavy bread. It is not enough,\r\nhowever, to prevent bread from reaching the acetous or sour stage of\r\nfermentation. Bread may be over-fermented when there is no appreciable\r\nsourness developed. Fermentation may be carried so far as to destroy\r\nmuch of the richness and sweetness of the loaf, and yet be arrested by\r\nthe baking process just before the acetous stage begins, so that it will\r\nbe light and porous, but decidedly lacking in flavor and substance.\r\nOver-fermentation also develops in the bread various bitter substances\r\nwhich obscure the natural sweetness of the bread and give to it an\r\nunpleasant flavor. Many of these substances are more or less harmful in\r\ncharacter, and include many poisons known as ptomaines, a class of\r\nchemical compounds produced by germs whenever fermentation or\r\ndecomposition of organic matter takes place. Much skill is required to\r\ndetermine at what point to arrest the fermentation, in order to save the\r\nsweetness and richness of the bread.\r\n\r\nFERMENTATIVE AGENTS.--Fermentation in vegetable matter is always\r\naccompanied by the growth of living organisms. The development of these\r\nminute organisms is the exciting cause of fermentation and putrefaction.\r\nThe germs or spores of some of these fermenting agents are always\r\npresent in the air. It is well known to housekeepers that if a batter of\r\nflour and water and a little salt be kept in a jar of water at a\r\ntemperature of from 100° to 110°, it will ferment in the course of five\r\nor six hours. Scientists assure us that this fermentation is occasioned\r\nby the introduction of the spores of certain species of fungi which are\r\ncontinually floating in the atmosphere, and the proper conditions of\r\nwarmth and moisture being supplied, they at once begin to grow and\r\nmultiply. This method of securing fermentation is utilized by housewives\r\nin making what is termed salt-rising bread. The raising of dough by this\r\nprocess is lengthy and uncertain, and a far more convenient method is to\r\naccelerate the fermentation by the addition of some active ferment. The\r\nancient method of accomplishing this was by adding to the dough a\r\nleaven, a portion of old dough which had been kept until it had begun to\r\nferment; but since the investigations of modern chemistry have made\r\nclear the properties of yeast, that has come to be considered the best\r\nagent for setting up the process of alcoholic fermentation in bread. The\r\nuse of leaven is still practiced to somewhat in some European countries.\r\nThe bread produced with leaven, although light and spongy in texture,\r\nhas an unpleasant, sour taste, and is much less wholesome than that\r\nproduced with fresh yeast.\r\n\r\nYeast is a collection of living organisms or plants belonging to the\r\nfamily of fungi, which, like all other plants, require warmth, moisture,\r\nand food, in order to promote growth, and when properly supplied with\r\nthese, they begin to grow and multiply rapidly. Fermentation will not\r\ntake place at a temperature below 30°, it proceeds slowly at 45°, but\r\nfrom 70° to 90° it goes on rapidly. Fermentation may be arrested by the\r\nexhaustion of either the fermenting agent or the food supply, or by\r\nexposure to heat at the temperature of boiling water. This latter fact\r\nenables the housewife to arrest the process of fermentation, when the\r\nloaf has become sufficiently light, by baking it in a hot oven. Heat\r\ndestroys most of the yeast cells; a few, however, remain in the loaf\r\nunchanged, and it is for this reason that yeast bread is considered less\r\nwholesome for dyspeptics than light unleavened bread. It is apparent,\r\nthen, that the more thoroughly fermented bread is baked, the more\r\nwholesome it will be, from the more complete destruction of the yeast\r\ngerms which it contains.\r\n\r\nYEAST.--Next to good flour, the most important requisite in the\r\nmanufacture of fermented bread is good yeast. The best of flour used in\r\nconjunction with poor yeast will not produce good bread. The most\r\nconvenient and reliable kind of marketable yeast, when fresh, is the\r\ncompressed yeast. The dry though they are always ready for use, the\r\nquality of the bread they produce is generally inferior to that made\r\nwith either compressed yeast or good liquid yeast. If this sort of yeast\r\nmust be depended upon, the cakes known as \"Yeast Foam\" are the best of\r\nany with which we are acquainted.\r\n\r\nOf homemade yeasts there are almost as many varieties as there are\r\ncooks. Their comparative value depends mainly upon the length of time\r\nthey will keep good, or the facility with which they can be prepared.\r\nEssentially the same principles are involved in the making of them all;\r\nviz., the introduction of a small quantity of fresh, lively yeast into a\r\nmixture of some form of starch (obtained from flour, potato, or a\r\ncombination of both) and water, with or without the addition of such\r\nother substances as will promote fermentation, or aid in preventing the\r\nyeast from souring. Under proper conditions of warmth, the small amount\r\nof original yeast begins to supply itself with food at once by\r\nconverting the starch into dextrine, and then into grape sugar, and\r\nmultiplies itself with great rapidity, and will continue to do so as\r\nlong as there is material to supply it with the means of growth. While\r\nits growth is rapid, its decay is equally so; and unless some means of\r\npreservation be employed, the yeast will die, and the mixture become\r\nsour and foul. Ordinarily it can be kept good for several days, and\r\nunder the best conditions, even three or four weeks. After it has been\r\nkept from four to six hours, it should be placed in some receptacle as\r\nnearly air-tight as possible and set in the cellar or refrigerator,\r\nwhere it can be kept at a temperature not conducive to fermentation.\r\nThus the little yeast organisms will remain in a quiescent state, but\r\nyet alive and capable of multiplying themselves when again surrounded\r\nwith favorable conditions.\r\n\r\nThe yeast should be kept in glass or glazed earthen ware. The vessel\r\ncontaining it should be washed and scalded with scrupulous care before\r\nnew yeast is put in, since the smallest particle of sour or spoiled\r\nyeast will ruin the fresh supply in a very short time. It is generally\r\nconceded that yeast will keep longer if the material of which it is made\r\nbe mixed with liquid of a boiling temperature, or cooked for a few\r\nminutes at boiling heat before adding the yeast. The reason for this\r\nundoubtedly lies in the fact that the boiling kills foreign germs, and\r\nthus prevents early souring or putrefaction. The yeast must not be\r\nadded, however, until the liquid has cooled to a little more than blood\r\nheat, as too great heat will kill the yeast cells.\r\n\r\nThe starch of the potato is thought to furnish better material for the\r\npromotion of yeast growth than that of wheat flour; but whether the\r\npotato be first cooked, mashed, and then combined with the other\r\ningredients, or grated raw and then cooked in boiling water, makes\r\nlittle difference so far as results are concerned, though the latter\r\nmethod may have the advantage of taking less time. If potatoes are used\r\nfor this purpose, they should be perfectly mature. New ones will not\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nSugar assists in promoting the growth of the yeast plant, and a small\r\namount is usually employed in making yeast. Hops serve to prevent the\r\nyeast from souring, and an infusion of them is frequently used for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nWhile it is essential that the water used should be boiling, it is also\r\nnecessary that the mixture should cooled to a lukewarm temperature\r\nbefore the introduction of the original yeast, as intense heat will kill\r\nthe yeast plant. Freezing cold will likewise produced the same result.\r\nWhile a cool temperature is one of the requisites for keeping yeast\r\nfresh, care must be taken, especially in winter, that it does not get\r\nchilled.\r\n\r\nWhen yeast is needed for bread, it is always the best plan to take a cup\r\nto the cellar or refrigerator for the desired quantity, and re-cover the\r\njar as quickly as possible. A half hour in a hot kitchen would be quite\r\nlikely to spoiled it. Always shake or stir the whole well before\r\nmeasuring out the yeast. In making yeast, used earthen bowls for mixing,\r\nporcelain-lined or granite-ware utensils for boiling, and silver or\r\nwooden spoons for stirring.\r\n\r\nBITTER YEAST.--It sometimes happens that an excessive use of hops\r\nin the making of yeast gives to it so bitter a flavor as to communicate\r\na disagreeable taste to the bread. To correct this bitterness, mix with\r\nthe yeast a considerable quantity of water, and let it stand for some\r\nhours, when the thickest portion will have settled at the bottom. The\r\nwater, which will have extracted much of the bitterness, can then be\r\nturned off and thrown away. Yeast also sometimes becomes a bitter from\r\nlong keeping. Freshly burnt charcoal thrown into the yeast is said to\r\nabsorb the odors and offensive matter and render the yeast more sweet;\r\nhowever, we do not recommend the use of any yeast so stale as to need\r\nsweetening or purifying. Yeast that is new and fresh is always best; old\r\nand stale yeast, even though it may still possess the property of\r\nraising the dough, will give an unpleasant taste to the bread, and is\r\nmuch less wholesome.\r\n\r\nTESTS FOR YEAST.--Liquid yeast, when good, is light in color and\r\nlooks foamy and effervescent; it has a pungent odor somewhat similar to\r\nweak ammonia, and if tasted will have a sharp, biting flavor. Yeast is\r\npoor when it looks dull and watery, and has a sour odor. Compressed\r\nyeast, if good, breaks off dry and looks white; if poor, it appears\r\nmoist and stringy.\r\n\r\nIf there is any question as to the quality of yeast, it is always best\r\nto test it before use by adding a little flour to a small quantity and\r\nsetting it in a warm place. If it begins to ferment in the course of\r\nfifteen or twenty minutes, it is good.\r\n\r\nSTARTING THE BREAD.--Having secured good yeast, it is necessary in\r\nsome way to diffuse it through the bread material so that it will set up\r\nan active fermentation, which, by the evolution of gas, will render the\r\nwhole mass light and porous. As fermentation is more sure, more rapid,\r\nand requires less yeast to start it when set in action in a thin mixture\r\nthan when introduced into stiff dough, the more common method of\r\nstarting fermented bread is by \"setting a sponge;\" viz., preparing a\r\nbatter of flour and liquid, to which potato is sometimes added, and into\r\nwhich the yeast is introduced. Some cooks, in making the batter, use\r\nthe whole amount of liquid needed for the bread, and as the sponge\r\nrises, add flour in small quantities, beating it back, and allowing it\r\nto rise a second, third, or even fourth time, until sufficient flour has\r\nbeen added to knead; others use only half the liquid in preparing the\r\nsponge, and when it has well risen, prepare a second one by adding the\r\nremainder of the liquid and fresh flour, in which case the fermented\r\nbatter acts as a double portion of yeast and raises the second sponge\r\nvery quickly. The requisite amount of flour is then added, the dough\r\nkneaded, and the whole allowed to rise a third time in the loaf. Other\r\ncooks dispense altogether with the sponge, adding to the liquid at first\r\nthe requisite amount of flour, kneading it thoroughly and allowing it to\r\nrise once in mass and again after molding into loaves. As to the\r\nsuperiority of one method over another, much depends upon their\r\nadaptability to the time and convenience of the user; light bread can be\r\nproduced by either method. Less yeast but more time will be required\r\nwhen the bread is started with a sponge. The end to be attained by all\r\nis a complete and equal diffusion of gas bubbles generated during\r\nfermentation throughout the whole mass of dough.\r\n\r\nThe preferable method of combining the materials needed for the batter\r\nis by first mingling the yeast with the water or milk. If condensed or\r\ndry yeast is used, previously dissolve it well in a half cupful or less\r\nof lukewarm water. Stir the flour slowly into the liquid mixture and\r\nbeat it _very thoroughly_ so that the yeast shall be evenly distributed\r\nthroughout the whole.\r\n\r\nPROPORTION OF MATERIALS NEEDED.--The material needed for making:\r\nthe bread should all be carefully measured out beforehand and the flour\r\nwell sifted. Many housekeepers fail in producing good bread, because\r\nthey guess at the quantity of material to be used, particularly the\r\nflour, and with the same quantity of liquid will one time use much more\r\nflour that at another, thus making the results exceedingly variable.\r\nWith this same brand of flour, this same quantity should always be used\r\nto produce a given amount of bread. This amount will depend upon the\r\nquality of the material used. Good flour will absorb a larger quantity\r\nof liquids than that of an inferior quality, and the amount of liquid a\r\ngiven quantity of flour will take up determines the quantity of bread\r\nthat can be produced from it. This amount is chiefly dependent upon the\r\nproportion of gluten contained in the flour. One hundred pounds of good\r\nflour will absorb sufficient water to produce one hundred and fifty\r\npounds of bread. One reason why bread retains so much water is that\r\nduring the baking a portion of starch is converted into gum, which holds\r\nwater more strongly than starch. Again: the gluten, when wet, is not\r\neasily dried, while the dry crust which forms around the bread in baking\r\nis merely impervious to water, and, like the skin of a baking potato,\r\nprevents the moisture from escaping.\r\n\r\nKinds of flour vary so considerably in respect to their absorbent\r\nproperties that it is not possible to state the exact proportions of\r\nflour and liquid required; approximately, three heaping measures of\r\nflour for one scant measure of liquid, including the yeast, will in\r\ngeneral be found a good proportion. Bread made from the entire wheat\r\nwill require from one half to one cupful less flour than that made of\r\nwhite flour. A quart of liquid, including the yeast, is sufficient for\r\nthree ordinary-sized loaves. One half or two thirds of a cup of homemade\r\nyeast, according to its strength, or one half a cake of compressed yeast\r\ndissolved in a half cup of lukewarm water, will be sufficient for one\r\nquart of liquid. It is a common mistake to use too much yeast. It\r\nlessens the time required, but the result is less satisfactory. Bread to\r\nbe set over night requires less yeast.\r\n\r\nWhether water or milk should be used for bread-making, depends upon\r\ntaste and convenience. Bread retains more nearly the natural flavor of\r\nthe grain if made with water, and is less apt to sour; at the same time,\r\nbread made with milk is more tender than that made with water. Bread\r\nmade with milk requires from one half to one cupful less of flour.\r\n\r\nPotatoes are sometimes used in conjunction with flour for bread-making.\r\nThey are by no means necessary when good flour is used, but bread made\r\nfrom inferior flour is improved by their use. Only potatoes that are\r\nfully matured should be used for this purpose, and they should be well\r\ncooked and smoothly mashed. Neither sugar nor salt is essential for the\r\nproduction of good bread, though most cook books recommend the use of\r\none or both. The proportion of the former should not exceed one even\r\ntablespoonful to three pints of flour, and the very smallest amount of\r\nsalt, never more than a half teaspoonful, and better less. No butter or\r\nother free fat is required; the tenderness of texture produced by its\r\nuse can be secured as well by the use of unskimmed milk and thorough\r\nkneading.\r\n\r\nUTENSILS.--For bread-making purposes, earthen or china ware is\r\npreferable to either tin or wooden utensils: being a poor conductor, it\r\nprotects the sponge from the cold air much more effectually than tin,\r\nand is much more easily kept clean and sweet than wood. The utensil\r\nshould be kept exclusively for the purpose of bread-making, and should\r\nnever be allowed to contain any sour substance. The bowl should be\r\nthoroughly scalded before and after each using. Use silver or\r\ngranite-ware spoons for stirring the bread. Iron and tin discolor the\r\nsponge. For measuring the material, particularly the liquid and the\r\nyeast, half-pint cups, divided by marks into thirds and fourths, as\r\nshown in the cut, are especially serviceable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Measuring Cup] [Illustration: Measuring Cup]\r\n\r\nWHEN TO SET THE SPONGE.--The time to set the sponge for\r\nbread-making is a point each housekeeper must determine for herself. The\r\nfact before stated, that temperature controls the activity of\r\nfermentation, and that it is retarded or accelerated according to the\r\nconditions of warmth, enables the housewife, by keeping the\r\nbread-mixture at a temperature of about 50° F., to set her bread in the\r\nevening, if desired, and find it light and ready for further attention\r\nin the morning. In winter, the sponge will need to be prepared early in\r\nthe evening and kept during the night at as even a temperature as\r\npossible. A good way to accomplish this is to cover the bowl with a\r\nclean napkin and afterwards wrap it about very closely with several\r\nfolds of a woolen blanket. In extremely cold weather bottles of hot\r\nwater may be placed around the bowl outside the wrappings. In case this\r\nplan is employed, care must be taken to have sufficient wrappings\r\nbetween the bread and the bottles to prevent undue heat, and the bottles\r\nshould be covered with an additional blanket to aid in retaining the\r\nheat as long as possible.\r\n\r\nIf the sponge is set in the evening, if in very warm weather, it should\r\nbe started as late as practicable, and left in a rather cool place.\r\nCover closely to exclude the air, but do not wrap in flannel as in\r\nwinter. It will be likely to need attention early in the morning.\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE FOR BREAD-MAKING.--Except in very warm weather, the\r\nferment or sponge should be started with liquid at a lukewarm\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nThe liquid should never be so cold as to chill the yeast. Milk, if used,\r\nshould be first sterilized by scalding, and then cooled before using.\r\n\r\nAfter the sponge is prepared, the greatest care must be taken to keep it\r\nat an equable temperature. From 70° to 90° is the best range of\r\ntemperature, 75° being considered the golden mean throughout the entire\r\nfermentative process of bread-making.\r\n\r\nAfter fermentation has well begun, it will continue, but much more\r\nslowly if the temperature be gradually lowered to 45° or 50°. If it is\r\nnecessary to hasten the rising, the temperature can be raised to 80° or\r\n85°, but it will necessitate careful watching, as it will be liable to\r\nover-ferment, and become sour. Cold arrests the process of fermentation,\r\nwhile too great heat carries forward the work too rapidly. Too much\r\nstress cannot be laid upon the importance of an equable temperature. The\r\nhousewife who permits the fermentation to proceed very slowly one hour,\r\nforces it rapidly by increased heat the next, and perhaps allows it to\r\nsubside to a chilling temperature the third, will never be sure of good\r\nbread.\r\n\r\nPutting the bowl containing the sponge into a dish of warm (not hot)\r\nwater, or keeping it in the warming oven, or on the back of the range,\r\nare all methods which may bring about good results, provided the same\r\ndegree of heat can be maintained continuously; but if the fire is one\r\nwhich must be increased or diminished to suit the exigencies of\r\nhousehold details, nothing but the closest and most careful attention\r\nwill keep the sponge at uniform temperature. The better way is to cover\r\nthe bowl with a napkin, and in cold weather wrap closely in several\r\nthicknesses of flannel, and place on a stand behind the stove, or in\r\nsome place not exposed to draughts. A bread-raiser purposely arranged\r\nfor keeping the bread at proper temperature is a great convenience. Two\r\nsmall and rather thick earthen ware crocks of the same size, serve very\r\nwell for this purpose. Scald both with hot water, and while still warm,\r\nput the sponge in one, invert the other for a cover, and leave in a warm\r\nroom. All flour used in the bread should be warm when added.\r\n\r\nLIGHTNESS OF THE BREAD.--The time required for bread in its\r\ndifferent stages to grow light will vary according to the quantity and\r\nstrength of the yeast used and the amount of warmth supplied. A thin\r\nbatter is light enough when in appearance it resembles throughout a mass\r\nof sea foam. It will not greatly increase in bulk, but will be in the\r\nstate of constant activity, sending up little bubbles of gas and\r\nemitting a sharp, pungent odor like fresh yeast.\r\n\r\nWhen the thicker batter or second sponge is sufficiently light, it will\r\nhave risen to nearly double its original bulk and become cracked over\r\nthe top like \"crazed\" china. It should never be allowed to rise to the\r\npoint of sinking or caving in, and should be kneaded as soon as ready.\r\nIf for any reason it is not possible to knead the bread at once when it\r\nhas arrived at this stage, do not allow it to stand, but take a knife or\r\nspoon and gently beat it back a little. This dissipates some of the gas\r\nand reduces the volume somewhat. Let it rise again, which it will do in\r\na short time, if it has not been allowed to become too light. If dough\r\nthat has been kneaded and allowed to rise in mass, becomes sufficiently\r\nlight at some inopportune moment for shaping into loaves, it may be kept\r\nfrom becoming too light and souring, by taking a knife and cutting it\r\naway from the sides of the bowl and gradually working it over toward the\r\ncenter. Re-cover and put in a warm place. It will soon assume its former\r\nbulk. This \"cutting down\" may be repeated several times if necessary,\r\nprovided the bread has not been allowed to become too light at any time,\r\nand some cook's recommend it as a uniform practice. We do not, however,\r\nexcept in case of necessity; since, though it may possibly make the\r\nbread more light, the long-continued fermentation destroys more than is\r\nnecessary of the food elements of the flour, and develops an unnecessary\r\namount of the products of fermentation. Lightness is not the only\r\nrequisite for bread, and should be secured with as little deterioration\r\nof the flour as possible.\r\n\r\nAn important point in the preparation of bread is to decide when it is\r\nsufficiently light after having been molded and placed in pans. The\r\nlength of time cannot be given, because it will vary with the\r\ntemperature, the quality of the flour, and the quantity added during the\r\nkneading. At a temperature of 75°, an hour or an hour and a half is\r\nabout the average length of time needed. A loaf should nearly double its\r\nsize after being placed in a pan, before baking; when perfectly risen,\r\nthe bread feels light when lifted and weighed upon the hand. It is\r\nbetter to begin the baking before it has perfectly risen them to wait\r\nuntil it has become so light as to commence to fall, since if the\r\nfermentation proceeds too far, the sweetness of the grain will be\r\ndestroyed, and the bread will be tasteless and innutritious, even if it\r\ndoes not reach the acetous stage.\r\n\r\nThe exercise of a little judgment and careful attention to detail will\r\nsoon enable a person successfully to determine the proper degree of\r\nlightness of bread in its various stages. Bread which passes the extreme\r\npoint of fermentation, or in common phrase gets \"too light,\" will have a\r\nstrong acid odor, and will pull away from the bowl in a stringy mass,\r\nhaving a watery appearance very different from the fine, spongy texture\r\nof properly risen dough. The acidity of such dough may be neutralized by\r\nthe addition of an alkali, and housewives who through carelessness and\r\ninattention have allowed their bread to become \"sour,\" often resort to\r\nsaleratus or soda to neutralize the acid. The result of such treatment\r\nis unwholesome bread, wholly unfit for food. It is better economy to\r\nthrow away bread material which needs to be sweetened with soda than to\r\nrun the risk of injury to health by using it.\r\n\r\nKNEADING THE DOUGH.--As fresh flour is added during the\r\nbread-making, it is necessary to mix it in thoroughly. As long as the\r\nbatter is thin, this can be done by thoroughly beating the mixture with\r\nthe addition of material; but when it is a thick dough, some other\r\nmethod must be adopted to bring about the desired result. The usual way\r\nis by mixing the dough to a proper consistency, and working it with the\r\nhands. This is termed _kneading_. Much of the excellence of bread\r\ndepends upon the thoroughness of this kneading, since if the yeast is\r\nnot intimately and equally mixed with every particle of flour, the bread\r\nwill not be uniform; some portions will be heavy and compact, while\r\nothers will be full of large, open cavities, from the excessive\r\nliberation of gas.\r\n\r\nThe length of time required for kneading depends upon the perfection\r\nwith which the yeast cells have been previously diffused throughout the\r\nsponge, and upon the quality of the flour used in preparing the bread,\r\nmuch less time being required for kneading dough made from good flour.\r\nSome consider an hour none too long to knead bread. Such a lengthy\r\nprocess may be advantageous, since one of the objects of kneading is to\r\nrender the glutinous parts of the flour so elastic that the dough may be\r\ncapable of expanding to several times its bulk without cracking or\r\nbreaking, but excellent results can be obtained from good flour with\r\nless labor. Bread has been kneaded all that is necessary when it will\r\nwork clean of the board, and when, after a smart blow with the fist in\r\nthe center of the mass, it will spring back to its original shape like\r\nan India rubber ball. Its elasticity is the surest test of its goodness;\r\nand when dough has been thus perfectly kneaded, it can be molded into\r\nany shape, rolled, twisted, or braided with ease. Chopping, cutting,\r\nstretching, and pulling--the dough are other methods for accomplishing\r\nthe same end.\r\n\r\nIf a large mass is to be kneaded, it is better to divide it into several\r\nportions and knead each separately. It is less laborious and more likely\r\nto result in an equal diffusion of the yeast. Bread is often spoiled by\r\nthe addition of too much flour during kneading. Dough should always be\r\nkneaded as soft as it can be handled, and only sufficient flour added to\r\nprevent its sticking to the board. Stiff bread is close in texture, and\r\nafter a day or two becomes dry and hard.\r\n\r\nHOW TO MANIPULATE THE DOUGH IN KNEADING.--Sprinkle the board well\r\nwith flour, and scrape the dough from the bowl with a knife. Dust the\r\nhands with flour, and then draw the dough with a rolling motion from the\r\nfarthest side toward you, using the finger tips for the purpose, but\r\npressing firmly down upon the mass with the palm of the hands. Reach\r\nforward again with the finger tips, and again press the ball of the\r\nhands upon the dough. Continue this process of manipulation until the\r\nmass is very much elongated; then turn at right angles and repeat the\r\nprocess, taking care that the finger tips do not break through the light\r\nfilm which will form upon the outside of soft dough when well managed.\r\n_Keep the dough constantly in motion_ until it is smooth, elastic, and\r\nfine-grained. The hands and the board may need a light dusting of flour\r\nat frequent intervals. If the dough sticks, lift it quickly, and clean\r\nthe board, that it may be kept smooth. The dough will not stick if kept\r\nin constant motion. Do not rub off little wads of dough either from the\r\nhands or the board and keep kneading them into the loaf; they will\r\nseriously injure the uniform texture of the bread.\r\n\r\nHOW MANY TIMES SHALL BREAD BE KNEADED?--As the objects to be\r\nattained in kneading dough are to render the gluten more elastic and\r\nthoroughly to diffuse the yeast, it will be seen that there has been\r\nsufficient kneading when all the flour necessary for the bread has been\r\nadded. Furthermore, it must be apparent that continued manipulation of\r\nthe dough at this stage will dissipate and press out the little vesicles\r\nof gas held in place by the elastic gluten, and thus lose in part what\r\nso much pains has been taken to secure. At whatever stage the requisite\r\namount of flour be added, the dough should then be thoroughly kneaded\r\nonce for all. If allowed to rise in bulk, when light it should be shaped\r\ninto loaves with the greatest care, handled lightly, and worked as\r\nlittle as possible, and if at all diminished, allowed to rise again\r\nbefore baking.\r\n\r\nDRYNESS OF THE SURFACE.--Bread in all stages should be covered over\r\nthe top, since it rises much more evenly, and does not have a stiff,\r\ndried surface, as when placed in a warm place exposed to air. It\r\nsometimes happens that this precaution is forgotten or not sufficiently\r\nattended to, and a dry crust forms and over the dough, which, if kneaded\r\ninto the loaves, leaves hard, dry spots in the bread. In case of such a\r\nmishap, take the dry crust off, dissolve it in a little warm water, add\r\nflour enough to mold, make it into a small loaf, and raise it\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nSIZE OF LOAVES.--The lightness of the bread after baking depends\r\nupon the perfection with which the little air-cells, formed during the\r\nfermenting process, have become fixed by the heat during the baking. The\r\nheat expands the carbonic acid gas contained within the open spaces in\r\nthe dough, and at the same time checks further development of gas by\r\ndestroying the yeast plant. The sooner, then, that the cells can be made\r\npermanent after the arrest of fermentation, the more light and porous\r\nthe bread will be. Although this fixing of the cells is largely\r\ndependent upon the degree of heat maintained, it likewise in a measure\r\ndepends upon the size of the loaf, as the heat will penetrate and fix\r\nthe cells of a small loaf throughout much sooner than, those of a large\r\none. Therefore, bake in small loaves, and have a separate pan for each,\r\nas that admits of an equal degree of heat to all sides. This aids in a\r\nmore rapid fixing of the air-cells and likewise gives more crust, which\r\nis the sweetest and most digestible part of the bread.\r\n\r\nSheet-iron pans, about eight inches in length, four in width, and five\r\nin depth, are the most satisfactory. After the dough is molded, divide\r\nit into loaves which will fill such pans to the depth of two inches. Let\r\nthem rise until double their first volume, and then put them in the\r\noven. In baking, the loaves will rise still higher, and if about five\r\ninches high when done, will have expanded to about the right\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bread Pan]\r\n\r\nPROPER TEMPERATURE OF THE OVEN.--The objects to be attained in the\r\nbaking of bread are to break up the starch and gluten cells of the Sour\r\nso as to make them easily digestible, to destroy the yeast plant, and\r\nrender permanent the cells formed by the action of the carbonic acid\r\ngas. To accomplish well these ends, the loaf must be surrounded by a\r\ntemperature ranging from 400° to 600°. The oven should be one in which\r\nthe heat is equal in all parts, and which can be kept at a steady,\r\nuniform heat. Old-fashioned brick ovens were superior in this respect to\r\nmost modern ranges. The fire for baking bread should be of sufficient\r\nstrength to keep the oven heated for at least an hour. If the oven has\r\ntendency to become too hot upon the bottom, a thin, open grate, broiler,\r\nor toasting rack, should be placed underneath the tins to allow a\r\ncirculation of air and avoid danger of burning. If the heat be\r\ninsufficient, fermentation will not cease until the bread has become\r\nsour; the cells will be imperfectly fixed or entirely collapsed; too\r\nlittle of the moisture will have evaporated, and the result will be a\r\nsoft, wet, and pasty or sour loaf. If the heat be too great, the bread\r\nwill be baked before it has perfectly risen, or a thick, burned crust\r\nwill be produced, forming a non-conducting covering to the loaf, which\r\nwill prevent the heat from permeating the interior, and thus the loaf\r\nwill have an overdone exterior, but will be raw and doughy within. If,\r\nhowever, the temperature of the oven be just right, the loaf will\r\ncontinue for a little time to enlarge, owing to the expansion of the\r\ncarbonic acid gas, the conversion of the water into steam, and the\r\nvaporizing of the alcohol, which rises in a gaseous form and is driven\r\noff by the heat; a nicely browned crust will be formed over the surface,\r\nthe result of the rapid evaporation of water from the surface and\r\nconsequent consolidation of the dough of this portion of the loaf, and a\r\nchemical change caused by the action of the heat upon the starch by\r\nwhich is converted into dextrine, finally assuming a brown color due to\r\nthe production of a substance known to the chemist as _assama_.\r\n\r\nBread is often spoiled in the baking. The dough may be made of the best\r\nof flour and yeast, mixed and kneaded in the most perfect manner, and\r\nmay have risen to the proper degree of lightness' before going to the\r\noven, yet if the oven is either too hot or not hot enough, the bread\r\nwill be of an inferior quality.\r\n\r\nWithout an oven thermometer, there is no accurate means of determining\r\nthe temperature of the oven; but housekeepers resort to various means to\r\nform a judgment about it. The baker's old-fashioned method is to throw a\r\nhandful of flour on the oven bottom. If it blackens without igniting,\r\nthe heat is deemed sufficient. Since the object for which the heat is\r\ndesired is to cook the flour, not to burn it, it might be supposed that\r\nthis would indicate too high a temperature; but the flour within the\r\nloaf to be baked is combined with a certain amount of moisture, the\r\nevaporation of which lowers the temperature of the bread considerably\r\nbelow that of the surrounding heated atmosphere. The temperature of the\r\ninner portion of the loaf cannot exceed 212° so long as it continues\r\nmoist. Bread might be perfectly cooked at this temperature by steam, but\r\nit would lack that most digestible portion of the loaf, the crust.\r\n\r\nA common way of ascertaining if the heat of the oven is sufficient, is\r\nto hold the bare arm inside it for a few seconds. If the arm cannot be\r\nheld within while thirty is counted, it is too hot to begin with. The\r\nfollowing test is more accurate: For rolls, the oven should be hot\r\nenough to brown a teaspoonful of flour in _one_ minute, and for loaves\r\nin _five_ minutes.\r\n\r\nThe temperature should be high enough to arrest the fermentation, which\r\nit will do at a point considerably below the boiling point of water, and\r\nat the same time to form a shell or crust, which will so support the\r\ndough as to prevent it from sinking or collapsing when the evolution of\r\ncarbonic acid gas shall cease; but it should not be hot enough to brown\r\nthe crust within ten or fifteen minutes. The heat should increase for\r\nthe first fifteen minutes, remain steady for the next fifteen minutes,\r\nand may then gradually decrease during the remainder of the baking. If\r\nby any mischance the oven be so hot as to brown the crust too soon,\r\ncover the loaf with a clean paper for a few minutes. Be careful that no\r\ndraught reaches the bread while baking; open the oven door very seldom,\r\nand not at all for the first ten minutes. If it is necessary to turn the\r\nloaf, try to do so without bringing it to the air. From three fourths of\r\nan hour to an hour is usually a sufficient length of time to bake an\r\nordinary sized loaf. Be careful not to remove the bread from the oven\r\nuntil perfectly done. It is better to allow it to bake ten minutes too\r\nlong than not long enough. The crust of bread, when done, should be\r\nequally browned all over.\r\n\r\nThe common test for well-baked bread is to tap it on the bottom with the\r\nfinger; if it is light and well done, it will sound hollow; heavy bread\r\nwill have a dull sound. A thoroughly baked loaf will not burn the hand\r\nwhen lifted upon it from the pan.\r\n\r\nCARE OF BREAD AFTER BAKING.--When done, remove the loaves from the\r\ntins, and tilt them upon edge so that the air may circulate freely on\r\nall sides of them to prevent \"sweating.\" Do not, however, lay them on a\r\npine shelf or table to absorb the odor of the wood. A large tin dripping\r\npan turned over upon the table does very well to tilt them on. If they\r\nare turned often, so that they will not soften on one side, but a fine\r\nwire bread cooler is the best thing. If this is not obtainable, a fair\r\nsubstitute can be easily improvised by tacking window-screen wire to a\r\nlight frame of sufficient size to hold the requisite number of loaves.\r\nIf the bread is left exposed to the air until cold, the crust will be\r\ncrisp; if a soft crust is desired, it can be secured by brushing the top\r\nof the loaf while hot, with tepid water, and covering with several\r\nthicknesses of a clean bread cloth.\r\n\r\nIf by accident any portion of the crust is burnt, grate it away as soon\r\nas cold; this is preferable to cutting or clipping it off.\r\n\r\nBEST METHOD OF KEEPING BREAD.--When the bread is quite cold, put it\r\naway in a bread box, which should be of tin, or of wood lined with tin,\r\nconvenient in form and supplied with a well-fitting cover. Never use an\r\nunlined wooden box of any kind, as it cannot easily be kept fresh and\r\nfree from musty odors, which bread so readily absorbs.\r\n\r\nStone and earthen ware are not open to this objection, but they are\r\nlikely to collect moisture, and hence are not equal to a tin receptacle.\r\nDo not keep bread in the cellar or any other damp place, nor in a close\r\ncloset, where there are other foods from which it can absorb odors. The\r\nbread box should be kept well covered, and free from crumbs and stale\r\nbits. It should be carefully washed in boiling soapsuds, scalded, and\r\ndried, every two or three days. If cloths are used to wrap or cover the\r\nbread, they too should be washed and scalded every week, and oftener if\r\nat any time the loaf about which they are wrapped becomes moldy or\r\nmusty.\r\n\r\nTEST OF GOOD FERMENTED BREAD.--A loaf of good bread, well risen and\r\nperfectly baked, may be taken in the hands, and, with the thumb on the\r\ntop crust and fingers upon the bottom of the loaf, pressed to less than\r\nhalf its thickness, and when the pressure is removed, it will\r\nimmediately expand like a sponge, to its former proportions.\r\n\r\nGood yeast bread, while it should be firm and preserve a certain amount\r\nof moisture, will, when cold, crumble easily when rubbed between the\r\nfingers. If, instead, it forms a close, soggy mass, it may be regarded\r\nas indigestible. This is one reason why hot, new yeast bread and biscuit\r\nare so indigestible. In demonstration of this, take a small lump of new\r\nbread, gently roll it into a ball, and put into a glass of water, adding\r\na similar quantity of stale bread of the same kind also. The latter will\r\ncrumble away very soon, while the former will retain its form for hours,\r\nreminding one of its condition in the stomach, \"as hard as a bullet,\"\r\nfor a long time resisting the action of the gastric juice, although,\r\nmeanwhile, the yeast germs which have not been killed in the oven are\r\nconverting the mass into a lump of yeast, by which the whole contents of\r\nthe stomach are soured. A soluble article like salt or sugar in fine\r\npowdered form is much more easily and quickly dissolved than the same\r\narticle in solid lumps, and so it is with food. The apparent dryness of\r\nstale bread is not caused by its loss of moisture; for if carefully\r\nweighed, stale bread will be found to contain almost exactly the same\r\nproportion of water as new bread that has become cold. The moisture has\r\nonly passed into a state of concealment, as may be demonstrated by\r\nsubjecting a stale loaf inclosed in a tightly-sealed receptacle to a\r\ntemperature equal to boiling heat in an oven for half an hour, when it\r\nwill again have the appearance of new bread.\r\n\r\nHot bread eaten with butter is still more unwholesome, for the reason\r\nthat the melted grease fills up the pores of the bread, and further\r\ninterferes with the action of the digestive fluids.\r\n\r\nWHOLE-WHEAT AND GRAHAM BREADS.--The same general principles are\r\ninvolved in the making of bread with whole-wheat and Graham flours as in\r\nthe production of bread from white flour. Good material and good care\r\nare absolutely essential.\r\n\r\nWhole-wheat flour ferments more readily and rises more quickly than does\r\nwhite flour, hence bread made with it needs more careful management, as\r\nit is more liable to sour. The novice in bread-making should not\r\nundertake the preparation of bread with whole-wheat flour, until she has\r\nthoroughly mastered all the details of the art by practical experience,\r\nand can produce a perfect loaf from white flour.\r\n\r\nBreads from whole-wheat and Graham flours require less yeast and less\r\nflour than bread prepared from white flour. A slower process of\r\nfermentation is also advantageous.\r\n\r\nSuch breads will be lighter if at least one third white flour be\r\nemployed in their manufacture. When the bread is made with a sponge,\r\nthis white flour may be utilised for the purpose. Thus the length of\r\ntime the whole-wheat flour will be undergoing fermentation will be\r\nsomewhat lessened, and its liability to become sour diminished. This\r\nplan is a preferable one for beginners in bread-making.\r\n\r\nGraham and whole-wheat flour breads must be kneaded longer than\r\nwhite-flour bread, and require a hotter oven at first and a longer time\r\nfor baking. Much Graham and whole-wheat bread is served insufficiently\r\nbaked, probably owing to the fact that, being dark in color, the crust\r\nappears brown very soon, thus deluding the cook into supposing that the\r\nloaf is well baked. For thorough baking, from one to one and a half\r\nhours are needed, according to the size of the loaf and the heat of the\r\noven.\r\n\r\nTOAST.--Toasting, if properly done, renders bread more digestible,\r\nthe starch being converted into dextrine by the toasting process; but by\r\nthe ordinary method of preparing toast, that of simply browning each\r\nside, only the surfaces of the slices are really toasted, while the\r\naction of the heat upon the interior of the slice, it is rendered\r\nexactly in the condition of new bread, and consequently quite as\r\nindigestible. If butter is added while the toast is hot, we have all the\r\ndyspepsia-producing elements of new bread and butter combined. Although\r\nconsidered to be the dish _par excellence_ for invalids, nothing could\r\nbe more unwholesome than such toast. To properly toast the bread, the\r\ndrying and browning should extend throughout the entire thickness of the\r\nslice. Bread may be thus toasted before an open fire, but the process\r\nwould be such a lengthy and troublesome one, it is far better to secure\r\nthe same results by browning the bread in a moderate oven.\r\n\r\nSuch toast is sometimes called _zwieback_ (twice baked), and when\r\nprepared from good whole-wheat bread, is one of the most nourishing and\r\ndigestible of foods. Directions for its preparation and use will be\r\nfound in the chapter on \"Breakfast Dishes.\"\r\n\r\nSTEAMED BREAD.--Steaming stale bread is as open to objection as the\r\nsurface toasting of bread, if steamed so as to be yielding and adhesive.\r\nIt is not, perhaps, as unwholesome as new bread, but bread is best eaten\r\nin a condition dry and hard enough to require chewing, that its starch\r\nmay be so changed by the action of the saliva as to be easily digested.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIQUID YEAST.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nRAW POTATO YEAST.--Mix one fourth of a cup of flour, the same of\r\nwhite sugar, and a teaspoonful of salt to a paste with a little water.\r\nPare three medium-size, fresh, and sound potatoes, and grate them as\r\nrapidly as possible into the paste; mix all quickly together with a\r\nsilver spoon, then pour three pints of boiling water slowly over the\r\nmixture, stirring well at the same time. If this does not rupture the\r\nstarch cells of the flour and potatoes so that the mixture becomes\r\nthickened to the consistency of starch, turn it into a granite-ware\r\nkettle and boil up for a minute, stirring well to keep it from sticking\r\nand burning. If it becomes too much thickened, add a little more boiling\r\nwater. It is impossible to give the exact amount of water, since the\r\nquality of the flour will vary, and likewise the size of the potatoes;\r\nbut three pints is an approximate proportion. Strain the mixture through\r\na fine colander into an earthen bread bowl, and let it cool. When\r\nlukewarm, add one cup of good, lively yeast. Cover with a napkin, and\r\nkeep in a moderately warm place for several hours, or until it ceases to\r\nferment. As it begins to ferment, stir it well occasionally, and when\r\nwell fermented, turn into a clean glass or earthen jar. The next morning\r\ncover closely, and put in the cellar or refrigerator, not, however, in\r\ncontact with the ice. It is best to reserve enough for the first baking\r\nin some smaller jar, so that the larger portion need not be opened so\r\nsoon. Always shake the yeast before using.\r\n\r\nRAW POTATO YEAST NO. 2.--This is made in the same manner as the\r\npreceding, with this exception, that one fourth of a cup of loose hops\r\ntied in a clean muslin bag, is boiled in the water for five minutes\r\nbefore pouring it into the potato and flour mixture. Many think the\r\naddition of the hops aids in keeping the yeast sweet for a longer\r\nperiod. But potato yeast may be kept sweet for two weeks without hops,\r\nif cared for, and is preferred by those who dislike the peculiar flavor\r\nof the bread made from hop yeast.\r\n\r\nHOP YEAST.--Put half a cup of loose hops, or an eighth of an ounce\r\nof the pressed hops (put up by the Shakers and sold by druggists), into\r\na granite-ware kettle; pour over it a quart of boiling water, and simmer\r\nabout five minutes. Meanwhile stir to a smooth paste in a tin basin or\r\nanother saucepan, a cup of flour, and a little cold water. Line a\r\ncolander with a thin cloth, and strain the boiling infusion of hops\r\nthrough it onto the flour paste, stirring continually. Boil this thin\r\nstarch a few minutes, until it thickens, stirring constantly that no\r\nlumps be formed. Turn it into a large earthen bowl, add a tablespoonful\r\nof salt and two of white sugar, and when it has cooled to blood heat,\r\nadd one half cup of lively yeast, stirring all well together. Cover the\r\nbowl with a napkin, and let it stand in some moderately warm place\r\ntwenty-four hours, or until it ceases to ferment or send up bubbles,\r\nbeating back occasionally as it rises; then put into a wide-mouthed\r\nglass or earthen jar, which has been previously scalded and dried, cover\r\nclosely, and set in a cool place. Yeast made in this manner will keep\r\nsweet for two weeks in summer and longer in winter.\r\n\r\nBOILED POTATO YEAST.--Peel four large potatoes, and put them to\r\nboil in two quarts of cold water. Tie two loose handfuls of hops\r\nsecurely in a piece of muslin, and place in the water to boil with the\r\npotatoes. When the potatoes are tender, remove them with a perforated\r\nskimmer, leaving the water still boiling. Mash them, and work in four\r\ntablespoons of flour and two of sugar. Over this mixture pour gradually\r\nthe boiling hop infusion, stirring constantly, that it may form a smooth\r\npaste, and set it aside to cool. When lukewarm, add a gill of lively\r\nyeast, and proceed as in the preceding recipe.\r\n\r\nBOILED POTATO YEAST NO. 2.--To one teacupful of very smoothly\r\nmashed, mealy potato, add three teaspoonfuls of white sugar, one\r\nteaspoonful of salt, and one cup of lively yeast, or one cake of Yeast\r\nFoam, dissolved in a very little water. The potatoes should be warm, but\r\nnot hot enough to destroy the yeast. Allow this to stand until light,\r\nwhen it is ready for use.\r\n\r\n\r\nFERMENTED BREADS.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of breads after the following recipes, the measure of\r\nflour should be heaping.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nMILK BREAD WITH WHITE FLOUR.--Scald and cool on pint of unskimmed\r\nmilk. Add to the milk when lukewarm, one fourth of a cup, or three\r\ntablespoonfuls, of liquid yeast, and three cups of flour. Give the\r\nbatter a vigorous beating, turn it into a clean bread bowl or a small\r\nearthen crock, cover, and let it rise over night. In the morning, when\r\nwell risen, add two or three cupfuls of warm flour, or sufficient to\r\nknead. Knead well until the dough is sufficiently elastic to rebound\r\nwhen struck forcibly with the fist. Allow it to rise again in mass; then\r\nshape into loaves; place in pans; let it stand until light, and bake. If\r\nundesirable to set the bread over night, and additional tablespoonfuls\r\nor two of cheese may be used, to facilitate the rising.\r\n\r\nVIENNA BREAD.--Into a pint of milk sterilized by scalding, turn a\r\ncup and a half of boiling water. When lukewarm, add one half cup of warm\r\nwater, in which has been dissolved a cake of compressed yeast, and a\r\nquart of white flour. Beat the batter thus made very thoroughly, and\r\nallow it to rise for one hour; then add white flour until the dough is\r\nof a consistency to knead. Knead well, and allow it to rise again for\r\nabout three hours, or until very light. Shape into four loaves, handling\r\nlightly. Let it rise again in the pans, and bake. During the baking,\r\nwash the tops of the loaves with a sponge dipped in milk, to glaze them.\r\n\r\nWATER BREAD.--Dissolve a tablespoonful of sugar in a pint of\r\nboiling water. When lukewarm, add one fourth of a cup full of liquid\r\nyeast, and sufficient flour to make a batter thick enough to drop from\r\nthe spoon. Beat vigorously for ten minutes, turn into a clean,\r\nwell-scalded bread bowl, cover (wrapping in a blanket if in cold\r\nweather), and let it rise over night. In the morning, when well risen,\r\nadd flour to knead. Knead well for half an hour, cover, and let it\r\nbecome light in mass. When light, shape into loaves, allow it to rise\r\nagain, and bake.\r\n\r\nFRUIT ROLL.--Take some bread dough prepared as for Milk Bread,\r\nwhich has been sufficiently kneaded and is ready to mold, and roll to\r\nabout one inch in thickness. Spread over it some dates which have been\r\nwashed, dried, and stoned, raisins, currants, or chopped figs. Roll it\r\nup tightly into a loaf. Let and it rise until very light, and bake.\r\n\r\nFRUIT LOAF.--Set a sponge with one pint of rich milk, one fourth\r\ncup of yeast, and a pint of flour, over night. In the morning, add two\r\ncups of Zante currents, one cup of sugar, and three cups of flour, or\r\nenough to make a rather stiff dough. Knead well, and set to rise; when\r\nlight, mold into loaves; let it rise again, and bake.\r\n\r\nPOTATO BREAD.--Cook and mash perfectly smooth, potatoes to make a\r\ncupful. Add a teaspoonful of best white sugar, one cup and a half of\r\nwarm water, and when the mixture is lukewarm, one half cup of yeast,\r\nprepared as directed for Boiled Potato Yeast No. 2, and flour to make a\r\nvery thick batter. Allow it to rise over night. In the morning, add a\r\npint of warm water and flour enough to knead. The dough will need to be\r\nconsiderably stiffer than when no potato is used, or the result will be\r\na bread too moist for easy digestion. Knead well. Let it rise, mold into\r\nfour loaves, and when again light, bake.\r\n\r\nPULLED BREAD.--Remove a loaf from the oven when about half baked,\r\nand lightly pull the partially set dough into pieces of irregular shape,\r\nabout half the size of one's fist. Do not smooth or mold the pieces;\r\nbake in a slow oven until browned and crisp throughout.\r\n\r\nWHOLE WHEAT BREAD.--The materials needed for the bread are: one\r\npint of milk, scalded and cooled, one quart of wheat berry flour, one\r\npint Minnesota spring wheat flour, one third cup of a soft yeast, or one\r\nfourth cake of compressed yeast, dissolved in one third cup of cold\r\nwater. Stir enough flour into the milk to make a stiff batter, put in\r\nthe yeast, and let it rise until foamy. Have the milk so warm that, when\r\nthe flour is put in, the batter will be of a lukewarm temperature. Wrap\r\nin a thick blanket, and keep at an equable temperature. When light, stir\r\nin, slowly, warm flour to make a soft dough. Knead for fifteen minutes,\r\nand return to the bowl (which has been washed and oiled) to rise again.\r\nWhen risen to double its size, form into two loaves, place in separate\r\npans, let rise again, and bake from three fourths to one and one half\r\nhours, according to the heat of the oven.\r\n\r\nWHOLE-WHEAT BREAD NO. 2.--Scald one pint of unskimmed milk; when\r\nlukewarm, add one half cup of liquid yeast, or one fourth cake of\r\ncompressed yeast, dissolved in one half cup of warm water, and a pint of\r\nPillsbury's best white flour. Beat this batter thoroughly, and allow it\r\nto rise. When well risen, add three and two thirds cups of wheat berry\r\nflour. Knead thoroughly, and allow it to become light in mass; then\r\nshape into two loaves, allow it to rise again, and bake.\r\n\r\nMISS. B'S ONE-RISING BREAD.--Sift and measure three and three\r\nfourths cups of wheat berry flour. Scald and cool a pint of unskimmed\r\nmilk. When lukewarm, add one tablespoonful of lively liquid yeast. By\r\nslow degrees add the flour, beating vigorously until too stiff to use a\r\nspoon, then knead thoroughly for half an hour, shape into a loaf, place\r\nin a bread pan, cover with a napkin in warm weather, wrap well with\r\nblankets in cold weather, and let rise over night. In the morning, when\r\nperfectly light, pat in a well heated oven, and bake.\r\n\r\nPOTATO BREAD WITH WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR.--Take a half gill of liquid\r\nyeast made as for Boiled Potato Yeast No. 2, and add milk, sterilised\r\nand cooled to lukewarm, to make a pint. And one cup of well-mashed,\r\nmealy potato and one cup of white flour, or enough to make a rather\r\nthick batter Beat thoroughly, cover, and set to rise. When well risen,\r\nadd sufficient whole-wheat flour to knead. The quantity will vary\r\nsomewhat with the brand of flour used, but about four and one fourth\r\ncupfuls will in general be needed. Knead well, let it rise in mass and\r\nagain in the loaf, and bake.\r\n\r\nRYE BREAD.--Prepare a sponge over night with white flour as for\r\nWater Bread. In the morning, when light, add another tablespoonful of\r\nsugar, and rye flour to knead. Proceed as directed for the Water Bread,\r\ntaking care to use only enough rye flour to make the dough Just stiff\r\nenough to mold. Use white flour for dusting than kneading board, as the\r\nrye flour is sticky.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM BREAD.--Take two tablespoonfuls of lively liquid yeast, or a\r\nlittle less than one fourth cake of compressed yeast, dissolved in a\r\nlittle milk, and add new milk, scalded and cooled to lukewarm, to make\r\none pint. Add one pint of white flour, beat very thoroughly, and set to\r\nrise. When very light, add three find one half cupfuls of sifted Graham\r\nflour, or enough to make a dough that can be molded. Knead well for half\r\nan hour. Place in a clean, slightly oiled bread bowl, cover, and allow\r\nit to rise. When light, shape into a loaf: allow it to rise again, and\r\nbake.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM BREAD NO. 2.--Mix well one pint of white and two pints of\r\nbest Graham flour. Prepare a batter with a scant pint of milk, scalded\r\nand cooled, two table spoonfuls of liquid yeast, or a little less than\r\none fourth of a cake of compressed yeast, dissolved in two table\r\nspoonfuls of milk, and a portion of the mixed flour. Give it a vigorous\r\nbeating, and put it in a warm place to rise. When well risen, add more\r\nflour to make a dough sufficiently stiff to knead. There will be some\r\nvariation in the amount required, dependent upon the brands of flour\r\nused, but in general, two and one half pints of the flour will be enough\r\nfor preparing the sponge and kneading the dough. Knead thoroughly for\r\ntwenty-five or thirty minutes. Put into a clean and slightly oiled bread\r\nbowl, cover, and set to rise again. When double its first bulk, mold\r\ninto a loaf; allow it to rise again, and bake.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM BREAD NO. 3.--Mix three pounds each of Graham and Minnesota\r\nspring wheat flour. Make a sponge of one and a half pints of warm water,\r\none half cake compressed yeast, well dissolved in the water, and flour\r\nto form a batter. Let this rise. When well risen, add one and a half\r\npints more of warm water, one half cup full of New Orleans molasses, and\r\nsufficient flour to knead. Work the bread thoroughly, allow it to rise\r\nin mass; then mold, place in pans, and let it rise again. The amount of\r\nmaterial given is sufficient for four loaves of bread.\r\n\r\nRAISED BISCUIT.--These may be made from dough prepared by any of\r\nthe preceding recipes for bread. They will be more tender if made with\r\nmilk, and if the dough is prepared expressly for biscuits, one third\r\ncream may be used. When the dough has been thoroughly kneaded the last\r\ntime, divide into small, equal-sized pieces. A quantity of dough\r\nsufficient for one loaf of bread should be divided into twelve or\r\nsixteen such portions. Shape into smooth, round biscuits, fit closely\r\ninto a shallow pan, and let them rise until very light. Biscuit should\r\nbe allowed to become lighter than bread before putting in the oven,\r\nsince, being so much smaller, fermentation is arrested much sooner, and\r\nthey do not rise as much in the oven as does bread.\r\n\r\nROLLS.--Well kneaded and risen bread dough is made into a variety\r\nof small forms termed rolls, by rolling with the hands or with a\r\nrolling-pin, and afterward cutting or folding into any shape desired,\r\nthe particular manner by which they are folded and shaped giving to the\r\nrolls their characteristic names. Dough prepared with rich milk or part\r\ncream makes the best rolls. It may be divided into small, irregular\r\nportions, about one inch in thickness, and shaped by taking each piece\r\nseparately in the left hand, then with the thumb and first finger of the\r\nright hand, slightly stretch one of the points of the piece and draw it\r\nover the left thumb toward the center of the roll, holding it there with\r\nthe left thumb. Turn the dough and repeat the operation until you have\r\nbeen all around the dough, and each point has been drawn in; then place\r\non the pan to rise. Allow the rolls to become very light, and bake.\r\nRolls prepared in this manner are termed _Imperial Rolls_, and if the\r\nfolding has been properly done, when well baked they will be composed of\r\na succession of light layers, which can be readily separated.\r\n\r\n_French Rolls_ may be made by shaping each portion of dough into small\r\noval rolls quite tapering at each end, allowing them to become light,\r\nand baking far enough apart so that one will not touch another.\r\n\r\nIf, when the dough is light and ready to shape, it be rolled on the\r\nboard until about one eighth of an inch in thickness, and cut into\r\nfive-inch squares, then divided through the center into triangles,\r\nrolled up, beginning with the wide side, and placed in the pan to rise\r\nin semicircular shape, the rolls are called _Crescents_.\r\n\r\nWhat are termed _Parker House Rolls_ may be made from well-risen dough\r\nprepared with milk, rolled upon the board to a uniform thickness of\r\nabout one forth inch; cut into round or oval shapes with the cutter;\r\nfolded, one third over the other two thirds; allowed to rise until very\r\nlight, and baked.\r\n\r\nThe light, rolled dough, may be formed into a _Braid_ by cutting into\r\nstrips six inches in length and one in width, joining the ends of each\r\nthree, and braiding.\r\n\r\nThe heat of the oven should be somewhat greater for roils and biscuit\r\nthan for bread. The time required will depend upon the heat and the size\r\nof the roll, but it will seldom exceed one half hour. Neither rolls nor\r\nbiscuits should be eaten hot, as they are then open to the same\r\nobjections as other new yeast bread.\r\n\r\nBROWN BREAD.--To one and one fourth cups of new milk which has been\r\nscalded and cooled, add one fourth of a cup of lively yeast, three\r\ntablespoonfuls of sugar, and one cup each of white flour, rye flour or\r\nsifted rye meal, and yellow corn meal. With different brands of flour\r\nthere may need to be some variation in the quantity of liquid to be\r\nused. The mixture should be thick enough to shape. Allow it to rise\r\nuntil light and cracked over the top; put into a bread pan, and when\r\nagain well risen, bake for an hour and a half or two hours in an oven\r\nsufficiently hot at first to arrest fermentation and fix the bread\r\ncells, afterwards allowing the heat to diminish somewhat, to permit a\r\nslower and longer baking. Graham flour may be used in place of rye, if\r\npreferred.\r\n\r\nDATE BREAD.--Take a pint of light white bread sponge prepared with\r\nmilk, add two tablespoons of sugar, and Graham flour to make a very\r\nstiff batter. And last a cupful of stoned dates. Turn into a bread pan.\r\nLet it rise, and bake.\r\n\r\nFRUIT LOAF WITH GRAHAM AND WHOLE-WHEAT FLOUR.--Dissolve one fourth\r\ncake of compressed yeast in a pint of sterilized milk; and a pint of\r\nwhite flour; heat thoroughly, and set to rise. When well risen, add\r\nthree and one fourth cups of flour (Graham and whole-wheat, equal\r\nproportions, thoroughly mixed), or sufficient to knead. Knead well for\r\nhalf an hour, and just at the last add a cup of raisins, well washed,\r\ndried, and dusted with flour. Let the loaf rise in mass; then shape, put\r\nin the pan, allow it to become light again, and bake.\r\n\r\nRAISED CORN BREAD.--Into two cupfuls of hot mush made from white\r\ngranular corn meal, stir two cupfuls of cold water. Beat well, and add\r\none half cup of liquid yeast, or one half cake of compressed yeast,\r\ndissolved in one half cup of warm water, and two teaspoonfuls of\r\ngranulated sugar. Stir in white or sifted Graham flour to make it stiff\r\nenough to knead. Knead very thoroughly, and put in a warm place to rise.\r\nWhen light, molded into three loaves, put into pans, and allow it to\r\nrise again. When well risen, bake at least for three fourths of an hour.\r\n\r\nCORN CAKE.--Sterilise a cupful of rich milk or thin cream. Cool to\r\nlukewarm, and dissolve in it half a cake of compressed yeast Add two\r\nsmall cupfuls of white flour; beat very thoroughly, and put in a warm\r\nplace to rise. When light, add a cup of lukewarm water or milk, and two\r\ncups of best yellow cornmeal. Turn into a shallow square pan, and leave\r\nuntil again well risen. Bake in a quick oven. A tablespoonful of sugar\r\nmay be added with the corn meal, if desired.\r\n\r\nOATMEAL BREAD.--Mix a quart of well-cooked oatmeal mush with a pint\r\nof water, beating it perfectly smooth; add a cupful of liquid yeast and\r\nflour to make a stiff batter. Cover, and let it rise. When light, add\r\nsufficient flour to mold; knead as soft as possible, for twenty or\r\nthirty minutes; shape into four or more loaves, let it rise again, and\r\nbake.\r\n\r\nMILK YEAST BREAD.--Prepare the yeast the day before by scalding\r\nthree heaping teaspoonfuls of fresh cornmeal with boiling milk. Set in a\r\nwarm place until light (from seven to ten hours); then put in a cool\r\nplace until needed for use. Start the bread by making a rather thick\r\nbatter with one cupful of warm water, one teaspoonful of the prepared\r\nyeast, and white flour. Put in a warm place to rise. When light, add to\r\nit a cupful of flour scalded with a cupful of boiling milk, and enough\r\nmore flour to make the whole into a rather stiff batter. Cover, and\r\nallow it to rise. When again well risen, add flour enough to knead.\r\nKnead well; shape into a loaf; let it rise, and bake. Three or four\r\ncupfuls of white flour will be needed for all purposes with the amount\r\nof liquid given; more liquid and flour may be added in forming the\r\nsecond sponge if a larger quantity of bread is desired. In preparing\r\nboth yeast and bread, all utensils used should first be sterilized by\r\nscalding in hot sal-soda water.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM SALT-RISING BREAD.--Put two tablespoonfuls of milk into a\r\nhalf-pint cup, add boiling water to fill the cup half full, one half\r\nteaspoonful of sugar, one fourth teaspoonful of salt, and white flour to\r\nmake a rather stiff batter. Let it rise over night. In the morning, when\r\nwell risen, add a cup and a half of warm water, or milk scalded and\r\ncooled, and sufficient white flour to form a rather stiff batter. Cover,\r\nand allow it again to rise. When light, add enough sifted Graham flour\r\nto knead. When well kneaded, shape into a loaf; allow it to become light\r\nagain in the pan, and bake. All utensils used should be first well\r\nsterilized by scalding in hot sal-soda water.\r\n\r\nUNFERMENTED BREADS.\r\n\r\nThe earliest forms of bread were made without fermentation. Grain was\r\nbroken as fine as possible by pounding on smooth stones, made into dough\r\nwith pure water, thoroughly kneaded, and baked in some convenient way.\r\nSuch was the \"unleavened breads\" or \"Passover cakes\" of the Israelites.\r\nIn many countries this bread is the only kind used. Unleavened bread\r\nmade from barley and oats is largely used by the Irish and Scotch\r\npeasantry. In Sweden an unleavened bread is made of rye meal and water,\r\nflavored with anise seed, and baked in large, thin cakes, a foot or more\r\nin diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mexican Woman Making Tortillas]\r\n\r\nSome savage tribes subsists chiefly upon excellent corn bread, made\r\nsimply of meal and water. Unleavened bread made of corn, called\r\n_tortillas_, forms the staple diet of the Mexican Indians. The corn,\r\npreviously softened by soaking in lime water, is ground to a fine paste\r\nbetween a stone slab and roller called a _metate_, then patted and\r\ntossed from hand to hand until flattened into thin, wafer-like cakes,\r\nand baked over a quick fire, on a thin iron plate or a flat stone.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably, unleavened bread, well kneaded and properly baked, is\r\nthe most wholesome of all breads, but harder to masticate than that made\r\nlight by fermentation, but this is an advantage; for it insures more\r\nthorough mixing with that important digestive agent, the saliva, than is\r\nusually given to more easily softened food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stone Metate.]\r\n\r\nWhat is usually termed unfermented bread, however, is prepared with\r\nflour and liquid, to which shortening--of some kind is added, and the\r\nwhole made light by the liberation of gas generated within the dough\r\nduring the process of baking. This is brought about either by mixing\r\nwith the flour certain chemical substances, which, when wet and brought\r\ninto contact, act upon each other so as to set free carbonic acid gas,\r\nwhich expands and puffs up the loaf; or by introducing into the dough\r\nsome volatile substance as carbonate of ammonia, which the heat during\r\nbaking will, cause to vaporize, and which in rising produces the same\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nCarbonic acid gas maybe for this purpose developed by the chemical\r\ndecomposition of bicarbonate of potassa (saleratus), or bicarbonate of\r\nsoda, by some acid such as sour milk, hydrochloric acid, tartaric acid,\r\nnitrate of potassa, or the acid phosphate of lime.\r\n\r\nThe chemical process of bread-raising originally consisted in adding to\r\nthe dough definite proportions of muriatic acid and carbonate of soda,\r\nby the union of which carbonic acid gas and common salt were produced.\r\nThis process was soon abandoned, however, on account of the propensity\r\nexhibited by the acid for eating holes in the fingers of the baker as\r\nwell as in his bread pans; and a more convenient one for hands and\r\npans, that of using soda or salaratus with cream of tartar or sour milk,\r\nwas substituted. When there is an excess of soda, a portion of it\r\nremains in the loaf uncombined, giving to the bread a yellow color and\r\nan alkaline taste, and doing mischief to the delicate coating of the\r\nstomach. Alkalies, the class of chemicals to which soda and salaratus\r\nbelong, when pure and strong, are powerful corrosive poisons. The acid\r\nused with the alkali to liberate the carbonic-acid gas in the process of\r\nbread-making, if rightly proportioned, destroys this poisonous property,\r\nand unites with it to form a new compound, which, although not a poison,\r\nis yet unwholesome.\r\n\r\nWe can hardly speak too strongly in condemnation of the use of chemicals\r\nin bread-making, when we reflect that the majority of housewives who\r\ncombine sour milk and salaratus, or cream of tartar and soda, more\r\nfrequently than otherwise _guess_ at the proportions, or measure them by\r\nsome \"rule of thumb,\" without stopping to consider that although two\r\ncups of sour milk may at one time be sufficiently acid to neutralize a\r\nteaspoonful of saleratus, milk may vary in degree of acidity to such an\r\nextent that the same quantity will be quite insufficient for the purpose\r\nat another time; or that though a teaspoonful of some brand of cream of\r\ntartar will neutralize a half teaspoonful of one kind of soda, similar\r\nmeasures will not always bring about the same result. Very seldom,\r\nindeed, will the proportions be sufficiently exact to perfectly\r\nneutralise the alkali, since chemicals are subject to variations in\r\ndegree of strength, both on account of the method by which they are\r\nmanufactured and the length of time they have been kept, to say nothing\r\nof adulterations to which they may have been subjected, and which are so\r\ncommon that it is almost impossible to find unadulterated cream of\r\ntartar in the market.\r\n\r\nBaking powders are essentially composed of bicarbonate of soda and cream\r\nof tartar, mixed in the proper proportions to exactly neutralize each\r\nother, and if they were always pure, would certainly be as good as soda\r\nand cream of tartar in any form, and possess the added advantage of\r\nperfect proportions; but as was demonstrated not long ago by the\r\ngovernment chemist, nearly every variety of baking powder in the market\r\nis largely adulterated with cheaper and harmful substances. Alum, a most\r\nfrequent constituent of such baking powders, is exceedingly injurious to\r\nthe stomach. Out of several hundred brands of baking powder examined,\r\nonly one was found pure.\r\n\r\nEven when in their purest state, these chemicals are not harmless, as is\r\nso generally believed. It is a very prevalent idea that when soda is\r\nneutralized by an acid, both chemical compounds are in some way\r\ndestroyed or vaporized in the process, and in some occult manner escape\r\nfrom the bread during the process of baking. This is altogether an\r\nerror. The alkali and acid neutralize each other chemically, but they do\r\nnot destroy each other. Their union forms a salt, exactly the same as\r\nthe Rochelle salts of medicine, a mild purgative, and if we could\r\ncollected from the bread and weigh or measure it, we would find nearly\r\nas much of it as there was of the baking powder in the first place. If\r\ntwo teaspoonfuls of baking powder to the quart of flour be used, we have\r\nremaining in the bread made with that amount of flour 165 grains of\r\ncrystallized Rochelle salts, or 45 grains more than this to be found in\r\na Seidlitz powder. It may be sometimes useful to take a dose of salts,\r\nbut the daily consumption of such chemical substances in bread can\r\nhardly be considered compatible with the conditions necessary for the\r\nmaintenance of health. These chemical substances are unusable by the\r\nsystem, and must all be removed by the liver and excretory organs, thus\r\nimposing upon them an extra and unnecessary burden. It has also been\r\ndetermined by scientific experimentation that the chemicals found in\r\nbaking powders in bread retard digestion.\r\n\r\nThese substances are, fortunately, not needed for the production of good\r\nlight bread. The purpose of their use is the production of a gas; but\r\nair is a gas much more economical and abundant than carbonic-acid gas,\r\nand which, when introduced into bread and subjected to heat, has the\r\nproperty of expanding, and in doing, puffing up the bread and making it\r\nlight. Bread made light with air is vastly superior to that compounded\r\nwith soda or baking powder, in point of healthfulness, and when well\r\nprepared, will equal it in lightness and palatableness. The only\r\ndifficulty lies in catching and holding the air until it has\r\naccomplished the desired results. But a thorough understanding of the\r\nnecessary conditions and a little practice will soon enable one to\r\nattain sufficient skill in this direction to secure most satisfactory\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gem Irons]\r\n\r\nGENERAL DIRECTIONS.--All materials used for making aërated bread\r\nshould be of the very best quality. Poor flour will not produce good\r\nbread by this or by any other process. Aërated breads are of two kinds:\r\nthose baked while in the form of a batter, and such as are made into a\r\ndough before baking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Perforated Sheet Iron Pan for Rolls.]\r\n\r\nAll breads, whether fermented or unfermented, are lighter if baked in\r\nsome small form, and this is particularly true of unfermented breads\r\nmade light with air. For this reason, breads made into a dough are best\r\nbaked in the form of rolls, biscuits, or crackers, and batter breads in\r\nsmall iron cups similar to those in the accompanying illustration. These\r\ncups or \"gem irons\" as they are sometimes called, are to be obtained in\r\nvarious shapes and sizes, but for this purpose the more shallow cups are\r\npreferable. For baking the dough breads a perforated sheet of Russia\r\niron or heavy tin, which any tinner can make to fit the oven, is the\r\nmost serviceable, as it permits the hot air free access to all sides of\r\nthe bread at once. If such is not obtainable, the upper oven grate,\r\ncarefully washed and scoured, may be used Perforated pie tins also\r\nanswer very well for this purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Making Unfermented Bread.]\r\n\r\nThe heat of the oven for baking should be sufficient to form a slight\r\ncrust over all sides of the bread before the air escapes, but not\r\nsufficient to brown it within the first fifteen minutes. To aid in\r\nforming the crust on the sides and bottom of batter breads, the iron\r\ncups should be heated previous to introducing the batter. The degree of\r\nheat required for baking will be about the same as for fermented rolls\r\nand biscuit, and the fire should be so arranged as to keep a steady but\r\nnot greatly increasing heat.\r\n\r\nAir is incorporated into batter breads by brisk and continuous agitating\r\nand beating; into dough breads by thorough kneading, chopping, or\r\npounding.\r\n\r\nWhatever the process by which the air is incorporated, it must be\r\n_continuous_. For this reason it is especially essential in making\r\naërated bread that every thing be in readiness before commencing to put\r\nthe bread together. All the materials should be measured out, the\r\nutensils to be used in readiness, and the oven properly heated. Success\r\nis also dependent upon the dexterity with which the materials when ready\r\nare put together. Batter bread often proves a failure although the\r\nbeating is kept up without cessation, because it is done slowly and\r\ncarelessly, or interspersed with stirring, thus permitting the air to\r\nescape between the strokes.\r\n\r\nIf the bread is to be baked at once, the greater the dispatch with which\r\nit can be gotten into a properly-heated oven the lighter it will be.\r\nCrackers, rolls and other forms of dough breads often lack in lightness\r\nbecause they were allowed to stand some time before baking. The same is\r\ntrue of batter breads. If, for any reason, it is necessary to keep such\r\nbreads for any length of time after being prepared, before baking, set\r\nthe dish containing them directly on ice.\r\n\r\nThe lightness of aërated bread depends not only upon the amount of air\r\nincorporated in its preparation, but also upon the expansion of the air\r\nduring the baking. The colder the air, the greater will be its expansion\r\nupon the application of heat. The colder the materials employed, then,\r\nfor the bread-making, the colder will be the air confined within it, and\r\nthe lighter will be the bread. For this reason, in making batter bread,\r\nit will be found a good plan, when there is time, to put the materials\r\ntogether, and place the dish containing the mixture on ice for an hour\r\nor two, or even over night. When ready to use, beat thoroughly for ten\r\nor fifteen minutes to incorporate air, and bake in heated irons. Rolls\r\nand other breads made into a dough, may be kneaded and shaped and put\r\nupon ice to become cold. Thus treated, less kneading is necessary than\r\nwhen prepared to be baked at once.\r\n\r\nMany of the recipes given for the batter breads include eggs. The yolk\r\nis not particularly essential, and if it can be put to other uses, may\r\nbe left out. The white of an egg, because of its viscous nature, when\r\nbeaten, serves as a sort of trap to catch and hold air, and added to the\r\nbread, aids in making it light. Very nice light bread may be made\r\nwithout eggs, but the novice in making aërated breads will, perhaps,\r\nfind it an advantage first to become perfectly familiar with the\r\nprocesses and conditions involved, by using the recipes with eggs before\r\nattempting those without, which are somewhat more dependent for success\r\nupon skill and practice.\r\n\r\nWhen egg is used in the bread, less heating of the irons will be\r\nnecessary, and not so hot an oven as when made without.\r\n\r\nIf the bread, when baked, appears light, but with large holes in the\r\ncenter, it is probable that either the irons or the oven was too hot at\r\nfirst. If the bread after baking, seems sticky or dough-like in the\r\ninterior, it is an indication that either it was insufficiently baked,\r\nor that not enough flour in proportion to the liquid has been used. It\r\nshould be stated, that although the recipes given have been prepared\r\nwith the greatest care, and with the same brands of flour, careful\r\nmeasurement, and proper conditions, prove successful every time, yet\r\nwith different brands of flour some variation in quantity may needed,--a\r\ntrifle more or less,--dependent upon the absorbent properties of the\r\nflour, and if eggs are used, upon the size of the eggs.\r\n\r\nA heavy bread may be the result of the use of poor flour, too much\r\nflour, careless or insufficient beating, so that not enough air was\r\nincorporated, or an oven not sufficiently hot to form a crust over the\r\nbread before the air escaped. Breads made into a dough, if moist and\r\nclammy, require more flour or longer baking. Too much flour will make\r\nthem stiff and hard.\r\n\r\nThe length of time requisite for baking aërated breads made with\r\nwhole-wheat, wheat berry, or Graham flours, will vary from forty minutes\r\nto one hour, according to the kind and form in which the bread is baked,\r\nand the heat of the oven.\r\n\r\nThe irons in which batter breads are to be baked should not be smeared\r\nwith grease; if necessary to oil them at all, they should only be wiped\r\nout lightly with a clean, oiled cloth. Irons well cared for, carefully\r\nwashed, and occasionally scoured with Sapolio to keep them perfectly\r\nsmooth, will require no greasing whatever.\r\n\r\nIn filling the irons, care should be taken to fill each cup at first as\r\nfull as it is intended to have; it, as the heat of the irons begins the\r\ncooking of the batter as soon as it is put in, and an additional\r\nquantity added has a tendency to make the bread less light.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nWHOLE-WHEAT PUFFS.--Put the yolk of an egg into a basin, and beat\r\nthe white in a separate dish to a stiff froth. Add to the yolk, one half\r\na cupful of rather thin sweet cream and one cupful of skim milk. Beat\r\nthe egg, cream, and milk together until perfectly mingled and foamy with\r\nair bubbles; then add, gradually, beating well at the same time, one\r\npint of wheat berry flour. Continue the beating vigorously and without\r\ninterruption for eight or ten minutes; then stir in, lightly, the white\r\nof the egg. Do not beat again after the white of the egg is added, but\r\nturn at once into heated, shallow irons, and bake for an hour in a\r\nmoderately quick oven. If properly made and carefully baked, these puffs\r\nwill be of a fine, even texture throughout, and as light as bread raised\r\nby fermentation.\r\n\r\nWHOLE-WHEAT PUFFS NO. 2.--Make a batter by beating together until\r\nperfectly smooth the yolk of one egg, one and one half cups of new or\r\nunskimmed milk, and one pint of whole-wheat flour. Place the dish\r\ncontaining it directly upon ice, and leave for an hour or longer. The\r\nbread may be prepared and left on the ice over night, if desired for\r\nbreakfast. When ready to bake the puffs, whip the white of the egg to a\r\nstiff froth, and after vigorously beating the batter for ten minutes,\r\nstir in lightly the white of the egg; turn at once into heated irons,\r\nand bake. If preferred, one third white flour and two thirds sifted\r\nGraham flour may be used in the place of the wheat berry flour.\r\n\r\nWHOLE-WHEAT PUFFS NO. 3.--Take one cupful of sweet cream\r\n(twelve-hour cream), one half cupful of soft ice water, and two slightly\r\nrounded cupfuls of wheat berry flour. Beat the material well together,\r\nand set the dish containing it on ice for an hour or more before using.\r\nWhen ready to bake, beat the mixture vigorously for ten minutes, then\r\nturn into heated iron cups (shallow ones are best), and bake for about\r\nan hour in a quick oven.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM PUFFS.--Beat together vigorously until full of air bubbles,\r\none pint of unskimmed milk, the yolk of one egg, and one pint and three\r\nor four tablespoonfuls of Graham flour, added a little at a time. When\r\nthe mixture is light and foamy throughout, stir in lightly and evenly\r\nthe white of the egg, beaten to a stiff froth; turn into heated irons,\r\nand bake in a rather quick oven. Instead of all Graham, one third white\r\nflour may be used if preferred.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM PUFFS NO. 2.--Beat the yolks of two eggs in two cupfuls of\r\nice water; then add gradually, beating well meantime, three and one\r\nfourth cupfuls of Graham flour. Continue the beating, after all the\r\nflour is added, until the mixture is light and full of air bubbles. Add\r\nlast the whites of the eggs, beaten to a stiff froth, and bake at once\r\nin heated irons.\r\n\r\nCURRANT PUFFS.--Prepare the puffs as directed in any of the\r\nforegoing recipes with the addition of one cup of Zante currants which\r\nhave been well washed, dried, and floured.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM GEMS.--Into two cupfuls of unskimmed milk which has been\r\nmade very cold by standing on ice, stir gradually, sprinkling it from\r\nthe hand, three and one fourth cupfuls of Graham flour. Beat vigorously\r\nfor ten minutes or longer, until the batter is perfectly smooth and full\r\nof air bubbles. Turn at once into hissing hot gem irons, and bake in a\r\nhot oven. If preferred, the batter may be prepared, and the dish\r\ncontaining it placed on ice for an hour or longer; then well beaten and\r\nbaked. Graham gems may be made in this manner with soft water instead of\r\nmilk, but such, in general, will need a little more flour than when made\r\nwith milk. With some ovens, it will be found an advantage in baking\r\nthese gems to place them on the upper grate for the first ten minutes or\r\nuntil the top has been slightly crusted, and then change to the bottom\r\nof the oven for the baking.\r\n\r\nCRUSTS.--Beat together very thoroughly one cupful of ice-cold milk,\r\nand one cupful of Graham flour. When very light and full of air bubbles,\r\nturn into hot iron cups, and bake twenty-five or thirty minutes. The\r\nbest irons for this purpose are the shallow oblong, or round cups of the\r\nsame size at the bottom as at the top. Only a very little batter should\r\nbe put in each cup. The quantity given is sufficient for one dozen\r\ncrusts.\r\n\r\nRYE PUFFS.--Beat together the same as for whole-wheat puffs one\r\ncupful of milk, one tablespoonful of sugar, and the yolk of an egg. Add\r\none cupful of good rye flour, mixed with one half cupful of Graham\r\nflour, and stir in lastly the well beaten white of the egg. Bake at\r\nonce, in heated gem-irons.\r\n\r\nRYE PUFFS NO. 2.--Beat together until well mingled one pint of thin\r\ncream and the yolk of one egg. Add gradually, beating meanwhile, four\r\ncups of rye flour. Continue to beat vigorously for ten minutes, then add\r\nthe stiffly-beaten white of the egg, and bake in heated irons.\r\n\r\nRYE GEMS.--Mix together one cupful of corn meal and one cupful of\r\nrye meal. Stir the mixed meal into one and a half cupfuls of ice water.\r\nBeat the batter vigorously for ten or fifteen minutes, then turn into\r\nhot irons, and bake.\r\n\r\nBLUEBERRY GEMS.--To one cupful of rich milk add one tablespoonful\r\nof sugar, and the yolk of an egg. Beat well till full of air bubbles;\r\nthen add gradually one cupful of Graham flour, and one cupful of white\r\nflour, or white corn meal. Beat vigorously until light; stir in the\r\nbeaten white of the egg, and one cupful of fresh, sound blueberries.\r\nBake in heated irons, in a moderately quick oven. Chopped or sour apples\r\nmay be used in place of the berries.\r\n\r\nHOMINY GEMS.--Beat one egg until very light, add to it one\r\ntablespoonful of thick sweet cream, a little salt if desired, and two\r\ncupfuls of cooked hominy (fine). Thin the mixture with one cupful or\r\nless of boiling water until it will form easily, beat well, and bake in\r\nheated irons.\r\n\r\nSALLY LUNN GEMS.--Beat together the yolk of one egg, two\r\ntablespoonfuls of sugar, and one cupful of thin, ice-cold, sweet cream.\r\nAdd slowly, beating at the same time, one cup and two tablespoonfuls of\r\nsifted Graham flour. Beat vigorously, until full of air bubbles, add the\r\nwhite of the egg beaten stiffly, and bake in heated irons.\r\n\r\nCORN PUFFS.--Mingle the yolk of one egg with one cupful of rich\r\nmilk. Add to the liquid one cupful of flour, one-half cupful of fine,\r\nyellow corn meal, and one-fourth cupful of sugar, all of which have\r\npreviously been well mixed together. Place the batter on ice for an\r\nhour, or until very cold. Then beat it vigorously five or ten minutes,\r\ntill full of air bubbles; stir in lightly the stiffly beaten white of\r\nthe egg, and put at once into heated irons. Bake in a moderately quick\r\noven, thirty or forty minutes.\r\n\r\nCORN PUFFS NO. 2.--Scald two cupfuls of fine white corn meal with\r\nboiling water. When cold, add three tablespoonfuls of thin sweet cream,\r\nand the yolk of one egg. Beat well, and stir in lastly the white of the\r\negg, beaten to a stiff froth. The batter should be sufficiently thin to\r\ndrop easily from a spoon, but not thin enough to pour. Bake in heated\r\nirons, in a moderately quick oven.\r\n\r\nCORN PUFFS NO. 3.--Take one cupful of cold mashed potato, and one\r\ncupful of milk, rubbed together through a colander to remove all lumps.\r\nAdd the yolk of one well beaten, egg, and then stir in slowly, beating\r\nvigorously meantime, one cupful of good corn meal. Lastly, stir in the\r\nwhite of the egg beaten to a stiff froth, and bake in heated irons, in a\r\nrather quick oven.\r\n\r\nCORN PUFFS NO. 4.--Beat together one and one-half cupfuls of\r\nunskimmed milk and the yolks of two eggs, until thoroughly blended. Add\r\ntwo cupfuls of flour, and one cupful best granular corn meal. Beat the\r\nbatter thoroughly; stir in lightly the whites of the eggs, beaten to a\r\nstiff froth, turn into heated irons, and bake.\r\n\r\nCORN DODGERS.--Scald one cupful of best granular corn meal, with\r\nwhich a tablespoonful of sugar has been sifted, with one cup of boiling\r\nmilk. Beat until smooth, and drop on a griddle, in cakes about one inch\r\nin thickness, and bake slowly for an hour. Turn when brown.\r\n\r\nCORN DODGERS NO. 2.--Mix one tablespoonful of sugar with two cups\r\nbest corn meal. Scald with one cup of boiling water. Add rich milk to\r\nmake a batter thin enough to drop from a spoon. Lastly, add one egg,\r\nyolk and white beaten separately, and bake on a griddle in the oven from\r\nthree fourth of an hour to one hour.\r\n\r\nCREAM CORN CAKES.--Into one cup of thin cream stir one and one half\r\ncups of granular corn meal, or enough to make a stiff batter; beat well,\r\ndrop into heated irons, and bake.\r\n\r\nHOE CAKES.--Scald one pint of white corn meal, with which, if\r\ndesired, a tablespoonful of sugar, and one half teaspoonful of salt have\r\nbeen mixed, with boiling milk, or water enough to make a batter\r\nsufficiently thick not to spread. Drop on a hot griddle, in large or\r\nsmall cakes, as preferred, about one half inch in thickness. Cook\r\nslowly, and when well browned on the under side, turn over. The cake may\r\nbe cooked slowly, until well done throughout, or, as the portion\r\nunderneath becomes well browned the first browned crust may be peeled\r\noff with a knife, and the cake again turned. As rapidly as a crust\r\nbecomes formed and browned, one may be removed, and the cake turned,\r\nuntil the whole is all browned. The thin wafer-like crusts are excellent\r\nserved with hot milk or cream.\r\n\r\nOATMEAL GEMS.--To one cupful of well-cooked oatmeal add one half\r\ncupful of rich milk or thin cream, and the yolk of one egg. Beat all\r\ntogether thoroughly; then add, continuing to beat, one and one third\r\ncupfuls of Graham flour, and lastly the stiffly beaten white of the egg.\r\nBake in heated irons. If preferred, one cupful of white flour may be\r\nused in place of the Graham.\r\n\r\nSNOW GEMS.--Beat together lightly but thoroughly two parts clean,\r\nfreshly fallen, dry snow, and one part best granular corn meal. Turn\r\ninto hot gem irons and bake quickly. The snow should not be packed in\r\nmeasuring, and the bread should be prepared before the snow melts.\r\n\r\nPOP OVERS.--For the preparation of these, one egg, one cupful of\r\nmilk, and one scant cupful of white flour are required. Beat the egg,\r\nyolk and white separately. Add to the yolk, when well beaten, one half\r\nof the milk, and sift in the flour a little at a time, stirring until\r\nthe whole is a perfectly smooth paste. Add the remainder of the milk\r\ngradually, beating well until the whole is an absolutely smooth, light\r\nbatter about the thickness of cream. Stir in the stiffly beaten white of\r\nthe egg, and bake in hot earthen cups or muffin rings, and to prevent\r\nthem from sticking, sift flour into the rings after slightly oiling,\r\nafterward turning them upside down to shake off all of the loose flour.\r\n\r\nGRANOLA GEMS.--Into three fourths of a cup of rich milk stir one\r\ncup of Granola (prepared by the Sanitarium Food Co.). Drop into heated\r\nirons, and bake for twenty or thirty minutes.\r\n\r\nBEAN GEMS.--Prepare the gems in the same manner as for Whole-Wheat\r\nPuffs, using one half cup of milk, one egg, one cup of cooked beans\r\nwhich have been rubbed through a colander and salted, and one cup and\r\none tablespoonful of white flour. A little variation in the quantity of\r\nthe flour may be necessary, dependent upon the moisture contained in the\r\nbeans, although care should be taken to have them quite dry.\r\n\r\nBREAKFAST ROLLS.--Sift a pint and a half of Graham flour into a\r\nbowl, and into it stir a cupful of very cold thin cream or unskimmed\r\nmilk. Pour the liquid into the flour slowly, a few spoonfuls at a time,\r\nmixing each spoonful to a dough with the flour as fast as poured in.\r\nWhen all the liquid has been added, gather the fragments of dough\r\ntogether, knead thoroughly for ten minutes or longer, until perfectly\r\nsmooth and elastic. The quantity of flour will vary somewhat with the\r\nquality, but in general, the quantity given will be quite sufficient for\r\nmixing the dough and dusting the board. When well kneaded, divide into\r\ntwo portions; roll each over and over with the hands, until a long roll\r\nabout once inch in diameter is formed; cut this into two-inch lengths,\r\nprick with a fork and place on perforated tins, far enough apart so that\r\none will not touch another when baking. Each roll should be as smooth\r\nand perfect as possible, and with no dry flour adhering. Bake at once,\r\nor let stand on ice for twenty minutes. The rolls should not be allowed\r\nto stand after forming, unless on ice. From thirty to forty minutes will\r\nbe required for baking. When done, spread on the table to cool, but do\r\nnot pile one on top of another.\r\n\r\nVery nice rolls may be made in the same manner, using for the wetting\r\nice-cold soft water. They requite a longer kneading, are more crisp, but\r\nless tender than those made with cream.\r\n\r\nWith some brands of Graham flour the rolls will be much lighter if one\r\nthird white flour be used. Whole-wheat flour may be used in place of\r\nGraham, if preferred.\r\n\r\nSTICKS.--Prepare, and knead the dough the same as for rolls. When\r\nready to form, roll the dough much smaller; scarcely larger than one's\r\nlittle finger, and cut into three or four-inch lengths. Bake the same as\r\nrolls, for about twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nCREAM GRAHAM RAILS.--To one half cup cold cream add one half cup of\r\nsoft ice water. Make into a dough with three cups of Graham flour,\r\nsprinkling in slowly with the hands, beating at the same time, so as to\r\nincorporate as much air as possible, until the dough is too stiff to be\r\nstirred; then knead thoroughly, form into rolls, and bake.\r\n\r\nCORN MUSH ROLLS.--Make a dough of one cup of corn meal mush, one\r\nhalf cup of cream, and two and one half cups of white flour; knead\r\nthoroughly, shape into rolls, and bake.\r\n\r\nFRUIT ROLLS.--Prepare the rolls as directed in the recipe for\r\nBreakfast Rolls, and when well kneaded, work into the dough a half\r\ncupful of Zante currants which have been well washed, dried, and\r\nfloured. Form the rolls in the usual manner, and bake.\r\n\r\nCREAM MUSH ROLLS.--Into a cupful of cold Graham mush beat\r\nthoroughly three tablespoonfuls of thick, sweet cream. Add sufficient\r\nGraham flour to make a rather stiff dough, knead thoroughly, shape into\r\nroils, and bake. Corn meal, farina, and other mushes may be used in the\r\nplace of the Graham mush, if preferred.\r\n\r\nBEATEN BISCUIT.--Into a quart of whole-wheat flour mix a large cup\r\nof must be very stiff, and rendered soft and pliable by thorough\r\nkneading and afterward pounding with a mallet for at least half an hour\r\nin the following manner: Pound the dough oat flat, and until of the same\r\nthickness throughout; dredge lightly with flour; double the dough over\r\nevenly and pound quickly around the outside, to fasten the edges\r\ntogether and thus retain the air within the dough. When well worked, the\r\ndough will appear flaky and brittle, and pulling a piece off it quickly\r\nwill cause a sharp, snapping sound. Mold into small biscuits, making an\r\nindenture in the center of each with the thumb, prick well with a fork,\r\nand place on perforated sheets, with a space between, and put at once\r\ninto the oven. The oven should be of the same temperature as for rolls.\r\nIf they are \"sad\" inside when cold, they were not well baked, as they\r\nshould be light and tender. If preferred, use one third white flour,\r\ninstead of all whole-wheat. Excellent results are also obtained by\r\nchopping instead of pounding the dough.\r\n\r\nCREAM CRISPS.--Make a dough of one cupful of thin cream, and a\r\nlittle more than three cups of Graham flour. Knead until smooth, then\r\ndivide the dough into several pieces, and place in a dish on ice for an\r\nhour, or until ice cold. Roll each piece separately and quickly as thin\r\nas brown paper. Cut with a knife into squares, prick with a fork, and\r\nbake on perforated tins, until lightly browned on both sides.\r\n\r\nCREAM CRISPS NO. 2.--Into two and one half cups of cold cream or\r\nrich milk, sprinkle slowly with the hands, beating meanwhile to\r\nincorporate air, four cups of best Graham flour, sifted with one half\r\ncup of granulated sugar. Add flour to knead; about two and one fourth\r\ncups will be required. When well kneaded, divide into several portions,\r\nroll each as thin as a knife blade, cut into squares, prick well with a\r\nfork, and bake.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM CRISPS.--Into one half cupful of ice-cold soft water, stir\r\nslowly, so as to incorporate as much air as possible, enough Graham\r\nflour to make a dough stiff enough to knead. A tablespoonful of sugar\r\nmay be added to the water before stirring in the flour, if desired.\r\nAfter kneading fifteen minutes, divide the dough into six portions;\r\nroll each as thin as brown paper, prick with a fork, and bake on\r\nperforated tins, turning often until both sides are a light, even brown.\r\nBreak into irregular pieces and serve.\r\n\r\nOATMEAL CRISPS.--Make a dough with one cupful of oatmeal porridge\r\nand Graham flour. Knead thoroughly, roll very thin, and bake as directed\r\nfor Graham Crisps. A tablespoonful of sugar may be added if desired.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM CRACKERS.--Make a dough of one cup of cream and Graham flour\r\nsufficient to make a soft dough. Knead thoroughly, and place on ice for\r\nhalf an hour; then roll thin, cut into small cakes with a cookie-cutter,\r\nprick with a fork, and bake on floured pans, in a brisk oven. A\r\ntablespoonful of sugar may be added if desired.\r\n\r\nFRUIT CRACKERS.--Prepare a dough with one cup of cold sweet cream\r\nand three cups of Graham flour, knead well, and divide into two\r\nportions. Roll each quite thin. Spread one thickly with dates or figs\r\nseeded and chopped; place the other one on top and press together with\r\nthe rolling pin. Cut into squares and bake. An additional one fourth of\r\na cup of flour will doubtless be needed for dusting the board and\r\nkneading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE TOPICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Behind the nutty loaf is the mill wheel; behind the mill is the\r\n    wheat field; on the wheat field rests the sunlight; above the sun is\r\n    God.--_James Russell Lowell._\r\n\r\n\r\n    Bread forms one of the most important parts of the ration of the\r\n    German soldier. In time of peace, the private soldier is supplied\r\n    day by day with one pound and nine ounces of bread; when fighting\r\n    for the Fatherland, every man is entitled to a free ration of over\r\n    two pounds of bread, and field bakery trains and steam ovens for\r\n    providing the large amount of bread required, form a recognized part\r\n    of the equipment of the German army.\r\n\r\n    The wandering Arab lives almost entirely upon bread, with a few\r\n    dates as a relish.\r\n\r\n    According to Count Rumford, the Bavarian wood-chopper, one of the\r\n    most hardy and hard-working men in the world, receives for his\r\n    weekly rations one large loaf of rye bread and a small quantity of\r\n    roasted meal. Of the meal he makes an infusion, to which he adds a\r\n    little salt, and with the mixture, which he calls burned soup, he\r\n    eats his rye bread. No beer, no beef, no other food than that\r\n    mentioned, and no drink but water; and yet he can do more work and\r\n    enjoys a better digestion and possesses stronger muscles than the\r\n    average American or Englishman, with their varied dietary.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following truthful bit of Scandinavian history well illustrates\r\n    the influence of habits of frugality upon national character: \"The\r\n    Danes were approaching, and one of the Swedish bishops asked how\r\n    many men the province of Dalarna could furnish.\r\n\r\n    \"'At least twenty thousand,' was the reply; 'for the old men are\r\n    just as strong and brave as the young ones.'\r\n\r\n    \"'But what do they live upon?'\r\n\r\n    \"'Upon bread and water. They take little account of hunger and\r\n    thirst, and when corn is lacking, they make their bread out of tree\r\n    bark.'\r\n\r\n    \"'Nay,' said the bishop, 'a people who eat tree bark and drink\r\n    water, the devil himself could not vanquish!' and neither were they\r\n    vanquished. Their progress was one series of triumphs, till they\r\n    placed Gustavus Vasa on the throne of Sweden.\"\r\n\r\n    The word _biscuit_ embodies the process by which this form of bread\r\n    was made from time immemorial down to within the last century. _Bis_\r\n    (twice), and _coctus_ (cooked), show that they were twice baked.\r\n\r\n    Fragments of unfermented bread were discovered in the Swiss\r\n    lake-dwellings, which belong to the Neolithic age.\r\n\r\n    Fermented bread is seldom seen in Northern Europe and Asia except\r\n    among the rich or the nobility. At one time, the captain of an\r\n    English vessel requested a baker of Gottenburg to bake a large\r\n    quantity of loaves of raised bread. The baker refused to undertake\r\n    an order of such magnitude, saying it would be quite impossible to\r\n    dispose of so much, until the captain agreed to take and pay for it\r\n    all.\r\n\r\n    I made a study of the ancient and indispensable art of bread-making,\r\n    consulting such authorities as offered, going back to the primitive\r\n    days and first invention of the unleavened kind, and traveling\r\n    gradually down in my studies through that accidental souring of the\r\n    dough which it is supposed taught the leavening process, and through\r\n    the various fermentations thereafter till I came to \"good, sweet,\r\n    wholesome bread,\"--the staff of life. Leaven, which some deemed the\r\n    soul of bread, the _spiritus_ which fills its cellular tissues,\r\n    which is religiously preserved like the vestal fire,--some precious\r\n    bottleful, I suppose, brought over in the Mayflower, did the\r\n    business for America, and its influence is still rising, swelling,\r\n    spreading in cerulean billows over the land,--this seed I regularly\r\n    and faithfully procured from the village, until one morning I forgot\r\n    the rules and scalded my yeast; by which accident I discovered that\r\n    even this was not indispensable, and I have gladly omitted it ever\r\n    since. Neither did I put any soda or other acid or alkali into my\r\n    bread. It would seem that I made it according to the recipe which\r\n    Marcus Porcius Cato gave about two centuries before Christ: \"Make\r\n    kneaded bread thus: Wash your hands and trough well. Put the meal\r\n    into the trough, add water gradually, and knead it thoroughly. When\r\n    you have needed it well, mold it, and bake it under a cover,\" that\r\n    is in a baking kettle.--_Thoreau in Walden._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUITS\r\n\r\nOf all the articles which enter the list of foods, none are more\r\nwholesome and pleasing than the fruits which nature so abundantly\r\nprovides. Their delicate hues and perfect outlines appeal to our sense\r\nof beauty, while their delicious flavors gratify our appetite. Our\r\nmarkets are supplied with an almost unlimited variety of both native and\r\ntropical fruits, and it might be supposed that they would always appear\r\nupon the daily bill of fare; yet in the majority of homes this is rarely\r\nthe case. People are inclined to consider fruit, unless the product of\r\ntheir own gardens, a luxury too expensive for common use. Many who use a\r\nplentiful supply, never think of placing it upon their tables, unless\r\ncooked. Ripe fruit is a most healthful article of diet when partaken of\r\nat seasonable times; but to eat it, or any other food, between meals, is\r\na gross breach of the requirements of good digestion.\r\n\r\nFruits contain from seventy-five to ninety-five per cent of water, and a\r\nmeager proportion of nitrogenous matter; hence their value as\r\nnutrients, except in a few instances, is rather small; but they supply a\r\nvariety of agreeable acids which refresh and give tone to the system,\r\nand their abundant and proper use does much to keep the vital machinery\r\nin good working order.\r\n\r\nAside from the skin and seeds, all fruits consist essentially of two\r\nparts,--the cellulose structure containing the juice, and the juice\r\nitself. The latter is water, with a small proportion of fruit sugar\r\n(from one to twenty per cent in different varieties), and vegetable\r\nacids. These acids are either free, or combined with potash and lime in\r\nthe form of acid salts. They are mallic, citric, tartaric, and pectic\r\nacids. The last-named is the jelly-producing principle.\r\n\r\nWhile the juice, as we commonly find it, is readily transformable for\r\nuse in the system, the cellular structure of the fruit is not so easily\r\ndigested. In some fruits, as the strawberry, grape, and banana, the cell\r\nwalls are so delicate as to be easily broken up; but in watermelons,\r\napples, and oranges, the cells are coarser, and form a larger bulk of\r\nthe fruit, hence are less easily digested. As a rule, other points being\r\nequal, the fruits which yield the richest and largest quantity of\r\njuices, and also possess a cellular framework the least perceptible on\r\nmastication, are the most readily digested. A certain amount of waste\r\nmatter is an advantage, to give bulk to our food; but persons with weak\r\nstomachs, who cannot eat certain kinds of fruit, are often able to\r\ndigest the juice when taken alone.\r\n\r\nUnripe fruits differ from ripe fruits in that they contain, starch,\r\nwhich during ripening is changed into sugar, and generally some\r\nproportion of tannic acid, which gives them their astringency. The\r\ncharacteristic constituent of unripe fruit, however, is pectose, an\r\nelement insoluble in water, but which, as maturation proceeds, is\r\ntransformed into pectic and pectosic acids. These are soluble in boiling\r\nwater, and upon cooling, yield gelatinous solutions. Their presence\r\nmakes it possible to convert the juice of ripe fruits into jelly. Raw\r\nstarch in any form is indigestible, hence unripe fruit should never be\r\neaten uncooked. As fruit matures, the changes it undergoes are such as\r\nbest fit for consumption and digestion.

When such\r\nderangement occurs, it is far more likely to have been occasioned by the\r\nway in which the fruit was eaten than by the fruit itself. Perhaps it\r\nwas taken as a surfeit dish at the end of a meal. It may have been eaten\r\nin combination with rich, oily foods, pastry, strong coffee, and other\r\nindigestible viands, which, in themselves, often excite an attack of\r\nindigestion. Possibly it was partaken of between meals, or late at\r\nnight, with ice cream and other confections, or it was swallowed without\r\nsufficient mastication. Certainly, it is not marvelous that stomach and\r\nbowel disorders do result under such circumstances. The innocent fruit,\r\nlike many other good things, being found in \"bad company,\" is blamed\r\naccordingly. An excess of any food at meals or between meals, is likely\r\nto prove injurious, and fruits present no exception to this rule. Fruit\r\ntaken at seasonable times and in suitable quantities, alone or in\r\ncombination with proper foods, gives us one of the most agreeable and\r\nhealthful articles of diet. Fruit, fats, and meats do not affiliate, and\r\nthey are liable to create a disturbance whenever taken together.\r\n\r\nPartially decayed, stale, and over-ripe, as well as unripe fruit, should\r\nnever be eaten. According to M. Pasteur, the French scientist, all\r\nfruits and vegetables, when undergoing even incipient decay, contain\r\nnumerous germs, which, introduced into the system, are liable to produce\r\ndisturbances or disease. Perfectly fresh, ripe fruit, with proper\r\nlimitations as to quantity and occasion, may be taken into a normal\r\nstomach with impunity at any season.\r\n\r\nIt is especially important that all fruits to be eaten should not only\r\nbe sound in quality, but should be made perfectly clean by washing if\r\nnecessary, since fruit grown near the ground is liable to be covered\r\nwith dangerous bacteria (such as cause typhoid fever or diphtheria),\r\nwhich exist in the soil or in the material used in fertilizing it.\r\n\r\nMost fruits, properly used, aid digestion either directly or indirectly.\r\nThe juicy ones act as dilutents, and their free use lessens the desire\r\nfor alcohol and other stimulants. According to German analysts, the\r\napple contains a larger percentage of phosphorus than any other fruit,\r\nor than any vegetable. In warm weather and in warm climates, when foods\r\nare not needed for a heat-producing purpose, the diet may well consist\r\nlargely of fruits and succulent vegetables, eaten in combination with\r\nbread and grains. In case of liver and kidney affections, rheumatism,\r\nand gout, the use of fruit is considered very beneficial by many\r\nscientific authorities.\r\n\r\nTo serve its best purpose, raw fruit should be eaten without sugar or\r\nother condiments, or with the addition of as small a quantity as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nIt is a disputed question whether fruits should begin or end the meal;\r\nbut it is generally conceded by those who have given the matter\r\nattention, that fruit eaten at the beginning of a meal is itself the\r\nmore readily digested, and aids in the digestion of other foods, since\r\nfruits, like soups, have the property of stimulating the flow of the\r\ndigestive juices. Something, however, must depend upon the character of\r\nthe fruit; oranges, melons, and like juicy fruits, are especially useful\r\nas appetizers to begin the meal, while bananas and similar fruits agree\r\nbetter if taken with other food, so as to secure thorough mixture with\r\nsaliva. This is true of all fruits, except such pulpy fruits as\r\nstrawberries, peaches, melons, grapes, and oranges. It is often\r\nerroneously asserted that fruit as dessert is injurious to digestion.\r\nFor those people, however, who regulate their bill of fare in accordance\r\nwith the principles of hygiene, a simple course of fruit is not only\r\nwholesome, but is all that is needed after a dinner; and much time,\r\nlabor, and health will be saved when housekeepers are content to serve\r\ndesserts which nature supplies all ready for use, instead of those\r\nharmful combinations in the preparing of which they spend hours of\r\ntiresome toil.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--For convenience, fruits may be grouped together; as,\r\n_pomaceous_ fruits, including the apple, quince, pear, etc.; the\r\n_drupaceous_ fruits, those provided with a hard stone surrounded by a\r\nfleshy pulp, as the peach, apricot, plum, cherry, olive, and date; the\r\norange or citron group, including the orange, lemon, lime, citron, grape\r\nfruit, shaddock, and pomegranate; the _baccate_ or berry kind,\r\ncomprising the grape, gooseberry, currant, cranberry, whortleberry,\r\nblueberry, and others; the _arterio_ group, to which belong raspberries,\r\nstrawberries, dewberries, and blackberries; the fig group; the gourd\r\ngroup, including--melons and cantaloupes; and foreign fruits.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, in the brief scope of this work, to enumerate the\r\ninfinite varieties of fruit; but we will briefly speak of some of the\r\nmost common found in the gardens and markets of this latitude.\r\n\r\nAPPLES.--The origin and first home of the apple, is unknown. If\r\ntradition is to be believed, it was the inauspicious fruit to which may\r\nbe traced all the miseries of mankind. In pictures of the temptation in\r\nthe garden of Eden, our mother Eve is generally represented as holding\r\nan apple in her hand.\r\n\r\nWe find the apple mentioned in the mythologies of the Greeks, Druids,\r\nand Scandinavians. The Thebans offered apples instead of sheep as a\r\nsacrifice to Hercules, a custom derived from the following\r\ncircumstance:--\r\n\r\n\"At one time, when a sacrifice was necessary, the river Asopus had so\r\ninundated the country that it was impossible to take a sheep across it\r\nfor the purpose, when some youths, recollecting that the Greek word\r\n_melon_ signified both sheep and an apple, stuck wooden pegs into the\r\nfruit to represent legs, and brought this vegetable quadruped as a\r\nsubstitute for the usual offering. After this date, the apple was\r\nconsidered as especially devoted to Hercules.\"\r\n\r\nIn ancient times, Greece produced most excellent apples. They were the\r\nfavorite dessert of Phillip of Macedon and Alexander the Great, the\r\nlatter causing them to be served at all meals. Doubtless they came to be\r\nused to excess; for it is recorded of the Athenian lawgiver, Solon, that\r\nhe made a decree prohibiting a bridegroom from partaking of more than\r\none at his marriage banquet, a law which was zealously kept by the\r\nGreeks, and finally adopted by the Persians. In Homer's time the apple\r\nwas regarded as one of the precious fruits. It was extensively\r\ncultivated by the Romans, who gave to new varieties the names of many\r\neminent citizens, and after the conquest of Gaul, introduced its culture\r\ninto Southwestern Europe, whence it has come to be widely diffused\r\nthroughout all parts of the temperate zone.\r\n\r\nApples were introduced into the United States by the early settlers,\r\nand the first trees were planted on an island in Boston Harbor, which\r\nstill retains the name of Apple Island. The wild crab tree is the parent\r\nof most of the cultivated varieties.\r\n\r\nTHE PEAR.--The origin of the pear, like that of the apple, is\r\nshrouded in obscurity, though Egypt, Greece, and Palestine dispute for\r\nthe honor of having given birth to the tree which bears this prince of\r\nfruits. Theophrastus, a Greek philosopher of the fourth century, speaks\r\nof the pear in terms of highest praise; and Galen, the father of medical\r\nscience, mentions the pear in his writings as possessing \"qualities\r\nwhich benefit the stomach.\" The pear tree is one of the most hardy of\r\nall fruit trees, and has been known to live several hundred years.\r\n\r\nTHE QUINCE.--This fruit appears to have been a native of Crete,\r\nfrom whence it was introduced into ancient Greece; and was largely\r\ncultivated by both Greeks and Romans. In Persia, the fruit is edible in\r\nits raw state; but in this country it never ripens sufficiently to be\r\npalatable without being cooked. The fruit is highly fragrant and\r\nexceedingly acid, and for these reasons it is largely employed to flavor\r\nother fruits.\r\n\r\nTHE PEACH.--This fruit, as its botanical name, _prinus Persica_,\r\nindicates, is a native of Persia, and was brought from that country to\r\nGreece, from whence it passed into Italy. It is frequently mentioned by\r\nancient writers, and was regarded with much esteem by the people of\r\nAsia. The Romans, however, had the singular notion that peaches gathered\r\nin Persia contained a deadly poison, but if once transplanted to another\r\nsoil, this injurious effect was lost. In composition, the peach is\r\nnotable for the small quantity of saccharine matter it contains in\r\ncomparison with other fruits.\r\n\r\nTHE PLUM.--The plum is one of the earliest of known fruits. Thebes,\r\nMemphis, and Damascus were noted for the great number of their plum\r\ntrees in the early centuries. Plum trees grow wild in Asia, America, and\r\nthe South of Europe, and from these a large variety of domestic plum\r\nfruits have been cultivated.\r\n\r\nPlums are more liable than most other fruits to produce disorders of\r\ndigestion, and when eaten raw should be carefully selected, that they be\r\nneither unripe nor unripe. Cooking renders them less objectionable.\r\n\r\nTHE PRUNE.--The plum when dried is often called by its French\r\ncognomen, _prune_. The larger and sweeter varieties are generally\r\nselected for drying, and when good and properly cooked, are the most\r\nwholesome of prepared fruits.\r\n\r\nTHE APRICOT.--This fruit seems to be intermediate between the peach\r\nand the plum, resembling the former externally, while the stone is like\r\nthat of the plum. The apricot originated in Armenia, and the tree which\r\nbears the fruit was termed by the Romans \"the tree of Armenia.\" It was\r\nintroduced into England in the time of Henry VIII. The apricot is\r\ncultivated to some extent in the United States, but it requires too much\r\ncare to permit of its being largely grown, except in certain sections.\r\n\r\nTHE CHERRY.--The common garden cherry is supposed to have been\r\nderived from the two species of wild fruit, and historians tell us that\r\nwe are indebted to the agricultural experiments of Mithridates, the\r\ngreat king of ancient Pontus, for this much esteemed fruit. It is a\r\nnative of Asia Minor, and its birthplace.\r\n\r\nTHE OLIVE.--From time immemorial the olive has been associated with\r\nhistory. The Scriptures make frequent reference to it, and its\r\ncultivation was considered of first importance among the Jews, who used\r\nits oil for culinary and a great variety of other purposes. Ancient\r\nmythology venerated the olive tree above all others, and invested it\r\nwith many charming bits of fiction. Grecian poets sang its praises, and\r\nearly Roman writers speak of it with high esteem. In appearance and size\r\nthe fruit is much like the plum; when ripe, it is very dark green,\r\nalmost black, and possesses a strong, and, to many people, disagreeable\r\nflavor. The pulp abounds in a bland oil, for the production of which it\r\nis extensively cultivated in Syria, Egypt, Italy, Spain, and Southern\r\nFrance. The fruit itself is also pickled and preserved in various ways,\r\nbut, like all other similar commodities when thus prepared, it is by no\r\nmeans a wholesome article of food.\r\n\r\nTHE DATE.--The date is the fruit of the palm tree so often\r\nmentioned in the Sacred Writings, and is indigenous to Africa and\r\nportions of Asia. The fruit grows in bunches which often weigh from\r\ntwenty to twenty-five pounds, and a single tree will bear from one to\r\nthree thousand pounds in a season. The date is very sweet and\r\nnutritious. It forms a stable article of diet for the inhabitants of\r\nsome parts of Egypt, Arabia, and Persia, and frequently forms the chief\r\nfood of their horses, dogs, and camels. The Arabs reduce dried dates to\r\na meal, and make therefrom a bread, which often constitutes their sole\r\nfood on long journeys through the Great Desert. The inhabitants of the\r\ncountries where the date tree flourishes, put its various productions to\r\ninnumerable uses. From its leaves they make baskets, bags, mats, combs,\r\nand brushes; from its stalks, fences for their gardens; from its fibers,\r\nthread, rope, and rigging; from its sap, a spirituous liquor; from its\r\nfruit, food for man and beast; while the body of the tree furnishes them\r\nwith fuel. The prepared fruit is largely imported to this country. That\r\nwhich is large, smooth, and of a soft reddish yellow tinge, with a\r\nwhitish membrane between the flesh and stone, is considered the best.\r\n\r\nTHE ORANGE.--According to some authors, the far-famed \"golden fruit\r\nof the Hesperides,\" which Hercules stole, was the orange; but it seems\r\nhighly improbable that it was known to writers of antiquity. It is\r\nsupposed to be indigenous to Central and Eastern Asia. Whatever its\r\nnativity, it has now spread over all the warmer regions of the earth.\r\nThe orange tree is very hardy in its own habitat, and is one of the most\r\nprolific of all fruit-bearing trees, a single tree having been known to\r\nproduce twenty thousand good oranges in a season. Orange trees attain\r\ngreat age. There are those in Italy and Spain which are known to have\r\nflourished for six hundred years. Numerous varieties of the orange are\r\ngrown, and are imported to our markets from every part of the globe.\r\nFlorida oranges are among the best, and when obtained in their\r\nperfection, are the most luscious of all fruits.\r\n\r\nTHE LEMON.--This fruit is supposed to be a native of the North of\r\nIndia, although it is grown in nearly all sub-tropical climates. In\r\ngeneral, the fruit is very acid, but in a variety known as the sweet\r\nlemon, or bergamot (said to be a hybrid of the orange and lemon), the\r\njuice is sweet. The sour lemon is highly valued for its antiscorbutic\r\nproperties, and is largely employed as a flavoring ingredient in\r\nculinary preparations, and in making a popular refreshing beverage.\r\n\r\nTHE CITRON.--The citron is a fruit very similar to the lemon,\r\nthough larger in size and less succulent. It is supposed to be identical\r\nwith the Hebrew _tappuach_, and to be the fruit which is mentioned in\r\nthe English version of the Old Testament as \"apple.\" The citron is not\r\nsuitable for eating in its raw state, though its juice is used in\r\nconnection with water and sugar to form an excellent acid drink. Its\r\nrind, which is very thick, with a warty and furrowed exterior, is\r\nprepared in sugar and largely used for flavoring purposes.\r\n\r\nTHE LIME.--The fruit of the lime is similar to the lemon, though\r\nmuch smaller in size. It is a native of Eastern Asia, but has long been\r\ncultivated in the South of Europe and other sub-tropical countries. The\r\nfruit is seldom used except for making acidulous drinks, for which it is\r\noften given the preference over the lemon.\r\n\r\nTHE GRAPE FRUIT.--This fruit, a variety of shaddock, belongs to the\r\ngreat _citrus_ family, of which there are one hundred and sixty-nine\r\nknown varieties. The shaddock proper, however, is a much larger fruit,\r\nfrequently weighing from ten to fourteen pounds. Although a certain\r\nquantity of grape fruit is brought from the West Indies, our principal\r\nsupply is derived from Florida. It is from two to four times the size of\r\nan ordinary orange, and grows in clusters. It is rapidly gaining in\r\nfavor with fruit lovers. Its juice has a moderately acid taste and makes\r\na pleasing beverage. The pulp, carefully separated, is also much\r\nesteemed.\r\n\r\nTHE POMEGRANATE.--This fruit has been cultivated in Asia from\r\nearliest antiquity, and is still quite generally grown in most tropical\r\nclimes. In the Scriptures it is mentioned with the vine, fig, and olive,\r\namong the pleasant fruits of the promised land. It is about the size of\r\na large peach, of a fine golden color, with a rosy tinge on one side.\r\nThe rind is thick and leathery. The central portion is composed of\r\nlittle globules of pulp and seeds inclosed in a thin membrane, each seed\r\nbeing about the size of a red currant. It is sub-acid, and slightly\r\nbitter in taste. The rind is strongly astringent, and often used as a\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nTHE GRAPE.--Undoubtedly the grape was one of the first fruits eaten\r\nby mankind, and one highly valued from antiquity down to the present\r\ntime. Although this fruit is often sadly perverted in the manufacture of\r\nwine, when rightly used it is one of the most excellent of all fruits.\r\nThe skins and seeds are indigestible and should be rejected, but the\r\nfresh, juicy pulp is particularly wholesome and refreshing. Several\r\nhundred varieties of the grape are cultivated. Some particularly sweet\r\nvarieties are made into raisins, by exposure to the sun or to artificial\r\nheat. Sun-dried grapes make the best raisins. The so-called English or\r\nZante currant belongs to the grape family, and is the dried fruit of a\r\nvine which grows in the Ionian Islands and yields a very small berry.\r\nThe name _currant_, as applied to these fruits, is a corruption of the\r\nword _Corinth_, where the fruit was formerly grown.\r\n\r\nTHE GOOSEBERRY.--The gooseberry probably derives its name from\r\ngorse or goss, a prickly shrub that grows wild in thickets and on\r\nhillsides in Europe, Asia, and America. It was known to the ancients,\r\nand is mentioned in the writings of Theocritus and Pliny. Gooseberries\r\nwere a favorite dish with some of the emperors, and were extensively\r\ncultivated in gardens during the Middle Ages. The gooseberry is a\r\nwholesome and agreeable fruit, and by cultivation may be brought to a\r\nhigh state of perfection in size and flavor.\r\n\r\nTHE CURRANT.--This fruit derives its name from its resemblance to\r\nthe small grapes of Corinth, sometimes called Corinthus, and is\r\nindigenous to America, Asia, and Europe. The fruit is sharply acid,\r\nthough very pleasant to the taste. Cultivation has produced white\r\ncurrants from the red, and in a distinct species of the fruit grown in\r\nNorthern Europe and Russia, the currants are black or yellow.\r\n\r\nTHE WHORTLEBERRY AND BLUEBERRY.--These are both species of the same\r\nfruit, which grows in woods and waste places in the North of Europe and\r\nAmerica. Of the latter species there are two varieties, the high-bush\r\nand the low-bush, which are equally palatable. The fruit is very sweet\r\nand pleasant to the taste, and is one of the most wholesome of all\r\nberries.\r\n\r\nTHE CRANBERRY.--A German writer of note insists that the original\r\nname of this fruit was cram-berry, because after dinner, when one was\r\nfilled with other food, such was its pleasant and seductive flavor that\r\nhe could still \"cram\" quite a quantity thereof, in defiance of all\r\ndietetic laws. Other writers consider the name a corruption of\r\ncraneberry, so called because it is eagerly sought after by the cranes\r\nand other birds which frequent the swamps and marshes where it chiefly\r\ngrows. The fruit is extremely acid, and is highly valued for sauces and\r\njellies. Cranberries are among the most convenient fruits for keeping.\r\nFreezing does not seem to hurt them, and they may be kept frozen all\r\nwinter, or in water without freezing, in the cellar, or other cool\r\nplaces, for a long period.\r\n\r\nTHE STRAWBERRY.--The flavor of antiquity rests upon the wild\r\nstrawberry. Its fruit was peddled by itinerant dealers about the streets\r\nof ancient Grecian and Roman cities. Virgil sings of it in pastoral\r\npoems, and Ovid mentions it in words of praise. The name by which the\r\nfruit was known to the Greeks indicates its size; with the Latins its\r\nname was symbolic of its perfume. The name _strawberry_ probably came\r\nfrom the old Saxon _streawberige_, either from some resemblance of the\r\nstems to straw, of from the fact that the berries have the appearance\r\nwhen growing of being strewn upon the ground. In olden times, children\r\nstrung the berries upon straws, and sold so many \"straws of berries\" for\r\na penny, from which fact it is possible the name may have been derived.\r\nThe strawberry is indigenous to the temperate regions of both the\r\nEastern and Western Hemispheres, but it seems to have been matured in\r\ngardens, only within the last two centuries.\r\n\r\nTHE RASPBERRY.--This fruit grows in both a wild and a cultivated\r\nstate. It derives its name from the rough rasps or spines with which the\r\nbushes are covered. Among the ancients it was called \"the bramble of Mt.\r\nIda,\" because it was abundant upon that mountain. It is a hardy fruit,\r\nfound in most parts of the world, and is of two special varieties, the\r\nblack and the red.\r\n\r\nTHE BLACKBERRY.--This fruit is a native of America and the greater\r\npart of Europe. There are one hundred and fifty-one named species,\r\nalthough the high-blackberry and the low-blackberry, or dewberry, are\r\nsaid to have furnished the best cultivated varieties.\r\n\r\nTHE MULBERRY.--Different varieties of the mulberry tree produce\r\nwhite, red, and black mulberries of fine aromatic flavor, and acidulous\r\nor sweet taste. Persia is supposed to be the native home of this fruit,\r\nfrom whence it was carried, at an early date, to Asia Minor and to\r\nGreece. The Hebrews were evidently well acquainted with it. It was also\r\ncultivated by the farmers of Attica and Peloponnesus. The ancient\r\nmulberry was considered the wisest and most prudent of trees, because it\r\ntook care not to put forth the smallest bud until the cold of winter had\r\ndisappeared, not to return. Then, however, it lost no time, but budded\r\nand blossomed in a day. Several varieties are found in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nTHE MELON.--This is the generic name for all the members of the\r\ngourd tribe known as cantaloupes, muskmelons, and watermelons. The fruit\r\nvaries greatly in size and color, and in the character of the rind. When\r\nfresh and perfectly ripe, melons are among the most delicious of edible\r\nfruits.\r\n\r\nTHE FIG.--In the most ancient histories, the fig tree is referred\r\nto as among the most desirable productions of the earth. It was the\r\nonly tree in the garden of Eden of which the Sacred Writings make\r\nparticular mention. Among the inhabitants of ancient Syria and Greece,\r\nit formed one of the principal articles of food. Its cultivation was,\r\nand is still, extensively carried on in nearly all Eastern countries;\r\nalso in Spain, Southern France, and some portions of the United States.\r\nThe fruit is pear-shaped, and consists of a pulpy mass full of little\r\nseeds. Dried and compressed figs are largely imported, and are to be\r\nfound in all markets. Those brought from Smyrna are reputed to be the\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nTHE BANANA.--This is essentially a tropical fruit growing very\r\ngenerally in the East, the West Indies, South American countries, and\r\nsome of the Southern States. The plant is an annual, sending up stems to\r\nthe height of ten or fifteen feet, while drooping from the top are\r\nenormous leaves three or four feet in length, and looking, as one writer\r\nhas aptly said, like \"great, green quill pens.\" It is planted in fields\r\nlike corn, which in its young growth it much resembles. Each plant\r\nproduces a single cluster of from eighty to one hundred or more bananas,\r\noften weighing in the aggregate as high as seventy pounds. The banana is\r\nexceedingly productive. According to Humboldt, a space of 1,000 feet,\r\nwhich will yield only 38 pounds of wheat, or 462 pounds of potatoes,\r\nwill produce 4,000 pounds of bananas, and in a much shorter period of\r\ntime. It is more nutritious than the majority of fruits, and in tropical\r\ncountries is highly valued as a food, affording in some localities the\r\nchief alimentary support of the people. Its great importance as a food\r\nproduct is shown by the fact that three or four good sized bananas are\r\nequal in nutritive value to a pound of bread. The amount of albumen\r\ncontained in a pound of bananas is about the same as that found in a\r\npound of rice, and the total nutritive value of one pound of bananas is\r\nonly a trifle less than that of an equal quantity of the best beefsteak.\r\n\r\nThe unripe fruit, which contains a considerable percentage of starch, is\r\noften dried in the oven and eaten as bread, which, in this state, it\r\nconsiderably resembles in taste and appearance. Thus prepared, it may be\r\nkept for a long time, and is very serviceable for use on long journeys.\r\nThe variety of the banana thus used is, however, a much larger kind\r\nthan any of those ordinarily found in our Northern markets, and is known\r\nas the plantain. The dried plantain, powdered, furnishes a meal of\r\nfragrant odor and bland taste, not unlike common wheat flour. It is said\r\nto be easy of digestion, and two pounds of the dry meal or six pounds of\r\nthe fruit is the daily allowance for a laborer in tropical America.\r\n\r\nTHE PINEAPPLE.--This delicious fruit is a native of South America,\r\nwhere it grows wild in the forests. It is cultivated largely in tropical\r\nAmerica, the West Indies, and some portions of Europe. The fruit grows\r\nsingly from the center of a small plant having fifteen or more long,\r\nnarrow, serrated, ridged, sharp-pointed leaves, seemingly growing from\r\nthe root. In general appearance it resembles the century plant, though\r\nso much smaller that twelve thousand pineapple plants may be grown on\r\none acre. From the fibers of the leaves is made a costly and valuable\r\nfabric called _pina_ muslin.\r\n\r\nNothing can surpass the rich, delicate flavor of the wild pineapple as\r\nfound in its native habitat. It is in every way quite equal to the best\r\ncultivated variety. The most excellent pineapples are imported from the\r\nWest Indies, but are seldom found in perfection in out Northern markets.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRESH FRUIT FOR THE TABLE.\r\n\r\nAll fruit for serving should be perfectly ripe and sound. Immature fruit\r\nis never wholesome, and owing to the large percentage of water in its\r\ncomposition, fruit is very prone to change; hence over-ripe fruit should\r\nnot be eaten, as it is liable to ferment and decompose in the digestive\r\ntract.\r\n\r\nFruit which has begun, however slightly, to decay, should be rejected.\r\nJuice circulates through its tissues in much the same manner as the\r\nblood circulates through animal tissues, though not so rapidly and\r\nfreely. The circulation is sufficient, however, to convey to all parts\r\nthe products of decomposition, when only a small portion has undergone\r\ndecay, and although serious results do not always follow the use of\r\nsuch fruit, it certainly is not first-class food.\r\n\r\nIf intended to be eaten raw, fruit should be well ripened before\r\ngathering, and should be perfectly fresh. Fruit that has stood day after\r\nday in a dish upon the table, in a warm room, is far less wholesome and\r\ntempting than that brought fresh from the storeroom or cellar. All\r\nfruits should be thoroughly cleansed before serving. Such fruit as\r\ncherries, grapes, and currants may be best washed by placing in a\r\ncolander, and dipping in and out of a pan of water until perfectly\r\nclean, draining and drying before serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n_DIRECTIONS FOR SERVING FRUITS._\r\n\r\nAPPLES.--In serving these, the \"queen of all fruits,\" much\r\nopportunity is afforded for a display of taste in their arrangement.\r\nAfter wiping clean with a damp towel, they may be piled in a fruit\r\nbasket, with a few sprigs of green leaves here and there between their\r\nrosy cheeks. The feathery tops of carrots and celery are pretty for this\r\npurpose. Oranges and apples so arranged, make a highly ornamental dish.\r\n\r\nRaw mellow sweet apples make a delicious dish when pared, sliced, and\r\nserved with cream.\r\n\r\nBANANAS.--Cut the ends from the fruit and serve whole, piled in a\r\nbasket with oranges, grapes, or plums. Another way is to peel, slice,\r\nand serve with thin cream. Bananas are also very nice sliced, sprinkled\r\nlightly with sugar, and before it had quite dissolved, covered with\r\norange juice. Sliced bananas, lightly sprinkled with sugar, alternating\r\nin layers with sections of oranges, make a most delicious dessert.\r\n\r\nCHERRIES.--Serve on stems, piled in a basket or high dish, with\r\nbits of green leaves and vines between. Rows of different colored\r\ncherries, arranged in pyramidal form, make also a handsome dish.\r\n\r\nCURRANTS.--Large whole clusters may be served on the stem, and when\r\nit is possible to obtain both red and white varieties, they make a most\r\nattractive dish. Put them into cold water for a little time, cool\r\nthoroughly, and drain well before using. Currants, if picked from the\r\nstems after being carefully washed and drained, may be served lightly\r\nsprinkled with sugar. Currants and raspberries served together, half and\r\nhalf, or one third currants two thirds raspberries, are excellent. Only\r\nthe ripest of currants should be used.\r\n\r\nGOOSEBERRIES.--When fresh and ripe, the gooseberry is one of the\r\nmost delicious of small fruits. Serve with stems on. Drop into cold\r\nwater for a few moments, drain, and pile in a glass dish for the table.\r\n\r\nGRAPES.--Grapes need always to be washed before serving. Drop the\r\nbunches into ice water, let them remain ten of fifteen minutes, then\r\ndrain and serve. An attractive dish may be made by arranging bunches of\r\ndifferent colored grapes together on a plate edged with grape leaves.\r\n\r\nMELONS.--Watermelons should be served very cold. After being well\r\nwashed on the outside, put on ice until needed. Cut off a slice at the\r\nends, that each half may stand upright on a plate, and then cut around\r\nin even slices. Instead of cutting through the center into even halves,\r\nthe melon may be cut in points back and forth around the entire\r\ncircumference, so that when separated, each half will appear like a\r\ncrown. Another way is to take out the central portion with a spoon, in\r\ncone-shaped pieces, and arrange on a plate with a few bits of ice. Other\r\nmelons may be served in halves, with the seeds removed. The rough skin\r\nof the cantaloupe should be thoroughly scrubbed with a vegetable brush,\r\nthen rinsed and wiped, after which bury the melon in broken ice till\r\nserving time; divide into eighths or sixteenths, remove the seeds,\r\nreconstruct the melon, and serve surrounded with ice, on a folded\r\nnapkin, or arranged on a bed of grape leaves. Do not cool the melon by\r\nplacing ice upon the flesh, as the moisture injures the delicate flavor.\r\n\r\nORANGES.--Serve whole or cut the skin into eighths, halfway down,\r\nseparating it from the fruit, and curling it inward, thus showing half\r\nthe orange white and the other half yellow; or cut the skin into\r\neighths, two-thirds down, and after loosening from the fruit, leave them\r\nspread open like the petals of a lily. Oranges sliced and mixed with\r\nwell ripened strawberries, in the proportion of three oranges to a quart\r\nof berries, make--a palatable dessert.\r\n\r\nPEACHES AND PEARS.--Pick out the finest, and wipe the wool from the\r\npeaches. Edge a plate with uniform sized leaves of foliage plant of the\r\nsame tints as the fruit, and pile the fruit artistically upon it,\r\ntucking sprays or tips of the plant between. Bits of ice may also be\r\nintermingled. Yellow Bartlett pears and rosy-cheeked peaches arranged in\r\nthis way are most ornamental.\r\n\r\nPEACHES AND CREAM.--Pare the peaches just as late as practicable,\r\nsince they become discolored by standing. Always use a silver knife, as\r\nsteel soon blackens and discolors the fruit. If sugar is to be used, do\r\nnot add it until the time for serving, as it will start the juice, and\r\nlikewise turn the fruit brown, destroying much of its rich flavor. Keep\r\non ice until needed for the table. Add cream with each person's dish.\r\n\r\nPINEAPPLES.--The pineapple when fresh and ripened to perfection, is\r\nas mellow and juicy as a ripe peach, and needs no cooking to fit it for\r\nthe table. Of course it must be pared, and have the eyes and fibrous\r\ncenter removed. Then it may be sliced in generous pieces and piled upon\r\na plate, or cut into smaller portions and served in saucers. No\r\ncondiments are necessary; even the use of sugar detracts from its\r\ndelicate flavor. Pineapples found in our Northern markets are, however,\r\ngenerally so hard and tough as to require cooking, or are valuable only\r\nfor their juice, which may be extracted and used for flavoring other\r\nfruits. When sufficiently mellow to be eaten raw, they are usually so\r\ntart as to seem to require a light sprinkling of sugar to suit most\r\ntastes. Pineapples pared, cut into dice or small pieces, lightly\r\nsprinkled with sugar, to which just before serving, a cup of orange\r\njuice is added, form a delicious dish.\r\n\r\nPLUMS.--Plums make a most artistic fruit piece, served whole and\r\narranged with bunches of choice green grapes, in a basket or glass dish.\r\nA fine edge may be made from the velvety leaves of dark purple foliage\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nPRESSED FIGS.--Look over carefully, and select only such as are\r\nperfectly good. They may be served dry, mixed with bunches of raisins,\r\nor steamed over a kettle of boiling water. Steamed figs make an\r\nexcellent breakfast dish, and are considered much more wholesome then\r\nwhen used dry. Steamed raisins are likewise superior to dried raisins.\r\n\r\nRASPBERRIES, BLACKBERRIES, DEWBERRIES, BLUEBERRIES AND WHORTLEBERRIES,\r\nrequire careful looking over to remove all insects, stems, and over-ripe\r\nfruit. Blueberries and whortleberries frequently need to be washed. They\r\nare then drained by spreading on a sieve or colander. Perfectly ripe,\r\nthey are more healthful without condiments; but sugar and cream are\r\nusually considered indispensable.\r\n\r\nIf necessary to wash strawberries, they should be put into cold water, a\r\nfew at a time, pushed down lightly beneath the water several times until\r\nentirely clean, then taken out one by one, hulled, and used at once.\r\nLike all other small fruits and berries they are more wholesome served\r\nwithout cream, but if cream is used, each person should be allowed to\r\nadd it to his own dish, as it quickly curdles and renders the whole dish\r\nunsightly; if allowed to stand, it also impairs the flavor of the fruit.\r\n\r\nFROSTED FRUIT.--Prepare a mixture of the beaten white of egg,\r\nsugar, and a very little cold water. Dip nice bunches of clean currants,\r\ncherries, or grapes into the mixture; drain nearly dry, and roll lightly\r\nin powdered sugar. Lay them on white paper to dry. Plums, apricots, and\r\npeaches may be dipped in the mixture, gently sprinkled with sugar, then\r\nallowed to dry. This method of preparing fruit is not to be commended\r\nfor its wholesomeness, but it is sometimes desirable for ornament.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEEPING FRESH FRUIT.\r\n\r\nOf the numerous varieties of fruits grown in this country, apples and\r\npears are about the only ones that can be kept for any length of time\r\nwithout artificial means. As soon as fruit has attained its maturity, a\r\ngradual change or breaking down of tissues begins. In some fruits this\r\nprocess follows rapidly; in other it is gradual. There is a certain\r\npoint at which the fruits are best suited for use. We call it\r\nmellowness, and say that the fruit is in \"good eating condition.\" When\r\nthis stage has been reached, deterioration and rotting soon follow. In\r\nsome fruits, as the peach, plum, and early varieties of apples and\r\npears, these changes occur within a few days after maturity, and it is\r\nquite useless to attempt to keep them; in others, like the later\r\nvarieties of apples and pears, the changes are slow but none the less\r\ncertain. To keep such fruits we must endeavor to retard or prolong the\r\nprocess of change, by avoiding all conditions likely to hasten decay.\r\nEven with ordinary care, sound fruit will keep for quite a length of\r\ntime; but it can be preserved in better condition and for a longer\r\nperiod by careful attention to the following practical points:--\r\n\r\n1. If the fruit is of a late variety, allow it to remain on the tree as\r\nlong as practicable without freezing.\r\n\r\n2. Always pick and handle the fruit with the greatest care.\r\n\r\n3. Gather the fruit on a dry, cool day, and place in heaps or bins for\r\ntwo or three weeks.\r\n\r\n4. Carefully sort and pack in barrels, placing those most mellow and\r\nthose of different varieties in different barrels; head the barrels,\r\nlabel, and place in a cool, dry place where the temperature will remain\r\nequable. Some consider it better to keep fruit in thin layers upon broad\r\nshelves in a cool place. This plan allows frequent inspection and\r\nremoval of all affected fruit without disturbance of the remainder.\r\n\r\n5. Warmth and moisture are the conditions most favorable to\r\ndecomposition, and should be especially guarded against.\r\n\r\n6. The best temperature for keeping fruit is about 34° F., or 2° above\r\nfreezing.\r\n\r\nAnother method which is highly recommended is to sprinkle a layer of\r\nsawdust on the bottom of a box, and then put in a layer of apples, not\r\nallowing them to tough each other. Upon this pack more sawdust; then\r\nanother layer of apples, and so on until the box is filled. After\r\npacking, place up from the ground, in a cellar or storeroom, and they\r\nwill keep perfectly, retaining their freshness and flavor until brought\r\nout. The _Practical Farmer_ gives the following rough but good way to\r\nstore and keep apples: \"Spread plenty of buckwheat chaff on the barn\r\nfloor, and on this place the apples, filling the interstices with the\r\nchaff. Cover with the chaff and then with straw two or three feet deep.\r\nThe advantage of this is that covering and bedding in chaff excludes\r\ncold, prevents air currents, maintains a uniform temperature, absorbs\r\nthe moisture of decay, and prevents the decay produced by moisture.\"\r\n\r\nThe ordinary cellar underneath the dwelling house is too warm and damp\r\nfor the proper preservation of fruit, and some other place should be\r\nprovided if possible. A writer in the _American Agriculturist_ thus\r\ncalls attention to an additional reason why fruit should not be stored\r\nbeneath living-rooms: \"After late apples are stored for the winter, a\r\ngradual change begins within the fruit. It absorbs oxygen from the air\r\nof the room, and gives off carbonic acid gas. Another change results in\r\nthe formation of water, which is given off as moisture. The taking up of\r\noxygen by the fruit and the giving off of carbonic acid, in a short time\r\nso vitiates the atmosphere of the room in which the fruit is kept, that\r\nit will at once extinguish a candle, and destroy animal life. An\r\natmosphere of this kind tends to preserve the fruit. There being little\r\nor no oxygen left in the air of the room, the process of decay is\r\narrested. Hence it is desirable that the room be air tight, in order to\r\nmaintain such an atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\nThe production of carbonic acid shows that a cellar in or under a\r\ndwelling, is an improper place for storing fresh fruit. When the gas is\r\npresent in the air in sufficient proportion, it causes death, and a very\r\nsmall quantity will cause headache, listlessness, and other unpleasant\r\neffects. No doubt many troubles attributed to malaria, are due to gases\r\nfrom vegetables and fruits stored in the cellar. A fruit cellar should\r\nbe underneath some other building rather than the dwelling, or a fruit\r\nhouse may be built entirely above the ground. A house to keep fruit\r\nproperly must be built upon the principle of a refrigerator. Its walls,\r\nfloor, and ceiling should be double, and the space between filled with\r\nsawdust. The doors and windows should be double; and as light is\r\nundesirable, the windows should be provided with shutters. There should\r\nbe a small stove for use if needed to keep a proper temperature in\r\nsevere weather.\r\n\r\nTO KEEP GRAPES.--Select such bunches as are perfect, rejecting all\r\nupon which there are any bruised grapes, or from which a grape has\r\nfallen. Spread them upon shelves in a cool place for a week or two. Then\r\npack in boxes in sawdust which has been recently well dried in an oven.\r\nBran which has been dried may also be used. Dry cotton is employed by\r\nsome. Keep in a cool place.\r\n\r\nSome consider the following a more efficient method: select perfect\r\nbunches, and dip the broken end of the stems in melted paraffine or\r\nsealing wax. Wrap separately in tissue paper, hang in a cool place, or\r\npack in sawdust.\r\n\r\nTO KEEP LEMONS AND ORANGES.--Lemons may be kept fresh for weeks by\r\nplacing them in a vessel of cold water in a very cool cellar or ice\r\nhouse. Change the water every day. Oranges may be kept in the same way.\r\nThe usual method employed by growers for keeping these fruits is to wrap\r\neach one separately in tissue paper, and put in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nTO KEEP CRANBERRIES.--Put them in water and keep in a cool place\r\nwhere they will not freeze. Change the water often, and sort out berries\r\nwhich may have become spoiled.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOOKED FRUIT.\r\n\r\nPerfectly ripe fruit is, as a rule, more desirable used fresh than in\r\nany other way. Fruits which are immature, require cooking. Stewing and\r\nbaking are the simplest methods of preparation.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SUGGESTIONS FOR COOKING FRUIT.--The utensils for stewing\r\nshould be porcelain-lined, or granite ware. Fruit cooked in tin loses\r\nmuch of its delicate flavor; while if it be acid, and the tin of poor\r\nquality, there is always danger that the acid of the fruit acting upon\r\nthe metal will form a poisonous compound. Cover with a china plate or\r\ngranite-ware cover, never with a tin one, as the steam will condense and\r\nrun down into the kettle, discoloring the contents. Use only silver\r\nknives for preparing the fruit, and silver or wooden spoons for\r\nstirring. Prepare just before cooking, if you would preserve the fruit\r\nperfect in flavor, and unimpaired by discoloration. In preparing apples,\r\npears, and quinces for stewing, it is better to divide the fruit into\r\nhalves or quarters before paring. The fruit is more easily handled, can\r\nbe pared thinner and cored more quickly. Peaches, apricots, and plums,\r\nif divided and stoned before paring, can be much more easily kept whole.\r\n\r\nCook in a small quantity of boiling water, and if economy is a point to\r\nbe considered, do not add sugar until the fruit is done. Sugar boiled\r\nwith an acid will be converted into glucose, two and one half pounds of\r\nwhich only equal one pound of cane sugar in sweetening properties. It\r\nwill require a much larger amount of sugar to sweeten fruit if added\r\nbefore the cooking process is completed. Fruit should be cooked by\r\nstewing, or by gentle simmering; hard boiling will destroy the fine\r\nflavor of all fruits, and especially of berries and other small fruits.\r\nCinnamon, cloves, or other spices, should not be added, as their\r\nstronger flavors deaden or obliterate the natural flavor, which should\r\nalways be preserved as perfectly as possible. If desirable to add some\r\nforeign flavor, let it be the flavor of another fruit, or the perfume\r\nof flowers. For Instance, flavor apple with lemon, pineapple, quince, or\r\nrose water.\r\n\r\nUnripe fruit is improved by making the cooking quite lengthy, which acts\r\nin the place of the ripening process, changing the starchy matter to\r\nsaccharine elements. In cooking fruit, try to preserve its natural form.\r\nThe more nearly whole it is, the better it looks, and the more natural\r\nwill be its flavor.\r\n\r\nApples are best cooked by baking. Pears and quinces are also excellent\r\nbaked. The oven should be only moderately hot; if the heat is too great,\r\nthey brown on the outside before they are done throughout. In cooking\r\nfruit by any method, pains should be taken to cook together such as are\r\nof the same variety, size, and degree of hardness; if it is to be cut in\r\npieces, care should be taken to have the pieces of uniform size.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nBAKED APPLES.--Moderately tart apples or very juicy sweet ones are\r\nbest for baking. Select ripe apples, free from imperfections, and of\r\nnearly equal size. Wipe carefully and remove the blossom ends. Water\r\nsufficient to cover bottom of the baking dish, should be added if the\r\nfruit is not very juicy. If the apples are sour and quite firm, a good\r\nway is to pare them before baking, and then place them in an earthen pie\r\ndish with a little hot water. If they incline to brown too quickly,\r\ncover the tops with a granite-ware pie dish. If the syrup dries out, add\r\na little more hot water. When done, set them away till nearly cold, then\r\ntransfer to a glass dish, pour the syrup, which should be thick and\r\namber colored, over them. Sour apples are excellent pared, cored, and\r\nbaked with the centers filled with sugar, jelly, or a mixture or chopped\r\nraisins and dates. They should be put into a shallow earthen dish with\r\nwater sufficient to cover the bottom, and baked in a quick oven, basting\r\noften with the syrup. Sweet apples are best baked without paring. Baked\r\napples are usually served as a relish, but with a dressing of cream they\r\nmake a most delicious dessert.\r\n\r\nCITRON APPLES.--Select a few tart apples of the same degree of\r\nhardness, and remove the cores. Unless the skins are very tender, it is\r\nbetter to pare them. Fill the cavities with sugar, first placing in each\r\napple a few bits of chopped citron. If the skins have been removed,\r\nplace the stuffed apples on a flat earthen dish with a tablespoonful of\r\nwater on the bottom; cover closely, and bake till perfectly tender, but\r\nnot till they have fallen to pieces. If the skins are left on, they may\r\nbe baked without covering. When cold, serve in separate dishes, with or\r\nwithout a spoonful or two of whipped cream on each apple.\r\n\r\nLEMON APPLES.--Prepare tart apples the same as for citron apples.\r\nFill the cavities made by removing the cores with a mixture of grated\r\nlemon and sugar, squeeze a few drops of lemon juice over each apple, and\r\nbake. Serve with or without whipped cream.\r\n\r\nBAKED PEARS.--Hard pears make an excellent dessert when baked.\r\nPare, halve, remove seeds, and place in a shallow earthen dish, with a\r\ncup of water to each two quarts of fruit. If the pears are sour, a\r\nlittle sugar may be added. Bake, closely covered, in a moderate oven\r\nuntil tender. Serve with sugar and cream. Tart pears are the best for\r\nbaking, as the sweet varieties are often tasteless.\r\n\r\nBAKED QUINCES.--Pare and remove the cores. Fill the cavities with\r\nsugar, put in a shallow earthen dish, and add water to cover the bottom;\r\nbake till soft, basting often with the syrup. If the syrup dries out\r\nbefore the fruit is perfectly tender, add a little more hot water.\r\n\r\nPIPPINS AND QUINCE.--Pare and quarter nice golden pippins, and cook\r\nin boiling water until reduced to a jelly. Add two or three quinces\r\nsliced, and simmer slowly in the jelly until the quince is tender. Add\r\nsugar to taste. Serve cold.\r\n\r\nBAKED APPLE SAUCE.--Pare, core, and quarter apples to fill an\r\nearthen crock or deep pudding dish, taking care to use apples of the\r\nsame degree of hardness, and pieces of the same size. For two quarts of\r\nfruit thus prepared, add a cup of water, and if the apples are sour, a\r\ncup of sugar. Cover closely, and bake in a moderate oven several hours,\r\nor until of a dark red color.\r\n\r\nSweet apples and quinces in the proportion of two parts of apple to one\r\nof quince, baked in this way, are also good. Cut the apples into\r\nquarters, but slice the quinces much thinner, as they are more difficult\r\nto cook. Put a layer of quince on the bottom of the dish, alternating\r\nwith a layer of apple, until the dish is full. Add cold water to half\r\ncover the fruit, and stew in the oven well covered, without stirring,\r\nuntil tender.\r\n\r\nPears may be cooked in a similar way, and both apples and pears thus\r\ncooked may be canned while hot and kept for a long period.\r\n\r\nBAKED APPLE SAUCE NO. 2.--Prepare nice tart apples as for No. 1.\r\nBake, with a small quantity of water, in a covered pudding dish, in a\r\nmoderate oven, until soft. Mash with a spoon, add sugar, and when cold,\r\na little grated orange rind.\r\n\r\nAPPLES STEWED WHOLE.--Take six large red apples, wash carefully,\r\nand put in a fruit kettle with just enough boiling water to cover. Cover\r\nthe kettle, and cook slowly until the apples are soft, with the skins\r\nbroken and the juice a rich red color. After removing the apples, boil\r\nthe juice to a syrup, sweeten, and pour over the apples.\r\n\r\nSTEAMED APPLES.--Select pound sweets of uniform size, wipe, cut\r\nout the blossom-ends, and pack in a large pudding dish. Pour in a cupful\r\nof water, cover the dish closely, set in a moderate oven, and steam till\r\nthe apples are tender. Remove from the dish, and pour the liquor over\r\nthem frequently as they cool.\r\n\r\nCOMPOTE OF APPLES.--Pare and extract the cores from moderately\r\ntart, juicy apples. Place them in a deep pudding dish with just enough\r\nwater to cover them. Cover, place in a moderate oven, and stew until\r\nthey are tender. Remove the apples and place in a deep dish to keep hot.\r\nMeasure the juice and pour it into a saucepan, add a few bits of lemon\r\nrind, and boil up until thickened almost like a jelly. While the juice\r\nis boiling, heat some sugar, one tablespoonful to each cup of juice, in\r\nthe oven, and add to the juice when thickened. Pour scalding hot over\r\nthe apples, and cover until cold.\r\n\r\nAPPLE COMPOTE NO. 2.--Pare eight or ten rather tart, finely\r\nflavored and easy-cooking apples, carefully removing the cores, and put\r\nthem into a broad, shallow, granite-ware saucepan with just enough hot\r\nwater to cover the bottom. Cover tightly and place over the fire. The\r\nsteam will cook the apples tender in a short time. Do not allow them to\r\nfall to pieces. Make a syrup by dissolving one cup of sugar in a pint of\r\nhot water. Add three teaspoonfuls of the juice of canned pineapple, and\r\npour over the apples while both are hot.\r\n\r\nSTEWED PEARS.--Select some fine Bartlett pears which are ripe, but\r\nhave hardly begun to soften; remove the skins, cut in halves or\r\nquarters, and take out the seeds. Put loosely in a granite-ware kettle,\r\nand add a pint of water for three and a half quarts of fruit. Cover\r\nclosely, and when it begins to boil, set it where it will just simmer\r\nuntil the top pieces are tender. Serve cold. Sugar will not be necessary\r\nif the fruit is of good quality.\r\n\r\nSMOOTH APPLE SAUCE.--If fruit is not sufficiently perfect to be cut\r\ninto uniform quarters, a good way to prepare it is to pare, core, and\r\nslice into thin slices. Cook in as small a quantity of water as\r\npossible, the fruit covered closely, so that the top portion will steam\r\ntender as soon as the bottom, and when done rub through a colander, or\r\nbeat smooth with a wooden spoon or an egg beater. Let it cool before\r\nadding sugar. A little lemon peel may be added to the fruit just long\r\nenough before it is done to flavor it, if desired.\r\n\r\nBOILED APPLES WITH SYRUP.--Halve and remove the cores of a half\r\ndozen nice apples, leaving the skins on. Boil till tender in sufficient\r\nwater to cover them. Take out with a fork into a glass dish. Add to the\r\njuice three or four slices of a large lemon; boil for ten or fifteen\r\nminutes; sweeten to taste; then pour over the apples, and cool.\r\n\r\nSTEWED APPLES.--Select fine fruit of a sub-acid flavor and not\r\nover-ripe. Pare, remove the cores and all blemishes, and divide into\r\nsixths if large, into quarters if small. Put into a porcelain or\r\ngranite-ware kettle with enough boiling water to cook and leave a good\r\nliquor. Cover, and simmer gently, without stirring, from one to two\r\nhours. Do not add sugar till cold. Be careful not to break the fruit in\r\nserving.\r\n\r\nSTEWED CRAB APPLES.--Select perfect fruit. Wash and stew in but\r\nlittle water until they are very soft. Rub through a coarse sieve or\r\ncolander to remove the seeds and skins. Sweeten to taste.\r\n\r\nSWEET APPLE SAUCE WITH CONDENSED APPLE JUICE.--For the juice, wash,\r\ndivide, and core rather tart apples and cook until softened with one cup\r\nof water for every six pounds of fruit. When soft, put into a percolater\r\nand drain off the juice or extract it with a fruit press. Boil until it\r\nis reduced one half. Skim if needed while boiling, and if not perfectly\r\nclear allow it to settle before using. A considerable quantity of the\r\njuice may be thus prepared and put into stone jars, to be used as\r\nneeded. For the sauce, pare, core, and quarter sweet apples. Put into a\r\nporcelain kettle with enough of the condensed juice to cover. Cook\r\nslowly until tender.\r\n\r\nAPPLES WITH RAISINS.--Pare, core, and quarter a dozen or more\r\nmedium sized sour apples. Clean thoroughly one fourth as many raisins as\r\napples, and turn over them a quart of boiling water. Let them steep\r\nuntil well swollen, then add the apples, and cook until tender. Sugar to\r\nsweeten may be added if desired, although little will be needed unless\r\nthe apples are very tart. Dried apples soaked over night may be made\r\nmuch more palatable by stewing with raisins or English currants, in the\r\nsame way.\r\n\r\nAPPLES WITH APRICOTS.--Pare, core, and quarter some nice, sour\r\napples. Put them to cook with two halves of dried apricot for each\r\napple. When tender, make smooth by beating or rubbing through a\r\ncolander, and sweeten. Dried apples may be used in place of fresh ones.\r\n\r\nPEACHES, PLUMS, CHERRIES, BERRIES, and all small fruits may be\r\ncooked for sauce by stewing in a small amount of water, adding sugar to\r\nsweeten when done.\r\n\r\nBAKED APPLES.--Take any good tart apples; peel, cut in halves, and\r\nremove the cores. Scatter a few spoonfuls of sugar in the bottom of a\r\ndish, and lay the apples in, flat side down; add a teacupful of cold\r\nwater, and bake till tender. Let stand in the dish till cold, then take\r\nup the pieces in a vegetable dish, and poor over them what juice\r\nremains. Sweet apples are good baked in this way without sugar.\r\n\r\nBAKED PEARS.--Peel ripe pears; cut in halves, and pack in layers in\r\na stone ware jar. Strew a little sugar over each layer, and add a small\r\ncupful of water, to prevent burning. Cover tightly, and bake three or\r\nfour hours in a well-heated oven. Let them get very cold, and serve\r\nwith sweet cream.\r\n\r\nBAKED PEACHES.--Peaches which are ripe but too hard for eating, are\r\nnice baked. Pare, remove the stones, and place in loose layers in a\r\nshallow, earthen pudding dish with a little water. Sprinkle each layer\r\nlightly with sugar, cover and bake.\r\n\r\nCRANBERRIES.--Cranberries make an excellent sauce, but the skins\r\nare rather hard of digestion, and it is best to exclude them. Stew in\r\nthe proportion of a quart of berries to a pint of water, simmering\r\ngently until the skins have all burst, and the quantity is reduced to a\r\npint. Put through a colander to remove the skins, and when nearly cool,\r\nadd for the quart of berries two thirds of a cup of sugar.\r\n\r\nCRANBERRIES WITH RAISINS.--Cook the cranberries as in the preceding\r\nrecipe, and when rubbed through the colander, add for every pound of\r\ncranberries before cooking, one fourth pound of raisins which have been\r\nsteeped for half an hour in just sufficient boiling water to cover. A\r\nlittle less sugar will be needed to sweeten than when served without the\r\nraisins.\r\n\r\nCRANBERRIES AND SWEET APPLES.--Stew equal parts of cranberries and\r\nsweet apples together. Mash, rub through a fine sieve or colander to\r\nremove the skins and make the whole homogeneous. This makes a very\r\npalatable sauce without the addition of sugar. California prunes and\r\ncranberries stewed together in equal proportion, in a small quantity of\r\nwater, also make a nice sauce without sugar.\r\n\r\nORANGES AND APPLES.--The mild, easy cooking, tart varieties of\r\napples make an excellent sauce stewed with one third sliced oranges from\r\nwhich the seeds have been removed. Pare, core, and slice the apples, and\r\ncook gently so as to preserve the form of both fruits until the apples\r\nare tender. Add sugar to sweeten, and if desired a very little of the\r\ngrated yellow of the orange rind.\r\n\r\nSTEWED RAISINS.--Soak a pint of good raisins, cleaned and freed\r\nfrom stems, in cold water for several hours. When ready to cook, put\r\nthem, with the water in which they were soaked, in a fruit kettle and\r\nsimmer until the skins are tender. Three or four good-sized figs,\r\nchopped quite fine, cooked with the raisins, gives an additional\r\nrichness and thickness of juice. No sugar will be needed.\r\n\r\nDRIED APPLES.--Good apples properly dried make a very palatable\r\nsauce; but unfortunately the fruit generally selected for drying is of\r\nso inferior a quality that if cooked in its fresh state it would not be\r\ngood. The dried fruit in most of our markets needs to be looked over\r\ncarefully, and thoroughly washed before using. Put into a granite-ware\r\nkettle, cover with boiling water, and cook gently until tender. Fresh\r\nsteam-dried or evaporated apples will cook in from one half to three\r\nfourths of an hour; if older, they may require from one to two more\r\nhours. Add boiling water, as needed, during the cooking. If when tender\r\nthey are lacking in juice, add a little boiling water long enough before\r\nlifting from the fire to allow it to boil up once. If the fruit is very\r\npoor, a few very thin slices of the yellow portion of lemon or orange\r\nrind added a half hour before it is done, will sometimes be an\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nDRIED APPLES WITH OTHER DRIED FRUIT.--An excellent sauce may be\r\nmade by cooking a few dried plums with dried or evaporated apples. Only\r\nenough of the plums to give a flavor to the apples will be needed; a\r\nhandful of the former to a pound of apples will be sufficient. Dried\r\ncherries, raisins, English currants, dried apricots, prunelles, and\r\npeaches are also excellent used in combination with dried apples.\r\n\r\nDRIED APRICOTS AND PEACHES.--These fruits, if dried with the skins\r\non, need, in addition to the preparation for cooking recommended for\r\ndried apples, a thorough rubbing with the fingers, while being washed,\r\nto remove the down. Put into boiling water in about the proportion of\r\ntwo parts of fruit to three of water. If the fruit was pared before\r\ndrying, a little more water will be required. Cook quickly, but gently,\r\nuntil just tender, and take from the fire as soon as done. If too soft,\r\nthey will be mushy and insipid.\r\n\r\nEVAPORATED PEACH SAUCE.--Soak the peaches over night in just enough\r\nwater to cover. In the morning put to cook in boiling water. When\r\ntender, sweeten and beat perfectly smooth with an egg beater.\r\n\r\nDRIED PEARS.--These may be treated in the same way as dried apples.\r\n\r\nSMALL FRUITS.--These when dried must be carefully examined,\r\nthoroughly washed, and then cooked rather quickly in boiling water. They\r\nswell but little, do not require much water, and usually cook in a few\r\nminutes. They should be taken from the fire as soon as soft, as long\r\nstanding makes them insipid.\r\n\r\nPRUNES.--Use only the best selected prunes. Clean by putting them\r\ninto warm water; let them stand a few minutes, rubbing them gently\r\nbetween the hands to make sure that all dust and dirt is removed; rinse,\r\nand if rather dry and hard, put them into three parts of water to one of\r\nprunes; cover closely, and let them simmer for several hours. If the\r\nprunes are quite easily cooked, less water may be used. They will be\r\ntender, with a thick juice. The sweet varieties need no sugar whatever.\r\nMany persons who cannot eat fruit cooked with sugar, can safely partake\r\nof sweet prunes cooked in this way. A slice of lemon added just before\r\nthe prunes are done, is thought an improvement.\r\n\r\nPRUNE MARMALADE.--Cook sweet California prunes as directed above.\r\nWhen well done, rub through a colander to remove the skins and stones.\r\nNo sugar is necessary. If the pulp is too thin when cold, it may be\r\ncovered in an earthen pudding dish and stewed down by placing in a pan\r\nof hot water in a moderate oven.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESERVATION OF FRUIT.\r\n\r\nFresh fruit is so desirable, while at the same time the season during\r\nwhich most varieties can be obtained is so transient, that various\r\nmethods are resorted to for preserving it in as nearly a natural state\r\nas possible. The old-fashioned plans of pickling in salt, alcohol, or\r\nvinegar, or preserving in equal quantities of sugar, are eminently\r\nunhygienic. Quite as much to be condemned is the more modern process of\r\nkeeping fruit by adding to it some preserving agent, like salicylic acid\r\nor other chemicals. Salicylic acid is an antiseptic, and like many other\r\nsubstances, such as carbolic acid, creosote, etc., has the power of\r\npreventing the decay of organic substances. Salicylic acid holds the\r\npreference over other drugs of this class, because it imparts no\r\nunpleasant flavor to the fruit. It is nevertheless a powerful and\r\nirritating drug, and when taken, even in small doses, produces intense\r\nburning in the stomach, and occasions serious disturbances of the heart\r\nand other organs. Its habitual use produces grave diseases.\r\n\r\nWhat is sold as antifermentive is simply the well-known antiseptic,\r\nsalicylate of soda. It should be self-evident to one at all acquainted\r\nwith the philosophy of animal existence, that an agent which will\r\nprevent fermentation and decay must be sufficiently powerful in its\r\ninfluence to prevent digestion also.\r\n\r\nThe fermentation and decay of fruits as well as that of all other\r\norganic substances, is occasioned by the action of those minute living\r\norganisms which scientists call germs, and which are everywhere present.\r\nThese germs are very much less active in a dry, cold atmosphere, and\r\nfruit may be preserved for quite a long period by refrigeration, an\r\narrangement whereby the external air is excluded, and the surrounding\r\natmosphere kept at an equal temperature of about 40° F. The most\r\nefficient and wholesome method of preserving fruit, however, is\r\ndestruction of the germs and entire exclusion from the air. The germs\r\nare destroyed at a boiling temperature; hence, if fruit be heated to\r\nboiling, and when in this condition sealed in air-tight receptacles, it\r\nwill keep for an unlimited period.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANNING FRUIT.\r\n\r\nCanning consists in sealing in air-tight cans or jars, fruit which has\r\nbeen previously boiled. It is a very simple process, but requires a\r\nthorough understanding of the scientific principles involved, and\r\ncareful management, to make it successful. The result of painstaking\r\neffort is so satisfactory, however, it is well worth all the trouble,\r\nand fruit canning need not be a difficult matter if attention is given\r\nto the following details:--\r\n\r\nSelect self-sealing glass cans of some good variety. Tin cans give more\r\ntrouble filling and sealing, are liable to affect the flavor of the\r\nfruit, and unless manufactured from the best of material, to impair its\r\nwholesomeness. Glass cans may be used more than once, and are thus much\r\nmore economical. Those with glass covers, or porcelain-lined covers, are\r\nbest. Test the cans to see if they are perfect, with good rubbers and\r\ncovers that fit closely, by partly filling them with cold water,\r\nscrewing on the tops, and placing bottom upward upon the table for some\r\ntime before using. If none of the water leaks out, they may be\r\nconsidered in good condition. If the cans have been previously used,\r\nexamine them with special care to see that both cans and covers have\r\nbeen carefully cleaned, then thoroughly sterilize them, and fit with new\r\nrubbers when necessary.\r\n\r\nCans and covers should be sterilized by boiling in water for half an\r\nhour, or by baking in an oven, at a temperature sufficient to scorch\r\npaper, for two hours. The cans should be placed in the water or oven\r\nwhen cold, and the temperature allowed to rise gradually, to avoid\r\nbreaking. They should be allowed to cool gradually, for the same\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nSelect only the best of fruit, such as is perfect in flavor and neither\r\ngreen nor over-ripe. Fruit which has been shipped from a distance, and\r\nwhich is consequently not perfectly fresh, contains germs in active\r\ngrowth, and if the least bit musty, it will be almost sure to spoil,\r\neven though the greatest care may be taken in canning.\r\n\r\nPoor fruit will not be improved by canning; over-ripe fruit will be\r\ninsipid and mushy; and though cooking will soften hard fruit, it cannot\r\nimpart to it the delicate flavors which belong to that which is in its\r\nprime. The larger varieties of fruit should not be quite soft enough for\r\neating. Choose a dry day for gathering, and put up at once, handling as\r\nlittle as possible. Try to keep it clean enough to avoid washing. If the\r\nfruit is to be pared, use a silver knife for the purpose, as steel is\r\napt to discolor the fruit. If the fruit is one needing to be divided or\r\nstoned, it will be less likely to become broken if divided before\r\nparing.\r\n\r\nCook the fruit slowly in a porcelain-lined or granite-ware kettle, using\r\nas little water as possible. It is better to cook only small quantities\r\nat a time in one kettle. Steaming in the cans is preferable to stewing,\r\nwhere the fruit is at all soft. To do this, carefully fill the cans with\r\nfresh fruit, packing it quite closely, if the fruit is large, and set\r\nthe cans in a boiler partly filled with cold water, with something\r\nunderneath them to prevent breaking,--muffin rings, straw, or thick\r\ncloth, or anything to keep them from resting on the bottom of the boiler\r\n(a rack made by nailing together strips of lath is very convenient);\r\nscrew the covers on the cans so the water cannot boil into them, but not\r\nso tightly as to prevent the escape of steam; heat the water to boiling,\r\nand steam the fruit until tender. Peaches, pears, crab apples, etc., to\r\nbe canned with a syrup, may be advantageously cooked by placing on a\r\nnapkin dropped into the boiling syrup.\r\n\r\nFruit for canning should be so thoroughly cooked that every portion of\r\nit will have been subjected to a sufficient degree of heat to destroy\r\nall germs within the fruit, but overcooking should be avoided. The\r\nlength of time required for cooking fruits for canning, varies with the\r\nkind and quality of fruit and the manner of cooking. Fruit is more\r\nfrequently spoiled by being cooked an insufficient length of time, than\r\nby overcooking. Prolonged cooking at a boiling temperature is necessary\r\nfor the destruction of certain kinds of germs capable of inducing\r\nfermentation. Fifteen minutes may be considered as the shortest time for\r\nwhich even the most delicate fruits should be subjected to the\r\ntemperature of boiling water, and thirty minutes will be required by\r\nmost fruits. Fruits which are not perfectly fresh, or which have been\r\nshipped some distance, should be cooked not less than thirty minutes.\r\nThe boiling should be very slow, however, as hard, rapid boiling will\r\nbreak up the fruit, and much of its fine flavor will be lost in the\r\nsteam.\r\n\r\nCooking the sugar with the fruit at the time of canning, is not to be\r\nrecommended from an economical standpoint; but fruit thus prepared is\r\nmore likely to keep well than when cooked without sugar; not, however,\r\nbecause of the preservative influence of the sugar, which is too small\r\nin amount to prevent the action of germs, as in the case of preserves,\r\nbut because the addition of sugar to the water or fruit juice increases\r\nits specific gravity, and thus raises the boiling point. From\r\nexperiments made, I have found that the temperature of the fruit is\r\nordinarily raised about 5° by the addition of the amount of sugar needed\r\nfor sweetening sub-acid fruit. By the aid of this additional degree of\r\nheat, the germs are more certainly destroyed, and the sterilization of\r\nthe fruit will be accomplished in a shorter time.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage gained in cooking sugar with the fruit at the time of\r\ncanning, is that the fruit may be cooked for a longer time without\r\ndestroying its form, as the sugar abstracts the juice of the fruit, and\r\nthus slightly hardens it and prevents its falling in pieces.\r\n\r\nThe temperature to which the fruit is subjected may also be increased by\r\nthe same method as that elsewhere described for sterilizing milk, the\r\ncovers of the cans being screwed down tightly before they are placed in\r\nthe sterilizer, or as soon as the boiling point is approached, so that\r\nthe steam issues freely from the can. See page 396. If this method is\r\nemployed, it must be remembered that the cans should not be removed from\r\nthe sterilizer until after they have become cold, or nearly so, by being\r\nallowed to stand over night.\r\n\r\nUse the best sugar, two tablespoonfuls to a quart of fruit is\r\nsufficient for most sub-acid fruits, as berries and peaches; plums,\r\ncherries, strawberries, and currants require from five to eight\r\ntablespoonfuls of sugar to a quart. Have the sugar hot, by spreading it\r\non tins and heating in the oven, stirring occasionally. See that; it\r\ndoes not scorch. Add it when the fruit is boiling. Pears, peaches,\r\napples, etc., which contain a much smaller quantity of juice than do\r\nberries, may be canned in a syrup prepared by dissolving a cup of sugar\r\nin two or three cups of water. Perfect fruit, properly canned, will keep\r\nwithout sugar, and the natural 'flavor of the fruit is more perfectly\r\nretained when the sugar is left out, adding the necessary amount when\r\nopened for use.\r\n\r\nIf the fruit is to be cooked previous to being put in the cans, the cans\r\nshould be heated before the introduction of the fruit, which should be\r\nput in at a boiling temperature. Various methods are employed for this\r\npurpose. Some wrap the can in a towel wrung out of hot water, keeping a\r\nsilver spoon inside while it is being filled; others employ dry heat by\r\nkeeping the cans in a moderately hot oven while the fruit is cooking.\r\n\r\nAnother and surer way is to fill a large dishpan nearly full of scalding\r\n(not boiling) water, then gradually introduce each can, previously\r\nbaked, into the water, dip it full of water, and set it right side up in\r\nthe pan. Repeat the process with other cans until four or five are\r\nready. Put the covers likewise into boiling water. Have in readiness for\r\nuse a granite-ware funnel and dipper, also in boiling water; a cloth for\r\nwiping the outside of the cans, a silver fork or spoon, a dish for\r\nemptyings, and a broad shallow pan on one side of the range, half filled\r\nwith boiling water, in which to set the cans while being filled. When\r\neverything is in readiness, the fruit properly cooked, and _at a boiling\r\ntemperature,_ turn one of the cans down in the water, roll it over once\r\nor twice, empty it, and set in the shallow pan of hot water; adjust the\r\nfunnel, and then place first in the can a quantity of juice, so that\r\nwhen the fruit is put in, no vacant places will be left for air, which\r\nis sometimes quite troublesome if this precaution is not taken; then\r\nadd the fruit. If any bubbles of air chance to be left, work them out\r\nwith a fork or spoon handle, which first dip in boiling water, and then\r\nquickly introduce down the sides of the jar and through the fruit in\r\nsuch a way that not a bubble will remain. Fill the can to overflowing,\r\nremembering that any vacuum invites the air to enter; use boiling water\r\nor syrup when there is not enough juice. Skim all froth from the fruit,\r\nadding more juice if necessary; wipe the juice from the top of the can,\r\nadjust the rubber, put on the top, and screw it down as quickly as\r\npossible. If the fruit is cooked in the cans, as soon as it is\r\nsufficiently heated, fill the can completely full with boiling juice,\r\nsyrup, or water; run the handle of a silver spoon around the inside of\r\nthe can, to make sure the juice entirely surrounds every portion of\r\nfruit, and that no spaces for air remain, put on the rubbers, wipe off\r\nall juice, and seal quickly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Canning Utensils.]\r\n\r\nAs the fruit cools, the cover can be tightened, and this should be\r\npromptly done again and again as the glass contracts, so that no air may\r\nbe allowed to enter.\r\n\r\nIf convenient to fill the cans directly from the stove, the fruit may be\r\nkept at boiling heat by placing the kettle on a lamp stove on the table,\r\non which the other utensils are in readiness. Many failures in fruit\r\ncanning are due to neglect to have the fruit boiling hot when put into\r\nthe cans.\r\n\r\nWhen the cans are filled, set them away from currents of air, and not on\r\na very cold surface, to avoid danger of cracking. A good way is to set\r\nthe cans on a wet towel, and cover with a woolen cloth as a protection\r\nfrom draughts.\r\n\r\nAfter the cans have cooled, and the tops have been screwed down tightly,\r\nplace them in a cool place, bottom upward, and watch closely for a few\r\ndays. If the juice begins to leak out, or any appearance of fermentation\r\nis seen, it is a sign that the work has failed, and the only thing to do\r\nis to open the can immediately, boil the fruit, and use as quickly as\r\npossible; recanning will not save it unless boiled a long time. If no\r\nsigns of spoiling are observed within two or three weeks, the fruit may\r\nbe safely stored away in a dark, cool place. If one has no dark\r\nstoreroom, it is an advantage to wrap each can in brown paper, to keep\r\nout the light.\r\n\r\nSometimes the fruit will settle so that a little space appears at the\r\ntop. If you are perfectly sure that the can is tight, do not open to\r\nrefill, as you will be unable to make it quite as tight again, unless\r\nyou reheat the fruit, in which case you would be liable to have the same\r\nthing occur again. Air is dangerous because it is likely to contain\r\ngerms, though in itself harmless.\r\n\r\nIf mold is observed upon the top of a can, it should be opened, and the\r\nfruit boiled and used at once, after carefully skimming out all the\r\nmoldy portions. If there is evidence of fermentation, the fruit should\r\nbe thrown away, as it contains alcohol.\r\n\r\nIf care be taken to provide good cans, thoroughly sterilized, and with\r\nperfectly fitting covers; to use only fruit in good condition; to have\r\nit thoroughly cooked, and at boiling temperature when put into the can;\r\nto have the cans well baked and heated, filled completely and to\r\noverflowing, and sealed at once while the fruit is still near boiling\r\ntemperature, there will be little likelihood of failure.\r\n\r\nOPENING CANNED FRUIT.--Canned fruit is best opened a short time\r\nbefore needed, that is may be will aërated; and if it has been canned\r\nwithout sugar, it should have the necessary quantity added, so that it\r\nmay be well dissolved before using.\r\n\r\nFruit purchased in tin cans should be selected with the utmost care,\r\nsince unscrupulous dealers sometimes use cans which render the fruit\r\nwholly--unfit for food.\r\n\r\nThe following rules which we quote from a popular scientific journal\r\nshould be 'carefully observed in selecting canned fruit:--\r\n\r\n\"Reject every can that does not have the name of the manufacturer or\r\nfirm upon it, as well as the name of the company and the town where\r\nmanufactured. All 'Standards' have this. When the wholesale dealer is\r\nashamed to have his name on the goods, be shy of him.\r\n\r\n\"Reject every article of canned goods which does not show the line of\r\nresin around the edge of the solder of the cap, the same as is seen on\r\nthe seam at the side of the can.\r\n\r\n\"Press up the bottom of the can; if decomposition is beginning, the tin\r\nwill rattle the same as the bottom of your sewing-machine oil can does.\r\nIf the goods are sound, it will be solid, and there will be no rattle to\r\nthe tin.\r\n\r\n\"Reject every can that show any rust around the cap on the inside of the\r\nhead of the can. Old and battered cans should be rejected; as, if they\r\nhave been used several times, the contents are liable to contain small\r\namounts of tin or lead\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nTO CAN STRAWBERRIES.--These are generally considered more difficult\r\nto can than most other berries. Use none but sound fruit, and put up the\r\nday they are picked, if possible. Heat the fruit slowly to the boiling\r\npoint, and cook fifteen minutes or longer, adding the sugar hot, if any\r\nbe used, after the fruit is boiling. Strawberries, while cooking, have a\r\ntendency to rise to the top, and unless they are kept poshed down, will\r\nnot be cooked uniformly, which is doubtless one reason they sometimes\r\nfail to keep well. The froth should also be kept skimmed off. Fill the\r\ncans as directed on page 197, taking special care to let out every air\r\nbubble, and to remove every particle of froth from the top of the can\r\nbefore sealing. If the berries are of good size, the may be cooked in\r\nthe cans, adding a boiling syrup prepared with one cup of water and one\r\nof sugar for each quart can of fruit.\r\n\r\nIf after the cans are cold, the fruit rises to the top, as it frequently\r\ndoes, take the cans and gently shake until the fruit is well saturated\r\nwith the juice and falls by its own weight to the bottom, or low enough\r\nto be entirely covered with the liquid.\r\n\r\nTO CAN RASPBERRIES, BLACKBERRIES, AND OTHER SMALL FRUITS.--Select\r\nnone but good, sound berries; those freshly picked are best; reject any\r\ngreen, over-ripe, mashed, or worm-eaten fruit. If necessary to wash the\r\nberries, do so by putting a quart at a time in a colander, and dipping\r\nthe dish carefully into a pan of clean water, letting it stand for a\r\nmoment. If the water is very dirty, repeat the process in a second\r\nwater. Drain thoroughly, and if to be cooked previous to putting in the\r\ncans, put into a porcelain kettle with a very small quantity of water,\r\nand heat slowly to boiling. If sugar is to be used, have it hot, but do\r\nnot add it until the fruit is boiling; and before doing so, if there is\r\nmuch juice, dip out the surplus, and leave the berries with only a small\r\nquantity, as the sugar will have a tendency to draw out more juice, thus\r\nfurnishing plenty for syrup.\r\n\r\nRaspberries are so juicy that they need scarcely more than a pint of\r\nwater to two quarts of fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit may be steamed in the cans if preferred. When thoroughly\r\nscalded, if sugar is to be used, fill the can with a boiling syrup made\r\nby dissolving the requisite amount of sugar in water; if to be canned\r\nwithout sugar, fill up the can with boiling water or juice.\r\n\r\nSeal the fruit according to directions previously given.\r\n\r\nTO CAN GOOSEBERRIES.--Select such as are smooth and turning red,\r\nbut not fully ripe; wash and remove the stems and blossom ends. For\r\nthree quarts of fruit allow one quart of water. Heat slowly to boiling;\r\ncook fifteen minutes, add a cupful of sugar which has been heated dry\r\nin the oven: boil two or three minutes longer, and can.\r\n\r\nTO CAN PEACHES.--Select fruit which is perfectly ripe and sound,\r\nbut not much softened. Free-stone peaches are the best. Put a few at a\r\ntime in a wire basket, and dip into boiling water for a moment, and then\r\ninto cold water, to cool fruit sufficiently to handle with comfort. The\r\nskins may then be rubbed or peeled off easily, if done quickly, and the\r\nfruit divided into halves; or wipe with a clean cloth to remove all dirt\r\nand the wool, and with a silver knife cut in halves, remove the stone,\r\nand then pare each piece, dropping into cold water at once to prevent\r\ndiscoloration. Peaches cut before being pared are less likely to break\r\nin pieces while removing the stones. When ready, pour a cupful of water\r\nin the bottom of the kettle, and fill with peaches, scattering sugar\r\namong the layers in the proportion of a heaping tablespoonful to a quart\r\nof fruit. Heat slowly, boil fifteen minutes or longer till a silver fork\r\ncan be easily passed through the pieces; can in the usual way and seal;\r\nor, fill the cans with the halved peaches, and place them in a boiler of\r\nwarm water with something underneath to avoid breaking; cook until\r\nperfectly tender. Have ready a boiling syrup prepared with one half cup\r\nof sugar and two cups of water, and pour into each can all that it will\r\nhold, remove air bubbles, cover and seal. A few of the pits may be\r\ncooked in the syrup, and removed before adding to the fruit, when their\r\nspecial flavor is desired.\r\n\r\nANOTHER METHOD.--After paring and halving the fruit, lay a clean napkin\r\nin the bottom of a steamer; fill with fruit. Steam until a fork will\r\neasily penetrate the pieces. Have ready a boiling syrup prepared as\r\ndirected above, put a few spoonfuls in the bottom of the hot cans, and\r\ndip each piece of fruit gently in the hot syrup; then as carefully place\r\nit in the jars. Fill with the syrup, and finish in the usual way.\r\n\r\nPeaches canned without sugar, retain more nearly their natural flavor.\r\nTo prepare in this way, allow one half pint of water to each pound of\r\nfruit. Cook slowly until tender, and can in the usual manner. When\r\nwanted for the table, open an hour before needed, and sprinkle lightly\r\nwith sugar.\r\n\r\nTO CAN PEARS.--The pears should be perfectly ripened, but not soft.\r\nPare with a silver knife, halve or quarter, remove the seeds and drop\r\ninto a pan of cold water to prevent discoloration. Prepare a syrup,\r\nallowing a cup of sugar and a quart of water to each two quarts of\r\nfruit. When the syrup boils, put the pears into it very carefully, so as\r\nnot to bruise or break them, and cook until they look clear and can be\r\neasily pierced with a fork. Have the cans heated, and put in first a\r\nlittle of the syrup, then pack in the pears very carefully; fill to\r\noverflowing with the scalding syrup, and finish as previously directed.\r\nThe tougher and harder varieties of pears must be cooked till nearly\r\ntender in hot water, or steamed over a kettle of boiling water, before\r\nadding to the syrup, and may then be finished as above. If it is\r\ndesirable to keep the pears whole, cook only those of a uniform size\r\ntogether; or if of assorted sizes, put the larger ones into the syrup a\r\nfew minutes before the smaller ones. Some prefer boiling the kins of the\r\npears in the water of which the syrup is to be made, and skimming them\r\nout before putting in the sugar. This is thought to impart a finer\r\nflavor. Pears which are very sweet, or nearly tasteless, may be improved\r\nby using the juice of a large lemon for each quart of syrup. Pears may\r\nbe cooked in the cans, if preferred.\r\n\r\nTO CAN PLUMS.--Green Gages and Damsons are best for canning. Wipe\r\nclean with a soft cloth. Allow a half cup of water and the same of sugar\r\nto every three quarts of fruit, in preparing a syrup. Pick each plum\r\nwith a silver fork to prevent it from bursting, and while the syrup is\r\nheating, turn in the fruit, and boil until thoroughly done. Dip\r\ncarefully into hot jars, fill with syrup, and cover immediately.\r\n\r\nTO CAN CHERRIES.--These may be put up whole in the same way as\r\nplums, or pitted and treated as directed for berries, allowing about two\r\nquarts of water and a scant pint of sugar to five quarts of solid fruit,\r\nfor the tart varieties, and not quite half as much sugar for the sweeter\r\nones.\r\n\r\nTO CAN MIXED FRUIT.--There are some fruits with so little flavor\r\nthat when cooked they are apt to taste insipid, and are much improved by\r\ncanning with some acid or strongly flavored fruits.\r\n\r\nBlackberries put up with equal quantities of blue or red plums, or in\r\nthe proportion of one to three of the sour fruit, are much better than\r\neither of these fruits canned separately. Black caps are much better if\r\ncanned with currants, in the proportion of one part currants to four of\r\nblack caps.\r\n\r\nRed and black raspberries, cherries and raspberries, are also excellent\r\ncombinations.\r\n\r\nQUINCES WITH APPLES.--Pare and cut an equal quantity of firm sweet\r\napples and quinces. First stew the quinces till they are tender in\r\nsufficient water to cover. Take them out, and cook the apples in the\r\nsame water. Lay the apples and quinces in alternate layers in a\r\nporcelain kettle or crock. Have ready a hot syrup made with one part\r\nsugar to two and a half parts water, pour over the fruit, and let it\r\nstand all night. The next day reheat to boiling, and can.\r\n\r\nQuinces and sweet apples may be canned in the same way as directed below\r\nfor plums and sweet apples, using equal parts of apples and quinces, and\r\nadding sugar when opened.\r\n\r\nPLUMS WITH SWEET APPLES.--Prepare the plums, and stew in water\r\nenough to cover. When tender, skim out, add to the juice an equal\r\nquantity of quartered sweet apples, and stew until nearly tender. Add\r\nthe plumbs again, boil together for a few minutes, and can. When wanted\r\nfor the table, open, sprinkle with sugar if any seems needed, let stand\r\nawhile and serve.\r\n\r\nTO CAN GRAPES.--Grapes have so many seeds that they do not form a\r\nvery palatable sauce when canned entire. Pick carefully from the stems,\r\nwash in a colander the same as directed for berries, and drain. Remove\r\nthe skins, dropping them into one earthen crock and the pulp into\r\nanother. Place both crocks in kettles of hot water over the stove, and\r\nheat slowly, stirring the pulp occasionally until the seeds will come\r\nout clean.\r\n\r\nThen rub the pulp through a colander, add the skins to it, and a cupful\r\nof sugar for each quart of pulp. Return to the fire, boil twenty minutes\r\nuntil the skins are tender, and can; or, if preferred, the whole grapes\r\nmay be heated, and when well scalded so that the seeds are loosened,\r\npressed through a colander, thus rejecting both seeds and skins, boiled,\r\nthen sweetened if desired, and canned.\r\n\r\nTO CAN CRAB APPLES.--These may be cooked whole, and canned the same\r\nway as plums.\r\n\r\nTO CAN APPLES.--Prepare and can the same as pears, when fresh and\r\nfine in flavor. If old and rather tasteless, the following is a good\r\nway:--several thin slices of the yellow part of the rind, four cups of\r\nsugar, and three pints of boiling water. Pare and quarter the apples, or\r\nif small, only halve them, and cook gently in a broad-bottomed\r\nclosely-covered saucepan, with as little water as possible, till tender,\r\nbut not broken; then pour the syrup over them, heat all to boiling, and\r\ncan at once. The apples may be cooked by steaming over a kettle of hot\r\nwater, if preferred. Care must be taken to cook those of the same degree\r\nof hardness together. The slices of lemon rind should be removed from\r\nthe syrup before using.\r\n\r\nTO CAN PINEAPPLES.--The writer has had no experience in canning\r\nthis fruit, but the following method is given on good authority: Pare\r\nvery carefully with a silver knife, remove all the \"eyes\" and black\r\nspecks; then cut the sections in which the \"eyes\" were, in solid pieces\r\nclear down to the core. By doing this all the valuable part of the fruit\r\nis saved, leaving its hard, woody center. As, however, this contains\r\nconsiderable juice, it should be taken in the hands and wrung as one\r\nwrings a cloth, till the juice is extracted, then thrown away. Prepare a\r\nsyrup with one part sugar and two parts water, using what juice has been\r\nobtained in place of so much water. Let it boil up, skim clean, then add\r\nthe fruit. Boil just as little as possible and have the fruit tender, as\r\npineapples loses its flavor by overcooking more readily than any other\r\nfruit. Put into hot cans, and seal.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUIT JELLIES.\r\n\r\nThe excess of sugar commonly employed in preparing jellies often renders\r\nthem the least wholesome of fruit preparations, and we cannot recommend\r\nour readers to spend a great amount of time in putting up a large stock\r\nof such articles.\r\n\r\nThe juice of some fruits taken at the right stage of maturity may be\r\nevaporated to a jelly without sugar, but the process is a more lengthy\r\none, and requires a much larger quantity of juice than when sugar is\r\nused.\r\n\r\nSuccess in the preparation of fruit jellies depends chiefly upon the\r\namount of pectose contained in the fruit. Such fruits as peaches,\r\ncherries, and others containing but a small proportion of pectose,\r\ncannot be made into a firm jelly. All fruit for jelly should, if\r\npossible, be freshly picked, and before it is over-ripe, as it has then\r\na much better flavor. The pectose, the jelly-producing element,\r\ndeteriorates with age, so that jelly made from over-ripe fruit is less\r\ncertain to \"form.\" If the fruit is under-ripe, it will be too acid to\r\ngive a pleasant flavor. Examine carefully, as for canning, rejecting all\r\nwormy, knotty, unripe, or partially decayed fruit. If necessary to wash,\r\ndrain very thoroughly.\r\n\r\nApples, quinces, and similar fruits may require to be first cooked in a\r\nsmall amount of water. The juice of berries, currants, and grapes, may\r\nbe best extracted by putting the fruit in a granite-ware double boiler,\r\nor a covered earthen crock placed inside a kettle of boiling water,\r\nmashing as much as possible with a spoon, and steaming without the\r\naddition of water until the fruit is well scalded and broken.\r\n\r\nFor straining the juice, have a funnel-shaped bag made of coarse flannel\r\nor strong, coarse linen crash. The bag will be found more handy if a\r\nsmall hoop of wire is sewn around the top and two tapes attached to hang\r\nit by while the hot juice is draining, or a wooden frame to support the\r\nbag may be easily constructed like the one shown on page 74. A dish to\r\nreceive the juice should be placed underneath the bag, which should\r\nfirst be wrung out of hot water, and the scalded fruit, a small quantity\r\nat a time, turned in; then with two large spoons press the sides of the\r\nbag well, moving the fruit around in the bag to get out all the juice,\r\nand removing the pressed pulp and skins each time before putting in a\r\nfresh supply of the hot fruit. If a very clear jelly is desired, the\r\njuice must be allowed to drain out without pressing or squeezing. The\r\njuice of berries, grapes, and currants may be extracted without the\r\nfruit being first scalded, if preferred, by putting the fruit into an\r\nearthen or granite-ware dish, and mashing well with a wooden potato\r\nmasher, then putting into a jelly bag and allowing the juice to drain\r\noff for several hours.\r\n\r\nWhen strained, if the jelly is to be prepared with sugar, measure the\r\njuice and pour it into a granite or porcelain fruit kettle with a very\r\nbroad bottom, so that as much surface can be on the stove possible. It\r\nis better to boil the juice in quantities of not more than two or three\r\nquarts at a time, unless one has some utensil in which a larger quantity\r\ncan be cooked with no greater depth of liquid than the above quantity\r\nwould give in a common fruit kettle. The purpose of the boiling is to\r\nevaporate the water from the juice, and this can best be accomplished\r\nbefore the sugar is added. The sugar, if boiled with the juice, also\r\ndarkens the jelly.\r\n\r\nThe average length of time required for boiling the juice of most\r\nberries, currants, and grapes, extracted as previously directed, before\r\nadding the sugar, is twenty minutes from the time it begins to bubble\r\nall over its surface. It is well to test the jelly occasionally,\r\nhowever, by dropping a small quantity on a plate to cool, since the\r\nquantity of juice and the rapidity with which it is boiled, may\r\nnecessitate some variation in time. In wet season, fruits of all kinds\r\nabsorb more moisture and a little longer boiling may be necessary. The\r\nsame is true of the juice of fruits gathered after a heavy rain. Jellies\r\nprepared with sugar are generally made of equal measures of juice,\r\nmeasured before boiling, and sugar; but a very scant measure of sugar is\r\nsufficient, and a less amount will suffice for many fruits. White\r\ngranulated sugar is best for all jellies. While the juice is heating,\r\nspread the sugar evenly on shallow tins, and heat in the oven, stirring\r\noccasionally to keep it from scorching. If portions melt, no great harm\r\nwill be done, as the melted portions will form in lumps when turned into\r\nthe juice, and can be removed with a spoon. When the juice has boiled\r\ntwenty minutes, turn in the sugar, which should be so hot that the hand\r\ncannot be borne in it with comfort, stirring rapidly until it is all\r\ndissolved. Let the syrup boil again for three or four minutes, then take\r\nimmediately from the fire. Heat the jelly glasses (those with glass\r\ncovers are best), by rolling in hot water, and place them in a shallow\r\npan partially filled with hot water, or stand them on a wet, folded\r\ntowel while filling. If it is desired to have the jelly exceptionally\r\nclear and nice, it may be turned through a bag of cheese cloth,\r\npreviously wrung out of hot water, into the jelly glasses. If the covers\r\nof the glasses are not tight fitting, a piece of firm paper should be\r\nfitted over the top before putting on the cover, to make it air tight.\r\nPint self-sealing fruit cans are excellent for storing jelly, and if it\r\nis sealed in them in the same manner as canned fruit, will keep\r\nperfectly, and obviate any supposed necessity for the use of brandied\r\npaper as a preservative measure. Label each variety, and keep in some\r\ncool, dry place. If the jelly is not sufficiently firm when first made,\r\nset the glasses in the sunshine for several days, until the jelly\r\nbecomes more firm. This is better than reheating and boiling again, as\r\nit destroys less of the flavor of the fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nAPPLE JELLY.--Cut nice tart apples in quarters, but unless wormy,\r\ndo not peel or core. Put into a porcelain kettle with a cup of water for\r\neach six pounds of fruit, and simmer very slowly until the apples are\r\nthoroughly cooked. Turn into a jelly-bag, and drain off the juice. If\r\nvery tart, allow three fourths of a pound of sugar to each pint of\r\njuice. If sub-acid, one half pound will be sufficient. Put the sugar\r\ninto the oven to heat. Clean the kettle, and boil the juice therein\r\ntwenty minutes after it begins to boil thoroughly. Add the sugar,\r\nstirring until well dissolved, let it boil up once again, and remove\r\nfrom the fire. The juice of one lemon may be used with the apples, and a\r\nfew bits of lemon rind, the yellow portion only, cooked with them to\r\ngive them a flavor, if liked. One third cranberry juice makes a pleasing\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\nAPPLE JELLY WITHOUT SUGAR.--Select juicy, white fleshed, sub-acid\r\nfruit, perfectly sound and mature but not mellow. The snow apple is one\r\nof the best varieties for this purpose. Wash well, slice, and core\r\nwithout removing the skins, and cook as directed in the preceding\r\nrecipe. Drain off the juice, and if a very clear jelly is desired,\r\nfilter it through a piece of cheese cloth previously wrung out of hot\r\nwater. Boil the juice,--rapidly at first, but more gently as it becomes\r\nthickened,--until of the desired consistency. The time required will\r\nvary with the quantity of juice, the shallowness of the dish in which it\r\nis boiled, and the heat employed. One hour at least, will be required\r\nfor one or two quarts of juice. When the juice has become considerably\r\nevaporated, test it frequently by dipping a few drops on a plate to\r\ncool; and when it jellies sufficiently, remove at once from the fire. A\r\nmuch larger quantity of juice will be needed for jelly prepared in this\r\nmanner than when sugar is used, about two quarts of juice being required\r\nfor one half pint of jelly. Such jelly, however, has a most delicious\r\nflavor, and is excellent served with grains. Diluted with water, it\r\nforms a most pleasing beverage.\r\n\r\nBERRY AND CURRANT JELLIES.--Express the juice according to the\r\ndirections already given. For strawberries, red raspberries, and\r\ncurrants, allow three fourths of a pound of sugar to a pint of juice.\r\nBlack raspberries, if used alone, need less sugar. Strawberry and black\r\nraspberry juice make better jelly if a little lemon juice is used. The\r\njuice of one lemon to each pint of fruit juice will be needed for black\r\nraspberries. Two parts red or black raspberries with one part currants,\r\nmake a better jelly than either alone. Boil the juice of strawberries,\r\nred raspberries, and currants twenty minutes, add the sugar, and finish,\r\nas previously directed. Black raspberry juice is much thicker, and\r\nrequires less boiling.\r\n\r\nCHERRY JELLY.--Jelly may be prepared from cherries by using with\r\nthe juice of cherries an equal amount of apple juice, which gives an\r\nadditional amount of pectose to the juice and does not perceptibly\r\nchange the flavor.\r\n\r\nCRAB APPLE JELLY.--Choose the best Siberian crab apples; cut into\r\npieces, but do not pare or remove seeds. Place in a porcelain-lined or\r\ngranite-ware double boiler, with a cup of water for each six pounds of\r\nfruit, and let them remain on the back of the range, with the water\r\nslowly boiling, seven or eight hours. Leave in the boiler or turn into a\r\nlarge china bowl, and keep well covered, all night. In the morning drain\r\noff the juice and proceed as for apple jelly, using from one half to\r\nthree fourths of a pound of sugar to one of juice.\r\n\r\nCRANBERRY JELLY.--Scald the berries and express the juice for other\r\njellies. Measure the juice, and allow three fourths of a pound of sugar\r\nto one of juice. Boil twenty minutes, add the sugar hot, and finish as\r\ndirected for other jellies.\r\n\r\nGRAPE JELLY.--Jelly from ripe grapes may be prepared in the same\r\nmanner as that made from the juice of berries. Jelly from green grapes\r\nneeds one half measure more of sugar.\r\n\r\nORANGE JELLY.--Express the juice of rather tart oranges, and use\r\nwith it an equal quantity of the juice of sub-acid apples, prepared in\r\nthe manner directed for apple jelly. For each pint of the mixed juice,\r\nuse one half pound of sugar and proceed as for other jellies.\r\n\r\nPEACH JELLY.--Stone, pare, and slice the peaches, and steam them in\r\na double boiler. Express the juice, and add for each pint of peach juice\r\nthe juice of one lemon. Measure the juice and sugar, using three fourths\r\nof a pound of sugar for each pint of juice, and proceed as already\r\ndirected. Jelly prepared from peaches will not be so firm as many fruit\r\njellies, owing to the small amount of pectose contained in their\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nA mixture of apples and peaches, in the proportion of one third of the\r\nformer to two thirds of the latter, makes a firmer jelly than peaches\r\nalone. The apples should be pared and cored, so that their flavor will\r\nnot interfere with that of the peaches.\r\n\r\nQUINCE JELLY.--Clean thoroughly good sound fruit, and slice thin.\r\nPut into a double boiler with one cup of water for each five pounds of\r\nfruit, and cook until softened. Express the juice, and proceed as with\r\nother jellies, allowing three fourths of a pound of sugar to each pint\r\nof juice. Tart or sweet apples may be used with quinces, in equal\r\nproportions, and make a jelly of more pleasant flavor than quinces used\r\nalone. The seeds of quinces contain considerable gelatinous substance,\r\nand should be cooked with the quince for jelly making.\r\n\r\nPLUM JELLY.--Use Damsons or Green Gages. Stone, and make in the\r\nsame way as for berry and other small fruit jellies.\r\n\r\nFRUIT IN JELLY.--Prepare some apple jelly without sugar. When\r\nboiled sufficiently to form, add to it, as it begins to cool, some nice,\r\nstoned dates or seeded raisins. Orange jelly may be used instead of the\r\napple jelly, if preferred.\r\n\r\nFRUIT JUICES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs sauces for desserts and for summer beverages for sick or well, the\r\npure juices of fruits are most wholesome and delicious. So useful are\r\nthey and so little trouble to prepare, that no housewife should allow\r\nthe fruit season to pass by without putting up a full stock.\r\nStrawberries, raspberries, blackberries, currants, grapes, and cherries\r\nare especially desirable. In preparing them, select only the best fruit,\r\nripe, but not over-ripe. Extract the juice by mashing the fruit and\r\nslowly heating in the inner cup of a double boiler, till the fruit is\r\nwell scalded; too long heating will injure its color. Strain through a\r\njelly bag and let it drain slowly for a long time, but do not squeeze,\r\nelse some of the pulp will be forced through. Reheat slowly to boiling\r\nand can the same as fruit. It may be put up with or without sugar. If\r\nsugar is to be used, add it hot as for jelly, after the juice is\r\nstrained and reheated to boiling. For strawberries and currants,\r\nraspberries and cherries, use one cup of sugar to a quart of juice.\r\nBlack raspberries and grapes require less sugar, while blueberries and\r\nblackberries require none at all, or not more than a tablespoonful to\r\nthe quart. A mixed juice, of one part currants and two parts red or\r\nblack raspberries, has a very superior flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nGRAPE JUICE, OR UNFERMENTED WINE.--Take twenty-five pounds of some\r\nwell ripened very juicy variety of grapes, like the Concord. Pick them\r\nfrom the stems, wash thoroughly, and scald without the addition of\r\nwater, in double boilers until the grapes burst open; cool, turn into\r\nstout jelly bags, and drain off the juice without squeezing. Let the\r\njuice stand and settle; turn off the top, leaving any sediment there may\r\nbe. Add to the juice about four pounds of best granulated sugar, reheat\r\nto boiling, skim carefully, and can the same as fruit. Keep in a cool,\r\ndark place. The wine, if to be sealed in bottles, will require a corker,\r\nand the corks should first be boiled in hot water and the bottles well\r\nsterilized.\r\n\r\nGRAPE JUICE NO. 2.--Take grapes of the best quality, picked fresh\r\nfrom the vines. Wash well after stripping from the stems, rejecting any\r\nimperfect fruit. Put them in a porcelain or granite fruit kettle with\r\none pint of water to every three quarts of grapes, heat to boiling, and\r\ncook slowly for fifteen minutes or longer, skimming as needed. Turn off\r\nthe juice and carefully filter it through a jelly bag, putting the seeds\r\nand skins into a separate bag to drain, as the juice from them will be\r\nless clear. Heat again to boiling, add one cupful of hot sugar to each\r\nquart of juice, and seal in sterilized cans or bottles. The juice from\r\nthe skins and seeds should be canned separately.\r\n\r\nANOTHER METHOD.--Wash the grapes, and express the juice without\r\nscalding the fruit. Strain the juice three or four times through muslin\r\nor cheese cloth, allowing it to stand and settle for some time between\r\neach filtering. To every three pints of juice add one of water and two\r\ncupfuls of sugar. Heat to boiling, and keep at that temperature for\r\nfifteen minutes, skim carefully, and bottle while at boiling heat. Set\r\naway in a cool, dark place.\r\n\r\nFRUIT SYRUP.--Prepare the juice expressed from strawberries,\r\nraspberries, currants, or grapes, as directed above for fruit juices.\r\nAfter it has come to a boil, add one pound of sugar to every quart of\r\njuice. Seal in pint cans. It may be diluted with water to form a\r\npleasing beverage, and is especially useful in flavoring puddings and\r\nsauces.\r\n\r\nCURRANT SYRUP.--Boil together a pint of pure currant juice and one\r\nhalf pound of best white sugar for ten minutes, and can or bottle while\r\nat boiling temperature. One or two spoonfuls of the syrup in a glass of\r\nwater makes a most refreshing drink. Two parts currants and one of red\r\nraspberries may be used in place of all currants, if preferred.\r\n\r\nORANGE SYRUP.--Select ripe and thin-skinned fruit. To every pint of\r\nthe juice add one pound of sugar, the juice of one lemon, and a little\r\nof the grated rind. Boil for fifteen minutes, removing all scum as it\r\nrises. If the syrup is not clear, strain through a piece of cheese\r\ncloth, and reheat. Can and seal while boiling hot.\r\n\r\nLEMON SYRUP.--Grate the yellow portion of the rind of six lemons,\r\nand mix with three pounds of best granulated white sugar. Add one quart\r\nof water and boil until it thickens. Strain, add the juice of the six\r\nlemons, carefully leaving out the pulp and seeds; boil ten minutes, and\r\nbottle. Diluted with two thirds cold water, it forms a delicious and\r\nquickly prepared lemonade.\r\n\r\nLEMON SYRUP NO. 2.--To every pint of lemon juice add one pound of\r\nsugar; boil, skim, and seal in cans like fruit.\r\n\r\nBLACKBERRY SYRUP.--Crush fresh, well-ripened blackberries, and add\r\nto them one fourth as much boiling water as berries; let them stand for\r\ntwenty-four hours, stirring frequently. Strain, add a cup of sugar to\r\neach quart of juice, boil slowly for fifteen minutes, and can.\r\n\r\nFRUIT ICES.--Express the juice from a pint of stoned red cherries,\r\nadd the juice of two lemons, one cup of sugar and a quart of cold water.\r\nStir well for five minutes, an freeze in an ice cream freezer. Equal\r\nparts currant and red raspberry juice may be used instead of cherry, if\r\npreferred.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRYING FRUIT.\r\n\r\nThis method of preserving fruit, except in large establishments where it\r\nis dried by steam, is but little used, since canning is quicker and\r\nsuperior in every way. Success in drying fruits is dependent upon the\r\nquickness with which, they can be dried, without subjecting them to so\r\nviolent a heat as to burn them or injure their flavor.\r\n\r\nPulpy fruits, such as berries, cherries, plums, etc., should be spread\r\non some convenient flat surface without contact with each other, and\r\ndried in the sun under glass, or in a moderate oven. They should be\r\nturned daily. They will dry more quickly if first scalded in a hot oven.\r\nCherries should be first stoned and cooked until well heated through and\r\ntender, then spread on plates, and the juice (boiled down to a syrup)\r\npoured over them. When dried, they will be moist. Pack in jars. Large\r\nfruit, such as apples, pears, and peaches, should be pared, divided, and\r\nthe seeds or stones removed. If one has but a small quantity, the best\r\nplan is to dry by mean of artificial heat; setting it first in a hot\r\noven until heated through, which process starts the juice and forms a\r\nfilm or crust over the cut surfaces, thus holding the remaining:\r\nquantity of juice inside until it becomes absorbed in the tissues. The\r\ndrying process may be finished in a warming oven or some place about the\r\nrange where the fruit will get only moderate heat. If a larger quantity\r\nof fruit is to be dried, after being heated in the oven, it may be\r\nplaced in the hot sun out of doors, under fine wire screens, to keep off\r\nthe flies; or may be suspended for the ceiling in some way, or placed\r\nupon a frame made to stand directly over the stove. As the drying\r\nproceeds, the fruit should be turned occasionally, and when dry enough,\r\nit should be thoroughly heated before it is packed away, to prevent it\r\nfrom getting wormy.\r\n\r\n\r\nNUTS.\r\n\r\nThe nuts, or shell fruits, as they are sometimes termed, form a class of\r\nfood differing greatly from the succulent fruits. They are more properly\r\nseeds, containing, in general, no starch, but are rich in fat and\r\nnitrogenous elements in the form of vegetable albumen and casein. In\r\ncomposition, the nuts rank high in nutritive value, but owing to the\r\noily matter which they contain, are difficult of digestion, unless\r\nreduced to a very minutely divided state before or during mastication.\r\nThe fat of nuts is similar in character to cream, and needs to be\r\nreduced to the consistency of cream to be easily digested. Those nuts,\r\nsuch as almonds, filberts, and pecans, which do not contain an excess of\r\nfat, are the most wholesome. Nuts should be eaten, in moderation, at the\r\nregular mealtime, and not partaken of as a tidbit between meals. It is\r\nlikewise well to eat them in connection with some hard food, to insure\r\ntheir thorough mastication. Almonds and cream crisps thus used make a\r\npleasing combination.\r\n\r\nMost of the edible nuts have long been known and used as food. The\r\n_Almond_ was highly esteemed by the ancient nations of the East, its\r\nnative habitat, and is frequently referred to in sacred history. It is\r\ngrown extensively in the warm, temperate regions of the Old World. There\r\nare two varieties, known as the bitter and the sweet almond. The kernel\r\nof the almond yields a fixed oil; that produced from the bitter almond\r\nis much esteemed for flavoring purposes, but it is by no means a safe\r\narticle to use, at it possesses marked poisonous qualities. Fresh, sweet\r\nalmonds are a nutritive, and, when properly eaten, wholesome food. The\r\nouter brown skin of the kernel is somewhat bitter, rough, and irritating\r\nto the stomach but it can be easily removed by blanching.\r\n\r\nBlanched almonds, if baked for a short time, become quite brittle, and\r\nmay be easily pulverized, and are then more easily digested. Bread made\r\nfrom almonds thus baked and pulverized, is considered an excellent food\r\nfor persons suffering with diabetes.\r\n\r\n_Brazil Nuts_ are the seeds of a gigantic tree which grows wild in the\r\nvalleys of the Amazon, and throughout tropical America. The case\r\ncontaining these seeds is a hard, woody shell, globular in form, and\r\nabout the size of a man's head. It is divided into four cells, in each\r\nof which are closely packed the seeds which constitute the so-called\r\nnuts, of commerce. These seeds are exceedingly rich in oil, one pound of\r\nthem producing about nine ounces of oil.\r\n\r\nThe _Cocoanut_ is perhaps the most important of all the shell fruits, if\r\nwe may judge by the variety of uses to which the nut and the tree which\r\nbears it can be put. It has been said that nature seldom produces a tree\r\nso variously useful to man as the cocoanut palm. In tropical countries,\r\nwhere it grows abundantly, its leaves are employed for thatching, its\r\nfibers for manufacturing many useful articles, while its ashes produce\r\npotash in abundance. The fruit is eaten raw, and in many ways is\r\nprepared for food; it also yields an oil which forms an important\r\narticle of commerce. The milk of the fruit is a cooling beverage, and\r\nthe woody shell of the nut answers very well for a cup from which to\r\ndrink it. The saccharine juice of the tree also affords an excellent\r\ndrink; and from the fresh young stems is prepared a farinaceous\r\nsubstance similar to sago.\r\n\r\nThe cocoanuts grow in clusters drooping from the tuft of long, fringed\r\nleaves which crown the branchless trunk of the stately palm. The\r\ncocoanut as found in commerce is the nut divested of its outer sheath,\r\nand is much smaller in size than when seen upon the tree. Picked fresh\r\nfrom the tree, the cocoanut consists first of a green outer covering;\r\nnext of a fibrous coat, which, if the nut is mature, is hairy-like in\r\nappearance; and then of the woody shell, inside of which is the meat and\r\nmilk. For household purposes the nuts are gathered while green, and\r\nbefore the inner shell has become solidified; the flesh is then soft\r\nlike custard, and can be easily eaten with a teaspoon, while a large\r\nquantity of delicious, milk-like fluid is obtainable from each nut.\r\n\r\nAs found in our Northern markets, the cocoanut is difficult of\r\ndigestion, as is likewise the prepared or desiccated cocoanut. The\r\ncocoanut contains about seventy per cent of oil.\r\n\r\nThe _Chestnut_ is an exception to most nuts in its composition. It\r\ncontains starch, and about fifteen per cent of sugar. No oil can be\r\nextracted from the chestnut. In Italy, and other parts of Southern\r\nEurope, the chestnut forms an important article of food. It is sometimes\r\ndried and ground into flour, from which bread is prepared. The chestnut\r\nis a nutritious food, but owing to the starch it contains, is more\r\ndigestible when cooked. The same is true of the _Acorn_, which is\r\nsimilar in character to the chestnut. In the early ages, acorns were\r\nlargely used for food, and are still used as a substitute for bread in\r\nsome countries.\r\n\r\nThe _Hazelnut_, with the _Filbert_ and _Cobnut_, varieties of the same\r\nnut obtained by cultivation, are among the most desirable nuts for\r\ngeneral consumption.\r\n\r\nThe _Walnut_, probably a native of Persia, where in ancient times it was\r\nso highly valued as to be considered suited only for the table of the\r\nking, is now found very commonly with other species of the same family,\r\nthe _Butternut_ and _Hickory nut_, in most temperate climates.\r\n\r\nThe _Pecan_, a nut allied to the hickory nut, and grown extensively in\r\nthe Mississippi Valley and Texas, is one of the most easily digested\r\nnuts.\r\n\r\nThe _Peanut_ or _Groundnut_ is the seed of an annual, cultivated\r\nextensively in most tropical and sub-tropical countries. After the plant\r\nhas blossomed, the stalk which produced the flower has the peculiarity\r\nof bending down and forcing itself under ground so that the seeds mature\r\nsome depth beneath the surface. When ripened, the pods containing the\r\nseeds are dug up and dried. In tropical countries the fresh nuts are\r\nlargely consumed, and are thought greatly to resemble almonds in flavor.\r\nIn this country they are more commonly roasted. They are less easily\r\ndigested than many other nuts because of the large amount of oily matter\r\nwhich they contain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nTO BLANCH ALMONDS.--Shell fresh, sweet almonds, and pour boiling\r\nwater over them; let them stand for two or three minutes, skim out, and\r\ndrop into cold water. Press between the thumb and finger, and the\r\nkernels will readily slip out of the brown covering. Dry between clean\r\ntowels. Blanched almonds served with raisins make an excellent dessert.\r\n\r\nBOILED CHESTNUTS.--The large variety, knows as the Italian\r\nchestnut, is best for this purpose. Remove the shells, drop into boiling\r\nwater, and boil for ten minutes, take out, drop into cold water, and rub\r\noff the brown skin. Have some clean water boiling, turn the blanched\r\nnuts into it, and cook until they can be pierced with a fork. Drain\r\nthoroughly, put into a hot dish, dry in the oven for a few minutes, and\r\nserve. A cream sauce or tomato sauce may be served with them if liked.\r\n\r\nMASHED CHESTNUTS.--Prepare and boil the chestnuts as in the\r\npreceding recipe. When tender, mash through a colander with a potato\r\nmasher. Season with cream and salt if desired. Serve hot.\r\n\r\nTO KEEP NUTS FRESH.--Chestnuts and other thin-shelled nuts may be\r\nkept from becoming too dry by mixing with an equal bulk of dry sand and\r\nstoring in a box or barrel in some cool place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE TOPICS.\r\n\r\n    Who lives to eat, will die by eating.--_Sel._\r\n\r\n    Fruit bears the closest relation to light.

Indeed, when mature, they contain a larger\r\nproportion of nitrogenous matter than any other food, either animal or\r\nvegetable. In their immature state, they more nearly resemble the\r\nvegetables. On account of the excess of nitrogenous elements in their\r\ncomposition, the mature legumes are well adapted to serve as a\r\nsubstitute for animal foods, and for use in association with articles in\r\nwhich starch or other non-nitrogenous elements are predominant; as, for\r\nexample, beans or lentils with rice, which combinations constitute the\r\nstaple food of large populations in India.\r\n\r\nThe nitrogenous matter of legumes is termed _legumin_, or vegetable\r\ncasein, and its resemblance to the animal casein of milk is very marked.\r\nThe Chinese make use of this fact, and manufacture cheese from peas and\r\nbeans. The legumes were largely used as food by the ancient nations of\r\nthe East. They were the \"pulse\" upon which the Hebrew children grew so\r\nfair and strong. According to Josephus, legumes also formed the chief\r\ndiet of the builders of the pyramids. They are particularly valuable as\r\nstrength producers, and frequently form a considerable portion of the\r\ndiet of persons in training as athletes, at the present day. Being foods\r\npossessed of such high nutritive value, the legumes are deserving of a\r\nmore extended use than is generally accorded them in this country. In\r\ntheir mature state they are, with the exception of beans, seldom found\r\nupon the ordinary bill of fare, and beans are too generally served in a\r\nform quite difficult of digestion, being combined with large quantities\r\nof fat, or otherwise improperly prepared. Peas and lentils are in some\r\nrespects superior to beans, being less liable to disagree with persons\r\nof weak digestion, and for this reason better suited to form a staple\r\narticle of diet.\r\n\r\nAll the legumes are covered with a tough skin, which is in itself\r\nindigestible, and which if not broken by the cooking process or by\r\nthorough mastication afterward, renders the entire seed liable to pass\r\nthrough the digestive tract undigested, since the digestive fluids\r\ncannot act upon the hard skin. Even when the skins are broken, if served\r\nwith the pulp, much of the nutritive material of the legume is wasted,\r\nbecause it is impossible for the digestive processes to free it from the\r\ncellulose material of which the skins are composed. If, then, it be\r\ndesirable to obtain from the legumes the largest amount of nutriment and\r\nin the most digestible form, they must be prepared in some manner so as\r\nto reject the skins. Persons unable to use the legumes when cooked in\r\nthe ordinary way, usually experience no difficulty whatever in digesting\r\nthem when divested of their skins. The hindrance which even the\r\npartially broken skins are to the complete digestion of the legume, is\r\nwell illustrated by the personal experiments of Prof. Strümpell, a\r\nGerman scientist, who found that of beans boiled with the skins on he\r\nwas able to digest only 60 per cent of the nitrogenous material they\r\ncontained. When, however, he reduced the same quantity of beans to a\r\nfine powder previous to cooking, he was enabled to digest 91.8 per cent\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the mature legumes are more digestible when prepared in\r\nsome manner in which the skins are rejected, was doubtless understood in\r\nearly times, for we find in a recipe of the fourteenth century,\r\ndirections given \"to dry legumes in an oven and remove the skins away\r\nbefore using them.\"\r\n\r\nThe green legumes which are more like a succulent vegetable are easily\r\ndigested with the skins on, if the hulls are broken before being\r\nswallowed. There are also some kinds of beans which, in their mature\r\nstate, from having thinner skins, are more readily digested, as the\r\nHaricot variety.\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS FOR COOKING.--The legumes are best cooked by stewing or\r\nboiling, and when mature, require prolonged cooking to render them\r\ntender and digestible. Slow cooking, when practicable, is preferable.\r\nDry beans and peas are more readily softened by cooking if first soaked\r\nfor a time in cold water. The soaking also has a tendency to loosen the\r\nskins, so that when boiled or stewed, a considerable portion of them\r\nslip off whole, and being lighter, rise to the top during the cooking,\r\nand can be removed with a spoon; it likewise aids in removing the strong\r\nflavor characteristic of these foods, which is considered objectionable\r\nby some persons. The length of time required for soaking will depend\r\nupon the age of the seed, those from the last harvest needing only a few\r\nhours, while such as have been kept for two or more years require to be\r\nsoaked twelve or twenty-four hours. For cooking, soft water is best. The\r\nmineral elements in hard water have a tendency to harden the casein, of\r\nwhich the legumes a largely composed, thus rendering it often very\r\ndifficult to soften them.\r\n\r\nThe dry, unsoaked legumes are generally best put to cook in cold water,\r\nand after the boiling point is reached, allowed to simmer gently until\r\ndone. Boiling water may be used for legumes which have been previously\r\nsoaked. The amount of water required will vary somewhat with the heat\r\nemployed and the age and condition of the legume, as will also the time\r\nrequired for cooking, but as a general rule two quarts of soft water\r\nfor one pint of seeds will be quite sufficient. Salt should not be added\r\nuntil the seeds are nearly done, as it hinders the cooking process.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEAS.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--The common garden pea is probably a native of\r\ncountries bordering on the Black Sea. A variety known as the gray pea\r\n(_pois chiche_) has been used since a very remote period. The common\r\npeople of Greece and Rome, in ancient times made it an ordinary article\r\nof diet. It is said that peas were considered such a delicacy by the\r\nRomans that those who coveted public favor distributed them gratuitously\r\nto the people in order to buy votes.\r\n\r\nPeas were introduced into England from Holland in the time of Elizabeth,\r\nand were then considered a great delicacy. History tells us that when\r\nthe queen was released from her confinement in the tower, May 19, 1554,\r\nshe went to Staining to perform her devotions in the church of\r\nAllhallows, after which she dined at a neighboring inn upon a meal of\r\nwhich the principal dish was boiled peas. A dinner of the same kind,\r\ncommemorative of the event, was for a long time given annually at the\r\nsame tavern.\r\n\r\nPeas, when young, are tender and sweet, containing a considerable\r\nquantity of sugar. The nitrogenous matter entering into their\r\ncomposition, although less in quantity when unripe, is much more easily\r\ndigested than when the seeds are mature.\r\n\r\nWhen quite ripe, like other leguminous seeds, they require long cooking.\r\nWhen very old, no amount of boiling will soften them. When green, peas\r\nare usually cooked and served as a vegetable; in their dried state, they\r\nare put to almost every variety of use in the different countries where\r\nthey are cultivated.\r\n\r\nIn the southeast of Scotland, a favorite food is made of ground peas\r\nprepared in thick cakes and called peas-bainocks.\r\n\r\nIn India and southern Europe, a variety of the pea is eaten parched or\r\nlightly roasted, or made into cakes, puddings, and sweetmeats. In\r\nGermany, in combination with other ingredients, peas are compounded into\r\nsausages, which, during the Franco-Prussian war, served as rations for\r\nthe soldiers.\r\n\r\nDried peas for culinary use are obtainable in two forms; the split peas,\r\nwhich have had the tough envelope of the seed removed, and the green or\r\nScotch peas.\r\n\r\nThe time required for cooking will vary from five to eight hours,\r\ndepending upon the age of the seed and the length of time it has been\r\nsoaked previous to cooking.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nSTEWED SPLIT PEAS.--Carefully examine and wash the peas, rejecting\r\nany imperfect or worm-eaten ones. Put into cold water and let them come\r\nto a boil; then place the stewpan back on the range and simmer gently\r\nuntil tender, but not mushy. Season with salt and a little cream if\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nPEAS PUREE.--Soak a quart of Scotch peas in cold water over night.\r\nIn the morning, drain and put them to cook in boiling water. Cook slowly\r\nuntil perfectly tender, allowing them to simmer very gently toward the\r\nlast until they become as dry as possible. Put through a colander to\r\nrender them homogeneous and remove the skins. Many of the skins will be\r\nloosened and rise to the top during the cooking, and it is well to\r\nremove these with a spoon so as to make the process of rubbing through\r\nthe colander less laborious. Season with salt if desired, and a cup of\r\nthin cream. Serve hot.\r\n\r\nMASHED PEAS.--Soak and cook a quart of peas as for Peas _Puree_\r\nWhen well done, if the Scotch peas, rub through a colander to remove the\r\nskins. If the split peas are used, mash perfectly smooth with a potato\r\nmasher. Season with a teaspoonful of salt and a half cup of sweet cream,\r\nif desired. Beat well together, turn into an earthen or granite-ware\r\npudding dish, smooth the top, and bake in a moderate oven until dry and\r\nmealy throughout, and nicely browned on top. Serve hot like mashed\r\npotato, or with a tomato sauce prepared as follows: Heat a pint of\r\nstrained, stewed tomato, season lightly with salt, and when boiling,\r\nthicken with a tablespoonful of flour rubbed smooth in a little cold\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nPEAS CAKES.--Cut cold mashed peas in slices half an inch in\r\nthickness, brush lightly with cream, place on perforated tins, and brown\r\nin the oven. If the peas crumble too much to slice, form them into small\r\ncakes with a spoon or knife, and brown as directed. Serve hot with or\r\nwithout a tomato sauce. A celery sauce prepared as directed in the\r\nchapter on Sauces, is also excellent.\r\n\r\nDRIED GREEN PEAS.--Gather peas while young and tender and carefully\r\ndry them. When needed for use, rinse well, and put to cook in cold\r\nwater. Let them simmer until tender. Season with cream the same as fresh\r\ngreen peas.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEANS.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--Some variety of the bean family has been cultivated\r\nand used for culinary purposes from time immemorial. It is frequently\r\nmentioned in Scripture; King David considered it worthy of a place in\r\nhis dietary, and the prophet Ezekiel was instructed to mix it with the\r\nvarious grains and seeds of which he made his bread.\r\n\r\nAmong some ancient nations the bean was regarded as a type of death, and\r\nthe priests of Jupiter were forbidden to eat it, touch it, or even\r\npronounce its name. The believer in the doctrine of transmigration of\r\nsouls carefully avoided this article of food, in the fear of submitting\r\nbeloved friends to the ordeal of mastication.\r\n\r\nAt the present day there is scarcely a country in hot or temperate\r\nclimates where the bean is not cultivated and universally appreciated,\r\nboth as a green vegetable and when mature and dried.\r\n\r\nThe time required to digest boiled beans is two and one half hours, and\r\nupwards.\r\n\r\nIn their immature state, beans are prepared and cooked like other green\r\nvegetables. Dry beans may be either boiled, stewed, or baked, but\r\nwhatever the method employed, it must be very slow and prolonged. Beans\r\nto be baked should first be parboiled until tender. We mention this as a\r\nprecautionary measure lest some amateur cook, misled by the term \"bake,\"\r\nshould repeat the experiment of the little English maid whom we employed\r\nas cook while living in London, a few years ago. In ordering our dinner,\r\nwe had quite overlooked the fact that baked beans are almost wholly an\r\nAmerican dish, and failed to give any suggestions as to the best manner\r\nof preparing it. Left to her own resources, the poor girl did the best\r\nshe knew how, but her face was full of perplexity as she placed the\r\nbeans upon the table at dinner, with, \"Well, ma'am, here are the beans,\r\nbut I don't see how you are going to eat them.\" Nor did we, for she had\r\nactually baked the dry beans, and they lay there in the dish, as brown\r\nas roasted coffee berries, and as hard as bullets.\r\n\r\nBeans to be boiled or stewed do not need parboiling, although many cooks\r\nprefer to parboil them, to lessen the strong flavor which to some\r\npersons is quite objectionable.\r\n\r\nFrom one to eight hours are required to cook beans, varying with the age\r\nand variety of the seed, whether it has been soaked, and the rapidity of\r\nthe cooking process.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nBAKED BEANS.--Pick over a quart of best white beans and soak in\r\ncold water over night. Put them to cook in fresh water, and simmer\r\ngently till they are tender, but not broken. Let them be quite juicy\r\nwhen taken from the kettle. Season with salt and a teaspoonful of\r\nmolasses. Put them in a deep crock in a slow oven. Let them bake two or\r\nthree hours, or until they assume a reddish brown tinge, adding boiling\r\nwater occasionally to prevent their becoming dry. Turn, into a shallow\r\ndish, and brown nicely before sending to the table.\r\n\r\nBOILED BEANS.--Pick over some fresh, dry beans carefully, and wash\r\nthoroughly. Put into boiling water and cook gently and slowly until\r\ntender, but not broken. They should be moderately juicy when done. Serve\r\nwith lemon juice, or season with salt and a little cream as preferred.\r\n\r\nThe colored varieties, which are usually quite strong in flavor, are\r\nmade less so by parboiling for fifteen or twenty minutes and then\r\npouring the water off, adding more of boiling temperature, and cooking\r\nslowly until tender.\r\n\r\nBEANS BOILED IN A BAG.--Soak a pint of white beans over night. When\r\nready to cook, put them into a clean bag, tie up tightly, as the beans\r\nhave already swelled, and if given space to move about with the boiling\r\nof the water will become broken and mushy. Boil three or four hours.\r\nServe hot.\r\n\r\nSCALLOPED BEANS.--Soak a pint of white beans over night in cold\r\nwater. When ready to cook, put into an earthen baking dish, cover well\r\nwith new milk, and bake in a slow oven for eight or nine hours;\r\nrefilling the dish with milk as it boils away, and taking care that the\r\nbeans do not at any time get dry enough to brown over the top till they\r\nare tender. When nearly done, add salt to taste, and a half cup of\r\ncream. They may be allowed to bake till the milk is quite absorbed, and\r\nthe beans dry, or may be served when rich with juice, according to\r\ntaste. The beans may be parboiled in water for a half hour before\r\nbeginning to bake, and the length of time thereby lessened. They should\r\nbe well drained before adding the milk, however.\r\n\r\nSTEWED BEANS.--Soak a quart of white beans in water over night. In\r\nthe morning drain, turn hot water over them an inch deep or more, cover,\r\nand place on the range where they will only just simmer, adding boiling\r\nwater if needed. When nearly tender, add salt to taste, a tablespoonful\r\nof sugar if desired, and half a cup of good sweet cream. Cook slowly an\r\nhour or more longer, but let them be full of juice when taken up, never\r\ncooked down dry and mealy.\r\n\r\nMASHED BEANS.--Soak over night in cold water, a quart of nice white\r\nbeans. When ready to cook, drain, put into boiling water, and boil till\r\nperfectly tender, and the water nearly evaporated. Take up, rub through\r\na colander to remove the skins, season with salt and a half cup of\r\ncream, put in a shallow pudding dish, smooth the top with a spoon, and\r\nbrown in the oven.\r\n\r\nSTEWED LIMA BEANS.--Put the beans into boiling water, and cook till\r\ntender, but not till they fall to pieces. Fresh beans should cook an\r\nhour or more, and dry ones require from two to three hours unless\r\npreviously soaked. They are much better to simmer slowly than to boil\r\nhard. They should be cooked nearly dry. Season with salt, and a cup of\r\nthin cream, to each pint of beans. Simmer for a few minutes after the\r\ncream is turned in. Should it happen that the beans become tender before\r\nthe water is sufficiently evaporated, do not drain off the water, but\r\nadd a little thicker cream, and thicken the whole with a little flour. A\r\nlittle flour stirred in with the cream, even when the water is nearly\r\nevaporated may be preferred by some.\r\n\r\nSUCCOTASH.--Boil one part Lima beans and two parts sweet corn\r\nseparately until both are nearly tender. Put them together, and simmer\r\ngently till done. Season with salt and sweet cream. Fresh corn and beans\r\nmay be combined in the same proportions, but as the beans will be likely\r\nto require the most time for cooking, they should be put to boil first,\r\nand the corn added when the beans are about half done, unless it is\r\nexceptionally hard, in which case it must be added sooner.\r\n\r\nPULP SUCCOTASH.--Score the kernels of some fresh green corn with a\r\nsharp knife blade, then with the back of a knife scrape out all the\r\npulp, leaving the hulls on the cob. Boil the pulp in milk ten or fifteen\r\nminutes, or until well done. Cook some fresh shelled beans until tender,\r\nand rub them through a colander. Put together an equal quantity of the\r\nbeans thus prepared and the cooked corn pulp, season with salt and\r\nsweet cream, boil together for a few minutes, and serve. Kornlet and\r\ndried Lima beans may be made into succotash in a similar manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n_LENTILS._\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--Several varieties of the lentil are cultivated for\r\nfood, but all are nearly alike in composition and nutritive value. They\r\nhave long been esteemed as an article of diet. That they were in\r\nordinary use among the Hebrews is shown by the frequent mention of them\r\nin Scripture. It is thought that the red pottage of Esau was made from\r\nthe red variety of this legume.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Egyptians believed that a diet of lentils would tend to make\r\ntheir children good tempered, cheerful, and wise, and for this reason\r\nconstituted it their principal food. A gravy made of lentils is largely\r\nused with their rice by the natives of India, at the present day.\r\n\r\nThe meal which lentils yield is of great richness, and generally\r\ncontains more casein than either beans or peas. The skin, however, is\r\ntough and indigestible, and being much smaller than peas, when served\r\nwithout rejecting the skins, they appear to be almost wholly of tough,\r\nfibrous material; hence they are of little value except for soups,\r\n_purees_, toasts, and other such dishes as require the rejection of the\r\nskin. Lentils have a stronger flavor than any of the other legumes, and\r\ntheir taste is not so generally liked until one has become accustomed to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nLentils are prepared and cooked in the same manner as dried peas, though\r\nthey require somewhat less time for cooking.\r\n\r\nThe large dark variety is better soaked for a time previous to cooking,\r\nor parboiled for a half hour and then put into new water, to make them\r\nless strong in flavor and less dark in color.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nLENTIL PUREE.--Cook the lentils and rub through a colander as for\r\npeas _puree_. Season, and serve in the same manner.\r\n\r\nLENTILS MASHED WITH BEANS.--Lentils may be cooked and prepared in\r\nthe same manner as directed for mashed peas, but they are less strong in\r\nflavor if about one third to one half cooked white beans are used with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nLENTIL GRAVY WITH RICE.--Rub a cupful of cooked lentils through a\r\ncolander to remove the skins, add one cup of rich milk, part cream if it\r\ncan be afforded, and salt if desired. Heat to boiling, and thicken with\r\na teaspoonful of flour rubbed smooth in a little cold milk. Serve hot on\r\nnicely steamed or boiled rice, or with well cooked macaroni.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE TOPICS.\r\n\r\n    The men who kept alive the flame of learning and piety in the Middle\r\n    Ages were mainly vegetarians.--_Sir William Axon._\r\n\r\n    According to Xenophon, Cyrus, king of Persia, was brought up on a\r\n    diet of water, bread, and cresses, till his fifteenth year, when\r\n    honey and raisins were added; and the family names of Fabii and\r\n    Lentuli were derived from their customary diet.\r\n\r\n    Thomson, in his poem, \"The Seasons,\" written one hundred and sixty\r\n    years ago, pays the following tribute to a diet composed of seeds\r\n    and vegetable\r\nproducts:--#/\r\n\r\n    \"With such a liberal hand has Nature flung\r\n    These seeds abroad, blown them about in winds-- ...\r\n    But who their virtues can declare? who pierce,\r\n    With vision pure, into those secret stores\r\n    Of health and life and joy--the food of man,\r\n    While yet he lived in innocence and told\r\n    A length of golden years, unfleshed in blood?\r\n    A stranger to the savage arts of life--\r\n    Death, rapine, carnage, surfeit, and disease--\r\n    The _lord_, and not the _tyrant_ of the world.\"\r\n\r\n    Most assuredly I do believe that body and mind are much influenced\r\n    by the kind of food habitually depended upon. I can never stray\r\n    among the village people of our windy capes without now and then\r\n    coming upon a human being who looks as if he had been split, salted,\r\n    and dried, like the salt fish which has built up his arid organism.\r\n    If the body is modified by the food which nourishes it, the mind and\r\n    character very certainly will be modified by it also. We know enough\r\n    of their close connection with each other to be sure of what without\r\n    any statistical observation to prove it.--_Oliver Wendell Holmes._\r\n\r\n    The thoughts and feelings which the food we partake of provokes, are\r\n    not remarked in common life, but they, nevertheless, have their\r\n    significance. A man who daily sees cows and calves slaughtered, or\r\n    who kills them himself, hogs \"stuck,\" hens \"plucked,\" etc., cannot\r\n    possibly retain any true feeling for the sufferings of his own\r\n    species....Doubtless, the majority of flesh-eaters do not reflect\r\n    upon the manner in which this food comes to them, but this\r\n    thoughtlessness, far from being a virtue, is the parent of many\r\n    vices....How very different are the thoughts and sentiments produced\r\n    by the non-flesh diet!--_Gustav Von Struve._\r\n\r\n    That the popular idea that beef is necessary for strength is not a\r\n    correct one, is well illustrated by Xenophon's description of the\r\n    outfit of a Spartan soldier, whose dietary consisted of the very\r\n    plainest and simplest vegetable fare. The complete accoutrements of\r\n    the Spartan soldier, in what we would call heavy marching order,\r\n    weighed seventy-five pounds, exclusive of the camp, mining, and\r\n    bridge-building tools and the rations of bread and dried fruit which\r\n    were issued in weekly installments, and increased the burden of the\r\n    infantry soldier to ninety, ninety-five, or even to a full hundred\r\n    pounds. This load was often carried at the rate of four miles an\r\n    hour for twelve hours _per diem_, day after day, and only when in\r\n    the burning deserts of southern Syria did the commander of the\r\n    Grecian auxiliaries think prudent to shorten the usual length of the\r\n    day's march.\r\n\r\n    DIET OF TRAINERS.--The following are a few of the restrictions and\r\n    rules laid down by experienced trainers:--\r\n\r\n    Little salt. No course vegetables. No pork or veal. Two meals a day;\r\n    breakfast at eight and dinner at two. No fat meat is allowed, no\r\n    butter or cheese, pies or pastry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLES\r\n\r\nVegetables used for culinary purposes comprise roots and tubers, as\r\npotatoes, turnips, etc.; shoots and stems, as asparagus and sea-kale;\r\nleaves and inflorescence, as spinach and cabbage; immature seeds,\r\ngrains, and seed receptacles, as green peas, corn, and string-beans; and\r\na few of the fruity products, as the tomato and the squash. Of these the\r\ntubers rank the highest in nutritive value.\r\n\r\nVegetables are by no means the most nutritious diet, as water enters\r\nlargely into their composition; but food to supply perfectly the needs\r\nof the vital economy, must contain water and indigestible as well as\r\nnutritive elements. Thus they are dietetically of great value, since\r\nthey furnish a large quantity of organic fluids. Vegetables are rich in\r\nmineral elements, and are also of service in giving bulk to food. An\r\nexclusive diet of vegetables, however, would give too great bulk, and at\r\nthe same time fail to supply the proper amount of food elements. To\r\nfurnish the requisite amount of nitrogenous material for one day, if\r\npotatoes alone were depended upon as food, a person would need to\r\nconsume about nine pounds; of turnips, sixteen pounds; of parsnips,\r\neighteen pounds; of cabbage, twenty-two pounds. Hence it is wise to use\r\nthem in combination with other articles of diet--grains, whole-wheat\r\nbread, etc.--that supplement the qualities lacking in the vegetables.\r\n\r\nTO SELECT VEGETABLES.--All roots and tubers should be plump, free\r\nfrom decay, bruises, and disease, and with fresh, unshriveled skins.\r\nThey are good from the time of maturing until they begin to germinate.\r\nSprouted vegetables are unfit for food. Potato sprouts contain a poison\r\nallied to belladonna. All vegetables beginning to decay are unfit for\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nGreen vegetables to be wholesome should be freshly gathered, crisp, and\r\njuicy; those which have lain long in the market are very questionable\r\nfood. In Paris, a law forbids a market-man to offer for sale any green\r\nvegetable kept more than one day. The use of stale vegetables is known\r\nto have been the cause of serious illness.\r\n\r\nKEEPING VEGETABLES.--If necessary to keep green vegetables for any\r\nlength of time, do not put them in water, as that will dissolve and\r\ndestroy some of their juices; but lay them in a cool, dark place,--on a\r\nstone floor is best,--and do not remove their outer leaves until needed.\r\nThey should be cooked the day they are gathered, if possible. The best\r\nway to freshen those with the stems when withered is to cut off a bit of\r\nthe stem or stem-end, and set only the cut part in water. The vegetables\r\nwill then absorb enough water to replace what has been lost by\r\nevaporation.\r\n\r\nPeas and beans should not be shelled until wanted. If, however, they are\r\nnot used as soon as shelled, cover them with pods and put in a cool\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nWinter vegetables can be best kept wholesome by storing in a cool, dry\r\nplace of even temperature, and where neither warmth, moisture, nor light\r\nis present to induce decay or germination. They should be well sorted,\r\nthe bruised or decayed, rejected, and the rest put into clean bins or\r\nboxes; and should be dry and clean when stored. Vegetables soon absorb\r\nbad flavors if left near anything odorous or decomposing, and are thus\r\nrendered unwholesome. They should be looked over often, and decayed ones\r\nremoved. Vegetables, to be kept fit for food, should on no account be\r\nstored in a cellar with barrels of fermenting pickle brine, soft soap,\r\nheaps of decomposing rubbish, and other similar things frequently found\r\nin the dark, damp vegetable cellars of modern houses.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION AND COOKING.--Most vegetables need thorough washing\r\nbefore cooking. Roots and tubers should be well cleaned before paring. A\r\nvegetable brush or a small whisk broom is especially serviceable for\r\nthis purpose. If necessary to wash shelled beans and peas, it can best\r\nbe accomplished by putting them in a colander and dipping in and out of\r\nlarge pans of water until clean. Spinach, lettuce, and other leaves may\r\nbe cleaned the same way.\r\n\r\nVegetables admit of much variety in preparation for the table, and are\r\ncommonly held to require the least culinary skill of any article of\r\ndiet. This is a mistake. Though the usual processes employed to make\r\nvegetables palatable are simple, yet many cooks, from carelessness or\r\nlack of knowledge of their nature and composition, convert some of the\r\nmost nutritious vegetables into dishes almost worthless as food or\r\nalmost impossible of digestion. It requires no little care and skill to\r\ncook vegetables so that they will neither be underdone nor overdone, and\r\nso that they will retain their natural flavors.\r\n\r\nA general rule, applicable to all vegetables to be boiled or stewed, is\r\nto cook them in as little water as may be without burning. The salts and\r\nnutrient juices are largely lost in the water; and if this needs to be\r\ndrained off, much of the nutriment is apt to be wasted. Many cooks throw\r\naway the true richness, while they serve the \"husks\" only. Condiments\r\nand seasonings may cover insipid taste, but they cannot restore lost\r\nelements. Vegetables contain so much water in their composition that it\r\nis not necessary to add large quantities for cooking, as in the case of\r\nthe grains and legumes, which have lost nearly all their moisture in the\r\nripening process. Some vegetables are much better cooked without the\r\naddition of water.\r\n\r\nVegetables to be cooked by boiling should be put into boiling water; and\r\nsince water loses its goodness by boiling, vegetables should be put in\r\nas soon as the boiling begins. The process of cooking should be\r\ncontinuous, and in general gentle heat is best. Remember that when water\r\nis boiling, the temperature is not increased by violent bubbling. Keep\r\nthe cooking utensil closely covered. If water is added, let it also be\r\nboiling hot.\r\n\r\nVegetables not of uniform size should be so assorted that those of the\r\nsame size may be cooked together, or large ones may be divided. Green\r\nvegetables retain their color best if cook rapidly. Soda is sometimes\r\nadded to the water in which the vegetables are cooked, for the purpose\r\nof preserving their colors, but this practice is very harmful.\r\n\r\nVegetables should be cooked until they are perfectly tender but not\r\noverdone. Many cooks spoil their vegetables by cooking them too long,\r\nwhile quite as many more serve them in an underdone state to preserve\r\ntheir form. Either plan makes them less palatable, and likely to be\r\nindigestible.\r\n\r\nSteaming or baking is preferable for most vegetables, because their\r\nfiner flavors are more easily retained, and their food value suffers\r\nless diminution. Particularly is this true of tubers.\r\n\r\nThe time required for cooking depends much upon the age and freshness of\r\nthe vegetables, as well as the method of cooking employed. Wilted\r\nvegetables require a longer time for cooking than fresh ones.\r\n\r\nTIME REQUIRED FOR COOKING.--The following is the approximate length\r\nof time required for cooking some of the more commonly used\r\nvegetables:--\r\n\r\nPotatoes, baked, 30 to 45 minutes.\r\n\r\nPotatoes, steamed, 20 to 40 minutes.\r\n\r\nPotatoes, boiled (in jackets), 20 to 25 minutes after the water is\r\nfairly boiling.\r\n\r\nPotatoes, pared, about 20 minutes if of medium size; if very large, they\r\nwill require from 25 to 45 minutes.\r\n\r\nGreen corn, young, from 15 to 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nPeas, 25 to 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nAsparagus, 15 to 20 minutes, young; 30 to 50 if old.\r\n\r\nTomatoes, 1 to 2 hours.\r\n\r\nString beans and shelled beans, 45 to 60 minutes or longer.\r\n\r\nBeets, boiled, 1 hour if young; old, 3 to 5 hours.\r\n\r\nBeets, baked, 3 to 6 hours. Carrots, 1 to 2 hours.\r\n\r\nParsnips, 45 minutes, young; old, 1 to 2 hours.\r\n\r\nTurnips, young, 45 minutes; old, 1-1/2 to 2 hours.\r\n\r\nWinter squash, 1 hour. Cabbage, young, 1 hour; old, 2 to 3 hours.\r\n\r\nVegetable oysters, 1 to 2 hours.\r\n\r\nCelery, 20 to 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nSpinach, 20 to 60 minutes or more.\r\n\r\nCauliflower, 20 to 40 minutes.\r\n\r\nSummer squash, 20 to 60 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf vegetables after being cooked cannot be served at once, dish them up\r\nas soon as done, and place the dishes in a _bain marie_ or in pans of\r\nhot water, where they will keep of even temperature, but not boil.\r\nVegetables are never so good after standing, but they spoil less kept in\r\nthis way than any other. The water in the pans should be of equal depth\r\nwith the food in the dishes. Stewed vegetables and others prepared with\r\na sauce, may, when cold, be reheated in a similar manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bain Marie.]\r\n\r\nIf salt is to be used to season, one third of a teaspoonful for each\r\npint of cooked vegetables is an ample quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IRISH POTATO.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--The potato, a plant of the order _Solanaceae_, is\r\nsupposed to be indigenous to South America. Probably it was introduced\r\ninto Europe by the Spaniards early in the sixteenth century, but\r\ncultivated only as a curiosity. To Sir Walter Raleigh, however, is\r\nusually given the credit of its introduction as a food, he having\r\nimported it from Virginia to Ireland in 1586, where its valuable\r\nnutritive qualities were first appreciated. The potato has so long\r\nconstituted the staple article of diet in Ireland, that it has come to\r\nbe commonly, though incorrectly, known as the Irish potato.\r\n\r\nThe edible portion of the plant is the tuber, a thick, fleshy mass or\r\nenlarged portion of an underground stem, having upon its surface a\r\nnumber of little buds, or \"eyes,\" each capable of independent growth.\r\nThe tuber is made up of little cells filled with starch granules,\r\nsurrounded and permeated with a watery fluid containing a small\r\npercentage of the albuminous or nitrogenous elements. In cooking, heat\r\ncoagulates the albumen within and between the cells, while the starch\r\ngranules absorb the watery portion, swell, and distend the cells. The\r\ncohesion between these is also destroyed, and they easily separate. When\r\nthese changes are complete, the potato becomes a loose, farinaceous\r\nmass, or \"mealy.\" When, however, the liquid portion is not wholly\r\nabsorbed, and the cells are but imperfectly separated, the potato\r\nappears waxen, watery, or soggy. In a mealy state the potato is easily\r\ndigested; but when waxy or water-soaked, it is exceedingly trying to the\r\ndigestive powers.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, then, that the great _desideratum_ in cooking the potato,\r\nis to promote the expansion and separation of its cells; in other words,\r\nto render it mealy. Young potatoes are always waxy, and consequently\r\nless wholesome than ripe ones. Potatoes which have been frozen and\r\nallowed to thaw quickly are much sweeter and more watery, because in\r\nthawing the starch changes into sugar. Frozen potatoes should be thawed\r\nin cold water and cooked at once, or kept frozen until ready for use.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION AND COOKING.--Always pare potatoes very thin. Much of\r\nthe most nutritious part of the tuber lies next its outer covering; so\r\ncare should be taken to waste as little as possible. Potatoes cooked\r\nwith the skins on are undoubtedly better than those pared. The chief\r\nmineral element contained in the potato is potash, an important\r\nconstituent of the blood. Potash salts are freely soluble in water, and\r\nwhen the skin is removed, there is nothing to prevent these salts from\r\nescaping into the water in which the potato is boiled. If the potato is\r\ncooked in its \"jacket,\" the skin, which does not in general burst open\r\nuntil the potato is nearly done, serves to keep this valuable element\r\nlargely inside the potato while cooking. For the same reason it is\r\nbetter not to pare potatoes and put them in water to soak over night, as\r\nmany cooks are in the habit of doing, to have them in readiness for\r\ncooking for breakfast.\r\n\r\nPotatoes to be pared should be first washed and dried. It is a good plan\r\nto wash quite a quantity at one time, to be used as needed. After\r\nparing, drop at once into cold water and rinse them thoroughly. It is a\r\ncareless habit to allow pared potatoes to fall among the skins, as in\r\nthis way they become stained, and appear black and discolored after\r\ncooking. Scrubbing with a vegetable brush is by far the best means for\r\ncleaning potatoes to be cooked with the skins on.\r\n\r\nWhen boiled in their skins, the waste, according to Letheby, is about\r\nthree per cent, while without them it is not less than fourteen per\r\ncent, or more than two ounces in every pound. Potatoes boiled without\r\nskins should be cooked very gently.\r\n\r\nSteaming, roasting, and baking are much better methods for cooking\r\npotatoes than boiling, for reasons already given. Very old potatoes are\r\nbest stewed or mashed. When withered or wilted, they are freshened by\r\nstanding in cold water for an hour or so before cooking. If diseased or\r\nbadly sprouted, potatoes are wholly unfit for food.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nBOILED POTATOES (IN JACKETS).--Choose potatoes of uniform size,\r\nfree from specks. Wash and scrub them well with a coarse cloth or brush;\r\ndig out all eyes and rinse in cold water; cook in just enough water to\r\nprevent burning, till easily pierced with a fork, not till they have\r\nburst the skin and fallen in pieces. Drain thoroughly, take out the\r\npotatoes, and place them in the oven for five minutes, or place the\r\nkettle back on the range; remove the skins, and cover with a cloth to\r\nabsorb all moisture, and let them steam three or four minutes. By either\r\nmethod they will be dry and mealy. In removing the skins, draw them off\r\nwithout cutting the potatoes.\r\n\r\nBOILED POTATOES (WITHOUT SKINS).--Pare very thin, and wash clean.\r\nIf not of an equal size, cut the larger potatoes in two. Cook in only\r\nsufficient water to prevent burning until a fork will easily pierce\r\ntheir center; drain thoroughly, place the kettle back on the range,\r\ncover with a cloth to absorb the moisture, and let them dry four or five\r\nminutes. Shake the kettle several times while they are drying, to make\r\nthem floury.\r\n\r\nSTEAMED POTATOES.--Potatoes may be steamed either with or without\r\nthe skin. Only mature potatoes can be steamed. Prepare as for boiling;\r\nplace in a steamer, over boiling water, and steam until tender. If water\r\nis needed to replenish, let it always be boiling hot, and not allow the\r\npotatoes to stop steaming, or they will be watery. When done, uncover,\r\nremove the potatoes to the oven, and let them dry a few minutes. If\r\npeeled before steaming, shake the steamer occasionally, to make them\r\nfloury.\r\n\r\nROASTED POTATOES.--Potatoes are much more rich and mealy roasted\r\nthan cooked in any other way. Wash them very carefully, dry with a\r\ncloth, and wrap in tissue paper; bury in ashes not too hot, then cover\r\nwith coals and roast until tender. The coals will need renewing\r\noccasionally, unless the roasting is done very close to the main fire.\r\n\r\nBAKED POTATOES.--Choose large, smooth potatoes as near the same\r\nsize as possible; wash and scrub with a brush until perfectly clean; dry\r\nwith a cloth, and bake in a moderately hot oven until a fork will easily\r\npierce them, or until they yield to pressure between the fingers. They\r\nare better turned about occasionally. In a slow oven the skins become\r\nhardened and thickened, and much of the most nutritious portion is\r\nwasted. When done, press each one till it bursts slightly, as that will\r\nallow the steam to escape, and prevent the potatoes from becoming soggy.\r\nThey should be served at once, in a folded napkin placed in a hot dish.\r\nCold baked potatoes may be warmed over by rebaking, if of good quality\r\nand not overdone the first time.\r\n\r\nSTUFFED POTATO.--Prepare and bake large potatoes of equal size, as\r\ndirected in the preceding recipe. When done, cut them evenly three\r\nfourths of an inch from the end, and scrape out the inside, taking care\r\nnot to break the skins. Season the potato with salt and a little thick\r\nsweet cream, being careful not to have it too moist, and beat thoroughly\r\nwith a fork until light; refill the skins with the seasoned potato, fit\r\nthe broken portions together, and reheat in the oven. When hot\r\nthroughout, wrap the potatoes in squares of white tissue paper fringed\r\nat both ends. Twist the ends of the paper lightly together above the\r\nfringe, and stand the potatoes in a vegetable dish with the cut end\r\nuppermost. When served, the potatoes are held in the hand, one end of\r\nthe paper untwisted, the top of the potato removed, and the contents\r\neaten with a fork or spoon.\r\n\r\nSTUFFED POTATOES NO. 2.--Prepare large, smooth potatoes, bake until\r\ntender, and cut them in halves; scrape out the inside carefully, so as\r\nnot to break the skins; mash smoothly, mix thoroughly with one third\r\nfreshly prepared cottage cheese; season with nice sweet cream, and salt\r\nif desired. Fill the shells with the mixture, place cut side uppermost,\r\nin a pudding dish, and brown in the oven.\r\n\r\nMASHED POTATOES.--Peel and slice potatoes enough to make two\r\nquarts; put into boiling water and cook until perfectly tender, but not\r\nmuch broken; drain, add salt to taste; turn into a hot earthen dish, and\r\nset in the oven for a few moments to dry. Break up the potatoes with a\r\nsilver fork; add nearly a cup of cream, and beat hard at least five\r\nminutes till light and creamy; serve at once, or they will become heavy.\r\nIf preferred, the potatoes may be rubbed through a hot sieve into a hot\r\nplate, or mashed with a potato beetle, but they are less light and flaky\r\nwhen mashed with a beetle. If cream for seasoning is not obtainable, a\r\nwell-beaten egg makes a very good substitute. Use in the proportion of\r\none egg to about five potatoes. For mashed potatoes, if all utensils and\r\ningredients are first heated, the result will be much better.\r\n\r\nNEW POTATOES.--When potatoes are young and freshly gathered, the\r\nskins are easiest removed by taking each one in a coarse cloth and\r\nrubbing it; a little coarse salt used in the cloth will be found\r\nserviceable for this purpose. If almost ripe, scrape with a blunt knife,\r\nwash very clean, and rinse in cold water. Boiling is the best method of\r\ncooking; new potatoes are not good steamed. Use only sufficient water to\r\ncover, and boil till tender. Drain thoroughly, cover closely with a\r\nclean cloth, and dry before serving.\r\n\r\nCRACKED POTATOES.--Prepare and boil new potatoes as in the\r\npreceding recipe, and when ready to serve, crack each by pressing\r\nlightly upon it with the back of a spoon, lay them in a hot dish, salt\r\nto taste, and pour over them a cup of hot thin cream or rich milk.\r\n\r\nCREAMED POTATOES.--Take rather small, new potatoes and wash well;\r\nrub off all the skins; cut in halves, or if quite large, quarter them.\r\nPut a pint of divided potatoes into a broad-bottomed, shallow saucepan;\r\npour over them a cup of thin sweet cream, add salt if desired; heat just\r\nto the boiling point, then allow them to simmer gently till perfectly\r\ntender, tossing them occasionally in the stewpan to prevent their\r\nburning on the bottom. Serve hot.\r\n\r\nSCALLOPED POTATOES.--Pare the potatoes and slice thin; put them in\r\nlayers in an earthen pudding dish, dredge each layer lightly with flour,\r\nand salt, and pour over all enough good, rich milk to cover well. Cover,\r\nand bake rather slowly till tender, removing the cover just long enough\r\nbefore the potatoes are done, to brown nicely. If preferred, a little\r\nless milk may be used, and a cup of thin cream added when the potatoes\r\nare nearly done.\r\n\r\nSTEWED POTATO.--Pare the potatoes and slice rather thin. Put into\r\nboiling water, and cook until nearly tender, but not broken. Have some\r\nrich milk boiling in the inner dish of a double boiler, add to it a\r\nlittle salt, then stir in for each pint of milk a heaping teaspoonful of\r\ncorn starch or rice flour, rubbed smooth in a little cold milk. Stir\r\nuntil it thickens. Drain the potatoes, turn them into the hot sauce, put\r\nthe dish in the outer boiler, and cook for a half hour or longer. Cold\r\nboiled potatoes may be sliced and used in the same way. Cold baked\r\npotatoes sliced and stewed thus for an hour or more, make a particularly\r\nappetizing dish.\r\n\r\nPOTATOES STEWED WITH CELERY.--Pare and slice the potatoes, and put\r\nthem into a stewpan with two or three tablespoonfuls of minced celery.\r\nUse only the white part of the celery and mince it finely. Cover the\r\nwhole with milk sufficient to cook and prevent burning, and stew until\r\ntender. Season with cream and salt.\r\n\r\nPOTATO SNOWBALLS.--Cut largo potatoes into quarters; if small,\r\nleave them undivided; boil in just enough water to cover. When tender,\r\ndrain and dry in the usual way. Take up two or three pieces at a time in\r\na strong, clean cloth, and press them compactly together in the shape of\r\nballs. Serve in a folded napkin on a hot dish.\r\n\r\nPOTATO CAKES.--Make nicely seasoned, cold mashed potato into small\r\nround cakes about one half an inch thick. Put them on a baking tin,\r\nbrush them over with sweet cream, and bake in a hot oven till golden\r\nbrown.\r\n\r\nPOTATO CAKES WITH EGG.--Bake nice potatoes till perfectly tender;\r\npeel, mash thoroughly, and to each pint allow the yolks of two eggs\r\nwhich have been boiled until mealy, then rubbed perfectly smooth through\r\na fine wire sieve, and one half cup of rich milk. Add salt to taste, mix\r\nall well together, form the potato into small cakes, place them on oiled\r\ntins, and brown ten or fifteen minutes in the oven.\r\n\r\nPOTATO PUFF.--Mix a pint of mashed potato (cold is just as good if\r\nfree from lumps) with a half cup of cream and the well-beaten yolk of an\r\negg; salt to taste and beat till smooth; lastly, stir in the white of\r\nthe egg beaten to a stiff froth. Pile up in a rocky form on a bright tin\r\ndish, and bake in a quick oven until heated throughout and lightly\r\nbrowned. Serve at once.\r\n\r\nBROWNED POTATOES.--Slice cold potatoes evenly, place them on an\r\noiled tin, and brown in a very quick oven; or slice lengthwise and lay\r\non a wire broiler or bread-toaster, and brown over hot coals. Sprinkle\r\nwith a little salt if desired, and serve hot with sweet cream as\r\ndressing.\r\n\r\nORNAMENTAL POTATOES.--No vegetable can be made palatable in so many\r\nways as the potato, and few can be arranged in such pretty shapes.\r\nMashed potatoes made moist with cream, can easily be made into cones,\r\npyramids, or mounds. Cold mashed potatoes may be cut into many fancy\r\nshapes with a cookie-cutter, wet with a little cold water, and browned\r\nin the oven.\r\n\r\nMounds of potatoes are very pretty smoothed and strewn with well-cooked\r\nvermicelli broken into small bits, and then lightly browned in the oven.\r\n\r\nScoring the top of a dish of mashed potato deeply in triangles, stars,\r\nand crosses, with the back of a carving knife, and then browning\r\nlightly, gives a very pretty effect.\r\n\r\nBROILED POTATO.--Mashed potatoes, if packed firmly while warm into\r\na sheet-iron bread tin which has been dipped in cold water, may be cut\r\ninto slices when cold, brushed with cream, and browned on a broiler over\r\nhot coals.\r\n\r\nWARMED-OVER POTATOES.--Cut cold boiled potatoes into very thin\r\nslices; heat a little cream to boiling in a saucepan; add the potato,\r\nseason lightly with salt if desired, and cook until the cream is\r\nabsorbed, stirring occasionally so as to prevent scorching or breaking\r\nthe slices.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE HASH.--With one quart finely sliced potato, chop one\r\ncarrot, one red beet, one white turnip, all boiled, also one or two\r\nstalks of celery. Put all together in a stewpan, cover closely, and set\r\nin the oven; when hot, pour over them a cup of boiling cream, stir well\r\ntogether, and serve hot.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SWEET POTATO.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--The sweet potato is a native of the Malayan\r\nArchipelago, where it formerly grew wild; thence it was taken to Spain,\r\nand from Spain to England and other parts of the globe. It was largely\r\nused in Europe as a delicacy on the tables of the rich before the\r\nintroduction of the common potato, which has now taken its place and\r\nlikewise its name. The sweet potato is the article referred as potato by\r\nShakespeare and other English writers, previous to the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION AND COOKING.--What has been said in reference to the\r\ncommon potato, is generally applicable to the sweet potato; it may be\r\nprepared and cooked in nearly all the ways of the Irish potato.\r\n\r\nIn selecting sweet potatoes, choose firm, plump roots, free from any\r\nsprouts; if sprouted they will have a poor flavor, and are likely to be\r\nwatery.\r\n\r\nThe sweet potato is best cooked with the skin on; but all discolored\r\nportions and the dry portion at each end, together with all branchlets,\r\nshould be carefully removed, and the potato well washed, and if to be\r\nbaked or roasted, well dried with a cloth before placing in the oven.\r\n\r\nThe average time required for boiling is about fifty minutes; baking,\r\none hour; steaming, about one hour; roasting, one and one half hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nBAKED SWEET POTATOES.--Select those of uniform size, wash clean,\r\ncutting out any imperfect spots, wipe dry, put into moderately hot oven,\r\nand bake about one hour, or until the largest will yield to gentle\r\npressure between the fingers. Serve at once without peeling. Small\r\npotatoes are best steamed, since if baked, the skins will take up nearly\r\nthe whole potato.\r\n\r\nBAKED SWEET POTATO NO. 2.--Select potatoes of medium size, wash and\r\ntrim but do not pare, and put on the upper grate of the oven. For a peek\r\nof potatoes, put in the lower part of the oven in a large shallow pan a\r\nhalf pint of hot water. The water may be turned directly upon the oven\r\nbottom if preferred. Bake slowly, turning once when half done. Serve in\r\ntheir skins, or peel, slice, and return to the oven until nicely\r\nbrowned.\r\n\r\nBOILED SWEET POTATOES.--Choose potatoes of equal size; do not pare,\r\nbut after cleaning them well and removing any imperfect spots, put into\r\ncold water and boll until they can be easily pierced with a fork; drain\r\nthoroughly, and lay them on the top grate in the oven to dry for five or\r\nten minutes. Peel as soon as dry, and send at once to the table, in a\r\nhot dish covered with a folded napkin. Sweet potatoes are much better\r\nbaked than boiled.\r\n\r\nSTEAMED SWEET POTATOES.--Wash the potatoes well, cut out any\r\ndiscolored portions, and steam over a kettle of boiling water until they\r\ncan be easily pierced with a fork, not allowing the water in the pot to\r\ncease boiling for a moment. Steam only sufficient to cook them, else\r\nthey will be watery.\r\n\r\nBROWNED SWEET POTATOES.--Slice cold, cooked sweet potatoes evenly,\r\nplace on slightly oiled tins in a hot oven, and brown.\r\n\r\nMASHED SWEET POTATOES.--Either bake or steam nice sweet potatoes,\r\nand when tender, peel, mash them well, and season with cream and salt to\r\ntaste. They may be served at once, or made into patties and browned in\r\nthe oven.\r\n\r\nPOTATO HASH.--Take equal parts of cold Irish and sweet potatoes;\r\nchop fine and mix thoroughly; season with salt if desired, and add\r\nsufficient thin cream to moisten well. Turn into a stewpan, and heat\r\ngently until boiling, tossing continually, that all parts become heated\r\nalike, and serve at once.\r\n\r\nROASTED SWEET POTATOES.--Wash clean and wipe dry, potatoes of\r\nuniform size, wrap with tissue paper, cover with hot ashes, and then\r\nwith coals from a hardwood fire; unless near the main fire, the coals\r\nwill need renewing a few times. This will require a longer time than by\r\nany other method, but they are much nicer. The slow, continuous heat\r\npromotes their mealiness. When tender, brush the ashes off with a broom,\r\nand wipe with a dry cloth. Send to the table in their jackets.\r\n\r\nTO DRY SWEET POTATOES.--Carefully clean and drop them into boiling\r\nwater. Let them remain until the skins can be easily slipped off; then\r\ncut into slices and spread on racks to dry. To prepare for cooking, soak\r\nover night, and boil the next day.\r\n\r\n\r\nTURNIPS.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--The turnip belongs to the order _Cruciferæ_,\r\nsignifying \"cross flowers,\" so called because their four petals are\r\narranged in the form of a cross. It is a native of Europe and the\r\ntemperate portions of Asia, growing wild in borders of fields and waste\r\nplaces. The ancient Roman gastronomists considered the turnip, when\r\nprepared in the following manner, a dish fit for epicures: \"After\r\nboiling, extract the water from them, and season with cummin, rue or\r\nbenzoin, pounded in a mortar; afterward add honey, vinegar, gravy, and\r\nboiled grapes. Allow the whole to simmer, and serve.\"\r\n\r\nUnder cultivation, the turnip forms an agreeable culinary esculent; but\r\non account of the large proportion of water entering into its\r\ncomposition, its nutritive value is exceedingly low. The Swedish, or\r\nRutabaga, variety is rather more nutritive than the white, but its\r\nstronger flavor renders it less palatable. Unlike the potato, the turnip\r\ncontains no starch, but instead, a gelatinous substance called pectose,\r\nwhich during the boiling process is changed into a vegetable jelly\r\ncalled pectine. The white lining just inside the skin is usually bitter;\r\nhence the tuber should be peeled sufficiently deep to remove it. When\r\nwell cooked, turnips are quite easily digested.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION AND COOKING.--Turnips are good for culinary purposes\r\nonly from the time of their ripening till they begin to sprout. The\r\nprocess of germination changes their proximate elements, and renders\r\nthem less fit for food. Select turnips which are plump and free from\r\ndisease. A turnip that is wilted, or that appears spongy, pithy, or\r\ncork-like when cut, is not fit for food.\r\n\r\nPrepare turnips for cooking by thoroughly washing and scraping, if young\r\nand tender, or by paring if more mature. If small, they may be cooked\r\nwhole; if large, they should be cut across the grain into slices a half\r\ninch in thickness. If cooked whole, care must be taken to select those\r\nof uniform size; and if sliced, the slices must be of equal thickness.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nBOILED TURNIPS.--Turnips, like other vegetables, should be boiled\r\nin as small an amount of water as possible. Great care must be taken,\r\nhowever, that the kettle does not get dry, as scorched turnip is\r\nspoiled. An excellent precaution, in order to keep them from scorching\r\nin case the water becomes low, is to place an inverted saucer or\r\nsauce-dish in the bottom of the kettle before putting in the turnips.\r\nPut into boiling water, cook rapidly until sufficiently tender to pierce\r\neasily with a fork; too much cooking discolors and renders them strong\r\nin flavor. Boiled turnips should be drained very thoroughly, and all\r\nwater pressed out before preparing for the table. The age, size, and\r\nvariety of the turnip will greatly vary the time necessary for its\r\ncooking. The safest rule is to allow plenty of time, and test with a\r\nfork. Young turnips will cook in about forty-five minutes; old turnips,\r\nsliced, require from one and a quarter to two hours. If whole or cut in\r\nhalves, they require a proportionate length of time. White turnips\r\nrequire much, less cooking than yellow ones.\r\n\r\nBAKED TURNIPS.--Select turnips of uniform size; wash and wipe, but\r\ndo not pare; place on the top grate of a moderately hot oven; bake two\r\nor more hours or until perfectly tender; peel and serve at once, either\r\nmashed or with cream sauce. Turnips are much sweeter baked than when\r\ncooked in any other way.\r\n\r\nCREAMED TURNIPS.--Pare, but do not cut, young sweet white turnips;\r\nboil till tender in a small quantity of water; drain and dry well. Cook\r\na tablespoonful of flour in a pint of rich milk or part cream; arrange\r\nthe turnips in a baking dish, pour the sauce over them, add salt if\r\ndesired, sprinkle the top with grated bread crumbs, and brown in a quick\r\noven.\r\n\r\nCHOPPED TURNIPS.--Chop well-boiled white turnips very fine, add\r\nsalt to taste and sufficient lemon juice to moisten. Turn into a\r\nsaucepan and heat till hot, gently lifting and stirring constantly. Cold\r\nboiled turnip may be used advantageously in this way.\r\n\r\nMASHED TURNIPS.--Wash the turnips, pare, and drop into boiling\r\nwater. Cook until perfectly tender; turn into a colander and press out\r\nthe water with a plate or large spoon; mash until free from lumps,\r\nseason with a little sweet cream, and salt if desired. If the turnips\r\nare especially watery, one or two hot, mealy potatoes mashed with them\r\nwill be an improvement.\r\n\r\nSCALLOPED TURNIPS.--Prepare and boil whole white turnips until\r\nnearly tender; cut into thin slices, lay in an earthen pudding dish,\r\npour over them a white sauce sufficient to cover, made by cooking a\r\ntablespoonful of flour in a pint of milk, part cream if preferred, until\r\nthickened. Season with salt, sprinkle the top lightly with grated bread\r\ncrumbs, and bake in a quick oven until a rich brown. Place the baking\r\ndish on a clean plate, and serve. Rich milk or cream may be used instead\r\nof white sauce, if preferred.\r\n\r\nSTEAMED TURNIPS.--Select turnips of uniform size, wash, pare, and\r\nsteam rapidly till they can be easily pierced with a fork; mash, or\r\nserve with lemon juice or cream sauce, as desired.\r\n\r\nSTEWED TURNIPS.--Prepare and slice some young, fresh white turnips,\r\nboil or steam about twenty minutes, drain thoroughly, turn into a\r\nsaucepan with a cup of new milk for each quart of turnips; simmer gently\r\nuntil tender, season with salt if desired, and serve.\r\n\r\nTURNIPS IN JUICE.--Wash young white turnips, peel, and boil whole\r\nin sufficient water to keep them from burning. Cover closely and cook\r\ngently until tender, by which time the water in the kettle should be\r\nreduced to the consistency of syrup. Serve at once.\r\n\r\nTURNIPS WITH CREAM SAUCE.--Wash and pare the turnips, cut them\r\ninto half-inch dice, and cook in boiling water until tender. Meanwhile\r\nprepare a cream sauce as directed for Scalloped Turnips, using thin\r\ncream in place of milk. Drain the turnips, pour the cream sauce over\r\nthem, let them boil up once, and serve.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARSNIPS.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--The common garden parsnip is derived by cultivation\r\nfrom the wild parsnip, indigenous to many parts of Europe and the north\r\nof Asia, and cultivated since Roman times. It is not only used for\r\nculinary purposes, but a wine is made from it. In the north of Ireland a\r\ntable beer is brewed from its fermented product and hops.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of nutritive elements contained in the parsnip is very\r\nsmall; so small, indeed, that one pound of parsnips affords hardly one\r\nfifth of an ounce of nitrogenous or muscle-forming material. The time\r\nrequired for its digestion, varies from two and one half to three and\r\none half hours.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION AND COOKING.--Wash and trim off any rough portions:\r\nscrape well with a knife to remove the skins, and drop at once into cold\r\nwater to prevent discoloration. If the parsnips are smooth-skinned,\r\nfresh, and too small to need dividing, they need only be washed\r\nthoroughly before cooking, as the skins can be easily removed by rubbing\r\nwith a clean towel. Reject those that are wilted, pithy, coarse, or\r\nstringy. Large parsnips should be divided, for if cooked whole, the\r\noutside is likely to become soft before the center is tender. They may\r\nbe either split lengthwise or sliced. Parsnips may be boiled, baked, or\r\nsteamed; but like all other vegetables containing a large percentage of\r\nwater, are preferable steamed or baked.\r\n\r\nThe time required for cooking young parsnips, is about forty-five\r\nminutes; when old, they require from one to two hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nBAKED PARSNIPS.--Wash, thoroughly, but do not scrape the roots;\r\nbake the same as potatoes. When tender, remove the skins, slice, and\r\nserve with cream or an egg sauce prepared as directed for Parsnips with\r\nEgg Sauce. They are also very nice mashed and seasoned with cream. Baked\r\nand steamed parsnips are far sweeter than boiled ones.\r\n\r\nBAKED PARSNIPS NO. 2.--Wash, scrape, and divide; drop into boiling\r\nwater, a little more than sufficient to cook them, and boil gently till\r\nthoroughly tender. There should remain about one half pint of the liquor\r\nwhen the parsnips are done. Arrange on an earthen plate or shallow\r\npudding dish, not more than one layer deep; cover with the juice, and\r\nbake, basting frequently until the juice is all absorbed, and the\r\nparsnips delicately browned. Serve at once.\r\n\r\nBOILED PARSNIPS.--Clean, scrape, drop into a small quantity of\r\nboiling water, and cook until they can be easily pierced, with a fork.\r\nDrain thoroughly, cut the parsnips in slices, and mash or serve with a\r\nwhite sauce, to which a little lemon juice may be added if desired.\r\n\r\nBROWNED PARSNIPS.--Slice cold parsnips into rather thick pieces,\r\nand brown as directed for browned potatoes.\r\n\r\nCREAMED PARSNIPS.--Bake or steam the parsnips until tender; slice,\r\nadd salt if desired, and a cup of thin sweet cream. Let them stew slowly\r\nuntil nearly dry, or if preferred, just boil up once and serve.\r\n\r\nMASHED PARSNIPS.--Wash and scrape, dropping at once into cold water\r\nto prevent discoloration. Slice thinly and steam, or bake whole until\r\nperfectly tender. When done, mash until free from lumps, removing all\r\nhard or stringy portions; add salt to taste and a few spoonfuls of thick\r\nsweet cream, and serve.\r\n\r\nPARSNIPS WITH CREAM SAUCE.--Bake as previously directed. When\r\ntender, slice, cut into cubes, and pour over them a cream sauce prepared\r\nas for Turnips with Cream Sauce. Boil up together once, and serve.\r\n\r\nPARSNIPS WITH EGG SAUCE.--Scrape, wash, and slice thinly, enough\r\nparsnips to make three pints; steam, bake, or boil them until very\r\ntender. If boiled, turn into a colander and drain well. Have ready an\r\negg sauce, for preparing which heat a pint of rich milk or very thin\r\ncream to boiling, stir into it a level tablespoonful of flour rubbed\r\nsmooth with a little milk. Let this boil a few minutes, stirring\r\nconstantly until the flour is well cooked and the sauce thickened; then\r\nadd slowly the well-beaten yolk of one egg, stirring rapidly so that it\r\nshall be well mingled with the whole; add salt to taste; let it boil up\r\nonce, pour over the parsnips, and serve. The sauce should be of the\r\nconsistency of thick cream.\r\n\r\nPARSNIPS WITH POTATOES.--Wash, scrape, and slice enough parsnips\r\nto make two and a half quarts. Pare and slice enough potatoes to make\r\none pint. Cook together in a small quantity of water. When tender, mash\r\nsmoothly, add salt, the yolks of two eggs well beaten, and a cup of rich\r\nmilk. Beat well together, put into an earthen or china dish, and brown\r\nlightly in the oven.\r\n\r\nSTEWED PARSNIPS.--Prepare and boil for a half hour; drain, cover\r\nwith rich milk, add salt if desired, and stew gently till tender.\r\n\r\nSTEWED PARSNIPS WITH CELERY.--Prepare and steam or boil some nice\r\nones until about half done. If boiled, drain thoroughly; add salt if\r\ndesired, and a tablespoonful of minced celery. Turn rich boiling milk\r\nover them, cover, and stew fifteen or twenty minutes, or till perfectly\r\ntender.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARROTS.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--The garden carrot is a cultivated variety of a plant\r\nbelonging to the _Umbettiferæ_, and grows wild in many portions of\r\nEurope. The root has long been used for food. By the ancient Greeks and\r\nRomans it was much esteemed as a salad. The carrot is said to have been\r\nintroduced into England by Flemish refugees during the reigns of\r\nElizabeth and James I. Its feathery leaves were used by the ladies as an\r\nadornment for their headdresses, in place of plumes. Carrots contain\r\nsugar enough for making a syrup from them; they also yield by\r\nfermentation and distillation a spirituous liquor. In Germany they are\r\nsometimes cut into small pieces, and roasted as a substitute for coffee.\r\n\r\nStarch does not enter into the composition of carrots, but a small\r\nportion of pectose is found instead. Carrots contain more water than\r\nparsnips, and both much cellulose and little nutritive material. Carrots\r\nwhen well cooked form a wholesome food, but one not adapted to weak\r\nstomachs, as they are rather hard to digest and tend to flatulence.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION AND COOKING.--The suggestions given for the preparation\r\nof parsnips are also applicable to carrots; and they may be boiled,\r\nsteamed, or browned in the same manner. From one to two hours time will\r\nbe required, according to age, size, variety, and method of cooking.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nBOILED CARROTS.--Clean, scrape, drop into boiling water, and cook\r\ntill tender; drain thoroughly, slice, and serve with a cream sauce.\r\nVarieties with strong flavor are better parboiled for fifteen or twenty\r\nminutes, and put into fresh boiling water to finish.\r\n\r\nCARROTS WITH EGG SAUCE.--Wash and scrape well; slice and throw into\r\nboiling water, or else steam. When tender, drain thoroughly, and pour\r\nover them a sauce prepared the same as for parsnips (page 244), with the\r\naddition of a tablespoonful of sugar. Let them boil up once, and serve.\r\n\r\nSTEWED CARROTS.--Prepare young and tender carrots, drop into\r\nboiling water, and cook for fifteen or twenty minutes. Drain, slice, and\r\nput into a stewpan with rich milk or cream nearly to cover; simmer\r\ngently until tender; season with salt and a little chopped parsley.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEETS.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--The beet is a native of the coasts of the\r\nMediterranean, and is said to owe its botanical name, _beta_, to a\r\nfancied resemblance to the Greek letter B. Two varieties are in common\r\nuse as food, the white and the red beet; while a sub-variety, the sugar\r\nbeet, is largely cultivated in France, in connection with the beet-sugar\r\nindustry in that country. The same industry has recently been introduced\r\ninto this country. It is grown extensively in Germany and Russia, for\r\nthe same pose, and is also used there in the manufacture of alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe beet root is characterized by its unusual amount of sugar. It is\r\nconsidered more nutritive than any other esculent tuber except the\r\npotato, but the time required for its digestion exceeds that of most\r\nvegetables, being three and three fourths hours.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION AND COOKING.--Beets, like other tubers, should be\r\nfresh, unshriveled, and healthy. Wash carefully, scrubbing with a soft\r\nbrush to remove all particles of dirt; but avoid scraping, cutting, or\r\nbreaking, lest the sweet juices escape. In handling for storage, be\r\ncareful not to bruise or break the skins; and in purchasing from the\r\nmarket, select only such as are perfect.\r\n\r\nBeets may be boiled, baked, or steamed. In boiling, if the skin is cut\r\nor broken, the juice will escape in the water, and the flavor will be\r\ninjured; for this reason, beets should not be punctured with a fork to\r\nfind if done. When tender, the thickest part will yield readily to\r\npressure of the fingers. Beets should be boiled in just as little water\r\nas possible, and they will be much better if it has all evaporated by\r\nthe time they are cooked.\r\n\r\nYoung beets will boil in one hour, while old beets require from three to\r\nfive hours; if tough, wilted, and stringy, they cannot be boiled tender.\r\nBaked beets require from three to six hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nBAKED BEETS.--Beets are far better baked than boiled, though it\r\ntakes a longer time to cook properly. French cooks bake them slowly six\r\nhours in a covered dish, the bottom of which is lined with\r\nwell-moistened rye straw; however, they may be baked on the oven grate,\r\nlike potatoes. Wipe dry after washing, and bake slowly. They are very\r\nnice served with a sauce made of equal quantities of lemon juice and\r\nwhipped cream, with a little salt.\r\n\r\nBAKED BEETS NO. 2.--Wash young and tender beets, and place in an\r\nearthen baking dish with a very little water; as it evaporates, add\r\nmore, which must be of boiling temperature. Set into a moderate oven,\r\nand according to size of the beets, bake slowly from two to three hours.\r\nWhen tender, remove the skins and dress with lemon juice or cream sauce.\r\n\r\nBEETS AND POTATOES.--Boil newly matured potatoes and young beets\r\nseparately till tender; then peel and slice. Put thorn in alternate\r\nlayers in a vegetable dish, with salt to taste, and enough sweet cream\r\nnearly to cover. Brown in the oven, and serve at once.\r\n\r\nBEET HASH.--Chop quite finely an equal quantity of cold boiled or\r\nbaked beets and boiled or baked potatoes. Put into a shallow saucepan,\r\nadd salt and sufficient hot cream to moisten. Toss frequently, and cook\r\nuntil well heated throughout. Serve hot.\r\n\r\nBEET GREENS.--Take young, tender beets, clean thoroughly without\r\nseparating the tops and roots. Examine the leaves carefully, and pick\r\noff inferior ones. Put into boiling water, and cook for nearly an hour.\r\nDrain, press out all water, and chop quite fine. Serve with a dressing\r\nof lemon juice or cream, as preferred.\r\n\r\nBEET SALAD, OR CHOPPED BEETS.--Cold boiled or baked beets, chopped\r\nquite fine, but not minced, make a nice salad when served with a\r\ndressing of lemon juice and whipped cream in the proportion of three\r\ntablespoonfuls of lemon juice to one half cup of whipped cream, and salt\r\nif desired.\r\n\r\nBEET SALAD NO. 2.--Chop equal parts of boiled beets and fresh young\r\ncabbage. Mix thoroughly, add salt to taste, a few tablespoonfuls of\r\nsugar, and cover with diluted lemon juice. Equal quantities of cold\r\nboiled beets and cold boiled potatoes, chopped fine, thoroughly mixed,\r\nand served with a dressing of lemon juice and whipped cream, make a\r\npalatable salad. Care should be taken in the preparation of these and\r\nthe preceding salad, not to chop the vegetables so fine as to admit of\r\ntheir being eaten without mastication.\r\n\r\nBOILED BEETS.--Wash carefully, drop into boiling water, and cook\r\nuntil tender. When done, drop into cold water for a minute, when the\r\nskins can be easily rubbed off with the hand. Slice, and serve hot with\r\nlemon juice or with a cream sauce.\r\n\r\nSTEWED BEETS.--Bake beets according to recipe No. 2. Peel, cut in\r\nslices, turn into a saucepan, nearly cover with thin cream, simmer for\r\nten or fifteen minutes, add salt if desired, and thicken the gravy with\r\na little corn starch or flour.\r\n\r\n\r\nCABBAGE.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--The common white garden cabbage is one of the oldest\r\nof cultivated vegetables. A variety of the plant known as red cabbage\r\nwas the delight of ancient gourmands more than eighteen centuries ago.\r\nThe Egyptians adored it, erected altars to it, and made it the first\r\ndish at their repasts. In this they were imitated by the Greeks and\r\nRomans.\r\n\r\nHippocrates, the Father of Medicine, considered the cabbage one of the\r\nmost valuable of remedies, and often prescribed a dish of boiled cabbage\r\nto be eaten with salt for patients suffering with violent colic.\r\nErasistratus looked upon it as a sovereign remedy against paralysis,\r\nwhile Cato in his writings affirmed it to be a panacea for all diseases,\r\nand believed the use the Romans made of it to have been the means\r\nwhereby they were able, during six hundred years, to do without the\r\nassistance of physicians, whom they had expelled from their territory.\r\nThe learned philosopher, Pythagoras, composed books in which he lauded\r\nits wonderful virtues.\r\n\r\nThe Germans are so fond of cabbage that it enters into the composition\r\nof a majority of their culinary products. The cabbage was first raised\r\nin England about 1640, by Sir Anthony Ashley. That this epoch, important\r\nto the English horticultural and culinary world, may never be forgotten,\r\na cabbage is represented upon Sir Anthony's monument.\r\n\r\nThe nutritive value of the cabbage is not high, nearly ninety per cent\r\nbeing water; but it forms an agreeable variety in the list of vegetable\r\nfoods, and is said to possess marked antiscorbutic virtue. It is,\r\nhowever, difficult of digestion, and therefore not suited to weak\r\nstomachs. It would be impossible to sustain life for a lengthened period\r\nupon cabbage, since to supply the body with sufficient food elements,\r\nthe quantity would exceed the rate of digestion and the capacity of the\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nM. Chevreul, a French scientist, has ascertained that the peculiar odor\r\ngiven off during the boiling of cabbage is due to the disengagement of\r\nsulphureted hydrogen. Cabbage is said to be more easily digested raw\r\nthan cooked.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION AND COOKING.--A good cabbage should have a\r\nwell-developed, firm head, with fresh, crisp leaves, free from\r\nworm-holes and decayed portions. To prepare for cooking, stalk, shake\r\nwell to free from dirt, and if there are any signs of insects, lay in\r\ncold salted water for an hour or so to drive them out. Rinse away the\r\nsalt water, and if to be boiled, drop into a small quantity of boiling\r\nwater. Cover closely and boil vigorously until tender. If cooked slowly,\r\nit will be watery and stringy, while overdone cabbage is especially\r\ninsipid and flavorless. If too much water has been used, remove the\r\ncover, that evaporation may go on more rapidly; if too little, replenish\r\nwith boiling water. Cabbage should be cooked in a porcelain-lined or\r\ngranite-ware sauce pan or a very clean iron kettle. Cabbage may also be\r\nsteamed, but care must be taken to have the process as rapid as\r\npossible. Fresh young cabbage will cook in about one hour; old cabbage\r\nrequires from two to three hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nBAKED CABBAGE.--Prepare and chop a firm head of young white\r\ncabbage, boil until tender, drain, and set aside until nearly cold. Then\r\nadd two well-beaten eggs, salt to taste, and a half cup of thin cream or\r\nrich milk. Mix and bake in a pudding dish until lightly browned.\r\n\r\nBOILED CABBAGE.--Carefully clean a nice head of cabbage, divide\r\ninto halves, and with a sharp knife slice very thin, cutting from the\r\ncenter of the head outward. Put into boiling water, cover closely, and\r\ncook rapidly until tender; then turn into a colander and drain, pressing\r\ngently with the back of a plate. Return to the kettle, add salt to\r\ntaste, and sufficient sweet cream to moisten well, heat through if at\r\nall cooled, dish, and serve at once. If preferred, the cream may be\r\nomitted, and the cabbage served with tomato sauce or lemon juice as a\r\ndressing.\r\n\r\nCABBAGE AND TOMATOES.--Boil finely chopped cabbage in as little\r\nwater as possible. When tender, add half the quantity of hot stewed\r\ntomatoes, boil together for a few minutes, being careful to avoid\r\nburning, season with salt if desired, and serve. If preferred, a little\r\nsweet cream may be added just before serving.\r\n\r\nCABBAGE CELERY.--A firm, crisp head of cabbage cut in slices half\r\nan inch or an inch thick, and then again into pieces four or five inches\r\nlong and two or three inches wide, makes a quite appetizing substitute\r\nfor celery.\r\n\r\nCABBAGE HASH.--Chop fine, equal parts of cold boiled potatoes and\r\nboiled cabbage, and season with salt. To each quart of the mixture add\r\none half or three fourths of a cup of thin cream; mix well and boil till\r\nwell heated.\r\n\r\nCHOPPED CABBAGE OR CABBAGE SALAD.--Take one pint of finely chopped\r\ncabbage; pour over it a dressing made of three tablespoonfuls of lemon\r\njuice, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and a half cup of whipped cream,\r\nthoroughly beaten together in the order named; or serve with sugar and\r\ndiluted lemon juice.\r\n\r\nMASHED CABBAGE.--Cut a fine head of cabbage into quarters, and cook\r\nuntil tender. A half hour before it is done, drop in three good-sized\r\npotatoes. When done, take all up in a colander together, press out the\r\nwater, and mash very fine. Season with cream, and salt if desired.\r\n\r\nSTEWED CABBAGE. Chop nice cabbage quite fine, and put it into\r\nboiling water, letting it boil twenty minutes. Turn into a colander and\r\ndrain thoroughly; return to the kettle, cover with milk, and let it boil\r\ntill perfectly tender; season with salt and cream to taste. The beaten\r\nyolk of an egg, stirred in with the cream, is considered an improvement\r\nby some.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAULIFLOWER AND BROCCOLI.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--These vegetables are botanically allied to the\r\ncabbage, and are similar in composition. They are entirely the product\r\nof cultivation, and constitute the inflorescence of the plant, which\r\nhorticultural art has made to grow into a compact head of white color in\r\nthe cauliflower, and of varying shades of buff, green, and purple in the\r\nbroccoli. There is very little difference between the two aside from the\r\ncolor, and they are treated alike for culinary purposes. They were known\r\nto the Greeks and Romans, and highly appreciated by connoisseurs. They\r\nare not as nutritious as the cabbage, but have a more delicate and\r\nagreeable flavor.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION AND COOKING.--The leaves should be green and fresh, and\r\nthe heads of cauliflower creamy white; when there are dark spots, it is\r\nwilted. The color of broccoli will depend upon the variety, but the head\r\nshould be firm, with no discolorations. To prepare, pick off the outside\r\nleaves, cut the stalk squarely across, about two inches below the\r\nflower, and if very thick, split and wash thoroughly in several waters;\r\nor better still, hold it under the faucet, flower downward, and allow a\r\nconstant stream of water to fall over it for several minutes; then place\r\ntop downward in a pan of lukewarm salted water, to drive out any insects\r\nwhich may be hidden in it; examine carefully for worms just the color of\r\nthe stalk; tie in a net (mosquito netting, say) to prevent breaking, or\r\nplace the cauliflower on a plate in a steamer, and boil, or steam, as is\r\nmost convenient. The time required for cooking will vary from twenty to\r\nforty minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\n(The recipes given are applicable to both broccoli and cauliflower.)\r\n\r\nBOILED CAULIFLOWER.--Prepare, divide into neat branches, and tie\r\nsecurely in a net. Put into boiling milk and water, equal quantities,\r\nand cook until the main stalks are tender. Boil rapidly the first five\r\nminutes, afterward more moderately, to prevent the flower from becoming\r\ndone before the stalks. Serve on a hot dish with cream sauce or diluted\r\nlemon juice.\r\n\r\nBROWNED CAULIFLOWER.--Beat together two eggs, a little salt, four\r\ntablespoonfuls of sweet cream, and a small quantity of grated bread\r\ncrumbs well moistened with a little milk, till of the consistency of\r\nbatter. Steam the cauliflower until tender, separate it into small\r\nbunches, dip each top in the mixture, and place in nice order in a\r\npudding dish; put in the oven and brown.\r\n\r\nCAULIFLOWER WITH EGG SAUCE.--Steam the cauliflower until tender,\r\nseparate into small portions, dish, and serve with an egg sauce prepared\r\nas directed for parsnips on page 244.\r\n\r\nCAULIFLOWER WITH TOMATO SAUCE.--Boil or steam the cauliflower until\r\ntender. In another dish prepare a sauce with a pint of strained stewed\r\nsmooth in a little water, and salted to taste. When the cauliflower is\r\ntender, dish, and pour over it the hot tomato sauce. If preferred, a\r\ntablespoonful of thick sweet cream may be added to the sauce before\r\nusing.\r\n\r\nSTEWED CAULIFLOWER.--Boil in as little water as possible, or steam\r\nuntil tender; separate into small portions, add milk, cream and salt to\r\ntaste; stew together for a few minutes, and serve.\r\n\r\nSCOLLOPED CAULIFLOWER.--Prepare the cauliflower, and steam or boil\r\nuntil tender. If boiled, use equal quantities of milk and water.\r\nSeparate into bunches of equal size, place in a pudding dish, cover with\r\na white or cream sauce, sprinkle with grated bread crumbs, and brown in\r\nthe oven.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPINACH.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--This plant is supposed to be a native of western\r\nArabia. There are several varieties which are prepared and served as\r\n\"greens.\" Spinach is largely composed of water. It is considered a\r\nwholesome vegetable, with slightly laxative properties.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION AND COOKING.--Use only tender plants or the tender\r\nleaves of the older stalks, and be sure to have enough, as spinach\r\nshrinks greatly. A peck is not too much for a family of four or five.\r\nPick it over very carefully, trim off the roots and decayed leaves, and\r\nall tough, stringy stalks, and the coarse fibers of the leaves, as those\r\nwill not cook tender until the leaves are overdone. Wash in several\r\nwaters, lifting grit. Shake each bunch well. Spinach is best cooked in\r\nits own juices; this may be best accomplished by cooking it in a double\r\nboiler, or if placed in a pot and slowly heated, it will however, be\r\nstirred frequently at first, to prevent burning; cover closely and cook\r\nuntil tender. The time required will vary from twenty minutes to half an\r\nhour or more. If water is used in the cooking, have a half kettleful\r\nboiling when the spinach is put in, and continue to boil rapidly until\r\nthe leaves are perfectly tender; then drain in a colander, press with\r\nthe back of a plate to extract all water, chop very fine, and either\r\nserve with lemon juice as a dressing, or add a half cup of sweet cream\r\nwith or without a teaspoonful of sugar. Boil up once, stirring\r\nconstantly, and serve very hot. A garnish of sliced boiled eggs is often\r\nemployed with this vegetable.\r\n\r\n\r\nCELERY.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--The common celery is a native of Great Britain. In\r\nits wild state it has a strong, disagreeable taste and smell, and is\r\nknown as _smallage_. By cultivation it becomes more mild and sweet. It\r\nis usually eaten uncooked as a salad herb, or introduced into soups as a\r\nflavouring. In its raw state, it is difficult of digestion.\r\n\r\nCelery from the market may be kept fresh for some time by wrapping the\r\nbunches in brown paper, sprinkling them with water, then wrapping in a\r\ndamp cloth and putting in some cool, dark place.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES_\r\n\r\nCELERY SALAD.--Break the stems apart, cut off all green portions,\r\nand after washing well put in cold water for an hour or so before\r\nserving.\r\n\r\nSTEWED CELERY.--Cut the tender inner parts of celery heads into\r\npieces about a finger long. The outer and more fibrous stalks may be\r\nsaved to season soups. Put in a stewpan, and add sufficient water to\r\ncover; then cover the pan closely, and set it where it will just simmer\r\nfor an hour, or until the celery is perfectly tender. When cooked, add a\r\npint of rich milk, part cream if you have it, salt to taste, and when\r\nboiling, stir in a tablespoon of flour rubbed smooth in a little milk.\r\nBoil up once and serve.\r\n\r\nSTEWED CELERY NO. 2.--Cut the white part of fine heads of celery\r\ninto small pieces, blanch in boiling water, turn into a colander, and\r\ndrain. Heat a cup and a half of milk to boiling in a stewpan; add the\r\ncelery, and stew gently until tender. Remove the celery with a skimmer,\r\nand stir into the milk the beaten yolks of two eggs and one half cup of\r\ncream. Cook until thickened; pour over the celery, and serve.\r\n\r\nCELERY WITH TOMATO SAUCE.--Prepare the celery as in the preceding\r\nrecipe, and cook until tender in a small quantity of boiling water.\r\nDrain in a colander, and for three cups of stewed celery prepare a sauce\r\nwith a pint of strained stewed tomato, heated to boiling and thickened\r\nwith a tablespoonful of flour rubbed smooth in a little cold water. If\r\ndesired, add a half cup of thin cream. Turn over the celery, and serve\r\nhot.\r\n\r\nCELERY AND POTATO HASH.--To three cups of cold boiled or baked\r\npotato, chopped rather fine, add one cup of cooked celery, minced. Put\r\nseason. Heat to boiling, tossing and stirring so that the whole will be\r\nheated throughout, and serve hot.\r\n\r\n\r\nASPARAGUS.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--The asparagus is a native of Europe, and in its wild\r\nstate is a sea-coast plant. The young shoots form the edible portion.\r\nThe plant was known to the ancient Greeks and Romans, who not only used\r\nit as a table delicacy but considered it very useful in the treatment of\r\ninternal diseases. Roman cooks provided themselves with a supply of the\r\nvegetable for winter use by cutting fine heads and drying them. When\r\nwanted, they were put into hot water and gently cooked.\r\n\r\nThe asparagus is remarkable as containing a crystalline alkaloid called\r\n_asparagin_, which is thought to possess diuretic properties.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION AND COOKING.--Select fresh and tender asparagus. Those\r\nversed in its cultivation, assert that it should be cut at least three\r\ntimes a week, and barely to the ground. If it is necessary to keep the\r\nbunches for some time before cooking, stand them, tops uppermost, in\r\nwater about one half inch deep, in the cellar or other cool place. Clean\r\neach stalk separately by swashing back and forth in a pan of cold water\r\ntill perfectly free from sand, then break off all the tough portions,\r\ncut in equal lengths, tie in bunches of half a dozen or more with soft\r\ntape, drop into boiling water barely sufficient to cover, and simmer\r\ngently until perfectly tender.\r\n\r\nIf the asparagus is to be stewed, break: (not cut) into small pieces;\r\nwhen it will not snap off quickly, the stalk is too tough for use.\r\n\r\nAsparagus must be taken from the water just as soon as tender, while yet\r\nfirm in appearance. If boiled soft, it loses its flavor and is\r\nuninviting. It is a good plan when it is to be divided before cooking,\r\nif the stalks are not perfectly tender, to boil the hardest portions\r\nfirst. Asparagus cooked in bunches is well done, if, when held by the\r\nthick end in a horizontal position between the fingers, it only bends\r\nlightly and does not fall heavily down.\r\n\r\nThe time required for boiling asparagus depends upon its freshness and\r\nage. Fresh, tender asparagus cooks in a very few minutes, so quickly,\r\nindeed, that the Roman emperor Augustus, intimating that any affair must\r\nbe concluded without delay, was accustomed to say, \"Let that be done\r\nquicker than you can cook asparagus.\" Fifteen or twenty minutes will\r\nsuffice if young and fresh; if old, from thirty to fifty minutes will be\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nASPARAGUS AND PEAS.--Asparagus and green peas make a nice dish\r\nserved together, and if of proportionate age, require the same length of\r\ntime to cook. Wash the asparagus, shell and look over the peas, put\r\ntogether into boiling water, cook, and serve as directed for stewed\r\nasparagus.\r\n\r\nASPARAGUS POINTS.--Cut of enough heads in two-inch lengths to make\r\nthree pints. Put into boiling water just sufficient to cover. When\r\ntender, drain off the water, add a half cup of cream, and salt if\r\ndesired. Serve at once.\r\n\r\nASPARAGUS ON TOAST.--Cook the asparagus in bunches, and when\r\ntender, drain and place on slices of nicely browned toast moistened in\r\nthe asparagus liquor. Pour over all a cream sauce prepared as directed\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nASPARAGUS WITH CREAM SAUCE.--Thoroughly wash, tie in small bunches,\r\nand put into boiling water; boil till perfectly tender. Drain\r\nthoroughly, untie the bunches, place the stalks all the same way upon a\r\nhot plate, with a dressing prepared as follows: Let a pint of sweet\r\ncream (about six hours old is best) come to the boiling point, and stir\r\ninto it salt to taste and a level tablespoonful of flour rubbed smooth\r\nwith a little cold cream.\r\n\r\nASPARAGUS WITH EGG SAUCE.--Prepare and cook asparagus as directed\r\nabove. When tender, drain thoroughly, and serve on a hot dish or on\r\nslices of nicely browned toast, with an egg sauce prepared in the\r\nfollowing manner: Heat a half cup of rich milk to boiling, add salt, and\r\nturn into it very slowly the well-beaten yolk of an egg, stirring\r\nconstantly at the same time. Let the whole just thicken, and remove from\r\nthe fire at once.\r\n\r\nSTEWED ASPARAGUS.--Wash, break into inch pieces, simmer till tender\r\nin water just to cover, add sufficient rich milk, part cream if\r\nconvenient, to make a gravy, thicken slightly with flour, a teaspoonful\r\nto a pint of milk; add salt if desired, boil up together once, and\r\nserve.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEA-KALE.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--This plant, a native of Britain, and much esteemed as\r\na vegetable in England and on the Continent, is also in its wild state a\r\nsea-coast plant. When properly cooked, it is nutritious and easy of\r\ndigestion. In appearance and flavor it greatly resembles asparagus, and\r\nthe suggestions for cooking and recipes given for that vegetable are\r\napplicable to sea-kale.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTUCE AND RADISH.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--These two vegetables, although wholly different, the\r\none being the leaf of a plant, the other the root, are both so commonly\r\nserved as relishes that we will speak of them together. Both have long\r\nbeen known and used. Wild lettuce is said to be the bitter herb which\r\nthe Hebrews ate with the Paschal lamb. The ancient Greek and Roman\r\nepicures valued lettuce highly, and bestowed great care upon its\r\ncultivation, in some instances watering the plants with sweet wine\r\ninstead of water, in order to communicate to them a delicate perfume and\r\nflavor. The common garden lettuce of the present day is a hardy plant,\r\nwhich supplies an agreeable, digestible, and, when served with a\r\nwholesome dressing, unobjectionable salad.\r\n\r\nThe common radish is supposed to be indigenous to China. Ancient writers\r\non foods mention the radish as used by the early Greeks and Romans, who\r\nfancied that at the end of three years its seed would produce cabbages.\r\nThey had also the singular custom of making the radish the ignominious\r\nprojectile with which in times of tumult the mob pursued persons whose\r\npolitical opinions had made them obnoxious. When quiet was restored, the\r\ndisgraced vegetable was boiled and eaten with oil and vinegar. Common\r\ngarden radishes are of different shapes and of various colors on the\r\noutside, there being black, violet, red, and white radishes. The inside\r\nportion of all, however, is white. They are sometimes cooked, but more\r\ncommonly served raw. A dish of crisp, coral radishes adds beauty to the\r\nappearance of the table, but they are not possessed of a high nutritive\r\nvalue, being very similar to the turnip in composition, and unless very\r\nyoung, tender, and when eaten thoroughly masticated, are quite difficult\r\nof digestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nLETTUCE.--Wash well, put into cold water, and set on ice or on the\r\ncellar bottom for an hour or more before using. Dry the leaves with a\r\nsoft towel and use whole or tear into convenient pieces with a silver\r\nfork; never cut with a knife. Serve with a dressing prepared of equal\r\nquantities of lemon juice and sugar, diluted with a little ice water;\r\nor, with a dressing of cream and sugar, in the proportion of three or\r\nfour tablespoonfuls of thin cream to a teaspoonful of sugar. The\r\ndressing may be prepared, and after the sugar is dissolved, a very\r\nlittle lemon juice (just enough to thicken the cream slightly, but not\r\nsufficient to curdle it) may be added if desired.\r\n\r\nRADISHES.--Wash thoroughly young and tender radishes, and arrange\r\nin a glass dish with the taper ends meeting. Scatter bits of cracked ice\r\namong them. An inch of the stem, if left on, serve as a convenience in\r\nhandling.\r\n\r\n\r\nCYMLING, SUMMER SQUASH, OR VEGETABLE MARROW.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--The vegetable marrow (sometimes called cymling) is\r\nthought to be a variety of the common gourd, from which also the pumpkin\r\nand winter squash appear to have been derived. It is easily digested,\r\nbut on account of the abundance of water in its composition, its\r\nnutritive value is very low.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION AND COOKING.--When very young, most varieties need no\r\npreparation for cooking, aside from washing thoroughly. After cooking,\r\nthe skin can be easily rubbed off and the seeds removed. If more mature,\r\npare thinly, and if large, divide into halves or quarters and scoop out\r\nthe seeds. Summer squashes are better steamed than boiled. If boiled,\r\nthey should be cooked in so little water that it will be quite\r\nevaporated when they are tender. From twenty to sixty minutes will be\r\nrequired for cooking.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nMASHED SQUASH.--Wash, peel, remove seeds, and steam until tender.\r\nPlace the squash in a clean cloth, mash thoroughly, squeeze until the\r\nsquash is quite dry, or rub through a fine colander and afterward simmer\r\nuntil neatly dry; season with cream, and a little salt if desired, and\r\nheat again before serving. A teaspoonful of sugar may be added with the\r\ncream, if desired.\r\n\r\nSQUASH WITH EGG SAUCE.--Prepare, steam till tender, cut into\r\npieces, and serve with an egg sauce made the same as directed for\r\nasparagus, page 256.\r\n\r\nSTEWED SQUASH.--Prepare, cut into pieces, and stew until tender in\r\na small quantity of boiling water; drain, pressing out all the water;\r\nserve on toast with cream or white sauce. Or, divide in quarters, remove\r\nthe seeds, cook in a double boiler, in its own juices, which when done\r\nmay be thickened with a little flour. Season with salt if desired, and\r\nserve hot.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTER SQUASHES.\r\n\r\nThe winter squash and pumpkin are allied in nature to the summer squash.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION AND COOKING.--Select squashes of a firm texture, wash,\r\nbreak in pieces with a hatchet if hard-shell, or if the shell is soft,\r\ndivide with a knife; remove all seeds, and boil, stew, steam, or bake,\r\nas preferred.\r\n\r\nTo boil or steam, from thirty minutes to one hour's time will be needed;\r\nto bake, one to two hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nBAKED SQUASH..--The hard-shell varieties are best for baking. Wash,\r\ndivide, and lay, shells downward, on the top grate of the oven, or place\r\nin a shallow baking dish with a little boiling water. Boil until tender,\r\nserve in the shell, or scrape out the soft part, mash and serve with two\r\nlargo tablespoonful of cream to a pint of squash. If preferred, the\r\nskins may be removed before baking, and the squash served the same as\r\nsweet potato, for which it makes a good substitute.\r\n\r\nSTEAMED SQUASH.--Prepare the squash, and steam until tender. Mash\r\nand season as for baked squash.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PUMPKIN.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--When our forefathers came to this country, they found\r\nthe pumpkin growing in the Indian cornfields, and at once made use of\r\nit. Although as food it did not supply what its handsome exterior\r\npromised, yet in the absence of other fruits and relishes, of which the\r\nexigencies of a new country deprived them, they soon found the pumpkin\r\nquite palatable; and the taste, cultivated through necessity, has been\r\nhanded down through generations, until the pumpkin stewed and baked in\r\npies, has become an established favorite.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nBAKED PUMPKIN.--Wash the pumpkin well on the outside, divide into\r\nquarters if small, into sixths or eighths if large; remove the seeds but\r\nnot the rind. Bake as directed for squash. Serve in the rind, dishing it\r\nout by spoonfuls.\r\n\r\nSTEWED PUMPKIN.--Select a good, ripe pumpkin, and cut in halves;\r\nremove the seeds, slice halfway around, pare, cut into inch pieces, put\r\nover the fire in a kettle containing a small quantity of boiling water,\r\nand stew gently, stirring frequently until it breaks to pieces. Cool,\r\nrub through a colander, and place where it will just simmer, but not\r\nburn, until the water is all evaporated and the pumpkin dry. Pumpkin for\r\npies is much richer baked like squash, and rubbed through a colander\r\nafter the skin has been removed.\r\n\r\nDRIED PUMPKIN.--Pumpkin may be dried and kept for future use. The\r\nbest way is first to cut and stew the pumpkin, then spread on plates,\r\nand dry quickly in the oven. Dried in this manner, it is easily\r\nsoftened, when needed, by soaking in a small quantity of water, and is\r\nconsidered nearly as good as that freshly stewed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMATO.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--The tomato, or \"love apple,\" as it was called in the\r\nearly part of the century, is a native of South America and Mexico. It\r\nwas formerly regarded as poisonous, and though often planted and prized\r\nas a curiosity in the flower garden, it has only within the last half\r\ncentury come to be considered as a wholesome article of diet.\r\nBotanically, it is allied to the potato. It is an acid fruit, largely\r\ncomposed of water, and hence of low nutritive value; but it is justly\r\nesteemed as a relish, and is very serviceable to the cook in the\r\npreparation of soups and various mixed dishes.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION AND COOKING.--Tomatoes to be served in an uncooked\r\nstate should be perfectly ripe and fresh. The medium-sized, smooth ones\r\nare the best. To peel, pour scalding water over them; let them remain\r\nfor half a minute, plunge into cold water, allow them to cool, when the\r\nskins can be easily rubbed off. Tomatoes should always be cooked in\r\nporcelain or granite ware; iron makes them look dark, and being\r\nslightly acid in character, they are not wholesome cooked in tin\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nTomatoes require cooking a long time; one hour is needed, and two are\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nBAKED TOMATOES.--Fill a pudding dish two thirds full of stewed\r\ntomatoes; season with salt, and sprinkle grated crumbs of good\r\nwhole-wheat or Graham bread over it until the top looks dry. Brown in\r\nthe oven, and serve with a cream dressing.\r\n\r\nBAKED TOMATOES NO. 2. Wash and wipe a quantity of smooth,\r\neven-sized tomatoes; remove the stems with a sharp-pointed knife.\r\nArrange on an earthen pudding or pie dish, and bake whole in a moderate\r\noven. Serve with cream.\r\n\r\nSCALLOPED TOMATOES.--Take a pint of stewed tomatoes, which have\r\nbeen rubbed through a colander, thicken with one and one fourth cups of\r\nlightly picked crumbs of Graham or whole-wheat bread, or a sufficient\r\nquantity to make it quite thick, add salt if desired, and a half cup of\r\nsweet cream, mix well, and bake for twenty minutes. Or, fill a pudding\r\ndish with alternate layers of peeled and sliced tomatoes and bread\r\ncrumbs, letting the topmost layer be of tomatoes. Cover, and bake in a\r\nmoderate oven for an hour or longer, according to depth. Uncover, and\r\nbrown for ten or fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nSTEWED CORN AND TOMATOES.--Boil dried or fresh corn until perfectly\r\ntender, add to each cup of corn two cups of stewed, strained tomatoes,\r\neither canned or freshly cooked. Salt to taste, boil together for five\r\nor ten minutes, and serve plain or with a little cream added.\r\n\r\nTOMATO GRAVY.--Heat to boiling one pint of strained stewed\r\ntomatoes, either canned or fresh, and thicken with a tablespoonful of\r\nflour rubbed smooth in a little water; add salt and when thickened, if\r\ndesired, a half cup of hot cream. Boil together for a minute or two and\r\nserve at once.\r\n\r\nTOMATO SALAD.--Select perfectly ripe tomatoes, and peel at least an\r\nhour before using. Slice, and place on ice or in a cool place. Serve\r\nplain or with lemon juice or sugar as preferred.\r\n\r\nTOMATO SALAD NO. 2.--Use one half small yellow tomatoes and one\r\nhalf red. Slice evenly and lay in the dish in alternate layers. Powder\r\nlightly with sugar, and turn over them a cupful of orange juice to a\r\npint of tomato, or if preferred, the juice of lemons may be used\r\ninstead. Set on ice and cool before serving.\r\n\r\nBROILED TOMATOES.--Choose perfectly ripened but firm tomatoes of\r\nequal size. Place them on a wire broiler, and broil over glowing coals,\r\nfrom three to eight minutes, according to size, then turn and cook on\r\nthe other side. Broil the stem end first. Serve hot with salt to season,\r\nand a little cream.\r\n\r\nTOMATO PUDDING.--Fill an earthen pudding dish with alternate layers\r\nof stale bread and fresh tomatoes, peeled, sliced, and sprinkled lightly\r\nwith sugar. Cover the dish and bake.\r\n\r\nSTEWED TOMATOES.--Peel and slice the tomatoes. Put them into a\r\ndouble boiler, without the addition of water, and stew for an hour or\r\nlonger. When done, serve plain with a little sugar added, or season with\r\nsalt and a tablespoonful of rather thick sweet cream to each pint of\r\ntomatoes. If the tomatoes are thin and very juicy, they may be thickened\r\nwith a little flour rubbed smooth in a little cold water. They are much\r\nbetter, however, to stew a longer time until the water they contain is\r\nsufficiently evaporated to make them of the desired consistency. The\r\nstew may also be thickened, if desired, by the addition of bread crumbs,\r\nrice, or macaroni.\r\n\r\nTOMATO WITH OKRA.--Wash the okra, cut off the stem and nibs, and\r\nslice thin. For a quart of sliced okra, peel and slice three large\r\ntomatoes. Stew the tomatoes for half an hour, then add the okra, and\r\nsimmer together for half an hour longer. Season with salt and a little\r\ncream.\r\n\r\n\r\nEGG PLANT.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--The egg plant, a vegetable indigenous to the East\r\nIndies, is somewhat allied in character to the tomato. In shape, it\r\nresembles an egg, from which fact it doubtless derives its name. It\r\nranks low in nutritive value. When fresh, the plant is firm and has a\r\nsmooth skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nSCALLOPED EGG PLANT.--Pare a fresh egg plant. If large, divide in\r\nquarters, if small, in halves, and put to cook in boiling water. Cook\r\nuntil it can be easily pierced with a straw, and drain in a colander.\r\nTurn into a hot dish, and beat with a silver fork until finely broken.\r\nMeasure the egg plant, and add to it an equal quantity of graded bread\r\ncrumbs, a little salt, and a tablespoonful of thick sweet cream. Lastly,\r\nadd one well beaten egg. Put in an earthen pudding dish, and brown in\r\nthe oven until the egg is set, and the whole is heated throughout but\r\nnot dry.\r\n\r\nBAKED EGG PLANT.--Wash and cook whole in boiling water until\r\ntender. Divide in halves, remove the inside with a spoon, taking care\r\nnot to break the skin. Beat the egg plant smooth with a fork. Season\r\nwith salt and cream, and if desired, a stalk of celery or a small slice\r\nof onion very finely minced, for flavor. Put back in the skin, sprinkle\r\nthe top with bread crumbs, and brown the outside uppermost in the oven.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUCUMBER.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--The cucumber is a native of Southern Asia, although\r\nit is quite commonly cultivated in most civilized countries. It formed a\r\npart of the dietary of the Israelites when in Egypt, where it grew very\r\nplentifully. The ancient Greeks held the cucumber in high esteem, and\r\nattributed to it wonderful properties.\r\n\r\nThe cucumber is not a nutritious vegetable, and when served in its raw\r\nstate, as it so generally is, dressed with salt, vinegar, pepper, and\r\nsimilar condiments, it is an exceedingly indigestible article. If it is\r\nto be eaten at all, it should first be cooked. It may be pared, divided\r\nin quarters, the seeds removed, and cooked in a small quantity of water\r\nuntil perfectly tender, and served on toast with an egg sauce or a cream\r\nsauce; or it may be prepared the same as directed for Escalloped Egg\r\nPlant.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALSIFY, OR VEGETABLE OYSTER.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--The vegetable oyster plant, sometimes called purple\r\ngoat's-beard, or salsify, is indigenous to some portions of Great\r\nBritain. The long, slender root becomes fleshy and tender under\r\ncultivation, with a flavor, when cooked, somewhat resembling that of the\r\nmollusk for which it is named. On this account, it is much esteemed for\r\nsoups. A variety of the plant grows near the line of perpetual snow, and\r\nforms the principal article of fresh vegetable food in the dietary of\r\nKurdistan.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION AND COOKING.--Select fresh and unshriveled roots, wash\r\nand scrape well, dropping into cold water as soon as cleaned, to prevent\r\ndiscoloration. If the roots are covered with cold water for a half hour\r\nor more before scraping, they can be cleaned much easier. Use a\r\nporcelain-lined kettle, for cooking, as an iron one will discolor it\r\nand injure its flavor. From twenty minutes to one hour, according to\r\nage, is required to cook it tender.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nSCALLOPED VEGETABLE OYSTERS.--Boil two quarts of sliced vegetable\r\noysters in about two quarts of water until very tender. Skim them out,\r\nand fill a pudding dish with alternate layers of crumbs and oysters,\r\nhaving a layer of crumbs for the top. To the water in which they were\r\nboiled, add a pint and a half of thin cream, salt to taste, boil up, and\r\nthicken with a heaping tablespoonful or two of flour rubbed smooth in a\r\nlittle cold cream. Pour this over the oysters and crumbs, and bake a\r\nhalf hour. If this is not enough to cover well, add more cream or milk.\r\nStewed tomatoes are a nice accompaniment for escalloped vegetable\r\noysters.\r\n\r\nSTEWED VEGETABLE OYSTERS.--Wash, scrape, and cut into slices not\r\nmore than one half inch in thickness. Put into a small quantity of\r\nboiling water and cook until tender. If a large quantity of water is\r\nused, the savory juices escape, and leave the roots very insipid. When\r\ntender, pour in a cup of rich milk and simmer for five or ten minutes;\r\nadd a little flour rubbed smooth in milk, and salt if desired; boil up\r\nonce, and serve as a vegetable or on slices of nicely browned toast. If\r\npreferred, a well-beaten egg may be used in the place of flour.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN CORN, PEAS, AND BEANS.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.--Corn, peas, and beans in their immature state are so\r\nnearly allied to vegetables, that we give in this connection recipes for\r\ncooking green corn, green beans, and green peas. A general rule\r\napplicable to all is that they should, when possible, be cooked and\r\neaten the day they are gathered, as otherwise they lose much of their\r\nsweetness and flavor. For corn, select young, tender, well-filled ears,\r\nfrom which the milk will spurt when the grain is broken with the finger\r\nnail. Beans and peas are fresh only when the pods are green, plump, snap\r\ncrisply when broken, and have unshriveled stems. If the pods bend and\r\nappear wilted, they are stale. Corn, peas, and beans are wholesome and\r\nnutritious foods when thoroughly cooked and sufficiently masticated, but\r\nthey are almost indigestible unless the hull, or skin, of each pea,\r\nbean, or grain of corn, be broken before being swallowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES FOR CORN._\r\n\r\nBAKED CORN.--Select nice fresh ears of tender corn of as nearly\r\nequal size as possible. Open the husks and remove all the silk from the\r\ncorn; replace and tie the husks around the ears with a thread. Put the\r\ncorn in a hot oven, and bake thirty minutes or until tender. Remove the\r\nhusks before serving.\r\n\r\nBAKED CORN NO. 2.--Scrape enough corn from the cob (as directed\r\nbelow for Corn Pulp) to make one and a half quarts. Put into a baking\r\ndish, season with salt if desired, add enough milk, part cream if\r\nconvenient, barely to cover the corn, and bake in a hot oven twenty-five\r\nor thirty minutes.\r\n\r\nBOILED GREEN CORN.--Remove the husks and every thread of the silk\r\nfiber. Place in a kettle, the larger ears at the bottom, with sufficient\r\nboiling water nearly to cover. Cover with the clean inner husks, and\r\ncook from twenty to thirty minutes, according to the age of the corn;\r\ntoo much cooking hardens it and detracts from its flavor. Try a kernel,\r\nand when the milk has thickened, and a raw taste is no longer apparent,\r\nit is sufficiently cooked. Green corn is said to be sweeter, boiled with\r\nthe inner husks on. For cooking in this way, strip off all outer husks,\r\nand remove the silk, tying the inner husk around the ear with a bit of\r\nthread, and boil. Remove from the kettle, place in a heated dish, cover\r\nwith a napkin and serve at once on the cob. Some recommend scoring or\r\nsplitting the corn by drawing a sharp knife through each row lengthwise.\r\nThis is a wise precaution against insufficient mastication.\r\n\r\nSTEWED CORN PULP.--Take six ears of green corn or enough to make a\r\npint of raw pulp; with a sharp knife cut a thin shaving from each row of\r\nkernels or score each kernel, and with the back of the knife scrape out\r\nthe pulp, taking care to leave the hulls on the cob. Heat a cup and a\r\nhalf of rich milk--part cream if it can be afforded--to boiling, add the\r\ncorn, cook twenty or thirty minutes; season with salt and a teaspoonful\r\nof sugar if desired.\r\n\r\nCORN CAKES.--To a pint of corn pulp add two well-beaten eggs and\r\ntwo tablespoonfuls of flour; season with salt if desired, and brown on a\r\ngriddle. Canned corn finely chopped can be used, but two tablespoonfuls\r\nof milk should be added, as the corn is less moist.\r\n\r\nCORN PUDDING.--One quart of corn pulp prepared as for stewing, one\r\nquart of milk, three eggs, and a little salt. Mix the corn with a pint\r\nof the milk, and heat it to boiling. Break the eggs into the remainder\r\nof the milk, and add it to the corn, turn all into an oiled pudding\r\ndish, and bake slowly until the custard is well set.\r\n\r\nROASTED GREEN CORN.--Remove the husks and silk, and place the corn\r\nbefore an open grate or in a wire broiler over hot coals until the\r\nkernels burst open, or bury in hot ashes without removing the husks.\r\nScore the grains, and serve from the cob.\r\n\r\nSTEWED GREEN CORN.--Cut the corn from the cob and with the back of\r\nthe knife scrape off all the pulp, being careful to leave the hull on\r\nthe cob. Put into a stewpan with half as much water as corn, cover\r\nclosely and stew gently until thoroughly cooked, stirring frequently to\r\nprevent the corn from sticking to the pan; add cream or milk to make the\r\nrequisite amount of juice, and season with salt if desired. A\r\nteaspoonful of white sugar may be added if desired.\r\n\r\nCold boiled corn cut from the cob and stewed a few minutes in a little\r\nmilk, makes a very palatable dish.\r\n\r\nSUMMER SUCCOTASH.--This maybe made by cooking equal quantities of\r\nshelled beans and corn cut from the cob, separately until tender, and\r\nthen mixing them; or the beans may be cooked until nearly soft, an equal\r\nquantity of shaved corn added, and the whole cooked fifteen or twenty\r\nminutes or longer. Season with cream, and salt if desired.\r\n\r\nDRIED CORN.--The sweet varieties of corn taken when young and\r\ntender and properly dried, furnish an excellent material for nearly all\r\npurposes to which green corn is put. Take green corn, just right for\r\neating, have it free from silk; cut the fleshy portion from the cob with\r\na sharp knife, then with the back of the knife gently press the\r\nremaining pulp from the cob. Spread thinly on plates and put into an\r\noven hot enough to scald, not scorch it. Watch closely for a half hour\r\nor more, turning and stirring frequently with a fork. When thus\r\nthoroughly scalded, the corn may be left without further attention if\r\nplaced in a moderate oven, save an occasional stirring to prevent its\r\nsticking to the plate, until the drying is complete, which ought to be\r\nin about forty-eight hours; however, if one can spend the time to watch\r\nclosely and stir very frequently, the drying may be completed in a\r\nsingle afternoon in a rather hot oven. Be careful that it does not\r\nscorch.\r\n\r\nWhen needed for use, soak over night and cook in accordance with recipes\r\nfor Stewed Corn, Succotash, etc., pages 265, 234, only remembering to\r\nallow a longer time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES FOR PEAS._\r\n\r\nSTEWED PEAS.--If from the garden, pick and shell the peas with\r\nclean hands; if from the market, wash the pods before shelling, so that\r\nthe peas will not require washing, as they are much better without. When\r\nshelled, put into a colander and sift out the fine particles and\r\nundeveloped blossoms. If not of equal growth, sort the peas and put the\r\nolder ones to cook ten minutes before the others. Use a porcelain\r\nkettle, with one half pint of boiling water for each quart of peas, if\r\nyoung and tender; older ones, which require longer stewing, need more.\r\nCover closely, and simmer gently till tender. The time required for\r\nyoung peas is from twenty-five to thirty minutes; older ones require\r\nforty to fifty minutes. Serve without draining, season with salt and\r\nenough sweet cream to make them as juicy as desired. If preferred, the\r\njuice may be thickened with a little flour.\r\n\r\nThe peas may be purposely stewed in a larger quantity of water, and\r\nserved in their own juices thickened with a little flour and seasoned\r\nwith salt.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES FOR BEANS._\r\n\r\nLIMA BEANS.--Lima beans are not good until they are full grown and\r\nhave turned white. Shell, wash, cover with boiling water, and cook about\r\none hour or until tender. Let the water nearly evaporate, and add milk\r\nor cream thickened with a little flour. Season with salt to taste, boil\r\nup once, and serve.\r\n\r\nSHELLED BEANS.--Shell, wash, drop into boiling water sufficient to\r\ncover, and cook until tender. Let the water boil nearly away, and serve\r\nwithout draining. Season with thin cream, and salt if desired.\r\n\r\nSTRING BEANS.--Wash well in cold water. Remove the strong fiber, or\r\nstrings, as they are called, by paring both edges with a sharp knife;\r\nfew cooks do this thoroughly. Break off stems and points, carefully\r\nrejecting any imperfect or diseased pods. Lay a handful evenly on a\r\nboard and cut them all at once into inch lengths. Put in a porcelain\r\nkettle, cover with boiling water, and cook from one to three hours,\r\naccording to age and variety, testing frequently, as they should be\r\nremoved from the kettle just as soon as done. When very young and\r\ntender, only water sufficient to keep them from burning will be needed.\r\nWhen done, add a half cup of thin cream, and salt to taste. If the\r\nquantity of juice is considerable, thicken with a little flour.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ONION.\r\n\r\nThe onion belongs to a class of foods containing an acrid oil of a\r\nstrongly irritating character, on which account it cannot be considered\r\na wholesome food when eaten raw, as it so generally is. The essential\r\noil is, however, quite volatile, so that when cooked, after being first\r\nparboiled in two or three waters, its irritating properties are largely\r\nremoved. The varieties grown in warm climates are much milder and\r\nsweeter than those grown in colder countries. The onion is valuable for\r\nflavoring purposes. It may also be boiled and served whole with a cream\r\nsauce, or cut in quarters and prepared as directed for Scalloped\r\nTurnips, page 242.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANNING VEGETABLES.\r\n\r\nMost housekeepers experience more difficulty in canning and keeping\r\nvegetables than fruit. This is frequently owing to lack of care to\r\nsecure perfect cans, covers, and rubbers, and to cook the vegetables\r\nthoroughly. Whatever is to be canned must be cooked sufficiently to be\r\neaten, and must be boiling at the time it is put into the cans. Care as\r\nto the cleanliness of the cans and their sterilization is also\r\nimportant, and after the canning process is completed, all vegetables\r\nput up in glass should be kept in a cool, dark place. The general\r\ndirections given for canning fruits should be followed in canning\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nCANNED CORN.--Select corn just ripe enough for table use, and\r\nprepare as directed for stewed corn. It will require from twelve to\r\nfifteen ears to fill sufficiently each quart can. To insure success, the\r\ncans should be so full that when the corn is shrunken by the cooking,\r\nthe can will still be well filled. Pack the corn in the cans, working it\r\ndown closely by means of the small end of a potato masher, so the milk\r\nwill cover the corn and completely fill the can; heap a little more corn\r\nloosely on the top, and screw the covers on sufficiently tight to\r\nprevent water from getting into the can. Place the cans in a boiler, on\r\nthe bottom of which has been placed some straw or a rack; also take care\r\nnot to let the cans come in contact with each other, by wrapping each in\r\na cloth or by placing a chip between them. A double layer of cans may be\r\nplaced in the boiler, one on top of the other, if desirable, provided\r\nthere is some intervening substance. Fill the boiler with cold water so\r\nas completely to cover the cans; place over the fire, bring gradually to\r\na boil, and keep boiling steadily for four hours. Remove the boiler from\r\nthe fire, and allow the cans to cool gradually, tightening the covers\r\nfrequently as they cool.\r\n\r\nIf the corn in the can shrinks, do not open to refill. If cooked\r\nthoroughly, and due care is taken in other particulars, there need be no\r\nfailure. Wrap closely in brown paper, and put away in a dark, cool, dry\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nCANNED CORN AND TOMATOES.--Use about one third corn and two thirds\r\ntomatoes, or in equal portions if preferred. Cook the tomatoes in a\r\ndouble boiler for an hour and a half or longer; and in another double\r\nboiler, when the tomatoes are nearly done, cook the corn in its own\r\njuices until thoroughly done. Turn them together, heat to boiling, and\r\ncan at once.\r\n\r\nCANNED PEAS.--Select peas which are fresh, young, and tender.\r\nShell, pack into perfect cans, shaking and filling as full as possible,\r\nadd sufficient cold water to fill them to overflowing, screw on the\r\ncovers, and cook and seal the same as directed for canning corn.\r\n\r\nCANNED TOMATOES.--Tomatoes for canning should be freshly gathered,\r\nripe, but not at all softened.\r\n\r\nAs they are best cooked in their own juices, peel, slice, put into a\r\ndouble boiler or a porcelain fruit-kettle set inside a dish filled with\r\nboiling water, and cook from one to two hours. Cooked in the ordinary\r\nway, great care will be required to keep the fruit from burning. When\r\nthoroughly cooked--simple scalding will not do--put into cans, and be\r\nsure that all air bubbles are expelled before sealing. Wrap in dark\r\nbrown paper, and put in a cool, dry, dark place.\r\n\r\nCANNED TOMATOES NO. 2.--Cut the fruit into thick slices, let it\r\nstand and drain until a large portion of the juice has drained off; then\r\npack solid in new or perfect cans. Allow them to stand a little time,\r\nthen again drain off the juice; fill up a second time with sliced\r\ntomatoes, and screw on the top of the cans without the rubbers. Pack\r\ninto a wash boiler as directed for canning corn, and boil for two hours,\r\nthen put on the rubbers and seal. When cold, tighten the covers and put\r\naway.\r\n\r\nSTRING BEANS.--Select young and tender beans, string them, and cut\r\ninto pieces about one half inch in length. Pack the cans as full as\r\npossible, and fill with water until every crevice between the beans is\r\nfull. Screw on the covers and can in the same manner as corn.\r\n\r\nShelled beans may be canned in the same way.\r\n\r\nCANNED PUMPKIN AND SQUASH.--These fruits when canned are quite as\r\ndesirable for pies as the fresh material. The same general rules should\r\nbe followed as in canning other vegetables and fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE TOPICS.\r\n\r\n    The word \"vegetarian\" is not derived from \"vegetable,\" but from the\r\n    Latin, _homo vegetus_, meaning among the Romans a strong, robust,\r\n    thoroughly healthy man.\r\n\r\n    AN INTELLECTUAL FEAST.--Professor Louis Agassiz in his early manhood\r\n    visited Germany to consult Oken, the transcendentalist in zoölogical\r\n    classification. \"After I had delivered to him my letter of\r\n    introduction,\" he once said to a friend, \"Oken asked me to dine with\r\n    him, and you may suppose with what joy I accepted the invitation.\r\n    The dinner consisted only of potatoes, boiled and roasted; but it\r\n    was the best dinner I ever ate; for there was Oken. Never before\r\n    were such potatoes grown on this planet; for the mind of the man\r\n    seemed to enter into what we ate sociably together, and I devoured\r\n    his intellect while munching his potatoes.\"\r\n\r\n    Dr. Abernethy's recipe for using cucumbers: \"Peel the cucumber,\r\n    slice it, pepper it, put vinegar to it, then throw it out the\r\n    window.\"\r\n\r\n    A green son of the Emerald Isle was eating sweet corn from the cob\r\n    for the first time. He handed the cob to the waiter, and asked,\r\n    \"Will you plaze put some more beans on my shtick?\"\r\n\r\n    A French physician styles spinach, _le balai de l'estomac_ (broom of\r\n    the stomach).\r\n\r\n    An ox is satisfied with the pasture of an acre or two; one wood\r\n    suffices for several elephants. Man alone supports himself by the\r\n    pillage of the whole earth and sea. What? Has Nature indeed given us\r\n    so insatiable a stomach, while she has given us so insignificant\r\n    bodies? No; it is not the hunger of our stomachs, but insatiable\r\n    covetousness which costs so much.--_Seneca._\r\n\r\n    The oftener we go to the vegetable world for our food, the oftener\r\n    we go to the first and therefore the cheapest source of supply. The\r\n    tendencies of all advanced scholars in thrift should be to find out\r\n    plans for feeding all the community, as far as possible, direct from\r\n    the lap of earth; to impress science into our service so that she\r\n    may prepare the choicest viands minus the necessity of making a\r\n    lower animal the living laboratory for the sake of what is just a\r\n    little higher than cannibal propensities.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _--Dr. B.W. Richardson._\r\n\r\n\r\nA VOICE FROM THE CORN.\r\n\r\n     I was made to be eaten, not to be drank,\r\n     To be husked in a barn, not soaked in a tank;\r\n     I come as a blessing when put in a mill,\r\n     As a blight and a curse when run through a still.\r\n     Make me up into loaves, and your children are fed;\r\n     But made into drink, I will starve them instead.\r\n     In bread I'm a servant the eater shall rule,\r\n     In drink I'm a master, the drinker a fool.\r\n     Then remember my warning; my strength I'll employ,\r\n     If eaten, to strengthen, if drunk, to destroy.\r\n\r\n    --_Sel._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUPS\r\n\r\nSoup is an easily made, economical, and when properly prepared from\r\nhealthful and nutritious material, very wholesome article of diet,\r\ndeserving of much more general use than is commonly accorded it.\r\n\r\nIn general, when soup is mentioned, some preparation of meat and bones\r\nis supposed to be meant; but we shall treat in this chapter of a quite\r\ndifferent class of soups, viz., those prepared from the grains, legumes,\r\nand vegetables, without the previous preparation of a \"stock.\" Soups of\r\nthis character are in every way equal, and in many points superior to\r\nthose made from meat and bones. If we compare the two, we shall find\r\nthat soups made from the grains and legumes rank much higher in\r\nnutritive value than do meat soups. For the preparation of the latter,\r\none pound of meat and bones, in about equal proportion, is required for\r\neach quart of soup. In the bone, there is little or no nourishment, it\r\nbeing valuable simply for the gelatine it contains, which gives\r\nconsistency to the soup; so in reality there is only one half pound of\r\nmaterial containing nutriment, for the quart of soup. Suppose, in\r\ncomparison we take a pea soup. One half pound of peas will be amply\r\nenough for a quart. As we take an equal amount of material as basis for\r\neach soup, we can easily determine their relative value by comparing the\r\namount of nutritive material contained in peas with that of beef, the\r\nmost commonly used material for meat soups. As will be seen by reference\r\nto the table of food analyses on page 486, peas contain 87.3 parts\r\nnutritive material, while lean beef contains only 28 parts in one\r\nhundred. Thus the pea soup contains more than three times as much\r\nnourishment as does the beef soup.\r\n\r\nSoups prepared from grains and legumes are no more expensive than meat\r\nsoups, and many kinds cost much less, while they have the added\r\nadvantage of requiring less time and no more labor to prepare.\r\n\r\nThe greater bulk of all meat soups is water, holding in solution the\r\nessence of meat, the nutritive value of which is of very doubtful\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nWhen properly prepared, the solid matter which enters into the\r\ncomposition of vegetable soups, is so broken up in the process of\r\ncooking, that it is more easily digested than in any other form.\r\n\r\nTaken hot at the beginning of a meal, soup stimulates the flow of the\r\ndigestive juices, and on account of the bulk, brings a sense of satiety\r\nbefore an excessive quantity of food has been taken.\r\n\r\nIn preparing soups from grains, legumes, and vegetables, the material\r\nshould be first cooked in the ordinary manner, using as small an amount\r\nof water as practicable, so as the more thoroughly to disintegrate or\r\nbreak it up. If the material be legumes or grains, the cooking should be\r\nslow and prolonged. The purpose to be attained in the cooking of all\r\nfoods is the partial digestion of the food elements; and in general,\r\nwith these foods, the more slowly (if continuous) the cooking is done,\r\nthe more completely will this be brought about.\r\n\r\nWhen the material is cooked, the next step is to make it homogeneous\r\nthroughout, and to remove any skins or cellulose material it may\r\ncontain. To do this, it should be put through a colander. The kind of\r\ncolander depends upon the material. Peas and beans require a fine\r\ncolander, since the skins, of which we are seeking to rid them, would\r\neasily go through a coarse one. To aid in this sifting process, if the\r\nmaterial be at all dry, a small quantity of liquid may be added from\r\ntime to time. When the colander process is complete, a sufficient amount\r\nof milk or other liquid may be added to make the whole of the\r\nconsistency of rather thick cream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chinese Soup Strainer.]\r\n\r\nIf the material is now cold, it must be reheated, and the salt, if any\r\nis to be used, added. The quantity of salt will depend somewhat upon the\r\ntaste of the consumer; but in general, one half teaspoonful to the pint\r\nof soup will be an ample supply. If any particular flavor, as of onion\r\nor celery, is desired, it may be imparted to the soup by adding to it a\r\nslice of onion or a few stalks of celery, allowing them to remain during\r\nthe reheating. By the time the soup is well heated, it will be\r\ndelicately flavored, and the pieces of onion or celery may be removed\r\nwith a fork or a skimmer. It is better, in general, to cook the soup all\r\nthat is needed before flavoring, since if allowed to boil, all delicate\r\nflavors are apt to be lost by evaporation. When reheated, add to the\r\nsoup a quantity of cream as seasoning, in the proportion of one cup of\r\nthin cream for every quart or three pints of soup.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the possibility of any lumps or fragments in the soup, pour it\r\nagain through a colander or a Chinese soup strainer into the soup\r\ntureen, and serve. It is well to take the precaution first to heat the\r\nstrainer and tureen, that the soup be not cooled during the process.\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to have the soup especially light and nice, beat or\r\nwhip the cream before adding, or beat the hot soup with an egg beater\r\nfor a few minutes after adding the cream. The well-beaten yolk of an egg\r\nfor every quart or three pints of soup, will answer as a very fair\r\nsubstitute for cream in potato, rice, and similar soups. It should not\r\nbe added to the body of the soup, but a cupful of the hot soup may be\r\nturned slowly onto the egg, stirring all the time, in order to mix it\r\nwell without curdling, and then the cupful stirred into the whole. Soups\r\nmade from legumes are excellent without cream.\r\n\r\nThe consistency of the soup when done should be about that of single\r\ncream, and equal throughout, containing no lumps or fragments of\r\nmaterial. If it is too thick, it may be easily diluted with hot milk or\r\nwater; if too thin, it will require the addition of more material, or\r\nmay be thickened with a little flour or cornstarch rubbed to a cream\r\nwith a small quantity of milk, used in the proportion of one\r\ntablespoonful for a quart of soup,--heaping, if flour; scant, if\r\ncornstarch,--and remembering always to boil the soup five or ten minutes\r\nafter the flour is added, that there may be no raw taste.\r\n\r\nThe addition of the flour or cornstarch gives a smoothness to their\r\nconsistency which is especially desirable for some soups. A few\r\nspoonfuls of cooked oatmeal or cracked wheat, added and rubbed through\r\nthe colander with the other material, is valuable for the same purpose.\r\nBrowned flour prepared by spreading a cupful thinly on shallow tins, and\r\nplacing in a moderately hot oven, stirring frequently until lightly and\r\nevenly browned, is excellent to use both for thickening and flavoring\r\ncertain soups.\r\n\r\nIf whole grains, macaroni, vermicelli, or shredded vegetables are to be\r\nused in the soup, cook them separately, and add to the soup just before\r\nserving.\r\n\r\nThe nutritive value of soup depends of course upon its ingredients, and\r\nthese should be so chosen and combined as to produce the best possible\r\nfood from the material employed. Milk is a valuable factor in the\r\npreparation of soups. With such vegetables as potatoes, parsnips, and\r\nothers of the class composed largely of starch, and containing but a\r\nsmall proportion of the nitrogenous food elements, its use is especially\r\nimportant as an addition to their food value, as also to their\r\npalatableness. Very good soups may, however, be made from legumes, if\r\ncarefully cooked with water only.\r\n\r\nSoups offer a most economical way of making use of the \"left-over\"\r\nfragments which might otherwise be consigned to the refuse bucket. A\r\npint of cold mashed potatoes, a cupful of stewed beans, a spoonful or\r\ntwo of boiled rice, stewed tomatoes, or other bits of vegetables and\r\ngrains, are quite as good for soup purposes as fresh material, provided\r\nthey have been preserved fresh and sweet. To insure this it is always\r\nbest to put them away in clean dishes; if retained in the dish from\r\nwhich they were served, the thin smears and small crumbs on the sides\r\nwhich spoil much sooner than the larger portion, will help to spoil the\r\nrest. One may find some difficulty in rubbing them through the colander\r\nunless they are first moistened. Measure the cold food, and then\r\ndetermine how much liquid will be needed, and add a part of this before\r\nattempting to put through the colander.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to give specific directions for making soups of\r\nfragments, as the remnants to be utilized will vary so much in character\r\nas to make such inapplicable, but the recipes given for combination\r\nsoups will perhaps serve as an aid in this direction. Where a sufficient\r\namount of one kind of food is left over to form the basis of a soup or\r\nto serve as a seasoning, it can be used in every way the same as fresh\r\nmaterial. When, however, there is but a little of various odds and ends,\r\nthe general rule to be observed is to combine only such materials as\r\nharmonize in taste.\r\n\r\nSoups prepared from the grains, legumes, and vegetables, are so largely\r\ncomposed of food material that it is important that they be retained in\r\nthe mouth long enough for proper insalivation; and in order to insure\r\nthis, it is well to serve with the soup _croutons_, prepared by cutting\r\nstale bread into small squares or cubes, and browning thoroughly in a\r\nmoderate oven. Put a spoonful or two of the _croutons_ in each plate,\r\nand turn the hot soup over them. This plan also serves another\r\npurpose,--that of providing a means whereby the left-over bits of stale\r\nbread may be utilized to advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nASPARAGUS SOUP.--Wash two bunches of fresh asparagus carefully, and\r\ncut into small pieces. Put to cook in a quart of boiling water, and\r\nsimmer gently till perfectly tender, when there should remain about a\r\npint of the liquor. Turn into a colander, and rub all through except the\r\nhard portion. To a pint of asparagus mixture add salt and one cup of\r\nthin cream and a pint of milk; boil up for a few minutes, and serve.\r\n\r\nBAKED BEAN SOUP.--Soak a half pint of white beans over night. In\r\nthe morning turn off the water, and place them in an earthen dish with\r\ntwo or two and one half quarts of boiling water; cover and let them\r\nsimmer in a moderate oven four or five hours. Also soak over night a\r\ntablespoonful of pearl tapioca in sufficient water to cover. When the\r\nbeans are soft, rub through a colander, after which add the soaked\r\ntapioca, and salt if desired; also as much powdered thyme as can be\r\ntaken on the point of a penknife and sufficient water to make the soup\r\nof proper consistency if the water has mostly evaporated. Return to the\r\noven, and cook one half hour longer. A little cream may be added just\r\nbefore serving.\r\n\r\nBEAN AND CORN SOUP.--Cold boiled or stewed corn and cold baked\r\nbeans form the basis of this soup. Take one pint of each, rub through a\r\ncolander, add a slice of onion, three cups of boiling water or milk, and\r\nboil for ten minutes. Turn through the colander a second time to remove\r\nthe onion and any lumps or skins which may remain. Season with salt and\r\na half cup of cream. If preferred, the onion may be omitted.\r\n\r\nBEAN AND HOMINY SOUP.--Soak separately in cold water over night a\r\ncupful each of dry beans and hominy. In the morning, boil them together\r\ntill both are perfectly tender and broken to pieces. Rub through a\r\ncolander, and add sufficient milk to make three pints. Season with salt,\r\nand stir in a cup of whipped cream just before serving. Cold beans and\r\nhominy may be utilized for this soup.\r\n\r\nBEAN AND POTATO SOUP.--Soak a half pint of dry white beans over\r\nnight; in the morning drain and put to cook in boiling water. When\r\ntender, rub through a colander. Prepare sliced potato sufficient to make\r\none quart, cook in as small a quantity of water as possible, rub\r\nthrough a colander, and add to the beans. Add milk or water sufficient\r\nto make two quarts, and as much prepared thyme as can be taken on the\r\npoint of a penknife, with salt to season. Boil for a few minutes, add a\r\nteacup of thin cream, and serve.\r\n\r\nBEAN AND TOMATO SOUP.--Take one pint of boiled or a little less of\r\nmashed beans, one pint of stewed tomatoes, and rub together through a\r\ncolander. Add salt, a cup of thin cream, one half a cup of nicely\r\nsteamed rice, and sufficient boiling water to make a soup of the proper\r\nconsistency. Reheat and serve.\r\n\r\nBLACK BEAN SOUP.--Soak a pint of black beans over night in cold\r\nwater. When ready to cook, put into two and one half quarts of fresh\r\nwater, which should be boiling, and simmer until completely dissolved,\r\nadding more boiling water from time to time if needed. There should be\r\nabout two quarts of all when done. Rub through a colander, add salt, a\r\nhalf cup of cream, and reheat. When hot, turn through a soup strainer,\r\nadd two or more teaspoonfuls of lemon juice, and serve.\r\n\r\nBLACK BEAN SOUP NO. 2.--Soak a pint of black beans in water over\r\nnight. Cook in boiling water until tender, then rub through a colander.\r\nAdd sufficient boiling water to make about two quarts in all. Add salt,\r\nand one half a small onion cut in slices to flavor. Turn into a double\r\nboiler and reheat. When sufficiently flavored, remove the onion with a\r\nskimmer, thicken the soup with two teaspoonfuls of browned flour, turn\r\nthrough the soup strainer and serve. If desired, a half cup of cream may\r\nbe added, and the onion flavor omitted.\r\n\r\nBRAN STOCK.--For every quart of stock desired, boil a cup of good\r\nwheat bran in three pints of water for two or three hours or until\r\nreduced one third. This stock may be made the base of a variety of\r\npalatable and nutritious soups by flavoring with different vegetables\r\nand seasoning with salt and cream. An excellent soup may be prepared by\r\nflavoring the stock with celery, or by the addition of a quantity of\r\nstrained stewed tomato sufficient to disguise the taste of the stock. It\r\nis also valuable in giving consistence to soups, in the preparation of\r\nsome of which it may be advantageously used in place of other liquid.\r\n\r\nBROWN SOUP.--Simmer together two pints of sliced potatoes and one\r\nthird as much of the thin brown shavings (not thicker than a silver\r\ndime) from the top of a loaf of whole-wheat bread, in one quart of\r\nwater. The crust must not be burned or blackened, and must not include\r\nany of the soft portion of the loaf. When the potatoes are tender, mash\r\nall through a colander. Flavor with a cup of strained, stewed tomatoes,\r\na little salt, and return to the fire; when hot, add a half cup of\r\ncream, and boiling water to make the soup of proper consistency, and\r\nserve at once. If care has been taken to prepare the crust as directed,\r\nthis soup will have a brown color and a fine, pungent flavor exceedingly\r\npleasant to the taste.\r\n\r\nCANNED GREEN PEA SOUP.--Rub a can of green peas through a colander\r\nto remove the skins. Add a pint of milk and heat to boiling. If too\r\nthin, thicken with a little flour rubbed smooth in a very little cold\r\nmilk. Season with salt and a half cup of cream. A small teaspoonful of\r\nwhite sugar may be added if desired.\r\n\r\nGreen peas, instead of canned, may be used when procurable. When they\r\nhave become a little too hard to serve alone, they can be used for soup,\r\nif thoroughly cooked.\r\n\r\nCANNED CORN SOUP.--Open a can of green corn, turn it into a\r\ngranite-ware dish, and thoroughly mash with a potato-masher until each\r\nkernel is broken, then rub through a colander to remove the skins. Add\r\nsufficient rich milk to make the soup of the desired consistency, about\r\none half pint for each pint can of corn will be needed. Season with\r\nsalt, reheat, and serve. If preferred, a larger quantity of milk and\r\nsome cream may be used, and the soup, when reheated, thickened with a\r\nlittle corn starch or flour. It may be turned through the colander a\r\nsecond time or not, as preferred.\r\n\r\nCARROT SOUP.--For a quart of soup, slice one large carrot and boil\r\nin a small quantity of water for two hours or longer, then rub it\r\nthrough a colander, add a quart of rich milk, and salt to season.\r\nReheat, and when boiling, thicken with two teaspoonfuls of flour rubbed\r\nsmooth in a little cold milk.\r\n\r\nCELERY SOUP.--Chop quite fine enough fresh, crisp celery to make a\r\npint, and cook it until tender in a very little boiling water. When\r\ndone, heat three cupfuls of rich milk, part cream if it can be afforded,\r\nto boiling, add the celery, salt to season, and thicken the whole with a\r\ntablespoonful of flour rubbed smooth in a little cold milk; or add to\r\nthe milk before heating a cupful of mashed potato, turn through a\r\ncolander to remove lumps, reheat, add salt and the celery, and serve.\r\n\r\nCELERY SOUP NO. 2.--Cook in a double boiler a cupful of cracked\r\nwheat in three pints of water for three or four hours. Rub the wheat\r\nthrough a colander, add a cup of rich milk, and if needed, a little\r\nboiling water, and a small head of celery cut in finger lengths. Boil\r\nall together for fifteen or twenty minutes, until well flavored, remove\r\nthe celery with a fork, add salt, and serve with or without the\r\nhard-boiled yolk of an egg in each soup plate.\r\n\r\nCHESTNUT SOUP.--Shell and blanch a pint of Italian chestnuts, as\r\ndirected on page 215, and cook in boiling milk until tender. Rub the\r\nnuts through a colander, add salt and sufficient milk and cream to make\r\na soup of the proper consistency, reheat and serve.\r\n\r\nCOMBINATION SOUP.--This soup is prepared from material already\r\ncooked, and requires two cups of cracked wheat, one and one half cups of\r\nLima beans, one half cup of black beans, and one cup of stewed tomato.\r\nRub the material together through a colander, adding, if needed, a\r\nlittle hot water to facilitate the sifting. Add boiling water to thin to\r\nthe proper consistency, season with salt and if it can be afforded a\r\nlittle sweet cream,--the soup is, however, very palatable without the\r\ncream.\r\n\r\nCOMBINATION SOUP NO. 2.--Take three and one half cups of mashed\r\n(Scotch) peas, one cup each of cooked rice, oatmeal, and hominy, and two\r\ncups of stewed tomato. Rub the material through a colander, add boiling\r\nwater to thin to the proper consistency, season with salt, reheat, and\r\nadd, just before serving, two cups of cooked macaroni. If preferred, a\r\ncup of cream may be used in place of the tomato, or both may be omitted.\r\n\r\nANOTHER.--One half cup of cold mashed potato, one cup each of\r\ncooked pearl wheat, barley and dried peas. Rub all through a colander,\r\nadd boiling milk to thin to the proper consistency, season with salt and\r\na half cup of cream.\r\n\r\nANOTHER.--Take three cups of cooked oatmeal, two of mashed white\r\nbeans, and one of stewed tomato. Rub the ingredients through a colander,\r\nadd boiling milk to thin to the proper consistency, season with salt and\r\na little cream.\r\n\r\nCREAM PEA SOUP.--Soak three fourths of a pint of dried Scotch peas\r\nover night in a quart of water. In the morning put to cook in boiling\r\nwater, cover closely and let them simmer gently four or five hours, or\r\nuntil the peas are very tender and well disintegrated; then rub through\r\na colander to remove the skins. If the peas are very dry, add a little\r\nwater or milk occasionally, to moisten them and facilitate the sifting.\r\nJust before the peas are done, prepare potatoes enough to make a pint\r\nand a half, after being cut in thin slices. Cook the potatoes until\r\ntender in a small amount of water, and rub them through a colander. Add\r\nthe potatoes thus prepared to the sifted peas, and milk enough to make\r\nthree and one half pints in all. Return to the fire, and add a small\r\nhead of celery cut finger lengths, and let the whole simmer together ten\r\nor fifteen minutes, until flavored. Remove the celery with a fork, add\r\nsalt and a cup of thin cream. This should make about two quarts of soup.\r\nIf preferred, the peas may be cooked without soaking. It will, however,\r\nrequire a little longer time.\r\n\r\nCREAM BARLEY SOUP.--Wash a cup of pearl barley, drain and simmer\r\nslowly in two quarts of water for four or five hours, adding boiling\r\nwater from time to time as needed. When the barley is tender, strain off\r\nthe liquor, of which there should be about three pints; add to it a\r\nportion of the cooked barley grains, salt, and a cup of whipped cream,\r\nand serve. If preferred, the beaten yolk of an egg may be used instead\r\nof cream.\r\n\r\nGREEN CORN SOUP.--Take six well-filled ears of tender green corn.\r\nRun a sharp knife down the rows and split each grain; then with the back\r\nof a knife, scraping from the large to the small end of the ear, press\r\nout the pulp, leaving the hulls on the cob. Break the cobs if long, put\r\nthem in cold water sufficient to cover, and boil half an hour. Strain\r\noff the water, of which there should be at least one pint. Put the corn\r\nwater on again, and when boiling add the corn pulp, and cook fifteen\r\nminutes, or until the raw taste is destroyed. Rub through a rather\r\ncoarse colander, add salt and a pint of hot unskimmed milk; if too thin,\r\nthicken with a little cornstarch or flour, boil up, and serve. If\r\npreferred, a teaspoonful of sugar may be added to the soup. A small\r\nquantity of cooked macaroni, cut in rings, makes a very pretty and\r\npalatable addition to the soup. The soup is also excellent flavored with\r\ncelery.\r\n\r\nGREEN PEA SOUP.--Gently simmer two quarts of shelled peas in\r\nsufficient water to cook, leaving almost no juice when tender. Rub\r\nthrough a colander, moistening if necessary with a little cold milk. Add\r\nto the sifted peas an equal quantity of rich milk and a small onion cut\r\nin halves. Boil all together five or ten minutes until the soup is\r\ndelicately flavored, then remove the onion with a skimmer; add salt if\r\ndesired, and serve. If preferred, a half cup of thin cream may be added\r\njust before serving. Celery may be used in place of the onion, or both\r\nmay be omitted.\r\n\r\nGREEN BEAN SOUP.--Prepare a quart of fresh string beans by pulling\r\noff ends and strings and breaking into small pieces. Boil in a small\r\nquantity of water. If the beans are fresh and young, three pints will be\r\nsufficient; if wilted or quite old, more will be needed, as they will\r\nrequire longer cooking. There should be about a teacupful and a half of\r\nliquid left when the beans are perfectly tender and boiled in pieces.\r\nRub through a colander, return to the kettle, and for each cup of the\r\nbean pulp add salt, a cup and a half of unskimmed milk; boil together\r\nfor a few minutes, thicken with a little flour, and serve. The quart of\r\nbeans should be sufficient for three pints of soup.\r\n\r\nKORNLET SOUP.--Kornlet or canned green corn pulp, may be made into\r\na most appetizing soup in a few minutes by adding to a pint of kornlet\r\nan equal quantity of rich milk, heating to boiling, and thickening it\r\nwith a teaspoonful of flour rubbed smooth in a little cold milk.\r\n\r\nKORNLET AND TOMATO SOUP.--Put together equal quantities of kornlet\r\nand strained stewed tomato, season with salt and heat to boiling; add\r\nfor each quart one fourth to one half cup of hot thin cream, thicken\r\nwith a tablespoonful of flour rubbed smooth in a little water, and\r\nserve. Cooked corn rubbed through a colander may also be used for this\r\nsoup.\r\n\r\nLENTIL SOUP.--Simmer a pint of lentils in water until tender. If\r\ndesired to have the soup less dark in color and less strong in flavor,\r\nthe lentils may be first parboiled for a half hour, and then drained and\r\nput into fresh boiling water. Much valuable nutriment is thus lost,\r\nhowever. When perfectly tender, mash through a colander to remove all\r\nskins; add salt and a cup of thin cream, and it too thick, sufficient\r\nboiling milk or water to thin to the proper consistency, heat again to\r\nboiling, and serve. If preferred, an additional quantity of liquid may\r\nbe added and the soup slightly thickened with browned flour.\r\n\r\nLENTIL AND PARSNIP SOUP.--Cook together one pint of lentils and one\r\nhalf a small parsnip, sliced, until tender in a small quantity of\r\nboiling water. When done, rub through a colander, and add boiling water\r\nto make a soup of the proper consistency. Season with salt and if\r\ndesired a little cream.\r\n\r\nLIMA BEAN SOUP.--Simmer a pint of Lima beans gently in just\r\nsufficient water to cook and not burn, until they have fallen to pieces.\r\nAdd more boiling water as needed. When done, rub the beans through a\r\ncolander. Add rich milk or water to make of the proper consistency, and\r\nsalt to season; reheat and serve. White beans may be used in place of\r\nLima beans, but they require more prolonged cooking. A heaping\r\ntablespoonful of pearl tapioca or sago previously soaked in cold water,\r\nmay be added to the soup when it is reheated, if liked, and the whole\r\ncooked until the sago is transparent.\r\n\r\nMACARONI SOUP.--Heat a quart of milk, to which has been added a\r\ntablespoonful of finely grated bread crust (the brown part only, from\r\nthe top of the loaf) and a slice of onion to flavor, in a double boiler.\r\nWhen the milk is well flavored, remove the onion, turn through a\r\ncolander, add salt, and thicken with two teaspoonfuls of flour rubbed\r\nsmooth in a little cold milk. Lastly add one cupful of cooked macaroni,\r\nand serve.\r\n\r\nOATMEAL SOUP.--Put two heaping tablespoonfuls of oatmeal into a\r\nquart of boiling water, and cook in a double boiler for two hours or\r\nlonger. Strain as for gruel, add salt if desired, and two or three\r\nstalks of celery broken into finger lengths, and cook again until the\r\nwhole is well flavored with the celery, which may then be removed with a\r\nfork; add a half cup of cream, and the soup is ready to serve. Cold\r\noatmeal mush may be thinned with milk, reheated, strained, flavored, and\r\nmade into soup the same as fresh material. A slice or two of onion may\r\nbe used with the celery for flavoring the soup if desired, or a cup of\r\nstrained stewed tomato may be added.\r\n\r\nPARSNIP SOUP.--Take a quart of well scraped, thinly sliced\r\nparsnips, one cup of bread crust shavings (prepared as for Brown Soup),\r\none head of celery, one small onion, and one pint of sliced potatoes.\r\nThe parsnips used should be young and tender, so that they will cook in\r\nabout the same length of time as the other vegetables. Use only\r\nsufficient water to cook them. When done, rub through a colander and add\r\nsalt and sufficient rich milk, part cream if desired, to make of the\r\nproper consistency. Reheat and serve.\r\n\r\nPARSNIP SOUP NO. 2.--Wash, pare, and slice equal quantities of\r\nparsnips and potatoes. Cook, closely covered, in a small quantity of\r\nwater until soft. If the parsnips are not young and tender, they must be\r\nput to cook first, and the potatoes added when they are half done. Mash\r\nthrough a colander. Add salt, and milk to make of the proper\r\nconsistency, season with cream, reheat and serve.\r\n\r\nPEA AND TOMATO SOUP.--Soak one pint of Scotch peas over night. When\r\nready to cook, put into a quart of boiling water and simmer slowly until\r\nquite dry and well disintegrated. Rub through a colander to remove the\r\nskins. Add a pint of hot water, one cup of mashed potato, two cups of\r\nstrained stewed tomato, and one cup of twelve-hour cream. Turn into a\r\ndouble-boiler and cook together for a half hour or longer; turn a second\r\ntime through a colander or soup strainer and serve. The proportions\r\ngiven are quite sufficient for two quarts of soup. There may need to be\r\nsome variation in the quantity of tomato to be used, depending upon its\r\nthickness. If very thin, a larger quantity and less water will be\r\nneeded. The soup should be a rich reddish brown in color when done. The\r\npeas may be cooked without being first soaked, if preferred.\r\n\r\nPLAIN RICE SOUP.--Wash and pick over four tablespoonfuls of rice,\r\nput it in an earthen dish with a quart of water, and place in a moderate\r\noven. When the water is all absorbed, add a quart of rich milk, and salt\r\nif desired; turn into a granite kettle and boil ten minutes, or till the\r\nrice is done. Add a half cup of sweet cream and serve. A slice of onion\r\nor stalk of celery can be boiled with the soup after putting in the\r\nkettle, and removed before serving, if desired to flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATO AND RICE SOUP.--Cook a quart of sliced potatoes in as little\r\nwater as possible. When done, rub through a colander. Add salt, a quart\r\nof rich milk, and reheat. If desired, season with a slice of onion, a\r\nstalk of celery, or a little parsley. Just before serving, add a half\r\ncup of cream and a cup and a half of well-cooked rice with unbroken\r\ngrains. Stir gently and serve at once.\r\n\r\nPOTATO SOUP.--For each quart of soup required, cook a pint of\r\nsliced potatoes in sufficient water to cover them. When tender, rub\r\nthrough a colander. Return to the fire, and add enough rich, sweet milk,\r\npart cream if it can be afforded to make a quart in all, and a little\r\nsalt. Let the soup come to a boil, and add a teaspoonful of flour or\r\ncorn starch, rubbed to a paste with a little water; boil a few minutes\r\nand serve. A cup and a half of cold mashed potato or a pint of sliced\r\nbaked potato can be used instead of fresh material; in which case add\r\nthe milk and heat before rubbing through the colander. A slice of onion\r\nor a stalk of celery may be simmered in the soup for a few minutes to\r\nflavor, and then removed with a skimmer or a spoon. A good mixed potato\r\nsoup is made by using one third sweet and two thirds Irish potatoes, in\r\nthe same manner as above.\r\n\r\nPOTATO AND VERMICELLI SOUP.--Breakup a cupful of vermicelli and\r\ndrop into boiling water. Let it cook for ten or fifteen minutes, and\r\nthen turn into a colander to drain. Have ready a potato soup prepared\r\nthe same as in the proceeding; stir the vermicelli lightly into it just\r\nbefore serving.\r\n\r\nSAGO AND POTATO SOUP.--Prepare the soup as directed for Potato\r\nSoup, from fresh or cold mashed potato, using a little larger quantity\r\nof milk or cream, as the sago adds thickness to the soap. When seasoned\r\nand ready to reheat, turn a second time through the colander, and add\r\nfor each quart of soup, one heaping tablespoonful of sago which has been\r\nsoaked for twenty minutes in just enough water to cover. Boil together\r\nfive or ten minutes, or until the sago is transparent, and serve.\r\n\r\nSCOTCH BROTH.--Soak over night two tablespoonfuls of pearl barley\r\nand one of coarse oatmeal, in water sufficient to cover them. In the\r\nmorning, put the grains, together with the water in which they were\r\nsoaked, into two quarts of water and simmer for several hours, adding\r\nboiling water as needed. About an hour before the soup is required, add\r\na turnip cut into small dice, a grated carrot, and one half cup of fine\r\npieces of the brown portion of the crust of a loaf of whole-wheat bread.\r\nRub all through a colander, and add salt, a cup of milk, and a half cup\r\nof thin cream. This should make about three pints of soup.\r\n\r\nSPLIT PEA SOUP.--For each quart of soup desired, simmer a cupful of\r\nsplit peas very slowly in three pints of boiling water for six hours, or\r\nuntil thoroughly dissolved. When done, rub through a colander, add salt\r\nand season with one half cup of thin cream. Reheat, and when boiling,\r\nstir into it two teaspoonfuls of flour rubbed smooth in a little cold\r\nwater. Boil up until thickened, and serve. If preferred, the cream may\r\nbe omitted and the soup flavored with a little celery or onion.\r\n\r\nSWEET POTATO SOUP.--To a pint of cold mashed sweet potato add a\r\npint and a half of strained stewed tomato, rub together through a\r\ncolander, add salt to season, and half a cup of cream. Reheat and serve.\r\n\r\nSWISS POTATO SOUP.--Pare and cut up into small pieces, enough white\r\nturnips to fill a pint cup, and cook in a small quantity of water. When\r\ntender, add three pints of sliced potatoes, and let them boil together\r\nuntil of the consistency of mush. Add hot water if it has boiled away so\r\nthat there is not sufficient to cook the potatoes. When done, drain,\r\nrub through a colander, add a pint and a half of milk and a cup of thin\r\ncream, salt if desired, and if too thick, a little more milk or a\r\nsufficient quantity of hot water to make it of the proper consistency.\r\nThis should be sufficient for two and a half quarts of soup.\r\n\r\nSWISS LENTIL SOUP.--Cook a pint of brown lentils in a small\r\nquantity of boiling water. Add to the lentils when about half done, one\r\nmedium sized onion cut in halves or quarters. When the lentils are\r\ntender, remove the onion with a fork, and rub the lentils through a\r\ncolander. Add sufficient boiling water to make three pints in all.\r\nSeason with salt, reheat to boiling, and thicken the whole with four\r\ntable spoonfuls of browned flour, rubbed to a cream in a little cold\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nTOMATO AND MACARONI SOUP.--Break a half dozen sticks of macaroni\r\ninto small pieces, and drop into boiling water. Cook for an hour, or\r\nuntil perfectly tender. Rub two quarts of stewed or canned tomatoes\r\nthrough a colander, to remove all seeds and fragments. When the macaroni\r\nis done, drain thoroughly, cut each piece into tiny rings, and add it to\r\nthe strained tomatoes. Season with salt, and boil for a few minutes. If\r\ndesired, just before serving add a cup of thin cream, boil up once, and\r\nserve immediately. If the tomato is quite thin, the soup should be\r\nslightly thickened with a little flour before adding the macaroni.\r\n\r\nTOMATO CREAM SOUP.--Heat two quarts of strained, stewed tomatoes to\r\nboiling; add four tablespoonfuls of flour rubbed smooth in a little cold\r\nwater. Let the tomatoes boil until thickened, stirring constantly that\r\nno lumps form; add salt to season. Have ready two cups of hot rich milk\r\nor thin cream. Add the cream or milk hot, and let all boil together for\r\na minute or two, then serve.\r\n\r\nTOMATO AND OKRA SOUP.--Take one quart of okra thinly sliced, and\r\ntwo quarts of sliced tomatoes. Simmer gently from one to two hours. Rub\r\nthrough a colander, heat again to boiling, season with salt and cream if\r\ndesired, and serve.\r\n\r\nCanned okra and tomatoes need only to be rubbed through a colander,\r\nscalded and seasoned, to make a most excellent soup. If preferred, one\r\nor two potatoes may be sliced and cooked, rubbed through a colander, and\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nTOMATO SOUP WITH VERMICELLI.--Cook a cupful of broken vermicelli in\r\na pint of boiling water for ten minutes. Turn into a colander to drain.\r\nHave boiling two quarts of strained, stewed tomatoes, to which add the\r\nvermicelli. If preferred, the tomato may be thickened slightly with a\r\nlittle cornstarch rubbed smooth in cold water before adding the\r\nvermicelli. Salt to taste, and just before serving turn in a cup of hot,\r\nthin cream. Let all boil up for a moment, then serve at once.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE OYSTER SOUP.--Scrape all the outer covering and small\r\nrootlets from vegetable oysters, and lay them in a pan of cold water to\r\nprevent discoloration. The scraping can be done much easier if the roots\r\nare allowed first to stand in cold water for an hour or so. Slice rather\r\nthin, enough to make one quart, and put to cook in a quart of water. Let\r\nthem boil slowly until very tender. Add a pint of milk, a cup of thin\r\ncream, salt, and when boiling, a tablespoonful or two of flour, rubbed\r\nto a cream with a little milk. Let the soup boil a few minutes until\r\nthickened, and serve.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE SOUP.--Simmer together slowly for three or four hours, in\r\nfive quarts of water, a quart of split peas, a slice of carrot, a slice\r\nof white turnip, one cup of canned tomatoes, and two stalks of celery\r\ncut into small bits. When done, rub through a colander, add milk to make\r\nof proper consistency, reheat, season with salt and cream, and serve.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE SOUP NO. 2.--Prepare and slice a pint of vegetable\r\noysters and a pint and a half of potatoes. Put the oysters to cook\r\nfirst, in sufficient water to cook both. When nearly done, add the\r\npotatoes and cook all till tender. Rub through a colander, or if\r\npreferred, remove the pieces of oysters, and rub the potato only through\r\nthe colander, together with the water in which the oysters were cooked,\r\nas that will contain all the flavor. Return to the fire, and add salt, a\r\npint of strained, stewed tomatoes, and when boiling, the sliced oysters\r\nif desired, a cup of thin cream and a cup of milk, both previously\r\nheated; serve at once.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE SOUP NO. 3.--Soak a cupful of white beans over night in\r\ncold water. When ready to cook, put into fresh boiling water and simmer\r\nuntil tender. When nearly done, add three large potatoes sliced, two or\r\nthree slices of white turnip, and one large parsnip cut in slices. When\r\ndone, rub through a colander, add milk or water to make of proper\r\nconsistency, season with salt and cream, reheat and serve. This quantity\r\nof material is sufficient for two quarts of soup.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE SOUP NO. 4.--Prepare a quart of bran stock as previously\r\ndirected. Heat to boiling, and add to it one teaspoonful of grated\r\ncarrot, a slice of onion, and a half cup of tomato. Cook together in a\r\ndouble boiler for half an hour. Remove the slice of onion, and add salt\r\nand a half cup of turnip previously cooked and cut in small dice.\r\n\r\nVELVET SOUP.--Pour three pints of hot potato soup, seasoned to\r\ntaste, slowly over the well-beaten yolks of two eggs, stirring briskly\r\nto mix the egg perfectly with the soup. It must not be reheated after\r\nadding the egg. Plain rice or barley soup may be used in place of potato\r\nsoup, if preferred.\r\n\r\nVERMICELLI SOUP.--Lightly fill a cup with broken vermicelli. Turn\r\nit into a pint of boiling water, and cook for ten or fifteen minutes.\r\nDrain off all the hot water and put into cold water for a few minutes.\r\nTurn into a colander and drain again; add three pints of milk, salt to\r\ntaste, and heat to boiling. Have the yolks of three eggs well beaten,\r\nand when the soup is boiling, turn it gradually onto the eggs, stirring\r\nbriskly that they may not curdle. Return to the kettle, reheat nearly to\r\nboiling, and serve at once.\r\n\r\nVERMICELLI SOUP NO. 2.--Cook a cupful of sliced vegetable oysters,\r\na stalk or two of celery, two slices of onion, a parsnip, and half a\r\ncarrot in water just sufficient to cover well. Meanwhile put a cupful of\r\nvermicelli in a quart of milk and cook in a double boiler until tender.\r\nWhen the vegetables are done, strain off the broth and add it to the\r\nvermicelli when cooked. Season with salt and a cup of cream. Beat two\r\neggs light and turn the boiling soup on the eggs, stirring briskly that\r\nthey may not curdle. Reheat if not thickened, and serve.\r\n\r\nWHITE CELERY SOUP.--Cut two heads of celery into finger lengths,\r\nand simmer in a quart of milk for half an hour. Remove the pieces of\r\ncelery with a skimmer. Thicken the soup with a tablespoonful of\r\ncornstarch braided with a little milk, add salt if desired, and a teacup\r\nof whipped cream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE TOPICS.\r\n\r\n    Soup rejoices the stomach, and disposes it to receive and digest\r\n    other food.--_Brillat Savarin._\r\n\r\n    To work the head, temperance must be carried into the\r\n    diet.--_Beecher._\r\n\r\n    To fare well implies the partaking of such food as does not disagree\r\n    with body or mind. Hence only those fare well who live\r\n    temperately.--_Socrates._\r\n\r\n    The aliments to which the cook's art gives a liquid or semi-liquid\r\n    form, are in general more digestible.--_Dictionaire de Medicine._\r\n\r\n    In the most heroic days of the Grecian army, their food was the\r\n    plain and simple produce of the soil. When the public games of\r\n    ancient Greece were first instituted, the _athleta_, in accordance\r\n    with the common dietetic habits of the people, were trained entirely\r\n    on vegetable food.\r\n\r\n    The eating of much flesh fills us with a multitude of evil diseases\r\n    and multitudes of evil desires.--_Perphyrises, 233 A.D._\r\n\r\n     No flocks that range the valley free\r\n     To slaughter I condemn;\r\n     Taught by the Power that pities me,\r\n     I learn to pity them.\r\n     But from the mountain's grassy side\r\n     A guiltless feast I bring;\r\n     A scrip with herbs and fruits supplied\r\n     And water from the spring.\r\n\r\n    --_Goldsmith._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBREAKFAST DISHES\r\n\r\nA good breakfast is the best capital upon which people who have real\r\nwork to do in the world can begin the day. If the food is well selected\r\nand well cooked, it furnishes both cheer and strength for their daily\r\ntasks. Poor food, or good food poorly prepared, taxes the digestive\r\npowers more than is due, and consequently robs brain and nerves of\r\nvigor. Good food is not rich food, in the common acceptation of the\r\nterm; it is such food as furnishes the requisite nutriment with the\r\nleast fatigue to the digestive powers. It is of the best material,\r\nprepared in the best manner, and with pleasant variety, though it may be\r\nvery simple.\r\n\r\n\"What to get for breakfast\" is one of the most puzzling problems which\r\nthe majority of housewives have to solve. The usually limited time for\r\nits preparation requires that it be something easily and quickly\r\nprepared; and health demands that the bill of fare be of such articles\r\nas require but minimum time for digestion, that the stomach may have\r\nchance for rest after the process of digestion is complete, before the\r\ndinner hour. The custom of using fried potatoes or mushes, salted fish\r\nor meats, and other foods almost impossible of digestion, for breakfast\r\ndishes, is most pernicious. These foods set completely at variance all\r\nlaws of breakfast hygiene. They are very difficult of digestion, and the\r\nthirst-provoking quality of salted foods makes them an important\r\nauxiliary to the acquirement of a love of intoxicating drinks. We feel\r\nvery sure that, as a prominent temperance writer says, \"It very often\r\nhappens that women who send out their loved ones with an agony of prayer\r\nthat they may be kept from drink for the day, also send them with a\r\nbreakfast that will make them almost frantic with thirst before they get\r\nto the first saloon.\"\r\n\r\nThe foods composing the breakfast _menu_ should be simple in character,\r\nwell and delicately cooked, and neatly served. Fruits and grains and\r\narticles made from them offer the requisites for the ideal breakfast.\r\nThese afford ample provision for variety, are easily made ready, and\r\neasily digested, while at the same time furnishing excellent nutriment\r\nin ample quantity and of the very best quality. Meats, most vegetables,\r\nand compound dishes, more difficult of digestion, are better reserved\r\nfor the dinner bill of fare. No vegetable except the potato is\r\nespecially serviceable as a breakfast food, and it is much more readily\r\ndigested when baked than when prepared in any other manner. Stewing\r\nrequires less time for preparation, but about one hour longer for\r\ndigestion.\r\n\r\nAs an introduction to the morning meal, fresh fruits are most desirable,\r\nparticularly the juicy varieties, as oranges, grape fruit, melons,\r\ngrapes, and peaches, some one of which are obtainable nearly the entire\r\nyear. Other fruits; such as apples, bananas, pears, etc., though less\r\nsuitable, may be used for the same purpose. They are, however, best\r\naccompanied with wafers or some hard food, to insure their thorough\r\nmastication.\r\n\r\nFor the second course, some of the various cereals, oatmeal, rye, corn,\r\nbarley, rice, or one of the numerous preparations of wheat, well cooked\r\nand served with cream, together with one or more unfermented breads\r\n(recipes for which have been given in a previous chapter), cooked\r\nfruits, and some simple relishes, are quite sufficient for a healthful\r\nand palatable breakfast.\r\n\r\nIf, however, a more extensive bill of fare is desired, numerous\r\ndelicious and appetizing toasts may be prepared according to the recipes\r\ngiven in this chapter, and which, because of their simple character and\r\nthe facility with which they can be prepared, are particularly suitable\r\nas breakfast dishes. The foundation of all these toasts is _zwieback_,\r\nor twice-baked bread, prepared from good whole-wheat or Graham fermented\r\nbread cut in uniform slices not more than a half inch thick, each slice\r\nbeing divided in halves, placed on tins, or what is better, the\r\nperforated sheets recommended for baking rolls, and baked or toasted in\r\na slow oven for a half hour or longer, until it is browned evenly\r\nthroughout the entire slice. The zwieback may be prepared in\r\nconsiderable quantity and kept on hand in readiness for use. It will\r\nkeep for any length of time if stored in a dry place.\r\n\r\nStale bread is the best for making zwieback, but it should be good,\r\nlight bread; that which is sour, heavy, and not fit to eat untoasted,\r\nshould never be used. Care must be taken also not to scorch the slices,\r\nas once scorched, it is spoiled. Properly made, it is equally crisp\r\nthroughout, and possesses a delicious, nutty flavor.\r\n\r\nIts preparation affords an excellent opportunity for using the left-over\r\nslices of bread, and it may be made when the oven has been heated for\r\nother purposes, as after the baking of bread, or even during the\r\nordinary cooking, with little or no additional heat. If one possesses an\r\nAladdin oven, it can be prepared to perfection.\r\n\r\nZwieback may also be purchased in bulk, all ready for use, at ten cents\r\na pound, from the Sanitarium Food Co., Battle Creek, Mich., and it is\r\nserviceable in so many ways that it should form a staple article of food\r\nin every household.\r\n\r\nFor the preparation of toasts, the zwieback must be first softened with\r\nsome hot liquid, preferably thin cream. Heat the cream (two thirds of a\r\npint of cream will be sufficient for six half slices) nearly to boiling\r\nin some rather shallow dish. Put the slices, two or three at a time, in\r\nit, dipping the cream over them and turning so that both sides will\r\nbecome equally softened. Keep the cream hot, and let the slices remain\r\nuntil softened just enough so that the center can be pierced with a\r\nfork, but not until at all mushy or broken. With two forks or a fork and\r\na spoon, remove each slice from the hot cream, draining as thoroughly as\r\npossible, and pack in a heated dish, and repeat the process until as\r\nmuch zwieback has been softened as desired. Cover the dish, and keep hot\r\nuntil ready to serve. Special care should be taken to drain the slices\r\nas thoroughly as possible, that none of them be wet and mushy. It is\r\nbetter to remove them from the cream when a little hard than to allow\r\nthem to become too soft, as they will soften somewhat by standing after\r\nbeing packed in the dish. Prepare the sauce for the toast at the same\r\ntime or before softening the slices, and pour into a pitcher for\r\nserving. Serve the slices in individual dishes, turning a small quantity\r\nof the hot sauce over each as served.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nAPPLE TOAST.--Fresh, nicely flavored apples stewed in a small\r\nquantity of water, rubbed through, a colander, sweetened, then cooked in\r\na granite-ware dish in a slow oven until quite dry, make a nice dressing\r\nfor toast. Baked sweet or sour apples rubbed through a colander to\r\nremove cores and skins, are also excellent. Soften slices of zwieback in\r\nhot cream, and serve with a spoonful or two on each slice. If desired,\r\nthe apple may be flavored with a little pineapple or lemon, or mixed\r\nwith grape, cranberry, or apricot, thus making a number of different\r\ntoasts.\r\n\r\nAPRICOT TOAST.--Stew some nice dried apricots as directed on page\r\n191. When done, rub through a fine colander to remove all skins and to\r\nrender them homogeneous. Add sugar to sweeten, and serve as a dressing\r\non slices of zwieback which have been previously softened in hot cream.\r\nOne half or two thirds fresh or dried apples may be used with the\r\napricots, if preferred.\r\n\r\nASPARAGUS TOAST.--Prepare asparagus as directed on page 255. When\r\ntender, drain off the liquor and season it with a little cream, and salt\r\nif desired. Moisten nicely browned zwieback in the liquor and lay in a\r\nhot dish; unbind the asparagus, heap it upon the toast, and serve.\r\n\r\nBANANA TOAST.--Peel and press some nice bananas through a colander.\r\nThis may be very easily done with a potato masher, or if preferred a\r\nvegetable press may be used for the purpose. Moisten slices of zwieback\r\nwith hot cream and serve with a large spoonful of the banana pulp on\r\neach slice. Fresh peaches may be prepared and used on the toast in the\r\nsame way.\r\n\r\nBERRY TOAST.--Canned strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries\r\nmay be made into an excellent dressing for toast.\r\n\r\nTurn a can of well-kept berries into a colander over an earthen dish, to\r\nseparate the juice from the berries. Place the juice in a porcelain\r\nkettle and heat to boiling. Thicken to the consistency of cream with\r\nflour rubbed smooth in a little water; a tablespoonful of flour to the\r\npint of juice will be about the right proportion. Add the berries and\r\nboil up just sufficiently to cook the flour and heat the berries; serve\r\nhot. If cream for moistening the zwieback is not obtainable, a little\r\njuice may be reserved without thickening, and heated in another dish to\r\nmoisten the toast; of if preferred, the fruit may be heated and poured\r\nover the dry zwieback without being thickened, or it may be rubbed\r\nthrough a colander as for Apricot Toast.\r\n\r\nBERRY TOAST NO. 2.--Take fresh red or black raspberries,\r\nblueberries, or strawberries, and mash well with a spoon. Add sugar to\r\nsweeten, and serve as a dressing on slices of zwieback previously\r\nmoistened with hot cream.\r\n\r\nCELERY TOAST.--Cut the crisp white portion of celery into inch\r\npieces, simmer twenty minutes or half an hour, or until tender, in a\r\nvery little water; add salt and a cup of rich milk. Heat to boiling, and\r\nthicken with a little flour rubbed smooth in a small quantity of milk--a\r\nteaspoonful of flour to the pint of liquid. Serve hot, poured over\r\nslices of zwieback previously moistened with cream or hot water.\r\n\r\nCREAM TOAST.--For this use good Graham or whole-wheat zwieback. Have\r\na pint of thin sweet cream scalding hot, salt it a little if desired,\r\nand moisten the zwieback in it as previously directed packing it\r\nimmediately into a hot dish; cover tightly so that the toast may steam,\r\nand serve. The slices should be thoroughly moistened, but not soft and\r\nmushy nor swimming in cream; indeed, it is better if a little of the\r\ncrispness still remains.\r\n\r\nCREAM TOAST WITH POACHED EGG.--Prepare the cream toast as\r\npreviously directed, and serve hot with a well-poached egg on each\r\nslice.\r\n\r\nCHERRY TOAST.--Take a quart of ripe cherries; stem, wash and stew\r\n(if preferred the stones may be removed) until tender but not broken;\r\nadd sugar to sweeten, and pour over slices of well-browned dry toast or\r\nzwieback. Serve cold.\r\n\r\nGRAVY TOAST.--Heat a quart and a cupful of rich milk to boiling,\r\nadd salt, and stir into it three scant tablespoonfuls of flour which has\r\nbeen rubbed to a smooth paste in a little cold milk. This quantity will\r\nbe sufficient for about a dozen slices of toast. Moisten slices of\r\nzwieback with hot water and pack in a heated dish. When serving, pour a\r\nquantity of the cream cause over each slice.\r\n\r\nDRY TOAST WITH HOT CREAM.--Nicely prepared zwieback served in hot\r\nsaucers with hot cream poured over each slice at the table, makes a most\r\ndelicious breakfast dish.\r\n\r\nGRAPE TOAST.--Stem well-ripened grapes, wash well, and scald\r\nwithout water in a double boiler until broken; rub through a colander to\r\nremove sends and skins, and when cool, sweeten to taste. If the toast is\r\ndesired for breakfast, the grapes should be prepared the day previous.\r\nSoften the toast in hot cream, as previously directed, and pack in a\r\ntureen. Heat the prepared grapes and serve, pouring a small quantity\r\nover each slice of toast. Canned grapes may be used instead of fresh\r\nones, if desired.\r\n\r\nLENTIL TOAST.--Lentils stewed as directed for Lentil Gravy on page\r\n226 served as a dressing on slices of zwieback moistened with hot cream\r\nor water, makes a very palatable toast. Browned flour may be used to\r\nthicken the dressing if preferred.\r\n\r\nPRUNE TOAST.--Cook prunes as directed on page 191, allowing them to\r\nsimmer very slowly for a long time. When done, rub through a colander,\r\nand if quite thin, they should be stewed again for a time, until they\r\nare about the consistency of marmalade. Moisten slices of zwieback with\r\nhot cream, and serve with a spoonful or two of the prune dressing on\r\neach. One third dried apple may be used with the prune, if preferred.\r\n\r\nPEACH TOAST.--Stew nice fresh peaches in a small quantity of water;\r\nwhen tender, rub through a colander, and if quite juicy, place on the\r\nback of the range where they will cook very slowly until nearly all the\r\nwater has evaporated, and the peach is of the consistency of marmalade.\r\nAdd sugar to sweeten, and serve the same as prunes, on slices of\r\nzwieback previously moistened with hot cream. Canned peaches may be\r\ndrained from their juice and prepared in the same manner. Dried or\r\nevaporated peaches may also be used. Toast with dried-peach dressing\r\nwill be more delicate in flavor if one third dried apples be used with\r\nthe peaches.\r\n\r\nSNOWFLAKE TOAST.--Heat to boiling a quart of milk to which a half\r\ncup of cream, and a little salt have been added. Thicken with a\r\ntablespoonful of flour rubbed smooth in a little cold milk. Have ready\r\nthe whites of two eggs beaten to a stiff froth; and when the sauce is\r\nwell cooked, turn a cupful of it on the beaten egg, stirring well\r\nmeanwhile so that it will form a light, frothy mixture, to which add the\r\nremainder of the sauce. If the sauce is not sufficiently hot to\r\ncoagulate the albumen, it may be heated again almost to the boiling\r\npoint, but should not be allowed to boil. The sauce should be of a\r\nlight, frothy consistency throughout. Serve as dressing on nicely\r\nmoistened slices of zwieback.\r\n\r\nTOMATO TOAST.--Moisten slices of zwieback in hot cream, and serve\r\nwith a dressing prepared by heating a pint of strained stewed tomato to\r\nboiling, and thickening with a tablespoonful of corn starch or flour\r\nrubbed smooth in a little cold water. Season with salt and a half cupful\r\nof hot cream. The cream may be omitted, if preferred.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE OYSTER TOAST.--Cook a quart of cleaned, sliced vegetable\r\noysters in a quart of water until very tender; add a pint and a half of\r\nrich milk, salt to taste, and thicken the whole with two tablespoonfuls\r\nof flour rubbed to a smooth paste with a little milk. Let it boil for a\r\nfew minutes, and serve as a dressing on slices of well-browned toast\r\npreviously moistened with hot water or cream.\r\n\r\n\r\n_MISCELLANEOUS BREAKFAST DISHES._\r\n\r\nBREWIS.--Heat a pint of rich milk to boiling, remove from fire, and\r\nbeat into it thoroughly and quickly a cup of very fine stale rye or\r\nGraham bread crumbs. Serve at once with cream.\r\n\r\nBLACKBERRY MUSH.--Rub a pint of canned or fresh stewed and\r\nsweetened blackberries, having considerable juice, through a fine\r\ncolander or sieve to remove the seeds. Add water to make a pint and a\r\nhalf cupful in all, heat to boiling, and sprinkle into it a cupful of\r\nsifted Graham flour, or sufficient to make a mush of desired thickness.\r\nCook as directed for Graham Mush, page 90. Serve hot with cream.\r\n\r\nDRY GRANOLA.--This prepared food, made from wheat, corn, and oats,\r\nand obtainable from the Sanitarium Food Co., Battle Creek, Mich., forms\r\nan excellent breakfast dish eaten with cold or hot milk and cream.\r\nWheatena, prepared wholly from wheat; Avenola, made from oats and wheat;\r\nand Gofio, made from parched grains, all obtainable from the same firm,\r\nare each delicious and suitable foods for the morning meal.\r\n\r\nFRUMENTY.--Wash well a pint of best wheat, and soak for twenty-four\r\nhours in water just sufficient to cover. Put the soaked wheat in a\r\ncovered earthen baking pot or jar, cover well with water, and let it\r\ncook in a very slow oven for twelve hours. This may be done the day\r\nbefore it is wanted, or if one has a coal range in which a fire may be\r\nkept all night, or an Aladdin oven, the grain may be started in the\r\nevening and cooked at night. When desired for use, put in a saucepan\r\nwith three pints of milk, a cupful of well-washed Zante currants, and\r\none cup of seeded raisins. Boil together for a few minutes, thicken with\r\nfour tablespoonfuls of flour rubbed smooth in a little cold milk, and\r\nserve.\r\n\r\nMACARONI WITH RAISINS.--Break macaroni into inch lengths sufficient\r\nto fill a half-pint cup. Heat four cups of milk, and when actively\r\nboiling, put in the macaroni and cook until tender. Pour boiling water\r\nover a half cup of raisins, and let them stand until swelled. Ten or\r\nfifteen minutes before the macaroni is done, add the raisins. Serve hot\r\nwith or without the addition of cream. Macaroni cooked in the various\r\nways as directed in the chapter on Grains, is also suitable for\r\nbreakfast dishes.\r\n\r\nMACARONI WITH KORNLET.--Break macaroni into inch lengths and cook\r\nin boiling milk and water. Prepare the kornlet by adding to it an equal\r\nquantity of rich milk or thin cream, and thickening with a little flour,\r\na tablespoonful to the pint. When done, drain the macaroni, and add the\r\nkornlet in the proportion of a pint of kornlet mixture to one and one\r\nhalf cups of macaroni. Mix well, turn into an earthen dish, and brown in\r\na moderate oven. Left-over kornlet soup, if kept on ice, may be utilized\r\nfor this breakfast dish, and the macaroni may be cooked the day before.\r\nGreen corn pulp may be used in place of the kornlet.\r\n\r\nPEACH MUSH.--Prepare the same as Blackberry Mush using very thin\r\npeach sauce made smooth by rubbing through a colander. Freshly stewed or\r\ncanned peaches or nicely cooked dried peaches are suitable for this\r\npurpose. Apples and grapes may be likewise used for a breakfast mush.\r\n\r\nRICE WITH LEMON.--Wash a cup of rice and turn it into three pints\r\nof boiling water, let it boil vigorously until tender, and turn into a\r\ncolander to drain. While still in the colander and before the rice has\r\nbecome at all cold, dip quickly in and out of a pan of cold water\r\nseveral times to separate the grains, draining well afterward. All\r\nshould be done so quickly that the rice will not become too cold for\r\nserving; if necessary to reheat, place for a few moments in a dish in a\r\nsteamer over a kettle of boiling water. Serve with a dressing of lemon\r\npreviously prepared by cutting two fresh lemons in thin, wafer-like\r\nslices, sprinkling each thickly with sugar, and allowing them to stand\r\nfor an hour or more until a syrup is formed. When the rice is ready to\r\nserve, lay the slices of lemon on top of it, pouring the syrup over it,\r\nand serve with a slice or two of the lemon for each dish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE TOPICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The lightest breakfast is the best.--_Oswald._\r\n\r\n    A NEW NAME FOR BREAKFAST.--\"Tum, mamma, leth's go down to tupper,\"\r\n    said a little toddler to her mother, one morning, recently.\r\n\r\n    \"Why, we don't have supper in the morning,\" replied the mother.\r\n\r\n    \"Den leth's do down to dinner,\" urged the little one.\r\n\r\n    \"But we don't have dinner in the morning,\" corrected the mother.\r\n\r\n    \"Well, den, leth's do down any way,\" pleaded the child.\r\n\r\n    \"But try and think what meal we have in the morning,\" urged mamma.\r\n\r\n    \"I know,\" said the toddler, brightening up.\r\n\r\n    \"What meal do we have in the morning?\"\r\n\r\n    \"Oatmeal. Tum on; leth's do.\"--_Sel._\r\n\r\n    Seneca, writing to a friend of his frugal fare which he declares\r\n    does not cost a sixpence a day, says:--\r\n\r\n    \"Do you ask if that can supply due nourishment? Yes; and pleasure\r\n    too. Not indeed, that fleeting and superficial pleasure which needs\r\n    to be perpetually recruited, but a solid and substantial one. Bread\r\n    and polenta certainly is not a luxurious feeding, but it is no\r\n    little advantage to be able to receive pleasure from a simple diet\r\n    of which no change of fortune can deprive one.\"\r\n\r\n     Breakfast: Come to breakfast!\r\n     Little ones and all,--\r\n     How their merry footsteps\r\n     Patter at the call!\r\n     Break the bread; pour freely\r\n     Milk that cream-like flows;\r\n     A blessing on their appetites\r\n     And on their lips of rose.\r\n\r\n     Dinner may be pleasant\r\n     So may the social tea,\r\n     But yet, methinks the breakfast\r\n     Is best of all the three.\r\n     With its greeting smile of welcome,\r\n     Its holy voice of prayer,\r\n     It forgeth heavenly armor\r\n     To foil the hosts of care.\r\n\r\n    --_Mrs. Sigourney._\r\n\r\n    Health is not quoted in the markets because it is without\r\n    price.--_Sel._\r\n\r\n    It is a mistake to think that the more a man eats, the fatter and\r\n    stronger he will become.--_Sel._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESSERTS\r\n\r\nCustom has so long established the usage of finishing the dinner with a\r\ndessert of some kind, that a _menu_ is considered quite incomplete\r\nwithout it; and we shall devote the next few pages to articles which may\r\nbe deemed appropriate and healthful desserts, not because we consider\r\nthe dessert itself of paramount importance, for indeed we do not think\r\nit essential to life or even to good living, but because we hope the\r\nhints and suggestions which our space permits, may aid the housewife in\r\npreparing more wholesome, inexpensive dishes in lieu of the indigestible\r\narticles almost universally used for this purpose.\r\n\r\nWe see no objection to the use of a dessert, if the articles offered are\r\nwholesome, and are presented before an abundance has already been taken.\r\nAs usually served, the dessert is but a \"snare and delusion\" to the\r\ndigestive organs. Compounded of substances \"rich,\" not in food elements,\r\nbut in fats, sweets, and spices, and served after enough has already\r\nbeen eaten, it offers a great temptation to overeat; while the elements\r\nof which it is largely composed, serve to hamper the digestive organs,\r\nto clog the liver, and to work mischief generally. At the same time it\r\nmay be remarked that the preparation of even wholesome desserts requires\r\nan outlay of time and strength better by far expended in some other\r\nmanner. Desserts are quite unnecessary to a good, healthful, nutritious\r\ndietary. The simplest of all desserts are the various nuts and delicious\r\nfruits with which nature has so abundantly supplied us, at no greater\r\ncost than their harmful substitutes, and which require no expenditure of\r\ntime or strength in their preparation. If, however, other forms of\r\ndessert are desired, a large variety may be prepared in a simple manner,\r\nso as to be both pleasing and appetizing.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL SUGGESTIONS.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of desserts, as in that of all other foods it is\r\nessential that all material used shall be thoroughly good of its kind.\r\nIf bread is to be used, the crumbs should be dry and rather stale, but\r\non no account use that which is sour or moldy. Some housekeepers imagine\r\nthat if their bread happens to spoil and become sour, although it is\r\nhardly palatable enough for the table, it may be advantageously used to\r\nmake puddings. It is indeed quite possible to combine sour bread with\r\nother ingredients so as to make a pudding agreeable to the palate; but\r\ndisguising sour bread makes sweets and flavors by no means changes it\r\ninto a wholesome food. It is better economy to throw sour bread away at\r\nonce than to impose it upon the digestive organs at the risk of health\r\nand strength.\r\n\r\nBread which has begun to show appearance of mold should never be used;\r\nfor mold is a poison, and very serious illness has resulted from the\r\neating of puddings made from moldy bread.\r\n\r\nEggs, to be used for desserts, should always be fresh and good. Cooks\r\noften imagine that an egg too stale to be eaten in any other way will do\r\nvery well for use in cakes and puddings, because it can be disguised so\r\nas not to be apparent to the taste; but stale eggs are unfit for food,\r\neither alone or in combination with other ingredients. Their use is\r\noften the occasion of serious disturbances of the digestive organs. Most\r\ndesserts in which eggs are used will be much lighter if the yolks and\r\nwhites are beaten separately. If in winter, and eggs are scarce, fewer\r\nmay be used, and two tablespoonfuls of dry snow for each omitted egg\r\nstirred in the last thing before baking.\r\n\r\nMilk, likewise, should always be sweet and fresh. If it is to be heated,\r\nuse a double boiler, so that there will be no danger of scorching. If\r\nfresh milk is not available, the condensed milk found at the grocer's is\r\nan excellent substitute. Dissolve according to directions, and follow\r\nthe recipe the same as with fresh milk, omitting one half or two thirds\r\nthe given amount of sugar.\r\n\r\nIf dried sweet fruits, raisins, or currants are to be used, look them\r\nover carefully, put them in a colander, and placing it in a pan of warm\r\nwater, allow the currants to remain until plump. This will loosen the\r\ndirt which, while they are shriveled, sticks in the creases, and they\r\nmay then be washed by dipping the colander in and out of clean water\r\nuntil they are free from sediment; rinse in two waters, then spread upon\r\na cloth, and let them get perfectly dry before using.\r\n\r\nIt is a good plan, after purchasing raisins and currants, to wash and\r\ndry a quantity, and store in glass cans ready for use. To facilitate the\r\nstoning of raisins, put them into a colander placed in a dish of warm\r\nwater until plump; then drain, when the seeds can be easily removed.\r\n\r\nFor desserts which are to be molded, always wet the molds in cold water\r\nbefore pouring in the desserts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_SUGGESTIONS FOR FLAVORING, ETC._\r\n\r\nTO PREPARE ALMOND PASTE.--Blanch the nuts according to directions\r\ngiven on page 215. Allow them to dry thoroughly, and pound in a mortar\r\nto a smooth paste. They can be reduced much easier if dried for a day or\r\ntwo after blanching. During the pounding, sprinkle with a few drops of\r\ncold water, white of egg, rose water, or lemon juice, to prevent them\r\nfrom oiling.\r\n\r\nCOCOANUT FLAVOR.--Cocoanut, freshly grated or desiccated, unless in\r\nextremely fine particles, is a very indigestible substance, and when its\r\nflavor is desired for custards, puddings, etc., it is always better to\r\nsteep a few tablespoonfuls in a pint of milk for twenty minutes or a\r\nhalf hour, and strain out the particles. The milk should not be allowed\r\nto boil, as it will be likely to curdle. One tablespoonful of freshly\r\ngrated cocoanut or two of the desiccated will give a very pleasant and\r\ndelicate flavor; and if a more intense flavor is desired, use a larger\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\nORANGE AND LEMON FLAVOR.--Orange or lemon flavor may be obtained by\r\nsteeping a few strips of the yellow part of the rind of lemon or orange\r\nin milk for twenty minutes. Skim out the rind before using for desserts.\r\nCare should be taken to use only the yellow part, as the white will\r\nimpart a bitter flavor. The grated rind may also be used for flavoring,\r\nbut in grating the peel, one must be careful to grate very lightly, and\r\nthus use only the outer yellow portion, which contains the essential oil\r\nof the fruit. Grate evenly, turning and working around the lemon, using\r\nas small a surface of the grater as possible, in order to prevent waste.\r\nGenerally, twice across the grater and back will be sufficient for\r\nremoving all the yellow skin from one portion of a lemon. A well-grated\r\nlemon should be of exactly the same shape as before, with no yellow skin\r\nremaining, and no deep scores into the white. Remove the yellow pulp\r\nfrom the grater with a fork.\r\n\r\nTO COLOR SUGAR.--For ornamenting the meringues of puddings and\r\nother desserts, take a little of the fresh juice of cranberries, red\r\nraspberries, currants, black raspberries, grapes, or other colored\r\njuices of fruits, thicken it stiff with the sugar, spread on a plate to\r\ndry, or use at one. It may be colored yellow with orange peel strained\r\nthrough a cloth, or green with the juice of spinach. Sugar prepared in\r\nthis manner is quite as pretty and much more wholesome than the colored\r\nsugars found in market, which are often prepared with poisonous\r\nchemicals.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUIT DESSERTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nAPPLE DESSERT.--Pare some large tart apples, remove the cores, put\r\ninto the cavities a little quince jelly, lemon flavored sugar, or grated\r\npineapple and sugar, according to the flavor desired. Have as many\r\nsquares of bread with the crust taken off as there are apples, and place\r\na filled apple on each piece of bread, on earthen pie plates; moisten\r\nwell with a little quince jelly dissolved in water, lemon juice, or\r\npineapple juice, according to the filling used. Cover closely, and bake\r\nin a rather quick oven till the apples are tender. Serve with whipped\r\ncream and sugar.\r\n\r\nAPPLE MERINGUE DESSERT.--Pare and core enough tart, easy-cooking\r\napples to make a quart when stewed. Cover closely and cook slowly till\r\nperfectly tender, when they should be quite dry. Mash through a\r\ncolander, add a little sugar and a little grated pineapple or lemon\r\npeel. Beat light with a silver fork, turn into a pudding dish, and brown\r\nin a moderate oven ten or fifteen minutes. Then cover with a meringue\r\nmade with two tablespoonfuls of sugar and the beaten whites of two eggs,\r\nand return to the oven for a moment to brown. Serve cold.\r\n\r\nAPPLE ROSE CREAM.--Wash, core, slice, and cook without paring, a\r\ndozen fresh snow apples until very dry. When done, rub through a\r\ncolander to remove the skins, add sugar to sweeten, and the whites of\r\ntwo eggs; beat vigorously with an egg beater until stiff, add a\r\nteaspoonful of rose water for flavoring, and serve at once, or keep on\r\nice. It is especially important that the apples be very dry, otherwise\r\nthe cream will not be light. If after rubbing through the colander,\r\nthere is still much juice, they should be cooked again until it has\r\nevaporated; or they may be turned into a jelly bag and drained. Other\r\nvarieties of apple may be used, and flavored with pineapple or vanilla.\r\nMade as directed of snow apples or others with white flesh and red\r\nskins, the cream should be of a delicate pink color, making a very\r\ndainty as well as delicious dessert.\r\n\r\nAPPLE SNOW.--Pare and quarter some nice tart apples. Those that\r\nwhen cooked will be whitest in color are best. Put them into a china\r\ndish, and steam until tender over a kettle of boiling water. When done,\r\nrub through a colander or beat with a fork until smooth, add sugar to\r\nsweeten and a little grated lemon rind, and beat again. For every cup\r\nand a half of the prepared apple allow the white of one egg, which beat\r\nto a stiff froth, adding the apple to it a little at a time, beating all\r\ntogether until, when taken up in a spoon, it stands quite stiff. Serve\r\ncold, with or without a simple custard prepared with a pint of hot milk,\r\na tablespoonful of sugar, and the yolks of two eggs.\r\n\r\nBAKED APPLES WITH CREAM.--Pare some nice juicy sweet apples, and\r\nremove the cores without dividing. Bake until tender in a covered dish\r\nwith a spoonful or two of water on the bottom. Serve with whipped cream.\r\nOr, bake the apples without paring and when done, remove the skins, and\r\nserve in the same manner. The cream may be flavored with a little lemon\r\nor rose if desired. Lemon apples and Citron apples, prepared as directed\r\non pages 186 and 187, make a most delicious dessert served with whipped\r\ncream and sugar, or with mock cream flavored with cocoanut.\r\n\r\nBAKED SWEET APPLE DESSERT.--Wash and remove the cores from a dozen\r\nmedium-sized sweet apples, and one third as many sour ones, and bake\r\nuntil well done. Mash through a colander to make smooth and remove the\r\nskins. Put into a granite-ware dish, smooth the top with a knife, return\r\nto the oven and bake very slowly until dry enough to keep its shape when\r\ncut. Add if desired a meringue made by heating the white of one egg with\r\na tablespoonful of sugar. Cut into squares, and serve in individual\r\ndishes. The meringue may be flavored with lemon or dotted with bits of\r\ncolored sugar.\r\n\r\nBANANAS IN SYRUP.--Heat in a porcelain kettle a pint of currant and\r\nred raspberry juice, equal parts, sweetened to taste. When boiling, drop\r\ninto it a dozen peeled bananas, and simmer very gently for twenty\r\nminutes. Remove the bananas, boil the juice until thickened to the\r\nconsistency of syrup, and pour over the fruit. Serve cold.\r\n\r\nBAKED BANANAS.--Bake fresh, firm, yelow bananas with the skins on\r\nfifteen minutes in a moderate oven. Serve hot.\r\n\r\nFRESH FRUIT COMPOTE.--Flavor three tablespoonfuls of sugar by\r\nmixing with it a little of the grated yellow rind of an orange, or by\r\nrubbing it over the orange to extract the oil. If the latter method is\r\nused, the square lump sugar will be preferable. Pare, quarter, and slice\r\nthree medium-sized tart apples. Peel, remove the seeds, and cut in quite\r\nfine pieces three oranges. Put the fruit in alternate layers in a glass\r\ndish. Sweeten a cupful of fresh or canned raspberry juice with the\r\nflavored sugar, and turn it over the fruit. Put the dish on ice to cool\r\nfor a half hour before serving.\r\n\r\nGRAPE APPLES.--Sweeten a pint of fresh grape juice with a pint of\r\nsugar, and simmer gently until reduced one third. Pare and core without\r\ndividing, six or eight nice tart apples, and stew very slowly in the\r\ngrape juice until tender, but not broken. Remove the apples and boil the\r\njuice (if any remain) until thickened to the consistency of syrup. Serve\r\ncold with a dressing of whipped cream. Canned grape pulp or juice may be\r\nutilized for this purpose. Sweet apples may be used instead of tart\r\nones, and the sugar omitted.\r\n\r\nPEACH CREAM.--Pare and stone some nice yellow peaches, and mash\r\nwith a spoon or press through a colander with a potato masher. Allow\r\nequal quantities of the peach pulp and cream, add a little sugar to\r\nsweeten, and beat all together until the cream is light. Serve in\r\nsaucers or glasses with currant buns. A banana cream may be prepared in\r\nthe same manner.\r\n\r\nPRUNE DESSERT.--Prepare some prune marmalade as directed on page\r\n191. Put in a square granite-ware dish, which place inside another dish\r\ncontaining hot water, and cook it in a slow oven until the marmalade is\r\ndry enough to retain its shape when cut with a knife. If desired add a\r\nmeringue as for baked sweet apple dessert, dotting the top with pink\r\nsugar. Serve in squares in individual dishes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESSERTS MADE OF FRUIT WITH GRAINS, BREAD, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nAPPLE SANDWICH.--Mix half a cup of sugar with the grated yellow\r\nrind of half a lemon. Stir half a cup of cream into a quart of soft\r\nbread crumbs; prepare three pints of sliced apples, sprinkled with the\r\nsugar; fill a pudding dish with alternate layers of moistened crumbs and\r\nsliced apples, finishing with a thick layer of crumbs. Unless the apples\r\nare very juicy, add half a cup of cold water, and unless quite tart,\r\nhave mixed with the water the juice of half a lemon. Cover and bake\r\nabout one hour. Remove the cover toward the last, that the top may brown\r\nlightly. Serve with cream. Berries or other acid fruits may be used in\r\nplace of apples, and rice or cracked wheat mush substituted for bread\r\ncrumbs.\r\n\r\nAPPLE SANDWICH NO. 2.--Prepare and stew some apples as for sauce,\r\nallowing them to become quite dry; flavor with lemon, pineapples,\r\nquince, or any desired flavor. Moisten slices of zwieback in hot cream\r\nas for toast. Spread a slice with the apple mixture, cover with a second\r\nslice of the moistened zwieback, then cut in squares and serve, with or\r\nwithout a dressing of mock cream. If desired to have the sandwiches\r\nparticularly dainty, cut the bread from which the zwieback is prepared\r\nin rounds, triangles, or stars before toasting.\r\n\r\nBAKED APPLE PUDDING.--Pour boiling water over bread crumbs; when\r\nsoft, squeeze out all the water, and line the bottom and sides of an\r\noiled earthen pudding dish with the crumbs. Fill the interior with\r\nsliced apples, and cover with a layer of bread crumbs. Bake in a covered\r\ndish set in a pan of hot water, until the apples are tender; then remove\r\nthe cover and brown. Loosen the pudding with a knife, invert on a plate,\r\nand it will turn out whole. Serve with sugar and cream.\r\n\r\nBARLEY FRUIT PUDDING.--Mix together a pint of cold, well steamed\r\npearl barley, a cup of finely minced tart apples, three fourths of a cup\r\nof chopped and seeded raisins, a third of a cup of sugar, and a cup of\r\nboiling water and turn into a pudding dish; cover, and place the dish in\r\nthe oven in a pan of hot water, and bake slowly an hour and a half, or\r\nuntil the water has become quite absorbed and the fruit tender. Serve\r\nwarm with a water, adding sugar to taste, and thickening with a half\r\nteaspoonful of cornstarch. Any tart fruit jelly may be used, or the\r\npudding may be served with cream and sugar flavored with a little grated\r\nlemon rind.\r\n\r\nBARLEY FIG PUDDING.--One pint of well-steamed pearl barley, two\r\ncups of finely chopped best figs, one half cup of sugar, one half cup of\r\nthin sweet cream, and one and one half cups of fresh milk. Mix all\r\nthoroughly, turn into an earthen pudding dish; place it in the oven in\r\na pan half full of hot water, and bake slowly till the milk is nearly\r\nabsorbed. The pudding should be stirred once or twice during the baking,\r\nso that the figs will be distributed evenly, instead of rising to the\r\ntop.\r\n\r\nBLACKBERRY CORNSTARCH PUDDING.--Take two quarts of well-ripened\r\nblackberries which have been carefully looked over, put them into a\r\ngranite-ware boiler with half a cup of water, and stew for twenty\r\nminutes. Add sugar to sweeten, and three heaping tablespoonfuls of\r\ncornstarch rubbed to a cream with a little cold water. Cook until\r\nthickened, pour into molds, and cool. Serve cold with milk or cream.\r\nOther fresh or canned berries may be used in the same way.\r\n\r\nCOCOANUT AND CORNSTARCH BLANCMANGE.--Simmer two tablespoonfuls of\r\ndesiccated cocoanut in a pint of milk for twenty minutes, and strain\r\nthrough a fine sieve. If necessary, add more cold milk to make a full\r\npint. Add a tablespoonful of sugar, heat to boiling, and stir in\r\ngradually two tablespoonfuls of cornstarch rubbed smooth in a very\r\nlittle cold milk. Cook five minutes, turn into cups, and serve cold with\r\nfruit sauce or cream.\r\n\r\nCORNSTARCH BLANCMANGE.--Stir together two tablespoonfuls of\r\ncornstarch, half a cup of sugar, the juice and a little of the grated\r\nrind of one lemon; braid the whole with cold water enough to dissolve\r\nwell. Then pour boiling water over the mixture, stirring meanwhile,\r\nuntil it becomes transparent. Allow it to bubble a few minutes longer,\r\npour into molds, and serve cold with cream and sugar.\r\n\r\nCORNSTARCH WITH RAISINS.--Measure out one pint of rich milk. Rub\r\ntwo tablespoonfuls of cornstarch perfectly smooth with a little of the\r\nmilk, and heat the remainder to boiling, adding to it a tablespoonful of\r\nsugar. Add the braided cornstarch, and let it cook until it thickens,\r\nstirring constantly. Then add a half cup of raisins which have been\r\npreviously steamed. This may be served hot with sugar and cream, or\r\nturned into cups and molded, and served cold with lemon, orange, or\r\nother fruit sauce for dressing.\r\n\r\nCORNSTARCH WITH APPLES.--Prepare the cornstarch as in the preceding\r\nrecipe, omitting the raisins. Place in a pudding dish some lemon apple\r\nsauce, without juice, about two inches deep. Pour the cornstarch over\r\nit, and serve hot or cold with cream.\r\n\r\nCORNSTARCH FRUIT MOLD.--Heat a quart of strawberry, raspberry, or\r\ncurrant juice, sweetened to taste, to boiling. If the pure juice of\r\nberries is used, it may be diluted with one cup of water to each pint\r\nand a half of juice. Stir in four tablespoonfuls of cornstarch well\r\nbraided with a little of the juice reserved for this purpose. Boil until\r\nthe starch is well cooked, stirring constantly. Pour into molds\r\npreviously wet with cold water, and cool. Serve with cream and sugar. A\r\ncircle of fresh berries around the mold when served adds to its\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nCORNSTARCH FRUIT MOLD NO. 2.--Wash, stone, and stew some nice\r\nFrench prunes, add sugar to sweeten, and if there is not an abundance of\r\njuice, a little boiling water. For every one fourth pound of prunes\r\nthere should be enough juice to make a pint in all, for which add two\r\ntablespoonfuls of cornstarch, rubbed smooth in a little cold water, and\r\nboil three or four minutes. Pour into cups previously wet in cold water,\r\nand mold. Serve cold with whipped cream. Other dried or canned fruits,\r\nas apricots, peaches, cherries, etc., may be used in place of prunes, if\r\npreferred.\r\n\r\nCRACKED-WHEAT PUDDING.--A very simple pudding may be made with two\r\ncups of cold, well-cooked cracked wheat, two and a half cups of milk,\r\nand one half cup of sugar. Let the wheat soak in the milk till\r\nthoroughly mixed and free from lumps, then add the sugar and a little\r\ngrated lemon peel, and bake about three fourths of an hour in a moderate\r\noven. It should be of a creamy consistency when cold, but will appear\r\nquite thin when taken from the oven. By flavoring the milk with\r\ncocoanut, a different pudding may be produced. Rolled or pearl wheat may\r\nbe used for this pudding. A cupful of raisins may be added if desired.\r\n\r\nCRACKED-WHEAT PUDDING NO. 2.--Four and one half cups of milk, a\r\nvery scant half cup of cracked wheat, one half cup of sugar; put\r\ntogether in a pudding dish, and bake slowly with the dish covered and\r\nset in a pan of hot water for three or four hours, or until the wheat is\r\nperfectly tender, as may be ascertained by dipping a few grains with a\r\nspoon out from the side of the dish.\r\n\r\nFARINA BLANCMANGE.--Heat a quart of milk, reserving one half cup,\r\nto boiling. Then add two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and four heaping\r\ntablespoonfuls of farina, previously moistened with the reserved half\r\ncup of milk. Let all boil rapidly for a few minutes till the farina has\r\nwell set, then place in a double boiler, or a dish set in a pan of\r\nboiling water, to cook an hour longer. Mold in cups previously wet with\r\ncold water. Serve with sugar and cream flavored with vanilla or a little\r\ngrated lemon rind, mock cream, or cocoanut sauce.\r\n\r\nMuch variety may be given this simple dessert by serving it with a\r\ndressing of fruit juices; red raspberry, strawberry, grape, current,\r\ncranberry, cherry, and plum are all very good. If desired, the milk with\r\nwhich the blancmange is prepared may be first flavored with cocoanut,\r\nthus making a different blancmange. Fresh fruit, as sliced banana,\r\nblueberries, or strawberries, lightly stirred in just before molding,\r\nmake other excellent varieties.\r\n\r\nFARINA FRUIT MOLD.--Put a quart of well-sweetened red raspberry\r\njuice into the inner cup of a double boiler. Heat to boiling, and stir\r\nin four heaping tablespoonfuls of farina first moistened with a little\r\nof the juice. Boil up until thickened, then set into the outer boiler,\r\nthe water in which should be boiling, and cook for one hour. Pour into\r\nmolds previously wet in cold water, and cool. Serve with whipped cream\r\nor mock cream. Currant, strawberry, cherry, or blackberry juice may be\r\nused instead of raspberry. If water be added to dilute the juice, a\r\nlittle more farina will be needed.\r\n\r\nFRUIT PUDDING.--Measure out one quart of rich new milk, reserving\r\nhalf a pint to wet five large rounded tablespoonfuls of sifted flour.\r\nAdd to the milk one even cup of sugar, turn in the flour mixture and\r\nheat to boiling in a farina kettle, stirring all the while to prevent\r\nlumps, and cook till it thickens, which will be about ten minutes after\r\nit begins to boil. Remove from the stove, and beat while it is cooling.\r\nWhen cool, add sliced bananas or whole strawberries, whortleberries,\r\nraspberries, blackberries, sliced apricots, or peaches. Serve cold.\r\n\r\nJAM PUDDING.--Make a jam by mashing well some fresh raspberries or\r\nblueberries and sweetening to taste. Spread over slices of fresh, light\r\nbread or buns, and pile in layers one above another in a pudding dish.\r\nPour over the layers enough rich milk or thin cream heated to scalding,\r\nto moisten the whole. Turn a plate over the pudding, place a weight upon\r\nit, and press lightly till cold. Cut in slices, and serve with or\r\nwithout a cream dressing.\r\n\r\nPLAIN FRUIT PUDDING OR BROWN BETTY.--Chop together one part seeded\r\nraisins and two parts good tart apples. Fill a pudding dish with\r\nalternate layers of the fruit and bread crumbs, finishing with the bread\r\ncrumbs on top. Unless the apples are very juicy, moisten the whole with\r\na tablespoonful of lemon juice in a cup of cold water, for a pudding\r\nfilling a three-pint dish. Cover the dish and place it in a moderate\r\noven in a pan of hot water, and bake nearly an hour; then remove from\r\nthe pan, uncover, and brown nicely. Serve warm with cream and sugar, or\r\nwith an orange or lemon sauce. Seeded cherries may be used in place of\r\nthe apples and raisins. In that case, each layer of fruit should be\r\nsprinkled lightly with sugar, and the water omitted.\r\n\r\nPRUNE PUDDING.--Moisten rather thin slices of stale bread in hot\r\nmilk and place in a pudding dish with alternate layers of stewed prunes\r\nfrom which the stones have been removed, finishing with bread on top.\r\nPour over the whole a little more hot milk or pure juice or both, and\r\nbake in a moderate over three fourths of an hour. Serve hot or cold with\r\norange or lemon sauce.\r\n\r\nRICE MERINGUE.--Steam a cupful of rice as directed on page 99 until\r\ntender and dry. Heap it loosely on a glass dish, and dot with squares of\r\ncranberry or currant jelly. Beat with the whites of two eggs to a stiff\r\nfroth with one third cup of sugar, and pile it roughly over the rice.\r\nServe with cream.\r\n\r\nRICE SNOWBALL.--Wash a cupful of good rice and steam until half\r\ndone. Have pared and cored without dividing, six large, easy cooking\r\ntart apples. Put a clean square of cheese cloth over a plate, place the\r\napples on it, and fill them and all the interstices between with rice.\r\nPut the remainder of the rice over and around the apples; tie up the\r\ncloth, and cook in a kettle of boiling water until the apples are\r\ntender. When done, lift from the water and drain well, untie the cloth,\r\ninvert the pudding upon a plate and remove the cloth. Serve hot with\r\ncream and sugar or cocoanut sauce.\r\n\r\nRICE FRUIT DESSERT.--Cold boiled rice, molded so that it can be\r\nsliced, may be utilized in making a variety of delicious desserts. A\r\nnice pudding may be prepared by filling a dish with alternate layers of\r\nhalf-inch slices of molded rice and grated tart raw apples the same\r\nthickness. Grate a little lemon rind over each layer. Cover, and place\r\nin the oven in a pan of boiling water, and bake for an hour. Serve with\r\nsugar and cream. Stoned cherries or peaches may be used instead of the\r\napple.\r\n\r\nRICE DUMPLING.--Steam a teacup of rice until tender, and line an\r\noiled earthen pudding dish, pressing it up around the sides and over the\r\nbottom. Fill the crust thus made with rather tart apples cut in small\r\nslices; cover with rice, and steam until the apples are tender, which\r\nmay be determined by running a broom-straw through them. Let stand until\r\ncold, then turn from the dish, and serve with sugar and cream. Any easy\r\ncooking tart fruit, as stoned cherries, gooseberries, etc., may be used\r\nin place of the apples when preferred.\r\n\r\nRICE CREAM PUDDING.--Take one cup of good well-washed rice, one\r\nscant cup of sugar, and eight cups of new milk, with a little grated\r\nlemon rind for flavoring. Put all into an earthen pudding dish, and\r\nplace on the top of the range. Heat very slowly until the milk is\r\nboiling, stirring frequently, so that the rice shall not adhere to the\r\nbottom of the dish. Then put into a moderately hot oven, and bake\r\nwithout stirring, till the rice is perfectly tender, which can be\r\nascertained by dipping a spoon in one side and taking out a few grains.\r\nIt should be, when cold, of a rich, creamy consistency, with each grain\r\nof rice whole. Serve cold. It is best if made the day before it is\r\nneeded. If preferred, the milk may be first flavored with cocoanut,\r\naccording to the directions given on page 298.\r\n\r\nRICE PUDDING WITH RAISINS.--Wash thoroughly one half cup of rice,\r\nand soak for two hours in warm water. Drain off the water, add two\r\ntablespoonfuls of sugar, one half cup of raisins, and four cups of milk.\r\nPut in an earthen pudding dish and cook for two hours in a moderate\r\noven, stirring once or twice before the rice begins to swell, then add a\r\ncup of hot milk, and cook for an hour longer.\r\n\r\nRED RICE MOLD.--Take one and one half pints of red currants and\r\none half pint of red raspberries, and follow directions on page 209 for\r\nextracting their juice. The juice may be diluted with one part water to\r\ntwo of juice if desired. Sweeten to taste, and for each pint when\r\nboiling stir in two tablespoonfuls of ground rice or rice flour rubbed\r\nsmooth in a little of the juice which may be retained for the purpose.\r\nPour into molds, cool, and serve with whipped cream.\r\n\r\nRICE AND FRUIT DESSERT.--Steam a cup of good well-washed rice in\r\nmilk till tender. Prepare some tart apples by paring, dividing midway\r\nbetween the stem and blow ends, and removing the cores. Fill the\r\ncavities with quince or pineapple jelly; put the apples in a shallow\r\nstewpan with a half cup of water, cover, and steam till nearly tender.\r\nPut the rice, which should be very moist, around the bottom and sides of\r\na pudding dish; place the apples inside, cover, and bake ten minutes.\r\nServe with cream flavored with quince or lemon.\r\n\r\nRICE AND TAPIOCA PUDDING.--Soak one half cup of tapioca over night\r\nin a cup of water; in the morning drain off the water if any remains.\r\nAdd to the tapioca half a cup of rice, one cup of sugar, one cup of\r\nraisins, and eight cups of new milk, with a little grated lemon rind for\r\nflavoring. Put all in an earthen pudding dish on the top of the range,\r\nwhere it will heat very gradually to the boiling point, stirring\r\nfrequently. When the milk boils, put the pudding in the oven, and bake\r\ntill the rice grains are perfectly tender but not broken and mushy. From\r\ntwenty minutes to half an hour is usually sufficient. When taken from\r\nthe oven, it will appear quite thin, but after cooling will be of a\r\ndelicious, creamy consistency. Serve cold.\r\n\r\nRICE-FLOUR MOLD.--Braid two tablespoonfuls of rice flour with a\r\nlittle milk and stir the mixture into a pint of boiling milk to which\r\nhas been added three tablespoonfuls of sugar, and a little salt if\r\ndesired. Let this boil until it thickens, then mold, and serve with\r\ncream and sugar or with lemon, orange, or other fruit sauce.\r\n\r\nRICE AND STEWED APPLE DESSERT.--Steam or bake some rice in milk\r\nuntil tender, sweeten slightly and spread a layer of the rice half an\r\ninch thick on the bottom of a pudding dish, then a layer of\r\nlemon-flavored apple sauce, which has been rubbed through a colander and\r\nafterward simmered on the range until stiff. If preferred, the sauce may\r\nbe prepared by first baking the apples, and then rubbing the pulp\r\nthrough a colander. Add another layer of rice, then one of sauce, and so\r\non until the dish is full. Bake in a moderate oven and serve hot. If the\r\napples are not very tart, part stewed and sifted cranberries may be used\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nRICE AND STRAWBERRY DESSERT.--Soak a cup of rice in one and a half\r\ncups of new milk; place all in an earthen dish, and steam an hour, or\r\nuntil dry and tender, stirring occasionally for the first fifteen\r\nminutes. When the rice is done, place in the bottom of cups previously\r\nmoistened with cold water, five nice hulled strawberries in the shape of\r\na star. Carefully fill the interstices between the berries with the\r\ncooked rice, and put in a layer of rice. Add next a layer of\r\nstrawberries, then another of rice. Press firmly into the cups, and set\r\naway to cool. When well molded, turn into saucers, and pile whipped\r\ncream around each mold; sprinkle with sugar and serve.\r\n\r\nA little care in forming the stars and filling the molds makes this a\r\ndelicious and pretty dessert. If preferred, the dessert may be prepared\r\nin one large mold, and a larger number of berries arranged in the form\r\nof a cross in the bottom of the dish, covering with rice, and adding as\r\nmany alternate layers of berries and rice as desired.\r\n\r\nSTEWED FRUIT PUDDING.--Take a deep, square or oblong granite-ware\r\nor earthen dish; cut strips of stale bread uniformly an inch in width\r\nand three fourths of an inch in thickness, and place them in the mold\r\nwith spaces between them equal to their width. Or, fit the strips around\r\nthe bottom of a round, earthen pudding dish, like the spokes of a wheel,\r\nwith stewed or canned fruit, sweetened to taste; whortleberries are\r\nbest, but apricots, cherries, currants, strawberries, and gooseberries\r\nmay all be used. Separate the juice from the berries by turning them\r\ninto a colander. Fill the interstices between the bread with hot fruit,\r\nusing just as little juice as possible. Cover with another layer, this\r\ntime placing the strips of bread over the fruit in the first layer, and\r\nleaving the spaces for fruit over the bread in the first layer. Fill the\r\ndish with these layers of fruit and bread, and when full, pour over all\r\nthe hot fruit juice. Put a plate with a weight on it on the top to press\r\nit firmly. Dip off any juice that may be pressed out, and set the\r\npudding in the refrigerator to cool and press. When cold, it will turn\r\nout whole, and can be cut in slices and served with whipped cream or\r\ncocoanut sauce.\r\n\r\nSTRAWBERRY MINUTE PUDDING.--Cook a quart of ripe strawberries in a\r\npint of water till well scalded. Add sugar to taste. Skim out the fruit,\r\nand into the boiling juice stir a scant cup of granulated wheat flour\r\npreviously rubbed to a paste with a little cold water; cook fifteen or\r\ntwenty minutes, pour over the fruit, and serve cold with cream sauce.\r\n\r\nSWEET APPLE PUDDING.--Pare, core, and slice enough ripe, juicy\r\nsweet apples to fill a pint bowl. Heat a quart of new milk to scalding\r\nin a double boiler. Pour it hot over one cup of good granulated\r\ncornmeal, and beat very thoroughly to remove all lumps. Return to the\r\ndouble boiler, and cook until the meal is set. The batter then should\r\nbe about the consistency of corn mush. Remove from the fire, add a pint\r\nof cold milk, stir in the sliced apples, one third of a cup of sugar or\r\nmolasses, and a teaspoonful of flour rubbed smooth in a very little\r\nmilk. Turn all into a deep earthen crock or pudding dish, and bake\r\nslowly from three to four hours, stirring frequently the first hour. It\r\nshould be moderately browned on top when done. Serve warm or cold.\r\n\r\nWHORTLEBERRY PUDDING.--One quart of new milk, one quart of fine\r\nbread crumbs, two quarts of fresh whortleberries, one or two\r\ntablespoonfuls of sugar. Heat the milk to boiling; fill a pudding dish\r\nwith alternate layers of bread crumbs and berries, beginning and ending\r\nwith crumbs. Add the sugar to the milk, let it dissolve, and pour the\r\nwhole over the pudding. Cover closely, and bake in a slow oven within a\r\npan of hot water nearly an hour. Serve warm with cream or cocoanut\r\nsauce.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESSERTS WITH TAPIOCA, SAGO, MONICA, AND SEA MOSS.\r\n\r\nBoth pearl and flake tapioca are suitable for these desserts. They\r\nshould be soaked for some hours before using, and it is always best to\r\nsoak over night if convenient. The flake tapioca requires longer soaking\r\nand cooking than the pearl tapioca. For soaking, use one and a half cups\r\nof water for each cup of flake tapioca, and one pint of water for a cup\r\nof pearl tapioca. For cooking, three or four additional cups of water\r\nwill be required for each cup of tapioca, depending upon, the articles\r\nused with it. A double boiler should be used for the cooking.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nAPPLE TAPIOCA.--Soak a cupful of pearl tapioca over night. In the\r\nmorning simmer in a quart of boiling water until transparent and\r\nthickened. Arrange in the bottom of a pudding dish four or five\r\ngood-sized tart apples, which have been pared, cored, and the cavities\r\nfilled with sugar. Squeeze the juice of a lemon and grate a very little\r\nof the rind over the apples. Pour the tapioca over the fruit. Set the\r\ndish inside a pan filled with hot water, cover, and bake one hour, or\r\nuntil the apples are done. Serve with sugar and cream. It is best nearly\r\ncold. Fresh peaches, pared and stewed, may be used in place of apples,\r\nif preferred.\r\n\r\nAPPLE TAPIOCA NO. 2.--Soak a half cup of tapioca in a cap of tepid\r\nwater, for at least three hours. Pare, core, and quarter nice tart\r\napples to fill a two-quart pudding dish nearly half full. Add four cups\r\nof water and one of sugar to the soaked tapioca, pour it over the\r\napples, and bake two or three hours in a slow oven. Serve with whipped\r\ncream.\r\n\r\nBANANA DESSERT.--Soak a cup of tapioca over night. In the morning\r\ncook in a double boiler in a quart of water until transparent. When\r\ndone, add a cup of sugar and three or four sliced bananas. Serve cold\r\nwith cream.\r\n\r\nBLACKBERRY TAPIOCA.--Soak a cup of tapioca over night. When ready\r\nto cook, add three cups of boiling water and cook in a double boiler\r\nuntil transparent and smooth. Sprinkle a quart of fresh blackberries\r\nwith sugar, and stir lightly into the tapioca. Pour into molds and serve\r\ncold with cream and sugar. Other fresh berries may be used in the same\r\nway.\r\n\r\nCHERRY PUDDING.--Soak and cook a half cup of tapioca in a pint of\r\nwater until transparent. Have a pint of fresh pitted cherries in an\r\nearthen pudding dish. Sprinkle them well with sugar, pour over them the\r\ncooked tapioca, and bake for an hour in a moderate oven. Serve hot with\r\nor without cream.\r\n\r\nFRUIT TAPIOCA.--Cook three fourths of a cup of tapioca in four cups\r\nof water until smooth and transparent Stir into it lightly a pint of\r\nfresh strawberries, raspberries, currants, or any small fruit, adding\r\nsugar as required. For variety a cup of canned quinces or apricots may\r\nbe substituted for fresh fruit. Serve warm or cold with whipped cream or\r\nmock cream.\r\n\r\nMOLDED TAPIOCA WITH FRUIT.--Simmer one half cup of desiccated\r\ncocoanut in a pint of milk for twenty minutes. Strain out the cocoanut,\r\nand add milk to make a full pint. Add one half cup of sugar and one half\r\ncup of tapioca previously soaked over night. Let the whole simmer until\r\nthe tapioca is transparent. Dip some cups in cold water, drain, and lay\r\nfresh strawberries, currants, or cherries in the bottom of each in the\r\nform of a star or cross. Pour the tapioca into the molds gently, so as\r\nnot to displace the fruit. When cold, turn out and serve with whipped\r\ncream or fruit sauce. Raisins may be substituted for fresh fruit, or\r\nbits of jelly may be placed around the mold after it has cooled, if\r\npreferred.\r\n\r\nPINEAPPLE TAPIOCA.--Soak one cup of tapioca over night in one and\r\none half cups of water. Add two and one half cups of water and cook in a\r\ndouble boiler until transparent, then add one cup of sugar and one juicy\r\npineapple minced fine with a sharp knife. Mold, and serve cold with or\r\nwithout cream.\r\n\r\nPRUNE AND TAPIOCA PUDDING.--Soak one half cup of tapioca over\r\nnight. In the morning cook until transparent in two cups of water. Stew\r\ntwo cups of well-washed and stoned prunes in a quart of water till\r\nperfectly tender; then add the juice of a good lemon and two\r\ntablespoonfuls of sugar, and boil till the syrup becomes thick and\r\nrich. Turn the prunes into a pudding dish, cover with the cooked\r\ntapioca, and add a little grated lemon rind. Bake lightly. Serve without\r\ndressing or with sugar and cream or almond sauce. If preferred, the\r\nprunes and tapioca may be placed in the dish in alternate layers, having\r\nthe top one of tapioca.\r\n\r\nTAPIOCA AND FIG PUDDING.--Cook three fourths of a cup of tapioca as\r\nfor Apple Tapioca. Have ready two cups of finely sliced or chopped tart\r\napples, and one cup of chopped figs, which have first been lightly\r\nsteamed. If preferred, raisins may be used in place of half the figs.\r\nPut the fruit in the bottom of the pudding dish, turn the tapioca over\r\nit, and bake till the fruit is very soft. If the apples are not very\r\ntart, sprinkle the juice of a lemon over them before adding the figs and\r\ntapioca.\r\n\r\nA nice fruit pudding can also be made by using half canned pears and\r\nhalf apples, or canned quinces may be substituted for figs.\r\n\r\nPEACH TAPIOCA.--For this will be needed a quart of nicely canned\r\npeaches, a cup of tapioca, and from one half to three fourths of a cup\r\nof sugar, according to the sweetness of the peaches. Soak the tapioca\r\nover night in just enough water to cover. When ready to cook, put in a\r\ndouble boiler with three cups of water, and cook for an hour. Remove\r\nfrom the fire and add to it the juice from the peaches, of which there\r\nshould be a cup and a half, which has been secured by draining the\r\npeaches in a colander, and stir it well into the tapioca. Place a layer\r\nof this mixture in an oiled pudding dish, add the peaches, cover with\r\nthe remainder of the tapioca, and bake for an hour in a moderate oven.\r\n\r\nTAPIOCA JELLY.--Soak a cup of tapioca in a pint of water over\r\nnight. Add another pint and cook until transparent and smooth. Add three\r\ntablespoonfuls of lemon juice and four tablespoonfuls of sugar; beat\r\nwell together and tun into molds. Serve cold. No dressing is required.\r\nThis may be varied by using unsweetened currant, grape, or other acid\r\nfruit juice in place of lemon. Fruit jelly may be used if the juice is\r\nnot easily obtained. Add when the tapioca is well cooked, and stir until\r\ndissolved.\r\n\r\nAPPLE SAGO PUDDING.--Soak one cup of sago in six cups of water;\r\nstew ten small apples, mix with the sago, and bake three quarters of an\r\nhour. Serve with cream and sugar. It is better warm than cold, but\r\nacceptable either way.\r\n\r\nRED SAGO MOLD.--Take a quart of red raspberry juice, pure or\r\ndiluted with one third water, and sweeten to taste. Have ready one half\r\ncup of best sago which has soaked for twenty minutes in just enough\r\nwater to cover. Drain off any water that may remain. Add the sago to the\r\njuice, and cook until the sago is transparent, then turn into molds.\r\nServe cold with cream. Cranberry or strawberry juice may be used in\r\nplace of the raspberry, if preferred.\r\n\r\nSAGO FRUIT PUDDING.--Soak a small cup of sago an hour in just\r\nenough water to cover. Drain off any water that may not be absorbed. Mix\r\ntwo thirds of a cup of sugar with this sago, and stir all into a quart\r\nof boiling water. Let it boil until the sago is perfectly transparent\r\nand pour in a pint of nicely hulled strawberries. Turn into molds to\r\ncool, or serve warm with cream, as preferred. Tapioca can be used\r\ninstead of sago, but needs longer soaking. Raspberries, stoned cherries,\r\nor currants can be used in place of strawberries.\r\n\r\nSAGO PUDDING.--Soak a cupful of sago for twenty minutes in a cup of\r\ncold water; then pour over it a quart and a cup of boiling water, add a\r\ncup of sugar and one half cup of raisins. Cook till the sago is\r\nperfectly transparent, flavor with vanilla, and set away to cool. Serve\r\nwith whipped cream.\r\n\r\nMANIOCA WITH FRUIT.--Pare, core, and quarter six medium-sized tart\r\napples, and put them to cook in a quart of boiling water. Add a cup of\r\nsugar, and cook without stirring until softened, then sprinkle into the\r\nwater in which they are cooking five tablespoonfuls of manioca, and cook\r\nuntil it is transparent, which will be in about ten minutes. Flavor with\r\na little grated lemon rind, and serve hot with sugar and cream, or mold,\r\nas preferred. Canned peaches, apricots, or cherries may be used in a\r\nsimilar manner, adding boiling water if there is not sufficient juice to\r\nproperly cook the manioca. Or the manioca may be first cooked in boiling\r\nwater, using four scant tablespoonfuls for a pint of water, and when\r\ntransparent, turning it over sliced bananas, pineapples, or oranges,\r\nmolding and serving with cream and sugar.\r\n\r\nRASPBERRY MANIOCA MOLD.--Heat a pint of water, and when boiling,\r\nsprinkle into it four scant tablespoonfuls of manioca and cook for ten\r\nminutes or until transparent, stirring continually. When transparent and\r\nthickened, remove from the fire and add a tablespoonful of lemon juice\r\nand one cup of sugar. Place a layer of the cooked manioca in the bottom\r\nof a pudding dish, add a layer of freshly picked red raspberries, then\r\nanother of the manioca, filling the dish in alternate layers with one of\r\nmanioca for the top. Set away in some cool place until well molded.\r\nServe in slices with cream flavored with rose. Other fresh berries may\r\nbe used instead of raspberries.\r\n\r\nSEA MOSS BLANCMANGE.--Wash the moss well in several waters, and\r\nsoak in a very little cold water for an hour before using. It is hardly\r\npossible to give exact directions for making this blancmange, owing to\r\nthe difficulty of accurately measuring the moss, but in general, a small\r\nhandful will be ample for a quart of milk. Add the moss, when washed, to\r\nthe milk, and cook in a double boiler until the milk has become\r\nthickened and glutinous. Add sugar to sweeten, flavor with vanilla or\r\nrose water, and strain through a fine sieve into cups previously wet in\r\ncold water, and mold. This may be varied by using boiling water instead\r\nof milk for cooking, adding the juice of one or two lemons and a little\r\ngrated rind to flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESSERTS MADE WITH GELATINE.\r\n\r\nGelatine is an article largely employed in making delicate and dainty\r\ndishes. It is economical and convenient, because the dessert can be\r\nprepared several hours before needed; but it must be stated that it has\r\nin itself little or no food value, and there is great liability of its\r\nbeing unwholesome. A writer in the _Anti-Adulteration Journal_, a short\r\ntime since, speaking of the use of gelatine, says:--\r\n\r\n\"The nutritive value of pure gelatine has been shown to be very low in\r\nthe scale of foods. The beef gelatine of the markets that is used by\r\nbakers, is far from being pure gelatine. It frequently has a very\r\ndisagreeable, fetid odor, and has evidently begun to decompose during\r\nthe process of manufacture. After a thorough drying, putrefaction does\r\nnot take place as long as it remains dry. But suppose that gelatine\r\nwhich has thus begun to decompose during the drying process, containing,\r\nperhaps, putrefactive germs in the dried state, be dissolved in water,\r\nand in hot weather, kept in this condition for a few hours previous to\r\nbeing used; the result would be rapid putrefaction. The putrefaction\r\nwould be checked by freezing; but the bacteria causing it are not killed\r\nby the low temperature. As soon as the dessert is melted or eaten, they\r\nresume their activity in the body, and may cause sickness. It is a\r\nwell-known fact that gelatine is an excellent medium in which to\r\ncultivate various kinds of micro-organisms; and if the conclusions here\r\nmentioned be correct, it seems that gelatine should be used with great\r\ncare in connection with food preparations. When used carelessly, it may\r\ndo a great deal of harm. I wish to impress those who use it with the\r\nimportance of guarding against its dangers. Gelatine should not be\r\nallowed to remain in solution for many hours before using, especially in\r\nhot weather.\r\n\r\n\"When used at all, the best varieties should be employed, and such as\r\nare free from putrefactive odor.\"\r\n\r\nA \"box\" of gelatine is used to signify a two-ounce package. If half a\r\nbox is called for, divide it by cutting the box and its contents in\r\nhalves rather than by emptying the box and then attempting to make a\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nTo prepare gelatine for desserts, first soak it till soft in a small\r\nquantity of cold water (a cupful to one box of gelatine is sufficient);\r\nfifteen minutes will suffice if it is stirred frequently; then dissolve\r\nin boiling liquid. Do not cook the gelatine, and after it is dissolved,\r\nalways strain through a cloth strainer before using.\r\n\r\nIn winter, a two-ounce package will solidify two quarts of liquid,\r\nincluding the water in which the gelatine is soaked. In summer, a little\r\nless liquid should be used. Gelatine desserts must be left on ice or in\r\na cool place until hardened, but they should not be served at the table\r\nso cold as to interfere with the digestion of other foods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nAPPLES IN JELLY.--Pare and core without cutting open, a half dozen\r\nmedium-sized tart apples of the same degree of hardness. Fill the\r\ncenters with a little grated lemon rind and sugar. Steam until tender\r\nbut not broken. Have ready half a package of gelatine which has been\r\nsoaked for an hour in just enough water to cover. Prepare a syrup with\r\none cup of sugar and a pint of water. When boiling, turn the syrup over\r\nthe gelatine, stirring well to dissolve it, and add the juice of half a\r\nlemon. Strain, place the apples in a deep dish with a little space\r\nbetween each; turn the mixture over them, and set in the ice box to\r\ncool. Serve with or without a little whipped cream.\r\n\r\nAPPLE SHAPE.--Steam some nice tart apples. When tender, rub through\r\na colander. Have two thirds of a box of gelatine soaked in just enough\r\nwater to cover; pour over it a cup and a half of boiling water; when\r\nwell dissolved, strain and add a pint of the sifted apples sweetened to\r\ntaste, and one half cup of grated fresh or canned pineapple, or if\r\npreferred, one half cup of the juice of canned pineapple. Turn into cups\r\npreviously wet in cold water, and mold. Serve with a little cream.\r\nCanned peaches, apricots, and other fruit may be used the same as\r\napples, if preferred. Rub the fruit with but little juice through a\r\ncolander, and proceed as above.\r\n\r\nBANANA DESSERT.--Dissolve half a box of gelatine in a half cup of\r\nwarm water. Heat three cups of rich milk to boiling, and add to it one\r\ncup of sugar and turn over the well-dissolved gelatine and strain. Let\r\nit partly cool, and mix in three or four bananas, sliced thin or chopped\r\nfine. Turn all into a mold previously wet with cold water, and leave\r\ntill hardened, which may require several hours unless the mold be placed\r\non ice. When well molded, turn into a glass dish, serve with whipped\r\ncream flavored with vanilla or lemon.\r\n\r\nCLEAR DESSERT.--Soak a box of gelatine in a large bowl with half a\r\ncup of cold water. When soft, pour over it three pints of boiling water,\r\nadd the juice of three large lemons and two cups of sugar. Stir well,\r\nstrain, and pour into molds previously wet with cold water. Put into the\r\nrefrigerator until hardened. Serve with whipped cream. Quince, apricot,\r\norange, or pineapple juice may be substituted for lemon, and thus a\r\nvariety of desserts may be made.\r\n\r\nFRUIT FOAM DESSERT.--Soak half a package of gelatine in half a cup\r\nof cold water until soft. Heat to boiling two and one half cups of red\r\nraspberry, currant, strawberry, or grape juice, sweetened to taste, and\r\npour over the soaked gelatine. Stir until perfectly dissolved, then\r\nstrain, and set the dish in ice water to cool. When it is cold and\r\nbeginning to thicken, beat the whites of three eggs to a stiff froth and\r\nstir into the thickening gelatine. Beat thoroughly for fifteen minutes\r\nwith an egg beater, or whip till the whole is of a solid foam stiff\r\nenough to retain its shape. Turn into molds previously wet with cold\r\nwater, or pile roughly in large spoonfuls in a glass dish. Set away in\r\nthe refrigerator until needed. Serve with a little whipped cream piled\r\nlightly around it.\r\n\r\nFRUIT SHAPE.--Take a quart of nicely canned red raspberries,\r\nsweetened to taste; turn into a colander and drain off the juice, taking\r\ncare to keep the fruit as perfect as possible. Put two thirds of a box\r\nof gelatine to soak in just enough of the juice to cover. When the\r\ngelatine is ready, heat the remainder of the juice to boiling and pour\r\nover it. When well dissolved, add the fruit, turn into cups, and mold.\r\nServe with cream. Peaches, strawberries, apricots, and other canned\r\nfruit may be used in place of the raspberries, if preferred.\r\n\r\nGELATINE CUSTARD.--Soak a quarter of a box of gelatine in one\r\nfourth of a cup of cold water till soft; then pour over it three fourths\r\nof a cup of boiling water, and stir until dissolved. Beat the yolks of\r\ntwo eggs and three tablespoonfuls of sugar to a cream; pour over it\r\nslowly, stirring continuously, a pint of boiling milk, and cook in a\r\ndouble boiler until it thickens. Then add the gelatine mixture, which\r\nshould first be strained, the whites of the two eggs beaten stiff, and a\r\nlittle vanilla for flavoring. Beat all well together, turn into molds\r\npreviously wet in cold water, and place on ice to harden. Serve with\r\nfruit sauce.\r\n\r\nLAYER PUDDING.--Divide a package of gelatine into three portions,\r\nand put each to soak in one third of a cup of cold water. Heat one and\r\none fourths cups of water to boiling, add the juice of one lemon and two\r\nthirds of a cup of sugar. Turn this slowly, stirring well meanwhile,\r\nover the well-beaten yolks of two eggs. Cook in a double boiler five\r\nminutes, or until the mixture thickens. Pour the hot custard over one\r\nportion of the soaked gelatine, and stir it until dissolved. Strain, add\r\na little grated lemon rind for flavoring, and turn into a broad, shallow\r\ndish to mold. A square granite-ware baking tin is admirable for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nTake one and one half cups of raspberry, strawberry, grape, or currant\r\njuice, sweetened to taste; heat to boiling and pour over the second\r\nportion of the soaked gelatine. Stir till well dissolved, strain, and\r\nturn into a shallow mold like that containing the first portion.\r\n\r\nHeat one and one half cups of rich milk to boiling, add one half cup of\r\nsugar, and pour over the third portion of soaked gelatine. Strain and\r\ncool a little, flavor with vanilla or a few chopped bananas; or, if\r\npreferred, flavor the milk with cocoanut before using, as directed on\r\npage 298. Pour into a third mold like the others to cool. When all are\r\ncold, arrange in layers, the yellow at the bottom and the white at the\r\ntop. The whites of the eggs may be used for meringue, or for making a\r\nwhipped cream sauce to serve with the pudding.\r\n\r\nLEMON JELLY.--Soak one half box of gelatine in a scant cup of cold\r\nwater until soft. Then pour over it one pint of boiling water and stir\r\nuntil well dissolved. Add one cup of sugar, the yellow rind of one\r\nlemon, and one half cup of lemon juice. Strain, put into molds\r\npreviously wet in cold water, and place in the ice chest to harden. If\r\npreferred, the above may be cooled in a shallow dish and cut into\r\nirregular shapes to be served with a custard sauce. Use only the yolks\r\nof eggs in making the custard, that it may have a rich color, using two\r\nyolks in place of one whole egg.\r\n\r\nJELLY WITH FRUIT.--Soak a package of gelatine in a cup of cold\r\nwater until soft; then pour over it one quart and a cup of boiling\r\nwater. Strain, add the juice of four lemons and twelve tablespoonfuls of\r\nsugar. Cool a little of the gelatine in a mold, and as soon as set,\r\nscatter in some nice currants or seedless raisins; add another layer of\r\ngelatine, and when set, scatter in more fruit; continue until the mold\r\nis full, having gelatine at the top. Fresh fruit, currants, grapes,\r\ncherries, plums, peaches, etc., may be used in place of raisins, if\r\npreferred.\r\n\r\nORANGE DESSERT.--Soak one third of a cup of gelatine in one third\r\nof a cup of cold water until soft; then pour over it one third of a cup\r\nof boiling water. Add a scant cup of sugar, the juice of one lemon, and\r\na cupful of orange juice and pulp. Set the dish containing the mixture\r\nin a pan of ice water until it begins to harden. Have ready the whites\r\nof three eggs well whipped, add to the jelly, and beat all together\r\nuntil light and stiff enough to drop. Pour into molds wet in cold water,\r\nand lined with sections of oranges, from which seeds and white fiber\r\nhave been removed.\r\n\r\nORANGES IN JELLY.--Pare divide, and take out the seeds from four or\r\nfive sweet oranges, being careful to remove all the white rind and\r\nshreds. Place in a deep dish and pour over them a syrup prepared as for\r\nApples in Jelly, using the juice of a whole lemon. Set in the ice box\r\nover night. A very little orange peel may be grated into the syrup if\r\nliked; and if the oranges are very sweet, less sugar will be required.\r\nIf one can afford to use orange juice in place of the water in making\r\nthe syrup, the dessert will be greatly improved.\r\n\r\nORANGE JELLY.--Soak one quarter of a box of gelatine until soft in\r\njust enough cold water to cover. Then pour over it one half cup of\r\nboiling water. Stir until well dissolved, add the juice of one small\r\nlemon, one cupful of orange juice, and one half cup of sugar. Strain,\r\nturn into molds previously wet in cold water, and set on ice to harden.\r\nStrawberry, raspberry, and other fruit juices may be used in a similar\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nSNOW PUDDING.--Soak one fourth of a box of gelatine until soft in\r\nan equal measure of cold water. Then pour over it one cup of boiling\r\nwater, and add one fourth of a cup of strained lemon juice and one cup\r\nof sugar; stir till the sugar is all dissolved. Strain into a large\r\nchina dish, and set in ice water to cool. Let it stand until cold and\r\nbeginning to thicken. Have ready the whites of three eggs beaten to a\r\nstiff froth, and add to the gelatine as it begins to thicken; beat all\r\ntogether for fifteen or twenty minutes, until it is of a solid foam and\r\nstiff enough to hold its shape. Turn into molds and keep in a cool place\r\ntill needed. A half dozen finely sliced or chopped bananas stirred in\r\ntoward the last, makes a nice variation. Serve with custard sauce made\r\nwith the yolks of the eggs and flavored with rose or vanilla. Orange,\r\nquince, or pineapple juice may be substituted for lemon, for a change.\r\n\r\nThis dessert is best if made several hours before it is needed and set\r\nin the refrigerator to keep cold.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESSERTS WITH CRUSTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nAPPLE TART.--Pare and slice some quick-cooking, tart apples, and\r\nplace them in the bottom of a pudding dish, with a tablespoonful of\r\nwater. Cover with a crust prepared in the following manner: Into a cup\r\nof thin cream stir a gill of yeast and two cups of flour; let this\r\nbecome very light, then add sufficient flour to mix soft. Knead for\r\nfifteen or twenty minutes very thoroughly, roll evenly, and cover the\r\napples; put all in a warm place until the crust has become very light,\r\nthen bake. If the apples do not bake easily, they may be partially\r\ncooked before putting on the crust. Dish so that the fruit will be\r\nuppermost, and serve cold with cream and sugar, cocoanut sauce, or mock\r\ncream.\r\n\r\nGOOSEBERRY TART.--Fill a pudding dish with well prepared green\r\ngooseberries, adding a tablespoonful or two of water. Cover with a crust\r\nas for Apple Tart, and when light, bake in a moderately quick oven. Cut\r\nthe crust into the required number of pieces, and dish with gooseberries\r\nheaped on top. Serve cold with sugar and cream.\r\n\r\nCHERRY TART.--Prepare the same as for Apple Tart, with stoned\r\ncherries, only omitting the water, as the cherries will be sufficiently\r\njuicy of themselves. If the fruit is very juicy, sprinkle a\r\ntablespoonful of flour over it before putting on the crust. Plum and\r\npeach tart may be made in the same manner, and are both very nice.\r\n\r\nSTRAWBERRY AND OTHER FRUIT SHORTCAKES.--Beat together one cup of\r\nthin cream, slightly warmed, a tablespoonful of yeast, and two small\r\ncups of flour. Set in a warm place till very light. Add sufficient warm\r\nflour to mix soft, and knead thoroughly for fifteen or twenty minutes.\r\nDivide into two equal portions, and roll into sheets about one half inch\r\nin thickness, making the center a very little thinner than the edges, so\r\nthat when risen, the center will not be highest. Place in tins, and set\r\nin a warm place until perfectly risen, or until they have doubled their\r\nfirst thickness. Bake quickly. When cold, spread one cake with fruit,\r\nand cover with the other. If the fruit is large, it may be chopped fine\r\nwith a knife, or mashed with a spoon. A little lemon juice added to\r\npeaches is an addition for shortcake.\r\n\r\nBANANA SHORTCAKE.--Prepare the crust as previously directed. Fill\r\nwith sliced bananas, for every three of which add the juice of one\r\norange, a little of the grated rind, and a half cup of sugar.\r\n\r\nLEMON SHORTCAKE.--Prepare the crust as for Fruit Shortcake. For the\r\nfilling, grate the yellow portion only of the lemon, and squeeze the\r\njuice into a bowl; add a cupful of sugar. Braid a tablespoonful of flour\r\nsmooth with two tablespoonfuls of water, add enough boiling water,\r\nstirring well meanwhile, to make a teacupful. Add this to the other\r\ningredients, beat well together, and place the bowl in a basin of\r\nboiling water or over the teakettle. Cook until about as thick as boiled\r\ncustard. Fill this between the shortcakes and serve.\r\n\r\nBERRY SHORTCAKE WITH PREPARED CREAM.--Prepare the shortcake as\r\npreviously directed. Sweeten the berries and spread on the lower crust,\r\nthen pour over them a \"cream\" prepared as follows, and add top crust:--\r\n\r\nCREAM.--Heat one half cup of milk and the same of thin cream to\r\nboiling, add two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and thicken with one\r\nteaspoonful of cornstarch rubbed smooth in a little cold milk. Turn the\r\nhot sauce over the beaten white of two eggs, stirring rapidly meanwhile,\r\nuntil the egg is thoroughly mingled with the whole. Allow it to become\r\ncold before using.\r\n\r\nRAISED PIE.--Prepare the dough as for shortcake. Divide in two\r\nportions, spread one on the tin, and cover with a layer of easy-cooking\r\ntart apples sliced in eighths. Put two or three spoonfuls of rather\r\nthick sweet cream over the apples, and cover with the top crust. Let the\r\ncrusts rise until very light, and bake. Peaches may be used in the same\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nBAKED APPLE LOAF.--Prepare some dough as for buns on page 347,\r\nleaving out the sugar, and when ready for the last melding, cut it into\r\nthree portions. Put some flour on the bread board, mold the dough well,\r\nand roll as thin as pie crust in such shape as will fit a shallow baking\r\ntin. Spread over the tin, and cover the dough with a layer of\r\neasy-cooking, sour apples sliced very thin, or with very stiff apple\r\nmarmalade. Cover this with a second layer of dough, then add another\r\nlayer of apples, and cover with the third portion of the dough. Pinch\r\nthe edges of the dough well together, let the loaf rise till very light,\r\nthen bake. Eat cold with sugar and cream. If the apples will not cook\r\nquickly, they may be first steamed until nearly tender. If the crust\r\nappears too hard when taken from the oven, cover with a wet napkin and\r\nallow it to steam for a little time until softened.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUSTARD PUDDINGS.\r\n\r\nVery much depends upon the baking in all puddings made with milk and\r\neggs.\r\n\r\nA custard pudding made with one egg, and slowly baked, will be much\r\nthicker and nicer than one made with more eggs, baked in too hot an\r\noven.\r\n\r\nA custard pudding baked too quickly or too long will have the eggs mixed\r\nwith the farinaceous substance and the milk turned to whey, while one\r\nmore carefully baked will have eggs and milk formed into a thick custard\r\non the top.\r\n\r\nCustard puddings and all other baked puddings which require to be cooked\r\nslowly, are best cooked in an earthen dish set in the oven in a pan of\r\nhot water, and baked only till the pudding is set. If it is desirable\r\nto use with eggs any ingredient which requires a lengthy cooking, it is\r\nmuch better to cook it partially before adding the eggs. Many custard\r\ndesserts are much more dainty and more easily served when cooked in cups\r\nthan when baked in a large dish. The blue willow pattern stoneware cups\r\nand the blue and white Japanese ware are very suitable for this purpose.\r\nWhen cooking, set the cups, allowing one for each person, in the oven in\r\na dripping pan containing hot water, and bake. Serve without removing\r\nfrom the cups.\r\n\r\nIf desired to stir beaten eggs into heated milk, add a few spoonfuls of\r\ncold milk to the eggs, and pour the mixture, a little at a time, into\r\nthe hot milk, taking care to stir it constantly.\r\n\r\nA nice way to flavour custards and meringues for custard puddings is to\r\nbeat fruit jelly with the whites of the eggs; red raspberry, quince, and\r\npineapple jellies give especially nice flavours.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nAPPLE CUSTARD.--Bake good tart apples; when done, remove the pulp,\r\nand rub through a sieve; sweeten, and flavour with grated pineapple or\r\ngrated orange or lemon rind. Put in a glass dish, and cover with a plain\r\ncustard prepared as directed on page 328. Bits of jelly may be scattered\r\nover the top of the custard.\r\n\r\nAPPLE CUSTARD NO. 2.--Peel, halve, and core eight or ten\r\nmedium-sized sour apples. Have prepared a syrup made with a cup of\r\nwater, the juice of one lemon, a little grated rind, and a half cup of\r\nsugar. When the sugar is dissolved, add the fruit, and simmer till\r\ntender but not fallen to pieces. Skim out the apples, draining\r\nthoroughly, and lay them in a glass dish. Boil up the syrup until thick,\r\nand poor it over the apples. Make a soft boiled custard with a pint of\r\nmilk, yolks of three eggs, and two tablespoonfuls of sugar. When cold,\r\nspread over the apples; whip the whites to a stiff froth, flavor with\r\nlemon, and pile irregularly upon the top. Brown lightly in the oven.\r\n\r\nAPPLE CUSTARD NO. 3.--Pare and remove the cores from a dozen tart\r\napples, and fill the cavities with black raspberry, quince, or grape\r\njelly. Put them in a covered baking dish with a tablespoonful of water,\r\nand steam in the oven till tender but not fallen to pieces. Then cover\r\nthe apples with a raw custard made by cooking two tablespoonfuls of\r\nflour rubbed smooth with a little milk, in a quart of milk, till just\r\nthickened, and adding, when cold, the yolks of two eggs well beaten\r\nwith two heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar, and lastly the whites of the\r\neggs whipped to a stiff froth. Bake in a dish set in a pan of hot water,\r\nuntil the custard has set, but not till it separates.\r\n\r\nAPPLE CORNSTARCH CUSTARD.--Cover the bottom of a small earthen-ware\r\npudding dish an inch or more in depth with apples stewed until very dry,\r\nsweetened and flavored with a teaspoonful of rose water. Heat a cup of\r\nmilk to boiling, and stir into it a tablespoonful of cornstarch rubbed\r\nsmooth in a little cold milk, and one fourth cup of sugar; cook until\r\nthickened, then add the yolk of one egg, and pour the whole over the\r\napple. Meringue the top with the white of the egg beaten stiff with a\r\ntablespoonful of sugar, and flavored with a little rose water.\r\n\r\nAPPLE AND BREAD CUSTARD.--For this is required one cup of finely\r\nrolled bread crumbs, two eggs, one half cup of sugar, one cup minced\r\nsour apples, and one quart of milk. Beat the sugar and yolks together,\r\nadd the milk, bread, and fruit, and lastly the well-beaten whites of the\r\neggs. Bake in a dish set in a pan of hot water till firm but not dry.\r\n\r\nALMOND CORNSTARCH PUDDING.--Blanch one and one half ounces of sweet\r\nalmonds, and reduce them to a paste as directed on page 298; or if\r\nobtainable, almondine may be used instead of the prepared almonds. Heat\r\na quart of milk, and while boiling, stir into it four tablespoonfuls of\r\ncornstarch which has been braided smooth with a little cold milk; let it\r\nthicken over the fire, stirring all the time. Then add two\r\ntablespoonfuls of thick, sweet cream. Lastly, stir in two or three\r\nwell-beaten eggs and a tablespoonful of rose water. Let it come just to\r\nthe boiling point, and remove from the stove. Keep in a cold place till\r\nneeded. Serve with hot mock cream or with grape pulp as dressing.\r\n\r\nALMOND CREAM.--Heat a pint of milk, and when boiling stir into it\r\ntwo tablespoonfuls of cornstarch rubbed smooth in a little cold milk,\r\nalso one fourth cup of sugar and three tablespoonfuls of almondine. Cook\r\nuntil thickened, and pour it, stirring constantly meanwhile, over the\r\nbeaten whites of two eggs. Set on ice to cool, and serve with grape pulp\r\nas dressing. A cupful of blanched and chopped almonds may be used\r\ninstead of almondine if that is not obtainable. The pudding will then\r\nrequire an additional one fourth cup of sugar.\r\n\r\nAPPLE CHARLOTTE.--Take three cups of nicely stewed tart apples\r\nwhich have been beaten smooth or rubbed through a colander and sweetened\r\nto taste. If the sauce is thin and very juicy, place it upon the range,\r\nand simmer slowly till it is of the consistency of thick marmalade or\r\njelly. Add to the apples four tablespoonfuls of grated fresh or canned\r\npineapple for flavoring. Remove the hard crusts from slices of light\r\nwhole-wheat bread, spread them quite thickly with the prepared apple,\r\nand pack in layers in a pudding mold. Cover with a simple custard made\r\nof a quart of milk, three tablespoonfuls of sugar, and two eggs. Let it\r\nstand half an hour, then bake. Do not press the bread or beat it after\r\nthe custard is turned on, as that will be likely to make the pudding\r\nheavy. Other fruit marmalade may be used in place of the apple\r\npreparation if preferred.\r\n\r\nBANANA CUSTARD.--Prepare a custard as directed for Plain Custard\r\nwith a quart of milk, two well-beaten eggs, four tablespoonfuls of\r\nsugar, and one of cornstarch. When the custard is cool, pour it over\r\nfour thinly sliced yellow bananas, over which a tablespoonful of sugar\r\nand a teaspoonful of water have been sprinkled. Serve cold.\r\n\r\nBOILED CUSTARD.--Beat thoroughly together one pint of milk, two\r\neggs, and a tablespoonful or two of sugar, until thoroughly mingled.\r\nTurn the mixture into a double boiler, and cook until the custard is\r\nset.\r\n\r\nBOILED CUSTARD BREAD PUDDING.--Crumble enough of the soft portion\r\nof stale whole-wheat bread to lightly fill a pint bowl. Heat a pint of\r\nmilk to boiling. Stir into it, as soon as it boils, two eggs, yolks and\r\nwhites well beaten separately, two heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar, a\r\nlittle grated lemon rind, and the light bread crumbs; stir rapidly till\r\nthe whole thickens, pour into a deep dish, and when cold, dot the top\r\nwith bits of currant or cranberry jelly.\r\n\r\nBREAD AND FRUIT CUSTARD.--Take for this, two cups of grated bread\r\ncrumbs, two cups of finely chopped tart apples, one cup of English\r\ncurrants or stoned raisins, mixed with a very little chopped citron for\r\nflavor, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, three cups of milk, and two eggs.\r\nBeat the yolks of the eggs and the sugar together, then add the milk,\r\nbread, fruit, and lastly the well-beaten whites of the eggs. Bake in a\r\ndish set within a pan of hot water, until the custard is set.\r\n\r\nBREAD CUSTARD PUDDING.--Take one cup of finely powdered bread\r\ncrumbs, one half cup of sugar, one quart of milk, and the beaten yolks\r\nof three eggs and whites of two. Mix the bread and milk, and when well\r\nsoftened, add the beaten yolks, sugar, and lastly the well-beaten\r\nwhites; beat all together thoroughly, season with a little grated lemon\r\nrind; place the pudding dish in the oven in a pan of hot water, and bake\r\ntill firm and lightly brown. Take from the oven, cover the top with a\r\nlayer of apple marmalade made without sugar, or with some tart fruit\r\njelly; add to this a meringue made of the white of the remaining egg and\r\na tablespoonful of sugar, beaten to a stiff froth, and place in the oven\r\na moment to brown lightly.\r\n\r\nFresh fruit, strawberries, raspberries, chopped peaches, currants,\r\ncherries, or shredded oranges are equally as good as the marmalade or\r\njelly for the top dressing, and may be used to vary this pudding in a\r\nnumber of different ways. Canned fruits, if well drained from juice,\r\nespecially apricots and peaches, are excellent for this purpose. A\r\ncocoanut custard pudding may be made of the above by flavoring the milk\r\nbefore using, with two tablespoonfuls of desiccated cocoanut Another\r\nvariety still may be made by adding to the first recipe half a cup of\r\nZante currants and the same of seedless raisins, or a half cup of finely\r\nshredded, tender citron.\r\n\r\nBREAD AND FIG PUDDING.--Put together two cups of finely grated\r\nbread crumbs, two cups of milk, one cup of finely chopped figs\r\npreviously steamed or cooked, one fourth cup of sugar, and lastly, two\r\nwell-beaten eggs. Bake in a moderate oven till the custard is set.\r\n\r\nBREAD AND APRICOT PUDDING.--Fill a pudding dish with alternate\r\nlayers of bread crumbs and canned apricots well drained from juice. Pour\r\nover it a custard made with two eggs, one half cup of sugar, and a pint\r\nof milk. Bake one half hour, or only until the custard is set. Canned\r\npeaches, to which a teaspoonful of lemon juice has been added after\r\ndraining, may be used in place of apricots.\r\n\r\nCARAMEL CUSTARD.--Turn one fourth of a cup of sugar into a stewpan,\r\nand stir it over the fire until it becomes liquid and brown. Scald a cup\r\nand a half of milk, and add the browned sugar. Beat two eggs thoroughly,\r\nadd to them one half cup cold milk, and turn the mixture slowly,\r\nstirring constantly that no lumps form, into the scalding milk; continue\r\nto stir until the custard thickens. Set away to cool, and serve in\r\nglasses.\r\n\r\nCARROT PUDDING.--Take two cups of carrots, boiled tender and rubbed\r\nthrough a colander, one pint of milk, two thirds of a cup of sugar, and\r\ntwo well beaten eggs. Flavor with vanilla, and having beaten all well\r\ntogether, turn into an earthen pudding dish, set the dish in a pan of\r\nhot water, and place in the oven. Bake only till the custard sets.\r\n\r\nCOCOANUT CORNSTARCH PUDDING.--Simmer a cupful of grated cocoanut in\r\na quart of milk for twenty minutes. Strain the milk to remove the\r\ncocoanut, adding enough more milk to make a full quart. With a small\r\nportion of it braid smoothly one and one half tablespoonfuls of\r\ncornstarch or rice flour, and put the remainder in a saucepan over the\r\nfire. When the milk is boiling, add the cornstarch, stirring constantly\r\nuntil it thickens; then remove from the fire and cool. Next add two\r\ntablespoonfuls of sugar and two well-beaten eggs. Bake in a moderate\r\noven, in a dish set in a pan of hot water, until the custard is well\r\nset.\r\n\r\nCOCOANUT CUSTARD.--Flavor a pint of milk with cocoanut, add a\r\ntablespoonful of sugar and two well-beaten eggs, and boil till set in a\r\ndouble boiler or a bowl set in a dish of boiling water. Richer custards\r\nmay be made by using three or four eggs, but the richer the custard the\r\nmore likely it is to curdle and become watery, as well as being less\r\nwholesome.\r\n\r\nCOCONUT RICE CUSTARD.--Flavor one quart of milk quite strongly\r\nwith coconut, as previously directed. Add to it one and one half cups of\r\nboiled rice, one cup of raisins, one half cup of sugar, and lastly three\r\nwell-beaten eggs. Set the pudding dish in a pan of hot water, and bake\r\ntill the custard is well set.\r\n\r\nCORN MEAL PUDDING.--Heat a quart of milk lacking two thirds of a\r\ncupful, to boiling. Moisten three tablespoonfuls of nice granulated corn\r\nmeal with the two thirds of a cup of milk, and stir gradually into the\r\nboiling milk. Let it boil up until set, turn into a double boiler, and\r\ncook for an hour. Then add a tablespoonful of thick sweet cream, one\r\nhalf a cup of molasses or sugar, a quart of cold milk, a little salt if\r\ndesired, and lastly, two well-beaten eggs. Mix thoroughly. Pour into a\r\npudding dish and bake one hour. A cup of currants or seeded raisins may\r\nbe used to give variety.\r\n\r\nCORN MEAL PUDDING NO. 2.--Crumble cold corn puffs or corn cake to\r\nmake a cupful; add a pint of sweet milk, three teaspoonfuls of sugar,\r\nthe yolks of two eggs and the white of one, and bake slowly in a dish\r\nset inside a pan of hot water for an hour.\r\n\r\nCORN MEAL AND FIG PUDDING.--Beat together a scant cup of best\r\nsifted corn meal with a cupful of molasses, and stir the mixture\r\ngradually into a quart of boiling milk. Cook ten or twelve minutes, or\r\nuntil well thickened, then set aside to cool. Add a cupful of finely\r\nchopped figs, one and two thirds cups of cold milk, part cream if it can\r\nbe afforded, and when the mixture is cool, add two well-beaten eggs.\r\nPour into a pudding dish and bake in a moderate, steady oven for three\r\nor more hours; the longer the better. When the pudding has baked an\r\nhour, pour over it a cupful of cold milk. Do not stir the pudding, but\r\nallow the milk to soak in gradually, a pint of finely sliced or chopped\r\nsweet apples may be used in place of figs for variety, or if preferred,\r\nboth may be omitted.\r\n\r\nCORNSTARCH MERINGUE.--Heat one and one half pints of milk to\r\nboiling, and then stir in gradually two tablespoonfuls of cornstarch\r\nwhich has been previously rubbed smooth in a little cold milk. When the\r\nstarch has thickened, allow it partially to cool, and then add, stirring\r\ncontinuously meanwhile, the yolks of two eggs which have been previously\r\nwell beaten with three table spoonfuls of sugar. Let the whole simmer\r\nfor a minute or two longer, turn into a dish, meringue with the whites\r\nof the eggs, and when cold, dot with lumps of strawberry jelly.\r\n\r\nCRACKED WHEAT PUDDING.--Beat two cups of cold steamed cracked wheat\r\nin two cups of rich milk until so thoroughly mingled that no lumps\r\nremain. Add one cup of canned sweet cherries well drained from juice,\r\none half cup of sugar, and two eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately.\r\nBake in a slow oven till the custard is set.\r\n\r\nCUP CUSTARD.--Into four cups of milk stir the yolks of three eggs\r\nand one whole one well beaten. Add four tablespoonfuls of sugar, and\r\nstrain the mixture into cups; place these in a dripping pan full of hot\r\nwater, grate a little lemon rind over the top of each, and bake in a\r\nmoderate oven. If preferred, the milk may be first flavoured with\r\ncocoanut. It is also better to have the milk nearly hot when stirring in\r\nthe egg. Half a cupful of the milk should be reserved to add to the egg\r\nbefore turning into the heated portion.\r\n\r\nFARINA CUSTARD.--Flavor a quart of milk with cocoanut as directed\r\non page 298. Cook two tablespoonfuls of farina in the flavored milk for\r\ntwenty minutes, in a double boiler; then set aside to cool. When nearly\r\ncold, add two tablespoonfuls of sugar and the well-beaten yolks of two\r\neggs. Beat all together very thoroughly, and lastly stir in the whites\r\nof the eggs which have been previously beaten to a stiff froth. Bake in\r\none dish set inside another filled with hot water, just long enough to\r\nset the custard. Serve cold.\r\n\r\nFARINA PUDDING.--Take a cup of cold cooked farina and soak it in\r\nfour cups of milk until there are no lumps, or rub through a colander;\r\nadd two well-beaten eggs, one scant cup of sugar and one cup of raisins;\r\nbake in a moderate oven until the custard is well set.\r\n\r\nFLOATING ISLAND.--Make a custard of a pint of milk flavored with\r\ncocoanut, and the yolks of three eggs; sweeten to taste, and steam in a\r\ndouble boiler. When done, turn into a glass dish. Have the whites of the\r\neggs whipped to a stiff froth, and drop for a few seconds on the top of\r\na pan of scalding hot water, turning so that both sides may be alike\r\ncoagulated but not hardened; skim off, and put in islands on the top of\r\nthe custard. When quite cold, drop bits of different colored jellies on\r\nthe islands, and keep in a cool place till needed. Or put a spoonful of\r\nfruit jelly in the bottom of small glasses, and fill with the custard\r\nwith a spoonful of the white on top.\r\n\r\nFRUIT CUSTARD.--Heat a pint of red raspberry, strawberry, or\r\ncurrant juice to boiling, and stir into it two tablespoonfuls or\r\ncornstarch rubbed smooth in a little cold water. Stir constantly until\r\nthickened, then add half a cup of sugar, or less if the fruit juice has\r\nbeen sweetened; take from the fire and stir in the stiffly beaten whites\r\nof three eggs, stirring all the time so that the hot mixture will\r\ncoagulate the egg. Make a custard of a pint of milk, the yolks of the\r\nthree eggs, and three tablespoonfuls of sugar. When done, set on the ice\r\nto cool. Dish in a glass dish when cold, placing the fruit mixture by\r\nspoonfuls on top, and serve.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM GRITS PUDDING.--Heat two cups of milk in a double boiler.\r\nWhen boiling, stir in one cup of Graham grits moistened with one cup of\r\ncold milk.

Serve either cold or hot.\r\n\r\nLEMON CORNSTARCH PUDDING NO. 2.--Mix together one half cup of\r\ncornstarch, one half cup of sugar, the juice and a portion of the grated\r\nrind of one medium-sized lemon. Add to these ingredients just enough\r\ncold water to dissolve thoroughly, then pour boiling water over the\r\nmixture until it becomes thickened and looks transparent. Stir\r\ncontinuously and boil for a few minutes until the starch is cooked. Take\r\nfrom the fire, and add gradually, with continuous stirring, the\r\nwell-beaten yolks of three eggs. Whip the whites of the eggs with a\r\nteaspoonful of quince jelly to a stiff froth, and pour over the pudding;\r\nthen brown in the oven. Orange juice with a very little of the grated\r\nrind, or pineapple juice may be substituted for the lemon, if preferred.\r\n\r\nMACARONI PUDDING.--Break sufficient macaroni to make a pint in inch\r\nlengths, put into a double boiler, turn over it three pints of milk, and\r\ncook until tender. Turn into a pudding dish, add a pint of cold milk,\r\ntwo thirds of a cup of sugar, one egg, and the yolks of two others well\r\nbeaten. Bake from twenty minutes to one half hour.

When perfectly cold, place in a glass dish, and\r\npour over them a cold custard made of a pint of milk, half a cup of\r\nsugar, a teaspoonful of cornstarch, and one egg. Or, if preferred, the\r\nrice balls may be served in individual dishes with the custard sauce, or\r\nwith a dressing of fruit juice.\r\n\r\nORANGE FLOAT.--Heat one quart of water, the juice of two lemons,\r\nand one and one half cupfuls of sugar. When boiling, stir into it four\r\ntablespoonfuls of cornstarch rubbed smooth in a very little water. Cook\r\nuntil the whole is thickened and clear. When cool, stir into the mixture\r\nfive nice oranges which have been sliced, and freed from seeds and all\r\nthe white portions. Meringue, and serve cold.\r\n\r\nORANGE CUSTARD.--Turn a pint of hot milk over two cups of stale\r\nbread crumbs and let them soak until well softened: add the yolks of two\r\neggs, and beat all together until perfectly smooth; add a little of the\r\ngrated rind and the juice of three sweet oranges, and sugar to taste.\r\nLastly add the whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff froth, turn into\r\ncups, which place into a moderate oven in a pan of hot water, and bake\r\ntwenty minutes, or until the custard is well set but not watery.\r\n\r\nORANGE PUDDING.--Pare and slice six sweet Florida oranges, removing\r\nthe seeds and all the white skin and fibers. Place in the bottom of a\r\nglass dish. Make a custard by stirring two table spoonfuls of cornstarch\r\nbraided with a little milk into a pint of boiling milk, and when\r\nthickened, adding gradually, stirring constantly meanwhile, one egg and\r\nthe yolk of a second egg well beaten with one fourth cup of sugar. When\r\npartially cool, pour over the oranges. Whip the white of the second egg\r\nto a stiff froth with one fourth cup of sugar which has been flavored by\r\nrubbing over some orange peel, and meringue the top of the pudding.\r\nFresh strawberries, raspberries, or peaches may be substituted for\r\noranges in making this dessert, if preferred.\r\n\r\nPEACH MERINGUE.--To every pint of stewed or canned peaches,\r\nsweetened to taste, stir in the beaten yolks of two eggs. Bake in a deep\r\npudding dish fifteen minutes, then cover with the whites of the two eggs\r\nbeaten till very light with two tablespoonfuls of sugar. Brown in the\r\noven, and serve cold with whipped cream. For peaches, substitute any\r\nother stewed fruit desired.\r\n\r\nPICNIC PUDDING.--Thicken a pint of strawberry or raspberry juice,\r\nsweetened to taste, with two tablespoonfuls of corn starch, as for Fruit\r\nCustard. Turn into the bottom of cups previously wet with cold water,\r\nor a large mold, as preferred. In a second dish heat to boiling a pint\r\nof milk, flavored with cocoanut, to which a tablespoonful of sugar has\r\nbeen, added. Stir into it two tablespoonfuls of cornstarch rubbed smooth\r\nin a little cold milk, and cook thoroughly. When done, cool slightly and\r\nturn into the molds on the top of the pink portion, which should be\r\nsufficiently cool so that it will not mix. A third layer may be added by\r\ncooking two tablespoonfuls of cornstarch and one of sugar, rubbed smooth\r\nin a little milk, in a pint of boiling milk, and stirring in, just as it\r\nis taken from the stove, the well-beaten yolks of two eggs.\r\n\r\nPLAIN CORNSTARCH PUDDING.--Heat to boiling a pint and a half of\r\nmilk, with a few bits of the yellow rind of a lemon to flavor it. While\r\nthe milk is heating, rub four large spoonfuls of cornstarch to a cream\r\nwith half a cup of cold milk; beat well together the yolks of three\r\neggs, three tablespoonfuls of sugar, and half a cup of cold milk, and\r\nwhip the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth. When the milk is actively\r\nboiling, remove the bits of lemon rind with a skimmer, and stir in the\r\nstarch mixture; stir constantly and boil three or four minutes--until\r\nthe starch is well cooked; then add gradually, stirring well meanwhile,\r\nthe yolks and sugar. Remove from the fire, and stir the beaten whites\r\nlightly through the whole. Serve with a dressing of fruit juice or fruit\r\nsyrup; if in the season of fresh berries, the pudding may be dressed\r\nwith a few spoonfuls of mashed strawberries, raspberries, or currants.\r\n\r\nPLAIN CUSTARD.--Heat a pint of milk to boiling, and stir in a\r\ntablespoonful of cornstarch nabbed smooth in a little milk; let the milk\r\nand starch boil together till they thicken; then cool and add one\r\nwell-beaten egg and two tablespoonfuls of sugar. Cook in the oven in a\r\ndish set inside another filled with hot water, or in a double boiler.\r\nThe milk may be previously flavored with orange, lemon, or cocoanut.\r\n\r\nPRUNE PUDDING.--Heat two and one half cups of milk to boiling, then\r\nstir in gradually a heaping tablespoonful of cornstarch which has been\r\nrubbed smooth in a little cold milk; let this boil and thicken for a\r\nminute, then remove from the fire. When cool, add three well-beaten\r\neggs, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and a cupful of prunes which have\r\nbeen stewed, then drained of all juice, the stones removed, and the\r\nprunes chopped fine. Pour into a pudding dish and bake twenty minutes.\r\nServe with or without cream.\r\n\r\nPRIME WHIP.--Sift through a colander some stewed sweet California\r\nprunes which have been thoroughly drained from juice, and from which the\r\nstones have been removed. Beat the whites of three eggs to a stiff\r\nfroth, and add two cups of the sifted prunes; beat all together\r\nthoroughly; turn into a pudding dish, and brown in the oven fifteen\r\nminutes. Serve cold, with a little cream or custard for dressing. Almond\r\nsauce also makes an excellent dressing.\r\n\r\nRICE APPLE CUSTARD PUDDING.--Pare, and remove the cores without\r\ndividing from a sufficient number of apples to cover the bottom of a\r\ntwo-quart pudding dish. Fill the cavities of the apples with a little\r\ngrated lemon rind and sugar, and put them into the oven with a\r\ntablespoon of water on the bottom of the dish. Cover, and steam till the\r\napples are tender, but not fallen to pieces. Then pour over them a\r\ncustard made with two cups of boiled rice, a quart of milk, half a cup\r\nof sugar, and two eggs.\r\n\r\nRICE CUSTARD PUDDING.--Take one and one half cups of nicely steamed\r\nrice, four tablespoonfuls of sugar, and a pint of milk; heat to boiling\r\nin a saucepan. Then stir in very carefully the yolk of one egg and one\r\nwhole egg, previously well beaten together with a few spoonfuls of milk\r\nreserved for the purpose. Let the whole boil up till thickened, but not\r\nlonger, as the custard will whey and separate. When partly cool, flavor\r\nwith a little vanilla or lemon, turn into a glass dish, and meringue\r\nwith the white of the second egg beaten to a stiff froth. Cold steamed\r\nrice may be used by soaking it in hot milk until every grain is\r\nseparate.\r\n\r\nRICE SNOW.--Into a quart of milk heated to boiling, stir five\r\ntablespoonfuls of rice flour previously braided with a very little cold\r\nmilk; add one half cup of sugar. Let the whole boil up together till\r\nwell cooked and thickened; then remove from the stove, and stir in\r\nlightly the beaten whites of four eggs. Mold, and serve cold with foam\r\nsauce.\r\n\r\nRICE SNOW WITH JELLY.--Steam or bake a teacupful of best rice in\r\nmilk until the grains are tender. Pile it up on a dish roughly. When\r\ncool, lay over it squares of jelly. Beat the whites of two eggs and one\r\nthird of a cup of sugar to a stiff froth, and pile like snow over the\r\nrice. Serve with cream sauce.\r\n\r\nRICE WITH EGGS.--Steam rice as previously directed, and when\r\nsufficiently cooked, stir into half of it while hot, the yolks of one or\r\ntwo eggs well beaten with a little sugar. Into the other half, the\r\nwhites of the eggs, sweetened and beaten to a stiff froth, may be\r\nlightly stirred while the rice is still hot enough to set the eggs.\r\nServe with the yellow half in the bottom of the dish, and the white part\r\npiled on top covered with whipped cream flavored with lemon or vanilla.\r\n\r\nSNOW PUDDING.--Heat one half pint each of water and milk together,\r\nto boiling, stir into this a tablespoonful of cornstarch rubbed smooth\r\nin a little cold milk, and cook for five minutes. Cool partially and add\r\nthe whites of two well-beaten eggs. Turn into molds and set in the ice\r\nbox to cool. Serve with a cream made by stirring into a half pint of\r\nboiling milk the yolks of two eggs, a teaspoonful of cornstarch rubbed\r\nsmooth in a little cold milk, and half a cup of sugar. Cook until well\r\nthickened. Cool and flavor with a little lemon or vanilla. Or, if\r\npreferred, serve with a dressing of fruit juice.\r\n\r\nSTEAMED CUSTARD.--Heat a pint of milk, with which has been well\r\nbeaten two eggs and one third of a cup of sugar, in a double boiler\r\nuntil well thickened. When done, turn into a glass dish, and grate a\r\nlittle of the yellow rind of lemon over the top to flavor. If desired to\r\nhave the custard in cups, remove from the fire when it begins to\r\nthicken, turn into cups, and finish in a steamer over a kettle of\r\nboiling water.\r\n\r\nSTRAWBERRY CHARLOTTE.--Fit slices of nice plain buns (those made\r\naccording to recipe on page 347 are nice for this) in the bottom of a\r\npudding dish, and cover with a layer of hulled strawberries; add another\r\nlayer of the buns cut in slices, a second layer of strawberries, and\r\nthen more slices of buns. Make a custard in the following manner: Heat a\r\nscant pint of milk to boiling in the inner cup of a double boiler, and\r\nstir into it gradually, beating thoroughly at the same time, an egg\r\nwhich has been previously well beaten with half a cup of sugar, a\r\nteaspoonful of cornstarch, and a spoonful or two of milk until perfectly\r\nsmooth. Cook together in the double boiler until well set. Cool\r\npartially, and pour over the buns and strawberries. Place a plate with a\r\nweight upon it on the top of the charlotte, and set away to cool.\r\n\r\nPOP CORN PUDDING.--Take a scant pint of the pop corn which is\r\nground and put up in boxes, or if not available, freshly popped corn,\r\nrolled fine, is just as good. Add to it three cups of new milk, one half\r\ncup of sugar, two whole eggs and the yolk of another, well beaten. Bake\r\nin a pudding dish placed inside another filled with hot water, till the\r\ncustard is set. Cover with a meringue made of the remaining white of\r\negg, a teaspoonful of sugar, and a sprinkling of the pop corn.\r\n\r\nSAGO CUSTARD PUDDING.--Put one half cup of sago and a quart of rich\r\nmilk into the inner cup of a double boiler, or a basin set inside a pan\r\nof boiling water, and let it simmer until the sago has thickened the\r\nmilk and become perfectly transparent. Allow it to cool, then add a cup\r\nof sugar, two well-beaten eggs, and a little of the grated rind of a\r\nlemon. Turn into a pudding dish, and bake only till the custard has set.\r\n\r\nSAGO AND FRUIT CUSTARD PUDDING.--Soak six table spoonfuls of sago\r\nin just enough water to cover it, for twenty minutes. Meanwhile pare and\r\nremove the cores from half a dozen or more tart apples, and fill the\r\ncavities with a mixture of grated lemon rind and sugar. Place the apples\r\nin the bottom of a pudding dish, with a tablespoonful of water; cover,\r\nand set in the oven to bake. Put the soaked sago with a quart of milk\r\ninto a double boiler. Let it cook until the sago is clear and thick;\r\nthen add three fourths of a cup of sugar and two well-beaten eggs. Pour\r\nthe sago custard over the apples, which should be baked tender but not\r\nmushy. Put the pudding dish in the oven in a pan of hot water, and bake\r\ntill the custard is well set. Serve cold.\r\n\r\nSNOWBALL CUSTARD.--Flavor a pint of milk by sleeping in it three\r\nor four slices of the yellow rind of a lemon for twenty minutes or more.\r\nSkim out the rind; let the milk come to the boiling point, and drop into\r\nit the well-beaten whites of two eggs, in tablespoonfuls, turning each\r\none over carefully, allowing them to remain only long enough to become\r\ncoagulated but not hardened, and then place the balls upon a wire sieve\r\nto drain. Afterward stir into the scalding milk the yolks of the eggs\r\nand one whole one well beaten, together with two tablespoonfuls of\r\nsugar. Stir until it thickens. Pour this custard into a glass dish, and\r\nlay the white balls on top.\r\n\r\nTAPIOCA CUSTARD.--Soak a cup of pearl tapioca over night in\r\nsufficient water to cover. When ready to prepare the custard, drain off\r\nthe water if any remain, and add one quart of milk to the tapioca; place\r\nin a double boiler and cook until transparent; then add the well-beaten\r\nyolks of three eggs or the yolks of two and one whole one, mixed with\r\nthree fourths of a cup of sugar. Let it cook a few minutes, just long\r\nenough for the custard to thicken and no more, or it will whey and be\r\nspoiled; flavor with a little vanilla and turn into a glass dish. Cover\r\nthe top with the whites beaten stiffly with a tablespoonful of sugar,\r\nand dot with bits of jelly, or colored sugar prepared by mixing sugar\r\nwith cranberry or raspberry juice and allowing it to dry. For variety,\r\nthe custard may be flavored with grated lemon rind and a tablespoonful\r\nof lemon juice whipped up with the whites of the eggs, or other flavor\r\nmay be dispensed with, and the meringue flavored by beating with a\r\ntablespoonful of quince jelly with the whites of the eggs.\r\n\r\nTAPIOCA PUDDING.--Soak a cupful of tapioca over night in just\r\nenough water to cover. In the morning, add to it one quart of milk, and\r\ncook in a double boiler until transparent. Add three eggs well beaten,\r\none half cup of sugar, one half cup of chopped raisins, and a very\r\nlittle chopped citron. Bake till the custard is set. Serve warm or cold\r\nas preferred.\r\n\r\nVERMICELLI PUDDING.--Flavor two and one half cups of milk with\r\nlemon as directed on page 229. Drop into it, when boiling, four ounces\r\nof vermicelli, crushing it lightly with one hand while sprinkling it in,\r\nand stir to keep it from gathering in lumps. Let it cook gently in a\r\ndouble boiler, stirring often until it is tender and very thick. Then\r\npour it into a pudding dish, let it cool, and add a tablespoonful of\r\nrather thick sweet cream if you have it (it does very well without),\r\nhalf a cup of sugar, and lastly, two well-beaten eggs. Bake in a\r\nmoderately hot oven till browned over the top.\r\n\r\nWHITE CUSTARD.--Beat together thoroughly one cup of milk, the\r\nwhites of two eggs, one tablespoonful of sugar, and one and one half\r\ntablespoonfuls of almondine. Turn into cups and steam or bake until the\r\ncustard is set.\r\n\r\nWHITE CUSTARD NO. 2.--Cook a half cup of farina in a quart of milk\r\nin a double boiler, for an hour. Remove from the stove, and allow it to\r\nbecome partially cool, then add one half cup of sugar, the whites of two\r\neggs, and one half the yolk of one egg. Turn into a pudding dish, and\r\nbake twenty minutes or until the custard is well set.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEAMED PUDDING.\r\n\r\nThe following precautions are necessary to be observed in steaming\r\npuddings or desserts of any sort:--\r\n\r\n1. Have the water boiling rapidly when the pudding is placed in the\r\nsteamer, and keep it constantly boiling.\r\n\r\n2. Replenish, if needed, with boiling water, never with cold.\r\n\r\n3. Do not open the steamer and let in the air upon the pudding, until it\r\nis done.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nBATTER PUDDING.--Beat four eggs thoroughly; add to them a pint of\r\nmilk, and if desired, a little salt. Sift a teacupful of flour and add\r\nit gradually to the milk and eggs, beating lightly the while. Then pour\r\nthe whole mixture through, a fine wire strainer into a small pail with\r\ncover, in which it can be steamed. This straining is imperative. The\r\ncover of the pail should be tight fitting, as the steam getting into the\r\npudding spoils it. Place the pail in a kettle of boiling water, and do\r\nnot touch or move it until the pudding is done. It takes exactly an hour\r\nto cook. If moved or jarred during the cooking, it will be likely to\r\nfall. Slip it out of the pail on a hot dish, and serve with cream sauce.\r\nA double boiler with tightly fitting cover is excellent for cooking this\r\npudding.\r\n\r\nBREAD AND FRUIT CUSTARD.--Soak a cupful of finely grated bread\r\ncrumbs in a pint of rich milk heated to scalding. Add two thirds of a\r\ncup of sugar, and the grated yellow rind of half a lemon. When cool, add\r\ntwo eggs well beaten. Also two cups of canned apricots or peaches\r\ndrained of juice, or, if preferred, a mixture of one and one half cups\r\nof chopped apples, one half cup of raisins, and a little citron. Turn\r\ninto a pudding dish, and steam in a steamer over a kettle of boiling\r\nwater for two hours. The amount of sugar necessary will vary somewhat\r\naccording to the fruit used.\r\n\r\nDATE PUDDING.--Turn a cup of hot milk over two cups of stale bread\r\ncrumbs, and soak until softened; add one half cup of cream and one cup\r\nof chopped and stoned dates. Mix all thoroughly together. Put in a china\r\ndish and steam for three hours. Serve hot with lemon sauce.\r\n\r\nRICE BALLS.--Steam one cup of rice till tender. Wring pudding\r\ncloths about ten inches square out of hot water, and spread the rice one\r\nthird of an inch over the cloth. Put a stoned peach or apricot from\r\nwhich the skin has been removed, in the center, filling the cavity in\r\neach half of the fruit with rice. Draw up the cloth until the rice\r\nsmoothly envelops the fruit, tie, and steam ten or fifteen minutes.\r\nRemove the cloth carefully, turn out into saucers, and serve with sauce\r\nmade from peach of apricot juice. Easy-cooking tart apples may also be\r\nused. Steam them thirty minutes, and serve with sugar and cream.\r\n\r\nSTEAMED BREAD CUSTARD.--Cut stale bread in slices, removing hard\r\ncrusts. Oil a deep pudding mold, and sprinkle the bottom and sides with\r\nZante currants; over these place a layer of the slices of bread,\r\nsprinkled with currants; add several layers, sprinkling each with the\r\ncurrants in the same manner. Cover with a custard made by beating\r\ntogether three or four eggs, three tablespoonfuls of sugar, and one\r\nquart of milk. Put the pudding in a cool place for three hours; at the\r\nend of that time, steam one and a quarter hours. Serve with mock cream\r\nflavored with vanilla. Apple marmalade may be used to spread between the\r\nslices in place of currants, if preferred.\r\n\r\nSTEAMED FIG PUDDING.--Moisten two cupfuls of finely grated Graham\r\nbread crumbs with half a cup of thin sweet cream. Mix into it a heaping\r\ncupful of finely chopped fresh figs, and a quarter of a cup of sugar.\r\nAdd lastly a cup of sweet milk. Turn all into a pudding dish, and steam\r\nabout two and one half hours. Serve as soon as done, with a little cream\r\nfor dressing, or with orange or lemon sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\nPASTRY AND CAKE.\r\n\r\nSo much has been said and written about the dietetic evils of these\r\narticles that their very names have been almost synonymous with\r\nindigestion and dyspepsia. That they are prolific causes of this dire\r\nmalady cannot be denied, and it is doubtless due to two reasons; first,\r\nbecause they are generally compounded of ingredients which are in\r\nthemselves unwholesome, and rendered doubly so by their combination; and\r\nsecondly, because tastes have become so perverted that an excess of\r\nthese articles is consumed in preference to more simple and nutritious\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nAs has been elsewhere remarked, foods containing an excess of fat, as do\r\nmost pastries and many varieties of cake, are exceedingly difficult of\r\ndigestion, the fat undergoing in the stomach no changes which answer to\r\nthe digestion of other elements of food, and its presence interferes\r\nwith the action of the gastric juice upon other elements. In\r\nconsequence, digestion proceeds very slowly, if at all, and the delay\r\noften occasions fermentative and putrefactive changes in the entire\r\ncontents of the stomach.\r\n\r\nIt is the indigestibility of fat, and this property of delaying the\r\ndigestion of other foods, chiefly that render pastry and cakes so\r\ndeleterious to health.\r\n\r\nWe do not wish to be understood as in sympathy with that class of people\r\nwho maintain that dyspepsia is a disciplinary means of grace, when,\r\nafter having made the previous statement, we proceed to present recipes\r\nfor preparing the very articles we have condemned. Pie and cake are not\r\nnecessarily utterly unwholesome; and if prepared in a simple manner, may\r\nbe partaken of in moderation by persons with good digestion.\r\nNevertheless, they lack the wholesomeness of more simple foods, and we\r\nmost fully believe that would women supply their tables with perfectly\r\nlight, sweet, nutritious bread would cease. However, if pies and cakes\r\nmust needs be, make them as simple as possible.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SUGGESTIONS FOR MAKING PIES.--Always prepare the filling\r\nfor pies before making the crust, if the filling is to be cooked in the\r\ncrust. Have all the material for the crust on the table, measured and in\r\nreadiness, before beginning to put together. Follow some of the simple\r\nrecipes given in these pages. Have all the material cold, handle the\r\nleast possible to make it into a mass, and do not knead at all.\r\n\r\nWhen the crust is ready, roll it out quickly to about one half inch in\r\nthickness, then fold up like a jelly roll, and cut from the end only\r\nsufficient for one crust at a time. Lay this, the flat side upon the\r\nboard, and roll evenly in every direction, until scarcely more than an\r\neighth of an inch in thickness, and somewhat larger than the baking\r\nplate, as it will shrink when lifted from the board.\r\n\r\nTurn one edge over the rolling pin, and carefully lift it onto the\r\nplate. If there is to be an upper crust, roll that in the same manner,\r\nmake a cut in the center to allow the steam to escape, fill the pie,\r\nslightly rounding it in the center, and lift on the upper crust; press\r\nboth edges lightly together; then, lifting the pie in the left hand,\r\ndeftly trim away all overhanging portions of crust with a sharp knife;\r\nornament the edge if desired, and put at once into the oven, which\r\nshould be in readiness at just the right temperature, a rather moderate\r\noven being best for pies.\r\n\r\nThe under crust of lemon, pumpkin, custard, and very juicy fruit pies,\r\nfilled before baking, is apt to become saturated and softened with the\r\nliquid mixture, if kept for any length of time after baking. This may be\r\nprevented in a measure by glazing the crust, after it is rolled and\r\nfitted on the plate, with the beaten white of an egg, and placing in the\r\noven just a moment to harden the egg before filling; or if the pie is\r\none of fruit, sprinkle the crust with a little flour and sugar, brushing\r\nthe two together with the hand before; adding the filling. During the\r\nbaking, the flour and melted sugar will adhere together, tending to keep\r\nthe juice from contact with the crust.\r\n\r\nPies are more wholesome if the crusts are baked separately and filled\r\nfor use as needed. This is an especially satisfactory way to make pies\r\nof juicy fruit, as it does away largely with the saturated under crusts,\r\nand the flavor of the fruit can be retained much more perfectly. Pies\r\nwith one crust can be made by simply fitting the crust to the plate,\r\npricking it lightly with a fork to prevent its blistering while baking,\r\nand afterward filling when needed for the table. For pies with two\r\ncrusts, fit the under crust to the plate, and fill with clean pieces of\r\nold white linen laid in lightly to support the upper crust. When baked,\r\nslip the pie on a plate, lift off the upper crust, take out the pieces\r\nof cloth, and just before serving, fill with fruit, which should be\r\npreviously prepared.\r\n\r\nCanned peaches filled into such a crust make a delicious pie.\r\nStrawberries, cherries, gooseberries, and other juicy fruits, that lose\r\nso much of their flavor in baking, may be lightly scalded, the juice\r\nthickened a little with flour if desired, sweetened to taste, and filled\r\ninto such a crust. An excellent pie may be made in this manner from\r\napples, stewed carefully so as to keep the slices whole, sweetened to\r\ntaste, and flavored with lemon, orange, or grated pineapple. One\r\npineapple will be sufficient for four pies. Fresh fruit for filling may\r\nbe used without cooking, if desired. If desired, several crusts may be\r\nbaked and put away unfilled. When needed, the crusts may be placed for a\r\nfew minutes in a hot oven until heated through, then filled with freshly\r\nprepared fruit.\r\n\r\nIn preparing material for custard or pumpkin pies, if the milk used be\r\nhot, the pies will be improved and the time of baking be considerably\r\nshortened.\r\n\r\nTin or granite-ware plates are preferable to earthen ones for pies, as\r\nthey bake better on the bottom. The perforated pans are superior in some\r\nrespects. No greasing is needed; simply rub them well with flour. The\r\ntime required for baking pies varies from one half to three fourths of\r\nan hour. The dampers should be so adjusted as to bake the bottom crust\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nAfter baking, remove at once to heated earthen plates, or set the tins\r\nupon small supports, so that the air can circulate underneath them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nPASTE FOR PIES.--Sift together equal parts of Graham grits and\r\nwhite flour (Graham flour will do if the grits are not obtainable, but\r\nthe grits will produce a more crisp and tender crust), and wet with very\r\ncold, thin sweet cream. Have the flour also as cold as possible, since\r\nthe colder the material, the more crisp the paste; mix together very\r\nquickly into a rather stiff dough. Do not knead at all, but gather the\r\nfragments lightly together, roll out at once, fill and bake quickly,\r\nsince much of the lightness of the crust depends upon the dispatch with\r\nwhich the pie is gotten into the oven after the materials are thrown\r\ntogether. If for any reason it is necessary to defer the baking, place\r\nthe crust in the ice-chest till needed.\r\n\r\nCORN MEAL CRUST.--Equal parts of sifted white corn meal and flour,\r\nmixed together lightly with rather thin sweet cream which has been set\r\nin the ice-chest until very cold, makes a very good crust.\r\n\r\nGRANOLA CRUST.--For certain pies requiring an under crust only, the\r\nprepared granola manufactured by the Sanitarium Food Co. makes a\r\nsuperior crust. To prepare, moisten with thin sweet cream--one half cup\r\nof cream for every two thirds cup of granola is about the right\r\nproportion, and will make sufficient crust for one pie. Flour the board,\r\nand lift the moistened granola onto it, spreading it as much as possible\r\nwith the hands. Dredge lightly with flour over the top, and roll out\r\ngently to the required size without turning. The material, being coarse\r\nand granular, will break apart easily, but may be as easily pressed\r\ntogether with the fingers. Change the position of the rolling pin often,\r\nin order to shape the crust without moving it. When well roiled,\r\ncarefully slip a stiff paper under it, first loosening from the board\r\nwith a knife if necessary, and lift it gently onto the pan. Press\r\ntogether any cracks, trim the edges, fill, and bake at once. Use the\r\nleast flour possible in preparing this crust, and bake as soon as made,\r\nbefore the moisture has become absorbed. Such a crust is not suited for\r\ncustard or juicy fruit pies, but filled with prune, peach, or apple\r\nmarmalade, it makes a most delicious and wholesome pie. A cooked custard\r\nmay be used in such a crust.\r\n\r\nPASTE FOR TART SHELLS.--Take one half cup of rather thin sweet\r\ncream, which has been placed on ice until very cold; add to it the\r\nstiffly beaten whites of two eggs, and whip all together briskly for ten\r\nminutes. Add sufficient white flour to roll. Cut into the required\r\nshape, bake quickly, but do not brown. Fill after baking. This paste,\r\nrolled thin and cut into shapes with a cookie-cutter, one half of them\r\nbaked plain for under crusts, the other half ornamented for tops by\r\ncutting small holes with a thimble or some fancy mold, put together with\r\na layer of some simple fruit jelly between them, makes a most attractive\r\nlooking dessert. It is likewise very nice baked in little patty pans,\r\nand afterward filled with apple or peach marmalade, or any of the\r\nfollowing fillings:--\r\n\r\nCREAM FILLING.--One cup of rich milk (part cream if it can be\r\nafforded) heated to boiling. Into this stir one scant tablespoonful of\r\nflour previously braided smooth with a little cold milk. Add to this the\r\nwell-beaten yolk of one egg and one tablespoonful of sugar. Turn this\r\nmixture into the hot milk and stir until it thickens. Flavor with a\r\nlittle grated lemon rind, vanilla, or, if preferred, flavor the milk\r\nwith cocoanut before using. Fill the tart shells, and meringue with the\r\nwhite of the egg beaten stiff with a tablespoonful of sugar.\r\n\r\nGRAPE TART.--Into one pint of canned or fresh grape juice, when\r\nboiling, stir two tablespoonfuls of cornstarch braided with a little\r\nwater, and cook for five minutes. Sweeten to taste, and fill a baked\r\ncrust.\r\n\r\nLEMON FILLING.--Into one cup of boiling water stir one\r\ntablespoonful of cornstarch previously braided smooth with the juice of\r\na large lemon. Cook until it thickens, then add one half cup of sugar\r\nand a little grated yellow rind of the lemon.\r\n\r\nTAPIOCA FILLING.--Soak one tablespoonful of tapioca over night in\r\none cup of water; mash and stir the tapioca, simmer gently until clear\r\nand thick, adding enough water to cook it well; add half a cup of white\r\nsugar and a tablespoonful each of lemon and orange juice. If desired, a\r\nlittle raspberry or currant juice may be added to make the jelly of a\r\npink color.\r\n\r\nAPPLE CUSTARD PIE.--Stew good dried apples till perfectly tender\r\nand there remains but very little juice. Rub through a colander. For\r\neach pie use one cup of the sifted apples, one and a half cups of rich\r\nmilk, two eggs, five tablespoonfuls of sugar, and a little grated lemon\r\nrind for flavoring. Bake with under crust only. Stewed fresh apples,\r\nbeaten smooth or rubbed through a colander, can be used if preferred.\r\nThe eggs may be omitted, and one half cup more of the sifted apples,\r\nwith more sugar, may be used instead.\r\n\r\nBANANA PIE.--For each pie required prepare a custard with one and\r\none half cups of milk, the yolks of two eggs, and two heaping\r\ntablespoonfuls of sugar. Mash two large bananas through a colander,\r\nstrain the custard over them, and beat well together. Bake in an under\r\ncrust only, and meringue the top with the whites of the eggs beaten to a\r\nstiff froth with two tablespoonfuls of sugar.\r\n\r\nBREAD PIE.--Soak a slice of very light bread in a pint of rich\r\nmilk. When it is quite soft, rub through a colander and afterward beat\r\nwell through the milk. Add one well-beaten egg, four tablespoonfuls of\r\nsugar, and a little grated lemon rind for flavor. Bake with under crust\r\nonly, till the custard is set. This is sufficient for one pie.\r\n\r\nCARROT PIE.--Boil, drain, and rub the carrots through a colander.\r\nFor each pie required, use two large tablespoonfuls of carrot thus\r\nprepared, two eggs, two cups of milk, a little salt if desired, four\r\ntablespoonfuls of sugar, and lemon or vanilla for flavoring. Bake with\r\nunder crust only.\r\n\r\nCOCOANUT PIE.--Flavor a pint of milk with two tablespoonfuls of\r\ndesiccated, or finely grated fresh cocoanut according to directions on\r\npage 298; strain, and add enough fresh milk to make a pint in all. Add\r\nthree tablespoonfuls of sugar, heat, and as the milk comes to a boil,\r\nadd a tablespoonful of cornstarch rubbed smooth in a little cold milk.\r\nBoil for a minute or two till the cornstarch thickens the milk; then\r\nremove from the stove. Allow it to get cold, and then stir in one\r\nwell-beaten egg; bake in an under crust. Tie a tablespoonful of\r\ndesiccated cocoanut in a clean cloth, and pound it as fine as flour; mix\r\nit with a tablespoonful of sugar and the white of an egg beaten to a\r\nstiff froth. When the pie is done, spread this over the top, and brown\r\nin the oven for a moment only.\r\n\r\nCOCOANUT PIE NO. 2.--Steep one half cup of cocoanut in a pint of\r\nmilk for one half hour. Strain out the cocoanut and add sufficient fresh\r\nmilk to make a pint. Allow it to become cold, then add a quarter of a\r\ncup of sugar and two well-beaten eggs. Bake with an under crust only.\r\nWhen done, the top may be covered with a meringue the same as in the\r\npreceding recipe.\r\n\r\nCREAM PIE.--For one pie beat together one egg, one half cup of\r\nsugar, one tablespoonful of flour, and two cups of rich milk. Bake in\r\none crust.\r\n\r\nCRANBERRY PIE.--Stew a quart of cranberries until broken in a pint\r\nof boiling water. Rub through a colander to remove the skins, add two\r\ncups of sugar and one half cup of sifted flour. Bake with under crust\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nDRIED APPLE PIE.--Stew good dried apples till perfectly tender in\r\nas small a quantity of water as possible. When done, rub through a\r\ncolander; they should be about the consistency of fruit jam; if not, a\r\nlittle flour may be added. Sweeten to taste, fill under crusts with the\r\nmixture, and bake. If lemon flavor is liked, a few pieces of the yellow\r\nrind may be added to the apples a little while before they are tender.\r\nIf the apples are especially tasteless, lemon juice or some sour apple\r\njelly should be added after rubbing through the colander. The crusts may\r\nfirst be baked, and filled with the mixture when needed; in which case\r\nthe sauce should be simmered lightly till of the desired consistency.\r\nThe top may be ornamented with strips or rings of crust, if desired.\r\n\r\nDRIED APPLE PIE WITH RAISINS.--Rub a quart of well-stewed dried\r\napples through a colander, add a cupful of steamed raisins, sugar to\r\nsweeten, and bake with two crusts. This is sufficient for two pies.\r\n\r\nDRIED APRICOT PIE.--Stew together one third dried apricots and two\r\nthirds dried apples or peaches. When soft, rub through a colander, add\r\nsugar to sweeten, and if very juicy, stew again until the juice is\r\nmostly evaporated; then beat until light and bake in a granola crust.\r\n\r\nFARINA PIE.--Cook one fourth cup of farina in a double boiler for\r\nan hour in three cups of rich milk. Allow it to become cool, then add\r\none half cup of sugar, the yolks of two eggs, and a little grated lemon\r\nrind. Bake with under crust only. Meringue the top with the white of the\r\negg beaten to a stiff froth with one tablespoonful of sugar and a little\r\ngrated lemon rind for flavoring. The quantity given is sufficient for\r\ntwo small pies.\r\n\r\nFRUIT PIES.--Apples, peaches, and all small fruits and berries may\r\nbe made into palatable pies without rich crusts or an excess of sugar,\r\nor the addition of unwholesome spices and flavorings. Bake the crust\r\nseparately, and fill when needed with prepared fruit; or, fill with the\r\nfruit, using only sufficient sugar to sweeten; add no spices, and bake\r\nquickly. Prepare apples for pies by paring, coring, and dividing in\r\neighths. Peaches are best prepared in a similar manner. Fill crusts in\r\nwhich the fruit is to be baked quite full and slightly heaping in the\r\ncenter. If flavoring is desired, let it be that of some other fruit. For\r\napple pies, a teaspoonful or two of pineapple juice, a little grated\r\nlemon or orange peel, or a little strawberry or quince syrup, may be\r\nused for flavoring. For pies made of apples, peaches, and fruits which\r\nare not very juicy, add a tablespoonful or so of water or fruit juice;\r\nbut for very juicy fruits and berries, dredge the under crust with a\r\ntablespoonful of sugar and a little flour mixed together before filling,\r\nor stir a spoonful of flour into the fruit so that each berry or piece\r\nmay be separately floured.\r\n\r\nGRAPE JELLY PIE.--Cook perfectly ripe, purple grapes; rub them\r\nthrough a colander to remove the seeds and skins. Return the pulp to the\r\nfire and thicken with rice flour or cornstarch, to the consistency of\r\nthick cream or jelly, and sweeten to taste. Fill an under crust with the\r\nmixture, and bake. The top may be ornamented with pastry cut in fancy\r\nshapes if desired.\r\n\r\nJELLY CUSTARD PIE.--Dissolve three tablespoonfuls of nice, pure\r\nfruit jelly in very little warm water, add one and one half cups of milk\r\nand two well-beaten eggs, stirring the whites in last. Bake with under\r\ncrust only. Jellies are usually so sweet that no sugar is needed. Apple,\r\nraspberry, currant, strawberry, and quince jellies all make nice pies,\r\nprepared in this way.\r\n\r\nLEMON PIE.--Take four tablespoonfuls of lemon juice (one large\r\nlemon or two small ones will yield about this quantity), the grated\r\nyellow portion only of the rind of half a lemon, and two thirds of a cup\r\nof sugar. Beat the lemon juice and sugar together. Braid a slightly\r\nheaping tablespoonful of cornstarch with as little water as possible,\r\nand pour over it, stirring constantly, one half pint of boiling water,\r\nto thicken the starch. Add the lemon and sugar to the starch, and let it\r\ncool; then stir in the yolks of two eggs and half the white of one, well\r\nbeaten together. Beat thoroughly, pour into a deep crust, and bake. When\r\ndone, cover with the remaining whites of the eggs, beaten with one and a\r\nhalf tablespoonfuls of sugar, and brown lightly in the oven.\r\n\r\nLEMON MERINGUE CUSTARD.--Heat two cups of milk to boiling, add a\r\ntablespoonful of cornstarch well braided with a little cold milk; let\r\nthe whole simmer till thickened, stirring constantly. Allow it to cool,\r\nadd one third of a cup of sugar and the beaten yolks of two eggs. Bake\r\nin an under crust, and cover with a meringue made of the whites of the\r\neggs beaten to a stiff froth with two tablespoonfuls of sugar mixed\r\nwith grated lemon peel. If liked, a spoonful of lemon juice may be\r\nadded, a few drops at a time, during the beating of the meringue.\r\n\r\nONE-CRUST PEACH PIE.--Pare and remove the stones from ripe, nice\r\nflavored peaches; stew till soft in the smallest quantity of water\r\npossible without burning. Rub through a colander, or beat smooth with a\r\nlarge spoon. Add sugar as required. Bake with one crust. If the peach\r\nsauce is evaporated until quite dry, it is very nice baked in a granola\r\ncrust. When done, meringue with the whites of two eggs whipped stiff\r\nwith two tablespoonfuls of sugar. The flavor is improved by adding by\r\ndegrees to the egg while whipping, a tablespoonful of lemon juice.\r\nReturn to the oven and brown lightly. Serve cold.\r\n\r\nCanned peaches or stewed dried peaches may be used in place of the fresh\r\nones. In using the dried peaches, carefully examine and wash; soak them\r\nover night in cold water, and stew them in the same water until soft\r\nenough to rub through the colander. For each pie, add two tablespoonfuls\r\nof sweet cream, and sufficient sugar to sweeten; too much, sugar\r\ndestroys the flavor of the fruit. Evaporated peaches, soaked over night\r\nand stewed carefully until tender, then removed from the syrup, which\r\nmay be sweetened and boiled until thick and rich and afterward turned\r\nover the peaches, makes a delicious pie. Bake in one crust, with or\r\nwithout a meringue.\r\n\r\nORANGE PIE.--Rub smooth a heaping tablespoonful of cornstarch in\r\nthree tablespoonfuls of water; pour over it a cup of boiling water, and\r\ncook until clear, stirring frequently that no lumps form. Add one cupful\r\nof sour orange juice, a little grated rind, and the juice of one lemon,\r\nwith two eggs. Bake with under crust only. Meringue the top when baked,\r\nwith the whites of the eggs well beaten with a tablespoonful of sugar,\r\nand a very little grated orange peel sprinkled over it.\r\n\r\nPEACH CUSTARD PIE.--Cover a pie plate with an under crust. Take\r\nfresh peaches, pare, halve, and stone them, and place a layer, hollow\r\nside up, in the pie. Prepare a custard with one egg, one cup of milk,\r\nand three tablespoonfuls of sugar. Pour the custard over the peaches,\r\nand bake. If the quantity given will not entirely cover the peaches, a\r\nlittle more must be prepared. Canned peaches which are not broken can be\r\nused instead of fresh ones. The pieces should be drained free from\r\njuice, and less sugar used.\r\n\r\nPRUNE PIE.--Prepare and cook sweet California prunes as directed\r\nfor Prune Marmalade. Fill an under crust and bake. The top may be\r\nornamented with strips of crust or pastry leaves; or if desired, may be\r\nmeringued with the whites of two eggs beaten to a stiff froth with two\r\ntablespoonfuls of sugar and a little grated lemon peel. This pie is\r\nexcellent baked in a granola crust.\r\n\r\nPUMPKIN PIE.--To prepare the pumpkin, cut into halves, remove the\r\nseeds, divide into moderately small pieces, and bake in the oven until\r\nthoroughly done. Then scrape from the shell, rub through a colander, and\r\nproceed as follows: For one and one third pints of the cooked pumpkin\r\nuse one quart of hot, rich, sweet milk. Add one half cup of sugar and\r\nthe well-beaten yolks of three eggs, beat well together, add the whites\r\nof the eggs beaten to a stiff froth, and beat thoroughly. Line the tins\r\nwith a stiff cream paste, fill, and bake in a moderate oven till the\r\npies are barely firm in the center, or till the custard is well set.\r\n\r\nPUMPKIN PIE NO. 2.--For each pie desired, take one half pint of\r\nbaked pumpkin, a pint of rich milk, one third of a cup of sugar, and two\r\neggs. Mix the sugar and eggs, add the pumpkin, and lastly the milk,\r\nwhich should be hot, and beat all together with an egg beater until very\r\nlight. Fill the crust, and bake slowly.\r\n\r\nPUMPKIN PIE WITHOUT EGGS.--Prepare the pumpkin as previously\r\ndirected. For two medium-sized pies, heat a pint and a half of milk in a\r\nfarina kettle, and when scalding, stir into it two scant tablespoonfuls\r\nof white flour rubbed smooth in a little cold milk. Cook, stirring\r\noften, until it thickens. Add half a cup of sugar, or a little less of\r\nsyrup, to a pint and a half of the sifted pumpkin, and after beating\r\nwell together, stir this into the hot milk. Bake in an under crust; or,\r\nfor three pies, take one quart and a cupful of pumpkin, three fourths of\r\na cup of sugar, two thirds of a cup of best New Orleans molasses, and\r\nthree pints of hot milk. Beat all together thoroughly. Line deep plates\r\nwith a cream crust, and bake an hour and a half in a moderate oven.\r\n\r\nSIMPLE CUSTARD PIE.--For one pie, take one pint of milk, two\r\nwell-beaten eggs, one third of a cup of sugar, and a little grated lemon\r\nrind for flavor. Bake in an under crust. If eggs are scarce, a very good\r\npie can be made by using only one egg, and a tablespoonful of\r\ncornstarch, with the above proportions of milk and sugar; in which case,\r\nheat the milk to scalding, stir in the cornstarch, and cook till\r\nthickened; cool, and then add the well-beaten egg. If preferred, the\r\ncrust may be baked before filling, and the custard steamed, meanwhile.\r\n\r\nSQUASH PIE.--Squash prepared as directed for pumpkin, and flavored\r\nwith rose water, makes an excellent pie. Or, for each pie desired, take\r\none pint of rich milk (part cream if it can be afforded), add one cup of\r\nnicely baked mealy squash which has been rubbed through a colander, one\r\nthird of a cup of sugar, and two well-beaten eggs. Beat all together\r\nthoroughly. Bake in a deep pan slowly and carefully until firm.\r\n\r\nSQUASH PIE WITHOUT EGGS.--Bake the squash in the shell; when done,\r\nremove with a spoon and mash through a colander. For one pie, take eight\r\ntablespoonfuls of the squash, half a cup of sugar, and one and one third\r\ncups of boiling milk. Pour the milk slowly over the squash, beating\r\nrapidly meanwhile to make the mixture light. Bake in one crust.\r\n\r\nSWEET-APPLE CUSTARD PIE.--Into one pint of new milk, grate three\r\nripe sweet apples (Golden Sweets are excellent); add two well-beaten\r\neggs, and sugar to taste. Bake with under crust only.\r\n\r\nSWEET POTATO PIE.--Bake sufficient sweet potatoes to make a pint of\r\npulp when rubbed through a colander; add a pint of rich milk, a scant\r\ncup of sugar, salt if desired, the yolks of two eggs, and a little\r\ngrated lemon rind for flavor. Bake with under crust. When done, meringue\r\nwith the whites of the eggs beaten up with a tablespoonful of sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAKE.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SUGGESTIONS.--Always sift the flour for cake before\r\nmeasuring out the amount required. Use the best granulated white sugar.\r\nEggs for use in cake are better to have the yolks and whites beaten\r\nseparately. Beat the former until they cease to froth and begin to\r\nthicken as if mixed with flour. Beat the whites until stiff enough to\r\nremain in the bowl if inverted. Have the eggs and dishes cool, and if\r\npracticable, beat in a cool room. Use earthen or china bowls to beat\r\neggs in.\r\n\r\nIf fruit is to be used, it should be washed and dried according to\r\ndirections given on page 298, and then dusted with flour, a\r\ndessertspoonful to the pound of fruit. For use in cup cake or any other\r\ncake which requires a quick baking, raisins should be first steamed. If\r\nyou have no patent steamer, place them in a close covered dish within an\r\nordinary steamer, and cook for an hour over a kettle of boiling water.\r\nThis should be done the day before they are to be used.\r\n\r\nUse an earthen or granite-ware basin for mixing cake. Be very accurate\r\nin measuring the materials, and have them all at hand and all utensils\r\nready before beginning to put the cake together. If it is to be baked at\r\nonce, see that the oven also is at just the right temperature. It should\r\nbe less hot for cake than for bread. Thin cakes require a hotter oven\r\nthan those baked in loaves. They require from fifteen to twenty minutes\r\nto bake; thicker loaves, from thirty to sixty minutes. For loaf cakes\r\nthe oven should be at such a temperature that during the first half of\r\nthe time the cake will have risen to its full height and just begun to\r\nbrown.\r\n\r\nThe recipes given require neither baking powder, soda, nor saleratus.\r\nYeast and air can be made to supply the necessary lightness, and their\r\nuse admits of as great a variety in cakes as will be needed on a\r\nhygienic bill of fare.\r\n\r\nIn making cake with yeast, do not use very thick cream, as a rich, oily\r\nbatter retards fermentation and makes the cake slow in rising. If the\r\ncake browns too quickly, protect it by a covering of paper. If necessary\r\nto move a cake in the oven, do it very gently. Do not slam the oven door\r\nor in any way jar a cake while baking, lest it fall. Line cake tins with\r\npaper to prevent burning the bottom and edges. Oil the paper, not the\r\ntins, very lightly. Cake is done when it shrinks from the pan and stops\r\nhissing, or when a clean straw run into the thickest part comes up\r\nclean.\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible after baking, remove from the pan, as, if allowed to\r\nremain in the pan, it is apt to become too moist.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nAPPLE CAKE.--Scald a cup of thin cream and cool to blood heat, add\r\none and a half cups of sifted white flour, one fourth of a cup of sugar,\r\nand a gill of liquid yeast or one half cake of compressed yeast\r\ndissolved in a gill of thin cream. Beat well together, set in a warm\r\nplace, and let it rise till perfectly light. When well risen, add one\r\nhalf cup of sugar mixed with one half cup of warm flour. Beat well and\r\nset in a warm place to rise again. When risen a second time, add two\r\neggs, whites and yolks beaten separately, and about one tablespoonful of\r\nflour. Turn the whole into three round shallow baking tins, which have\r\nbeen previously oiled and warmed, and place where it will rise again for\r\nan hour, or until it is all of a foam. Bake quickly in a moderately hot\r\noven. Make this the day before it is needed, and when ready to use\r\nprepare a filling as follows: Beat together the whites of two eggs, one\r\nhalf cup of sugar, the juice of one lemon, and two large tart apples\r\nwell grated. Heat in a farina kettle until all are hot; cool, and\r\nspread between the layers of cake. This should be eaten the day the\r\nfilling is prepared.\r\n\r\nCOCOANUT CUSTARD CAKE.--Make the cake as directed in the preceding\r\nrecipe. For the filling, prepare a soft custard by heating just to the\r\nboiling point one pint of rich milk previously flavored with cocoanut;\r\ninto which stir A tablespoonful of cornstarch braided with a little\r\nmilk, and let it boil until thickened. Beat together an egg and one\r\nthird of a cup of sugar, and turn the hot mixture slowly over it,\r\nstirring constantly till the custard thickens. When cold, spread between\r\nthe layers of raised cake.\r\n\r\nCREAM CAKE.--Prepare the cake as above. Spread between the layers\r\nwhen cold a cream made as follows: Stir into one half pint of boiling\r\nmilk two teaspoonfuls of cornstarch rubbed smooth in a little cold milk.\r\nTake with two tablespoonfuls of sugar; return to the rest of the custard\r\nand cook, stirring constantly until quite thick. Cool and flavor with a\r\nteaspoonful of vanilla or rose water.\r\n\r\nDELICATE CUP CAKE.--This cake contains no soda or baking powder,\r\nand to make it light requires the incorporation of as much air as\r\npossible. In order to accomplish this, it should be put together in the\r\nsame manner as directed for Batter Breads (page 154). Have all material\r\nmeasured and everything in readiness before beginning to put the cake\r\ntogether, then beat together the yolk of one egg, one cup of sugar, and\r\none cup of very cold sweet cream, until all of a foam; add a little\r\ngrated lemon rind for flavoring; stir in slowly, beating briskly all the\r\ntime, two cups of granular white flour (sometimes termed gluten flour)\r\nor Graham meal. When all the flour is added, add lastly the beaten\r\nwhites of two eggs, stirring just enough to mix them well throughout the\r\nwhole; turn at once into slightly heated gem irons which have been\r\npreviously oiled, and bake in a moderately quick oven. If made according\r\nto directions, this cake will be very light and delicate. It will not\r\npuff up much above its first proportions, but will be light throughout.\r\n\r\nA nice cake may be prepared in the same manner with Graham meal or even\r\nwhite flour, by the addition of a heaping tablespoonful of cornstarch\r\nsifted into the flour, in the way in which baking powder is ordinarily\r\nmixed with flour before using.\r\n\r\nFIG LAYER CAKE.--Prepare the cake as directed for Apple Cake. Chop\r\none half pound of figs very fine, add one half cup of sugar, one cup of\r\nwater and boil in a farina kettle until soft and homogeneous. Cool, and\r\nspread between the cakes. Or chop steamed figs very fine, mix with an\r\nequal quantity of almondine, and use.\r\n\r\nFRUIT JELLY CAKE.--Prepare the cake as in the foregoing, using\r\nfruit jelly between the layers.\r\n\r\nGOLD AND SILVER CAKE.--Prepare the cake as for Apple Cake. When it\r\nhas risen the second time, measure out one third of it, and add the\r\nyolks of the eggs to that portion with a little grated lemon rind for\r\nflavoring; add the whites with some very finely pulverized desiccated\r\ncocoanut to the other two thirds. Make two sheets of the white and one\r\nof the yellow. Allow them to become perfectly light before baking. When\r\nbaked, place the yellow portion between the two white sheets, binding\r\nthem together with a little frosting or white currant jelly.\r\n\r\nICING FOR CAKES.--Since icing adds to the excess of sugar contained\r\nin cakes, it is preferable to use them without it except when especially\r\ndesired for ornament. An icing without eggs may be prepared by boiling a\r\ncup of granulated sugar in five tablespoonfuls of sweet milk for five\r\nminutes, then beating until cool enough to spread. One with egg may be\r\neasily made of six tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, the white of one\r\negg, and one teaspoonful of boiling water mixed without beating. A\r\ncolored icing may be made by using a teaspoonful of boiling cranberry\r\njuice or other red fruit juice instead of water. The top of the icing\r\nmay be ornamented with roasted almonds, bits of colored sugar or frosted\r\nfruits, directions for the preparation of all of which have already been\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nORANGE CAKE.--Prepare the cake as for Apple Cake, and bake in two\r\nlayers. For the filling, take two good-sized, juicy oranges. Flavor two\r\ntablespoonfuls of sugar by rubbing it over the skin of the oranges, then\r\npeel, remove the white rind, and cut into small pieces, discarding the\r\nseeds and the central pith. Put the orange pulp in a china bowl, and set\r\nin a dish of boiling water. When it is hot, stir in a heaping\r\nteaspoonful of cornstarch which has been braided smooth in two spoonfuls\r\nof water. Stir constantly until the starch has cooked, and the whole\r\nbecomes thickened. Beat the yolk of one egg to a cream with two\r\ntablespoonfuls of sugar. Stir this very gradually, so as not to lump,\r\ninto the orange mixture, and cook two or three minutes longer. Remove\r\nfrom the fire, and when cool, spread between the cakes. If the oranges\r\nare not very tart, a little lemon juice is an improvement. Meringue the\r\ntop of the cake with the white of the egg beaten up with the two\r\ntablespoonfuls of sugar flavored with orange.\r\n\r\nFRUIT CAKE.--Make a sponge of one pint of thin cream which has been\r\nscalded and cooled to lukewarm, one gill of liquid yeast or one half\r\ncake of compressed yeast dissolved in a gill of cream, one half cup of\r\nsugar, and two and one half cups of flour. Beat all together very\r\nthoroughly and let rise until light. When light, add another half cup of\r\nsugar, one half cup of rather thick cream which has been scalded and\r\ncooled, one cup of warm flour, and after beating well together, set away\r\nto rise again. When well risen, add one cup of seeded raisins, one\r\nfourth cup of citron chopped fine, one half cup of Zante currants, two\r\nwell-beaten eggs, and about one and one third cups of flour. Turn into a\r\nbrick loaf bread pan, let it rise until very light, and bake. When done,\r\nremove from the pan and set away until at least twenty-four hours old\r\nbefore using.\r\n\r\nLOAF CAKE.--Scald a cup of rather thin cream, and cool to blood\r\nheat. Add one and one half cups of warm flour, one half a cup of sugar,\r\nand one fourth cake of compressed yeast dissolved in two tablespoonfuls\r\nof thin cream or as much of liquid yeast. Beat well, and let rise until\r\nperfectly light; then add one half cup more of sugar mixed with one half\r\ncup of warm flour. Beat well, and set away to rise a second time. When\r\nagain well risen, add the whites of three eggs beaten to a stiff froth,\r\none half cup of warm flour, and a little grated lemon rind, or two\r\nteaspoonfuls of rose water to flavor. Turn into a brick loaf bread pan\r\nlined with oiled paper, allow it to become perfectly light again, and\r\nbake. This cake, like other articles made with yeast, should not be\r\neaten within at least twenty-four hours after baking.\r\n\r\nPINEAPPLE CAKE.--Prepare as for orange cake, using grated pineapple\r\nin place of oranges.\r\n\r\nPLAIN BUNS.--These are the simplest of all cakes. Dissolve half a\r\nsmall cake of compressed yeast in a cup of thin cream which has been\r\npreviously warmed to blood heat, add two cups of warm flour, and beat\r\nthoroughly together. Put in a warm place, and let it rise till very\r\nlight. Add three tablespoonfuls of sugar mixed well with a half cup of\r\nwarm flour, one half cup of Zante currants, and sufficient flour to make\r\nof the consistency of dough. Buns should be kneaded just as soft as\r\npossible, and from fifteen to twenty minutes. Shape into biscuits a\r\nlittle larger than an English walnut, place them on tins far enough\r\napart so they will not touch each other when risen. Put in a warm place\r\ntill they have risen to twice their first size, then bake in a\r\nmoderately quick oven. If desired, the currants may be omitted and a\r\nlittle grated lemon rind for flavoring added with the sugar, or a bit of\r\ncitron may be placed in the top of each bun when shaping. When taken\r\nfrom the oven, sprinkle the top of each with moist sugar if desired, or\r\nglace by brushing with milk while baking.\r\n\r\nSPONGE CAKE.--For this will be required four eggs, one cup of\r\nsugar, one tablespoonful of lemon juice with a little of the grated\r\nrind, and one cup of white flour. Success in the making of sponge cake\r\ndepends almost wholly upon the manner in which it is put together. Beat\r\nthe yolks of the eggs until very light and thick, then add the sugar\r\nlittle by little, beating it in thoroughly; add the lemon juice and the\r\ngrated rind. Beat the whites of the eggs until perfectly stiff and firm,\r\nand fold or chop them very lightly into the yolk mixture. Sift the flour\r\nwith a sifter little by little over the mixture and fold it carefully\r\nin. On no account stir either the white of the eggs or the flour in,\r\nsince stirring will drive out the air which has been beaten into the\r\neggs. Do not beat after the flour is added. The cake, when the flour is\r\nall in, should be stiff and spongy. If it is liquid in character, it\r\nwill be apt to be tough and may be considered a failure. Bake in a\r\nshallow pan in a rather hot oven fifteen or twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nSUGAR CRISPS.--Make a soft dough of two and one fourth cups of\r\nGraham flour, one half cup of granulated white sugar, and one cup of\r\nrather thick sweet cream. Knead as little as possible, roll out very\r\nthinly, cut in rounds or squares, and bake in a quick oven.\r\n\r\nVARIETY CAKE.--Make the same as Gold and Silver Cake, and mix a\r\nhalf cup of Zante currants and chopped raisins with the yellow portion.\r\nThe white portion may be flavored by adding a very little chopped citron\r\ninstead of the cocoanut, if preferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE TOPICS.\r\n\r\n    If families could be induced to substitute the apple--sound, ripe,\r\n    and luscious--for the pies, cakes, candies, and other sweetmeats\r\n    with which children are too often stuffed, there would be a\r\n    diminution of doctors' bills, sufficient in a single year to lay up\r\n    a stock of this delicious fruit for a season's use.--_Prof.\r\n    Faraday._\r\n\r\n    Food for repentance--mince pie eaten late at night.\r\n\r\n    _Young Student_--\"This cook book says that pie crust needs plenty of\r\n    shortening. Do you know what that means, pa?\"\r\n\r\n    _Father_--\"It means lard.\"\r\n\r\n    \"But why is lard called shortening, pa?\"\r\n\r\n    \"Because it shortens life.\"\r\n\r\n    The health journals and the doctors all agree that the best and most\r\n    wholesome part of the New England country doughnut is the hole. The\r\n    larger the hole, they say, the better the doughnut.\r\n\r\n    An old gentleman who was in the habit of eating a liberal slice of\r\n    pie or cake just before retiring, came home late one evening after\r\n    his wife had gone to bed. After an unsuccessful search in the\r\n    pantry, he called to his wife, \"Mary, where is the pie?\" His good\r\n    wife timidly acknowledged that there was no pie in the house. Said\r\n    her husband, \"Then where is the cake?\" The poor woman meekly\r\n    confessed that the supply of cake was also exhausted; at which the\r\n    disappointed husband cried out in a sharp, censorious tone, \"Why,\r\n    what would you do if somebody should be sick in the night?\"\r\n\r\n    _Woman_ (to tramp)--\"I can give you some cold buckwheat cakes and a\r\n    piece of mince pie.\" _Tramp_--(frightened) \"What ye say?\"\r\n    _Woman_--\"Cold buckwheat cakes and mince pie.\" _Tramp_--(heroically)\r\n    \"Throw in a small bottle of pepsin, Madam, and I'll take the\r\n    chances.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAVIES AND SAUCES\r\n\r\nGravies for vegetables, sauces for desserts, and similar foods thickened\r\nwith flour or cornstarch, are among the most common of the poorly\r\nprepared articles of the _cuisine_, although their proper preparation is\r\na matter of considerable importance, since neither a thin, watery sauce\r\nnor a stiff, paste-like mixture is at all palatable. The preparation of\r\ngravies and sauces is a very simple matter when governed by that\r\naccuracy of measurement and carefulness of detail which should be\r\nexercised in the preparation of all foods. In consistency, a properly\r\nmade sauce should mask the back of the spoon; that is to say, when\r\ndipped into the mixture and lifted out, the metal of the spoon should\r\nnot be visible through it as it runs off. The proportion of material\r\nnecessary to secure this requisite is one tablespoonful of flour,\r\nslightly rounded, for each half pint of water or stock. If the sauce be\r\nmade of milk or fruit juice, a little less flour will be needed. If\r\ncornstarch be used, a scant instead of a full tablespoonful will be\r\nrequired. The flour, or cornstarch should be first braided or rubbed\r\nperfectly smooth in a very small amount of the liquid reserved for the\r\npurpose (salt or sugar, if any is to be used, being added to the flour\r\nbefore braiding with the liquid), and then carefully added to the\r\nremaining liquid, which should be actively boiling. It should then be\r\ncontinuously stirred until it has thickened, when it should be allowed\r\nto cook slowly for five or ten minutes until the starch or flour is well\r\ndone. If through any negligence to observe carefully these simple\r\ndetails, there should be lumps in the sauce, they must be removed before\r\nserving by turning the whole through a fine colander or wire strainer.\r\n\r\nThe double boiler is the best utensil for the preparation of sauces and\r\ngravies, since it facilitates even cooking and renders them less liable\r\nto become scorched. The inner cup should be placed on the top of the\r\nrange until the sauce has become thickened, as in the cooking of grains,\r\nand afterwards placed in the outer boiler to continue the cooking as\r\nlong as needed.\r\n\r\nCream gravies for vegetables may be delicately flavored with celery, by\r\nsteeping a few bits of celery in the milk for a few minutes, and\r\nremoving with a fork before adding the thickening. Sauces for puddings\r\nmay be similarly flavored, by steeping cocoanut or bits of orange or\r\nlemon rind in the milk.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAVIES AND SAUCES FOR VEGETABLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nBROWN SAUCE.--Heat a pint of thin cream, and when boiling, add half\r\na teaspoonful of salt and a tablespoonful of flour browned in the oven\r\nas directed on page 274, and rubbed to a smooth paste with a little cold\r\nmilk. Allow it to boil rapidly, stirring constantly until thickened;\r\nthen cook more slowly, in a double boiler, for five or ten minutes. If\r\ndesired, the milk may be flavored with onion before adding the flour.\r\nThis makes a good dressing for potatoes.\r\n\r\nCREAM OR WHITE SAUCE.--Heat a pint of rich milk, part cream if it\r\ncan be afforded, to boiling, and stir into it one tablespoonful of flour\r\npreviously rubbed smooth in a little milk. Season with salt, and cook in\r\na double boiler five or ten minutes, stirring frequently that no lumps\r\nbe formed. If lumps are found in the sauce, turn it quickly through a\r\nfine, hot colander into the dish in which it is to be served.\r\n\r\nCELERY SAUCE.--Cut half a dozen stalks of celery into\r\nfinger-lengths, and simmer in milk for ten or fifteen minutes. Skim out\r\nthe celery, add a little cream to the milk, salt to taste, and thicken\r\nwith flour as for white sauce. This is very nice for potatoes and for\r\ntoast.\r\n\r\nEGG SAUCE.--Heat a pint of milk to boiling, and stir in a\r\ndessertspoonful of flour rubbed smooth in a little milk. Stir constantly\r\nuntil the sauce is well thickened; add the well-beaten yolk of an egg,\r\nturning it in very slowly and stirring rapidly so that it shall be well\r\nmingled. Boil up once only, add a very little salt, and serve. The egg\r\nmakes an excellent substitute for cream.\r\n\r\nPEASE GRAVY.--A gravy prepared either of dried or green peas as\r\ndirected for Lentil Gravy on page 226, makes a suitable dressing for\r\nbaked potatoes. Lentil gravy is also good for the same purpose. The\r\naddition of a little lemon juice to the lentil gravy makes another\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nTOMATO GRAVY.--A gravy made of tomatoes as directed on page 261, is\r\nexcellent to use on baked or boiled sweet potatoes.\r\n\r\nTOMATO CREAM GRAVY.--Prepare a gravy as for Cream Sauce, using a\r\nslightly heaping measure of flour. When done, add, just before serving,\r\nfor each quart of the cream sauce, one cup of hot, stewed tomato which\r\nhas been put through a fine colander to remove all seeds. Beat it\r\nthoroughly into the sauce and serve on boiled or baked potato.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAUCES FOR DESSERTS AND PUDDINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nALMOND SAUCE.--Heat a pint of rich milk in the inner cup of a\r\ndouble boiler, placed directly upon the stove. When the milk is boiling,\r\nstir into it a heaping tablespoonful of flour which has been rubbed to a\r\ncream in a little cold milk. Boil rapidly until thickened, stirring\r\nconstantly; then add three tablespoonfuls of almondine; place in the\r\nouter boiler, and cook for five or ten minutes longer.\r\n\r\nCARAMEL SAUCE.--Stir a cup of sugar in a saucepan over the fire\r\nuntil melted and lightly browned. Add one cup of boiling water, and\r\nsimmer ten minutes.\r\n\r\nCOCOANUT SAUCE.--Flavor a pint of new milk with cocoanut, as\r\ndirected on page 298. Skim out the cocoanut, and add enough fresh milk\r\nto make one pint. Heat the milk to boiling, add two tablespoonfuls of\r\nsugar, thicken with two even spoonfuls of cornstarch, and proceed in the\r\nsame manner as for Mock Cream.\r\n\r\nCREAM SAUCE.--Beat together two thirds of a cup of sugar, one\r\ntablespoonful of thick, sweet cream, and one egg. Wet half a teaspoonful\r\nof cornstarch with a little milk, and stir in with the mixture; then\r\nadd five tablespoonfuls of boiling milk, stirring rapidly all the time.\r\nPour into the inner cup of a double boiler; have the water in the outer\r\ncup boiling, and cook five minutes. Flavor to taste.\r\n\r\nCRANBERRY PUDDING SAUCE.--To a quart of boiling water add two cups\r\nof sugar, and when well dissolved, one quart of carefully sorted\r\ncranberries. Mash the berries as much as possible with a silver spoon,\r\nand boil just seven minutes. Turn through a colander to remove skins,\r\ncool and serve.\r\n\r\nCUSTARD SAUCE.--Rub two teaspoonfuls of flour to a smooth paste\r\nwith half a cup of new milk. Heat two and a half cups of fresh milk in a\r\ndouble boiler to scalding, then stir in the braided flour; heat again,\r\nstirring constantly till just to the boiling point, but no longer;\r\nremove from the stove and cool a little. Beat together one egg, three\r\ntablespoonfuls of sugar, and a little lemon rind for flavoring. Turn the\r\nhot milk over this, a little at a time, stirring briskly meanwhile.\r\nReturn the whole to the double boiler, and cook, stirring frequently,\r\nuntil when a spoon is dipped into the custard a coating remains upon it.\r\nThen remove at once from the fire. If the spoon comes out clean, the\r\ncustard is not sufficiently cooked.\r\n\r\nEGG SAUCE.--Separate the yolks and whites of three eggs. Beat the\r\nwhites to a stiff froth, and stir in very gently, so as not to let the\r\nair out of the beaten whites, one cup of powdered sugar and a\r\nteaspoonful of vanilla or lemon flavoring powder. Lastly, stir in\r\ncarefully the beaten yolks of the eggs, and serve at once.\r\n\r\nEGG SAUCE NO. 2.--Beat the whites of three eggs to a stiff froth\r\nwith one half cup of sugar. Add three tablespoonfuls of lemon juice and\r\none of water. Serve at once.\r\n\r\nFOAMY SAUCE.--Beat one egg or the whites of two very thoroughly\r\nwith one half cup of sugar and a little grated lemon rind. Pour on this\r\nvery slowly, stirring constantly to make it smooth, one cup of boiling\r\nmilk, part cream if it can be afforded. If the whites alone are used,\r\nthey should not be beaten stiff. If preferred, the lemon may be omitted\r\nand a tablespoonful or two of currant juice or quince jelly added last\r\nas flavoring.\r\n\r\nFRUIT CREAM.--Take the juice pressed from a cupful of fresh\r\nstrawberries, red raspberries, or black caps, add to it one third of a\r\ncup of sugar, and place in the ice chest till chilled. Set a cup of\r\nsweet cream also on ice till very cold. When thoroughly cold, whip with\r\nan egg beater till the froth begins to rise, then add to it the cold\r\nfruit juice and beat again. Have ready the white of one egg beaten to a\r\nstiff froth, which add to the fruit cream, and whip till no more froth\r\nwill rise. This makes a delicious dressing for simple grain molds and\r\nblancmanges, but is so rich it should be used rather sparingly. Serve as\r\nsoon as possible after being prepared. Fruit syrup, in the proportion of\r\ntwo or three tablespoonfuls to the pint of cream, may be used in the\r\nsame manner when the fresh juice is not available. The juice of orange,\r\nquince, and pineapple may also be used in the same manner as that of\r\nberries.\r\n\r\nFRUIT SAUCE.--Heat a pint of red raspberry, currant, grape,\r\nstrawberry, apricot, or any other fruit juice to scalding, and stir in a\r\ntablespoonful of cornstarch previously rubbed to a cream with a little\r\ncold water. Cook till it thickens; then add sugar according to the\r\nacidity of the fruit. Strain and cool before using. If fruit juice is\r\nnot available, two or three tablespoonfuls of pure fruit jelly may be\r\ndissolved in a pint of hot water and used instead of the juice. A\r\nmixture of red and black raspberry juice, or currant and raspberry, will\r\nbe found acceptable for variety.\r\n\r\nFRUIT SAUCE NO. 2.--Mash a quart of fresh berries, add one cup of\r\nsugar, beat very thoroughly together, and set away until needed. Just\r\nbefore it is wanted for serving, turn into a granite fruit kettle and\r\nheat nearly to boiling, stirring constantly to avoid burning. Serve hot\r\nwith hot or cold puddings, or molded desserts.\r\n\r\nLEMON PUDDING SAUCE.--Heat to boiling, in a double boiler, a pint\r\nof water in which are two slices of lemon, and stir into it a\r\ndessertspoonful of cornstarch; cook four to five minutes, or until it\r\nthickens. Squeeze the juice from one large lemon, and mix it with two\r\nthirds of a cup of sugar. Add this to the cornstarch mixture, and allow\r\nthe whole to boil up once, stirring constantly; then take from the fire.\r\nLeave in the double boiler, surrounded by the hot water, for ten\r\nminutes. Cool to blood heat before serving.\r\n\r\nMOCK CREAM.--Heat a pint of fresh, unskimmed milk in a double\r\nboiler. When the milk is boiling, stir in two tablespoonfuls of sugar,\r\nand two even tablespoonfuls of cornstarch which has first been rubbed\r\nsmooth in a very little cold milk. Bring just to a boil, stirring\r\nconstantly; then pour the hot mixture, a little at a time, beating\r\nthoroughly all the while, over the well-beaten white of one egg. Put\r\nagain into the double boiler, return to the fire, and stir till it\r\nthickens to the consistency of cream.\r\n\r\nMOLASSES SAUCE.--To one half cup of molasses, add one half cup of\r\nwater, and heat to boiling. Thicken with a teaspoonful of flour rubbed\r\nto a cream with a little cold water. Serve hot.\r\n\r\nORANGE SAUCE.--Squeeze a cupful of juice from well-flavored, sour\r\noranges. Heat a pint of water, and when boiling, thicken with a\r\ntablespoonful of cornstarch. Add the orange juice, strain, and sweeten\r\nto taste with sugar that has been flavored by rubbing over the yellow\r\nrind of an orange until mixed with the oil in the rind. If a richer\r\nsauce is desired, the yolk of an egg may be added lastly, and the sauce\r\nallowed to cook until thickened.\r\n\r\nPEACH SAUCE.--Strain the juice from a well-kept can of peaches.\r\nDilute with one half as much water, heat to boiling, and thicken with\r\ncornstarch, a scant tablespoonful to the pint of liquid.\r\n\r\nPLAIN PUDDING SAUCE.--Thicken one and one half cups of water with\r\none tablespoonful of cornstarch; boil a few minutes, then stir in two\r\nthirds of a cup of sugar, and one half cup of sweet cream. Take off the\r\nstove, and flavor with a little rose, vanilla, or lemon.\r\n\r\nRED SAUCE.--Pare and slice a large red beet, and simmer gently in\r\nthree cups of water for twenty minutes, or until the water is rose\r\ncolored, then add two cups of sugar, the thin yellow rind and juice of\r\none lemon, and boil until the whole is thick syrup. Strain, add a\r\nteaspoonful of rose water or vanilla, and serve.\r\n\r\nROSE CREAM.--Remove the thick cream from the top of a pan of cold\r\nmilk, taking care not to take up any of the milk. Add sugar to sweeten\r\nand a teaspoonful or two of rose water. Beat with an egg beater until\r\nthe whole mass is thick. Good thick cream, beaten in this manner, makes\r\nnearly double its original quantity.\r\n\r\nSAGO SAUCE.--Wash one tablespoonful of sago in two or three waters,\r\nthen put it into a saucepan with three fourths of a cup of hot water,\r\nand some bits of lemon peel. Simmer gently for ten minutes, take out the\r\nlemon peel, add half a cup of quince or apricot juice; and if the\r\nlatter, the strained juice of half a lemon, and sugar to taste. Beat\r\ntogether thoroughly.\r\n\r\nWHIPPED CREAM SAUCE.--Beat together with an egg beater until of a\r\nstiff froth one cup of sweet cream which has been cooled to a\r\ntemperature of 64° or less, one teaspoonful of vanilla or a little\r\ngrated lemon rind, and one half cup of powdered white sugar, and the\r\nwhites of one or two eggs. The sauce may be variously flavored with a\r\nlittle fruit jelly beaten with the egg, before adding to the cream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE TOPICS.\r\n\r\n    Whether or not life is worth living, all depends upon the\r\n    liver.--_Sel._\r\n\r\n    Diet cures mair than doctors.--_Scotch Proverb._\r\n\r\n    According to the ancient Hindu Scriptures, the proper amount of food\r\n    is half of what can be conveniently eaten.\r\n\r\n    Every hour you steal from digestion will be reclaimed by\r\n    indigestion.--_Oswald._\r\n\r\n    \"Very few nations in the world,\" says a sagacious historian,\r\n    \"produce better soldiers than the Russians. They will endure the\r\n    greatest fatigues and sufferings with patience and calmness. And it\r\n    is well know that the Russian soldiers are from childhood nourished\r\n    by simple and coarse vegetable food. The Russian Grenadiers are the\r\n    finest body of men I ever saw,--not a man is under six feet high.\r\n    Their allowance consists of eight pounds of black bread, and four\r\n    pounds of oil per man for eight days.\"\r\n\r\n    Colonel Fitzgibbon was, many years ago, colonial agent at London for\r\n    the Canadian Government, and wholly dependent upon remittances from\r\n    Canada for his support. On one occasion these remittances failed to\r\n    arrive, and it being before the day of cables, he was obliged to\r\n    write to his friends to ascertain the reason of the delay. Meanwhile\r\n    he had just one sovereign to live upon. He found he could live upon\r\n    a sixpence a day,--four pennyworth of bread, one pennyworth of milk,\r\n    and one pennyworth of sugar. When his remittances arrived a month\r\n    afterward, he had five shillings remaining of his sovereign, and he\r\n    liked his frugal diet so well that he kept it up for several years.\r\n\r\n    An hour of exercise to every pound of food.--_Oswald._\r\n\r\n     Some eat to live, they loudly cry;\r\n     But from the pace they swallow pie\r\n     And other food promiscuously,\r\n     One would infer they eat to die.\r\n\r\n    --_Sel._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEVERAGES\r\n\r\nThe use of beverages in quantities with food at mealtime is prejudicial\r\nto digestion, because they delay the action of the gastric juice upon\r\nsolid foods. The practice of washing down food by copious draughts of\r\nwater, tea, or coffee is detrimental, not only because it introduces\r\nlarge quantities of fluid into the stomach, which must be absorbed\r\nbefore digestion can begin, but also because it offers temptation to\r\ncareless and imperfect mastication, while tea and coffee also serve as a\r\nvehicle for an excessive use of sugar, thus becoming a potent cause of\r\nindigestion and dyspepsia. It is best to drink but sparingly, if at all,\r\nat mealtimes. Consideration should also be given to the nature of the\r\nbeverage, since many in common use are far from wholesome. Very cold\r\nfluids, like iced water, iced tea, and iced milk, are harmful, because\r\nthey cool the contents of the stomach to a degree at which digestion is\r\nchecked. If drunk at all, they should be taken only in small sips and\r\nretained in the mouth until partly warmed.\r\n\r\nTea is often spoken of as the \"cup that cheers but not inebriates.\"\r\n\"The cup that may cheer yet does injury\" would be nearer the truth, for\r\nthere is every evidence to prove that this common beverage is\r\nexceedingly harmful, and that the evils of its excessive use are second\r\nonly to those of tobacco and alcohol. Tea contains two harmful\r\nsubstances, theine and tannin,--from three to six per cent of the former\r\nand more than one fourth its weight of the latter. Theine is a poison\r\nbelonging to the same class of poisonous alkaloids, and is closely\r\nallied to cocaine. It is a much more powerful poison than alcohol,\r\nproducing death in less than one hundredth part the deadly dose of\r\nalcohol; and when taken in any but the smallest doses, it produces all\r\nthe symptoms of intoxication. Tannin is an astringent exercising a\r\npowerful effect in delaying salivary and stomach digestion, thus\r\nbecoming one of the most common causes of digestive disorders. It is\r\nalso a matter of frequent observation that sleeplessness, palpitation of\r\nthe heart, and various disorders of the nervous system frequently follow\r\nthe prolonged use of tea. Both theine and tannin are more abundant in\r\ngreen than in black tea.\r\n\r\nThe dependence of the habitual tea-drinker upon the beverage, and the\r\nsense of loss experienced when deprived of it, are among the strongest\r\nproofs of its evil effects, and should be warnings against its use. No\r\nsuch physical discomfort is experienced when deprived of any article of\r\nordinary food. The use of tea makes one feel bright and fresh when\r\nreally exhausted; but, like all other stimulants, it is by exciting\r\nvital action above the normal without supplying extra force to support\r\nthe extra expenditure. The fact that a person feels tired is evidence\r\nthat the system demands rest, that his body is worn and needs repair;\r\nbut the relief experienced after a cup of tea is not recuperation.\r\nInstead, it indicates that his nerves are paralyzed so that they are\r\ninsensible to fatigue.\r\n\r\nSome people suppose the manner of preparing tea has much to do with its\r\ndeleterious effects, and that by infusion for two or three minutes only,\r\nthe evils resulting from the tannin will be greatly lessened. This,\r\nhowever, is a delusion, if the same amount of tea be used proportionate\r\nto the water; for tannin in its free state, the condition in which it is\r\nfound in tea is one of the most readily soluble of substances; and tea\r\ninfused for two minutes is likely to hold nearly as much tannin in\r\nsolution as that infused for a longer period.\r\n\r\nTea is not a food, and it can in no wise take the place of food, as so\r\nmany people attempt to make it, without detriment to health in every\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nCoffee, cocoa, and chocolate rank in the same category with tea, as\r\nbeverages which are more or less harmful. Coffee contains caffein, a\r\nprinciple identical with theine and a modified form of tannin, though in\r\nless quantity than tea. Cocoa and chocolate contain substances similar\r\nto theine and equally harmful, though usually present in much less\r\nproportion than in tea.\r\n\r\nCustom has made the use of these beverages so common that most people\r\nseldom stop to inquire into their nature. Doubtless the question arises\r\nin many minds; If these beverages contain such poisons, why do they not\r\nmore commonly produce fatal results?--Because a tolerance of the poison\r\nis established in the system by use, as in the case of tobacco and other\r\nnarcotics and stimulants; but that the poisons surely though insidiously\r\nare doing their work is attested by the prevalence of numerous disorders\r\nof the digestive and nervous systems, directly attributable to the use\r\nof these beverages.\r\n\r\nBoth tea and coffee are largely adulterated with other harmful\r\nsubstances, thus adding another reason why their use should be\r\ndiscarded. It is stated on good authority that it is almost impossible\r\nto obtain unadulterated ground coffee.\r\n\r\nIn view of all these facts, it certainly seems wisest if a beverage is\r\nconsidered essential, to make use of one less harmful. Hot milk, hot\r\nwater, hot lemonade, caramel coffee, or some of the various grain\r\ncoffees, recipes for which are give in the following pages, are all\r\nexcellent substitutes for tea and coffee, if a hot drink is desired.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES_\r\n\r\nBEET COFFEE.--Wash best beets thoroughly, but do not scrape; slice,\r\nand brown in a moderate oven, taking care not to burn. When brown, break\r\nin small pieces and steep the same as ordinary coffee.\r\n\r\nCARAMEL COFFEE.--Take three quarts best bran, one quart corn meal,\r\nthree tablespoonfuls of molasses; mix and brown in the oven like\r\nordinary coffee. For every cup of coffee required, use one heaping\r\ntablespoonful of the caramel. Pour boiling water over it, and steep, not\r\nboil, for fifteen or twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nCARAMEL COFFEE NO. 2.--Take one cup each of white flour, corn meal,\r\nunsifted Graham flour, and molasses. Mix well, and form into cakes half\r\nan inch thick and a little larger around than a silver dollar. If the\r\nmolasses is not thin enough to take up all the dry material, one fourth\r\nor one half a cup of cold water may be added for that purpose. Bake the\r\ncakes in the oven until very dark brown, allowing them to become\r\nslightly scorched. When desired for use, take one cake for each cup of\r\ncoffee required, pour sufficient water over them, and steep, not boil,\r\ntwenty minutes.\r\n\r\nCARAMEL COFFEE NO. 3.--To three and one half quarts of bran and one\r\nand one half quarts of corn meal, take one pint of New Orleans molasses\r\nand one half pint of boiling water. Put the water and molasses together\r\nand pour them over the bran and corn meal which have been previously\r\nmixed. Rub all well together, and brown slowly in the oven, stirring\r\noften, until a rich dark brown. Use one heaping tablespoonful of coffee\r\nto each small cup of boiling water, let it just boil up, then steep on\r\nthe back of the stove for five or ten minutes.\r\n\r\nCARAMEL COFFEE NO. 4.--Beat together four eggs and one pint of\r\nmolasses, and mix thoroughly with four quarts of good wheat bran. Brown\r\nin the oven, stirring frequently. Prepare for use the same as the\r\npreceding.\r\n\r\nMRS. T'S CARAMEL COFFEE.--Make a rather thick batter of Graham\r\ngrits or Graham meal and milk, spread it in shallow pans and bake in a\r\nmoderate oven until evenly done throughout. Cut the cake thus prepared\r\ninto thin strips, which break into small uniform pieces and spread on\r\nperforated tins or sheets and brown in the oven. Each piece should be\r\nvery darkly and evenly browned, but not burned. For each cup of coffee\r\nrequired, steep a small handful in boiling water for ten or fifteen\r\nminutes, strain and serve.\r\n\r\nPARCHED GRAIN COFFEE.--Brown in the oven some perfectly sound\r\nwheat, sweet corn, barley, or rice, as you would the coffee berry. If\r\ndesired, a mixture of grains may be used. Pound or grind fine. Mix the\r\nwhite of an egg with three tablespoonfuls of the ground grain, and pour\r\nover it a quart of boiling water. Allow it to come just to the boiling\r\npoint, steep slowly for twelve or fifteen minutes, and serve.\r\n\r\nWHEAT, OATS AND BARLEY COFFEE.--Mix together equal quantities of\r\nthese grains, brown in the oven like ordinary coffee, and grind. To one\r\nquart of boiling water take three tablespoonfuls of the prepared coffee\r\nmixed with the white of an egg, and steep in boiling water ten or\r\nfifteen minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES FOR COLD BEVERAGES._\r\n\r\nBLACKBERRY BEVERAGE.--Crush a quart of fresh blackberries, and pour\r\nover them a quart of cold water; add a slice of lemon and a teaspoonful\r\nof orange water, and let it stand three or four hours. Strain through a\r\njelly bag. Sweeten to taste with a syrup prepared by dissolving white\r\nsugar in hot water, allowing it to become cold before using. Serve at\r\nonce with bits of broken ice in the glasses, or place the pitcher on ice\r\nuntil ready to serve.\r\n\r\nFRUIT BEVERAGE.--A great variety of pleasant, healthful drinks may\r\nbe made by taking equal quantities of water and the juice of currants,\r\nstrawberries, raspberries, cherries, or a mixture of two kinds, as\r\nraspberries and currants, sweetening to taste, and putting into each\r\nglass a small lump of ice. Directions for the preparation of fruit\r\njuices will be found on page 209.\r\n\r\nFRUIT BEVERAGE NO. 2.--Mash a pint of red raspberries, add one cup\r\nof canned pineapple or half a fresh one chopped fine; pour over all\r\nthree pints of water. Stir frequently, and let the mixture stand for two\r\nhours. Strain, add the juice of six lemons, and sugar or syrup to\r\nsweeten.\r\n\r\nANOTHER.--Extract the juice from three lemons and as many sour\r\noranges, add a quart of cold water, sugar or syrup to sweeten, half a\r\nteaspoonful of rose water, and a cup of pure grape juice; or the rose\r\nwater and grape juice may be omitted and two tablespoonfuls of\r\nstrawberry, raspberry, or cherry juice used instead, and the whole\r\npoured over half a dozen slices of pineapple, and allowed to stand until\r\nwell flavored before using.\r\n\r\nFRUIT CORDIAL.--Crush a pint of blackberries, raspberries, grapes,\r\ncurrants, or cherries, adding the juice of two sour oranges, and a\r\nsliced lemon; pour over all a quart of cold water. Stir the mixture\r\nfrequently and let it stand for two hours, then strain and add a syrup\r\nmade by dissolving white sugar in boiling water, sufficient to sweeten.\r\nCool on ice and serve.\r\n\r\nGRAPE BEVERAGE.--Crush two pounds of perfectly ripened purple\r\ngrapes and strain the juice through a jelly bag. Add to the juice three\r\ntablespoonfuls of granulated sugar or syrup, and dilute with cold water\r\nto suit the taste.\r\n\r\nLEMONADE.--Use three large or four medium-sized lemons for each\r\nquart of water, and from six to eight tablespoonfuls of sugar. Rub or\r\nsqueeze the lemons till soft. Cut a slice or two from each, and extract\r\nthe juice with a lemon drill; strain the juice through a fine wire\r\nstrainer to remove the seeds and bits of pulp, and pour it over the\r\nsugar. Add the slices of lemon, and pour over all a very little boiling\r\nwater to thoroughly dissolve the sugar; let it stand ten or fifteen\r\nminutes, then add the necessary quantity of cold water, and serve. Or\r\nrub the sugar over the outside of the lemons to flavor it, and make it\r\ninto a syrup by adding sufficient boiling water to dissolve it. Extract\r\nand strain the lemon juice, add the prepared syrup and the requisite\r\nquantity of cold water, and serve.\r\n\r\nMIXED LEMONADE.--A very pleasant, cooling summer drink is made from\r\nthe juice of six oranges and six lemons, with sugar to taste; add to\r\nthis some pounded ice and the juice of a small can of pineapple, and\r\nlastly pour over the whole two quarts of water.\r\n\r\nOATMEAL DRINK.--Boil one fourth of a pound of oatmeal in three\r\nquarts of water for half an hour, then add one and one half\r\ntablespoonfuls of sugar, strain and cool. It may be flavored with a\r\nlittle lemon or raspberry syrup if desired; or the sugar may be omitted\r\nand a quart of milk added. Cool on ice and serve.\r\n\r\nORANGEADE.--Pare very thin from one orange a few bits of the yellow\r\nrind. Slice three well-peeled sour oranges, taking care to remove all\r\nthe white portion and all seeds. Add the yellow rind and a tablespoonful\r\nof sugar; pour over all a quart of boiling water. Cover the dish, and\r\nlet it remain until the drink is cold. Or, if preferred, the juice of\r\nthe oranges may be extracted with a lemon drill and strained as for\r\nlemonade.\r\n\r\nPINEAPPLE BEVERAGE.--Pare and chop quite fine one fresh pineapple;\r\nadd a slice or two of lemon, and cover with three pints of boiling\r\nwater. Let it stand for two hours or more, stirring frequently; then\r\nstrain and add the juice of five lemons, and sugar or syrup to sweeten.\r\n\r\nPINEAPPLE LEMONADE.--Lemonade made in the usual manner and flavored\r\nwith a few spoonfuls of canned pineapple juice, is excellent for\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nPINK LEMONADE.--Add to a pint of lemonade prepared in the usual\r\nmanner half a cup of fresh or canned strawberry, red raspberry, currant,\r\nor cranberry juice. It gives a pretty color besides adding a pleasing\r\nflavor.\r\n\r\nSHERBET.--Mash a quart of red raspberries, currants, or\r\nstrawberries, add the juice of a lemon, and pour over all three pints of\r\ncold water. Stir frequently, and let it stand for two or three hours.\r\nStrain through a jelly bag, sweeten to taste, and serve.\r\n\r\nTISANE.--This is a favorite French beverage, and is prepared by\r\nchopping fine a cupful of dried fruits, such as prunes, figs, or\r\nprunelles, and steeping for an hour in a quart of water, afterward\r\nstraining, sweetening to taste, and cooling on ice before using.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE TOPICS.\r\n\r\n    The nervousness and peevishness of our times are chiefly\r\n    attributable to tea and coffee. The digestive organs of confirmed\r\n    coffee drinkers are in a state of chronic derangement which reacts\r\n    on the brain, producing fretful and lachrymose moods. The snappish,\r\n    petulant humor of the Chinese can certainly be ascribed to their\r\n    immoderate fondness for tea.--_Dr. Bock._\r\n\r\n    Dr. Ferguson, an eminent physician who has carefully investigated\r\n    the influence of tea and coffee upon the health and development of\r\n    children, says he found that children who were allowed these\r\n    beverages gained but four pounds a year between the ages of thirteen\r\n    and sixteen, while those who had been allowed milk instead, gained\r\n    fifteen pounds in weight during the same period.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Richardson, the eminent English physician and scientist, asserts\r\n    that the misery of the women of the poorer classes of the population\r\n    in England is more than doubled by the use of tea, which only\r\n    soothes or stimulates to intensify the after-coming depression and\r\n    languor.\r\n\r\n    A physician recommended a lady to abandon the use of tea and coffee.\r\n    \"O, but I shall miss it so,\" said she.\r\n\r\n    \"Very likely,\" replied her medical adviser, \"but you are missing\r\n    health now, and will soon lose it altogether if you do not.\"\r\n\r\n    Dr. Stenhouse, of Liverpool, once made a careful analysis of a\r\n    sample package of black tea, which was found to contain \"some pure\r\n    Congo tea leaves, also siftings of Pekoe and inferior kinds,\r\n    weighing together twenty-seven per cent of the whole. The remaining\r\n    seventy-three per cent was composed of the following substances;\r\n    Iron, plumbago, chalk, China-clay, sand, Prussian-blue, tumeric,\r\n    indigo, starch, gypsum, catechu, gum, the leaves of the camelia,\r\n    sarangna, _Chlorantes officinalis_, elm, oak, willow, poplar, elder,\r\n    beach, hawthorn, and sloe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMILK CREAM BUTTER\r\n\r\nMILK.\r\n\r\nChemically considered, the constituents of milk are nitrogenous matter\r\n(consisting of casein and a small proportion of albumen), fat, sugar of\r\nmilk, mineral matter, and water, the last constituting from sixty-five\r\nto ninety per cent of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of these elements varies greatly in the milk of different\r\nanimals of the same species and of the same animals at different times,\r\nso that it is not possible to give an exact analysis.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of an average specimen of cow's milk, according to Letheby,\r\nis:--\r\n\r\n    Nitrogenous matter.......................................4.1\r\n    Fat......................................................3.9\r\n    Sugar of milk............................................5.2\r\n    Mineral matter...........................................0.8\r\n    Water...................................................86.0\r\n\r\nIf a drop of milk be examined with a microscope, it will be seen as a\r\nclear liquid, holding in suspension a large number of minute globules,\r\nwhich give the milk its opacity or white color. These microscopic\r\nglobules are composed of fatty matter, each surrounded by an envelope of\r\ncasein, the principal nitrogenous element found in milk. They are\r\nlighter than the surrounding liquid, and when the milk remains at rest,\r\nthey gradually rise to the top and form cream. Casein, unlike albumen,\r\nis not coagulated by heat; hence when milk is cooked, it undergoes no\r\nnoticeable change, save the coagulation of the very small amount of\r\nalbumen it contains, which, as it solidifies, rises to the top, carrying\r\nwith it a small portion of the sugar and saline matter and some of the\r\nfat globules, forming a skin-like scum upon the surface. Casein,\r\nalthough not coagulable by heat, is coagulated by the introduction into\r\nthe milk of acids or extract of rennet. The curd of cheese is coagulated\r\ncasein. When milk is allowed to stand for some time exposed to warmth\r\nand air, a spontaneous coagulation occurs, caused by fermentative\r\nchanges in the sugar of milk, by which it is converted into lactic acid\r\nthrough the action of germs.\r\n\r\nMilk is sometimes adulterated by water, the removal of more or less of\r\nthe cream, or the addition of some foreign substance to increase its\r\ndensity.\r\n\r\nThe quality of milk is more or less influenced by the food upon which\r\nthe animal is fed. Watery milk may be produced by feeding a cow upon\r\nsloppy food.\r\n\r\nThe milk of diseased animals should never be used for food. There is no\r\nway by which such milk can invariably be detected, but Prof. Vaughan, of\r\nMichigan University, notes the following kinds of milk to be avoided:\r\n\r\n1. Milk which becomes sour and curdles within a few hours after it has\r\nbeen drawn, and before any cream forms on its surface. This is known in\r\nsome sections as 'curdly' milk, and it comes from cows with certain\r\ninflammatory affections of the udder, or digestive diseases, or those\r\nwhich have been overdriven or worried.\r\n\r\n2. \"Bitter-sweet milk\" has cream of a bitter taste, is covered with\r\n'blisters,' and frequently with a fine mold. Butter and cheese made from\r\nsuch milk cannot be eaten on account of the disagreeable taste.\r\n\r\n3. 'Slimy milk' can be drawn out into fine, ropy fibers. It has an\r\nunpleasant taste, which is most marked in the cream. The causes which\r\nlead to the secretion of this milk are not known.\r\n\r\n4. 'Blue milk' is characterized by the appearance on its surface,\r\neighteen or twenty-four hours after it is drawn, of small, indigo-blue\r\nspots, which rapidly enlarge until the whole surface is covered with a\r\nblue film. If the milk be allowed to stand a few days, the blue is\r\nconverted into a greenish or reddish color. This coloration of the milk\r\nis due to the growth of microscopic organisms. The butter made from\r\n'blue milk' is dirty-white, gelatinous, and bitter.\r\n\r\n5. 'Barnyard milk' is a term used to designate milk taken from unclean\r\nanimals, or those which have been kept in filthy, unventilated stables.\r\nThe milk absorbs and carries the odors, which are often plainly\r\nperceptible. Such milk may not be poisonous, but it is repulsive.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that milk often serves as the vehicle for the\r\ndistribution of the germs of various contagious diseases, like scarlet\r\nfever, diphtheria, and typhoid fever, from becoming contaminated in some\r\nway, either from the hands of milkers or from water used as an\r\nadulterant or in cleansing the milk vessels. Recent investigations have\r\nalso shown that cows are to some extent subject to scarlet fever, the\r\nsame as human beings, and that milk from infected cows will produce the\r\nsame disease in the consumer.\r\n\r\nMilk should not be kept in brass or copper vessels or in earthen-ware\r\nlined with lead glazing; for if the milk becomes acid, it is likely to\r\nunite with the metal and form a poisonous compound. Glass and granite\r\nware are better materials in which to keep milk.\r\n\r\nMilk should never be allowed to stand uncovered in an occupied room,\r\nespecially a sitting-room or bedroom, as its dust is likely to contain\r\ndisease-germs, which falling into the milk, may become a source of\r\nserious illness to the consumer. Indeed it is safest to keep milk\r\ncovered whenever set away, to exclude the germs which are at all times\r\npresent in the air. A good way is to protect the dishes containing milk\r\nwith several layers of cheese-cloth, which will permit the air but not\r\nthe germs to circulate in and out of the pans. Neither should it be\r\nallowed to stand where there are strong odors, as it readily takes up by\r\nabsorption any odors to which it is exposed.\r\n\r\nA few years ago Dr. Dougall, of Glasgow, made some very interesting\r\nexperiments on the absorbent properties of milk. He inclosed in jars a\r\nportion of substances giving off emanations, with a uniform quantity of\r\nmilk, in separate vessels, for a period of eight hours, at the end of\r\nwhich time samples of the milk were drawn off and tested. The result was\r\nthat milk exposed to the following substances retained odors as\r\ndescribed:--\r\n\r\nCoal gas, distinct; paraffine oil, strong; turpentine, very strong;\r\nonions, very strong; tobacco smoke, very strong; ammonia, moderate;\r\nmusk, faint; asafetida, distinct; creosote, strong; cheese (stale),\r\ndistinct; chloroform, moderate; putrid fish, very bad; camphor,\r\nmoderate; decayed cabbage, distinct.\r\n\r\nThese facts clearly indicate that if the emanations to which milk is\r\nexposed are of a diseased and dangerous quality, it is all but\r\nimpossible that the milk can remain free from dangerous properties.\r\n\r\nToo much pains cannot be taken in the care of milk and vessels\r\ncontaining it. Contact with the smallest quantity of milk which has\r\nundergone fermentation will sour the whole; hence the necessity for\r\nscrupulous cleanliness of all vessels which have contained milk before\r\nthey are used again for that purpose.\r\n\r\nIn washing milk dishes, many persons put them first into scalding water,\r\nby which means the albumen in the milk is coagulated; and if there are\r\nany crevices or seams in the pans or pails, this coagulated portion is\r\nlikely to adhere to them like glue, and becoming sour, will form the\r\nnucleus for spoiling the next milk put into them. A better way is first\r\nto rinse each separately in cold water, not pouring the water from one\r\npan to another, until there is not the slightest milky appearance in the\r\nwater, then wash in warm suds, or water containing sal-soda, and\r\nafterward scald thoroughly; wipe perfectly dry, and place if possible\r\nwhere the sun will have free access to them until they are needed for\r\nfurther use. If sunshine is out of the question, invert the pans or cans\r\nover the stove, or place for a few moments in a hot oven.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of milk varies with its intended use, whether whole or\r\nseparated from the cream.\r\n\r\nCream rises best when the milk is quite warm or when near the\r\nfreezing-point. In fact, cream separates more easily from milk at the\r\nfreezing-point than any other, but it is not thick and never becomes so.\r\nAn intermediate state seems to be unfavorable to a full rising of the\r\ncream.\r\n\r\nA temperature of 56° to 60°F. is a good one. Milk to be used whole\r\nshould be kept at about 45° and stirred frequently.\r\n\r\nAll milk obtained from city milkmen or any source not certainly known to\r\nbe free from disease-germs, should be sterilized before using. Indeed,\r\nit is safest always to sterilize milk before using, since during the\r\nmilking or in subsequent handling and transportation it is liable to\r\nbecome infected with germs.\r\n\r\nTO STERILIZE MILK FOR IMMEDIATE USE.--Put the milk as soon as\r\nreceived into the inner dish of a double boiler, the outer vessel of\r\nwhich should be filled with boiling water. Cover and heat the milk\r\nrapidly to as near the boiling point as possible. Allow it to remain\r\nwith the water in the outer boiler actively boiling for half an hour,\r\nthen remove from the stove and cool very quickly. This may be\r\naccomplished by pouring into shallow dishes, and placing these in cold\r\nwater, changing the water as frequently as it becomes warm, or by using\r\npieces of ice in the water. It is especially important to remember that\r\nthe temperature of the milk should be raised as rapidly as possible, and\r\nwhen the milk is sufficiently cooked, cooled very quickly. Either very\r\nslow heating or slow cooling may prove disastrous, even when every other\r\nprecaution is taken.\r\n\r\nOr, well-cleaned glass fruit cans may be nearly filled with milk, the\r\ncovers screwed on loosely, then placed in a kettle of cold water,\r\ngradually heated to boiling and kept at that temperature for a half hour\r\nor longer, then gradually cooled. Or, perfectly clean bottles may be\r\nfilled with milk to within two inches of the top, the neck tightly\r\nclosed with a wad of cotton, and the bottles placed in a steam cooker,\r\nthe water in which should be cold at the start, and steamed for half an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nThis cooking of milk, while it destroys many of the germs contained in\r\nmilk, particularly the active disease-germs which are liable to be found\r\nin it, thus rendering it more wholesome, and improving its keeping\r\nqualities somewhat, does not so completely sterilize the milk that it\r\nwill not undergo fermentative changes. Under varying conditions some\r\nthirty or forty different species of germs are to be found in milk, some\r\nof which require to be subjected to a temperature above that of boiling\r\nwater, in order to destroy them. The keeping quality of the milk may be\r\nincreased by reboiling it on three successive days for a half hour or\r\nlonger, and carefully sealing after each boiling.\r\n\r\nTO STERILIZE MILK TO KEEP.--This is a somewhat more difficult\r\noperation, but it may be done by boiling milk sealed in very strong\r\nbottles in a saturated solution of salt. The milk used should be\r\nperfectly fresh. It is best, when possible, to draw the milk from the\r\ncow directly into the bottles. Fill the bottles to within two inches of\r\nthe top, cork them immediately and wire the corks down firmly and place\r\nthem in the cold salt solution. Boil fifteen minutes or half an hour.\r\nAllow the solution to cool before removing them. If the bottles are\r\nremoved from the solution while hot, they will almost instantly break.\r\nWhen cold, remove the bottles, and cover the tops with sealing wax.\r\nStore in a cool place, shake thoroughly once or twice a week. Milk\r\nsterilized in this manner will keep indefinitely.\r\n\r\nCONDENSED MILK.--Condensed milk is made by evaporating milk in a\r\nvacuum to one fifth its original volume; it is then canned like any\r\nother food by sealing at boiling temperature in air-tight cans. When\r\nused, it should be diluted with five times its bulk of warm water.\r\n\r\nCondensed milk, when not thoroughly boiled in the process of\r\ncondensation, is liable to harbor disease-germs the same as any other\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\n\r\nCREAM.\r\n\r\nCream varies in composition according to the circumstances under which\r\nit rises.\r\n\r\nThe composition of an average specimen as given by Letherby is:--\r\n\r\n    Nitrogenous matter............................................ 2.7\r\n    Fat.......................................................... 26.7\r\n    Sugar of milk................................................. 2.8\r\n    Mineral matter................................................ 1.8\r\n    Water........................................................ 66.0\r\n\r\nIn the process of churning; the membranes of casein which surround each\r\nof the little globules constituting the cream are broken, and the fat of\r\nwhich they are composed becomes a compact mass known as butter. The\r\nwatery looking residue containing casein, sugar of milk, mineral matter,\r\nand a small proportion of fat, comprises the buttermilk.\r\n\r\nSkim-milk, or milk from which the cream has been removed, and buttermilk\r\nare analogous in chemical composition.\r\n\r\nThe composition of each, according to Dr. Edward Smith, is:--\r\n\r\nSKIM-MILK\r\n\r\n    Nitrogenous matter......................................... 4.0\r\n    Sugar...................................................... 3.8\r\n    Fat........................................................ 1.8\r\n    Mineral matter............................................. 0.8\r\n    Water......................................................88.0\r\n\r\nBUTTERMILK\r\n\r\n    Nitrogenous matter..........................................4.1\r\n    Sugar.......................................................3.6\r\n    Fat.........................................................0.7\r\n    Mineral matter..............................................0.8\r\n    Water......................................................88.0\r\n\r\nSkim-milk and buttermilk, when the butter is made from sweet cream and\r\ntaken fresh, are both excellent foods, although lacking the fat of new\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nCream is more easily digested than butter, and since it contains other\r\nelements besides fat, is likewise more nutritious. In cream the fat is\r\nheld in the form of an emulsion which allows it to mingle freely with\r\nwater. As previously stated, each atom of fat is surrounded with a film\r\nof casein. The gastric juice has no more power to digest casein than it\r\nhas free fat, and the little particles of fat thus protected are carried\r\nto the small intestines, where the pancreatic juice digests them, and on\r\ntheir way they do not interfere with the stomach digestion of other\r\nfoods, as the presence of butter and other free fats may do.\r\n\r\nIt is because of its greater wholesomeness that in the directions for\r\nthe preparation of foods given in this work we have given preference to\r\nthe use of cream over that of butter and other free fats. The usual\r\nobjection to its use is its expense, and the difficulty of obtaining it\r\nfrom city dealers. The law of supply and cost generally corresponds with\r\nthat of demand, and doubtless cream would prove no exception if its use\r\nwere more general.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Creamery.]\r\n\r\nCream may be sterilized and preserved in a pure state for some time, the\r\nsame as milk.\r\n\r\nMilk requires especial care to secure a good quality and quantity of\r\ncream. Scrupulous cleanliness, good ventilation, and an unvarying\r\ntemperature are absolute essentials. The common custom of setting milk\r\nin pans is objectionable, not only because of the dust and germs always\r\nliable to fall into the milk, but also from the difficulty of keeping\r\nmilk thus set at the proper temperature for cream-rising. Every family\r\nusing milk in any quantity ought to have a set of creameries of large or\r\nsmall capacity according to circumstances, in which the milk supply can\r\nbe kept in a pure, wholesome condition, and so arranged as to facilitate\r\nthe full rising of the cream if desired. A very simple and satisfactory\r\ncreamery, with space for ice around the milk, similar to that\r\nrepresented in the accompanying cut, may be constructed by any tinman.\r\n\r\nThe plan of scalding milk to facilitate the rising of the cream is\r\nexcellent, as it not only secures a more speedy rising, but serves to\r\ndestroy the germs found in the milk, thus lessening its tendency to\r\nsour. The best way to do this is to heat the milk in a double boiler, or\r\na dish set inside another containing hot water, to a temperature of 150°\r\nto 165°F. as indicated by wrinkles upon its surface. The milk must not,\r\nhowever, be allowed to come to a boil. When scalded, it should be cooled\r\nat once to a temperature of about 60° F. and kept thus during the rising\r\nof the cream.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTER.\r\n\r\nOf all foods wholly composed of fat, good fresh butter is the most\r\nwholesome. It should, however, be used unmelted and taken in a finely\r\ndivided state, and only in very moderate quantities. If exposed to great\r\nheat, as on hot buttered toast, meats, rich pastry, etc., it is quite\r\nindigestible. We do not recommend its use either for the table or for\r\ncooking purposes when cream can be obtained, since butter is rarely\r\nfound in so pure a state that it is not undergoing more or less\r\ndecomposition, depending upon its age and the amount of casein retained\r\nin the butter through the carelessness of the manufacturer.\r\n\r\nCasein, on exposure to air in a moist state, rapidly changes into a\r\nferment, which, acting upon the fatty matter of the butter, produces\r\nrancidity, rendering the butter more or less unwholesome. Poor, tainted,\r\nor rancid butter should not be used as food in any form.\r\n\r\nGood butter is pale yellow, uniform throughout the whole mass, and free\r\nfrom rancid taste or odor. White lumps in it are due to the\r\nincorporation of sour milk with the cream from which it was produced. A\r\nwatery, milk-like fluid exuding from the freshly cut surface of butter,\r\nis evidence that insufficient care was taken to wash out all the\r\nbuttermilk, thus increasing its liability to spoil.\r\n\r\nThe flavor and color of butter vary considerably, according to the breed\r\nand food of the animal from which the milk was obtained. An artificial\r\ncolor is often given to butter by the use of a preparation of annatto.\r\n\r\nBoth salt and saltpeter are employed as preservatives for butter; a\r\nlarge quantity of the former is often used to increase the weight of the\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL BUTTER.--Various fraudulent preparations are sold as\r\nbutter. Oleomargarine, one of the commonest, is made from tallow or\r\nbeef-fat, cleaned and ground like sausage, and heated, to separate the\r\noil from the membranes. It is then known as \"butter-oil,\" is salted,\r\ncooled, pressed, and churned in milk, colored with annatto, and treated\r\nthe same as butter. Butterine, another artificial product, is prepared\r\nby mixing butter-oil and a similar oil obtained from lard, then churning\r\nthem with milk.\r\n\r\nAn eminent analyst gives the following excellent way of distinguishing\r\ngenuine butter from oleomargarine:--\"When true butter is heated over a\r\nclear flame, it 'browns' and gives out a pleasant odor,--that of browned\r\nbutter. In heating there is more or less sputtering, caused by minute\r\nparticles of water retained in washing the butter. On the bottom of the\r\npan or vessel in which true butter is heated, a yellowish-brown crust is\r\nformed, consisting of roasted or toasted casein. When oleomargarine is\r\nheated under similar circumstances, it does not 'brown,' but becomes\r\ndarker by overheating, and when heated to dryness, gives off a grayish\r\nsteam, smelling of tallow. There is no 'sputtering' when it is being\r\nheated, but it boils easily. If a pledget of cotton or a wick saturated\r\nwith oleomargarine be set on fire and allowed to burn a few moments\r\nbefore being extinguished, it will give out fumes which are very\r\ncharacteristic, smelling strongly of tallow, while true butter behaves\r\nvery differently.\"\r\n\r\nBUTTER IN ANCIENT TIMES.--Two kinds of butter seem to have been\r\nknown to the ancient Jews, one quite like that of the present day,\r\nexcept that it was boiled after churning, so that it became in that warm\r\nclimate practically an oil; the other, a sort of curdled milk. The juice\r\nof the Jerusalem artichoke was mixed with the milk, when it was churned\r\nuntil a sort of curd was separated. The Oriental method of churning was\r\nby putting the milk into a goat-skin and swinging and shaking the bag\r\nuntil the butter came, as illustrated in the accompanying cut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Oriental Butter-Making.]\r\n\r\nAn article still sold as butter in Athens is made by boiling the milk of\r\ngoats, allowing it to sour, and then churning in a goat-skin. The result\r\nis a thick, white, foamy substance appearing more like cream than\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\nBUTTER-MAKING.--The manufacture of good butter is dependent upon\r\ngood cows and the care given them, as well as most careful treatment of\r\nthe milk and cream. The milk to be used for butter making, as indeed for\r\nall purposes, should be most carefully strained through a wire strainer\r\ncovered with three or four thicknesses of perfectly clean cheese cloth.\r\n\r\nThe following points given by an experienced dairyman will be found\r\nworthy of consideration by all who have to do with the manufacture of\r\nthis article:--\r\n\r\n\"Milk is almost as sensitive to atmospheric changes as mercury itself.\r\nIt is a question among many as to what depth milk should be set to get\r\nthe most cream. It does not make so much difference as to the depth as\r\nit does the protection of the milk from acid or souring. As soon as the\r\nmilk begins to sour, the cream ceases to rise.\r\n\r\n\"With a clear, dry atmosphere the cream will rise clean in the milk; but\r\nin that condition of the atmosphere which readily sours the milk, the\r\ncream will not rise clean, but seems to hang in the milk, and this even\r\nwhen the milk is protected by being set in water.\r\n\r\n\"The benefit of setting milk in cold water is that the water protects\r\nthe milk from becoming acid until the cream has time to rise. For cream\r\nto rise readily on milk set in cold water, the atmosphere in the room\r\nshould be warmer than the water. As much cream will rise on milk set in\r\ncold water in one hour as on milk not set in water in twenty-four hours.\r\nThe milk should be skimmed while sweet, and the cream thoroughly stirred\r\nat each skimming.\r\n\r\n\"Cream skimmed from different milkings, if churned at the same time in\r\none churn, should be mixed eight to ten hours before churning; then the\r\ncream will all come alike.\r\n\r\n\"The keeping qualities of butter depend principally upon two things:\r\nFirst, the buttermilk must be all gotten out; and secondly, the grain of\r\nthe butter should be kept as perfect as possible. Butter should not be\r\nallowed to be churned after it has fairly come, and should not be\r\ngathered compactly in the churn in taking out, but the buttermilk should\r\nbe drained from the butter in the churn, through a hair sieve, letting\r\nthe butter remain in the churn. Then take water and turn it upon the\r\nbutter with sufficient force to pass through the butter, and in\r\nsufficient quantity to rinse the buttermilk all out of the butter. With\r\nthis process of washing the butter the grain is not injured or mashed,\r\nand is thus far kept perfect. And in working in the salt the ladle or\r\nroll or worker, whatever it is, should never be allowed to slip on the\r\nbutter,--if it does, it will destroy the grain,--but it should go upon\r\nthe butter in a pressing or rolling motion.\"\r\n\r\nTest the temperature of the cream with a thermometer, and churn it at\r\n60° in summer and 62° in winter. If the butter is soft, it may be\r\nhardened by pouring onto it while working a brine made by dissolving a\r\npint of salt in ten quarts of water. The salt used in the butter should\r\nbe carefully measured, three fourths of an ounce of salt to the pound\r\nbeing the usual allowance.\r\n\r\nButter, like milk, absorbs odors readily, and should never be allowed to\r\nremain in occupied rooms or any place exposed to strong or foul odors,\r\nbut be kept covered in a cold place.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEESE.\r\n\r\nCheese is a product of milk prepared by separating the casein, with more\r\nor less of the cream, according to the manner in which it has been\r\nprepared, from the other ingredients of the milk. It is an article,\r\nwhich, although possessing a large proportion, of nutritive material, is\r\nvery difficult of digestion, and the use of which is very questionable,\r\nnot only for this reason, but because it is very liable to contain a\r\npoison called tyrotoxicon, capable of producing most violent and indeed\r\nfatal results, according to the remarkable researches of Prof. Vaughan\r\nof Michigan University. This poison is sometimes found in ice cream and\r\ncustards, cream-puffs, etc., made from stale milk or cream.\r\n\r\nIt is much better to use milk in its fresh, natural state than in any of\r\nits products. Made into either butter or cheese, we lose some of its\r\nessential elements, so that what is left is not a perfect food.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES_\r\n\r\nHOT MILK.--Milk is more easily digested when used hot. This is not\r\ndue to any marked chemical change in the milk, but to the stimulating\r\neffect of heat upon the palate and stomach.\r\n\r\nTo prepare hot milk, heat it in a double boiler until a wrinkled skin\r\nappears upon the surface. In the double boiler it may be kept at the\r\nproper temperature for a long time without difficulty, and thus\r\nprepared, it forms one of the most healthful of foods.\r\n\r\nMilk, either cold or hot, should be taken a few sips only at a time, and\r\nnot be drank in copious draughts when used in connection with other\r\nfoods at mealtime. It will then coagulate in the stomach in small flakes\r\nmuch more easily digested than the large mass resulting when a large\r\nquantity is swallowed at a time.\r\n\r\nDEVONSHIRE OR CLOTTED CREAM.--This is prepared as follows: Strain\r\nthe milk as it comes fresh from the cow into a deep pan which will fit\r\ntightly over a kettle in which water can be boiled, and set away in a\r\ncool well-ventilated place, where it should be allowed to remain\r\nundisturbed from eight to twelve hours or longer. Then take the pan up\r\nvery carefully so as not to disturb the cream, place over a kettle of\r\nwater, heat to near the boiling point, or until a rim of bubbles half an\r\ninch wide forms all around the dish of milk. It must not, however, be\r\nallowed to boil, or the cream will be injured. Now lift the pan again\r\nwith equal care back to a cool place and allow it to stand from twelve\r\nto twenty-four hours longer. The cream should be a compact mass of\r\nconsiderable thickness, and may be divided with a knife into squares of\r\nconvenient size before skimming. It is delicious for use on fruit and\r\ngrains.\r\n\r\nCOTTAGE CHEESE.--This dish is usually prepared from milk which has\r\ncurdled from lack of proper care, or from long standing exposed to the\r\nair, and which is thus in some degree decomposing. But the fact that the\r\ncasein of the milk is coagulated by the use of acids makes it possible\r\nto prepare this dish in a more wholesome manner without waiting for\r\ndecomposition of the milk. Add to each four quarts of milk one cupful of\r\nlemon juice; let it stand until coagulated, then heat slowly, but do not\r\nboil, until the curd has entirely separated from the whey. Turn the\r\nwhole into a colander lined with a square of clean cheese cloth, and\r\ndrain off the whey. Add to the curd a little salt and cream, mix all\r\ntogether with a spoon or the hands, and form into cakes or balls for the\r\ntable. The use of lemon gives a delicious flavor, which may be\r\nintensified, if desired, by using a trifle of the grated yellow rind.\r\n\r\nCOTTAGE CHEESE FROM BUTTERMILK.--Place a pail of fresh buttermilk\r\nin a kettle of boiling water, taking care to have sufficient water to\r\ncome up even with the milk in the pail. Let the buttermilk remain until\r\nit is heated throughout to about 140°, which can be determined by\r\nkeeping a thermometer in the milk and stirring it frequently. When it is\r\nsufficiently heated, empty the curd into strong muslin bags and hang up\r\nto drain for several hours. If properly scalded and drained, the curd\r\nwill be quite dry and may be seasoned and served the same as other\r\ncottage cheese. If scalded too much, it will be watery.\r\n\r\nCOTTAGE CHEESE WITH SOUR MILK.--Take a pan of newly-loppered thick\r\nsour milk, and place it over a kettle of boiling water until the whey\r\nseparates from the curd, breaking and cutting the curd as the milk\r\nbecomes warmed, so as to allow the whey to settle. The milk should be\r\nwell scalded, but not allowed to boil, as that will render the curd\r\ntough and leathery. Have ready a clean piece of cheese cloth spread\r\ninside a colander, dip the curd into it, and leave it to drain. If\r\npreferred, the corners of the cloth may be tied with a string, thus\r\nforming a bag in which the cheese may be hung up to drain. When well\r\ndrained, remove the dry curd to a dish, rub it fine with the hands, add\r\nsalt, and season with sweet cream, beating it well through the curd with\r\na silver fork. It may be shaped into balls with the hands or pressed in\r\nlarge cups or bowls.\r\n\r\nFRENCH BUTTER.--Fill a large, wide-mouthed glass bottle or jar\r\nabout half full of thick sweet cream. Cork tightly, and with one end of\r\nthe bottle in each hand shake it vigorously back and forth until the\r\nbutter has separated from the milk, which it will generally do in a few\r\nminutes. Work out the buttermilk, make into small pats, and place on ice\r\nuntil ready to serve. As a rule this butter is not washed or salted, as\r\nit is intended for immediate use.\r\n\r\nSHAKEN MILK.--Fit a conical tin cup closely over a glass of milk\r\nand shake it vigorously until all of a foam, after which it should be\r\nslowly sipped at once; or a glass of milk may be put into a quart fruit\r\ncan, the cover tightly screwed on, and then shaken back and forth until\r\nthe milk is foamy.\r\n\r\nEMULSIFIED BUTTER.--Boil the butter with water for half an hour to\r\ndestroy any germs it may contain; use plenty of water and add the butter\r\nto it while cold. When boiled, remove from the fire and allow it to\r\nbecome nearly cold, when the butter will have risen to the top and may\r\nbe removed with a skimmer, or it may be separated from the water by\r\nturning the whole after cooling into a clean strainer cloth placed\r\ninside a colander. The butter may be pressed in the cloth if any water\r\nstill remains. If hardened, reheat just sufficient to soften, and add to\r\nit, while still liquid, but cooled to about blood heat, the yolk of one\r\negg for each tablespoonful of butter, and stir until very thoroughly\r\nmingled.\r\n\r\nOr, add to each tablespoonful of the liquid butter two level\r\ntablespoonfuls of flour, rub together thoroughly, and cook until\r\nthickened in a half cupful of boiling water. If cream is not obtainable\r\nand butter must be used for seasoning, it is preferable to prepare it in\r\none of the above ways for the purpose, using the quantity given as an\r\nequivalent of one cupful of thin cream. It will be evident, however,\r\nthat these preparations will not only season but thicken whatever they\r\nare used in, and that additional liquid should be used on that account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE TOPICS.\r\n\r\n    A little six-year-old boy went into the country visiting. About the\r\n    first thing he got was a bowl of bread and milk. He tasted it, and\r\n    then hesitated a moment, when his mother asked if he didn't like it;\r\n    to which he replied, smacking his lips, \"Yes, ma'am. I was only\r\n    wishing that our milkman in town would keep a cow!\"\r\n\r\n    When Horace Greeley was candidate for the presidency, he at one time\r\n    visited New Orleans, whose old creole residents gave him a dinner;\r\n    and to make it as fine an affair as possible, each of the many\r\n    guests was laid under contribution for some of the rarest wines in\r\n    his cellar. When dinner was announced, and the first course was\r\n    completed, the waiter appeared at Mr. Greeley's seat with a plate of\r\n    shrimp. \"You can take them away,\" he said to the waiter, and then\r\n    added to the horrified French creole gentleman who presided, \"I\r\n    never eat insects of any kind.\" Later on, soup was served, and at\r\n    the same time a glass of white wine was placed at Mr. Greeley's\r\n    right hand. He pushed it quietly away, but not unobserved by the\r\n    chief host. \"Do you not drink wine?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n    \"No,\" answered Mr. Greeley; \"I never drink any liquors.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Is there anything you would like to drink with your soup?\" the host\r\n    then asked, a little disappointed.\r\n\r\n    \"If you've got it,\" answered Mr. Greeley, \"and it isn't any trouble,\r\n    I'd like a glass of fresh buttermilk.\"\r\n\r\n    Said the host afterward in his broken English, \"Ze idea of electing\r\n    to ze presidency a man vot drink buttermilk vis his soup!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    Old friendships are often destroyed by toasted cheese, and hard\r\n    salted meat has often led to suicide.--_Sydney Smith._\r\n\r\n\r\n    A German sitting beside a Spanish officer on board a Havana steamer,\r\n    was munching Limberger cheese with evident satisfaction when it\r\n    occurred to him that he ought to offer some to his neighbor, who\r\n    very coolly declined. \"You think it unhealthful to eat that?\"\r\n    inquired the German in polite astonishment. \"_Unhealthful?_\"\r\n    exclaimed the Hidalgo, with a withering look and a gasp for a more\r\n    adequate word; \"No, sir: I think it an unnatural crime!\"--_Oswald._\r\n\r\n\r\n    Good for Dyspepsia.--\"Really, don't you think cheese is good for\r\n    dyspepsia?\" said an advocate of the use of this common article of\r\n    food. \"Why, my uncle had dyspepsia all his life, and he took a bit\r\n    of cheese at the close of every meal!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mattieu Williams tells us, \"When common sense and true sentiment\r\n    supplant mere unreasoning prejudice, vegetables oils and vegetable\r\n    fats will largely supplant those of animal origin in every element\r\n    of our dietary.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEGGS\r\n\r\nAs will be seen from the analysis given below, an egg is particularly\r\nrich in nitrogenous elements. It is indeed one of the most highly\r\nconcentrated forms of nitrogenous food, about one third of its weight\r\nbeing solid nutriment, and for this reason is often found serviceable in\r\ncases of sickness where it is desirable to secure a large amount of\r\nnourishment in small bulk.\r\n\r\nComposition of the white of an ordinary hen's egg.\r\n\r\n    Nitrogenous matter..................... 20.4\r\n    Fatty matter........................... 10.0\r\n    Mineral matter.........................  1.6\r\n    Water.................................. 68.0\r\n\r\nComposition of the yolk.\r\n\r\n    Nitrogenous matter.....................  1.0\r\n    Fatty matter........................... 30.7\r\n    Mineral matter.........................  1.3\r\n    Water.................................. 52.0\r\n\r\nThe white of egg is composed mainly of albumen in a dissolved state,\r\ninclosed in layers of thin membrane. When beaten, the membranes are\r\nbroken, and the liberated albumen, owing to its viscous or glutinous\r\nnature, entangles and retains a large amount of air, thus increasing to\r\nseveral times its original bulk.\r\n\r\nThe yolk contains all the fatty matter, and this, with a modified form\r\nof albumen called vitellin, forms a kind of yellow emulsion. It is\r\ninclosed in a thin membrane, which separates it from the surrounding\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nThe yolk, being lighter than the white, floats to that portion of the\r\negg which is uppermost, but is held in position by two membranous cords,\r\none from each end of the egg. The average weight of an egg is about two\r\nounces, of which ten per cent consists of shell, sixty of white, and\r\nthirty of yolk.\r\n\r\nHOW TO CHOOSE EGGS.--The quality of eggs varies considerably,\r\naccording to the food upon which the fowls are fed. Certain foods\r\ncommunicate distinct flavors, and it is quite probable that eggs may be\r\nrendered unwholesome through the use of filthy or improper food; hence\r\nit is always best, when practicable, to ascertain respecting the diet\r\nand care of the fowls before purchasing eggs.\r\n\r\nOn no account select eggs about the freshness of which there is any\r\nreason to doubt. The use of stale eggs may result in serious\r\ndisturbances of the digestive organs.\r\n\r\nAn English gentleman who has investigated the subject quite thoroughly,\r\nfinds upon careful microscopical examination that stale eggs often\r\ncontain cells of a peculiar fungoid growth, which seems to have\r\ndeveloped from that portion of the egg which would have furnished\r\nmaterial for the flesh and bones of the chick had the process of\r\ndevelopment been continued. Experiments with such eggs upon dogs produce\r\npoisonous effects.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways of determining with tolerable accuracy respecting\r\nthe freshness of an egg. A common test is to place it between the eye\r\nand a strong light. If fresh, the white will appear translucent, and the\r\noutline of the yolk can be distinctly traced. By keeping, eggs become\r\ncloudy, and when decidedly stale, a distinct, dark, cloud-like\r\nappearance may be discerned opposite some portion of the shell. Another\r\ntest is to shake the egg gently at the ear; if a gurgle or thud is\r\nheard, the egg is bad. Again, eggs may be tested by dropping into a\r\nvessel containing a solution of salt and water, in the proportion of a\r\ntablespoonful to a quart. Newly laid eggs will sink; if more than six\r\ndays old, they will float in the liquid; if bad, they will be so light\r\nas to ride on the surface of the brine. The shell of a freshly laid egg\r\nis almost full; but owing to the porous character of the shell, with age\r\nand exposure to air a portion of the liquid substance of which the egg\r\nis composed evaporates, and air accumulates in its place at one of the\r\nextremities of the shell. Hence an egg loses in density from day to day,\r\nand the longer the egg has been kept, the lighter it becomes, and the\r\nhigher it will rise in the liquid.\r\n\r\nAn egg that will float on the surface of the liquid is of too\r\nquestionable a character to be used without breaking, and is apt to be\r\nunfit for use at all.\r\n\r\nHOW TO KEEP EGGS.--To preserve the interior of an egg in its\r\nnatural state, it is necessary to seal the pores of the shell air-tight,\r\nas the air which finds its way into the egg through the pores of the\r\nshell causes gradual decomposition. Various methods are devised to\r\nexclude the air and thus preserve the egg. A good way is to dip\r\nperfectly fresh eggs into a thick solution of gum-arabic,--equal parts\r\nof gum and water,--let the eggs dry and dip them again, taking care that\r\nthe shells are entirely covered with the solution each time. When dry,\r\nwrap separately in paper and pack in a box of sawdust, bran, salt, or\r\npowdered charcoal, and cover tightly to keep out the air.\r\n\r\nThere is a difference of opinion as to which end should be placed down\r\nin packing; most authorities recommend the smaller end. However, an\r\nexperienced poultryman offers the following reasons for packing with the\r\nlarger end down: \"The air-chamber is in the larger end, and if that is\r\nplaced down, the yolk will not break through and touch the shell and\r\nthereby spoil. Another thing: if the air-chamber is down, the egg is not\r\nso liable to shrink away.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be well for housekeepers to make the test by packing eggs from\r\nthe same lot each way and noting the result.\r\n\r\nMelted wax or suet may be used to coat the shells. Eggs are sometimes\r\nimmersed and kept in a solution of lime water, a pound of lime to a\r\ngallon of cold water, or simply packed in bran or salt, without a\r\nprevious coating of fat or gum. By any of these methods they will keep\r\nfor several weeks. Eggs, however, readily absorb flavors from\r\nsurrounding substances, and for that reason lime water or salt solution\r\nare somewhat objectionable. Nothing of a disagreeable odor should be\r\nplaced near eggs.\r\n\r\nEggs for boiling may be preserved by placing in a deep pan, and pouring\r\nscalding water over them. Let them stand half a minute, drain off the\r\nwater, and repeat the process two or three times. Wipe dry, and when\r\ncool, pack in bran.\r\n\r\nEggs should be kept in a cool, not cold, place and handled carefully, as\r\nrough treatment may cause the mingling of the yolk and white by\r\nrupturing the membrane which separates them; then the egg will spoil\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nThe time required for the digestion of a perfectly cooked egg varies\r\nfrom three to four hours.\r\n\r\nIt is generally conceded that eggs lightly cooked are most readily\r\ndigested. What is generally termed a hard-boiled egg is not easily acted\r\nupon by the digestive juices, and any other manner of cooking by which\r\nthe albumen becomes hardened and solid offers great resistance to\r\ndigestion.\r\n\r\nTO BEAT EGGS.--This may seem trivial, but no dish requiring eggs\r\ncan be prepared in perfection, unless they are properly beaten, even if\r\nevery other ingredient is the best. An egg-beater or an egg-whip is the\r\nmost convenient utensil for the purpose; but if either of these is not\r\nto be had, a silver fork will do very well, and with this the beating\r\nshould be done in sharp, quick strokes, dipping the fork in and out in\r\nrapid succession, while the egg should grow firmer and stiffer with\r\nevery stroke. When carelessly beaten, the result will be a coarse and\r\nfrothy instead of a thick and cream-like mass. Use a bowl in beating\r\neggs with an egg-beater, and a plate when a fork or egg-whip is\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nIf the white and yolk are used separately, break the shells gently about\r\nthe middle, opening slowly so as to let the white fall into the dish,\r\nwhile retaining the yolk in one half of the shell. If part of the white\r\nremains, turn the yolk from the one half to the other till the white has\r\nfallen. Beat the yolks until they change from their natural orange color\r\nto a much lighter yellow. The whites should be beaten until firm and dry\r\nenough not to fall from the bowl if turned upside down. The yolk should\r\nalways be beaten first, since, if the white is left to stand after being\r\nbeaten, a portion of the air, which its viscous nature allows it to\r\ncatch up, escapes and no amount of beating will render it so firm a\r\nsecond time. Eggs which need to be washed before breaking should always\r\nbe wiped perfectly dry, that no water may become mingled with the egg,\r\nas the water may dilute the albumen sufficiently to prevent the white\r\nfrom becoming firm and stiff when beaten.\r\n\r\nIn cold weather, it is sometimes difficult to beat the whites as stiff\r\nas desirable. Albumen is quite susceptible to temperature, and this\r\ndifficulty may be overcome by setting the dish in which the eggs are\r\nbeaten into warm water--not hot by any means--during the process of\r\nbeating. In very hot weather it is often advantageous to leave the eggs\r\nin cold or ice water for a short time before beating. When a number of\r\neggs are to be used, always break each by itself into a saucer, so that\r\nany chance stale egg may not spoil the whole. If the white or yolk of an\r\negg--is left over, it may be kept for a day or two if put in a cool\r\nplace, the yolk thoroughly beaten, the white unbeaten.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nEGGS IN SHELL.--The usual method of preparing eggs for serving in\r\nthis way is to put them into boiling water, and boil or simmer until\r\nthey are considered sufficiently cooked. Albumen, of which the white of\r\nthe egg is composed, is easiest digested when simply coagulated. The\r\nyolk, if cooked at all, is easiest digested when dry and mealy. Albumen\r\ncoagulates at 160°, and when the boiling point is reached, it becomes\r\nhardened, tough, and leathery, and very difficult of digestion. If the\r\negg were all albumen, it might be easily and properly cooked by dropping\r\ninto boiling water, allowing it to remain for a few seconds, and\r\nremoving it, since the shell of the egg would prevent its becoming\r\nsufficiently heated in so short a time as to become hardened; but the\r\ntime necessary to cook properly the white of the egg would be\r\ninsufficient for the heat to penetrate to and cook the yolk; and if it\r\nis desirable to cook the yolk hard, the cooking process should be\r\ncarried on at a temperature below the boiling point, subjecting the egg\r\nto a less degree of heat, but for a longer time. The most accurate\r\nmethod is to put the eggs into water of a temperature of 160°, allowing\r\nthem to remain for twenty minutes and not permitting the temperature of\r\nthe water to go above 165°. Cooked in this way, the white will be of a\r\nsoft, jelly-like consistency throughout, while the yolks will be hard.\r\nIf it is desired to have the yolks dry and mealy, the temperature of the\r\nwater must be less, and the time of cooking lengthened. We have secured\r\nthe most perfect results with water at a temperature of 150°, and seven\r\nhours' cooking. The temperature of the water can be easily tested by\r\nkeeping in it an ordinary thermometer, and if one possesses a kerosene\r\nor gas stove, the heat can be easily regulated to maintain the required\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nAnother method, although less sure, is to pour boiling water into a\r\nsaucepan, draw it to one side of the range where it will keep hot, but\r\nnot boil, put in the eggs, cover, and let stand for twenty minutes. If\r\nby either method it is desired to have the yolk soft-cooked, lessen the\r\ntime to ten minutes or so, according to the hardness desired. Eggs are\r\nbest served as soon as done, as the white becomes more solid by being\r\nkept in a hot shell.\r\n\r\nIt should be remarked that the time necessary to cook eggs in the shell\r\nwill vary somewhat with the firmness of the shell, the size of the eggs,\r\nand the number cooked together.\r\n\r\nEGGS IN SUNSHINE.--Take an earthen-ware dish which will stand heat\r\nand also do to use in serving the eggs. Oil it and break therein as many\r\neggs as desired; sprinkle lightly with salt, and put into the oven for\r\ntwo or more minutes till the eggs are set. Have ready some hot tomato\r\nsauce prepared as for Tomato Toast; pour the sauce over them, and serve.\r\n\r\nEGGS POACHED IN TOMATOES.--Take a pint of stewed tomatoes, cooked\r\nuntil they are homogeneous or which have been rubbed through a colander;\r\nseason with salt if desired, and heat. When just beginning to boil, slip\r\nin gently a half dozen eggs, the shells of which have been so carefully\r\nbroken that the yolks are intact. Keep the tomato just below the boiling\r\npoint until the eggs are cooked. Lift the whites carefully with a fork\r\nas they cook, until they are firm, then prick them and let the yellow\r\nmix with the tomato and the whites. The whole should be quite soft when\r\ndone, but showing the red of the tomatoes and the white and yellow of\r\nthe eggs quite distinctly. Serve on toast. If the flavor is agreeable, a\r\nlittle onion.\r\n\r\nEGGS IN CREAM.--Put a half cupful or more of cream into a shallow\r\nearthen dish, and place the dish in a kettle or pan of boiling water.\r\nWhen the cream is hot, break in as many eggs as the bottom of the dish\r\nwill hold, and cook until well set, basting them occasionally over the\r\ntop with the hot cream. Or, put a spoonful or two of cream into\r\nindividual egg or vegetable dishes, break a fresh egg in each, and cook\r\nin the oven or in a steamer over a kettle of boiling water until the\r\nwhite of the egg is well set.\r\n\r\nPOACHED OR DROPPED EGGS.--Break each egg into a saucer by itself.\r\nHave a shallow pan half filled with scalding, not boiling, water on the\r\nstove. If desired, a little salt and a tablespoonful of lemon juice may\r\nbe added. Slip the eggs gently from the saucer upon the top of the\r\nwater, holding the edge of the saucer under water to prevent the eggs\r\nfrom scattering; dip the water over them with a spoon and let them stand\r\nfive minutes, or until the yolk is covered with a film, and the white is\r\nfirm but not hardened; keep the water just below the boiling point. Take\r\nout the eggs one by one on a skimmer, and serve in egg-saucers, or on\r\nslices of nicely browned toast moistened with a little sweet cream, as\r\npreferred. If one is especially particular to keep the shape of the\r\neggs, an egg poacher should be used, or a set of muffin-rings may be\r\nlaid in the bottom of the pan, and the eggs turned into the rings.\r\n\r\nPOACHED EGGS WITH CREAM SAUCE.--Poach eggs as in the foregoing, and\r\npour over them a sauce made according to direction on page 351.\r\n\r\nQUICKLY PREPARED EGGS.--A good way to cook quickly a large number\r\nof eggs, is to use a large-bottomed earthen dish, which will stand the\r\nheat and in which the eggs may be served. Oil it well; break the\r\nrequisite number of eggs separately, and turn each carefully into the\r\ndish; sprinkle lightly with salt; set the dish in the oven or in a\r\nsteamer over a kettle of boiling water for a few minutes until the eggs\r\nare set, then serve.\r\n\r\nSCRAMBLED EGGS.--Beat four eggs lightly, add a little salt if\r\ndesired, and half a cup of milk or cream. Have ready a hot, oiled\r\nsaucepan; turn the eggs in and cook quickly, stirring constantly until\r\nfirm, but soft.\r\n\r\nSTEAMED EGGS.--Break eggs into egg or vegetable dishes or\r\npatty-pans, salt very lightly, and set in a steamer over a kettle of\r\nboiling water until the whites are set and a film has formed over the\r\nyolk. Serve the same as poached eggs, with or without toast.\r\n\r\nWHIRLED EGGS.--Have a small kettle of water heated almost to\r\nboiling, and with a wooden spoon, stir it rapidly round and round in the\r\nsame direction until a miniature whirlpool is produced. Have ready some\r\neggs broken in separate cups, and drop them carefully one at a time into\r\nthe whirling water, the stirring of which must be kept up until the egg\r\nis a soft round ball. Remove with a skimmer, and serve on cream toast.\r\n\r\n\r\nOMELETS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nPLAIN OMELET.--Beat the yolks of three eggs to a cream and beat the\r\nwhites to a stiff froth. Add to the yolks three tablespoonfuls of milk\r\nor cream, one tablespoonful of finely grated bread crumbs, and season\r\nlightly with salt; lastly, fold, not stir, the whites lightly in. An\r\nomelet pan is the best utensil for cooking, but if that is not to be\r\nhad, an earthen-ware pudding dish which will stand the heat is good; an\r\niron spider will do, but a larger omelet would need to be prepared. A\r\ntin saucepan is apt to cook the omelet so rapidly as to burn it in\r\nspots. Whatever the utensil used, it should be hot, the fire clear and\r\nsteady, and all in readiness by the time the eggs are beaten.\r\n\r\nOil the dish well and gently pour in the omelet mixture; cover, and\r\nplace the pan on the range where the heat will be continuous. Do not\r\nstir, but carefully, as the egg sets, lift the omelet occasionally by\r\nslipping a broad-bladed knife under it, or with a fork by dipping in\r\nhere and there. It should cook quickly, but not so quickly as to burn.\r\nFrom three to five minutes will generally be ample time. When the middle\r\nof the omelet is set, it may be put into a hot oven to dry the top. As\r\nsoon as the center is dry, it should be removed immediately, as it will\r\nbe hard and indigestible if overdone. To dish, loosen from the pan by\r\nrunning a knife under it, lay a hot platter, bottom upward, over the\r\npan, and invert the latter so as to shake out the omelet gently, browned\r\nside uppermost; or if preferred, double one part over the other before\r\ndishing. Serve at once, or it will fall.\r\n\r\nAn omelet of three eggs is sufficient for two or three persons; if more\r\nis desired, a second omelet of three eggs may be made. Larger ones are\r\nnot so light nor so easily prepared. The dish used should be reserved\r\nfor that purpose alone, and should be kept as smooth and dry as\r\npossible. It is better to keep it clean by wiping with a coarse towel\r\nthan by washing; if the omelet comes from the pan perfectly whole and\r\nleaving no fragments behind.\r\n\r\nFOAM OMELET.--Prepare as above, leaving out the white of one egg,\r\nwhich must be beaten to a stiff froth and spread over the top of the\r\nomelet after it is well set. Let this white just heat through by the\r\ntime the omelet is done. Fold the omelet together, and dish. The whites\r\nwill burst out around the edges like a border of foam.\r\n\r\nFANCY OMELETS.--Various fancy omelets may be made by adding other\r\ningredients and preparing the same as for plain omelets. Two or three\r\ntablespoonfuls of orange juice instead of milk, with a little grated\r\nrind for flavor and three tablespoonfuls of sugar, may be combined with\r\nthe eggs and called an orange omelet.\r\n\r\nA little cold cauliflower or cooked asparagus chopped very fine and\r\nmixed in when the omelet is ready for the pan, may be denominated a\r\nvegetable omelet.\r\n\r\nSOFT OMELET.--Beat together thoroughly one quart of milk and six\r\neggs. Season with salt. Pour into a shallow earthen pudding dish, and\r\nbake in the oven until well set.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE TOPICS.\r\n\r\n    The candidates for ancient athletic games were dieted on boiled\r\n    grain, with warm water, cheese, dried figs, but no meat.\r\n\r\n    An unpleasant reminder.--(Scene, Thanksgiving dinner, everybody\r\n    commenting on the immense size of the turkey.) An appalling silence\r\n    fell upon the crowd when Tommy cried out, \"Mamma, is that the old\r\n    sore-headed turkey?\"\r\n\r\n    The eminent Prof. Wilder was reared a vegetarian, having passed his\r\n    earlier years without even knowing that flesh food was ever eaten by\r\n    human beings. When six years old, he saw on the table for the first\r\n    time, a roasted chicken, at which he gazed for some moments in great\r\n    bewilderment, when he seemed to make a discovery, and in his\r\n    astonishment burst out with the remark, \"I'll bet that's a dead\r\n    hen!\"\r\n\r\n    A story is told of a minister who was spending the day in the\r\n    country, and was invited to dine. There was chicken for dinner, much\r\n    to the grief of a little boy of the household, who had lost his\r\n    favorite hen to provide for the feast. After dinner, prayer was\r\n    proposed, and while the preacher was praying, a poor little lonesome\r\n    chicken came running under the house, crying for its absent mother.\r\n    The little boy shouted, \"Peepy! Peepy! I didn't kill your mother!\r\n    They killed her for that big preacher's dinner!\" The \"Amen\" was said\r\n    very suddenly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEATS\r\n\r\nThis is the term usually applied to the flesh and various organs of such\r\nanimals, poultry, and game as are used for food. This class of foods\r\ncontains representatives of all nutritive elements, but is especially\r\ncharacterized by as excess of albuminous matter. But in actual nutritive\r\nvalue flesh foods do not exceed various other food materials. A\r\ncomparison of the food grains with beefsteak and other flesh foods,\r\nshows, in fact, that a pound of grain is equivalent in food value to two\r\nor three pounds of flesh.\r\n\r\nAt present time there is much question in the minds of many intelligent,\r\nthinking people as to the propriety of using foods of this class, and\r\nespecially of their frequent use. Besides being in no way superior to\r\nvegetable substances, they contain elements of an excrementitious\r\ncharacter, which cannot be utilized, and which serve only to clog and\r\nimpede the vital processes, rendering the blood gross, filling the body\r\nwith second-hand waste material which was working its way out of the\r\nvital domain of the animal when slaughtered. To this waste matter,\r\nconsisting of unexpelled excretions, are added those produced by the\r\nputrefactive processes which so quickly begin in flesh foods exposed to\r\nair and warmth.\r\n\r\nThat flesh foods are stimulating has been shown by many observations and\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nFlesh foods are also specially liable to be diseased and to communicate\r\nto the consumer the same disease. The prevalence of disease among\r\nanimals used for food is known to be very great, and their transmission\r\nto man is no longer a matter of dispute. It has been abundantly proved\r\nthat such diseases as the parasitic, tuberculous, erysipelatous, and\r\nfoot and mouth diseases are most certainly communicable to man by\r\ninfected flesh. All stall and sty fed animals are more or less diseased.\r\nShut up in the dark, cut off from exercise, the whole fattening process\r\nis one of progressive disease. No living creature could long retain good\r\nhealth under such unnatural and unwholesome conditions. Add to this the\r\nexhaustion and abuse of animals before slaughtering; the suffering\r\nincident to long journeys in close cars, often without sufficient food\r\nand water; and long drives over dusty roads under a burning sun to the\r\nslaughter house, and it will be apparent to all thoughtful persons that\r\nsuch influences are extremely liable to produce conditions of the system\r\nthat render the flesh unfit for food.\r\n\r\nThousands of animals are consumed each year which were slaughtered just\r\nin time to save them from dying a natural death. It is a common thing\r\nfor cattle owners, as soon as an animal shows symptoms of decline, to\r\nsend it to the butcher at once; and when epidemics of cattle diseases\r\nare prevalent, there can be no doubt that the meat markets are flooded\r\nwith diseased flesh.\r\n\r\nThere are few ways in which we can more effectually imperil our health\r\nthan in partaking freely of diseased animal food. This is no new theory.\r\nThe Jews have for ages recognized this danger, and their laws require\r\nthe most careful examination of all animals to be used as food, both\r\nbefore and after slaughtering. Their sanitary regulations demand that\r\nbeast or fowl for food must be killed by bleeding through the jugular\r\nvein, and not, according to custom, by striking on the head, or in some\r\nviolent way. Prior to the killing, the animal must be well rested and\r\nits respiration normal; after death the most careful dissection and\r\nexamination of the various parts are made by a competent person, and no\r\nflesh is allowed to be used for food which has not been inspected and\r\nfound to be perfectly sound and healthy. As a result, it is found in\r\nmany of our large cities that only about one in twenty of the animals\r\nslaughtered is accepted as food for a Jew. The rejected animals are sold\r\nto the general public, who are less scrupulous about the character of\r\ntheir food, and who are in consequence more subject to disease and\r\nshorter-lived than are Jews.\r\n\r\nTrichinæ, tapeworms, and various other parasites which infest the flesh\r\nof animals, are so common that there is always more or less liability to\r\ndisease from these sources among consumers of flesh foods.\r\n\r\nMeat is by no means necessary for the proper maintenance of life or\r\nvigorous health, as is proved by the fact that at least \"four tenths of\r\nthe human race,\" according to Virey, \"subsist exclusively upon a\r\nvegetable diet, and as many as seven tenths are practically\r\nvegetarians.\" Some of the finest specimens of physical development and\r\nmental vigor are to be found among those who use very little or no\r\nanimal food. Says St. Pierre, a noted French author, \"The people living\r\nupon vegetable foods are of all men the handsomest, the most vigorous,\r\nthe lease exposed to disease and passion; and they are those whose lives\r\nlast longest.\"\r\n\r\nThe use of large quantities of animal food, however free from disease\r\ngerms, has a tendency to develop the animal propensities to a greater or\r\nless degree, especially in the young, whose characters are unformed.\r\nAmong animals we find the carnivorous the most vicious and destructive,\r\nwhile those which subsist upon vegetable foods are by nature gentle and\r\ntractable. There is little doubt that this law holds good among men as\r\nwell as animals. If we study the character and lives of those who\r\nsubsist largely upon animal food, we are apt to find them impatient,\r\npassionate, fiery in temper, and in other respects greatly under the\r\ndominion of their lower natures.\r\n\r\nThere are many other objections to the use of this class of foods--so\r\nmany in fact that we believe the human race would be far healthier,\r\nbetter, and happier if flesh foods were wholly discarded. If, however,\r\nthey are to be used at all, let them be used sparingly and prepared in\r\nthe simplest and least harmful manner. Let them be cooked and served in\r\ntheir own juices, not soaked in butter or other oils, or disguised by\r\nthe free use of pepper, mustard, catsup, and other pungent sauces. Salt\r\nalso should be used only in the smallest possible quantities, as it\r\nhardens the fiber, rendering it more difficult of digestion.\r\n\r\nWe can conceive of no possible stretch of hygienic laws which admits the\r\nuse of pork; so we shall give it and its products no consideration in\r\nour pages.\r\n\r\nSuch offal as calves' brains, sheep's kidneys, beef livers, and other\r\nviscera, is not fit food for any one but a scavenger. The liver and\r\nkidneys are depurating organs, and their use as food is not only\r\nunwholesome but often exceedingly poisonous.\r\n\r\nMeat pies, scallops, sauces, fricassees, _pâtés_, and other fancy dishes\r\ncomposed of a mixture of animal foods, rich pastry, fats, strong\r\ncondiments, etc., are by no means to be recommended as hygienic, and\r\nwill receive no notice in these pages.\r\n\r\nIn comparative nutritive value, beef ranks first among the flesh foods.\r\nMutton, though less nutritive, is more easily digested than beef. This\r\nis not appreciable to a healthy person, but one whose digestive powers\r\nare weak will often find that mutton taxes the stomach less than beef.\r\n\r\nVeal or lamb is neither so nutritious nor so easily digested as beef or\r\nmutton. Flesh from different animals, and that from various parts of the\r\nsame animal, varies in flavor, composition, and digestibility. The mode\r\nof life and the food of animals influence in a marked manner the quality\r\nof the meat. Turnips give a distinctly recognizable flavor to mutton.\r\nThe same is true of many fragrant herbs found by cattle feeding in\r\npastures.\r\n\r\nTHE SELECTION OF MEAT.--Good beef is of a reddish-brown color and\r\ncontains no clots of blood. A pale-pink color indicates that the animal\r\nwas diseased; a dark-purple color that the animal has suffered from some\r\nacute febrile affection or was not slaughtered, but died with the blood\r\nin its body.\r\n\r\nGood beef is firm and elastic to the touch; when pressed with the\r\nfinger, no impression is left. It should be so dry upon the surface as\r\nscarcely to moisten the fingers. Meat that is wet, sodden, and flabby\r\nshould not be eaten. Good beef is marbled with spots of white fat. The\r\nsuet should be dry and crumble easily. If the fat has the appearance of\r\nwet parchment or is jelly-like, the beef is not good. Yellow fat is an\r\nindication of old, lean animals.\r\n\r\nGood beef has little or no odor. If any odor is perceptible, it is not\r\ndisagreeable. Diseased meat has a sickly odor, resembling the breath of\r\nfeverish persons. When such meat is roasted, it emits a strong,\r\noffensive smell. The condition of a piece of beef may be ascertained by\r\ndipping a knife in hot water, drying it, and passing it through the\r\nmeat. Apply to the nose on withdrawal, and if the meat is not good, a\r\ndisagreeable odor will be quite perceptible.\r\n\r\nGood beef will not shrink greatly in cooking. In boiling or stewing, the\r\nshrinkage is computed to be about one pound in four; in baking, one and\r\none fourth pounds in four. Beef of a close, firm fiber shrinks less than\r\nmeat of coarse fiber.\r\n\r\nGood veal is slightly reddish or pink, and the fat should be white and\r\nclear. Avoid veal without fat, as such is apt to be too young to be\r\nwholesome.\r\n\r\nGood mutton should be firm and compact, the flesh, fine-grained and\r\nbright-red, with an accumulation of very hard and clear white fat along\r\nthe borders of the muscles.\r\n\r\nMeat should not be kept until decomposition sets in, as by the\r\nputrefaction of the albuminous elements certain organic poisons are\r\ngenerated, and flesh partaken of in this condition is liable to result\r\nin serious illness. Meat containing white specks is probably infested by\r\nparasites and should not be used as food.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF MEAT.--The tendency of flesh foods to rapid\r\ndecomposition has led to the use of various antiseptic agents and other\r\nmethods for its preservation.\r\n\r\nOne of the most common methods is that of immersion in a brine made of a\r\nsolution of common salt to which a small portion of saltpeter has been\r\nadded. This abstracts the juice from the meat and also lessens the\r\ntendency to putrefaction. Salt is used in various other ways for\r\npreserving meat. It should be remarked, however, that cured and dried\r\nmeats are much more difficult to digest than fresh meat, and the nature\r\nof the meat itself is so changed by the process as to render its\r\nnutritive value much less.\r\n\r\nMeat is sometimes packed in salt and afterward dried, either in the sun\r\nor in a current of dry air. Both salting and smoking are sometimes\r\nemployed. By these means the juices are abstracted by the salt, and at\r\nthe same time the flesh is contracted and hardened by the action of\r\ncreosote and pyroligneous acid from the smoke.\r\n\r\nWhat is termed \"jerked\" beef is prepared by drying in a current of warm\r\nair at about 140°. This dried meat, when reduced to a powder and packed\r\nin air-tight cans, may be preserved for a long time. When mixed with\r\nfat, it forms the pemmican used by explorers in Arctic voyages.\r\n\r\nMeat is also preserved by cooking and inclosing in air-tight cans after\r\nthe manner of canning fruit. This process is varied in a number of ways.\r\n\r\nThe application of cold has great influence in retarding decomposition,\r\nand refrigeration and freezing are often employed for the preservation\r\nof flesh foods.\r\n\r\nAll of these methods except the last are open to the objection that\r\nwhile they preserve the meat, they greatly lessen its nutritive value.\r\nIt should also be understood that the decomposition of its flesh begins\r\nalmost the moment an animal dies, and continues at a slow rate even when\r\nthe flesh is kept at a low temperature. The poisons resulting from this\r\ndecomposition are often deadly, and are always detrimental to health.\r\n\r\nTHE PREPARATION AND COOKING OF MEAT.--Meat, when brought from the\r\nmarket, should be at once removed from the paper in which it is wrapped,\r\nas the paper will absorb the juices of the meat; and if the wrapping is\r\nbrown paper, the meat is liable to taste of it. Joints of meat should\r\nnot be hung with the cut surface down, as the juices will be wasted.\r\n\r\nMeat kept in a refrigerator should not be placed directly on the ice,\r\nbut always upon plates or shelves, as the ice will freeze it or else\r\ndraw out its juices.\r\n\r\nIf meat is accidentally frozen, it should be thoroughly thawed in cold\r\nwater before cutting. Meat should not be cleaned by washing with water,\r\nas that extracts the nutritive juices, but by thoroughly wiping the\r\noutside with a damp cloth. The inside needs no cleaning.\r\n\r\nMeat may be cooked by any of the different methods of cookery,--boiling,\r\nsteaming, stewing, roasting, broiling, baking, etc.,--according as the\r\nobject is to retain the nutriment wholly within the meat; to draw it all\r\nout into the water, as in soups or broths; or to have it partly in the\r\nwater and partly in the meat, as in stews. Broiling is, however,\r\ngenerally conceded to be the most wholesome method, but something will\r\nnecessarily depend upon the quality of the meat to be cooked.\r\n\r\nMeat which has a tough, hard fiber will be made tenderest by slow,\r\ncontinuous cooking, as stewing. Such pieces as contain a large amount of\r\ngelatine--a peculiar substance found in the joints and gristly parts of\r\nmeat, and which hardens in a dry heat--are better stewed than roasted.\r\n\r\nBOILING.--The same principles apply to the boiling of all kinds of\r\nmeats. The purpose to be attained by this method is to keep the\r\nnutritive juices so far as possible intact within the meat;\r\nconsequently, the piece to be cooked should be left whole, so that only\r\na small amount of surface will be exposed to the action of the water.\r\nSince cold water extracts albumen, of which the juices of the meat are\r\nlargely composed, while hot water coagulates it, meat to be boiled\r\nshould be plunged into boiling water sufficient to cover it and kept\r\nthere for five or ten minutes, by which time the albumen over the entire\r\nsurface will have become hardened, thus forming a coat through which\r\nthe juices cannot escape. Afterward the kettle, closely covered, may be\r\nset aside where the water will retain a temperature of about 180°. A\r\nsmall portion of albumen from the outer surface will escape into the\r\nwater in the form of scum, and should be removed.\r\n\r\nMeat cooked in this way will require a longer time than when the water\r\nis kept boiling furiously, but it is superior in every respect and more\r\ndigestible. Something depends upon the shape of the piece cooked, thin\r\npieces requiring less time than a thick, cubical cut; but approximately,\r\nfirst allowing fifteen or twenty minutes for the heat to penetrate the\r\ncenter of the meat, at which time the real process of cooking begins, it\r\nwill require from twelve to fifteen minutes for every pound cooked.\r\n\r\nSTEWING.--While the object in boiling is to preserve the juices\r\nwithin the meat as much as possible, in stewing, the process is largely\r\nreversed; the juices are to be partly extracted. Some of the juices\r\nexist between the fibers, and some are found within the fibers. The\r\ngreater the surface exposed, the more easily these juices will be\r\nextracted; hence meat for stewing should be cut into small pieces and\r\ncooked in a small quantity of water. Since cold water extracts the\r\nalbuminous juices, while boiling water hardens them into a leathery\r\nconsistency, water used for stewing should be neither cold nor boiling,\r\nbut of a temperature which will barely coagulate the albumen and retain\r\nit in the meat in as tender a condition as possible; _i.e.,_ about 134°\r\nto 160°. To supply this temperature for the prolonged process of cooking\r\nnecessary in stewing, a double boiler of some form is quite necessary.\r\nPut the pieces of meat to be stewed in the inner dish, add hot water\r\nenough to cover, fill the outer boiler with hot water, and let this\r\nouter water simmer very gently until the meat is perfectly tender. The\r\nlength of time required will be greater than when meat is stewed\r\ndirectly in simmering water, but the result will be much more\r\nsatisfactory. The juices should be served with the meat.\r\n\r\nSTEAMING.--Meat is sometimes steamed over boiling water until it\r\nis made very tender and afterward browned in the oven.\r\n\r\nAnother method of steaming, sometimes called smothering, is that of\r\ncooking meat in a tightly covered jar in a moderate oven for an hour\r\n(the moderate heat serves to draw out the juice of the meat), after\r\nwhich the heat is increased, and the meat cooked in its own juices one\r\nhalf hour for each pound.\r\n\r\nROASTING.--This method, which consists in placing meat upon a\r\nrevolving spit and cooking it before an open fire, is much less employed\r\nnow than formerly, when fireplaces were in general use. What is\r\nordinarily termed roasting is in reality cooking meat it in own juices\r\nin a hot oven. In cooking meat by this method it is always desirable to\r\nretain the juices entirely within the meat, which can be best\r\naccomplished by first placing the clean-cut sides of the meat upon a\r\nsmoking-hot pan over a quick fire; press the meat close to the pan until\r\nwell scared and slightly browned, then turn over and sear the opposite\r\nside in the same manner. This will form a coating of hardened albumen,\r\nthrough which the interior juices cannot escape. Put at once into the\r\noven, arrange the fire so that the heat will be firm and steady but not\r\ntoo intense, and cook undisturbed until tender.\r\n\r\nBasting is not necessary if the roast is carefully seared and the oven\r\nkept at proper temperature. When the heat of the oven is just right, the\r\nmeat will keep up a continuous gentle sputtering in the pan. If no\r\nsputtering can be heard, the heat is insufficient. The heat is too great\r\nwhen the drippings burn and smoke.\r\n\r\nBROILING.--This is the method employed for cooking thin cuts of\r\nmeat in their own juices over glowing coals. When properly done, broiled\r\nmeat contains a larger amount of uncoagulated albumen than can be\r\nsecured by cooking in any other manner; hence it is the most wholesome.\r\nFor broiling, a bed of clear, glowing coals without flame is the first\r\nessential. Coke, charcoal, or anthracite coal serves best for securing\r\nthis requisite.\r\n\r\nIn an ordinary stove, the coals should be nearly to the top of the\r\nfire-box, that the meat may be held so as almost to touch the fire. No\r\nutensil is better for ordinary purposes than a double wire broiler.\r\nFirst, rub it well with a bit of suet, then put in the meat with the\r\nthickest part in the center. Wrap a coarse towel around the hand to\r\nprotect it from the heat, hold the meat as near the fire as possible, so\r\nas to sear one side instantly, slowly count ten, then turn and sear the\r\nother side. Continue the process, alternating first one side and then\r\nthe other, slowly counting ten before each turning, until the meat is\r\nsufficiently done. Successful broiling is largely dependent upon\r\nfrequent turning. The heat, while it at once sears the surface, starts\r\nthe flow of the juices, and although they cannot escape through the\r\nhardened surface, if the meat were entirely cooked on one side before\r\nturning, they would soon come to the top, and when it was turned over,\r\nwould drip into the fire. If the meat is seared on both sides, the\r\njuices will be retained within, unless the broiling is too prolonged,\r\nwhen they will ooze out and evaporate, leaving the meat dry and\r\nleathery. Salt draws out the juices, and should not be added until the\r\nmeat is done. As long as meat retains its juices, it will spring up\r\ninstantly when pressed with a knife; when the juices have begun to\r\nevaporate, it will cease to do this. Broiled meats should be served on\r\nhot dishes.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEEF.\r\n\r\nECONOMY AND ADAPTABILITY IN SELECTION.--While the greatest care\r\nshould be exercised in the selection of beef as regards its soundness\r\nand wholesomeness, it must likewise be selected with reference to\r\neconomy and adaptability for cooking purposes, pieces from different\r\nportions of the animal being suitable for cooking only in certain ways.\r\nOx beef is said to be best. That beef is most juicy and tender which has\r\nfine streaks of fat intermingled with the lean. Beef which is\r\ncoarse-grained and hard to cut is apt to be tough. An economical piece\r\nof beef to purchase is the back of the rump. It is a long piece with\r\nonly a small portion of bone, and weighs about ten pounds. The thickest\r\nportion may be cut into steaks, the thin, end with bone may be utilized\r\nfor soups and stews, while the remainder will furnish a good roast. Only\r\na small portion of choice tender lean meat is to be found in one animal,\r\nand these are also the most expensive; but the tougher, cheaper parts,\r\nif properly cooked, are nearly as nutritious.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nBROILED BEEF.--Beef for broiling should be juicy and have a tender\r\nfiber. Steaks cut from three parts of the beef are in request for this\r\npurpose,--tenderloin, porterhouse, and round steak. The last-named is\r\nthe more common and economical, yet it is inferior in juice and\r\ntenderness to the other two. Steak should be cut three fourths of an\r\ninch or more in thickness. If it is of the right quality, do not pound\r\nit; if very tough, beat with a steak-mallet or cut across it several\r\ntimes on both sides with a sharp knife. Wipe, and remove any bone and\r\nsuperfluous fat. Have the fire in readiness, the plates heating, then\r\nproceed as directed on page 398.\r\n\r\nCOLD-MEAT STEW.--Cut pieces of cold roast beef into thick slices\r\nand put into a stewpan with six or eight potatoes, a good-sized bunch of\r\ncelery cut into small pieces; and a small carrot cut in dice may be\r\nadded if the flavor is liked. Cover with hot water, and simmer for three\r\nfourths of an hour. Thicken with a little browned flour.\r\n\r\nPAN-BROILED STEAK.--In the absence of the necessary appliances for\r\nbroiling over coals, the following method may be employed. Heat a clean\r\nskillet to blue heat, rub it with a bit of suet, just enough to keep the\r\nmeat from sticking, but leave no fat in the pan. Lay in the steak,\r\npressing it down to the pan, and sear quickly on one side; turn, and\r\nwithout cutting into the meat, sear upon the other. Keep the skillet hot\r\nbut do not scorch; cook from five to ten minutes, turning frequently, so\r\nas not to allow the juices to escape. Add no salt until done. Serve on\r\nhot plates. This method is not frying, and requires the addition of no\r\nwater, butter, or stock.\r\n\r\nPAN-BROILED STEAK NO.2.--Take a smooth pancake-griddle, or in lieu\r\nof anything better, a clean stove-griddle may be used; heat very hot and\r\nsear each side of the steak upon it. When well seared, lift the steak\r\ninto a hot granite-ware or sheet-iron pan, cover, and put into a hot\r\noven for two or three minutes, or until sufficiently cooked.\r\n\r\nROAST BEEF.--The sirloin and rib and rump pieces are the best cuts\r\nfor roasting. Wipe, trim, and skewer into shape. Sear the cut surfaces\r\nand proceed as directed on page 397, cooking twenty minutes to the\r\npound if it is to be rare, less half an hour deducted on account of\r\nsoaring. The application of salt and water has a tendency to toughen the\r\nmeat and draw out its juices; so if it is desired to have the meat juicy\r\nand tender, it is better to cook without basting. Unless the heat of the\r\noven is allowed to become too great, when meat is cooked after this\r\nmanner there will be a quantity of rich, jelly-like material in the pan,\r\nwhich with the addition of a little water and flour may be made into a\r\ngravy.\r\n\r\nSMOTHERED BEEF.--Portions from the round, middle, or face of the\r\nrump are generally considered best for preparing this dish. Wipe with a\r\nclean wet cloth, put into a smoking-hot skillet, and carefully sear all\r\ncut surfaces. Put into a kettle, adding for a piece of beef weighing\r\nabout six pounds, one cup of hot water. Cover closely and cook at a\r\ntemperature just below boiling, until the meat is tender but not broken.\r\nAs the water boils away, enough more boiling water may be added to keep\r\nthe meat from burning. Another method of securing the same results is to\r\ncut the beef into small pieces and put into a moderate oven inside a\r\ntightly covered jar for an hour. Afterward increase the heat and cook\r\nclosely covered until the meat is tender. Thicken and season the juice,\r\nand serve as a gravy.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLES WITH STEWED BEEF.--Prepare the beef as directed for\r\nStewed Beef, and when nearly tender, add six or eight potatoes. Just\r\nbefore serving, thicken the gravy with a little browned flour braided in\r\ncold water, and add a cup of strained, stewed tomato and a teaspoonful\r\nof chopped parsley.\r\n\r\nSTEWED BEEF.--The aitch-bone and pieces from the shin, the upper\r\npart of the chuck-rib and neck of beef, are the parts most commonly used\r\nfor stewing. All meat for stews should be carefully dressed and free\r\nfrom blood. Those portions which have bone and fat, as well as lean\r\nbeef, make much better-flavored stews than pieces which are wholly lean.\r\nThe bones, however, should not be crushed or splintered, but carefully\r\nsawed or broken, and any small pieces removed before cooking. It is\r\ngenerally considered that beef which has been previously browned makes a\r\nmuch more savory stew, and it is quite customary first to brown the meat\r\nby frying in hot fat. A much more wholesome method, and one which will\r\nhave the same effect as to flavor, is to add to the stew the remnants of\r\nroasts or steak. It is well when selecting meat for a stew to procure a\r\nportion, which, like the aitch-bone, has enough juicy meat upon it to\r\nserve the first day as a roast for a small family. Cut the meat for a\r\nstew into small pieces suitable for serving, add boiling water, and cook\r\nas directed on page 396. Remove all pieces of bone and the fat before\r\nserving. If the stew is made of part cooked and part uncooked meat, the\r\ncooked meat should not be added until the stew is nearly done. The\r\nliquor, if not of the proper consistency when the meat is tender, may be\r\nthickened by adding a little flour braided in cold water, cooking these\r\nafter four or five minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUTTON.\r\n\r\nThe strong flavor of mutton is said to be due to the oil from the wool,\r\nwhich penetrates the skin, or is the result, through heedlessness or\r\nignorance of the butcher, in allowing the wool to come in contact with\r\nthe flesh. There is a quite perceptible difference in the flavor of\r\nmutton from a sheep which had been for some time sheared of its woolly\r\ncoat and that from one having a heavy fleece.\r\n\r\nThe smallest proportion of both fat and bone to muscle is found in the\r\nleg; consequently this is the most valuable portion for food, and is\r\nlikewise the most economical, being available for many savory dishes. On\r\naccount of the disagreeable adhesive qualities of its fat when cold,\r\nmutton should always be served hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nBOILED LEG OF MUTTON.--Wipe carefully, remove the fat, and put into\r\nboiling water. Skim, and cook as directed on page 395, twelve minutes\r\nfor each pound.\r\n\r\nBROILED CHOPS.--The best-flavored and most tender chops are those\r\nfrom the loins. Remove carefully all the pink skin above the fat,\r\nscraping it off if possible without cutting into the lean. Wipe with a\r\nwet cloth, and broil in the same manner as beefsteak over hot coals or\r\nin a hot skillet, turning frequently until done; five or eight minutes\r\nwill suffice to cook. Sprinkle salt on each side, drain on paper, and\r\nserve hot.\r\n\r\nPOT-ROAST LAMB.--For this purpose a stone jar or pot is best,\r\nalthough iron or granite-ware will do; wipe the meat well and gash with\r\na sharp knife. If crowded closely in the pot, all the better; cover with\r\na lid pressed down firmly with a weight to hold it if it does not fit\r\ntightly. No water is needed, and no steam should be allowed to escape\r\nduring the cooking. Roast four or five hours in a moderate oven.\r\n\r\nROAST MUTTON.--The best pieces for this purpose are those obtained\r\nfrom the shoulder, and saddle, loin, and haunches. Wipe carefully, sear\r\nthe cut surfaces, and proceed as directed for roasting beef. Cook slowly\r\nwithout basting, and unless desired rare, allow twenty-five or thirty\r\nminutes to the pound. A leg of mutton requires a longer time to roast\r\nthan a shoulder. When sufficiently roasted, remove from the pan and\r\ndrain off all the grease.\r\n\r\nSTEWED MUTTON.--Pieces from the neck and shoulder are most suitable\r\nfor this purpose. Prepare the meat, and stew as directed for beef,\r\nalthough less time is usually required.\r\n\r\nSTEWED MUTTON CHOP.--Wipe, trim off the fat, and remove the bone\r\nfrom two or three pounds of chops. Put into the inner dish of a double\r\nboiler with just enough hot water to cover; add a minced stalk of\r\ncelery, a carrot, and a white turnip cut in dice; cover, and cook until\r\nthe chops are tender. Sliced potato may be added if liked, when the meat\r\nis nearly done. Remove the grease and thicken the liquor with a little\r\nbrowned flour braided with thin cream.\r\n\r\nSTEWED MUTTON CHOP NO. 2.--Prepare the chops as in the preceding.\r\nPlace a layer of meat in a deep baking dish, and then a layer of sliced\r\npotato, sprinkled with a little minced celery. Add two or more layers of\r\nmeat, alternating with layers of potatoes. Cover with boiling water and\r\nbake closely covered in a very moderate oven two and a half hours.\r\n\r\nVEAL AND LAMB.--Both veal and lamb should be thoroughly cooked;\r\notherwise they are not wholesome. They may be prepared for the tale in\r\nthe same way as beef or mutton, but will require longer time for\r\ncooking.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOULTRY AND GAME.\r\n\r\nPoultry and game differ from other animal foods in the relative quantity\r\nof fat and the quality of their juices. The fat of birds is laid up\r\nunderneath the skin and in various internal parts of the body, while but\r\na small proportion is mingled with the fibers or the juices of the\r\nflesh. The flesh of the chicken, turkey, and guinea-fowl is more\r\ndelicately flavored, more tender and easy to digest, than that of geese\r\nand ducks. Chickens broiled require three hours for digestion; when\r\nboiled or roasted, four hours are needed.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of poultry is less stimulating than beef, and is thus\r\nconsidered better adapted for invalids. The flesh of wild fowl contains\r\nless fat than that of poultry; it is also tender and easy of digestion.\r\nDifferent birds and different parts of the same bird, vary considerably\r\nin color and taste. The breed, food, and method of fattening, influence\r\nthe quality of this class of foods. Fowls poorly fed and allowed wide\r\nrange are far from cleanly in their habits of eating; in fact, they are\r\nlargely scavengers, and through the food they pick up, often become\r\ninfested with internal parasites, and affected with tuberculosis and\r\nother diseases which are liable to be communicated to those who eat\r\ntheir flesh.\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS FOR THE SELECTION OF POULTRY AND GAME.--The first care\r\nin the selection of poultry should be its freedom from disease. Birds\r\ndeprived of exercise, shut up in close cages, and regularly stuffed with\r\nas much corn or soft food as they can swallow, may possess the requisite\r\nfatness, but it is of a most unwholesome character. When any living\r\ncreature ceases to exercise, its excretory organs cease to perform their\r\nfunctions thoroughly, and its body becomes saturated with retained\r\nexcretions.\r\n\r\nA stall-fed fowl may be recognized by the color of its fat, which is\r\npale white, and lies in thick folds beneath the skin along the lower\r\nhalf of the backbone. The entire surface of the body presents a more\r\ngreasy, uninviting appearance than that of fowls permitted to live under\r\nnatural conditions.\r\n\r\nNever purchase fowls which have been sent to the market undrawn. All\r\nanimals intended for use as food should be dressed as quickly as\r\npossible after killing. Putrefactive changes begin very soon after\r\ndeath, and the liver and other viscera, owing to their soft texture and\r\nto the quantity of venous blood they retain, advance rapidly in\r\ndecomposition. When a fowl or animal is killed, even if the large\r\narteries at the throat are cut, a large quantity of blood remains in and\r\naround the intestines, owing to the fact that only through the\r\ncapillaries of the liver can the blood in the portal system find its way\r\ninto the large vessels which convey it to the heart, and which at death\r\nare cut off from the general circulation at both ends by a capillary\r\nsystem. This leaves the blood-vessels belonging to the portal\r\ncirculation distended with venous blood, which putrefies very quickly,\r\nforming a virulent poison. The contents of the intestines of all\r\ncreatures are always in a more or less advanced state of putrescence,\r\nready to undergo rapid decomposition as soon as the preservative action\r\nof the intestinal fluids ceases. It will readily be seen, then, that\r\nthe flesh of an undrawn fowl must be to a greater or less degree\r\npermeated with the poisonous gases and other products of putrefaction,\r\nand is certainly quite unfit for food.\r\n\r\nYoung fowls have soft, yellow feet, a smooth, moist skin, easily torn\r\nwith a pin, wings which will spring easily, and a breastbone which will\r\nyield to pressure. Pinfeathers are an indication of a young bird; older\r\nfowls are apt to have sharp scales, long hairs, long, thin necks, and\r\nflesh with a purplish tinge.\r\n\r\nPoultry should be entirely free from disagreeable odors. Methods are\r\nemployed for sweetening fowls which have been kept too long in market,\r\nbut if they need such attention, bury them decently rather than cook\r\nthem for the table.\r\n\r\nTurkeys should have clear, full eyes, and soft, loose spurs. The legs of\r\nyoung birds are smooth and black; those of older ones, rough and\r\nreddish.\r\n\r\nGeese and ducks, when freshly killed, have supple feet. If young, the\r\nwindpipe and beak can be easily broken by pressure of the thumb and\r\nforefinger. Young birds also have soft, white fat, tender skin, yellow\r\nfeet, and legs free from hairs.\r\n\r\nThe legs of young pigeons are flesh-colored. When in good condition, the\r\nbreast should be full and plump, and if young, it is of a light reddish\r\ncolor. Old pigeons have dark flesh; squabs always have pinfeathers.\r\n\r\nPartridges, when young, have dark bills and yellow legs.\r\n\r\nThe breast of all birds should be full and plump. Birds which are\r\ndiseased always fall away on the breast, and the bone feels sharp and\r\nprotrudes.\r\n\r\nTO DRESS POULTRY AND BIRDS.--First strip off the feathers a few at\r\na time, with a quick, jerking motion toward the tail. Remove pinfeathers\r\nwith a knife.\r\n\r\nFowls should be picked, if possible, while the body retains some warmth,\r\nas scalding is apt to spoil the skin and parboil the flesh. When all the\r\nfeathers but the soft down have been removed, a little hot water may be\r\npoured on, when the down can be easily rubbed off with the palm of the\r\nhand. Wipe dry, and singe the hairs off by holding the bird by the legs\r\nover the flame of a candle, a gas-jet, or a few drops of alcohol poured\r\non a plate and lighted. To dress a bird successfully, one should have\r\nsome knowledge of its anatomy, and it is well for the amateur first to\r\ndress one for some dish in which it is not to be cooked whole, when the\r\nbird may be opened, and the position of its internal organs studied.\r\n\r\nRemove the head, slip the skin back from the neck, and cut it off close\r\nto the body, take out the windpipe and pull out the crop from the end of\r\nthe neck. Make an incision through the skin a little below the\r\nleg-joint, bend the leg at this point and break off the bone. If care\r\nhas been taken to cut only through the skin, the tendons of the leg may\r\nnow be easily removed with the fingers.\r\n\r\nIf the bird is to be cut up, remove the legs and wings at the joints.\r\nThen beginning near the vent, cut the membrane down between the\r\nbreastbone and tail to the backbone on each side, and separate just\r\nbelow the ribs. The internal organs can now been seen and easily\r\nremoved, and the body of the bird divided at its joints.\r\n\r\nIf desired to keep the fowl whole, after removing the windpipe and crop,\r\nloosen the heart, liver, and lungs by introducing the forefinger at the\r\nneck; cut off the oil-sack, make a slit horizontally under the tail,\r\ninsert the first and middle fingers, and after separating the membranes\r\nwhich lie close to the body, press them along within the body until the\r\nheart and liver can be felt. The gall bladder lies directly under the\r\nleft lobe of the liver, and if the fingers are kept up, and all\r\nadhesions loosened before an effort is made to draw the organs out,\r\nthere will be little danger of breaking it. Remove everything which can\r\nbe taken out, then hold the, fowl under the faucet and cleanse\r\nthoroughly.\r\n\r\nTO TRUSS A FOWL OR BIRD.--Twist the tips of the wings back under\r\nthe shoulder and bend the legs as far up toward the breast as possible,\r\nsecuring them in that position by putting a skewer through one thigh\r\ninto the body and out through the opposite thigh. Then bring the legs\r\ndown and fasten close to the vent.\r\n\r\nTO STUFF A FOWL.--Begin at the neck, stuff the breast full, draw\r\nthe neck skin together, double it over on the back and fasten with a\r\ndarning needle threaded with fine twine. Put the remainder of the\r\nstuffing into the body at the other opening.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nBIRDS BAKED IN SWEET POTATOES.--Small birds, of which the breast is\r\nthe only suitable portion for eating, may be baked in the following\r\nmanner: Cut a sweet potato lengthwise; make a cavity in each half. Place\r\nthe breast of the bird therein; fit, and tie together carefully; bake\r\nuntil the potato is soft. Serve in the potato.\r\n\r\nBOILED FOWL.--After cleaning and dividing the fowl, put into\r\nboiling water, and proceed as directed on page 395.\r\n\r\nBROILED BIRDS.--Pluck and wipe clean with a damp cloth. Split down\r\nthe middle of the back, and carefully draw the bird. Proceed as directed\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nBROILED FOWL.--A young bird well dressed and singed is best for\r\nthis purpose. Split down the middle of the back, wipe clean with a damp\r\ncloth, twist the top of the wings from the second joint; spread out\r\nflat, and with a rolling pin break the projecting breastbone so that the\r\nbird will lie flat upon the broiler. When ready to cook, place it skin\r\nuppermost and sear the under side by pressing it on a hot pan; then\r\nbroil the same as beefsteak over glowing coals.\r\n\r\nCORN AND CHICKEN.--Clean and divide a chicken in joints. Stew in\r\nmilk or part milk and water until nearly tender; then add the grains and\r\njuice from a dozen ears of corn. Cook slowly until the corn is done;\r\nseason lightly with salt, and serve with dry toast.\r\n\r\nPIGEONS, QUAILS, AND PARTRIDGES may be half baked, then cooked as\r\ndirected for Smothered Chicken until tender.\r\n\r\nROAST CHICKEN.--Dress carefully, singe, wash, and wipe dry. Put\r\ninto a pan of the proper size, add a cup of boiling water, and cook very\r\nslowly for the first half hour, then increase the heat, baste\r\nfrequently, turn occasionally so that no portion will brown too fast.\r\nCook from one to two hours according to size and age of the bird. It is\r\nusually considered essential to stuff a fowl for roasting, but a\r\ndressing compounded of melted fat and crumbs seasoned with herbs and\r\nstrong condiments is not to be recommended.\r\n\r\nIf a dressing is considered necessary, it may be made of a quart of\r\ncrumbs of rather stale whole-wheat bread, moistened with cream, to which\r\nadd a small handful of powdered and sifted sage leaves which have been\r\ndried in the oven until crisp. Add salt as desired, a well-beaten egg,\r\nand a little chopped celery.\r\n\r\nROAST TURKEY.--Pluck, singe, and dress the turkey; wash thoroughly\r\nand wipe with a dry cloth. If dressing is to be used, stuff the body\r\nfull, sew up, and truss. Place in a dripping-pan, add a pint of boiling\r\nwater, and put in an oven so moderate that the turkey will not brown for\r\nthe first hour; afterward the heat may be somewhat increased, but at no\r\ntime should the oven be very hot. After the bird becomes brown, baste it\r\noccasionally with the water in the pan, dredging lightly with flour.\r\nCook until the legs will separate from the body; three or four hours\r\nwill be necessary for a small turkey. One half hour to the pound is the\r\nusual rule. When tender, remove the stuffing and serve it hot, placing\r\nthe turkey on a large hot platter to be carved. It may be garnished with\r\nparsley or celery leaves and served with cranberry sauce.\r\n\r\nDucks and geese may be prepared and roasted in the same manner, but less\r\ntime will suffice for cooking, about one and one third hours for ducks\r\nof ordinary size, and about three hours for a young goose.\r\n\r\nA stuffing of mashed potato seasoned with onion, sage, and salt is\r\nconsidered preferable for a goose. Equal parts of bread crumbs and\r\nchopped apples moistened in a little cream are also used for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nSMOTHERED CHICKEN.--Cut two chickens into joints and put in a\r\nclosely covered kettle with a pint of boiling water. Heat very slowly to\r\nboiling, skim, keep covered, and simmer until tender and the water\r\nevaporated; add salt, turn the pieces, and brown them in their own\r\njuices.\r\n\r\nSTEAMED CHICKEN.--Prepare the chicken as for roasting, steam until\r\nnearly tender, dredge with flour and a little salt; put into a\r\ndripping-pan and brown in the oven. Other birds and fowls may be\r\nprepared in the same way.\r\n\r\nSTEWED CHICKEN.--Divide a chicken into pieces suitable for serving,\r\nand stew as directed for beef on page 400. Old fowls left whole and\r\nstewed in this manner for a long time and afterward roasted, are much\r\nbetter than when prepared in any other way. If a gravy is desired,\r\nprepare as for stewed beef. Other poultry may be stewed likewise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFISH.\r\n\r\nFish is a less stimulating article of food than other meats. Edible fish\r\nare generally divided into two classes, those of white flesh and those\r\nmore or less red. The red-fleshed fish, of which the salmon is a\r\nrepresentative, have their fat distributed throughout the muscular\r\ntissues, while in white fish the fat is stored up in the liver; hence\r\nthe latter class is much easier of digestion, and being less\r\nstimulating, is to be recommended as more wholesome. Different kinds of\r\nfish have different nutritive values. Their flavor and wholesomeness are\r\ngreatly influenced by the nature of their food and the condition of the\r\nwater in which they are caught; those obtained in deep water with strong\r\ncurrents are considered superior to those found in shallow water. Fish\r\nare sometimes poisonous, owing no doubt to the food they eat.\r\n\r\nLike all animal foods, fish are subject to parasites, some of which take\r\nup their abode in the human body when fish infected with them are eaten.\r\nAn eminent scientist connected with the Smithsonian Institution,\r\ncontributed an article to _Forest and Stream_ a few years ago, in which\r\nhe stated that in the salmon no less than sixteen kinds of parasitic\r\nworms have been discovered, and undoubtedly many others remain unknown;\r\nfour species were tapeworms, and four, roundworms. The yellow perch is\r\nknown to be infested with twenty-three species of parasitic worms.\r\n\r\nThe pike carries with him at least twenty kinds, while many other\r\nvarieties of fish are equally infested.\r\n\r\nFish have been highly lauded as a food particularly suited to the\r\ndevelopment of the brain and nervous system. This no doubt has arisen\r\nfrom the fact that fish contain a considerable amount of phosphorus.\r\nPhosphorus is also present in the human brain, and for this reason it\r\nhas been supposed that fish must be excellent nutriment for the brain;\r\nbut the truth is, there is no such thing as any special brain or nerve\r\nfood. What is good to build up one part of the body is good for the\r\nwhole of it; a really good food contains the elements to nourish every\r\norgan of the body.\r\n\r\nSalted fish, like salted meat, is deprived of most of its nutriment\r\nduring the curing process, and being rendered much more difficult of\r\ndigestion, possesses very little value as a food.\r\n\r\nSHELL-FISH (OYSTERS, CLAMS, SCALLOPS, LOBSTERS, CRABS,\r\nETC.)--Although considered a luxury by epicures, shellfish are not\r\npossessed of a high nutritive value. The whole class are scavengers by\r\nnature and according to recent researches it appears that they are not\r\naltogether safe articles of diet. Many cases of severe and extensive\r\nsickness have been traced to the use of clams and oysters.\r\nInvestigations made to ascertain the cause show the poisonous part of\r\nthe mussel to be the liver. Rabbits and other small animals inoculated\r\nwith the poison died in one or two minutes. Not all mussels are thus\r\npoisonous, but inasmuch as there is an abundance of wholesome food, it\r\nwould certainly seem the part of wisdom to discard shellfish altogether.\r\n\r\nHOW TO SELECT AND PREPARE FISH.--The flesh of good, fresh fish is\r\nfirm and hard, and will respond at once to pressure with the fingers. If\r\nthe flesh feels soft and flabby, the fish is not fresh. The eyes should\r\nbe full and bright and the gills of a clear red color.\r\n\r\nFish should be cleaned as soon as possible after being caught. To do\r\nthis, lay the fish upon a board, and holding it by the tail, scrape off\r\nthe scales with a dull knife held nearly flat, working from the tail\r\ntoward the head. Scrape slowly, and rinse the knife frequently in cold\r\nwater. Cut off the head and fins, make an opening from the gills halfway\r\ndown the lower part of the body, scrape out the entrails and every\r\nparticle of blood. Remove the white part that lies along the backbone,\r\nthen thoroughly rinse and wipe dry.\r\n\r\nKeep in a cool place until ready to cook, but do not place directly on\r\nice, as that will have a tendency to soften the flesh. Fresh fish should\r\nnever be allowed to soak in water. If salt fish is to be used, it should\r\nbe freshened by placing it skin-side up in cold water, and soaking for\r\nseveral hours, changing the water frequently.\r\n\r\nFrozen fish should be placed in cold water to thaw, and when thawed,\r\nshould be cooked immediately.\r\n\r\nFish is cooked by nearly all methods, but retains more nourishment when\r\nbroiled or baked. It should be thoroughly cooked, being both\r\nindigestible and unpalatable when underdone.\r\n\r\nBoiled fish is usually dependent for flavor upon some kind of rich sauce\r\nso incompatible with healthy digestion that we do not recommend this\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nBAKED FISH.--Select a perfectly fresh, properly dressed fish. Rinse\r\nthoroughly and wipe dry. Fold it together and place in a dripping pan\r\nwith a cup of boiling water. Cook slowly and steadily until tender. A\r\nfish weighing three or four pounds will require at least two hours. If\r\ndesired, the fish may be lightly dredged with flour, toward the last, as\r\nit begins to brown.\r\n\r\nBROILED FISH.--Thoroughly clean the fish, and if small, split down\r\nthe back. Fish of larger size should be cut into inch slices. Use a\r\ndouble wire broiler well oiled with a bit of suet. Lay the fish, with\r\nits thickest part next the center of the broiler, skin uppermost, and\r\nbroil over a bed of clear coals until the flesh-side is of an even\r\nbrown. The time required will vary, according to the size of the fish,\r\nfrom five to twenty minutes; then turn and brown on the other side. If\r\nthe fish be very thick, when both sides are browned, put the broiler in\r\nthe oven over a dripping pan and cook until done.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEAT SOUP.\r\n\r\nSoups made from meat require first the preparation of a special material\r\ncalled _stock_, a liquid foundation upon which to begin the soup.\r\n\r\nBeef, veal, mutton, and poultry are all made into stock in the same\r\nmanner, so that general rules for its preparation will be sufficient for\r\nall meat soups.\r\n\r\nThe principal constituents of meat and bones, the material from which\r\nstock is compounded, are fiber, albuminous elements, gelatinous\r\nsubstances, and flavoring matters. The albuminous elements are found\r\nonly in the flesh. The gelatinous substance found in bones, skin, and\r\ntendons, is almost devoid of nutriment. In selecting material for stock,\r\ntherefore, it is well to remember that the larger the proportion of lean\r\nmeat used, the more nutritious will be the soup.\r\n\r\nBut little else than gelatine is obtained from the bones, and although\r\nserviceable in giving consistency, a soup made principally from bones is\r\nnot valuable as a food. The amount of bone used for soup should never\r\nexceed the flesh material in weight. The bones, trimmings, and remnants\r\nof steaks, chops, and roasts may be advantageously utilized for soups.\r\nBits of roast meat and roast gravies are especially serviceable\r\nmaterial, since they are rich in the flavoring elements of meat. It\r\nshould be remembered, however, that these flavoring matters are chiefly\r\nexcrementitious or waste substances, derived from the venous blood of\r\nthe animal.\r\n\r\nThe greatest care must be observed to keep the scraps perfectly sweet\r\nand fresh until needed, as stale meat is exceedingly unwholesome. If the\r\nscraps are mostly cooked meats and bones, a small portion of raw, lean\r\nmeat should be used with them; it need not be of the choicest quality;\r\ntough, coarse meat, when fresh and good, can be advantageously used for\r\nsoup stock.\r\n\r\nIf fresh material is to be procured, select for beef soups a piece from\r\nthe shin or lower round; the same choice of pieces may be made of veal;\r\nof mutton, pieces from the forequarter and neck are best.\r\n\r\nIn preparing meat for soup, if it is soiled, scrub the outside\r\nthoroughly with a clean cloth wet in cold water, or cut away the soiled\r\nportion. Break the bones into as small pieces as convenient; cut the\r\nmeat into inch dice, remove the marrow from the bones, and put it aside.\r\nIf added to the stock, it will make it greasy.\r\n\r\nHaving selected proper material and prepared it for use, the next step\r\nis to extract the juices. To do this put it into cold water, bring very\r\ngradually to the boiling point,--an hour is not too long for\r\nthis,--then cook slowly but continuously. In the observation of these\r\nsimple measures lies the secret of success in stock-making.\r\n\r\nThe albuminous elements of the meat, which are similar in character to\r\nthe white of an egg, are readily dissolved in cold or tepid water, but\r\nboiling water coagulates them. If the meat is put into boiling water,\r\nthe albumen coagulates, or hardens, forming a sort of crust on the\r\noutside of the meat, which prevents the inner juices from escaping; on\r\nthe contrary, if the meat is put to cook in cold water, and is gradually\r\nraised to the boiling point, the soaking and simmering will easily\r\nextract and dissolve the juices.\r\n\r\nSalt likewise hinders the extraction of the meat juices, and should not\r\nbe added to stock during its preparation.\r\n\r\nThe best utensil for use in the preparation of stock is a soup digester.\r\nThis is a porcelain-lined kettle, resting on standards, with a cover\r\nfitting closely into a groove, so that no steam can escape except\r\nthrough a valve in the top of the cover. In this the meat can be placed\r\nand allowed to cook for hours without burning. An ordinary granite-ware\r\nkettle with tightly fitting cover set on a stove ring or brick, answers\r\nquite well. It should, however, be kept entirely for this purpose. A\r\ndouble boiler is also suitable.\r\n\r\nThe correct proportion of water is to be used is about one quart to each\r\npound of meat and bones, though this will vary somewhat with the\r\nmaterial and the length of time required for cooking. The scum which is\r\nthrown to the surface of the water during the cooking process is\r\ncomposed of blood and other impurities, and should be removed as rapidly\r\nas it rises. If allowed to remain after the water reaches the boiling\r\npoint, it will become incorporated into the stock and injure it in\r\nflavor and wholesomeness.\r\n\r\nIf the meat and bones are well cut and broken, the juices ought to be\r\nall extracted, with proper cooking, in three or four hours. Longer\r\ncooking will render the stock thicker and more gelatinous but not more\r\nnutritious, and too long cooking will detract from its flavor. As soon\r\nas the meat will fall from the bones, the stock should be removed from\r\nthe pot and strained at once.\r\n\r\nA good way to strain stock is to place a colander over an earthen crock\r\nor jar (the colander should fit inside the jar), with a cloth strainer\r\nwithin the colander. Then dip the contents of the stock kettle into the\r\ncolander, and leave it there to drain for fifteen or twenty minutes. Do\r\nnot squeeze the cloth, and when well drained, throw the scraps away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arrangement for Straining Stock.]\r\n\r\nFrench cooks, with their propensity for economy, sometimes select a good\r\nquality of beef, cook it so as to retain a portion of the juices in the\r\nmeat, and make it serve both for preparing the soup and for boiled beef\r\non the bill of fare. The meat is not cut up, but is heated quickly and\r\nremoved as soon as tender, so that only part of the juices are\r\nextracted.\r\n\r\nSet the stock where it will become cold. The more rapidly it cools, the\r\nmore delicate will be its flavor, and the better it will keep. The fat\r\nwill rise to the surface, and can be easily removed when desired. If the\r\nquantity of fat in the material used was considerable, a solid cake will\r\ncover the top. This fat, by excluding the air, helps keep the stock\r\nsweet, and should not be removed until the stock is needed.\r\n\r\nIf only a portion is to be used at one time, the remainder with the fat\r\nshould be reheated and cooled, that a new crust may be formed. In\r\nwinter, stock may be kept several days, if care is thus taken to reheat\r\nit. In summer, unless kept in a very cold place, it will spoil in a few\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nSoup should never be greasy, and hence, before using the stock, every\r\nparticle of the fat should be removed. To accomplish this, loosen the\r\ncake of fat from the dish with a knife, and if solid, it will sometimes\r\ncome off whole; if soft, remove all that is possible without cutting\r\ninto the stock, and afterwards wipe the top of the jellied stock with a\r\ncloth wrung out of very hot water, which will readily absorb any\r\nlingering portion of fat. If the stock is not jellied, skim off all the\r\nfat possible, and then turn the stock through a napkin wrung out of ice\r\nwater. This will harden the grease, which will adhere to the napkin. It\r\nis always better to prepare stock long enough before it is needed to\r\nallow it to become perfectly cold; if, however, it is necessary to use\r\nthe stock very soon after it is prepared, the fat may be quickly\r\nhardened by turning the stock into a dripping pan or some other shallow\r\ndish, and placing it on ice in a cool place; if there is no time for\r\nthis, strain several times through a napkin wrung out of ice-cold water,\r\nremoving the particles of fat each time and wringing the cloth anew\r\nbefore straining again. A little cold water poured into hot stock will\r\nalso cause the grease to rise so that it can be easily skimmed off; but\r\nthis method weakens the stock.\r\n\r\nStock may be prepared from one kind of meat only, or from two or more\r\ndifferent kinds mixed together. Chicken stock is generally conceded to\r\nbe better if a small portion of beef is combined with the fowl. Beef and\r\nveal are largely used together; but mutton on account of its strong\r\nflavor is better used alone.\r\n\r\nStock, when prepared from a single kind of meat, is termed simple stock\r\nor broth. When prepared from two or more kinds of flesh cooked together,\r\nor when stock prepared separately from different kinds of meat are mixed\r\ntogether, the result is termed compound stock or double broth. With\r\neither of these stocks as a foundation, an innumerable variety of soups\r\nmay be prepared, either by serving them as plain broth or by the\r\naddition of some of the various grains and vegetables, the distinctive\r\nname of each soup being given it according to its principal solid\r\ningredient.\r\n\r\nTO CLARIFY SOUP STOCK.--Having removed all the fat from the stock,\r\nadd to it before reheating, the shell of an egg, and the whole of one\r\negg well beaten, with a little cold water, for every three pints of\r\nsoup. Place the soup over the fire and stir it constantly to keep the\r\negg from setting until it is hot. Simmer for fifteen minutes, removing\r\nthe scum as it rises, and strain through a flannel cloth or napkin laid\r\nin a colander. It is also a good plan to place a fine wire strainer on\r\nthe napkin to catch the shells and scum. Do not squeeze the cloth or\r\nstir the liquid with a spoon to hasten the straining process. If the\r\ncloth is clogged so that the stock does not run through well, carefully\r\nchange it in the colander so that the liquid will run down upon a clean\r\nportion. When strained, it may be reheated, seasoned, and served as\r\nclear soup.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nASPARAGUS SOUP.--This soup is prepared in every way like the one on\r\npage 276, except that while stock made from veal is used instead of\r\nmilk. Green pea soup, celery soup, green corn soup, and green bean soup\r\nmay be prepared according to the recipes already given for these soups\r\nby substituting for milk the same quantity of the stock of veal or\r\nchicken.\r\n\r\nBARLEY, RICE, SAGO, OR TAPIOCA SOUP.--Any kind of stock may be used\r\nin making these soups, though chicken and mutton stock are generally\r\nconsidered preferable. Prepare the grains, the sago, or the tapioca, by\r\nsteaming or boiling till well cooked, and add to the stock, which should\r\nbe at boiling temperature. Season and serve.\r\n\r\nCARAMEL FOR COLORING SOUP BROWN.--Melt a half pint of sugar and one\r\ntablespoonful of water in a saucepan over the fire; stir constantly\r\nuntil it is of a dark brown color; then add a half pint of boiling\r\nwater, simmer ten minutes, strain, and put into an air-tight can or\r\nbottle. When needed, mix such a quantity with the soup as will give the\r\ndesired degree of color.\r\n\r\nJULIENNE SOUP.--Take an equal proportion of carrot, parsnip,\r\nturnip, celery, and string beans, cut into thin pieces of inch lengths,\r\nsufficient to make one pint. Simmer the vegetables gently in a small\r\nquantity of water until tender, but not long enough to destroy their\r\nshape. Heat a quart of clear stock to boiling, add vegetables, salt to\r\ntaste, and serve.\r\n\r\nOther vegetables, as peas, asparagus, etc. may be used in the season.\r\nSometimes the vegetables are cut into dice or fancy shapes with a\r\nvegetable cutter. It makes little difference about the shape, so that\r\nthe pieces are small and uniform in size. Such vegetables as potatoes,\r\ncarrots, or turnips, when used for soups, are easiest cut, after paring\r\nin the usual manner, by taking the vegetable in the left hand, holding\r\nit on the table or board between thumb and finger, and with the right\r\nhand cutting downward in even slices not over one third of an inch wide,\r\nto within a quarter of an inch of the bottom. Turn the vegetable and\r\nrepeat the process, cutting across the first slices. Again lay the\r\nvegetable on its side, and make a third series of cuts, which will\r\ndivide it into cubes. If several kinds of vegetables are used, those\r\nwhich require a longer time for cooking should be cut into smaller\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nTOMATO SOUP.--Into two quarts of boiling beef stock stir a\r\nteaspoonful of cornstarch well braided with a little cold water, and a\r\npint of strained, stewed tomatoes. Boil a few minutes, and serve. A\r\nteaspoonful of sugar may also be added, if desired.\r\n\r\nWHITE SOUP.--White soups are made from veal or chicken stock,\r\nseasoned with cream, flavored with onion or celery, and thickened with\r\ncornstarch or flour.\r\n\r\nVERMICELLI OR MACARONI SOUPS.--Drop into boiling water and cook the\r\nmacaroni about one hour, the vermicelli ten minutes. Drain well, dash\r\ncold water through them to separate the pieces, which are apt to stick\r\ntogether, and add to boiling stock (beef and veal are preferable) in the\r\nproportion of a pint of cooked macaroni or vermicelli to a quart of\r\nsoup. Salt to taste and serve.\r\n\r\nPUREE WITH CHICKEN.--Take a quart of chicken stock from which the\r\nfat has been removed. Add a stalk or two of celery cut into\r\nfinger-lengths, and a slice of onion, and put to boil. Beat together the\r\nmashed yolk of two hard boiled eggs, and a half cup of sweet cream. Chop\r\nthe white meat of the chicken until fine as meal and beat with the egg\r\nmixture. Add slowly a cup and a half of hot milk. Remove the celery and\r\nonion from the hot stock, and stir all together. Boil up, salt to taste,\r\nand serve. If too thick, a little more stock or milk can be added.\r\n\r\nTAPIOCA CREAM SOUP.--Soak two tablespoonfuls of tapioca over night.\r\nHeat a quart of stock prepared from the white meat of chicken, to\r\nboiling, in a saucepan. Then stir the tapioca in gradually. Move the\r\nsaucepan to the side of the range where it will simmer till the tapioca\r\nis transparent. Have ready in a large dish a mixture prepared by beating\r\ntogether very thoroughly the yolks of three eggs and four tablespoonfuls\r\nof sweet cream. When the tapioca is clear, remove the stock from the\r\nrange and pour it very gradually onto the egg mixture, stirring briskly\r\nall the time, so that the egg will not curdle. Season with salt if\r\ndesired. The soup may be returned to the stove and warmed before serving\r\nif necessary, but it must not be boiled or allowed to stand a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE TOPICS.\r\n\r\n    Animal food is one of the greatest means by which the pure sentiment\r\n    of the race is depressed.--_Alcott._\r\n\r\n    An English medical author says, \"It is no doubt true that the\r\n    constant use of animal food disqualifies the mind for literary\r\n    application. We can scarcely imagine a philosopher living on horse\r\n    flesh like a Tartar, or on buffalo meat like an Indian; and it is a\r\n    fact that these tribes appear incapable of civilization until they\r\n    acquire the habit of using a less stimulating diet, and begin to\r\n    cultivate the fruits of the earth for their own use. The difference,\r\n    in the success of Christian missions, between such people and those\r\n    whose chief sustenance is farinaceous food, is very striking and\r\n    worthy of especial notice. In the East, and in Polynesia, literature\r\n    and Christian doctrines are seized upon with avidity. But in vain\r\n    were the most earnest labors of the best men to introduce reading\r\n    and writing among the American Indians until they had first been\r\n    taught to grow corn and to eat bread.\"\r\n\r\n    An American gentleman traveling in the East met a Brahmin priest,\r\n    who refused to shake hands with him for fear of pollution. The\r\n    reason he assigned was that Americans eat hogs. Said the priest,\r\n    \"Why, I have heard that in America they put hogs' flesh in barrels\r\n    and eat it after it has been dead six months! Horrible!\"\r\n\r\n    Pork is by no means a favorite food in Scotland. King James is said\r\n    to have abhorred pork almost as much as he did tobacco. He said, \"If\r\n    I were to give a banquet to the devil, I would provide a loin of\r\n    pork and a poll of ling, with a pipe of tobacco for digestion!\"\r\n    --_Scott._\r\n\r\n    The Hindu would as soon think of becoming a cannibal as of eating\r\n    swine's flesh. It is stated that the Indian mutiny so frightful in\r\n    its results originated in a fear among the Sepoys that they would be\r\n    forced to eat pork. A lady in India had an amusing experience which\r\n    illustrates the Hindu sentiment on the subject of pig. Arriving late\r\n    at a grand dinner, she and her husband saw the first course being\r\n    carried in as they went down the hall. A row of khitmutgars was\r\n    drawn up, waiting to follow the dish into the dining-room, and serve\r\n    their respective employers; as a dish of ham was carried by, each\r\n    man gravely and deliberately spat upon it! Needless to say, Mrs. B.\r\n    and her lord waited for the second course.\r\n\r\n    Both the ancient Syrians and Egyptians abstained from flesh-eating\r\n    out of dread and abhorrence, and when the latter would represent any\r\n    thing as odious or disagreeable by hieroglyphics, they painted a\r\n    fish.\r\n\r\n    Yes, Agassiz does recommend authors to eat fish because the\r\n    phosphorus in it makes brains. So far you are correct. But I cannot\r\n    help you to a decision about the amount you need to eat--at least\r\n    with certainty. If the specimen composition you send is about your\r\n    fair usual average, I should judge that perhaps a couple of whales\r\n    would be all you want for the present; not the largest kind, but\r\n    simply good, middling-sized whales!--_Mark Twain's Letter to a Young\r\n    Author._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD FOR THE SICK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Food for the Sick]\r\n\r\nThere is no branch of the culinary art which requires more skill than\r\nthat of preparing food for the sick and feeble. The purpose of food at\r\nall times is to supply material for repairing--the waste which is\r\nconstantly be chosen with reference to its nutritive value. But during\r\nillness and convalescence, when the waste is often much greater and the\r\nvital powers less active, it is of the utmost importance that the food\r\nshould be of such a character as will supply the proper nutrition. Nor\r\nis this all; an article of food may contain all the elements of\r\nnutrition in such proportions as to render it a wholesome food for those\r\nin health, and not be a proper food for the sick, for the reason that\r\nits conversion into blood and tissue lays too great a tax upon the\r\ndigestive organs. Food for the sick should be palatable, nutritious and\r\neasily assimilated. To discriminate as to what food will supply these\r\nrequisites, one must possess some knowledge of dietetics and physiology,\r\nas well as of the nature of the illness with which the patient is\r\nsuffering; and such a knowledge ought to be part of the education of\r\nevery woman, no matter to what class of society she belongs.\r\n\r\nThere are no special dishes suitable alike for all cases. Hot buttered\r\ntoast, tea, rich jellies, and other dainties so commonly served to the\r\nsick, are usually the very worst articles of diet of which they could\r\npartake. As a general rule, elaborate dishes are not suitable.\r\n\r\nWell-cooked gruel, a nicely broiled steak, a glass of milk, or some\r\nrefreshing drink often serve far better than foods which combine a\r\ngreater variety of ingredients, and require more extensive preparation.\r\nThe simplest foods are always the best, because the most readily\r\nassimilated.\r\n\r\nScrupulous neatness and care in all the minute particulars of the\r\ncooking and serving of food for invalids, will add much to its\r\npalatableness. The clean napkin on the tray, the bright silver, and\r\ndainty china plate, with perhaps a sprig of leaves and flowers beside\r\nit, thinly sliced bread, toast or cracker, and the light cup partly\r\nfilled with hot gruel, are far more appetizing to the invalid than\r\ncoarse ware, thickly cut bread, and an overflowing cup of gruel, though\r\nthe cooking may be just as perfect. Anything that suggests excess or\r\nweight fatigues the sick. The appearance of milk served in a bowl, water\r\nin a mug, beef-tea in a saucer, though seemingly a trivial thing, is\r\noften sufficient to remove all desire for food.\r\n\r\nSo far as practicable, the wants of the patient should be anticipated,\r\nand the meal served, a surprise. The capricious appetite of an invalid\r\nmay sometimes be coaxed by arranging his simple food upon a tray so\r\nplanned that in the napery and service-ware used, some one particular\r\ncolor predominates, and if this color be selected to accord or harmonize\r\nas far as possible with the food allowed, the _tout ensemble_ presents a\r\npleasing fancy, which will tempt the eye, and through its influence, the\r\nappetite of the patient. For example: an invalid whose dietary must\r\nconsist of fruit and grains, might be served to a \"purple\" dinner, with\r\nbill of fare including a fresh, cool bunch of purple grapes, a glass of\r\nunfermented grape juice, a saucer of blackberry mush, a plate of nicely\r\ntoasted wafers, Graham puffs or zwieback, with stewed prunes, or a\r\nslice of prune toast served on dishes decorated with purple. Tie the\r\nnapkin with a bow of purple ribbon, and place a bunch of purple pansies\r\njust within its folds. The monotonous regimen of a poor dyspeptic which\r\npoached eggs, beaten biscuit, wheat gluten, eggnog, with, perhaps,\r\nstewed peaches or an orange, are served on gilt-band china with a spray\r\nof goldenrod, a bunch of marigolds, or a water-lily to give an\r\nadditional charm.\r\n\r\nFoods which are ordered to be served hot, should be _hot,_ not merely\r\nwarm, when they reach the patient. To facilitate this, let the dish in\r\nwhich the food is to be served, stand in hot water for a few moments;\r\ntake out, wipe dry, turn in the hot food, place on the tray, and serve.\r\nAn oil stove, alcohol lamp, or a pocket stove is very convenient for\r\nwarming gruels, broths and other similar foods, as either can be made\r\nready for use in a moment, and will heat the small quantity of food\r\nnecessary for an invalid in one fourth the time in which it could be\r\naccomplished over the range, if necessary to reduce the fire.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of food for the sick, a scrupulously clean dish for\r\ncooking is of the first importance. It is a good plan in every household\r\nto reserve one or two cooking utensils for this purpose, and not be\r\nobliged to depend upon those in daily use. Utensils used for the cooking\r\nof fruits, vegetables, meat, etc., unless cleaned with the utmost call\r\nwill sometimes impart a sufficiently unpleasant flavor to the food to\r\nrender it wholly unpalatable to an invalid whose senses are\r\npreternaturally acute.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRUELS\r\n\r\nThese simple foods, the base of which is usually some one of the grains,\r\nplay an important part in the dietary for the sick, if properly\r\nprepared; but the sloppy messes sometimes termed gruel, the chief merit\r\nof which appears to be that they \"are prepared in ten minutes,\" are\r\nscarcely better than nothing at all. Like other dishes prepared from the\r\ngrains, gruel needs a long, continuous cooking. When done, it should be\r\nthe very essence of the grain, possessing all its nutritive qualities,\r\nbut in such form as to be readily assimilated. For the making of gruels,\r\nas for the cooking of grains for any other purpose, the double boiler is\r\nthe best utensil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gruel Strainer.]\r\n\r\nIf it is desirable to strain the gruel before serving, have a fine wire\r\nstrainer of a size to stand conveniently within a large bowl or basin,\r\nturn the gruel into this, and rub it through with a wooden or silver\r\nspoon, using a second spoon, if necessary, to remove that which hangs\r\nbeneath the sieve. On no account use the first spoon for the latter\r\noperation, as by so doing one is apt to get some of the hulls into the\r\ngruel and destroy its smoothness. When as much of the gruel as possible\r\nhas been rubbed through the sieve, pour the strained liquid into a clean\r\ndish, reheat to boiling, and season as desired before serving. An\r\nextension strainer which can be fitted over any sized dish is also\r\nserviceable for straining gruels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Extension Strainer.]\r\n\r\nGruels, like all other foods, should be retained in the mouth for proper\r\ninsalivation, and it is well to eat them with wafers or some hard food,\r\nwhen solid food is allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nARROWROOT GRUEL.--Rub a dessertspoonful of _pure_ arrowroot to a\r\nthin paste in two tablespoonfuls of cold water, and stir it into a half\r\npint of boiling water, or, if preferred, a cup and a third of boiling\r\nmilk, and stir rapidly until thickened and clear. If desired, a little\r\nlemon peel for flavoring may be infused in the water or milk, before\r\nadding the arrowroot. Sweeten, if allowed, and serve.\r\n\r\nBARLEY GRUEL.--Wash three heaping tablespoonfuls of pearl barley,\r\ndrop it into a pint of boiling water, and parboil five minutes. Pour\r\nthis water off and add a quart of fresh boiling water. Let it simmer\r\ngently for three hours. Strain, season, and serve. A small piece of\r\nlemon rind added to the gruel a half hour before it is done, gives it a\r\nvery agreeable flavor. Equal quantities of milk and barley gruel make a\r\nvery nourishing drink; the milk, however, should not be added to the\r\ngruel until needed, as in a warm atmosphere it undergoes quite rapid\r\nchange, and is likely to ferment. A little lemon juice, with sugar to\r\nsweeten to taste, is sometimes preferred as seasoning for barley gruel.\r\n\r\nEGG GRUEL.--Heat a cup of milk to boiling, and stir into it one\r\nwell-beaten egg mixed with one fourth cup of cold milk. Stir constantly\r\nfor a few minutes till thickened, but do not allow it to boil again.\r\nSeason with a little salt, or if preferred and allowed, a little loaf\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\nEGG GRUEL NO. 2.--Boil the yolks of three eggs until dry and mealy,\r\nmash perfectly smooth, then add a cup of boiling milk. Season with salt,\r\nand serve.\r\n\r\nFARINA GRUEL.--Moisten two table spoonfuls of farina with a very\r\nlittle cold milk, and stir it into a cupful of boiling water. Boil until\r\nit thickens, add a cupful of new milk, turn into a double boiler, and\r\ncook again for twenty or thirty minutes. Strain if necessary, season\r\nwith salt or sugar, and serve.\r\n\r\nFLOUR GRUEL.--Rub one heaping tablespoonful of whole-wheat flour to\r\na thin paste with three tablespoonfuls of cold milk, and stir it into a\r\npint of boiling milk. Cook for ten or twelve minutes. Season with salt,\r\nstrain if necessary, and while hot, stir in the beaten white of one egg.\r\nThe egg may be omitted if preferred; or the yolk of the egg and a little\r\nsugar may be used instead, if the patient's condition will allow it.\r\n\r\nGLUTEN GRUEL.--Stir two and one half tablespoonfuls of the wheat\r\ngluten prepared by the Sanitarium Food Co., Battle Creek, Mich., into a\r\npint of boiling milk; boil until thickened, when it is ready to serve.\r\n\r\nGLUTEN GRUEL NO. 2.--Into a pint of boiling water stir three\r\nheaping tablespoonfuls of the prepared gluten. Boil until thickened, and\r\nadd a half cup of thin cream.\r\n\r\nGLUTEN CREAM.--Heat a pint of thin cream to boiling, and stir into\r\nit three tablespoonfuls of wheat gluten. When thickened, it is ready to\r\nserve.\r\n\r\nGLUTEN MEAL GRUEL.--Into a cup and a half of boiling water stir\r\nfour tablespoonfuls of gluten meal (prepared by the Sanitarium Food\r\nCo.), let it boil for a moment, add six tablespoonfuls of rather thin,\r\nsweet cream, and serve.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM GRUEL.--Heat three cups of water in the inner dish of a\r\ndouble boiler, and when vigorously boiling stir into it carefully, a\r\nlittle at a time, so as not to check the boiling, one scant cup of\r\nGraham flour which has been rubbed perfectly smooth in a cup of warm,\r\nnot hot, water. Stir until thickened, then place in the outer boiler and\r\ncook for an hour or longer. When done, strain if necessary, season with\r\nsalt if desired, and a half cup of sweet cream.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM GRITS GRUEL.--Cook three heaping tablespoonfuls of Graham\r\ngrits in a quart of boiling water, as directed in the chapter on Grains,\r\nfor three hours. Turn through a soup strainer to remove any lumps,\r\nseason with half a cup of cream, and salt if desired. Well cooked Graham\r\ngrits may be made into gruel by thinning with water or milk, straining\r\nand seasoning as above.\r\n\r\nGRUEL OF PREPARED FLOUR.--Knead a pint of flour with water into a\r\nball, and tie firmly in a linen cloth; put it into a granite-ware basin\r\nor kettle, cover with boiling water, and boil slowly, replenishing with\r\nboiling water as needed, for twelve hours. Put it before the fire to\r\ndry. Afterward remove the cloth, and also a thick skin which will have\r\nformed over the ball. Dry the interior again. When needed for use, rub a\r\ntablespoonful of the prepared flour smooth with three spoonfuls of cold\r\nmilk, and stir it into a pint of boiling milk. Cook from three to five\r\nminutes. Season with salt if desired.\r\n\r\nINDIAN MEAL GRUEL.--Make a thin paste of one teaspoonful of flour,\r\ntwo tablespoonfuls of best cornmeal, and a little water. Stir this into\r\na quart of boiling water, or milk and water in equal proportions, as\r\npreferred. Boil until the meal has set, stirring constantly; then turn\r\ninto a double boiler and cook for an hour and half or two hours. Season\r\nwith salt, and strain. If too thick, thin with milk or cream.\r\n\r\nLEMON OATMEAL GRUEL.--The United States Dispensary recommends the\r\nfollowing method of preparing oatmeal gruel for fever patients; \"Rub one\r\nheaping tablespoonful of fine oatmeal smooth in a little cold water;\r\nstir this into three pints of boiling water. Cook until the quantity is\r\nreduced to two pints; then strain, and let it cool and settle. When it\r\nis quite cold, pour the clear gruel from the sediment, add the juice of\r\na lemon, and sugar to sweeten slightly. If desirable to serve it warm,\r\nreheat before adding the lemon juice.\" Freshly cooked oatmeal may be\r\nthinned with boiling water, strained and seasoned in the same manner.\r\n\r\nMILK OATMEAL GRUEL.--Take a pint of milk and one of water, and heat\r\nto boiling. Stir in three heaping table spoonfuls of oatmeal, and cook\r\nin a double boiler for two or three hours.\r\n\r\nMILK PORRIDGE.--Take one pint of milk and the same quantity of\r\nwater, and heat to boiling. Stir in two heaping tablespoonfuls of\r\ncornmeal or Graham grits, boil, stirring continuously, until the meal\r\nhas set, then turn into a double boiler and cook for two hours or\r\nlonger. Season with salt, and a tablespoonful of sweet cream if allowed.\r\n\r\nOATMEAL GRUEL.--Into one quart of boiling water stir two heaping\r\ntablespoonfuls of fine oatmeal; let it boil until it thickens, stirring\r\nall the time; then turn into a double boiler and cook for three and a\r\nhalf or four hours. Strain before serving. A little cream may also be\r\nadded, unless contra-indicated by the patient's condition.\r\n\r\nOATMEAL GRUEL NO. 2.--Pound one half cup of coarse oatmeal until it\r\nis mealy. The easiest way to do this is to tie the oatmeal in a coarse\r\ncloth and pound it with a wooden mallet. Put it in a pint bowl, and fill\r\nthe bowl with cold water. Stir briskly for a few moments until the water\r\nis white, then allow the meal to settle. Pour off the water, being\r\ncareful to get none of the sediment. Fill the bowl a second time with\r\ncold water, stir thoroughly, let settle, and pour off the water as\r\nbefore. Do this the third time. Boil the liquid one half hour, strain,\r\nand serve hot. If very thick, a little cream or milk may be added.\r\n\r\nOATMEAL GRUEL NO, 3.--Add to one cup of well-cooked oatmeal while\r\nhot two cups of hot milk, or one cup of hot milk and one of hot water.\r\nBeat all thoroughly together, add a little salt if desired, strain, and\r\nserve.\r\n\r\nPEPTONIZED GLUTEN GRUEL.--Prepare the gruel as directed for Gluten\r\nGruel No. 1. Strain if needed, cook to lukewarm, and turn it into a\r\npitcher, which place in a dish containing hot water even in depth with\r\nthe gruel in the pitcher; add the peptonizing fluid or powder, stir\r\nwell, and let it stand in the hot water bath for ten minutes. The\r\ntemperature must not be allowed to rise over 130°. Put into a clean dish\r\nand serve at once, or place on ice till needed. Other well-cooked gruels\r\nmaybe peptonized in the same way.\r\n\r\nRAISIN GRUEL.--Stone and quarter two dozen raisins and boil them\r\ntwenty minutes in a small quantity of water. When the water has nearly\r\nboiled away, add two cups of new milk. When the milk is boiling, add one\r\nheaping tablespoonful of Graham or whole-wheat flour which has been\r\nrubbed to a thin paste with a little cold milk. Boil until thickened,\r\nstirring all the time; then turn into a double boiler and cook for\r\ntwenty minutes or half an hour. Season with salt and serve.\r\n\r\nRICE WATER.--Wash half a cup of rice very thoroughly in several\r\nwaters. Put it into a saucepan with three cups of cold water and boil\r\nfor half an hour. Strain off the rice water, season with salt if\r\ndesired, and serve.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS OF MILK.\r\n\r\nMILK DIET.--An almost exclusive milk diet is sometimes a great\r\nadvantage in cases of sickness. It is usually necessary to begin the use\r\nof the milk in moderate quantities, gradually withdrawing the more solid\r\nfood and increasing the quantity of milk. In the course of a week, all\r\nother food should be withdrawn, and the quantity of milk increased to\r\nthree or four quarts a day. Milk is easily digested, and hence may be\r\ntaken at more frequent intervals than other food.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nALBUMINIZED MILK.--Shake together in a well-corked bottle or glass\r\nfruit can, a pint of fresh milk and the well-beaten whites of two eggs,\r\nuntil thoroughly mixed. Serve at once.\r\n\r\nHOT MILK.--Hot milk is an excellent food for many classes of\r\ninvalids. The milk should be fresh, and should be heated in a double\r\nboiler until the top is wrinkled over the entire surface.\r\n\r\nJUNKET, OR MILK CURD.--Heat a cup of fresh milk to 85°, add one\r\nteaspoonful of the essence of pepsin, and stir just enough to mix\r\nthoroughly. Let it stand until firmly curded, and serve.\r\n\r\nKOUMISS.--Dissolve one fourth of a two-cent cake of compressed\r\nyeast, and two teaspoonfuls of white sugar, in three tablespoonfuls of\r\nlukewarm water. Pour this into a quart bottle and add sufficient fresh,\r\nsweet milk to nearly fill. Shake well, and place in a room of the\r\ntemperature of 70° to 80° F., and allow it to ferment about six hours.\r\nCork tightly and tie the cork in. Put in a cool place, act above 60° and\r\nlet it remain a week, when it will be ready for use. In making koumiss\r\nbe sure that the milk is pure, the bottle sound, and the yeast fresh.\r\nOpen the bottle with a champagne tap. If there is any curd or thickening\r\nresembling cheese, the fermentation has been prolonged beyond the proper\r\npoint, and the koumiss should not be used.\r\n\r\nMILK AND LIME WATER.--In cases where milk forms large curds, or\r\nsours in the stomach, lime water prepared in the following manner may be\r\nadded to the milk before using:--\r\n\r\nInto a gallon jar of water, put a piece of lime the size of one's fist.\r\nCover the jar and let the lime settle over night. In the morning, draw\r\nthe water off the top with a syphon, being careful not to move the jar\r\nso as to mix again the particles of lime with the water.\r\n\r\nTwo tablespoonfuls of the lime water is usually sufficient for a pint\r\nof milk.\r\n\r\nPEPTONIZED MILK FOR INFANTS.--One gill of cows' milk, fresh and\r\nunskimmed; one gill of pure water; two tablespoonfuls of rich, sweet\r\ncream; two hundred grains of milk sugar, one and one fourth grains of\r\n_extractum pancreatis_; four grains of sodium bicarbonate. Put the above\r\nin a clean nursing bottle, and place the bottle in water so warm that\r\nthe whole hand cannot be held in it longer for one minute without pain.\r\nKeep the milk at this temperature for exactly twenty minutes. Prepare\r\nfresh just before using.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEEF-TEA, BROTHS, ETC.\r\n\r\nBeef tea and meat broths are by no means so useful as foods for the sick\r\nas is generally supposed. The late Dr. Austin Flint used to say of these\r\nfoods, that \"the valuation by most persons outside of the medical\r\nprofession, and by many within it, of beef tea or its analogues, the\r\nvarious solutions, most of the extracts, and the expressed juice of\r\nmeat, is a delusion and a snare which has led to the loss of many lives\r\nby starvation.\r\n\r\n\"The quantity of nutritive material in these preparations is\r\ninsignificant or nil, and it is vastly important that they should be\r\nreckoned as of little or no value, except as indirectly conducive to\r\nnutrition by acting as stimulants for the secretion of the digestive\r\nfluids, or as vehicles for the introduction of the nutritive substances.\r\nFurthermore, it is to be considered that water and pressure not only\r\nfail to extract the alimentary principles of meat, but that the\r\nexcrementitious principles, or the products of destructive assimilation,\r\n_are_ thereby extracted.\"\r\n\r\nVegetable broths prepared from grains and legumes possess a much higher\r\nnutritive value, while they lack the objectionable features of meat\r\nbroths.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nBEEF EXTRACT.--Take a pound of lean beef, cut it up into small\r\ndice, and put into a glass fruit jar. Screw on the cover tightly, put\r\nthe jar into a vessel filled with cold water to a depth sufficient to\r\ncome to the top of contents of the jar, and set over a slow fire. As\r\nsoon as the water boils, set where it will keep just boiling, but no\r\nmore; and cook for an hour or an hour and a quarter. Then strain,\r\nseason, and serve. If preferred, a double boiler may be used for the\r\npreparation of the extract.\r\n\r\nBEEF JUICE.--Cut a thick slice of round steak, trim off every\r\nparticle of fat, and broil it over a clear fire just long enough to heat\r\nit throughout. Next gash it in many places with a sharp knife, and with\r\nthe aid of a beef-juice press or lemon squeezer, press out all the juice\r\ninto a bowl set in hot water, salt but very slightly, remove all\r\nglobules of fat, and serve. This may also be frozen and given the\r\npatient in small lumps, if so ordered.\r\n\r\nBEEF TEA.--Take a pound of fresh, lean, juicy beef of good\r\nflavor,--the top of the round and the back and middle of the rump are\r\nthe best portions for the purpose,--from which all fat, bones, and\r\nsinews have been carefully removed; cut into pieces a quarter of an inch\r\nsquare, or grind in a sausage-cutter. Add a quart of cold water, and put\r\ninto a clean double boiler. Place over the fire, and heat very slowly,\r\ncarefully removing all scum as it rises. Allow it to cook gently for two\r\nor three hours, or until the water has been reduced one half. Strain,\r\nand put away to cool. Before using, remove all fat from the surface, and\r\nseason. In reheating, a good way is to place a quantity in a cup, and\r\nset the cup into hot water until the tea is sufficiently hot. This\r\nprevents waste, and if the patient is not ready for the tea, it can be\r\neasily kept hot.\r\n\r\nBEEF TEA AND EGGS.--Beat the yolk of an egg thoroughly in a teacup\r\nand fill the cup with boiling beef tea, stirring all the while. Season\r\nwith a little salt if desired.\r\n\r\nBEEF BROTH AND OATMEAL.--Rub two tablespoonfuls of oatmeal smooth\r\nin an equal quantity of cold water, and stir into a quart of boiling\r\nbeef broth. Cook in a double broiler for two hours, strain, and season\r\nwith salt and a little cream if allowed. Or, thin well-cooked oatmeal\r\nmush with beef-tea; strain, reheat, season, and serve.\r\n\r\nBOTTLED BEEF TEA.--Cut two pounds of round steak into small dice,\r\nrejecting all skin and fat. Put it into a glass fruit jar with one cup\r\nof cold water. Cover the can sufficiently tight to prevent any water\r\nfrom boiling in, and place it on a wisp of straw or a muffin ring in a\r\nkettle of cold water. Heat very gradually, and keep it just below the\r\nboiling point for two or more hours; or, place the can in a deep dish of\r\nhot water, and cook in a moderate oven for three hours. Allow the meat\r\nto cook thus four or five hours, or until it appears white, by which\r\ntime it will have discharged all its juice. Turn the liquor off, strain\r\nthrough a piece of muslin or cheese cloth laid in a colander, and cool;\r\nthen if any fat has been left, it will harden on the top, and can be\r\nremoved. When needed for use, reheat, season, and serve.\r\n\r\nCHICKEN BROTH.--Take a well dressed, plump spring chicken, cut it\r\ninto half-inch pieces, cracking well all the bones; add cold water,--a\r\nquart to the pound of meat and bones,--and cook the same as beef-tea.\r\nAllow the broth to cool before using, and carefully skim off all\r\nparticles of fat before reheating. If allowed, a tablespoonful of\r\nsteamed rice may be added to the broth, or a well-beaten egg may be\r\nstirred in while hot just before serving. Heat until the whole becomes\r\nthickened, but do not boil.\r\n\r\nIf preferred, the broth may be prepared by using only the white portion\r\nof the chicken in connection with lean beef. This is liked better by\r\nsome to whom the strong flavor of the chicken is not pleasant. Or,\r\nprepare equal quantity of rich milk, season with salt, reheat, and\r\nserve. The broth may be flavored with celery if allowed.\r\n\r\nMUTTON BROTH.--Cut a pound of perfectly fresh, lean mutton or\r\nlamb--the scrags of neck are best--into small dice. Add a quart of cold\r\nwater, and simmer gently for two or three hours. Strain, and when cold\r\nskim off all fat. Reheat when needed for use.\r\n\r\nIf preferred, a tablespoonful of rice which has been soaked for an hour\r\nin a little warm water, or a tablespoonful of cooked barley, may be\r\nsimmered in the broth for a half hour before serving. Season with salt\r\nas desired.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE BROTH.--Put a cupful of well washed white beans into a\r\nquart of cold water in a double boiler, and cook slowly until but a\r\ncupful of the liquor remains. Strain off the broth, add salt, and serve\r\nhot. If preferred, a few grains of powdered thyme may be added as\r\nflavoring.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE BROTH NO. 2.--Pick over and wash a cup of dried Scotch\r\npeas, and put to cook in a quart of cold water, cook slowly in a double\r\nboiler or in a kettle placed on the range where they will just simmer,\r\nuntil but a cupful of liquid remains. Strain off the broth, add salt and\r\none third of a cupful of the liquor, without pulp, from well-stewed\r\ntomatoes. Serve hot.\r\n\r\nMIXED VEGETABLE BROTHS.--Broths may be prepared as directed from\r\nboth black and white beaus, and combined in the proportion of one third\r\nof the former to two thirds of the latter; or a broth of lentils may be\r\nused instead of the black bean.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES FOR PANADA._\r\n\r\nBROTH PANADA.--Use beef or chicken broth in place of water, and\r\nproceed the same as in Egg Panada, omitting the egg.\r\n\r\nCHICKEN PANADA.--Take a cupful of the white meat of chicken,\r\npounded to a paste in a mortar, and half a cup of whole-wheat crust or\r\nzwieback crumbs. Add sufficient chicken broth to make a thick gruel.\r\nSeason with salt, boil up for a few minutes, and serve hot.\r\n\r\nEGG PANADA.--Put two ounces of light, whole-wheat crusts into a\r\npint of cold water in a granite-ware stewpan; simmer gently for three\r\nquarters of an hour, stirring occasionally. Season with a spoonful of\r\nsweet cream and a little salt, then stir in the well-beaten yolk of an\r\negg, and serve.\r\n\r\nMILK PANADA.--Heat a pint of milk to boiling, then allow it to\r\ncool. Add two ounces of nice, light, whole-wheat crusts, and simmer for\r\nhalf an hour, stirring frequently. Season with a little sugar, if\r\nallowed. Granola may be used in place of the crusts, if preferred.\r\n\r\nRAISIN PANADA.--Boil a half cup of raisins in a half pint of water.\r\nBreak a slice of zwieback into fragments in a bowl. Add a well-beaten\r\negg and a teaspoonful of sugar. Pour in the raisins, water and all, and\r\nbeat very thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAINS FOR THE SICK.\r\n\r\nFor invalids able to digest solid food, rice, cracked wheat, Graham\r\ngrits, oatmeal, barley, farina and other grains may be prepared and\r\ncooked as previously directed in the chapter on Grains.\r\n\r\nThe various cooked preparations of grains--granola, wheatena, avenola,\r\nwheat gluten and gluten meal--manufactured by the Sanitarium Food Co.,\r\nBattle Creek, Mich., form excellent articles of diet for many invalids,\r\nwhen served with hot milk or cream, or prepared in the form of mush.\r\nSeveral recipes for their use have already been given in preceding\r\nchapters; the following are a few additional ones:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nGLUTEN MUSH.--Heat together a cup of thin cream and three cups of\r\nwater; when boiling, sift in lightly with the fingers, stirring\r\ncontinuously meanwhile, enough wheat gluten to make a mush of the\r\ndesired consistency. Boil up once and serve. A few blanched or roasted\r\nalmonds may be stirred in just before serving, if desired.\r\n\r\nTOMATO GLUTEN.--Heat a pint of stewed tomato, which has been rubbed\r\nthrough a fine colander to remove the seeds, to boiling, add salt to\r\nseason, and three tablespoonfuls of gluten meal. Boil together for a\r\nmoment until thickened, and serve hot.\r\n\r\nTOMATO GLUTEN NO. 2.--Prepare the same as the preceding, using five\r\ntablespoonfuls of the gluten meal, and seasoning with two tablespoonfuls\r\nof rather thick, sweet cream.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEATS FOR THE SICK.\r\n\r\nAll meats for the sick should be prepared in the very simplest way,\r\nserved with the plainest possible dressing, and without the use of\r\ncondiments other than salt.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nBROILED STEAK.--Take a half pound of round steak and a slice of\r\ntenderloin; wipe well with a clean, wet cloth. Have a clear fire; place\r\nthe meat in an open wire broiler or on a gridiron over the coals, and\r\ncook, turning as often as you can count ten, for four or five minutes,\r\nif the slices are about one inch thick; then with a lemon squeezer\r\nsqueeze the juice from the round steak over the tenderloin, season with\r\na little salt, and serve at once on a hot plate.\r\n\r\nCHICKEN.--For an invalid, the breast of a tender chicken broiled\r\nquickly over hot coals is best. For directions for broiling chicken see\r\npage 406.\r\n\r\nCHICKEN JELLY.--Dress a small chicken. Disjoint, break or pound the\r\nbones, and cut the meat into half-inch pieces. Remove every particle of\r\nfat possible. Cover with cold water, heat very slowly, and simmer gently\r\nuntil the meat is in rags, and the liquid reduced about one half. Strain\r\noff the liquor, cool, and remove all the fat. To make the broth more\r\nclear, add the shell and white of an egg, then reheat slowly, stirring\r\nall the time until hot. Strain through a fine cloth laid inside of a\r\ncolander. Salt and a little lemon may be added as seasoning. Pour into\r\nsmall cups, and cool.\r\n\r\nMINCED CHICKEN.--Stew the breast of a young chicken until tender;\r\nmince fine with a sharp knife. Thicken the liquor in which it was stewed\r\nwith a little flour, add salt and a little cream if allowed, then the\r\nminced chicken, and serve hot on zwieback, softened with cream as\r\ndirected in the chapter on Breakfast Dishes.\r\n\r\nMUTTON CHOP.--Select a chop containing a large tenderloin: cut\r\nthick, and broil for eight or ten minutes as directed for beef steak.\r\nSeason lightly with salt, and serve hot.\r\n\r\nMINCED STEAK.--Mince some nice, juicy steak with a chopping knife,\r\nor in a sausage-cutter, rejecting as much of the fiber as possible; make\r\ninto small cakes and broil the same as steak. Salt lightly when done,\r\nand for dressing use a little beef juice prepared as directed on page\r\n427. It may be thickened with a little flour as for gravy, if preferred.\r\n\r\nSCRAPED STEAK.--Take a small piece of nice, juicy steak, and with a\r\nblunt case-knife or tablespoon, scrape off all the pulp, being careful\r\nto get none of the fibers. Press the pulp together in the form of\r\npatties, and broil quickly over glowing coals. Salt lightly, and serve\r\nhot. It is better to be as rare as the patient can take it. Instead of\r\nbutter, turn a spoonful or two of thick, hot beef juice over the steak,\r\nif any dressing other than salt is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nEGGS FOR THE SICK.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nFLOATED EGG.--Separate the white from the yolk, and drop the yolk,\r\ntaking great care not to break it, into boiling, salted water. Cook\r\nuntil hard and mealy. In the meantime, beat the white of the egg until\r\nstiff and firm. When the yolk is cooked, remove it from the water with a\r\nskimmer. Let the water cease to boil, then dip the beaten white in\r\nspoonfuls on the top of the scalding water, allowing it to remain for a\r\nsecond or two until coagulated, but not hardened. Arrange the white in a\r\nhot egg saucer, and place the cooked yolk in the center, or serve on\r\ntoast. This makes a very pretty, as well as appetising dish, if care is\r\ntaken to keep the yolk intact.\r\n\r\nGLUTEN MEAL CUSTARD.--Beat together thoroughly, one pint of rich\r\nmilk, one egg, and four tablespoonfuls of gluten meal. Add a little salt\r\nif desired, and cook with the dish set in another containing boiling\r\nwater, until the custard has set. Or, turn the custard into cups, which\r\nplace in a dripping pan partly filled with hot water, and cook in a\r\nmoderate oven until the custard is set.\r\n\r\nGLUTEN CUSTARD.--Into a quart of boiling milk stir four\r\ntablespoonfuls of wheat gluten moistened with a little of the milk,\r\nwhich may be reserved for the purpose. Allow it to cook until thickened.\r\nCool to lukewarm temperature, and add three well-beaten eggs, and a\r\ntrifle of salt, if desired. Turn into cups, and steam over a kettle of\r\nboiling water until the custard is set.\r\n\r\nSTEAMED EGGS.--Break an egg into an egg saucer, sauce-dish, or\r\npatty pan, salt very slightly, and steam until the white has just set.\r\nIn this way, it will retain its shape perfectly, and not be mixed with\r\nthe few drops of water so annoying to invalids, and so hard to avoid in\r\ndishing a poached egg from water.\r\n\r\nSOFT CUSTARD.--Boil some milk, then cool it to 180°, add three\r\nwhipped eggs to each quart of milk, and keep at the temperature of 180°\r\nfor fifteen or twenty minutes. The object is to coagulate the eggs\r\nwithout producing the bad effect of exposure to a high temperature.\r\n\r\nRAW EGGS.--Break a fresh egg into a glass, add a tablespoonful of\r\nsugar, and heat to a stiff froth; a little cold water may be added if\r\nliked.\r\n\r\nWHITE OF EGG.--Stir the white of an egg into a glass of cold\r\nwater, or water as warm as it can be without coagulating the egg, and\r\nserve.\r\n\r\nWHITE OF EGG AND MILK.--The white of an egg beaten to a stiff froth\r\nand stirred into a glass of milk, forms a nourishing food for persons of\r\nweak digestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFRESHING DRINKS AND DELICACIES FOR THE SICK.\r\n\r\nIn many fevers and acute diseases, but little food is required, and that\r\nof a character which merely appeases hunger and quenches thirst, without\r\nstimulation and without affording much nourishment.\r\n\r\nPreparations from sago, tapioca, and other farinaceous substances are\r\nsometimes serviceable for this purpose. Oranges, grapes, and other\r\nperfectly ripened and juicy fruits are also most excellent. They are\r\nnature's own delicacies, and serve both for food and drink. They should\r\nnot, however, be kept in the sick room, but preserved in some cool\r\nplace, and served when needed, as fresh and in as dainty a manner as\r\npossible. Like all food provided for the sick, they should be arranged\r\nto please the eye as well as the palate. The capricious appetite of an\r\ninvalid will often refuse luscious fruit from the hand of a nurse, which\r\nwould have been gladly accepted had it been served on dainty china, with\r\na clean napkin and silver.\r\n\r\nThe juice of the various small fruits and berries forms a basis from\r\nwhich may be made many refreshing drinks especially acceptable to the\r\ndry, parched mouth of a sick person.\r\n\r\nFruit juices can be prepared with but little trouble. For directions see\r\npage 209.\r\n\r\nBeverages from fruit juices are prepared by using a small quantity of\r\nthe juice, and sufficient cold water to dilute it to the taste. If it is\r\ndesirable to use such a drink for a sick person in some household where\r\nfruit juices have not been put up for the purpose, the juice may be\r\nobtained from a can of strawberries, raspberries, or other small fruit,\r\nby turning the whole into a coarse cloth and straining off the juice; or\r\na tablespoonful of currant or other jelly may be dissolved in a tumbler\r\nof warm water, and allowed to cool. Either will make a good substitute\r\nfor the prepared fruit juice, though the flavor will be less delicate.\r\nThe hot beverages and many of the cold ones given in the chapter on\r\nBeverages will be found serviceable for the sick, as will also the\r\nfollowing additional ones:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nACORN COFFEE.--Select plump, round, sweet acorns. Shell, and brown\r\nin an oven; then grind in a coffee-mill, and use as ordinary coffee.\r\n\r\nALMOND MILK.--Blanch a quarter of a pound of shelled almonds by\r\npouring over them a quart of boiling water, and when the skins soften,\r\nrubbing them off with a coarse towel. Pound the almonds in a mortar, a\r\nfew at a time, adding four or five drops of milk occasionally, to\r\nprevent their oiling. About one tablespoonful of milk in all will be\r\nsufficient. When finely pounded, mix the almonds with a pint of milk,\r\ntwo tablespoonfuls of sugar, and a little piece of lemon rind. Place the\r\nwhole over the fire to simmer for a little time. Strain, if preferred,\r\nand serve cold.\r\n\r\nAPPLE BEVERAGE.--Pare and slice very thin a juicy tart apple into a\r\nchina bowl. Cover with boiling water, put a saucer over the bowl, and\r\nallow the water to get cold. Strain and drink. Crab apples may be used\r\nin the same way.\r\n\r\nAPPLE BEVERAGE NO. 2.--Bake two large, sour apples, and when\r\ntender, sprinkle a tablespoonful of sugar over them, and return to the\r\noven until the sugar is slightly browned. Break and mash the apples with\r\na silver spoon, pour over them a pint of boiling water; cover and let\r\nstand until cold; then strain and serve.\r\n\r\nAPPLE TOAST WATER.--Break a slice of zwieback into small pieces,\r\nand mix with them two or three well-baked tart apples. Pour over all a\r\nquart of boiling water, cover, and let stand until cold, stirring\r\noccasionally. When cold, strain, add sugar to sweeten if desired, and\r\nserve.\r\n\r\nBAKED MILK.--Put a quart of new milk in a stone jar, tie a white\r\npaper over it, and let it stand in a moderately heated oven eight or ten\r\nhours. It becomes of a creamy consistency.\r\n\r\nBARLEY LEMONADE.--Put a half cup of pearl barley into a quart of\r\ncold water, and simmer gently until the water has become mucilaginous\r\nand quite thick. This will take from an hour to an hour and a half. The\r\nbarley will absorb most of the water, but the quantity given should make\r\na teacupful of good, thick barley water. Add to this two teaspoonfuls of\r\nlemon juice and a tablespoonful of sugar. Let it get cold before\r\nserving. By returning the barley to the stewpan with another quart of\r\ncold water, and simmering for an hour or an hour and a half longer, a\r\nsecond cap of barley water may be obtained, almost as good as the first.\r\n\r\nBARLEY AND FRUIT DRINK.--Prepare a barley water as above, and add\r\nto each cupful a tablespoonful or two of cranberry, grape, raspberry, or\r\nany tart fruit syrup. The pure juice sweetened will answer just as well;\r\nor a little fruit jelly may be dissolved and added.\r\n\r\nBARLEY MILK.--Wash two tablespoonfuls of pearl barley in cold water\r\nuntil the water is clear. Put it to cook in a double boiler, with a\r\nquart of milk, and boil till the milk is reduced to a pint. Strain off\r\nthe milk, and sweeten if desired.\r\n\r\nCRANBERRY DRINK.--Mash carefully selected, ripe cranberries\r\nthoroughly in an earthen dish, and pour boiling water over them. Let the\r\nmixture stand until cold, strain off the water, and sweeten to taste.\r\nBarberries prepared in the same manner make a nice drink.\r\n\r\nCURRANTADE.--Mash thoroughly a pint of ripe, red currants, and one\r\nhalf the quantity of red raspberries; add sugar to sweeten and two\r\nquarts of cold water. Stir, strain, cool on ice, and serve.\r\n\r\nCRUST COFFEE.--Brown slices of Graham bread in a slow oven until\r\nvery ark in color. Break in pieces and roll fine with a rolling pin. A\r\nquantity of this material may be prepared at one time and stored in\r\nglass fruit cans for use. When needed, pour a cupful of actively boiling\r\nwater over a dessertspoonful of the prepared crumbs, let it steep for a\r\nfew moments, then strain and serve.\r\n\r\nEGG CREAM.--Beat the white of an egg to a stiff froth, add one\r\ntablespoonful of white sugar, then beat again. Next add the yolk, and\r\nbeat; then a tablespoonful of milk, one of cold water, and one of any\r\nfruit juice desired.\r\n\r\nEGG CREAM NO. 2.--Prepare as above, using two tablespoonfuls of\r\nwater instead of one of water and one of milk, and a teaspoonful of\r\nlemon juice in place of other fruit juice.\r\n\r\nEGG CREAM NO. 3.--Beat the yolk of a freshly laid egg with a\r\ntablespoonful of sugar until it is light and creamy; add to this, one\r\nhalf cup of hot milk and stir in lightly the stiffly beaten white of the\r\negg. Serve at once.\r\n\r\nEGG LEMONADE.--Beat the white of an egg to a stiff froth, then mix\r\nwith it the juice of a small lemon, and one tablespoonful of sugar. Add\r\na half pint of cold water. Or, beat together with an egg beater a\r\ntablespoonful of lemon juice, a teaspoonful of sugar, the white of an\r\negg and a cup of cold water, until thoroughly mingled, then serve at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nFLAXSEED TEA.--Take an ounce of whole flaxseed, half an ounce of\r\ncrushed licorice root, an ounce of refined sugar, and four\r\ntablespoonfuls of lemon juice. Pour a quart of boiling water over them;\r\nkeep near the fire for four hours, and then strain off the liquid. The\r\nflaxseed should not be crushed, as the mucilage is in the outer part of\r\nthe kernel, and if braised, the boiling water will extract the oil of\r\nthe seed, and render the decoction nauseous. Make fresh daily.\r\n\r\nGUM ARABIC WATER.--Pour a pint of boiling water over an ounce of\r\nclean gum arabic. When dissolved, add the juice of one lemon and a\r\nteaspoonful of sugar, and strain.\r\n\r\nHOT WATER.--Put good, fresh water into a perfectly clean\r\ngranite-ware kettle, already warmed; let it come to a boil very quickly,\r\nand use at once. Do not leave it to simmer until it has become insipid\r\nthrough the loss of the air which it contains.\r\n\r\nHOT LEMONADE.--Put in a glass a thin slice of lemon and the juice\r\nof half a small lemon, being careful to remove all seeds; mix with it\r\none dessertspoonful of white sugar, and fill the glass with boiling\r\nwater. Or, remove the peel of a lemon in very thin parings, turn one\r\npint of boiling water over them, letting it stand for a few moments\r\ncovered. Remove the peel, add the juice of a lemon and one tablespoonful\r\nof sugar, and serve.\r\n\r\nIRISH MOSS LEMONADE.--Soak one fourth of a cup of Irish moss in\r\ncold water until it begins to soften; then work it free from sand and\r\ntiny shells likely to be on it, and thoroughly wash. Put it in a\r\ngranite-ware basin, and pour over it two cups of boiling water. Leave on\r\nthe back of the range where it will keep hot, but not boil, for half an\r\nhour; strain, add the juice of one lemon, and sugar to taste. Drink hot\r\nor cold, as preferred.\r\n\r\nORANGEADE.--Rub lightly two ounces of lump sugar on the rind of two\r\nnice, fresh oranges, to extract the flavor; put this sugar into a\r\npitcher, to which add the juice expressed from the oranges, and that\r\nfrom one lemon. Pour over all one pint of cold water, stir thoroughly,\r\nand serve.\r\n\r\nPLAIN LEMONADE.--For one glass of lemonade squeeze the juice of\r\nhalf a small lemon into the glass; carefully remove all seeds and\r\nparticles. Add a dessertspoonful of sugar, and fill the glass with cold\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nSLIPPERY ELM TEA.--Pour boiling water over bits of slippery elm\r\nbark or slippery elm powder, cool, and strain, if desired, a little\r\nlemon juice and sugar may be added to flavor.\r\n\r\nTOAST WATER.--Toast a pint of whole-wheat or Graham bread crusts\r\nvery brown, but do not burn. Cover with a pint of cold water. Let it\r\nstand an hour, strain, and use. Sugar and a little cream may be added if\r\nallowed.\r\n\r\nTAMARIND WATER.--Boil four ounces of tamarinds and the same of\r\nraisins slowly, in three quarts of water, for fifteen or twenty minutes,\r\nor until the water is reduced nearly one fourth; strain while hot into a\r\nbowl with a small slice of lemon peel in it. Set away until cold before\r\nusing.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREAD.\r\n\r\nFor invalids who are able to partake of solid foods, the Breakfast\r\nRolls, Whole-wheat Puffs, Beaten Biscuit, Crisps, and other unfermented\r\nbreads, directions for the preparation of which are given in the chapter\r\non Bread, will be found excellent.\r\n\r\nThe various crackers, wafers, and invalid foods manufactured by the\r\nSanitarium Food Co., Battle Creek, Mich., are also to be recommended.\r\nZwieback, prepared as directed on page 289, will be found serviceable\r\nand wholesome to be used with broths and gruels. It may be prepared so\r\nas to look especially tempting by cutting off the crust of the bread,\r\nand cutting the slice into fancy shapes with a cookie-cutter before\r\ntoasting. In cases where their use is allowable, many of the various\r\ntoasts given under the head of Breakfast Dishes will be relished.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nDIABETIC BISCUIT.--Make a stiff dough of Graham or entire-wheat\r\nflour and water. Knead thoroughly, and let it stand three hours; then\r\nplace on a sieve under a faucet, turn a stream of water over the dough,\r\nand wash out the starch, kneading and working with the hands so that all\r\nportions of the dough will be equally washed. When the starch has been\r\nall washed out, as will be indicated by the water running off clear, the\r\ndough will be a rubber-like, glutinous mass. It may then be cut into\r\nlong strips, and these divided into equal-sized pieces or cubes. Place\r\nthe pieces on shallow baking pans in a rather hot oven, which, after a\r\nshort time, should be allowed to cool to moderate heat, and bake for two\r\nhours, when they should be of a dark, rich brown color and light and\r\ncrisp throughout. If tough, they need rebaking. If the oven is too hot,\r\nthe pieces will puff up, becoming mere hollow shells; if not\r\nsufficiently hot, they will not rise properly.\r\n\r\nDIABETIC BISCUIT NO. 2.--Prepare a dough and wash out the starch as\r\nin the preceding. Add coarse middlings so that the dough can be rolled\r\ninto thin cakes, and bake.\r\n\r\nGLUTEN MEAL GEMS.--Beat together one half cup of ice water, one\r\nhalf cup of thick, sweet cream, and one egg; then add one cup and a\r\ntablespoonful of the gluten meal prepared by the Sanitarium Food Co.\r\nTurn into slightly heated gem irons, and bake in a moderately hot oven\r\nfrom one half to three fourths of an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nJELLIES AND OTHER SIMPLE DESSERTS FOR THE SICK.\r\n\r\nInvalids whose digestion will allow of other than the plainest foods\r\nwill find most of the desserts made with fruits and those with fruits\r\nand grains given in the chapter on Desserts, excellent for their use.\r\nThe following are a few additional recipes of a similar character:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nARROWROOT JELLY.--Rub two heaping teaspoonfuls of arrowroot smooth\r\nin a very little cold water, and stir it into a cupful of boiling water,\r\nin which should be dissolved two teaspoonfuls of sugar. Stir until\r\nclear, allowing it to boil all the time; lastly, add a teaspoonful of\r\nlemon juice. Serve cold, with cream and sugar if allowed.\r\n\r\nARROWROOT BLANCMANGE.--Rub two and a half tablespoonfuls of best\r\narrowroot smooth in half a cup of cold milk, and stir slowly into two\r\nand one half cups of boiling new milk. When it begins to thicken, add\r\nthree fourths of a cup of sugar, and cook, stirring constantly for\r\nseveral minutes. Turn into molds and cool. Serve with fruit juice or\r\nfruit sauces.\r\n\r\nCURRANT JELLY.--Soak an ounce of Cox's gelatine in half a pint of\r\ncold water for fifteen minutes, then pour over it a teacupful of boiling\r\nwater; strain, and add one pint at currant juice, one tablespoonful of\r\nsugar, and set on ice to cool.\r\n\r\nICELAND MOSS JELLY.--Wash about four ounces of moss very clean in\r\nlukewarm water. Boil slowly in a quart of cold water. When quite\r\ndissolved, strain it onto a tablespoonful of currant or raspberry jelly,\r\nstirring so as to blend the jelly perfectly with the moss. Turn into a\r\nmold, and cool.\r\n\r\nICELAND MOSS BLANCMANGE.--Substitute milk for the water, and\r\nproceed as in the foregoing. Flavor with lemon or vanilla. Strain\r\nthrough a muslin cloth, turn into a mold, and let stand till firm and\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nORANGE WHEY.--Add the juice of one sour orange to a pint of sweet\r\nmilk. Heat very slowly until the milk is curded, then strain and cool.\r\n\r\nWHITE CUSTARD.--Beat the whites of three eggs to a stiff froth, add\r\na little salt if desired, and two tablespoonfuls of sugar. A bit of\r\ngrated lemon rind may also be used for flavoring. Add lastly a pint of\r\nnew milk, little by little, beating thoroughly all the while. Bake in\r\ncups set in a pan of hot water. When firm in the center, take out and\r\nset in a cool place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE TOPICS.\r\n\r\n    Regimen is better than physic.--_Voltaire._\r\n\r\n    Many dishes have induced many diseases.--_Seneca._\r\n\r\n    Dr. Lyman Beecher tells the following story of his aunt, which well\r\n    illustrates a popular notion that sick people should be fed with all\r\n    sorts of dainties, no matter what the nature of the disease. When a\r\n    boy eight or nine years of age, he was one day suffering in the\r\n    throes of indigestion, as the result of having swallowed a large\r\n    amount of indigestible mince pie. His kind-hearted aunt noticed the\r\n    pale and distressed look on his face, and said to him, with genuine\r\n    sympathy in her voice, \"Lyman, you look sick. You may go into the\r\n    pantry and help yourself to a nice piece of fruit cake just warm\r\n    from the oven.\"\r\n\r\n    Fix on that course of life which is the most excellent, and custom\r\n    will render it the most delightful.--_Pythagoras._\r\n\r\n    A MERE indigestion can temporarily metamorphose the character. The\r\n    eel stews of Mohammed II. kept the whole empire in a state of\r\n    nervous excitement, and one of the meat-pies which King Philip\r\n    failed to digest caused the revolt of the Netherlands.--_Oswald._\r\n\r\n    Few seem conscious that there is such a thing as physical morality.\r\n    Man's habitual words and acts imply that they are at liberty to\r\n    treat their bodies as they please. The fact is, that all breaches of\r\n    the laws of health are physical sins.--_Herbert Spencer._\r\n\r\n    Practical right and good conduct are much more dependent on health\r\n    of body than on health of mind.--_Prof. Schneider._\r\n\r\n    Dr. Abernathy's reply to the Duke of York when consulted about his\r\n    health was, \"Cut off the supplies and the enemy will soon leave the\r\n    citadel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD FOR THE AGED AND THE VERY YOUNG.\r\n\r\nFOOD FOR THE AGED\r\n\r\nOne of the first requisites of food for the aged is that it shall be\r\neasy of digestion, since with advancing age and decreasing physical\r\nenergy, digestion and assimilation may be taken with impunity at an\r\nearlier period of life, overtax the enfeebled organs and prove highly\r\ninjurious. The fact that the vital machinery is worn and weakened with\r\nage has led to the popular notion that old people require a stimulating\r\ndiet as a \"support\" for their declining forces. That this is an error is\r\napparent from the fact that stimulation either by drink or food lessens\r\ninstead of reinforces vital strength, thus defeating the very purpose\r\ndesired. Flesh food in quantities is a peculiarly unsuitable diet for\r\nthe aged, not alone because it is stimulating, but because it produces a\r\ntendency to plethora, a condition which is especially inimical to the\r\nhealth of old persons. Eminent authorities on diet also reason that the\r\nloss of the teeth at this period, whereby thorough mastication of flesh\r\nfood is done with difficulty, even with the best artificial aids, should\r\nbe considered a sign that nature intends such foods to be discarded by\r\nthe old.\r\n\r\nA milk, grain, and fruit diet is undoubtedly the one best suited to the\r\naverage person in old age. Vegetables and legumes in well-prepared soups\r\nmay also be used to advantage. Directions for such soups, as also for\r\ncooking grains and grain products, will be found in the preceding pages.\r\n\r\nThe following bills of fare, one for each season of the year, will\r\nperhaps serve to illustrate how a varied and appetizing regimen may be\r\nprovided without the use of flesh foods:--\r\n\r\n    BREAKFAST\r\n\r\n    Fresh Fruits\r\n    Graham Grits and Cream\r\n    Prune Toast\r\n    Graham Puffs\r\n    Cream Crisps\r\n    Strawberries\r\n    Caramel Coffee or Hot Milk\r\n\r\n    DINNER\r\n\r\n    Vegetable Broth with Toasted Rolls\r\n    Baked Potato with Pease Gravy\r\n    Stewed Asparagus\r\n    Cracked Wheat and Cream\r\n    Whole-Wheat Bread\r\n    Canned Berries\r\n    Manioca with Fruit\r\n    Caramel Coffee or Hot Milk\r\n\r\n    BREAKFAST\r\n\r\n    Fresh Fruits\r\n    Rolled Oats and Cream\r\n    Baked Sweet Apples\r\n    Macaroni with Cream Sauce\r\n    Whole-Wheat Puffs\r\n    Stewed Peaches\r\n    Caramel Coffee or Hot Milk\r\n\r\n    DINNER\r\n\r\n    Lentil Soup\r\n    Baked Potato with Cream Sauce\r\n    Escalloped Tomato\r\n    Green Corn Pulp\r\n    Browned Rice and Cream\r\n    Fruit Bread\r\n    Lemon Apple Sauce\r\n    Prune Pie\r\n    Caramel Coffee or Hot Milk\r\n\r\n    BREAKFAST\r\n\r\n    Fresh Fruits\r\n    Blackberry Mush and Cream\r\n    Cream Toast\r\n    Graham Crusts\r\n    Blueberries\r\n    Caramel Coffee or Hot Milk\r\n\r\n    DINNER\r\n\r\n    Green Pea Soup\r\n    Mashed Potato\r\n    Macaroni with Tomato Sauce\r\n    Pearl Barley and Cream\r\n    Cream Rolls\r\n    Blackberries\r\n    Stewed Fruit Pudding\r\n    Caramel Coffee or Hot Milk\r\n\r\n    BREAKFAST\r\n\r\n    Fresh Fruits\r\n    Rolled Wheat and Cream\r\n    Tomato Toast\r\n    Corn Bread\r\n    Graham Gems\r\n    Stewed Prunes\r\n    Caramel Coffee or Hot Milk\r\n\r\n    DINNER\r\n\r\n    Vegetable Oyster Soup\r\n    Baked Sweet Potato\r\n    Mashed Peas\r\n    Steamed Rice with Fig Sauce\r\n    Graham Bread\r\n    Stewed Dried Fruit\r\n    Apples\r\n    Caramel Coffee or Hot Milk\r\n\r\nIn the selection of a dietary for elderly persons, much must depend\r\nupon their physical condition, the daily amount of exercise to which\r\nthey are accustomed, their habits in earlier life, and a variety of\r\nother circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe quantity as well as quality of food for the aged should receive\r\nconsideration. Diminished bodily activity and the fact that growth has\r\nceased, render a smaller amount of food necessary to supply needs; and a\r\ndecrease in the amount taken, in proportion to the age and the activity\r\nof the subject, must be made or health will suffer. The system will\r\nbecome clogged, the blood filled with imperfectly elaborated material,\r\nand gout, rheumatism, apoplexy, or other diseased conditions will be the\r\ninevitable result. The digestion of heavy meals is a tax upon vital\r\npowers at any time of life, but particularly so as age advances; and for\r\nhim who has passed his first half-century, over-feeding is fraught with\r\ngreat danger. Cornaro, an Italian of noble family, contemporary with\r\nTitian in the sixteenth century, after reaching his eighty-third year\r\nwrote several essays upon diet and regimen for the aged, in one of which\r\nhe says: \"There are old lovers of feeding who say that it is necessary\r\nthat they should eat and drink a great deal to keep up their natural\r\nheat, which is constantly diminishing as they advance in years; and that\r\nit is therefore their duty to eat heartily and of such things as please\r\ntheir palate, be they hot, cold, or temperate, and that if they were to\r\nlead a sober life, it would be a short one. To this I answer; Our kind\r\nMother Nature, in order that old men may live to still greater age, has\r\ncontrived matters so that they may be able to subsist on little, as I\r\ndo; for large quantities of food cannot be digested by old and feeble\r\nstomachs.\"\r\n\r\nCornaro lived to be one hundred years old, doubtless owing largely to\r\nhis simple, frugal habits.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIET FOR THE YOUNG.\r\n\r\nA very large share of the mortality among young children results from\r\ndietetic errors which proper knowledge and care on the part of those who\r\nhave them in charge might commonly avoid. From infancy to the age of\r\ntwelve or eighteen months, milk is the natural and proper food. Milk\r\ncontains all the food elements except starch, which cannot be digested\r\nby very young children, owing to the insufficient formation of digestive\r\nelements of the salivary secretion during the first few months. If the\r\nchild is deprived of the milk provided by nature, the best artificial\r\nfood is cow's milk; it, however, requires very careful selection and\r\nintelligent preparation. The animal from which the milk comes, should be\r\nperfectly healthy and well cared for. The quality of her food should\r\nalso receive attention, as there is little doubt that disease is often\r\ncommunicated to infants by milk from cows improperly fed and cared for.\r\nAn eminent medical authority offers the following important points on\r\nthis subject:--\r\n\r\n\"The cow selected for providing the food for an infant should be between\r\nthe ages of four and ten years, of mild disposition, and one which has\r\nbeen giving milk from four to eight weeks. She should be fed on good,\r\nclean grain, and hay free from must. Roots, if any are fed, should be of\r\ngood quality, and she should have plenty of good clean water from a\r\nliving spring or well. Her pasture should be timothy grass or native\r\ngrass free from weeds; clover alone is bad. She should be cleaned and\r\ncared for like a carriage horse, and milked twice a day by the same\r\nperson and at the same time. Some cows are unfit by nature for feeding\r\ninfants.\"\r\n\r\nMilk from the same animal should be used if possible. Changing from one\r\ncow's milk to another, or the use of such milk as is usually supplied by\r\ncity milkmen, often occasions serious results. The extraction of the\r\nheat from the milk immediately after milking and before it is used or\r\ncarried far, especially in hot weather, is essential. While the milk\r\nitself should be clean and pure, it should also be perfectly fresh and\r\nwithout any trace of decomposition. To insure all these requisites,\r\nbesides great care in its selection, it must be sterilized, and if not\r\nintended for immediate use, bottled and kept in a cool place until\r\nneeded. It is not safe to feed young children upon unsterilized milk\r\nthat has stood a few hours. Even fresh milk from the cleanest cows,\r\nunless drawn into bottles and sealed at once, contains many germs. These\r\nlittle organisms, the cause of fermentation and decomposition, multiply\r\nvery rapidly in milk, and as they increase, dangers from the use of the\r\nmilk increase.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that cholera infantum and other digestive disturbances\r\ncommon among young children would be greatly lessened by the use of\r\nproperly sterilized milk. Directions for sterilizing milk, and\r\nadditional suggestions respecting points to be considered in its\r\nselection, are to be found in the chapter on Milk, etc.\r\n\r\nCow's milk differs from human milk in that it contains nearly three\r\ntimes as much casein, but only two thirds as much fat and three fourths\r\nas much sugar. Cow's milk is usually slightly acid, while human milk is\r\nalkaline. The casein of cow's milk forms large, hard curds, while that\r\nof breast milk forms fine, soft curds. These facts make it important\r\nthat some modification be made in cow's milk to render it acceptable to\r\nthe feeble stomach of an infant. Cases are rare where it is safe to feed\r\na child under nine months of age on pure, undiluted cow's milk. A common\r\nmethod of preparing cow's milk so as to make it suitable for infant\r\nfeeding, is to dilute it with pure water, using at first only one third\r\nor one fourth milk, the proportion of milk being gradually increased as\r\nthe child's stomach becomes accustomed to the food and able to bear it,\r\nuntil at the age of four months the child should be taking equal parts\r\nof milk and water. When sterilized milk is to be thus diluted, the water\r\nshould be first boiled or added before sterilizing. A small amount of\r\nfine white sugar, or what is better, milk sugar, should be added to the\r\ndiluted milk. Barley water, and thin, well-boiled, and carefully\r\nstrained oatmeal gruel thoroughly blended with the milk are also used\r\nfor this purpose. A food which approximates more nearly the constituents\r\nof mother's milk may be prepared as follows:--\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL HUMAN MILK NO. 1.--Blend one fourth pint of fresh, sweet\r\ncream and three fourths of a pint of warm water. Add one half ounce of\r\nmilk sugar and from two to ten ounces of milk, according to the age of\r\nthe infant and its digestive capacity.\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL HUMAN MILK NO. 2.--Meigs's formula: Take two\r\ntablespoonfuls of cream of medium quality, one tablespoonful of milk,\r\ntwo of lime water, and three of water to which sugar of milk has been\r\nadded in the proportion of seventeen and three fourths drams to the\r\npint. This saccharine solution must be prepared fresh every day or two\r\nand kept in a cool place. A child may be allowed from half a pint to\r\nthree pints of this mixture, according to age.\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL HUMAN MILK NO. 3.--Prepare a barley water by adding one\r\npint boiling water to a pint of best pearl barley. Allow it to cool, and\r\nstrain. Mix together one third of a pint of this barley water, two\r\nthirds of a pint of fresh, pure milk, and a teaspoonful of milk\r\nsugar.--_Medical News._\r\n\r\nPeptonized milk, a formula for the preparation of which may be found on\r\npage 426, is also valuable as food for infants, especially for those of\r\nweak digestion.\r\n\r\nMUCILAGINOUS FOOD EXCELLENT IN GASTRO-ENTERITIS.--Wheat, one\r\ntablespoonful; oatmeal, one half tablespoonful; barley, one half\r\ntablespoonful; water, one quart. Boil to one pint, strain, and\r\nsweeten.--_Dietetic Gazette._\r\n\r\nPREPARED FOODS FOR INFANTS.--Of prepared infant foods we can\r\nrecommend that manufactured by the Sanitarium Food Co., Battle Creek,\r\nMich., as thoroughly reliable. There are hundreds of prepared infant\r\nfoods in the market, but most of them are practically worthless in point\r\nof food value, being often largely composed of starch, a substance which\r\nthe immature digestive organs of a young child are incapable of\r\ndigesting. Hundreds of infants are yearly starved to death upon such\r\nfoods.\r\n\r\nAll artificial foods require longer time for digestion than the food\r\nsupplied by nature; and when making use of such, great care should be\r\ntaken to avoid too frequent feeding. It is absolutely essential for the\r\nperfect health of an infant as well as of grown people, that the\r\ndigestive organs shall enjoy a due interval of rest between the\r\ndigestion of one meal and the taking of another. As a rule, a new-born\r\ninfant may be safely fed, when using human milk, not oftener than once\r\nin every three or four hours. When fed upon artificial food, once in\r\nfive or six hours is often enough for feeding. The intervals between\r\nmeals in either case should be gradually prolonged as the child grows\r\nolder.\r\n\r\nQUANTITY OF FOOD FOR INFANTS.--Dr. J.H. Kellogg gives the following\r\nrules and suggestions for the feeding of infants:--\r\n\r\n\"During the first week of a child's life, the weight of the food given\r\nshould be 1/100 of the weight of the infant at birth. The daily\r\nadditional amount of food required for a child amounts to about one\r\nfourth of a dram, or about one ounce at the end of each month. A child\r\ngains in weight from two thirds of an ounce to one ounce per day during\r\nthe first five months of its life, and an average of one half as much\r\ndaily during the balance of the first year.\r\n\r\n\"From a series of tables which have been prepared, as the result of\r\nexperiments carefully conducted in large lying-in establishments, we\r\nhave devised this rule:--\r\n\r\n\"To find the amount of food required by a child at each feeding during\r\nthe first year of life, divide the weight of the child at birth by 100\r\nand add to this amount 3/100 of the gain which the child has made since\r\nbirth. Take, for example, a child which weighs 7-1/2 lbs--at birth, or\r\n120 ounces. Dividing by 100 we have 1.2 oz. Estimating the weight\r\naccording to the rule above given, the child at the end of nine months\r\nwill have gained 210 oz. Dividing this by 100 and multiplying by 3, we\r\nhave 6.3 oz. Adding to this our previous result, 1.3, we have 7.5 oz, as\r\nthe amount of food required at each feeding at the end of nine months by\r\na child which weighed 7-1/2 lbs. at birth. To save mothers the trouble\r\nof making these calculations, we have prepared the following table,\r\nwhich will be found to hold good for the average child weighing 7-1/2\r\nlbs. at birth. This is rather more than the ordinary child weighs, but\r\nwe have purposely chosen a large child for illustration, as it is better\r\nthat the child should have a slight excess of food than too little.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                AGE OF CHILD.\r\n                                       |1w.| 1m. |2m.|3m.|4m.|6m.|9m.|12m\r\n    Amount of each feeding in ounces...|  1| 1½-2| 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |7½ | 9\r\n    Number of feedings.................| 10|  8  | 6 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 5 | 5\r\n    Amount of food daily, in ounces....| 10|12-16|18 |24 |30 |36 |37½|45\r\n    Interval between feedings, in hours|  2| 2½  | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 |3½ |3½\r\n\r\n\"In the above table the first column represents quantities for the first\r\nweek, the second for the end of the second month, the third for the end\r\nof the third month, etc. It need not be mentioned that the change in\r\nquantity should be even more gradual than represented in the table.\r\n\r\n\"Attention should also be called to the fact that the time mentioned as\r\nthe interval for feeding at different ages, does not apply to the whole\r\ntwenty-four hours. Even during the first week, the child is expected to\r\nskip two feedings during the night, making the interval four hours\r\ninstead of two. By the end of the second month, the interval between the\r\nfeedings at night becomes six hours, and at the end of the ninth month,\r\nsix and one half hours.\r\n\r\n\"From personal observation we judge that in many cases children will do\r\nequally well if allowed a longer interval between feedings at night. The\r\nplan of feeding five times daily instead of six, may be begun at as\r\nearly an age as six months in many instances.\"\r\n\r\nMANNER OF FEEDING ARTIFICIAL FOODS.--All artificial foods are best\r\nfed with a teaspoon, as by this method liability to over-feeding and\r\ndanger from unclean utensils are likely to be avoided. If a\r\nnursing-bottle is used, it should be of clear flint glass so that the\r\nslightest foulness may be easily detected, and one simple in\r\nconstruction, which can be completely taken apart for cleaning. Those\r\nfurnished with conical black rubber caps are the best. Each time after\r\nusing, such a bottle should have the cap removed, and both bottle and\r\ncap should be thoroughly cleansed, first with cold water, and then with\r\nwarm water in which soda has been dissolved in the proportion of a\r\nteaspoonful to a pint of water. They should then be kept immersed in\r\nweak soda solution until again needed, when both bottle and cap should\r\nbe thoroughly rinsed in clean boiled water before they are used. Neglect\r\nto observe these precautions is one of the frequent causes of stomach\r\ndisturbances in young children. It is well to keep two bottles for\r\nfeeding, using them alternately.\r\n\r\nDIET FOR OLDER CHILDREN.--No solid food or table-feeding of any\r\nkind should be given to a child until it has the larger share of its\r\nfirst, or milk teeth. Even then it must not be supposed that because a\r\nchild has acquired its teeth, it may partake of all kinds of food with\r\nimpunity. It is quite customary for mothers to permit their little ones\r\nto sit at the family table and be treated to bits of everything upon the\r\nbill of fare, apparently looking upon them as miniature grown people,\r\nwith digestive ability equal to persons of mature growth, but simply\r\nlacking in, stomach capacity to dispose of as much as older members of\r\nthe family. The digestive apparatus of a child differs so greatly from\r\nthat of an adult in its anatomical structure and in the character and\r\namount of the digestive fluids, that it is by no means proper to allow a\r\nchild to eat all kinds of wholesome foods which a healthy adult stomach\r\ncan consume with impunity, to say nothing of the rich, highly seasoned\r\nviands, sweetmeats, and epicurean dishes which seldom fail to form some\r\npart of the bill of fare. It is true that many children are endowed with\r\nso much constitutional vigor that they do live and seemingly thrive,\r\nnotwithstanding dietetic errors; but the integrity of the digestive\r\norgans is liable to be so greatly impaired by continued ill-treatment\r\nthat sooner or later in life disease results. Till the age of three\r\nyears, sterilized milk, whole-wheat bread in its various forms, such of\r\nthe grains as contain a large share of gluten, prepared in a variety of\r\npalatable ways, milk and fruit toasts, and the easily digested fruits,\r\nboth raw and cooked, form the best dietary. Strained vegetable soups may\r\nbe occasionally added for variety. For from three to six years the same\r\nsimple regimen, with easily digested and simply prepared vegetables,\r\nmacaroni, and legumes prepared without skins, will be all-sufficient. If\r\ndesserts are desirable, let them be simple in character and easily\r\ndigestible. Tea, coffee, hot bread and biscuit, fried foods of all\r\nkinds, salted meats, preserves, rich puddings, cake, and pastries should\r\nbe wholly discarded from the children's bill of fare.\r\n\r\nIt is especially important that a dietary for children should contain an\r\nabundance of nitrogenous material. It is needed not only for repairs,\r\nbut must be on deposit for the purpose of food. Milk, whole-wheat bread,\r\noatmeal, barley, and preparations of wheat, contain this element in\r\nabundance, and should for this reason be given great prominence in the\r\nchildren's dietary.\r\n\r\nFlesh foods are in no way necessary for children, since the food\r\nelements of which they are composed can be supplied from other and\r\nbetter sources, and many prominent medical authorities unite in the\r\nopinion that such foods are decidedly deleterious, and should not be\r\nused at all by children under eight or ten years of age. Experiments\r\nmade by Dr. Camman, of New York, upon the dietary of nearly two hundred\r\nyoung children in an orphan's home, offer conclusive evidence that the\r\ndeath rate among children from gastro-intestinal troubles is greatly\r\nlessened by the exclusion of meat from their dietary. Dr. Clouston, of\r\nEdinburgh, an eminent medical authority, states that in his experience,\r\nthose children who show the greatest tendencies to instability of the\r\nbrain, insanity, and immoral habits are, as a rule, those who use animal\r\nfood in excess; and that he has seen a change of diet to milk and\r\nfarinaceous food produce a marked change in their nervous irritability.\r\n\r\nScores of other authorities corroborate. Dr. Clouston's observation, and\r\nassert that children fed largely on flesh foods have capricious\r\nappetites, suffer more commonly from indigestion in its various forms,\r\npossess an unstable nervous system, and have less resisting power in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nCandy and similar sweets generally given to children as a matter of\r\ncourse, may be excluded from their dietary with positive benefit in\r\nevery way. It is true, as is often stated in favor of the use of these\r\narticles, that sugar is a food element needed by children; but the\r\namount required for the purpose of growth and repair is comparatively\r\nsmall, and is supplied in great abundance in bread, grains, fruits, and\r\nother common articles of food. If an additional quantity is taken, it is\r\nnot utilized by the system, and serves only to derange digestion, impair\r\nappetite, and indirectly undermine the health.\r\n\r\nChildren are not likely to crave candy and other sweets unless a taste\r\nfor such articles has been developed by indulgence in them; and their\r\nuse, since they are seldom taken at mealtime, helps greatly to foster\r\nthat most pernicious habit of childhood--eating between meals. No food,\r\nexcept at their regular mealtimes, should be the universal rule for\r\nchildren from babyhood up; and although during their earliest years they\r\nrequire food at somewhat shorter intervals than adults, their meal hours\r\nshould be arranged for the same time each day, and no piecing permitted.\r\nParents who follow the too common practice of giving their little ones a\r\ncracker or fruit between meals are simply placing them under training\r\nfor dyspepsia, sooner or later. Uninterrupted digestion proceeds\r\nsmoothly and harmoniously in a healthy stomach; but interruptions in the\r\nshape of food sent down at all times and when the stomach is already at\r\nwork, are justly resented, and such disturbances, if long continued, are\r\npunished by suffering.\r\n\r\nThe appetite of a child is quite as susceptible of education, in both a\r\nright and wrong direction, as are its mental or moral faculties; and\r\nparents in whose hands this education mainly rests should give the\r\nsubject careful consideration, since upon it the future health and\r\nusefulness of their children not a little devolve. We should all be\r\nrulers of our appetites instead of subject to them; but whether this be\r\nso or not, depends greatly upon early dietetic training. Many a loving\r\nmother, by thoughtless indulgence of her child, in season and out of\r\nseason, in dainties and tidbits that simply serve to gratify the palate,\r\nis fostering a \"love of appetite\" which may ruin her child in years to\r\ncome. There are inherited appetites and tendencies, it is true; but even\r\nthese may be largely overcome by careful early training in right ways of\r\neating and drinking. It is possible to teach very young children to use\r\nsuch food as is best for them, and to refrain from the eating of things\r\nharmful; and it should be one of the first concerns of every mother to\r\nstart her children on the road to manhood and womanhood, well trained in\r\ncorrect dietetic habits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE TOPICS.\r\n\r\n     \"The wanton taste no flesh nor fowl can choose,\r\n     For which the grape or melon it would lose,\r\n     Though all th' inhabitants of earth and air\r\n     Be listed in the glutton's bill of fare.\"\r\n\r\n    --_Cowley._\r\n\r\n    Jean Jacques Rousseau holds that intemperate habits are mostly\r\n    acquired in early boyhood, when blind deference to social precedents\r\n    is apt to overcome our natural antipathies, and that those who have\r\n    passed that period in safety, have generally escaped the danger of\r\n    temptation. The same holds good of other dietetic abuses. If a\r\n    child's natural aversion to vice has never been wilfully perverted,\r\n    the time will come when his welfare may be intrusted to the\r\n    safe-keeping of his protective instincts. You need not fear that he\r\n    will swerve from the path of health when his simple habits,\r\n    sanctioned by nature and inclination, have acquired the additional\r\n    strength of long practice. When the age of blind deference is past,\r\n    vice is generally too unattractive to be very dangerous.--_Oswald._\r\n\r\n    That a child inherits certain likes and dislikes in the matter of\r\n    food cannot be questioned, and does not in the least forbid the\r\n    training of the child's taste toward that which is healthful and\r\n    upbuilding; it merely adds an element to be considered in the\r\n    training.--_Sel._\r\n\r\n    Prevention is better than cure. It is worth a life effort to lift a\r\n    man from degradation. To prevent his fall is better.--_Gough._\r\n\r\n\r\n    A cynical French writer of the last century intending a satire upon\r\n    the principles of vegetarianism adopted by Phillippe Hecquet, puts\r\n    into the mouth of one of the characters in his book what, in the\r\n    grossly voluptuous life of that country and time, the author no\r\n    doubt imagined to be the greatest absurdities conceivable in\r\n    reference to diet, but which, in the light of present civilization\r\n    are but the merest hygienic truths. A doctor had been called to a\r\n    gouty and fever-stricken patient. \"Pray what is your ordinary diet?\"\r\n    asked the physician.\r\n\r\n    \"My usual food,\" replied the patient, \"is broth and juicy meat.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Broth and juicy meat!\" cried the doctor, alarmed. \"I do not wonder\r\n    to find you sick; such dishes are poisoned pleasures and snares that\r\n    luxury spreads for mankind, so as to ruin them the more\r\n    effectually.... How old are you, pray?\"\r\n\r\n    \"I am in my sixty-ninth year,\" replied the patient.\r\n\r\n    \"Exactly,\" ... said the physician; \"if you had drunk nothing else\r\n    than pure water all your life, and had been satisfied with simple\r\n    nourishment,--such as boiled apples for example,--you would not now\r\n    be tormented with the gout, and all your limbs would perform their\r\n    functions with ease.\"\r\n\r\n    Dr. Horace Bushnell says: \"The child is taken when his training\r\n    begins in a state of naturalness as respects all the bodily tastes\r\n    and tempers, and the endeavour should be to keep him in that key, to\r\n    let no stimulation of excess or delicacy disturb the simplicity of\r\n    nature, and no sensual pleasure in the name of food become a want or\r\n    expectation of his appetite. Any artificial appetite begun is the\r\n    beginning of distemper, disease, and a general disturbance of\r\n    natural proportion. Nine tenths of the intemperate drinking begins,\r\n    not in grief and destitution, as we so often hear, but in vicious\r\n    feeding.\"\r\n\r\n    Always let the food be simply for nourishment--never more, never\r\n    less. Never should food be taken for its own sake, but for the sake\r\n    of promoting bodily and mental activity. Still less should the\r\n    peculiarities of food, its taste or delicacy ever become an object\r\n    in themselves, but only a means to make it good, pure, wholesome\r\n    nourishment; else in both cases the food destroys\r\n    health.--_Froebel._\r\n\r\n     Since what need mortals, save twain things alone,\r\n     Crushed grain (heaven's gift), and steaming water-draught?\r\n     Food nigh at hand, and Nature's aliment--\r\n     Of which no glut contents us.\r\n     Pampered taste hunts out device of other eatables.\r\n\r\n    --_Euripides._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRAGMENTS & LEFT-OVER FOODS\r\n\r\nEconomy, one of the cardinal principles of success in the details of\r\nhousekeeping, as in all other occupations in life, consists not alone in\r\nmaking advantageous use of fresh material, but in carefully preserving\r\nand utilizing the \"left-over\" fragments and bits of food which accrue in\r\nevery household. Few cooks can make such perfect calculation respecting\r\nthe desires and needs of their families as to provide just enough and no\r\nmore, and the improvident waste of the surplus thus prepared, is in many\r\nhomes fully equal to one half the first cost of the meal. Scarcely\r\nanything need ever be wasted--certainly nothing which was at first well\r\ncooked. There are ways of utilizing almost every kind of cooked food so\r\nthat it will be quite as appetizing and nutritious as when first\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\nAll left-over foods, as grains, vegetables, or others of a moist\r\ncharacter, should be removed to clean dishes before putting away. Unless\r\nthis precaution is observed, the thin smears and tiny bits about the\r\nedges of the dish, which become sour or moldy much sooner than the\r\nlarger mass, are apt to spoil the whole. They should also be set on ice\r\nor be kept in a cool, dry place until needed. Left-over foods of any\r\nkind, to be suitable again for use, must be well preserved. Sour or\r\nmoldy fragments are not fit for food.\r\n\r\nUSES OF STALE BREAD.--If properly made from wholesome and\r\nnutritious material and well preserved, there are few other foods that\r\ncan be combined into more varied and palatable dishes than left-over\r\nbread. To insure the perfect preservation of the fragments, the loaf\r\nitself should receive good care. Perfectly sweet, light, well-baked\r\nbread has not the same propensity to mold as a poorer loaf; but the best\r\nof bread is likely to become musty if its surroundings are not entirely\r\nwholesome. The receptacle used for keeping the loaves should be\r\nfrequently washed, scalded, and well dried. Crumbs and fragments should\r\nbe kept in a separate receptacle and as thoroughly cared for. It is well\r\nin cutting bread not to slice more than will be needed, and to use one\r\nloaf before beginning on another. Bread grows stale much faster after\r\nbeing cut.\r\n\r\nWhole or half slices of bread which have become too dry to be palatable\r\nmay be utilized for making zwieback, directions for the use and\r\npreparation of which are given on page 289.\r\n\r\nBroken pieces of bread not suitable for zwieback, crusts, and trimmings\r\nof the loaf make excellent _croutons_, a most palatable accompaniment\r\nfor soups, gruels, hot milk, etc. To prepare the _croutons_ cut the\r\nfragments as nearly uniform in size as possible,--half-inch cubes are\r\nconvenient,--and place them on tins in a warming oven to dry. Let them\r\nbecome crisply dry, and lightly browned, but not scorched. They are\r\npreferable to crackers for use in soups, and require so little work to\r\nprepare, and are so economical withal, that one who has once tried them\r\nwill be likely to keep a supply on hand. The crumbs and still smaller\r\nfragments may be utilized for thickening soups and for various dressings\r\nand puddings, recipes for many of which are given in preceding chapters.\r\n\r\nIf crumbs and small bits of bread accumulate more rapidly than they can\r\nbe used, they may be carefully dried, not browned, in a warming oven,\r\nafter which put them in a mortar and pound them, or spread them upon an\r\nold bread board, fold in a clean cloth and roll them with a rolling pin\r\nuntil fine. Prepared thus, stored in glass fruit cans and put away in a\r\ndry place, they will keep almost indefinitely, and can be used when\r\nneeded. For preparing escalloped vegetables of all kinds, these prepared\r\ncrumbs are excellent; they give a fine, nutty flavor to the dish, which\r\nfresh crumbs do not possess.\r\n\r\nLEFT-OVER GRAINS.--Left-over grains, if well kept, may be reheated\r\nin a double boiler without the addition of water, so as to be quite as\r\npalatable as when freshly cooked. Small quantities of left-over grains\r\ncan be utilized for preparing various kinds of desserts, where the\r\ningredients require previous cooking. Rice, barley, pearl wheat, and\r\nother whole grains can be satisfactorily used in soups in which a whole\r\ngrain is required; oatmeal, rolled oats, corn meal, grits, etc., with\r\nthe addition of a little milk and cream, may be made into delicious\r\ngruels; they may also be used advantageously in the preparation of\r\nvegetable soups, many of which are even improved by the addition of a\r\nfew spoonfuls of well-kept cooked oatmeal or rolled oats. The left-over\r\ngrains may also be utilized in a variety of breads, directions for the\r\npreparation of which are given in the chapter on Bread.\r\n\r\nLEFT-OVER VEGETABLES.--Left-over portions of most varieties of\r\nvegetables can be best utilized for soups as stated on page 275. Cold\r\nmashed potato may be made into potato cakes as directed on page 237 of\r\nthe chapter on Vegetables, where will also be found many other recipes,\r\nsuited to the use of these left-over foods.\r\n\r\nLEFT-OVER MEATS.--Most cook books offer numerous recipes for\r\ncroquettes, hashes, and fried dishes prepared from remnants of meat and\r\nfish, which, although they serve the purpose of using up the fragments,\r\nare not truly economical, because they are generally far from wholesome.\r\nMost fragments of this character are more digestible served cold as a\r\nrelish, or utilized for soups and stews, than compounded into fancy\r\ndishes requiring to be fried and highly seasoned or served with rich\r\nsauces.\r\n\r\nLEFT-OVER MILK.--Small quantities of unsterilized milk or cream\r\nleft over should always be carefully scalded, then cooled at once to a\r\ntemperature of 60,° and put in a cool place, in order to keep it sweet\r\nand fresh until the next meal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE TOPICS.\r\n\r\n    \"Care preserves what Industry gains.

The gifts of Cerea and water are sufficient nourishment\r\n    for all peoples.--_Pharsalia._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ART OF DINING\r\n\r\nHuman nature is so susceptible to externals, while good digestion is so\r\ndependent upon interior conditions, that all the accessories of pleasant\r\nsurroundings--neatness, cheeriness, and good breeding--should be brought\r\ninto requisition for the daily gathering of the family at mealtime. The\r\ndining room should be one of the airiest, choicest rooms in the house,\r\nwith a pleasant outlook, and, if possible, with east windows, that the\r\nmorning sun may gladden the breakfast hour with its cheering rays. Let\r\nplants, flowers, birds, and pictures have a place in its appointments,\r\nthat the association with things bright and beautiful may help to set\r\nthe keynote of our own lives in cheerful accord. A dark, gloomy,\r\nill-ventilated room brings depression of spirits, and will make the most\r\nelaborate meal unsatisfactory; while the plainest meal may seem almost a\r\nfeast when served amid attractive surroundings. Neatness is an important\r\nessential; any home, however humble, may possess cleanliness and order,\r\nand without these, all charms of wealth and art are of little account.\r\n\r\nA thorough airing each morning and opening of the windows a few minutes\r\nafter each meal to remove the odor of food, are important items in the\r\ncare of the dining room. The furnishing may be simple and\r\ninexpensive,--beauty in a home is not dependent upon expense,--but let\r\nit be substantial, tasteful, harmonious in color and soft in tone,\r\nnothing gaudy or showy. Use no heavy draperies, and have no excess of\r\nornament and bric-a-brac to catch dust and germs. A hard-finished wood\r\nfloor is far superior to a carpet in point of healthfulness, and quite\r\nas economical and easy to keep clean. The general furnishing of the\r\nroom, besides the dining table and chairs, should include a sideboard,\r\nupon which may be arranged the plate and glassware, with drawers for\r\ncutlery and table linen; also a side-table for extra dishes needed\r\nduring the service of a meal.\r\n\r\nAn open fireplace, when it can be afforded, aids in ventilation as well\r\nas increases the cheerful aspect of the room.\r\n\r\nA moveable china closet with glass encasements for keeping the daintier\r\nchina, glass, or silver ware not in common use is often a desirable\r\narticle of furniture in small homes; or a shallow closet may be built in\r\nthe wall of the dining-room for this purpose. A good size for such a\r\ncloset is twelve inches deep and three feet wide. Four shelves, with one\r\nor more drawers below, in which may be kept the best table napery,\r\nafford ample space in general. The appearance of the whole may be made\r\nvery pleasing by using doors of glass, and filling in the back and sides\r\nof the shelves with velvet paper in dark-brown, dull-red, or any shade\r\nsuitable for background, harmonizing with the general furnishing of the\r\nroom. The shelves should be of the same material and have the same\r\nfinish as the woodwork of the room. The upper side may be covered with\r\nfelt if desired; and such artistic taste may be displayed in the\r\narrangement of the china as to make the closet ornamental as well as\r\nconvenient.\r\n\r\nTABLE-TALK.--A sullen, silent meal is a direct promoter of\r\ndyspepsia. \"Laugh and grow fat\" is an ancient adage embodying good\r\nhygienic doctrine. It has long been well understood that food digests\r\nbetter when seasoned with agreeable conversation, and it is important\r\nthat unpleasant topics should be avoided. Mealtime should not be made\r\nthe occasion to discuss troubles, trials, and misfortunes, which rouse\r\nonly gloomy thoughts, impair digestion, and leave one at the close of\r\nthe meal worried and wearied rather than refreshed and strengthened. Let\r\nvexatious questions be banished from the family board. Fill the time\r\nwith bright, sparkling conversation, but do not talk business or discuss\r\nneighborhood gossip. Do not let the food upon the table furnish the\r\ntheme of conversation; neither praise nor apology are in good taste.\r\nParents who make their food thus an especial topic of conversation are\r\ninstilling into their children's minds a notion that eating is the best\r\npart of life, whereas it is only a means to a higher end, and should be\r\nso considered. Of all family gatherings the meals should be the most\r\ngenial and pleasant, and with a little effort they may be made most\r\nprofitable to all. It is said of Dr. Franklin that he derived his\r\npeculiarly practical turn of mind from his father's table talk.\r\n\r\nLet themes of conversation be of general interest, in which all may take\r\na part. If there are children, a pleasant custom for the breakfast hour\r\nis to have each in turn relate something new and instructive, that he or\r\nshe has read or learned in the interval since the breakfast hour of the\r\nprevious day. This stimulates thought and conversational power, while\r\nmusic, history, adventure, politics, and all the arts and sciences offer\r\nample scope for securing interesting items.\r\n\r\nAnother excellent plan is the selection of a special topic for\r\nconversation for each meal or for the meals of a day or a week, a\r\nprevious announcement of the topic being made, that all, even the\r\nyoungest, may have time to prepare something to say of it. The benefits\r\nfrom such social intercourse around the board can hardly be\r\nover-estimated; and if thus the mealtime is prolonged, and too much\r\nappears to be taken out of the busy day, be sure it will add to their\r\nyears in the end, by increasing health and happiness.\r\n\r\nTABLE MANNERS.--Good breeding and true refinement are nowhere more\r\napparent than in manners at table. These do not relate alone to the\r\nproper use of knife and fork, napkin and spoon, but to habits of\r\npunctuality, neatness, quietness, order, and that kind thoughtfulness\r\nand courteous attention which spring from the heart--\"in honor\r\npreferring one another.\" The purpose of eating should not be merely the\r\nappeasement of hunger or the gratification of the palate, but the\r\nacquiring of strength for labor or study, that we may be better fitted\r\nfor usefulness in the world. Consequently, we should eat like\r\nresponsible beings, and not like the lower orders of animals.\r\n\r\nGood table manners cannot be put on for special occasions and laid aside\r\nlike a garment. Persons not wont to observe the rules of politeness in\r\nthe every-day life of their own households can never deceive others into\r\nthinking them well bred on \"company\" occasions. Ease and refinement of\r\nmanners are only acquired by habitual practice, and parents should early\r\naccustom their children by both precept and example to observe the\r\nrequirements of good behavior and politeness at table. Elaborate details\r\nare not necessary. We subjoin a few of the more simple rules governing\r\ntable etiquette:--\r\n\r\n1. Eat slowly, never filling the mouth very full and avoiding all\r\nappearance of greediness.\r\n\r\n2. Masticate thoroughly, keeping the lips closed. Eating and drinking\r\nshould be noiseless.\r\n\r\n3. Never speak with the mouth full, nor interrupt another when talking.\r\nAny remark worthy of utterance will keep.\r\n\r\n4. Do not express a choice for any particular portion or dish, unless\r\nrequested to do so; and do not find fault with the food. If by chance\r\nanything unpleasant is found in it, do not call the attention of others\r\nto the fact by either remark or manner.\r\n\r\n5. Sit conveniently near the table, but not crowded up close against it;\r\nand keep the hands, when not in use to convey food to the mouth, in the\r\nlap, beneath the table, never resting upon the table, toying with knife,\r\nfork, or spoon.\r\n\r\n6. Do not tilt back your chair, or lean upon the table with the elbow,\r\nor drum with the fingers.\r\n\r\n7. It is contrary to good breeding to shovel one's food into the mouth\r\nwith a knife. Everything which can be eaten with a fork should be taken\r\nwith that utensil alone. If necessary, use the knife for dividing the\r\nfood, and afterward the fork to convey it to the mouth. Use a spoon for\r\nsoups and juicy foods.\r\n\r\n8. Bread should be broken, not cut. In eating large fruits, like apples\r\nor pears, divide with a knife, and take in small portions, holding the\r\nknife by the handle rather than the blade.\r\n\r\n9. Soup is eaten from the side of the spoon, which is filled without\r\nnoisily touching the plate.\r\n\r\n10. Seeds or stones to be rejected should be taken from the lips with a\r\nspoon, never with the fingers. The mouth should not go to the food, but\r\nthe food to the mouth.\r\n\r\n11. Do not crumble food about your plate, nor in any avoidable way soil\r\nthe table linen.\r\n\r\n12. Do not hang the napkin about the neck like a bib, but unfold and lay\r\nacross the lap in such a manner that it will not slide to the floor.\r\nCarefully wipe the mouth before speaking, and as often at other times as\r\nmay keep the lips perfectly clean of food and drink. At the close of a\r\nmeal, if at home, fold the napkin neatly and place it in the ring. If at\r\na hotel or away from home, leave the napkin unfolded by your plate.\r\n\r\n13. Do not appear impatient to be served, and ordinarily at the home\r\nmeals wait until all are served before commencing to eat. At a public\r\ntable where waiters are provided, it is proper to begin eating as soon\r\nas the food is served. This is admissible because the wants of other\r\nguests are supposed to be similarly looked after.\r\n\r\n14. Never reach across a neighbor's plate for anything. If something\r\nbeyond him is needed, ask to have it passed to you.\r\n\r\n15. Do not tilt your plate or scrape it for the last atom of food.\r\n\r\n16. Drink very sparingly, if at all, while eating, and then do not pour\r\nthe liquid down the throat like water turned from a pitcher.\r\n\r\n17. Children should not be allowed to use their fingers to aid\r\nthemselves in eating. If their hands are too small or too awkward to\r\nuse a fork, a piece of bread or cracker may be held in the left hand to\r\naid in pushing the food upon the fork or spoon.\r\n\r\n18. To help one's self to butter or any other food from a common dish\r\nwith one's own knife or spoon is a gross breach of table etiquette.\r\n\r\n19. Never use the handkerchief unnecessarily at the table, and do not\r\ncough or sneeze if avoidable.\r\n\r\n20. It is not considered proper to pick the teeth at table. If this\r\nbecomes absolutely necessary, a napkin should be held before the mouth.\r\n\r\n21. When a meal or course is finished, lay the knife and fork side by\r\nside upon the plate.\r\n\r\n22. Except at a hotel or boarding house, it is not proper to leave the\r\ntable before the rest of the family or guests, without asking the\r\nhostess to excuse you.\r\n\r\n23. If a guest declines a dish, he need give no reason. \"No, I thank\r\nyou,\" is quite sufficient. The host or hostess should not insist upon\r\nguests' partaking of particular dishes, nor put anything upon their\r\nplates which they have declined.\r\n\r\nTHE TABLE.--None will deny that the appearance of the table affects\r\none's enjoyment of the food upon it. A well-appointed table with its\r\ncloth, though coarse in texture, perfectly clean and neatly laid, its\r\nglass and china bright and shining, and the silver showing by its\r\nglistening surface evidence of frequent polishings, gives far more\r\ncomfort and enjoyment than one where little attention is given to\r\nneatness, order, or taste. In many families, effort is made to secure\r\nall these important accessories when guests have been invited; but for\r\ncommon use, anything is considered \"good enough for just one's own\r\nfolks.\" This ought not to be, and mothers who permit such a course, need\r\nnot be surprised if their children exhibit a lack of self-respect and\r\ngenuineness as well as awkwardness and neglect of manners.\r\n\r\nThe table around which the family meals are taken, ought to be at all\r\ntimes the model of what it should be when surrounded by guests. As a\r\nwriter has well said, \"There is no silent educator in the household\r\nthat has higher rank than the table. Surrounded each day by the family\r\nwho are eager for refreshment of body and spirit, its impressions sink\r\ndeep; and its influences for good or ill form no mean part of the warp\r\nand woof of our lives. Its fresh damask, bright silver, glass, and\r\nchina, give beautiful lessons in neatness, order, and taste; its damask\r\nsoiled, rumpled, and torn, its silver dingy, its glass cloudy, and china\r\nnicked, annoy and vex us at first, and then instill their lessons of\r\ncarelessness and disorder. An attractive, well-ordered table is an\r\nincentive to good manners, and being a place where one is incited to\r\nlinger, it tends to control the bad habits of fast eating; while, on the\r\ncontrary, an uninviting, disorderly table gives license to bad manners,\r\nand encourages the haste which is proverbial among Americans. The woman,\r\nthen, who looks after her table in these particulars, is not doing\r\ntrivial work, for it rests with her to give silently these good or bad\r\nlessons in manners and morals to her household as they surround the\r\ndaily board.\"\r\n\r\nA well-appointed table requires very little time and labor. No pretense\r\nor ostentation is necessary; neatness and simplicity are far more\r\npleasing.\r\n\r\nSETTING THE TABLE.--Lay a piece of double-faced canton flannel\r\nunderneath the tablecloth. Even coarse napery will present a much better\r\nappearance with a sub-cover than if spread directly upon the table. It\r\nwill likewise lessen noise in changing courses and the likelihood of\r\ninjury to the table from hot dishes. Spread the tablecloth evenly,\r\nwithout wrinkles, and so that the center fold shall be exactly in the\r\nmiddle, parallel with the sides of the table. Mats, if used, should be\r\nplaced exactly straight and with regularity. If meat is served, spread a\r\nlarge napkin with points toward the center of the table at the carver's\r\nplace, to protect the tablecloth. Place the plates upon the table, right\r\nside up, at even distances from each other and straight with the cloth\r\nand the edge of the table. Lay the napkins directly in front or at the\r\nright of each plate. Place the fork at the left, the knife on the right\r\nwith the edge toward the plate, beyond this the soup spoon and two\r\nteaspoons, and at the front of these set the glass, cream glass, and\r\nindividual butter plate if these are used.\r\n\r\nA center piece consisting of a vase of freshly cut flowers, a pot of\r\nferns, a jar of small plants in bloom, a dish of well-polished red\r\napples, peaches, or other seasonable fruit, will add a touch of beauty\r\nand attractiveness. If the serving is to be done from the table by\r\nmembers of the family, place large spoons near dishes to be served, also\r\nthe proper number and kind of separate dishes for the purpose. If fruit\r\nis to be served, a finger bowl should be placed for each person. If the\r\nservice is by course, the extra dishes, knives, forks, and spoons\r\nneeded, also the finger bowls, water service, and cold foods in reserve\r\nfor a renewed supply or for other courses, should be made ready and\r\narranged upon the sideboard.\r\n\r\nThe soup ladle should be placed in front of the lady of the house, who\r\nalways serves the soup; and if meat is served, the carving knife and\r\nfork must, of course, be placed before the carver's place. The necessary\r\ndishes for each course should be brought on with the food, those for the\r\nfirst course being placed upon the table just a moment before dinner is\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of all dishes and foods upon the table should be\r\nuniform, regular, and tasteful, so as to give an orderly appearance to\r\nthe whole. The \"dishing up\" and arranging of the food are matters of no\r\nsmall importance, as a dull appetite will often be sharpened at the\r\nsight of a daintily arranged dish, while the keenest one may have its\r\nedge dulled by the appearance of a shapeless mass piled up with no\r\nregard to looks. Even the simplest food is capable of looking its best,\r\nand the greatest care should be taken to have all dishes served neatly\r\nand tastefully.\r\n\r\nThe table should not be set for breakfast the night before nor kept so\r\nfrom one meal to another, unless carefully covered with a cloth thick\r\nenough to prevent the dust from accumulating upon the dishes. The plates\r\nand glasses should then be placed bottom-side up and turned just before\r\nmealtime. No food of any kind should ever be allowed to remain uncovered\r\nupon the table from one meal to another. The cloth for covering the\r\ntable should be carefully shaken each time before using, and always used\r\nthe same side up until washed.\r\n\r\nPlates and individual meat dishes should be warmed, especially in\r\nwinter; but the greatest care should be taken that no dish becomes hot,\r\nas that not only makes it troublesome to handle, but is ruinous to the\r\ndishes.\r\n\r\nTHE SERVICE OF MEALS.--There are few invariable rules for either\r\ntable-setting or service. We will offer a few suggestions upon this\r\npoint, though doubtless other ways are equally good. A capital idea for\r\nthe ordinary home meal, when no servant is kept, especially if in the\r\nfamily there are older children, is to make different members of the\r\nfamily responsible for the proper service of some dish or course. The\r\nfruit, which should be the first course at breakfast, may be prepared\r\nand placed upon fruit plates with the proper utensils for\r\neating--napkins and finger bowls at each place before the meal is\r\nannounced. If apples or bananas are served, a cracker should be placed\r\nupon each plate to be eaten in connection with the fruit. Oranges and\r\ngrapes are, however, to be preferred when obtainable; the former may be\r\nprepared as directed on page 180. The hot foods may be dished, and the\r\ndishes placed on a side table in a _bain marie_, the hot water in which\r\nshould be as deep as the food within the dishes. The foods will thus be\r\nin readiness, and will keep much better than if placed upon the table at\r\nthe beginning of the meal. When the fruit is eaten, some member of the\r\nfamily may remove the fruit plates, and bring the hot grains, toasts,\r\nand other foods, placing them, together with the necessary individual\r\ndishes, before those who have their serving in charge. One member may be\r\nselected to pass the bread, another to dish the sauce, etc.; and thus\r\neach child, whether boy or girl--even those quite young--may contribute\r\nto the service, and none be overburdened, while at the same time it will\r\nbe a means of teaching a due regard for the comfort and enjoyment of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIf the meal is dinner, usually consisting of three courses, after the\r\nsoup has been eaten, it may be the duty of some member of the family to\r\nremove the soup plates and place the vegetables, grains, and meats if\r\nany are to served, before those chosen to serve them. At the close of\r\nthis course, another may remove the dishes and food, crumb the cloth,\r\nand place the dessert, with the proper dishes for serving, before the\r\nlady of the house or her oldest daughter, one of whom usually serves it.\r\n\r\nIf a servant is employed, the following is an excellent plan of service:\r\nThe soup plates or bowls should be placed hot upon the table, with the\r\ntureen of soup before the lady of the house, and the glasses filled\r\nbefore the dinner is announced.\r\n\r\nGrace having been said, the servant removes the cover of the soup\r\ntureen, and standing at the left of the lady, takes up with her left\r\nhand a soup plate, which she changes to the palm of her right hand and\r\nholds at the edge of the soup tureen until the lady has filled it, then\r\ncarries it, still holding it upon the palm of the hand, and places it\r\nbefore the head of the table. In the same manner all are served to soup.\r\nIf bowls instead of plates are used, a small silver or lacquered tray\r\nmay be used on which to carry the bowl. While the soup is being eaten,\r\nthe servant goes to the kitchen and brings in the hot dishes and foods\r\nfor the next course, and places them upon the side table. When the soup\r\nhas been finished, beginning with the one who sits at the head of the\r\ntable, the servant places before each person in turn a hot dinner plate,\r\nat the same time removing his soup plate to the sideboard or pantry.\r\nAfter changing all the plates, she removes the soup tureen, and if meat\r\nis to be served, places that before the carver with the individual\r\nplates, which, when he has placed a portion thereon, she serves to each\r\nin turn; then she takes the potato and other vegetables upon her tray,\r\nand serves them, going to the left of each person when passing them a\r\ndish, but placing individual dishes at the right; next she passes the\r\nbread, refills the glasses, taking each one separately to the sideboard,\r\nand then serves the grains.\r\n\r\nWhen every one has finished the course, she begins the clearing of the\r\ntable by first removing all large dishes of food; after that the plates\r\nand all soiled dishes, mats, and all table furniture except the glasses,\r\nnapkin rings, and center-pieces. Lastly she removes all crumbs with a\r\nbrush or napkin. When done, she places in front of each person a plate\r\nwith a doily and finger bowl upon it, and then brings the dessert and\r\ndessert dishes, placing them before the lady of the house, and passes\r\nthese for her as in the other courses. If the dessert is pudding, a\r\nspoon or fork should be placed on the plate at one side of the finger\r\nbowl. If the dessert is fruit, a fruit napkin may be used in place of\r\nthe doily, the real purpose of which is to prevent the bowl from sliding\r\nabout the plate in moving it. A fork and silver knife, or knife and\r\nspoon as the fruit may require, should be served with it.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SUGGESTIONS FOR WAITERS.--In serving a dish from which\r\npeople are expected to help themselves, always go to the left side.\r\n\r\nSoup, food in individual dishes, clean plates, and finger bowls should\r\nbe set down before people at their right hand.\r\n\r\nWhen removing soiled dishes after a course, always exchange them for\r\nclean ones, remembering that the only time when it is allowable to leave\r\nthe table without plates is when it is being cleared for the dessert.\r\n\r\nIn serving grains either dish them in small dishes before serving or\r\npass clean saucers at the same time for each to help himself, and in all\r\ncases see that each person is served to cream, sugar, and a teaspoon,\r\nwith grains.\r\n\r\nPass the bread two or three times during each meal, and keep careful\r\nwatch that all are well supplied.\r\n\r\nPour hot milk and all beverages on the side table; fill only three\r\nfourths full, and serve the same as anything else in individual dishes,\r\nplacing the glass at each person's right hand.\r\n\r\nWaiters should be noiseless and prompt, and neatly attired in dress\r\nsuitable to their occupation.\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS CONCERNING DINNER PARTIES.--Much of the success of a\r\ndinner party depends upon the guests selected; and the first point for\r\nconsideration by the lady who decides upon entertaining her friends\r\nthus, should be the congeniality of those whom she desires to invite,\r\nremembering that after the first greetings the guests see very little of\r\ntheir hostess, and consequently their enjoyment must largely depend upon\r\neach other. It is customary to issue invitations in the name of the host\r\nand hostess, from five to ten days in advance of the occasion. Printed\r\nor written invitations may be used. The following is a proper form:--\r\n\r\n         _Mr. and Mrs. George Brown_\r\n          _request the pleasure_\r\n                  _of_\r\n    _Mr. and Mrs. Henry Clark's company_\r\n               _at dinner_\r\n       _December 5th, at four o'clock._\r\n           _24 Maple Avenue._\r\n\r\nIf the dinner is given in especial honor to some stranger, a second card\r\nis inclosed on which is written:--\r\n\r\n    _To meet_\r\n\r\n          _Mrs. Harold Brooks of Philadelphia._\r\n\r\nInvitations to a dinner should be promptly accepted or declined, and if\r\naccepted, the engagement should on no account be lightly broken.\r\n\r\nUnless one has a large establishment, and is very sure of good service,\r\nthe bill of fare selected should not be an elaborate one, and the choice\r\nof dishes should be confined to those which one is used to preparing,\r\nand which in cost will not exceed one's means. It is the quality of the\r\ndinner which pleases, and not the multiplicity of dishes. Small dinners\r\nfor not less than six or more than ten guests are always the most\r\npleasant, and for those of moderate means or those unaccustomed to\r\ndinner-giving are by far the most suitable.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement and adornment of the table afford an opportunity for the\r\ndisplay of much artistic taste and skill. An expensive outlay is by no\r\nmeans necessary, as highly pleasing effects may be produced by the\r\naddition of a few choice, well-arranged flowers or blossoming plants to\r\na table already well laid with spotless linen, bright silver, and clean\r\nglass and china ware. A profusion of ornament should be avoided, large\r\npieces of plate, and high, elaborate designs of flowers or fruit should\r\nnot be used, as they obstruct the intercourse of the guests.\r\n\r\nA center piece of flowers, with a small bouquet tied with ribbon for\r\neach guest, is quite sufficient. Low dishes filled with violets or\r\npansies; a basket filled with oranges, mingled with orange leaves and\r\nblossoms; bowls of ferns and roses; a block of ice wreathed in ferns,\r\nwith an outer circle of water lilies; dishes of vari-colored grapes\r\nresting amid the bright leaves of the foliage plant, are some of many\r\npleasing designs which may be employed for the adornment of the dinner\r\ntable. The amount of space occupied with decorations must depend upon\r\nthe style of service employed. If no calculation need be made for\r\nplacing the different dishes composing the dinner, a strip of colored\r\nplush or satin bordered with ivy, smilax, or some trailing vine, is\r\nquite frequently used for the decoration of a long table.\r\n\r\nA very pleasing custom consists in selecting some especial color for the\r\ndecorations with which the table napery, dishes, and even the food to be\r\nserved shall accord; as, for example, a \"pink\" dinner, with roses as the\r\nchief flower, strawberries, pink lemonade, and other pink attractions;\r\nor a \"yellow\" luncheon, served on napery etched with yellow, with vases\r\nof goldenrod for center pieces, and dainty bouquets of the same tied\r\nwith yellow ribbon at each plate, while yellow tapers in golden\r\ncandlesticks cast a mellow light over all, during the serving of a bill\r\nof fare which might include peaches and cream, oranges, pumpkin pie, and\r\nother yellow comestibles.\r\n\r\nThe menu cards afford much opportunity for adding attractiveness to a\r\ncompany dinner. If one possesses artistic skill, a floral decoration or\r\na tiny sketch, with an appropriate quotation, the guest's name, and date\r\nof the dinner, make of the cards very pleasing souvenirs. A proper\r\nquotation put after each dish is much in vogue as a means of promoting\r\nconversation. The quotations are best selected from one author.\r\n\r\nThere are no absolute rules for the service of company dinners, much\r\ndepending upon social conditions and established customs. Two modes are\r\nin general use,--placing the dishes upon the table to be dished by the\r\nhost and hostess, and placing all food upon the side table to be dished\r\nand served by a waiter. When the latter method is used, it is quite\r\ncustomary to place the plates of soup upon the table before dinner is\r\nannounced. As many knives, forks, and spoons as will be needed for the\r\ncourses may be placed beside each plate, or they may be brought in with\r\nthe course, as preferred. Clean plates are necessary for every course.\r\nThe manner of serving is essentially like that already described.\r\n\r\nCare should be taken to have the dining room at an agreeable\r\ntemperature, neither too warm nor too cold.\r\n\r\nAt large dinner parties, each gentleman, as he enters, receives a card\r\nupon which is written the name of the lady he is to take in to dinner,\r\nto whom the hostess at once presents him. When dinner is announced, the\r\nhost leads the way with the oldest or most distinguished lady or the one\r\nto whom the dinner is given, while the hostess follows last, with the\r\nmost honored gentleman. The host places the lady whom he escorts on his\r\nright. If the number is small, the host indicates the places the guests\r\nshould occupy as they enter the room; if the party is large, the menu\r\ncard at each plate bears the name of the guest for whom it is designed.\r\nThe lady escorted by the host should be the first one served.\r\n\r\nSoup is always taken and tasted, whether liked or not; after the first\r\ncourse, it is proper to accept or refuse a dish, as preferred.\r\n\r\nNo well-bred hostess ever apologizes for the food upon her table or\r\nurges anything upon her guests when once declined. No orders should be\r\ngiven to servants during the meal; everything that will contribute to\r\nthe proper serving of the dinner should be arranged beforehand, and all\r\nnecessary instructions given.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the dinner, the hostess gives the sign for retiring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE TOPICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     A meal--what is it? Just enough of food\r\n     To renovate and well refresh the frame,\r\n     So that with spirits lightened, and with strength renewed,\r\n     We turn with willingness to work again.\r\n\r\n    --_Sel._\r\n\r\n    Do not bring disagreeable things to the table in your conversation\r\n    any more than you would in your dishes.--_Sel._\r\n\r\n    Courtesy in the mistress of the house consists in feeding\r\n    conversation; never in usurping it.--_Mme. Swetchine_\r\n\r\n    Good humor and good health follow a good meal; and by a good meal we\r\n    mean anything, however simple, well dressed in its way.--_Smiles._\r\n\r\n    Unquiet meals make ill digestion.--_Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n    Eat slowly and do not season your food with care.--_Sel._\r\n\r\n    To rise from the table _able_ to eat a little more is a proverbially\r\n    good rule for every one. There is nothing more idiotic than forcing\r\n    down a few mouthfuls, because they happen to remain on one's plate\r\n    after hunger is satisfied, and because they may be \"wasted\" if left.\r\n    It is the most serious waste to overtax the stomach with even half\r\n    an ounce more than it can take care of.--_Sel._\r\n\r\n    I pray you, O excellent wife! cumber not yourself and me to get a\r\n    curiously rich dinner for this man and woman who have just alighted\r\n    at our gate.... These things, if they are desirous of them, they can\r\n    get for a few shillings at any village inn; but rather let that\r\n    stranger see, if he will, in your looks, accents, and behavior, your\r\n    heart and earnestness, your thought and will, that which he cannot\r\n    buy at any price in any city, and which he may travel miles and dine\r\n    sparely and sleep hardly to behold.--_Emerson._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER MEAL TIME\r\n\r\nTo no other department of domestic work perhaps is so little thought\r\ngiven or so little science applied as to the routine work of clearing\r\nthe table and washing the dishes after mealtime. Any way to accomplish\r\nthe object, seems to be the motto in very many households. But even for\r\nthese prosaic tasks there is a best way, which, if employed, may make of\r\nan otherwise irksome service a really pleasurable one.\r\n\r\nCLEARING THE TABLE.--First of all, put back the chairs, and brush\r\nup the crumbs from the floor, then collect all untouched foods and store\r\nthem away in clean dishes; next gather the silver, place it handles\r\nupward in pitchers or other deep dishes, and pour hot water over it. For\r\ngathering the silver a compartment tray in which knives, forks, and\r\nspoons may be placed separately is important. Many of the scratches and\r\nmarks on their silver ware, which housekeepers deplore, come from the\r\ncareless handling together of forks, knives, and spoons. Now in a deep\r\nbasin upon a tray, collect all the refuse and partly eaten foods,\r\ncarefully emptying cups, glasses, finger bowls, etc., and scraping all\r\ndishes which contained food as clean as possible; for no crumbs or\r\nparticles of food should be introduced into the dishwater. Pile the\r\ndishes as fast as cleaned upon a second tray in readiness for washing.\r\nIt saves much liability of breakage in transferring from the dining room\r\nto the kitchen, if each kind of soiled dishes is packed by itself.\r\n\r\nWipe carefully, if not needing to be washed, and replenish all salts,\r\ngranola cups, and sugar bowls before putting away. Gather the soiled\r\nnapkins for the laundry, and put those clean enough to be used again in\r\ntheir proper places. Especial care must be taken, however, so to\r\ndesignate those reserved for future use that each shall receive the same\r\nagain, as nothing is more disgusting to a sensitive person than to be\r\ntendered a napkin which has been used by some one else. Some form of\r\nnapkin holder should be considered an essential part of the table\r\nfurnishing. If rings cannot be afforded, ordinary clothes pins, gilded\r\nand decorated with a bit of ribbon, make very pretty substitutes.\r\n\r\nBrush the tablecloth, fold in its creases, also the sub-cover of canton\r\nflannel, and lay both away until again needed.\r\n\r\n_Washing the Dishes._--Plenty of hot water and clean towels are the\r\nessential requisites for expeditious and thorough dish-washing. A few\r\ndrops of crude ammonia added to the water will soften it and add to the\r\nluster of the silver and china. Soap may be used or not according to\r\ncircumstances; all greasy dishes require a good strong suds. There\r\nshould also be provided two dish drainers or trays, unless there is a\r\nstationary sink with tray on which to drain the dishes. For washing\r\nglassware and fine china, _papier-maché_ tubs are preferable to anything\r\nelse, as they are less liable to occasion breakage of the ware. If many\r\ndishes are to be washed, frequent changes of water will be necessary as\r\nthe first becomes either cold or dirty. Perfectly sweet, clean dishes\r\nare not evolved from dirty dishwater. The usual order given for the\r\nwashing of dishes is, glasses, silver, fine china, cups, saucers,\r\npitchers, plates and other dishes. This is, however, based upon the\r\nsupposition that cups and saucers are used for beverages, and plates are\r\nsoiled by the use of various greasy foods; but in families where tea\r\nand coffee and animal foods are dispensed with, and saucers are used for\r\ngrains with cream dressing, the plates are often cleaner than the\r\nsaucers and should be washed first.\r\n\r\nThe general rule to be followed is always to wash the dishes least\r\nsoiled first, and all of one kind together. The latter item is specially\r\nimportant, since much of the nicking of dishes and breaking of handles\r\nfrom cups, covers, and pitchers is the result of piling dishes\r\npromiscuously together while washing.\r\n\r\nIt is quite as easy to finish washing one kind before beginning on\r\nanother as to do it in any less safe and systematic way, and if wiped in\r\nthe same order, it does away with the need of sorting when putting the\r\ndishes away.\r\n\r\nIf for any reason the dishes must wait for a time before being washed,\r\nthe best plan is to pack them carefully into large pans, cover with warm\r\nwater, and let them soak. When ready to wash them, prepare hot suds and\r\nclear water for rinsing in additional pans. Do not use too hot water, as\r\na high temperature will break glass and \"check\" the enamel of ordinary\r\nware. The law of expansion holds good with both china and glassware, and\r\nall glass and glazed wares should be dipped into hot water in such a\r\nmanner that all its surfaces may receive the heat and expand together.\r\n\r\nAll dishes used for milk should be first thoroughly rinsed in cold water\r\nbefore being washed in hot water or suds.\r\n\r\nBe sure that the inside of all cups and pitchers is thoroughly clean. It\r\nis a good plan to have a mop made by fastening finger-lengths of coarse\r\ncotton twin to a suitable handle, for washing the inside of pitchers.\r\n\r\nIn cleaning forks, spoons, or cups, which have been employed in beating\r\nor eating eggs, rinse them in cold water before putting them into hot\r\nsuds, as hot water cooks the egg and causes it to adhere. Common table\r\nsalt is said to be excellent for removing the egg tarnish from silver.\r\nClean Dover egg beaters by beating a dish of cold water, or by holding\r\nunder a stream of cold water from the faucet, then carefully rinse and\r\nwipe perfectly dry. Do not put the upper part of the beater into hot\r\nwater, as it will remove the oil from the wheels so that they will not\r\nwork easily.\r\n\r\nGrain-boilers and mush-kettles should be allowed to cool, then filled\r\nwith cold water and allowed to soak during the meal hour, when they can\r\nbe easily cleaned.\r\n\r\nTin dishes should be washed with hot suds as soon as possible after\r\nusing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wire Dishcloth]\r\n\r\nFor cleaning; iron pots, use soft water and soap or washing-soda with a\r\nwire dishcloth or kettle scraper. If the food adheres to the sides, fill\r\nwith cold water and soak. Kettles and all dishes placed over a fire\r\nshould be cleaned on the outside as well as the inside. To remove the\r\nsoot, rub first with pieces of dry paper and afterward with damp paper;\r\nthen wash with hot suds and a cloth. Kettles and saucepans burned on the\r\ninside may he cleaned by putting a little cold water and ashes in them\r\nand allowing them to soak on the range until the water is warm.\r\nPorcelain-lined and granite-ware utensils stained from food burning on,\r\nmay be cleaned after soaking for a time in a solution of sal-soda, which\r\nmay be prepared by pouring boiling water over the soda in the proportion\r\nof two pints of water to one pound of sal-soda, and stirring until\r\ndissolved. It may be prepared in quantity and stored in a stone jar\r\nuntil needed.\r\n\r\nWash wooden ware and bread boards with cold water and sand soap. In\r\nscraping dough from the bread board, always scrape with the grain of the\r\nwood and be careful not to roughen the surface.\r\n\r\nSteel knives and forks with ivory or wooden handles should not be put\r\ninto dishwater. Hot water will expand the steel and cause the handles to\r\ncrack. Wash them thoroughly with the dishcloth, scour with bath brick,\r\nand wipe dry.\r\n\r\nAll tin and iron dishes should be thoroughly dried before putting away,\r\nto prevent rusting.\r\n\r\nIf draining is considered preferable to wiping dishes, a good plan, if\r\none has not a patent dish drainer, is to fold an old tablecloth in\r\nseveral thicknesses and spread upon the table. Wash the dishes carefully\r\nand rinse in hot water. Place a cup or bowl bottom upward, lay a plate\r\non each side, then one between and above them, with two more on the\r\noutside, and so on, not permitting them to touch more than necessary.\r\n\r\nDISHCLOTHS AND TOWELS.--No dishes or utensils can be well cared for\r\nwithout good, clean dishcloths and towels, and plenty of them. An\r\nexcellent dishcloth may be either knit or crocheted in some solid stitch\r\nof coarse cotton yarn. Ten or twelve inches square is a good size.\r\nSeveral thicknesses of cheese-cloth basted together make good\r\ndishcloths, as do also pieces of old knitted garments and Turkish\r\ntoweling. If a dish mop is preferred, it may be made as follows: Cut a\r\ngroove an inch from the end of a stick about a foot in length and of\r\nsuitable shape for a handle; cut a ball of coarse twine, into nine-inch\r\nlengths, and lay around the stick with the middle of the strands against\r\nthe groove; wind a fine wire or cord around the twine to fasten it in\r\nthe groove; then shake down the twine, so it will lie all one way like a\r\nmop, and fasten it to the handle by tying a second cord around it on the\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nTowels for drying dishes should be of three different grades,--fine ones\r\nwithout lint for glass, silver, and fine china; coarser ones for the\r\nordinary table ware, and still another quality for pans, kettles, and\r\nother kitchen ware. The right size is a yard in length and half as wide,\r\nwith the ends hemmed. As to material, fine checked linen is usually\r\nemployed for glass and silver towels, and crash for ordinary dishes, for\r\niron and tinware towels which have become somewhat worn, or a coarse bag\r\nopened and hemmed, may be used. Old, half-worn tablecloths may be cut\r\ninto excellent dish towels.\r\n\r\nIt is of the greatest importance that all dishcloths, mops, and towels\r\nbe kept perfectly sweet and clean. Greasy dishcloths and sour towels are\r\nneither neat nor wholesome and are a most fertile source of germs, often\r\nbreeding disease and death. After each dish washing, the dishcloth,\r\ntowels, and mops should be thoroughly washed in hot water with plenty of\r\nsoap, well rinsed and hung up to dry either upon a line out of doors or\r\na rack made for the purpose near the kitchen range. If care is always\r\ntaken to clean the dishes as much as possible before washing and to\r\nchange the suds as often as they become dirty, the towels will not be\r\nhard to keep clean and sweet-smelling. Those used during the week should\r\ngo into the wash as regularly as other household articles. Dish towels\r\nare also much better for being ironed. It gives them a \"surface\" which\r\nfacilitates the drying operation.\r\n\r\nTHE CARE OF SILVER, GLASS, ETC.--If silver is well washed in hot\r\nwater containing a few drops of ammonia, and carefully dried with a\r\nfine, soft towel, it will keep bright for a long time without other\r\ncleaning. If special cleaning is necessary, try the following: Place the\r\nsilver in a pan of hot water, then with a soft cloth, soaped and\r\nsprinkled with powdered borax, scour the silver well; afterward rinse in\r\nclear cold water, and dry with a clean cloth. If a more thorough\r\ncleaning is needed, apply moistened Spanish whiting with a silver brush\r\nand soft flannel, afterward polishing with dry whiting and chamois skin.\r\nFrequent scouring should be avoided by careful washing, as too much\r\nrubbing wears out plated ware and dulls the best of silver. Silver ware\r\nand plate which is not in ordinary use can be kept from tarnishing by\r\nvarnishing with collodion, a solution of gun-cotton in ether. The\r\narticles should be carefully brushed in this colorless varnish with an\r\nelastic brush, taking care that the entire surface is covered. The film\r\nof collodion will protect the underlying metal from the action of the\r\nsulphurous vapors to which is due the blackening of silver.\r\n\r\nTinware which has become blackened may be made to look bright and\r\nshining again by rubbing with a damp cloth dipped in sal-soda. Afterward\r\nwipe dry. Sand soap or sapolio may be used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nCut-glass ware which has become in any way blurred or tarnished can be\r\nrestored by polishing it with a soft piece of newspaper. First rub well\r\nwith a piece slightly moistened and afterward repeat the process with\r\ndry paper. Rubbing with a soft brush dipped in fine, soft whiting is\r\nanother method often employed for the same purpose. Cut-glass\r\nwater-bottles dim or stained on the inside are best cleaned by rinsing\r\nwith dilute muriatic acid, then carefully rinsing several times in clear\r\ncold water to remove all trace of the acid, which is a poison.\r\n\r\nAll fine china should be handled carefully in washing and drying. There\r\nwill be less danger of breakage if the china is gradually heated by\r\nallowing it to stand in a pan of warm water before being put into hot\r\nwater. The same is true of all table ware, and is of especial importance\r\nin cold weather.\r\n\r\nBrass faucets and other brass or copper articles may be cleaned by\r\nrubbing with whiting wet with aqua ammonia.\r\n\r\nYellowed ivory handles may be restored to their original whiteness by\r\nrubbing with sandpaper and emery; mineral soap or pumice stone may be\r\nused for the same purpose. Nice table cutlery packed away for a season\r\nmay be kept from rusting by covering the metal portion with a thin\r\ncoating of paraffine. Rust may be removed from steel by scouring with\r\nemery and oil; but if there is much corrosion, some weak muriatic acid\r\nwill be needed. This, however, will take some of the metal with the\r\nrust, and must be washed off quickly.\r\n\r\nTrays and japanned goods should never have boiling water poured over\r\nthem, as it will make the varnish crack and peel. If a tray is badly\r\nsoiled, wet with a sponge moistened in warm water and soap, and rub with\r\na dry cloth; if it looks smeary, dust on a little flour and rub again.\r\nMarks and scratches may sometimes be removed by rubbing with a flannel\r\ncloth dipped in sweet oil.\r\n\r\nCARE OF THE TABLE LINEN.--Much of the attractiveness of the table\r\ndepends upon the linen used; if this is not well cared for, the finest\r\ntable ware cannot make up for the defect.\r\n\r\nStains upon table linen made by acids and vinegar may be removed by\r\nsimply washing in clear water; berry stains are easily taken out by\r\npouring boiling water over them; peach stains are best removed by\r\nsoaking for some time in cold water and then washing with soap before\r\nallowing warm water to touch them. Chlorine water or a solution of\r\nchloride of lime will remove fruit stains, and vegetable colors. Coffee\r\nstains rubbed with a mixture of warm water and the yolk of egg, are said\r\nto disappear when the mixture is washed off with clean warm water. Sour\r\nbuttermilk well rubbed into the material, dried in, and afterward washed\r\nout in several waters, is said to be effectual in removing tea stains.\r\nAll stains should be removed as soon as possible after being made, and\r\nalways before putting the linen into the wash.\r\n\r\nIn washing table linen, housekeepers should remember that hard rubbing\r\nis the worst wear which it can receive. If soaked over night, a gentle\r\nsqueezing will usually be quite sufficient to remove all soil, or if a\r\nlittle borax (a handful to ten gallons of water) or household ammonia in\r\nthe proportion of two tablespoonfuls to a pail of water be added, two or\r\nthree hours' soaking will suffice. Care should also be taken in hanging\r\nand fastening properly upon the line. Fold the cloth over the line six\r\nor eight inches at least, and in such a manner as to keep the thread\r\nstraight, and fasten with three or more clothes pins. Table linen is\r\noften sadly frayed at the corners by being pinned so that all strain\r\ncomes upon the corners, and if left to whip in the wind, is soon ruined.\r\nNapkins in summer are much nicer if dried upon the grass. Only the\r\nmerest trifle of starch, if any, should be used for table linen.\r\n\r\nTable linen should be taken from the line while still damp, folded\r\nevenly lengthwise with the selvage together, then folded lengthwise\r\nagain, rolled tight, and wrapped in damp towels so that the outside will\r\nnot become dry, and ironed the same day. The irons should be heavy and\r\nas hot as possible without danger of scorching, and the board should be\r\nwell padded with several thicknesses of flannel. Iron the linen in\r\nsingle folds, keeping a damp cloth over portions which will not be\r\nimmediately reached. When the entire surface has been ironed, fold\r\nevenly lengthwise and with the selvage edges toward the ironer, again go\r\nover the entire upper side; then fold with the just completed portion\r\ninside, iron again, and so continue until the whole is ironed and\r\nfolded. Both napkins and tablecloths are ironed in this way. They\r\nshould be thoroughly dried with the iron and well aired before being\r\nlaid away, in order to bring out the patterns well and to give them the\r\ndesirable glossy finish.\r\n\r\nColored table linen should be washed in tepid water containing a little\r\npowdered borax, which serves to set the color. Very little, if any, soap\r\nshould be used. Rinse in tepid water containing a small quantity of\r\nboiled starch; dry in the shade, and iron while yet damp.\r\n\r\nTable linen should be carefully darned at once when it begins to wear\r\nand become thin, and may thus be preserved for a long time. When new, it\r\nshould be washed before being made up, and the threads raveled or drawn,\r\nso as to make the ends exactly straight. Napkins should be washed before\r\nbeing cut apart. When not required for regular use, the linen should be\r\nfolded loosely, and laid away without ironing in some place where it\r\nwill not be subjected to pressure. When needed, it can be quickly\r\ndampened and ironed.\r\n\r\nTHE GARBAGE.--What to do with the waste accumulating from\r\npreparation of foods is a question of no small importance. The too\r\nfrequent disposition of such material is to dump it into a waste-barrel\r\nor garbage box near the back door, to await the rounds of the scavenger.\r\nUnless more than ordinary precautions in regard to cleanliness are\r\nobserved, such a proceeding is fraught with great danger. The bits of\r\nmoist food, scraps of meat, vegetables, and other refuse, very quickly\r\nset up a fermentative process, which, under the sun's rays, soon breeds\r\nmiasm and germs; especially is this true if the receptacle into which\r\nthe garbage is thrown is not carefully cleaned after each emptying.\r\n\r\nA foul-smelling waste-barrel ought never to be permitted under any\r\ncircumstances. The best plan is to burn all leavings and table refuse as\r\nfast as made, which may be done without smell or smoke by opening all\r\nthe back drafts of the kitchen range, and placing them on the hot coals\r\nto dry and burn. Some housekeepers keep in one end of the sink a wire\r\ndish drainer into which all fruit and vegetable parings are put. If\r\nwet, the water quickly drains from them, and they are ready to be put\r\ninto the stove, where a very little fire soon reduces them to ashes. All\r\nwaste products which cannot well be burned, may be buried at a distance\r\nfrom the house, but not too much in one spot, and the earth should be\r\ncarefully covered over afterward. Under no circumstances should it be\r\nscattered about on the surface of the ground near the back door, as\r\nheedless people are apt to do.\r\n\r\nIf the table refuse must be saved and fed to animals, it should be\r\ncarefully sorted, kept free from all dishwater, sour milk, etc., and\r\nused as promptly as possible. It is a good plan to have two tightly\r\ncovered waste pails of heavy tin to be used on alternate days. When one\r\nis emptied, it may be thoroughly cleansed and left to purify in the air\r\nand sunshine while the other is in use. Any receptacle for waste should\r\nbe entirely emptied and thoroughly disinfected each day with boiling\r\nsuds and an old broom. This is especially imperative if the refuse is to\r\nbe used as food for cows, since the quality of the milk is more or less\r\naffected by that of the food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE TOPICS.\r\n\r\n    A woman cannot work at dressmaking, tailoring, or any other\r\n    sedentary employment, ten hours a day, year in and out, without\r\n    enfeebling her constitution, impairing her eyesight, and bringing on\r\n    a complication of complaints; but she can sweep, cook, wash, and do\r\n    the duties of a well-ordered house, with modern arrangements, and\r\n    grow healthier every year. The times in New England when all women\r\n    did housework a part of every day, were the times when all women\r\n    were healthy.--_Harriet Beecher Stowe._\r\n\r\n\r\n    The best ways are commonly the easiest ways and those that give most\r\n    comfort to the household. _Know how_ is a great labor-saving\r\n    invention, on which there is no patent.--_Sel._\r\n\r\n     Who sweeps a room as for God's law\r\n     Makes that and th' action fine.\r\n\r\n    --_George Herbert._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA YEAR'S BREAKFASTS & DINNERS\r\n\r\nWhat to get for the family meals is frequently a most perplexing\r\nproblem, especially when one remembers the many important points that\r\nshould enter into the arrangement of the daily bill of fare. A\r\nwell-arranged menu should be composed of articles which supply the\r\nrequisite amount of food elements for proper nutrition, palatably\r\nprepared. These should be adapted to the season and also to the family\r\npurse. There should be an agreeable and pleasing change from day to day,\r\nwith never too great variety at one meal, and no incongruous association\r\nof foods that do not harmonize, upon the same bill of fare. The amount\r\nof time and strength available for the preparation of the meal must also\r\nreceive consideration. The problem would be easier of solution could one\r\nselect her menu wholly from fresh material each time; but in most\r\nhouseholds the odds and ends and \"left-over\" foods must be utilized, and\r\nif possible compounded into dishes that will not have the savor of\r\nyesterday's breakfast or dinner.\r\n\r\nThe making of a bill of fare offers opportunity for thought and study\r\nunder all circumstances; but it is often particularly difficult for the\r\nhousewife long accustomed to the use of foods of a different character,\r\nto make up a menu of hygienic dishes properly adapted to all\r\nrequirements. For such of our readers as need aid in this direction, we\r\ngive in this chapter bills of fare for fifty-two weeks' breakfasts and\r\ndinners. Not that we presume to have arranged a model dietary which\r\nevery one can adopt,--individual preferences, resources, and various\r\nother conditions would preclude that,--but we have endeavored to prepare\r\na list of menus suitable for use should circumstances admit, and which\r\nwe trust may be found helpfully suggestive of good, hygienic living.\r\n\r\nWe have given meats no place upon these bills of fare, as we wished\r\nparticularly to illustrate how good, substantial menus of appetizing\r\nvariety can be provided without their use; but such of our readers as\r\ndesire this class of foods will have no difficulty in supplementing the\r\nbills we have arranged by adding such meats as accord with their tastes\r\nand purses, while our chapter on Meats will give them all needed\r\ninformation as to their preparation.\r\n\r\nIn arranging the bills of fare it has been presupposed that the\r\nhousewife has provided herself with at least a moderate allowance of\r\ncanned or dried vegetables and fruits during their season, for use\r\nthroughout the year. Effort has also been made to suggest an ample\r\nvariety of seasonable and wholesome articles and to make provision for\r\nany probable left-over foods; and to illustrate how by planning and\r\nthinking beforehand the same material may be used to form the base of\r\ntwo different dishes for successive days, enough of which for both may\r\noften be cooked at the same time, thus economizing in time and fuel.\r\n\r\nNo particular year has been taken, as we desired the menus to be adapted\r\nto all years, and as no dates could be given, we have taken even weeks,\r\nending each with a Sabbath menu, beginning with the first month of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nA third meal, if desired, whether it be luncheon or supper, should, for\r\nhealth's sake, be so simple in character that we have not deemed it\r\nnecessary to give bills of fare. Breads, fruits, and grains, with milk,\r\ncream, and some simple relish, tastefully served, offer ample provision\r\nfor a healthful and nourishing repast.\r\n\r\nNo mention has been made of beverages upon the bills of fare. If any are\r\nused, hot milk or caramel coffee are to be preferred. Cooked fruit,\r\neither fresh, dried, or canned, is desirable for every meal, but the\r\nkind--as also of the fresh fruit upon the breakfast bill--may be\r\narranged according to individual preferences and resources. The use of\r\ncream, sugar, and other accessories should be suited to circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is intended that croutons be served with the soups, and in arranging\r\nthe variety of breads, an effort has been made to provide one of harder\r\ntexture for use with grains and other soft foods. The wafers mentioned\r\nare the whole-wheat and gluten wafers manufactured by the Sanitarium\r\nFood Co., which by many families are considered more convenient for\r\ngeneral use as a hard bread than the crisps, sticks, etc., which upon\r\nsome of the menus are designed for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nLess variety may be used, and changes made to suit the taste and\r\ncircumstances of those providing and partaking of the meals; but\r\nwhatever is subtracted should still leave upon the bill of fare the more\r\nnutritious articles, like grains, whole-wheat bread, and other foods\r\nrich in nerve and muscle forming elements.\r\n\r\nWhether the housewife follows the bills of fare given with such\r\nmodifications as are best suited to the needs of her household, or\r\nprovides some of her own choosing, she will find it a great saving of\r\nvexation and trouble to make them out for several days or a week ahead,\r\nat one time, rather than from day to day or from meal to meal. She can\r\nthen plan her work and her resources so as the more nearly to make \"both\r\nends meet,\" and can provide a more varied fare, while if changes are\r\nneeded, they can be easily made by substituting one article for another,\r\nas circumstances demand.\r\n\r\nIn the arrangement of her menus she will find it well to select first\r\nthe grain and breads to be used, since being among the most nutritious\r\nof all foods, they may well form the chief and staple food, around\r\nwhich all other articles upon the bill of fare are grouped. If the grain\r\nchosen be rice, farina, or one largely composed of starch, the remainder\r\nof the menu should include some foods rich in nitrogenous elements, such\r\nas macaroni, whole-wheat or Graham breads, the legumes, eggs, etc. If\r\nthe choice of grain be one containing a high percentage of nitrogenous\r\nmaterial, less of this element will be required in the accompanying\r\nfoods. As an aid in determining the nutritive value of any given food\r\nsubstance, the following table, presenting the results of the chemical\r\nanalysis of the more common articles used as food, which we have\r\ncompiled from the most recent scientific authorities, will be found\r\nhelpful:--\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE NUTRITIVE VALUES OF COMMON FOOD SUBSTANCES.\r\n\r\n    (1)Water.\r\n    (2)Albuminous elements.\r\n    (3)Starch.\r\n    (4)Grape Sugar.\r\n    (5)Cane Sugar.\r\n    (6)Free Fat.\r\n    (7)Free Acid.\r\n\r\n    GRAINS.\r\n    FOOD SUBSTANCES  (1)    (2)   (3)    (4)  (5)   (6)   (7)\r\n    Wheat, Poland   13.2   21.5      61.9      X    1.5    X\r\n     Mich.

To many such we trust that our \"year's\r\nbreakfasts and dinners\" may come like the grateful suggestions of a\r\nhelpful friend.

prices. The following analysis of several similar\r\nbills of fare used in widely different localities will serve to show\r\nsomething of the average cost. The first of these were taken at random\r\nfrom the daily menus, during the month of January, of a Michigan family\r\nof seventeen persons, grown persons and hearty, growing children, none\r\nyounger than six years. In the estimates made of the cost of material,\r\nwherever fractions occurred, the next higher whole number was taken. No\r\nbutter was used, a small pitcher of cream for each individual supplying\r\nits place. The milk used for cooking was not counted, since in this case\r\nmost of the cream had been removed, and its cost reckoned at the entire\r\ncost of the milk itself, or twenty cents a quart, allowing four quarts\r\nof milk at five cents a quart for one quart of cream.\r\n\r\n    BILLS OF FARE.\r\n\r\n    BREAKFAST\r\n\r\n    Fresh Apples\r\n    Toasted Whole-Wheat Wafers\r\n    Rolled Wheat with Cream\r\n    Grape Toast\r\n    Whole-Wheat Puffs\r\n    Toasted Wafers\r\n    Baked Sweet Apples\r\n    Stewed Prunes\r\n    Cream\r\n    Hot Milk\r\n\r\n    _Cost:_\r\n    Apples (fresh and baked), one half peck,   10c.;\r\n    one lb. rolled wheat,   5c.;\r\n    one and one half lbs. zwieback for toast,   15c.;\r\n    one pint of canned grape pulp for toast,   12c.;\r\n    puffs (for which beside milk, three eggs at 25c. per doz., and one and\r\n    one half lbs. whole-wheat flour at 5c. per lb. were used),   14c.;\r\n    two and one half lbs. of California prunes,   37c.;\r\n    two qts. cream, an amount quite sufficient for moistening\r\n    the toast and supplying a small cream cup for each individual,   40c.;\r\n    two lbs. of toasted whole-wheat wafers, 20c.\r\n\r\n    --making the entire cost of breakfast $1.53, or\r\n    exactly nine cents per person.\r\n\r\n\r\n    DINNER\r\n\r\n    Lima Bean Soup\r\n    Baked Potato with Cream Sauce\r\n    Scalloped Vegetable Oysters\r\n    Graham Grits\r\n    Whole-Wheat Bread\r\n    Whole-Wheat Wafers, Toasted\r\n    Canned Cherries\r\n    Citron Apples with Whipped Cream\r\n    Cream\r\n    Hot Milk\r\n\r\n    _Cost:_\r\n    One and one fourth lbs.

While we admire the beautiful custom of\r\ngathering one's friends and neighbors around the hospitable board, and\r\nby no means object to a special dinner on holiday occasions, yet we are\r\nno wise in sympathy with the indiscriminate feastings so universally\r\nindulged in at such dinners, whereby stomachs are overloaded with a\r\ndecidedly unhealthful quality of food, to be followed by dull brains and\r\naching heads for days to come.\r\n\r\nAnd this is not the extent of the evil. Holiday feasting undoubtedly has\r\nmuch to do with the excessive use of intoxicants noticeable at such\r\ntimes. Tempted to overeat by the rich and highly seasoned viands which\r\nmake up the bill of fare, the heaviness resulting from a stomach thus\r\noverburdened creates a thirst not readily satisfied. A person who has\r\nnoted how frequently one is called upon to assuage thirst after having\r\neaten too heartily of food on any occasion, will hardly doubt that\r\nindigestible holiday dinners are detrimental to the cause of total\r\nabstinence.\r\n\r\nThen, for the sake of health and the cause of temperance, while an ample\r\nrepast is provided, let not the bill of fare be so lavish as to tempt to\r\ngormandizing; and let the viands be of the most simple and wholesome\r\ncharacter practicable, although, of course, inviting. As an aid in this\r\ndirection, we offer the following bills of fare;--\r\n\r\n    THANKSGIVING MENUS.\r\n\r\n    NO. 1\r\n\r\n    Tomato Soap with Pasta d'Italia\r\n    Stuffed Potatoes\r\n    Canned Asparagus\r\n    Pulp Succotash\r\n    Celery\r\n    Graham Grits\r\n    Fruit Rolls\r\n    Graham Puffs\r\n    Buns\r\n    Canned Peaches\r\n    Pumpkin Pie\r\n    Baked Chestnuts\r\n    Grape Apples\r\n    Fresh Fruits\r\n\r\n    NO. 2\r\n\r\n    Vegetable Oyster Soup\r\n    Potato Puff\r\n    Roasted Sweet Potatoes\r\n    Parsnip Stewed with Celery\r\n    Beet Salad\r\n    Boiled Wheat with Raisins\r\n    Cream Crisps\r\n    Whole-Wheat Bread\r\n    Crescents with Peach Jelly\r\n    Canned Fruit\r\n    Cranberry Tarts\r\n    Almonds and Pecans\r\n\r\n\r\n    HOLIDAY MENUS.\r\n\r\n    NO. 1\r\n\r\n    Canned Corn Soup\r\n    Mashed Sweet Potato\r\n    Macaroni with Tomato Sauce\r\n    Canned Wax Beans or Cabbage Salad\r\n    Steamed Rice\r\n    Graham Puffs\r\n    Fruit Bread\r\n    Toasted Wafers\r\n    Canned Strawberries\r\n    Malaga Grapes\r\n    Loaf Cake with Roasted Almonds\r\n    Bananas in Syrup\r\n\r\n    NO. 2\r\n\r\n    Pea and Tomato Soup\r\n    Ornamental Potatoes\r\n    Scalloped Vegetable Oysters\r\n    Egg and Macaroni\r\n    Farina with Fig Sauce\r\n    Sally Lunn Gems\r\n    Beaten Biscuit\r\n    Graham Bread\r\n    Apply Jelly\r\n    Canned Gooseberries\r\n    Prune Pie with Granola Crust\r\n    Citron Apples\r\n    Pop Corn\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Picnic Dinner]\r\n\r\n\r\nPICNIC DINNERS\r\n\r\nA picnic, to serve its true end, ought to be a season of healthful\r\nrecreation; but seemingly, in the general acceptation of the term, a\r\npicnic means an occasion for a big dinner composed of sweets and\r\ndainties, wines, ices, and other delectable delicacies, which tempt to\r\nsurfeiting and excess. The preparation necessary for such a dinner\r\nusually requires a great amount of extra and wearisome labor, while the\r\neating is very apt to leave results which quite overshadow any benefit\r\nderived from the recreative features of the occasion. It is generally\r\nsupposed that a picnic is something greatly conducive to health; but\r\nwhere everything is thus made subservient to appetite, it is one of the\r\nmost unhygienic things imaginable.\r\n\r\nThe lunch basket should contain ample provision for fresh-air-sharpened\r\nappetites, but let the food be as simple as possible, and of not too\r\ngreat variety. Good whole-wheat or Graham bread in some form, with well\r\nsterilized milk and cream, or a soup previously prepared from grains or\r\nlegumes, which can be readily heated with the aid of a small alcohol or\r\nkerosene stove, and plenty of fruit of seasonable variety, will\r\nconstitute a very good bill of fare. If cake is desirable, let it be of\r\na very simple kind, like the buns or raised cake for which directions\r\nare given in another chapter. Beaten biscuits, rolls, and crisps are\r\nalso serviceable for picnic dinners. Fruit sandwiches--made by spreading\r\nslices of light whole-wheat or Graham bread with a little whipped cream\r\nand then with fresh fruit jam lightly sweetened, with fig sauce or\r\nsteamed figs chopped, steamed prunes or sliced bananas--are most\r\nrelishable. These should be made on the ground, just before serving,\r\nfrom material previously prepared. An egg sandwich may be prepared in\r\nthe same manner by substituting for the fruit the hard-boiled yolks of\r\neggs chopped with a very little of the whitest and tenderest celery, and\r\nseasoned lightly with salt. Two pleasing and palatable picnic breads may\r\nbe made as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECIPES._\r\n\r\nPICNIC BISCUIT.--Prepare a dough as for Raised Biscuit, page 145,\r\nand when thoroughly kneaded the last time, divide, and roll both\r\nportions to about one fourth of an inch in thickness. Spread one portion\r\nwith stoned dates, or figs that have been chopped or cut fine with\r\nscissors, cover with the second portion, and cut into fancy shapes. Let\r\nthe biscuits rise until very light, and bake. Wash the tops with milk to\r\nglace before baking.\r\n\r\nFIG WAFERS.--Rub together equal quantities of Graham meal, and figs\r\nthat have been chopped very fine. Make into a dough with cold sweet\r\ncream. Roll thin, cut in shape, and bake.\r\n\r\nIf provision can be made for the reheating of foods, a soup, or grain,\r\nmacaroni with tomato sauce, or with egg or cream sauce, or some similar\r\narticle which can be cooked at home, transported in sealed fruit cans,\r\nand reheated in a few moments on the grounds, is a desirable addition to\r\nthe picnic bill of fare.\r\n\r\nRecipes for suitable beverages for such occasions will be found in the\r\nchapter on Beverages.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOL LUNCHES.\r\n\r\nMothers whose children are obliged to go long distances to school, are\r\noften greatly perplexed to know what to put up for the noonday lunch\r\nwhich shall be both appetizing and wholesome. The conventional school\r\nlunch of white bread and butter, sandwiches, pickles, mince or other\r\nrich pie, with a variety of cake and cookies, is scarcely better than\r\nnone at all; since on the one hand there is a deficiency of food\r\nmaterial which can be used for the upbuilding of brains, muscles, and\r\nnerves; while on the other hand it contains an abundance of material\r\ncalculated to induce dyspepsia, headache, dullness of intellect, and\r\nother morbid conditions. Left in an ante-room, during the school\r\nsession, until, in cold weather, it becomes nearly frozen, and then\r\npartaken of hurriedly, that there may be more time for play, is it to be\r\nwondered at that the after-dinner session drags so wearily, and that the\r\npupils feel sleepy, dull, and uninterested? Our brains are nourished by\r\nblood made from the food we eat; and if it be formed of improper or\r\nunwholesome food, the result will be a disordered organ, incapable of\r\nfirst-class work.\r\n\r\nAgain, the extra work imposed upon the digestive organs and the liver in\r\ngetting rid of the excess of fats and sugar in rich, unwholesome foods,\r\ncontinually overtaxes these organs.\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be doubted that a large majority of the cases of so-called\r\noverwork from which school children suffer, are caused by violation of\r\nhygienic laws regarding food and diet rather than by an excess of brain\r\nwork; or in other words, had the brain been properly nourished by an\r\nabundance of good, wholesome food, the same amount of work could have\r\nbeen easily accomplished with no detriment whatever.\r\n\r\nWhenever practicable, children should return to their homes for the\r\nmidday lunch, since under the oversight of a wise mother there will be\r\nfewer violations of hygienic laws, and the walk back to the school room\r\nwill be far more conducive to good digestion than the violent exercise\r\nor the sports so often indulged in directly after eating. When this is\r\nimpracticable, let the lunch be as simple as possible, and not so ample\r\nas to tempt the child to overeat. Good whole-wheat or Graham bread of\r\nsome kind, rolls, crisps, beaten biscuit, sticks, fruit rolls, and\r\nwafers, with a cup of canned fruit or a bottle of rich milk as an\r\naccompaniment, with plenty of nice, fresh fruits or almonds or a few\r\nstalks of celery, is as tempting a lunch as any child need desire. It\r\nwould be a good plan to arrange for the heating of a portion of the milk\r\nto be sipped as a hot drink. In many school rooms the ordinary heating\r\nstove will furnish means for this, or a little alcohol stove or a\r\nheating lamp may be used for the purpose, under the supervision of the\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\nFurnish the children with apples, oranges, bananas, pears, grapes,\r\nfilberts, and almonds in place of rich pie and cake. They are just as\r\ncheap as the material used for making the less wholesome sweets, and far\r\neasier of digestion. An occasional plain fruit or grain pudding, cup\r\ncustard, or molded dessert may be substituted for variety. Fruit\r\nsandwiches, or a slice of Stewed Fruit Pudding prepared as directed on\r\npage 308 are also suitable for this purpose.\r\n\r\nRice prepared as directed below makes a wholesome and appetizing article\r\nfor the lunch basket:--\r\n\r\nCREAMY RICE.--Put a pint of milk, one quarter of a cup of best\r\nCarolina rice, a tablespoonful of sugar, and a handful of raisins into\r\nan earthen-ware dish, and place on the top of the range where it will\r\nheat very slowly to boiling temperature. Stir frequently, so that the\r\nrice will not adhere to the bottom of the dish. When boiling, place in\r\nthe oven, and bake till the rice is tender, which can be ascertained by\r\ndipping a spoon into one side and taking out a few grains. Twenty\r\nminutes will generally be sufficient.\r\n\r\nMuch care should be used in putting up the lunch to have it as neat and\r\ndainty as possible. A basket of suitable size covered with a clean white\r\nnapkin is better for use than the conventional dinner pail, in which\r\nair-tight receptacle each food is apt to savor of all the others, making\r\nthe entire contents unappetizing, if not unwholesome.\r\n\r\n\r\nSABBATH DINNERS.\r\n\r\nOne of the most needed reforms in domestic life is a change to more\r\nsimple meals on the Sabbath. In many households the Sabbath is the only\r\nday in the week when all the members of the family can dine together,\r\nand with an aim to making it the most enjoyable day of all, the good\r\nhousewife provides the most elaborate dinner of the week, for the\r\npreparation of which she must either spend an unusual amount of time and\r\nlabor the day previous or must encroach upon the sacred rest day to\r\nperform the work.\r\n\r\nReal enjoyment ought not to be dependent upon feasting and gustatory\r\npleasures. Plain living and high thinking should be the rule at all\r\ntimes, and especially upon the Sabbath day. Nothing could be more\r\nconducive to indigestion and dyspepsia than this general custom of\r\nfeasting on the Sabbath. The extra dishes and especial luxuries tempt to\r\nover-indulgence of appetite; while the lack of customary exercise and\r\nthe gorged condition of the stomach incident upon such hearty meals,\r\nfosters headaches and indigestion and renders brain and mind so inactive\r\nthat the participants feel too dull for meditation and study, too sleepy\r\nto keep awake during service, too languid for anything but dozing and\r\nlounging, and the day that should have fostered spiritual growth is\r\nworse than thrown away. Nor is this all; the evil effects of the\r\nindigestion occasioned are apt to be felt for several succeeding days,\r\nmaking the children irritable and cross, and the older members of the\r\nfamily nervous and impatient,--most certainly an opposite result from\r\nthat which ought to follow a sacred day of rest.\r\n\r\nPhysiologically such feasting is wrong. The wear and consequent repair\r\nincident upon hard labor, calls for an equivalent in food; but when no\r\nlabor is performed, a very moderate allowance--is all that is necessary,\r\nand it should be of easy digestibility. Let the Sabbath meals be simple,\r\nand served with abundant good cheer and intelligent thought as an\r\naccompaniment.\r\n\r\nLet as much as possible of the food be prepared and the necessary work\r\nbe done the day previous, so that the cook may have ample opportunity\r\nwith the other members of the family to enjoy all Sabbath privileges.\r\nThis need by no means necessitate the use of cold food nor entail a\r\ngreat amount of added work in preparation. To illustrate, take the\r\nfollowing--\r\n\r\n    SABBATH BILL OF FARE.\r\n\r\n    BREAKFAST\r\n\r\n    Fresh Fruit\r\n    Rolled Wheat with Cream\r\n    Prune Toast\r\n    Whole-Wheat Bread\r\n    Toasted Waters\r\n    Buns\r\n    Fresh Strawberries\r\n\r\n    DINNER\r\n\r\n    Canned Green Corn Soup\r\n    Creamed Potato\r\n    Green Peas\r\n    Tomato and Macaroni\r\n    Rice\r\n    Toasted Wafers\r\n    Beaten Biscuit\r\n    Buns\r\n    Canned Peaches\r\n    Fruit and Nuts\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth the rolled wheat and rice may be prepared the day previous, as may\r\nalso the prune sauce for the toast, the buns, bread, and nearly all the\r\nother foods. The potatoes can be boiled and sliced, the corn for the\r\nsoup rubbed through the colander and placed in the ice chest, the green\r\npeas boiled but not seasoned, and the macaroni cooked and added to the\r\ntomato but not seasoned. The berries may be hulled, the nuts cracked,\r\nand the canned fruit opened. If the table is laid over night and covered\r\nwith a spread to keep off dust, a very short time will suffice for\r\ngetting the Sabbath breakfast. Heat the rolled wheat in the inner dish\r\nof a double boiler. Meanwhile moisten the toast; and heat the prune\r\nsauce.\r\n\r\nTo prepare the dinner, all that is necessary is to add to the material\r\nfor soup the requisite amount of milk and seasoning, and heat to\r\nboiling; heat and season the peas and macaroni; make a cream sauce and\r\nadd the potatoes; reheat the rice, which should have been cooked by\r\nsteaming after the recipe given on page 99.\r\n\r\nAll may be done in half an hour, while the table is being laid, and with\r\nvery little labor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE TOPICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER.\r\n\r\n     To the days of the aged it
