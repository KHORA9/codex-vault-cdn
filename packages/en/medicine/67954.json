That organization had been in\r\nexistence in Europe for more than five years, but the number of people\r\nin America who knew anything about it was exceedingly small. The United\r\nStates was not then a member of the international organization which\r\nrecognized the Red Cross, nor did it become a member for many years\r\nthereafter. This was not because the United States Government did not\r\nknow about it, but because this country had no purpose or desire to\r\njoin in an organization established in Europe for purposes in which it\r\nwas generally believed this country had no occasion to participate.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to be explicit on this subject. The meeting which\r\ngave the Red Cross to the world took place at Geneva, Switzerland,\r\non February 29, 1863. At the call of a committee, which already had\r\nbehind it the formal endorsement of eleven national governments, the\r\ninternational organization was formed in Geneva on August 22, 1864. At\r\nthis meeting the cross of red upon a white ground was adopted as the\r\ninsignia of the convention. Twenty-two governments promptly gave their\r\nadherence to this convention. The United States was not among them,\r\nalthough it had been formally invited to be present.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cross did not lack for an advocate in America in that early\r\nday. The Reverend Henry W. Bellows, D.D., chairman of the Sanitary\r\nCommission of the United States, earnestly desired that America should\r\nhave been among the original nations adhering to the treaty; but his\r\npleadings were met with indifference and with pronounced opposition.\r\nMr. George P. Fogg, United States Minister to Switzerland, and Mr.\r\nCharles S. P. Bowles, European Agent of the Sanitary Commission, were\r\ninformally present at the Geneva Convention. The Secretary of State\r\nauthorized Mr. Fogg “to attend the meeting in an informal manner, for\r\nthe purpose of giving or receiving such suggestions as you may think\r\nlikely to promote the humane ends which have prompted it.” He added\r\nthat Mr. Fogg was not to attend if any emissary of the Confederate\r\nGovernment was allowed to be there.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting and gratifying to know that Mr. Bowles was able to\r\nreport to the convention concerning the important work done in America\r\nby the Sanitary Commission. But neither Mr. Fogg nor Mr. Bowles could\r\ngive any assurance that the United States would do anything toward\r\nthe formal endorsement of the Red Cross, or become a member of the\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nDr. Bellows exhausted all his efforts to secure some recognition of the\r\nmovement in America, and finally gave it up in despair. From February\r\n9, 1863, when the movement began in Geneva, until May 20, 1881, when\r\nJames G. Blaine wrote to Clara Barton that President Garfield would\r\nrecommend to Congress the adoption of the international treaty, was\r\na period of eighteen years, during which time the United States of\r\nAmerica turned a deaf ear to every entreaty to participate in the work\r\nof the Red Cross. That the United States even at that late date came to\r\nbe a participant in the results of the Geneva Convention was due to the\r\nuntiring faith, devotion, and perseverance of Clara Barton.\r\n\r\nShe was not one among many good women working for this common end. She\r\nwas not a member of a committee or other organization beginning feebly,\r\nbut gradually gaining strength until the object was accomplished. Alone\r\nshe learned of the Red Cross; alone she brought tidings of it back to\r\nher own country; alone she wrote of it, talked of it, brought it to the\r\nattention of distinguished men, carried her faith in it from desk to\r\ndesk in Washington, and cherished the hope of it through long years,\r\nuntil just before the assassination of President Garfield, she received\r\nfrom him, through his Secretary of State, the assurance that the United\r\nStates would accept the treaty which thirty-one national governments\r\nhad previously adopted.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1869, Clara Barton went abroad in quest of health. For\r\nseveral months following the loss of her voice on the platform she had\r\nbeen fighting nervous prostration in America, and had found that she\r\nmust turn her back on everything that suggested work. Acting under\r\nmedical advice, she sailed in September, and, after a short sojourn\r\nin Scotland with no more than a look at London and Paris, she came to\r\nGeneva in Switzerland, bearing letters of introduction from the Swiss\r\nMinister in Washington, the Honorable John Hitz, to the American\r\nConsul and the American Ambassador. It was there Clara Barton learned\r\nof the Red Cross.\r\n\r\nHad she but known it, a Red Cross Society had actually been formed\r\nin the United States in 1866, but had died without securing national\r\nrecognition or attracting public attention. Of that organization we\r\nshall have occasion to speak hereafter. It was called “The American\r\nAssociation for the Relief of the Misery of Battlefields.” Information\r\nconcerning it is preserved in a letter of the Reverend Henry W.\r\nBellows, D.D., President, to Monsieur J. Henri Dunant, Secrétaire du\r\n“Comité International de Secours aux Militaires Blessés.” The few\r\npeople who knew of this organization in 1866 had very nearly forgotten\r\nabout it by 1869, and its great-hearted organizer, Dr. Bellows, had\r\nbecome completely discouraged with respect to any recognition of\r\nthe movement in America. How Clara Barton came into touch with this\r\norganization as it existed abroad she told in a lecture which she\r\nprepared and delivered in a number of places on her return from Europe\r\nat the close of the Franco-Prussian War. As during this period her\r\nhealth was so poor that her diary was kept with great irregularity,\r\nthis lecture gives us our best account of her journey and succeeding\r\nevents:\r\n\r\n Most of you, I presume, know of me only as connected with our own war,\r\n and probably little of that, and, unless I give a word of explanation,\r\n it will remain a mystery to you how I ever came near a war in another\r\n country, and, in military parlance, we must connect the two by a\r\n “pontoon bridge,” and get ourselves across on it.\r\n\r\n Our war closed in the spring of ’65. Almost four years longer I worked\r\n among the débris, gathering up the wrecks, and sometimes, during the\r\n lecture season, telling a few simple war-stories to the people over\r\n the country, in their halls and churches.\r\n\r\n One early winter evening in ’68 I stood on the platform of one of the\r\n finest new opera houses in the East, filled to repletion, it seemed\r\n to me, with the most charming audience I had ever beheld,--plumed and\r\n jeweled ladies, stalwart youths, reverend white-haired men. Gradually,\r\n and to my horror, I felt my voice giving out, leaving me; the next\r\n moment I opened my mouth, but no sound followed. Again, and again,\r\n and again I attempted it, with no result. It was finished! Nervous\r\n prostration had declared itself. I went to my home in Washington,\r\n lay helpless all winter. Finally, by my physicians I was ordered to\r\n Europe, and in early September, ’69, I was able to go.\r\n\r\n I came in time to Geneva, when, while we were waiting, anticipating\r\n and settling ourselves, one day there was announced a visit from a\r\n body of Geneva gentlemen, having some business with me.\r\n\r\n They introduced themselves as the officers of a society known as\r\n the International Convention of Geneva,--more familiarly, the Red\r\n Cross,--having for its object the amelioration of the sufferings of\r\n war, the succor and nursing of the wounded and sick in battle, the\r\n relief of prisoners, the guarding against famine and pestilence, and\r\n whatever may befall a people, under the scourge of war.\r\n\r\n And this, in its international character, extends not alone to its\r\n own, but to all nations within the compact.\r\n\r\n This society had been formed in 1865, at the instance of Dr. Louis\r\n Appia,--there present,--a noted surgeon in the Italian wars of\r\n Napoleon III, who had at that date called a convention composed of\r\n delegates from the civilized nations of the whole world, formed\r\n their laws for international neutral action in all wars extending\r\n to all peoples, framed their treaty and presented it for signature,\r\n through the delegates present, to the nations which they respectively\r\n represented. In less than two years this compact had been signed and\r\n entered into by twenty-five distinct governments comprising all the\r\n civilized and some semi-civilized nations of the globe.\r\n\r\n With your kind permission, I will depart for a few moments from my\r\n narrative and speak of the nature of the international compact, which\r\n may not be familiar to you.\r\n\r\n This treaty, consisting of ten articles, and making material changes\r\n in the articles of war governing the medical and hospital departments\r\n of all armies, provided among other things for entire neutrality\r\n concerning all hospitals for the care of sick and wounded men; that\r\n they should not be subject to capture; that not only the sick and\r\n wounded themselves, but the persons in attendance upon them, as\r\n surgeons, hospital stewards, and nurses should be held neutral, and\r\n free from capture; that surgeons, chaplains, and nurses, in attendance\r\n upon the wounded of a battle-field at the time of its surrender,\r\n should be regarded as non-combatants, not subject to capture, and\r\n left unmolested to care for the wounded so long as any remained upon\r\n the field, and, when no longer needed for this, be safely escorted to\r\n their own lines, and given up; that soldiers too badly wounded to be\r\n capable of again bearing arms should not be carried away as prisoners,\r\n but offered to their own army if in retreat it could take them. They\r\n must be placed in hospitals and cared for, side by side with the\r\n wounded of the enemy; that all convoys of wounded or evacuations of\r\n posts should be protected by absolute neutrality; that all supplies\r\n designed for the use of the sick or wounded should be held as neutral\r\n and entirely exempt from capture by either belligerent army; that\r\n it should be the duty of both generals in command to apprise the\r\n inhabitants, in the vicinity of a battle about to take place, of the\r\n fact that any house which should take in and entertain the wounded of\r\n either side would be placed under military protection, and remain so\r\n as long as any wounded remained therein, and that they would be also\r\n exempt from the quartering of troops and ordinary contributions of\r\n war, thus literally converting every house in the vicinity of a battle\r\n into a furnished hospital and making nurses of its inmates.\r\n\r\n In order to carry into effect these great changes, it would be needful\r\n to have some one distinctive sign, a badge by which all these neutral\r\n peoples and stores could be designated. There must be but one hospital\r\n flag among all nations within the treaty, and this same sign must\r\n mark all persons and things belonging to it. The convention studied\r\n diligently for this sign; at length it got so far as to decide that a\r\n cross would be acceptable to nearly all peoples. They next said, “We\r\n represent here the great war-making monarchy of the world.”\r\n\r\n This little Republic of Switzerland, so small that one of us could\r\n crush her between our thumb and finger, has had the courage to invite\r\n us here to consider our cruelties and call upon us for some better\r\n system of kindness and humanity than we have heretofore practiced.\r\n For this brave lesson she deserves something of us. We cannot take\r\n her flag; she has fought a thousand years for that, and will not give\r\n it up; but if she permits, we will reverse its colors--a white cross\r\n upon a red ground--and make a red cross on a white ground the one\r\n distinctive sign of humanity in war, the world over. The consent was\r\n given and this committee of gentlemen who had called the convention,\r\n with Monsieur Gustave Moynier as its president, was reëlected by\r\n all the nations as the international medium and head of war relief\r\n throughout the civilized world. To anticipate a little, I would say\r\n here that our adhesion to this treaty in 1882 has changed our articles\r\n of war; our military hospital flag. We have no longer the old faded\r\n yellow flag, but a bright red cross at every post, and the same sign\r\n to be worn by all military surgeons and attendants, if the orders of\r\n the War Department have as yet reached them, for we are to-day, you\r\n will be glad to know, not only in full accord with this International\r\n Treaty of Geneva, but are considered one of the strongest pledged\r\n nations within it.\r\n\r\n There were at this time thirty-one nations in this great compact,\r\n comprising all the civilized and even some of the semi-civilized\r\n nations of the globe, all with one great and incomprehensible\r\n exception, the United States of America.\r\n\r\n It had been three times presented to our Government; once at its\r\n formation during our war and twice since, without success, and without\r\n any reason, which, to the members of the convention, seemed sufficient\r\n or intelligent.\r\n\r\n And it was to ask of me the real nature of the grounds of this\r\n declination that the interview had been sought.\r\n\r\n If there were something objectionable in their articles, they might\r\n be modified to meet our laws, or even our prejudices--that some clue\r\n might be gained, which they could understand. They had thought of\r\n everything. If it had originated in a monarchical government, they\r\n could see some justifiable caution, but a sister Republic older than\r\n our own--and yet all monarchies had signed it. In their perplexity\r\n they had come to me for a solution of the problem. What could I say?\r\n What could each or any of you have said, if confronted with this\r\n question?\r\n\r\n Simply that you did not know anything about it, and you were sure the\r\n American people did not know anything about it, or ever had heard of\r\n it. That the Government, or rather some officer of the Government,\r\n to whom the matter had been assigned, had decided upon and declined\r\n it individually, and it had never been considered in the national\r\n councils, nor in any way made known to the people.\r\n\r\n I knew it must be so: that it had simply gone by default with no real\r\n objection; that our Government was too rushing to attend to details\r\n outside of political influence.\r\n\r\n I could only answer these gentlemen that I feared the matter was not\r\n sufficiently understood, being in a foreign language, and I hoped it\r\n could be better presented at some future time. I need not say that\r\n this committee of seven members and myself became friends.\r\n\r\n I read their Articles of Convention, their published bulletins and all\r\n reports, and, as we progress, we shall see if, in the dark days that\r\n followed, I found reason to respect the cause and appreciate the work\r\n of the Geneva Convention.\r\n\r\nOn Miss Barton’s arrival in Switzerland she made her home with the\r\nGolay family, father and mother of Jules Golay whom she had befriended\r\nin America, and who extended to her every possible courtesy while she\r\nwas in their home and in their country.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland is beautiful in summer and early autumn, but in winter\r\nit is no improvement on New England. The beginning of cold weather\r\nfound Miss Barton in discomfort. She celebrated Thanksgiving, and soon\r\nafterward left Switzerland for a milder climate.\r\n\r\nShe had a cordial invitation to spend the winter in London, but\r\ndeclined the opportunity. London fogs are inhospitable even to\r\nLondoners, and, to any one in Clara Barton’s condition of health, they\r\nare most depressing. She determined instead to go to the Island of\r\nCorsica.\r\n\r\nCorsica did not agree with Clara Barton. The mild weather was\r\nfavorable, but she found that she needed as much quinine there as she\r\nhad required in the South. In the spring she returned to Switzerland,\r\nwhere her home was at the United States Consulate with Mr. and Mrs.\r\nUpton, and where she resided from March until the 26th of May. Then\r\nshe went to Berne for the sake of some baths which had been highly\r\nrecommended to her. While there, an event occurred which caused her to\r\nforget that she was an invalid in search of health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Miss Barton was at Berne, in the villa of a friend, the\r\nFranco-Prussian War broke suddenly upon Europe. Nothing that happens in\r\nFrance or Germany fails to register influence at once on Switzerland.\r\nWhile she was there she received a call from Louise, the Grand Duchess\r\nof Baden, who, having learned of the presence there of an American\r\nwoman so distinguished in war relief, invited her to go to Strassburg,\r\nwhich was in a state of siege, and prepare for the relief which already\r\nhad become necessary and soon would be urgent. The baths were not so\r\ncomplete a tonic as this call to service. Yet it did not seem to her\r\nthat she was strong enough to undertake this work.\r\n\r\nOnly a little later she had another invitation from Dr. Louis Appia,\r\nwho had been one of the movers in the Geneva Convention. This was her\r\nopportunity to witness the actual work of the organization of which she\r\nhad heard:\r\n\r\n On the 15th of July, 1870, France declared war against Prussia.\r\n Within three days a band of agents from the International Committee\r\n of Geneva, headed by Dr. Louis Appia (one of the prime movers of\r\n the convention), equipped for work and _en route_ for the seat of\r\n war, stood at the door of my villa inviting me to go with them and\r\n take such part as I had taken in our own war. I had not strength to\r\n trust for that, and declined with thanks, promising to follow in my\r\n own time and way, and I did follow within a week. No shot had been\r\n fired--no man had fallen. Yet this organized, powerful commission\r\n was on its way, with its skilled agents, ready to receive, direct,\r\n and dispense the charities and accumulations which the generous\r\n sympathies of twenty-two nations, if applied to, might place at\r\n its disposal. These men had treaty power to go directly on to any\r\n field, and work unmolested in full cooperation with the military and\r\n commanders-in-chief; their supplies held sacred and their efforts\r\n recognized and seconded in every direction by either belligerent army.\r\n Not a man could lie uncared for nor unfed. I thought of the Peninsula\r\n in McClellan’s campaign, of Pittsburg Landing, Cedar Mountain, and\r\n second Bull Run, Antietam, Old Fredericksburg, with its acres of\r\n snow-covered and gun-covered glacée, and its fourth-day flag of\r\n truce; of its dead, and starving wounded, frozen to the ground, and\r\n our commission and their supplies in Washington, with no effective\r\n organization to get beyond; of the Petersburg mine, with its four\r\n thousand dead and wounded and no flag of truce, the wounded broiling\r\n in a July sun, dying and rotting where they fell. I remembered our\r\n prisons, crowded with starving men whom all the powers and pities\r\n of the world could not reach even with a bit of bread. I thought of\r\n the widows’ weeds still fresh and dark through all the land, north\r\n and south, from the pine to the palm; the shadows on the hearths and\r\n hearts over all my country. Sore, broken hearts, ruined, desolate\r\n homes! Was this a people to decline a humanity in war? Was this a\r\n country to reject a treaty for the help of wounded soldiers? Were\r\n these the women and men to stand aloof and consider? I believed, if\r\n these people knew that the last cloud of war had forever passed from\r\n their horizon, the tender, painful, deathless memories of what had\r\n been would bring them in with a force no power could resist. They\r\n needed only to know.\r\n\r\nSoon Clara Barton was on her way to the front. She went, not to\r\nStrassburg, but to Basle, where she witnessed with great satisfaction\r\nthe efficiency of the Red Cross system. Basle is in Switzerland, just\r\nat the German border, but there representatives of both belligerent\r\nnations had their headquarters for purposes of relief of suffering.\r\nThe Red Cross, protected by international agreement, had its base of\r\nsupplies in neutral territory, and the agents of both armies organized\r\ntheir relief forces without molestation from each other. Wherever\r\na battle occurred, relief could be and was provided in many cases\r\nbefore the first drop of blood was shed. Miss Barton’s admiration for\r\nthe work of this society grew as she contrasted its efficiency with\r\nthe unpreparedness and deadly delay which she had known all too well\r\nthrough the Civil War:\r\n\r\n As I journeyed on and saw the work of these Red Cross societies\r\n in the field, accomplishing in four months under their systematic\r\n organization what we failed to accomplish in four years without\r\n it--no mistakes, no needless suffering, no starving, no lack of care,\r\n no waste, no confusion, but order, plenty, cleanliness, and comfort\r\n wherever that little flag made its way, a whole continent marshaled\r\n under the banner of the Red Cross--as I saw all this, and joined and\r\n worked in it, you will not wonder that I said to myself, “If I live\r\n to return to my country, I will try to make my people understand the\r\n Red Cross and that treaty.” But I did more than resolve, I promised\r\n other nations I would do it, and other reasons pressed me to remember\r\n my promise. The Franco-Prussian War and the war of the Commune were\r\n both enormous in the extent of their operations and in the suffering\r\n of individuals. This great modern international impulse of charity\r\n went out everywhere to meet and alleviate its miseries. The small,\r\n poor countries gave of their poverty and the rich nations poured out\r\n abundantly of their vast resources. The contributions of those under\r\n the Red Cross went quietly, promptly through international responsible\r\n channels, were thoughtfully and carefully distributed through\r\n well-known agents; returns, accurate to a franc, were made and duly\r\n published to the credit of the contributing nations, and the object\r\n aimed at was accomplished.\r\n\r\n France, Germany, and Switzerland had been in the international compact\r\n for years past, all organized, every town and city with its Red Cross\r\n Relief Committee, its well-filled workrooms like our relief societies\r\n in our war, but all prepared in times of peace and plenty, awaiting\r\n the emergency.\r\n\r\n The Swiss headquarters were at Basle, bordering on both France and\r\n Germany; and there all the supplies were to be sent and held on call\r\n from the hundreds of workers at the fields, for the use of the sick\r\n and wounded of either side indiscriminately wherever the need was\r\n found greatest. The belligerent nations had each its own headquarters;\r\n that of Germany at Berlin, with the Empress Augusta at its head; that\r\n of France, at Paris, under the auspices of its lovely Empress.\r\n\r\n But you will understand that the international feature of this\r\n requires that all contributions from other nations be sent through\r\n the international headquarters; hence, no people within the compact,\r\n except the belligerents, could send direct to either France or\r\n Germany, but must correspond with the Central Committee at Geneva, and\r\n learn from it the place of greatest need and the proper agents on the\r\n spot to whom the consignment should be made. This wise provision both\r\n marked and sustained their neutrality.\r\n\r\n Up to this moment, no point beyond Basle had been reached. This was,\r\n then, the great central dépôt of the International Red Cross, and it\r\n was worth something to have seen it as I saw it in less than two weeks\r\n after the sudden declaration, a declaration as unexpected as if some\r\n nation should declare war against us to-morrow.\r\n\r\n My first steps were to the storehouses, and to my amazement I\r\n found there a larger supply than I had ever seen at any one time\r\n in readiness for the field at our own Sanitary Commission rooms in\r\n Washington, even in the fourth year of the war; and the trains were\r\n loaded with boxes and barrels pouring in from every city, town, and\r\n hamlet in Switzerland, even from Austria and northern Italy, and the\r\n trained, educated nurses stood awaiting their appointments, each with\r\n this badge upon the arm or breast, and every box, package, or barrel\r\n with a broad bright scarlet cross, which rendered it as safe and\r\n sacred from molestation (one might almost say) as the bread and wine\r\n before the altar.\r\n\r\n You will conclude that quiet old historic Basle was, by this time,\r\n a busy city. It was frightened out of its senses. Bordering on both\r\n France and Germany, it lay directly on the possible march of either\r\n army on its way to the other; and the moment Switzerland shall allow\r\n this crossing, her neutrality will be declared broken, and not only\r\n Basle, but all Switzerland, will be held in a state of actual war and\r\n become common battleground for both.\r\n\r\n I passed a week in that city among this work, to learn it more\r\n thoroughly, to be able to judge it in its practical bearings,\r\n its merits and demerits, so far as I could, before giving my\r\n qualifications and endorsement. You will not wonder that Basle felt\r\n her responsibility and trembled for both her own safety and the safety\r\n of the State!\r\n\r\nNot very long did she remain in Basle. Soon a dispatch was received\r\nfrom Mülhausen, and Clara Barton, no longer an invalid, set out\r\nagain for the front. She was not alone; accompanying her was a young\r\nwoman who thenceforth became her companion, and who some years later\r\nfollowed her to America, Miss Antoinette Margot. Accompanied by this\r\ndevoted girl, she set forth as she had done nine years before, for\r\nthe relief of suffering on the battle-field. She told the story of it\r\nin an address which she gave afterward, which was little more than a\r\ntranscript of her diary:\r\n\r\n A mile from Basle, we met the pickets, but passed without serious\r\n interruption for the first six miles, when the detentions became\r\n longer, and the road lined with fugitives fleeing to Switzerland,\r\n entire families, carrying such articles as were possible: the better\r\n classes in family and public carriages; the next, in farmer and\r\n peasant wagons, drawn by horses, oxen, cows, and often the animals\r\n of the family accompanying the wagon which contained the most useful\r\n articles for an emergency--kettles, beds, and clothing.\r\n\r\n Those who could not afford this style of removal were wearily but\r\n hastily trudging along on foot, carrying in their arms such as their\r\n strength would allow, and the tired children plodding along on behind,\r\n or drawn in little carts, with bundles of clothing and bits of bread.\r\n\r\n Sometimes a family was fortunate to have a cow or a goat with them\r\n when they had no wagon. Sometimes, after the Bernese custom, a large\r\n dog drew the wagon of luggage. But in some manner all were making on,\r\n often in tears, and always with grief in their faces. All day we saw\r\n but two carriages going in our direction. But all whom we met looked\r\n at us in astonishment. “The Prussians are coming,” or, “There has been\r\n a terrible battle and everybody is being killed. _Turn back, turn\r\n back!_”\r\n\r\n Sometimes one would be so earnest as to come to the heads of our\r\n horses, to urge us to return, and it was not always easy to keep our\r\n driver in heart.\r\n\r\n At ---- we were met and stopped by a large body of people, the mayor\r\n at the head, and our destination inquired, and at the same time\r\n informed that it was exceedingly hazardous to proceed, as great\r\n battles were going on at a short distance from Mülhausen, and that\r\n the Prussians were crossing the Rhine in great force. But when to all\r\n this we replied that we were aware of the state of things, and that\r\n was the reason of our going, that we went to care for the wounded\r\n of the battles, they all cried with one voice, “Mon Dieu--God bless\r\n you,” and the old white-haired mayor led the way to the side of our\r\n carriage, to take our hands, exclaiming, “God preserve and be with\r\n you, my children, and He is with you, or you would not be here on this\r\n mission.” And the crowd that jostled in the street, one after another,\r\n followed his example, with the tears falling over their faces, even to\r\n the little children to whom we reached down our hands to reach theirs,\r\n or to touch them as they were held up to us.\r\n\r\n No wonder they wept! Their fathers, sons, and brothers would be in the\r\n bloody carnage so soon to follow. Already they had bade to God only\r\n knows how many the last farewell.\r\n\r\n At length they let go our bridles and we passed on, and, with such\r\n scenes every moment in some form occurring, we performed the remainder\r\n of our journey to Mülhausen.\r\n\r\n We made our way directly to the President of the International\r\n Committee of the Red Cross of Mülhausen, Monsieur August Dolfus.\r\n\r\n A dispatch had just been received from the International Committee\r\n of the Red Cross at Mülhausen, France, inviting me to come there.\r\n Dr. Appia and his noble band of pioneers had evidently passed that\r\n way. This would be in a direct line to Strassburg, and the field\r\n of Weissenburg, and I decided to leave by the earliest train next\r\n morning.\r\n\r\n As good fortune would have it, there came to me at this moment a\r\n kind-featured, gentle-toned, intelligent Swiss girl, who had left the\r\n _canter de vaud_ to go alone to care for the wounded. The society\r\n introduced her to me.\r\n\r\n Perhaps it would be well to anticipate so far as to speak of this\r\n young lady more fully, for all through you will know her as my\r\n faithful Antoinette--Antoinette Margot, Swiss by birth, French by\r\n cultivation, education, and habit. The two national characteristics\r\n met and joined in her. The enthusiasm of the one, the fidelity of the\r\n other, were so perfectly blended and balanced in her, that one could\r\n never determine which prevailed. No matter, as both were unquenchable,\r\n unconquerable. She was raised in the city of Lyons, France, an only\r\n daughter, and at that age an artist of great note, even in the schools\r\n of artistic France. Fair-haired, playful, bright, and confiding,\r\n she spoke English as learned from books, and selected her forms of\r\n expression by inference. One day she made the remark that something\r\n was “unpretty.” Observing a smile on my face, she asked if that were\r\n not correct. I replied that we do not say “unpretty” in English.\r\n “No. But you say unwise, unselfish, unkind, and ungrateful--why not\r\n unpretty?” “I do not know,” I answered. I didn’t either.\r\n\r\n There was something in that face to be drawn to “at sight,” and to her\r\n astonishment and delight I told her she might accompany me.\r\n\r\n Scarce was this arrangement completed when breathless messengers\r\n rushed to tell us that the French still fled before the troops of\r\n the Prince Royal, that the Prussians were marching direct upon the\r\n Rhine, if indeed it were not already crossed, and that the French had\r\n destroyed their railroad to Strassburg, that the rolling-stock of the\r\n road had been run off to save it, and that even the station was closed.\r\n\r\n This was after dark--the news was not of a nature to favor delay.\r\n Instead of five o’clock by train next morning, I would start at\r\n daybreak by private carriage.\r\n\r\n At length a _cochère_ was found who would undertake the journey--the\r\n task of driving to Mülhausen for a consideration which, under the\r\n circumstances, it was quite possible for him to obtain. At the\r\n appointed hour, with some small satchels, the requisite supply of\r\n shawls and waterproofs, with my quiet, sensible young companion, I set\r\n off once more, shall I say--for “_the front_”? That expression was\r\n very strange after a lapse of five years, and I had thought never to\r\n hear it again in connection with myself.\r\n\r\nArriving at Mülhausen, Miss Barton found there was no present need\r\nof her services. She determined to set forth for Strassburg. With\r\ngreat difficulty she made her way thither. Through rain and mud, with\r\nconveyance almost impossible to obtain, she finally arrived, a distance\r\nof seventy-two miles, which journey she completed in a single day.\r\n\r\nShe was received with honor at Strassburg. The United States Consul and\r\nVice-Consul were both Germans, but both had fought in the Civil War on\r\nthe side of the Union, and they both knew of Clara Barton. The Consul\r\nhad been a surgeon and the Vice-Consul a chaplain. Both welcomed her to\r\nthe Consulate and to their homes.\r\n\r\nBut Strassburg was about to undergo bombardment. The city was then\r\nunder French rule, but its population was mixed. It contained besides\r\nits own proper inhabitants many German-Americans just then eager\r\nto get out of Alsace. The Consul got an omnibus full of them, with\r\nClara Barton in the van, and set out to place them inside the German\r\nlines. He took them as far as he was allowed to go, and turned back on\r\nhorseback. Clara Barton and her omnibus full of people moved on. They\r\ncarried the American flag. Part of the way it served to enable them to\r\npass the sentries. But when they reached the German outposts, it ceased\r\nto afford them safe passage:\r\n\r\n We had the United States flag at our front, and the first sentry\r\n halted us to learn what it was. When informed, he promptly disputed\r\n it. He had been in Mexico, and Guatemala and Australia and the\r\n Sandwich Islands, and it was not the American flag at all. Reference\r\n to a chart of flags convinced him, and we passed. But this made us\r\n aware of a great mistake we had committed.\r\n\r\n In our hurry of getting off in the rain and darkness of the early\r\n morning, we had forgotten our International Red Cross Flag, and all\r\n our insignia. There was no return--as well seek to go back through the\r\n gates of death. We must trust to luck.\r\n\r\nAt the demand for the Red Cross insignia by the keen, acute sentry,\r\nMiss Barton retired, seized the bow of red ribbon, without which color\r\nshe was seldom seen, and twisted it into a red cross which, with the\r\nthread and needle taken from her pocket, she sewed upon her arm.\r\n\r\n The next sentinel, about a league from Strassburg, recognized our\r\n flag, saluted it, and did not even halt us.\r\n\r\nThese were the conditions under which, for the first time, Clara\r\nBarton wore the insignia which, in America, was destined to be forever\r\nassociated with her name.\r\n\r\nThe outer German sentinels were now safely passed; but before she was\r\npermitted to enter the lines of the German army she was informed that\r\nif she entered she must remain. She might return if she wished within\r\nthe French lines, or she might make her way again into Switzerland,\r\nbut if she entered the German lines she must be willing to remain\r\nthere until the termination of the war. She had no desire to go back\r\nto Strassburg and submit to the bombardment. She did not now desire\r\nto return to neutral territory. She entered the German lines and made\r\nher way to Carlsruhe, where she was a guest in the home of the Duke\r\nof Baden. She and the Grand Duchess Louise became devoted friends.\r\nThe last letter Clara Barton wrote before her death, and with the\r\nknowledge that she had but a few hours to live, was written to the\r\nGrand Duchess Louise. Among the tributes that lay upon the grave of\r\nClara Barton when the earth closed over her was a beautiful laurel\r\nwreath from the Grand Duchess Louise.\r\n\r\nIt was an accident that put Clara Barton inside the German lines. She\r\nhad planned it otherwise when she went to Strassburg. She had rather\r\nexpected that her work would be to the wounded French, but the fortunes\r\nof war put her within the opposing lines, and to her it mattered\r\nlittle. Her interests were not those of a belligerent. She was ready to\r\nminister to the suffering of either army.\r\n\r\nAgain Clara Barton was on the battle-field. From Carlsruhe she visited\r\nin succession several of the bloody fields. But when Strassburg fell,\r\nas it did September 28, 1870, she turned her back upon the comforts of\r\nthe grand ducal palace, and entered the city where a few weeks before\r\nshe had been the honored guest of the United States Consul. Thousands\r\nof its inhabitants were homeless and in danger of starvation. She\r\norganized a workroom where she set two hundred and fifty poor women\r\nto work. For forty days she and Antoinette Margot did their work amid\r\nthe ruins of this distressed city. At first there was nothing to do\r\nbut to give relief on application. There lie before the writer some of\r\nthe original meal tickets which were issued at this time. But before\r\nlong she saw that this plan if continued, would pauperize the women.\r\nShe devised the plan by which they were to work and be paid for it\r\nwhenever they were able to work. She wrote a letter to Count Bismarck,\r\nbeing introduced to him by the Grand Duchess Louise, and which obtained\r\nofficial recognition for her type of work:\r\n\r\n  COUNT BISMARCK\r\n  Governor-General of Alsace\r\n  HONORED COUNT:\r\n\r\n Through the politeness of your adjutant and his amiable lady, I learn\r\n that Your Highness will kindly permit me to communicate with you in\r\n reference to the work I am endeavoring to perform among the destitute\r\n people who are so fortunate as to fall under your protecting care. But\r\n speaking no German, lacking confidence to attempt a conversation in\r\n French, and fearing that English may not be familiar to you, I decide\r\n to write, subject to translation, the little explanation I would make\r\n of my work, its origin, progress, and design.\r\n\r\n I entered Strassburg the second day after its fall, and, observing\r\n both the distress of its inhabitants and their bitterness toward their\r\n captors, who must always remain their neighbors, I deemed it wise,\r\n while they should receive the charity so much needed, that something\r\n of it be presented by German hands. In this view I was most cordially\r\n met by that noblest of ladies, the Grand Duchess of Baden, to whom\r\n I am also indebted for this introduction to you, and immediately,\r\n under her generous patronage, I returned with an assistant to do\r\n what we could in the name of Germany. At first, we could only give\r\n indiscriminately to the hundreds who thronged our doors. But,\r\n directly, I perceived that a prolonged continuance of this system\r\n would be productive of greater disaster to the _moral_ condition of\r\n the people than the bombardment had been to their physical; that in a\r\n city, comprising less than eighty thousand inhabitants, there would\r\n shortly be twenty thousand confirmed beggars. Only a small proportion\r\n of these families had been accustomed to receive charity, but one\r\n winter of common beggary would reduce the larger part to a state of\r\n careless degradation from which they would scarcely again emerge. It\r\n seemed morally indispensable that remunerative employment in some form\r\n should be given them. Again I consulted Her Royal Highness, who kindly\r\n approved, generously making the first contribution of materials, and\r\n we opened our present “Work-rooms for Women” in the month of October.\r\n To say that the results have surpassed my most sanguine expectation\r\n is little, the facts are much more; but a stranger both to people and\r\n language, it is not singular that my work, which depends entirely\r\n upon public patronage, has often lacked the necessary means to attain\r\n the full measure of success.\r\n\r\n My original design was to aid not only the inhabitants of Strassburg,\r\n but those in other portions of Alsace who are equally destitute. I\r\n thought that to be just to all and produce the best moral influence,\r\n the employment, and the payment, should be given to Strassburg, thus\r\n making of the inhabitants _workers_, instead of _beggars_, but that\r\n the warm garments made by them should be sent to the half-naked\r\n peasants of the villages, and little country homes where the harvest\r\n has been lost, and neither money nor clothing comes within reach.\r\n And to the extent of my means I have done this. The peasants have\r\n heard of the rooms, and often walk two and three leagues to ask for\r\n garments, and the clergymen from around the old battle-fields, and\r\n from Bitch, are making appeals in behalf of their half-naked and\r\n shivering people. Both my sympathy and my judgment would favor the\r\n hearing of these appeals so far as possible. This population must\r\n always be the neighbors, if not a part, of the German people; it\r\n will be most desirable that they should be also friends; they are\r\n in distress--their hearts can never be better reached than now; the\r\n little seed sown to-day may have in it the germs of future peace or\r\n war.\r\n\r\n But pardon my boldness, Honored Count; I am neither a diplomatist nor\r\n political counselor; I am only a maker of garments for the poor.\r\n\r\n I have objected to the purchasing of materials for my work\r\n from magazines, believing that, if the attention of some large\r\n manufacturers of stuffs were called to the subject, materials could be\r\n supplied in a much better manner.\r\n\r\n Other noble societies, I rejoice to say, have sprung up later, all of\r\n which I believe will confine their praiseworthy efforts to the city\r\n of Strassburg, and in every respect but that of affording employment\r\n will, I trust, prove sufficient for the necessities. My little work\r\n has been the pioneer, that ploughed through the earliest and deepest\r\n drifts, and which, though often weary and disheartened, still seeks\r\n to push beyond the beaten track, over the fields, and along the\r\n hillsides, and gather the sufferers out of the storm.\r\n\r\n After this, I fear too lengthy, explanation, will Your Highness kindly\r\n permit me, for the sake of perspicuity, to arrange under two or three\r\n distinct heads the prominent features of my work.\r\n\r\n 1st, I desire to give employment, and payment therefor at the usual\r\n rates, to some portion of the destitute families of Strassburg.\r\n\r\n 2d, To distribute the garments made by them among the people of the\r\n surrounding districts which have been reduced by the calamities of the\r\n war.\r\n\r\n 3d, That, beyond this, I design to make no appropriations of\r\n charities, but to refer all such applicants residing within the city\r\n to the various societies and committees of the same.\r\n\r\n 4th, To attain this object and carry on the work is required,\r\n material, in warm stuffs of both wool and cotton, suitable for\r\n clothing for working-men, women, and children.\r\n\r\n 5th, Money to pay the workers,--sufficient for the number employed.\r\n\r\n STRASSBURG, Dec. 9th, 1870\r\n\r\nMiss Barton also sent an appeal to America for assistance in the\r\npurchase of material. Her letter to the New York “Tribune” brought\r\nher prompt response, and she was not without means for the support of\r\nher work. She used the money which was sent to her in such fashion as\r\nto make it do double duty. She bought material and had it made into\r\ngarments largely by the women who needed those garments for themselves\r\nor their families. She paid them for their work in vouchers--two francs\r\na day, which was good pay; and she sold them the products of their work\r\nat low prices. They received good wages for their labor and good value\r\nfor their wages, but, wherever they were able, they had to work for the\r\nvouchers they got, and pay for the clothing they obtained.\r\n\r\nI have some of the odd little two-franc vouchers which she required\r\nthe women to give. She was not held to any system of accounting, and\r\nwhen there was need she spent money without vouchers; but wherever it\r\nwas feasible, she did her business in a business-like way, and she\r\ntaught the women to be business-like. In her final accounting, only\r\na surprisingly small fraction of her money had been expended without\r\nvouchers.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Day of 1870, her forty-ninth birthday, she wrote to Mrs.\r\nFrances Childs Vassall a letter in which she gave an account of her own\r\nwork and also passed a distinctly unfavorable judgment upon the French\r\nas they appeared to her at that time:\r\n\r\n  “WOMEN’S WORKROOM”\r\n  STRASSBURG, ALSACE, Dec. 25, 1870\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR FANNIE:\r\n\r\n With your usual sagacity you timed your letter _just_ to the moment.\r\n It was Christmas Eve, five o’clock, cold as Greenland. I had sent my\r\n assistants home the day before to enjoy a few days of leisure with\r\n their friends. I sat writing at the farthest end of my large room,\r\n from which only a range of white curtains separated and enclosed me in\r\n my little “counting-room.” The postman’s rap at the door caused me to\r\n look up, and through the curtains I could discern a singular glimmer\r\n of lights like stars, but moving from point to point, as if the\r\n firmament were not satisfied with the arrangement of its luminaries,\r\n and sought the opportunity to rearrange. Startled at first, I rose\r\n from my seat to rush out, but suddenly remembering the evening and\r\n the occasion it occurred to me that my presence at that especial\r\n instant might not be desirable and I reseated. After a minute more of\r\n shifting and fluttering, my little domestic Emily appeared between the\r\n curtains, “Here are two letters, and will you please to walk out.”\r\n The letters were from you and Fannie Atwater, and the walking out\r\n revealed a Christmas tree in full blaze all for myself. It had been\r\n arranged and left by my good ladies before they had departed, with\r\n instructions to the domestics to produce and light it at five o’clock\r\n in the evening. It abounded in fruit and flowers and mosses, and\r\n some little nice things which their good hearts had dictated for my\r\n comfort. And so, in the delicate shadows falling like tracery upon the\r\n snow which spread beneath its branches, I sat me down and read your\r\n dear, welcome letter. Although you did not intend a word of sentiment\r\n in it, nor a touching sentence, I could not truly say that my hand\r\n did not sometimes brush across my eyes as I read; it was so like old\r\n times to receive a whole letter from you, all from you, and all for\r\n me. I knew I did not deserve it. I have been so remiss in writing, and\r\n I don’t know how it happens. I can only account for it on your own\r\n grounds, that when we are occupied and feel that there is something to\r\n say there is no time to say it, and when unoccupied we become listless\r\n and there seems to be nothing to say. I am always disgusted at this\r\n state of things in the human economy, but I can neither reconstruct\r\n nor mend it. It is a little more than a week since I posted a long\r\n letter to Sally all about myself, selfish as could be, and I must not\r\n inflict a similar chapter on you, as you will be compelled to go over\r\n that when it arrives. I am rejoiced to hear from yourself that you are\r\n better than when I left.\r\n\r\n The greatest obstacle I meet in the way of a full restoration of\r\n strength is the utter inability to get sleep enough; an average\r\n of five hours is the maximum. If I by chance succeed in getting a\r\n half-hour beyond this one night, I have it “docked off” the next. When\r\n I was stronger this would do me; I could run my machine at full speed\r\n all day upon this power, and did it for years; but now the belts are\r\n slack and the wheels slip and I lose so much power that my pond is all\r\n drawn off. I should be so glad if I could adopt your plan of a nap in\r\n the afternoon, but I cannot get it unless by mere accident once in a\r\n great while. But I, too, am so much better than when we last saw each\r\n other that I feel I should never mention the subject of health and\r\n strength again while they are as good as at present.\r\n\r\n I thank you for mentioning to me Mrs. Livermore’s lectures. I know she\r\n was a favorite in Worcester; you know she was always a favorite with\r\n me, although I never met her. Madame de Gasparin’s appeal for peace\r\n has found a warm and strong advocate in Mrs. Howe. I hope some good\r\n may come of it. All that you say upon the subject is true, and it is\r\n no small amount of “picking up” that women have to do in consequence\r\n of these reckless fellows; from boyhood to manhood and from manhood\r\n to age, it is all the same. I can never see a poor mutilated wreck\r\n blown to pieces with powder and lead without wondering if visions of\r\n such an end ever flitted before his mother’s mind when she washed\r\n and dressed her fair-skinned baby. Woman should certainly have some\r\n voice in the matter of war, either affirmative or negative, and the\r\n fact that she has not this should not be made the ground on which to\r\n deprive her of other privileges. She shan’t say there will be no war,\r\n and she shan’t take any part in it when there is one, and because she\r\n doesn’t take part in war she mustn’t vote, and because she can’t vote\r\n she has no voice in her government, and because she has no voice in\r\n her government she isn’t a citizen, and because she isn’t a citizen\r\n she has no rights, and because she has no rights she must submit to\r\n wrongs, and because she submits to wrongs she isn’t anybody. What does\r\n she know about war? Because she doesn’t know anything about it, she\r\n mustn’t say or do anything about it. “Three blind mice--cut off their\r\n heads with a carving knife--three blind mice.”\r\n\r\n I pray for peace, and all that may promote it, and if there be a\r\n power on earth which can right the wrongs for which nations go to\r\n war, I pray that it may be made manifest, but when I think I fear.\r\n How supreme an international court must it have been to be able to\r\n induce the Southerners to liberate their slaves or to convince them\r\n that the “mudsills” and “greasy mechanics” and “horned Yankees”\r\n were a people entitled to sufficient respect to be treated on fair\r\n international ground! And how much legislation would it have taken to\r\n convince the world what a worthless bubble of assumption was France,\r\n so utterly unworthy the leadership she assumed, and to have laid her\r\n in all respects so open before the world that it should with one voice\r\n repudiate her leadership and refuse to follow her as heretofore in\r\n frivolity, immorality, folly, fashion, vice, and crime! She seems to\r\n me to have been only one great balloon, and now that the bayonets and\r\n bombs have pierced it full of holes it sends out tens of thousands\r\n of little balloons in its collapse. It is bad for France, but I am\r\n not certain but the lesson will be beneficial to the rest of the\r\n world. I don’t know if we may always trust councils--we had one at\r\n Rome not half a year ago that voted a dogma which turned backward the\r\n progress of enlightened thought two centuries, and how great a power\r\n of legislation would have been required to overthrow that decision!\r\n But I suspect the fear of Victor Emmanuel’s bayonets have seriously\r\n interfered with it. Oh, I don’t know; it is such a mystery, and\r\n mankind the greatest mystery of all! I shall never get it right in\r\n this world, whatever may happen in the one that sets this right. But\r\n how prosy I am--and it all comes of that five hours’ sleep. You know\r\n Beecher says, “If the preacher doesn’t sleep, his hearers will.” I\r\n hope you reserved the reading of this till you were ready for your nap.\r\n\r\nSoon after the fall of Paris, Miss Barton determined to make her\r\nway thither, but before leaving Strassburg she placed before the\r\nauthorities of that city her views of the kind of organization which\r\nshould be permanently established there for the relief of those who\r\nwere suffering by reason of the war. That letter shows how thoroughly\r\nshe understood the problem of administering relief without pauperizing\r\nthe beneficiaries:\r\n\r\n  MONSIEUR BERGMANN\r\n  Membre du Comité de Secours Strasbourgeois\r\n\r\n  MONSIEUR:\r\n\r\n Your very courteous request, that I would present something of my\r\n ideas in reference to the subject of employment for the poor of your\r\n stricken city, demands, perhaps, that I explain, first, the reason\r\n and origin of my own presence here. A long and familiar acquaintance\r\n with the calamities of war led me to direct my steps to the gates of\r\n your besieged city the first day that it was possible to enter, viz.,\r\n September 29th. Not as a matter of curiosity, for bombarded cities had\r\n long ceased to possess any novelty for me, but to ascertain if there\r\n were any _service_ I could render.\r\n\r\n My earliest visit was to your civil hospital, and its wards of wounded\r\n women, which were indeed a novelty in the history of the world. Seeing\r\n no better way of serving them, I took a written account of each woman\r\n at her bedside, what she had suffered, and what she had lost, and,\r\n carrying the sad record, placed it personally in the hand of Her Royal\r\n Highness, the Grand Duchess of Baden, which, I trust, contributed\r\n a little toward directing to your afflicted city the immediate and\r\n active sympathy of that Court and Capital.\r\n\r\n This accomplished, I returned with my present excellent and efficient\r\n assistant, Miss Zimmermann, to learn what further could be done. A\r\n few days’ observation convinced me that, in the majority of instances,\r\n the actual loss of property which had been sustained by the class of\r\n persons who came to demand charity was of less real importance to them\r\n than the total loss of their customary remunerative occupation; that\r\n while the first merely reduced them to want, the latter would make of\r\n them permanent beggars and vagrants, thus doing for their _moral_, all\r\n that the bombardment had done for their _physical_, condition.\r\n\r\n With the somewhat forlorn hope of being able to arrest in a few\r\n individual instances these disastrous consequences, I at once\r\n commenced the system of work-giving, in which occupation you have\r\n found me, and concerning which you have done me the honor to ask some\r\n opinions and recommendations.\r\n\r\n If I might be so bold as to make a single recommendation, in\r\n reference to this unhappy population under their present calamitous\r\n circumstances, it would be that of the most immediate promotion of\r\n honest industry; that at the earliest moment labor be made to walk\r\n hand in hand, and step by step with charity, and, wherever it is\r\n possible, to _precede_ the charity that gives without return; to open\r\n every possible avenue of employment to all classes of individuals,\r\n especially the women and children, in view of the peculiar nature\r\n of the calamities of the present hour which have left so large a\r\n proportion of them without the husband and father of the family upon\r\n whose labor they must have been more or less accustomed to depend in\r\n former times.\r\n\r\n A first step would certainly be the making of garments with which\r\n to keep themselves comfortable and wholesome, and, if I might be\r\n permitted to make a suggestion, it would be that strong, but cheap,\r\n colored material, either of wool or cotton, suitable for dresses,\r\n skirts, and sacques for women and girls, and pantaloons and blouses\r\n for men and boys, be purchased either from manufacturers or merchants\r\n (all of whom are suffering from the effects of the war) and, carefully\r\n fitted and arranged, be given to women to make up in their homes,\r\n after the manner which we have pursued with the thirty or more who are\r\n at present employed from these rooms.\r\n\r\n True, every woman will not sew well at first, but we have found that\r\n nearly every one will learn, and have now no trouble with our workers,\r\n and the garments made by them are good enough to be placed in any\r\n ordinary clothing bazaar for sale.\r\n\r\n The immediate disposition to be made of this clothing when finished\r\n is still an important question. For the _moral_ effect upon those who\r\n are to receive it, I would recommend that it be not given outright\r\n and entire, as this course still has the tendency to foster habits of\r\n beggary and vagrancy which it is so desirable to discourage. Receipt\r\n without return is ever demoralizing, and for this, it were better that\r\n the poor, even, pay _something_ for what they receive, if it be only\r\n a small proportion of the original cost, and with this view, I would\r\n recommend the placing of the articles in a kind of bazaar connected\r\n with and forming a part of the present noble establishment of the\r\n “Comité” of which you are a member, and a price, more or less real,\r\n and more or less nominal, be placed upon them, such a price as will\r\n bring them within the reach of all excepting the most abject, who are\r\n forever, perhaps, to be treated after the ordinary modes of wholesale\r\n charity; but the effort should be always to reduce this class as much\r\n as possible, by lifting up out of it every family and individual that\r\n kindly encouragement, paid labor, and reasonable prices can elevate\r\n above it. One would soon find that a small sale room of this kind\r\n would not necessarily be confined to the few varieties which I have\r\n named, but shoes, stockings, and many articles of ordinary apparel,\r\n and perhaps, also, many articles useful in the family household would\r\n find their way into it, and thus, through the generous and protecting\r\n hands of the Comité, substantial aid and a first impetus be given to\r\n many a small but worthy and unfortunate artisan of your city who now\r\n finds no purchasers for his products, or no material to commence his\r\n work, and to the smaller merchants who find now no purchasers for\r\n their goods.\r\n\r\n I would not have it supposed that I present this little idea as a\r\n permanent _cure_ for existing ills, but as a momentary help in time of\r\n trouble until the hard season passes, and business has time to resume\r\n a little its ordinary course.\r\n\r\n Care would have to be taken to guard against imposition, to see that\r\n persons did not buy to sell again. The same vigilance which is now\r\n exercised in regard to those demanding _charity_ would be necessary\r\n here. One may _beg_ to sell, as well as _buy_ to sell. But it should\r\n not discourage the work that it is liable to abuse. _God’s_ best\r\n gifts to man are hourly abused; shall we expect more for ours?\r\n\r\n All articles would not find purchasers, it may be said. True, but\r\n what remains in hand will constitute the supply to be given in direct\r\n charity, and it is presumed that there will always remain a demand\r\n in this quarter equal to the supply, even under the best systems of\r\n distributive and protected labor.\r\n\r\n It may be asked if this system will not operate against the merchants\r\n who deal in ready-made clothing. It should not in the least, as these\r\n people could never purchase a garment at full price and consequently\r\n could not become their customers.\r\n\r\n In order that my suggestions should not seem merely theoretical,\r\n permit me to turn for a moment to the more practical details. It may\r\n be asked if garments can be made to fit women and girls without actual\r\n measurement? I would reply that, with a graduated scale of five or\r\n six sizes, we have found no more difficulty in fitting women than the\r\n tailor finds in fitting men and boys without actual measurement.\r\n\r\n Again, will there not be much waste of material in cutting quantities\r\n of garments? Very little; literally none; in the graduated sizes, one\r\n garment cuts from the form left by the other, down to the smallest\r\n size, and of the pieces too small for these we have the custom of\r\n making caps for boys and mittens for the hands, so that no piece\r\n larger than the size of a child’s hand need be left unused.\r\n\r\n It would be proper to mention among materials to be purchased the\r\n small articles necessary in the making-up of garments, such as thread,\r\n laces, buttons, agraffes, tapes, etc., etc., the sale of which would\r\n still benefit another class of small merchants.\r\n\r\n I may have dwelt too strongly and too long upon the subject of putting\r\n a price upon charities, but if so, I can only ask to be excused upon\r\n the ground of the moral elevation I so ardently desire for the unhappy\r\n people of your city, and remind you that it is a simple thing to\r\n leave this idea untouched, as the giving of work by no means depends\r\n upon it, and this course alone pursued after the ordinary methods of\r\n charity will of itself place the name of the “Comité of Strassburg”\r\n high upon the roll of the active charitable institutions of the world.\r\n\r\n With sentiments of the highest consideration both for yourself and\r\n your Honorable Comité, I remain, dear sir,\r\n\r\n  Very truly yours\r\n  CLARA BARTON\r\n  STRASSBURG, January 3d, 1871\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this time there were organized American agencies for the relief\r\nof suffering caused by the war. Clara Barton endeavored to establish\r\nrelationships with one of these at Brussels or Antwerp, but without\r\nconspicuous success, as shown by her letter to General Burnside:\r\n\r\n  GENERAL BURNSIDE\r\n  MY ESTEEMED GENERAL:\r\n\r\n I am sure that a word will suffice to remind you of our interview at\r\n Geneva, and its object; and perhaps you will recollect that I craved\r\n the privilege of personal introduction from you to the American\r\n Legation at Brussels where it seemed proper to locate the headquarters\r\n of the American organization for the relief of the French peasantry\r\n which I had then traveled half the length of Germany and the width of\r\n Switzerland in the rain and snows to effect. I saw then so clearly all\r\n which has since transpired that I could not repress the conscientious\r\n demand of duty to use every effort within my power to prepare for the\r\n safe receipt and faithful and wise distribution of the forthcoming\r\n gifts of our countrymen, although at that moment no societies assisted\r\n and no monies had been raised in America to my knowledge except by the\r\n French and Germans residing there. I had, like yourself, come fresh\r\n from the scenes of strife, want, and desolation, and was chilled and\r\n bewildered by the cool indifference of the Americans residing here\r\n to whom I referred in such warmth of confidence. Only yourself, of\r\n all I met, gave a word of hearty approval. You will remember as I was\r\n surrounded that I could not tell you this at that moment; neither had\r\n I words to tell you how grateful I was for your commendation of my\r\n plans. Even the names of those who knew me well were withheld from\r\n me, as it seemed to me to be exceedingly moderate and modest, proper,\r\n hesitating and haggling until after you had given yours; then they\r\n came, so much weak men need a leader. Then I hurried back to my post\r\n of duty at Strassburg, and on to Brussels, still in the rain, to be\r\n there on the “fifth day,” hoping to find and through you gain the more\r\n willing aid of the American representation there, and found something\r\n like American headquarters either there or at Antwerp; but to my\r\n excessive regret you had already passed out of town as I came in, and\r\n I stood alone in that strange city with my heavy, unfinished task. I\r\n called upon General Shetland, who very properly recommended me to his\r\n superior. I called upon him. He met me sharply and unkindly; informed\r\n me in a needlessly rude manner that he never heard of me before, and\r\n couldn’t understand what I wanted; that he saw no names on my paper\r\n which justified him in placing his there, and he should not do it. Of\r\n course I left his presence without a word. Genial General Shetland was\r\n hurt and offered his name “if it would do any good,” but I could not\r\n suffer him to place himself in unpleasant relations with his superior\r\n and declined it.\r\n\r\n Still in the storm and mud, defeated and discouraged, sore and weak,\r\n I left Brussels and made Metz, which had that day opened its hungry\r\n gates. After a few hard days’ work among its famishing, fevered\r\n population I came once more to my work in Strassburg. I now saw\r\n clearly that I could effect nothing in the way of an organization to\r\n aid the work of our countrymen when they should see fit to commence\r\n it. I was grieved for the loss, through this account, to the suffering\r\n French and the loss of satisfaction to our countrymen eventually when\r\n the wiser ones should come to realize that they had _not_ done their\r\n _own work_ in _their own_ name and manner, and with the best results.\r\n But I was only one woman alone, and had no power to move to action\r\n full-fed, sleek-coated, ease-loving, pleasure-seeking, well-paid, and\r\n well-placed countrymen in this war-trampled, dead, old land, each one\r\n afraid that he should be called upon to do something.\r\n\r\nOn June 1 Miss Barton left her well-organized work in Strassburg and\r\nhastened to Paris, where she spent about six weeks in the relief\r\nof suffering and distress. From there she went to Lyons, where she\r\nestablished another workroom such as she had had in Strassburg.\r\nSomething of the detail of her work in Paris is afforded us in a brief\r\nletter to a gentleman in London, acknowledging a gift of five hundred\r\npounds sterling for her work. We see something of the grim situation\r\nwhich she confronted in that city. A much more cheerful letter is one\r\nwhich she wrote to Annie Childs just as she was about to leave Lyons\r\nat the end of August. Annie had been her dressmaker for many years.\r\nThis letter, informing Annie that she was now the head of a dressmaking\r\nestablishment of her own, shows how fully at this time she seemed to\r\nhave recovered her old vivacity, and to be, amidst the desolation of a\r\nconquered country, her own wholesome, self-reliant self:\r\n\r\n  LYONS, FRANCE, August 20, 1871\r\n  MY DEAR ANNIE:\r\n\r\n If I were to make an apology as long as my offense, I could write\r\n nothing else, but I don’t like apologies; you don’t either, do you?\r\n Then let me hasten to proclaim myself an idle, lazy, procrastinating,\r\n miserable do-nothing and good-for-nothing; if that isn’t enough, I\r\n leave the sentence open for you to finish and I sign it squarely when\r\n you have done and call it “quits.” But really it _has_ been too bad. I\r\n have neglected everybody in general, not you in particular. I thought\r\n I was too busy to write. I don’t suppose I was, only that I did not\r\n employ my time well. _I know_ this is often so and perhaps always. I\r\n wish I had been better educated in this regard as well as every other.\r\n If you are ever married, as you doubtless will be, and have a family\r\n of eight or ten children, I beg you will make it a specialty in their\r\n several educations that they be taught to do things in the proper\r\n time. You will do me a favor to remember this as one of “my efforts\r\n for the good of humanity.”\r\n\r\n [Illustration: [_Facsimile_]]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: PRINCE BISMARCK’S LETTER]\r\n\r\n I wanted all last winter to tell you about my “dressmaking” and\r\n describe to you my “shop.” I knew it would interest you if no one\r\n else. Now, wasn’t that the last thing you would have thought of,\r\n that I should come to Europe and set up _dressmaking_, and _French_\r\n dressmaking at that? I knew the fact would be a little surprise to\r\n most of my old friends who knew me best, but to you I imagine it a\r\n matter of bewildering astonishment. Well, you should have seen\r\n the patterns! “Did I have patterns?” Didn’t I? And didn’t I cut them\r\n myself? And didn’t I direct all the making until I had imparted my\r\n wonderful art to others? And _you_ think my garments were fearfully\r\n and wonderfully made! Well, that opinion comes of your being an\r\n _old_ maid and so particular. I assure you, Miss Annie Childs, that\r\n they were nice garments and prettily cut and well made, and I found\r\n them in excellent demand; every one wanted them and never a word of\r\n _complaint of the price_; everybody seemed to be perfectly convinced\r\n that they were cheap enough at my first offer. I had ten young girls\r\n (like yours) dressmakers, and from one to three men “tailors” who\r\n worked twelve hours a day, but only with the shears, never an hour’s\r\n sewing; and no one sewed at my “shop”; only those who must be taught\r\n to take something out and do it over. And we made dresses and sacques\r\n and petticoats and chemises and aprons and hoods and mittens and\r\n pantaloons, vests, blouses, shirts, socks, of all kinds of material\r\n and all sizes that ever the tiniest baby grew to. Oh, yes, and such\r\n lots of things for babies,--little dresses, little bonnets, cloaks,\r\n blankets, two thousand garments every week. I don’t think they\r\n were gored and flounced and frilled as much as yours, Miss Annie\r\n Childs, but they were strong and warm and handsome. It is true all\r\n my seamstresses had not such nimble, delicate fingers as one might\r\n desire for the finest work; they wore very large thimbles sometimes;\r\n but there were plenty of small fingers in the family. They came very\r\n gladly twice a week to see me and showed me with great pride their\r\n successful efforts; always the work came home in the market basket,\r\n and always I knew that that same basket would load the other way\r\n with bread and a little meat if it were possible, but this was not\r\n always. But it was such a comfort to see them, week by week, grow\r\n better clothed themselves and the children, till by and by a woman\r\n and her baby came to look only like a big and a little bundle of the\r\n same clothing she carried in her basket. And all the working-people\r\n of the city came to look like walking bundles of the same clothing.\r\n To be sure, it took away something from the picturesque style of the\r\n city as I first saw it when at least ten thousand human beings were\r\n perfectly arranged for models for the painter and the sculptor. I\r\n admit that it was highly artistic, but I thought it a “_peutrop_” for\r\n the season, considering that the earliest snows had commenced to fall.\r\n Oh, but don’t you wish now that you had come and worked at the head of\r\n my “shop”--didn’t _I_ wish it? More than once I sighed in my inmost\r\n soul for you. How rich I should have been, with you at my side! Just\r\n think of it! I shall write to Fannie sometime when I hain’t told all\r\n the news to you--please hand her this if she looks patient and strong\r\n enough to stand it.\r\n\r\n How much I wonder what you are all doing at home! I seem entirely to\r\n have lost the thread, and from the stray little thrums which I get\r\n hold of I cannot pick it up. I am just now in despair about Sally.\r\n Some one writes me that they suppose I know all about her and Vester’s\r\n _sickness_! Imagine the effect of this piece of intelligence. Another\r\n says, it was fortunate they were with Ber and Fannie, as they were\r\n sure of good care!!! This is consoling. What did they have, and how\r\n did they get it, and how was it, and when was it, and how is it now?\r\n Do pray you write and tell me. I am distressed and can’t at all help\r\n myself. I do hope they have not had a serious illness, but I keep\r\n feeling all the time that _somebody_ will be sick. I keep writing\r\n Sally at Washington, but have no idea where she is and where you are\r\n this hot summer, and Fannie, poor, dear, neglected Fannie. She ought\r\n to cross me off her books, and I guess she has before this time. I\r\n know there has never been a day since I left that the entire troop of\r\n you all has not passed in panorama before me, and I have attempted to\r\n place you all as I thought it most likely to be, but I suppose I have\r\n been wide of the mark.\r\n\r\n For me, as you must have known a hundred times when I left Strassburg,\r\n I went to Paris, and, after six weeks there distributing clothing\r\n and money, I left and came to Lyons to visit a family of one of the\r\n younger ladies who had aided me twice since the war commenced, and\r\n I have remained here about as long as I was in Paris, but am ready\r\n to leave, and shall again this week go to Paris for a day or two to\r\n meet some parties of Americans who will be there on their way home,\r\n and from there I am to go, as I have been once, into the central\r\n eastern portion of France to see the places and peoples who have been\r\n much destroyed by the war and the sieges. I have no idea how much\r\n time I shall consume here. I must judge this by the condition I find\r\n the people in. I am almost tired of France and long for Germany or\r\n something which is solid and Saxon. There is no truth, no fixedness\r\n of purpose, nothing reliable, nothing sensible in France, and it only\r\n disgusts me that they have always claimed the leadership of the world\r\n and that so stupidly it has been conceded to them. I do hope the\r\n German bayonets have punched a hole in that bubble large enough to\r\n burst it. It is certainly time. If they were even neat, I would not\r\n complain so much of them, but they are such a dirty race of people,\r\n dirty but fashionable. One gets tired of this. Now, you will see from\r\n this that it is a real merit in me to work for the French. I do it out\r\n of pity and charity toward suffering humanity, because they need, and\r\n not because I gratify my love or my taste by it. I do neither. I think\r\n it right to do or I would not touch it, I do assure you.\r\n\r\n Now, there are so many people whom you see every day that I would be\r\n so glad to see that it makes me almost homesick to write you. Does\r\n Willis still remain in Oxford, and Uncle John and Nancy; how are they?\r\n And Mrs. Hannah Sanford and Mrs. Sigourney, and all my cousins in\r\n Worcester; do you see them? Cousin Lydia Grout, do you see her ever?\r\n The Bacons and Starrs and Cousin Maria? I am told that Cousin Ned is\r\n to be married, and then my Cousin Jerry, what of him, and the Dennys\r\n and Dr. Snow? If you see him, please remember me most kindly. And the\r\n Towers and Mr. and Mrs. T. W. Hammond. Don’t you see I am homesick to\r\n see all these people even if they have forgotten me? I cannot help\r\n it. I am sure you will write me a long letter full of news, just as\r\n is your specialty, for, Annie Childs, you know, you _do_ know, how to\r\n write a letter, and I shall wait for it now till it comes. You will\r\n address me as usual care of American Legation, Berne, Switzerland.\r\n\r\n How does Ber behave? Does he boss his wife any? If he does, you pull\r\n his ears for me, and oblige\r\n\r\n  Yoors trooly, and believe me, your lovingest Sis\r\n  CLARA BARTON\r\n\r\n\r\n  BENJAMIN MORAN, ESQ.\r\n  Chargé d’Affaires, London\r\n\r\n  ESTEEMED SIR:\r\n\r\n While I acknowledge the receipt of your favor and enclosed cheque\r\n for five hundred pounds, permit me, in the name of the suffering of\r\n France, to thank you and your Committee most earnestly for the same.\r\n Your generous gift will enable me to send comfort into hundreds of\r\n desolate and more distraught families, whom I have hitherto been\r\n unable to reach. I beg you will permit me to explain that my attempts\r\n to clothe the people of France have not been the result of a desire to\r\n improve the personal appearance, but to aid in ridding them a little,\r\n if possible, from the scourge of pestilence and vermin which the war\r\n has so terribly spread among them.\r\n\r\n It is to be hoped that few will die of outright hunger during the next\r\n six months, but thousands must fall pitiful victims to disease lurking\r\n in the only old rags, in which months ago they escaped from fire and\r\n destruction. Disease is spread from one family to another, until\r\n thousands who are well to-day will rot with smallpox and be devoured\r\n by body lice before the end of August. Against the progress of these\r\n two scourges there is, I believe, no check but the destruction of all\r\n infected garments; hence the imperative necessity for something to\r\n take their place. Excuse, sir, I pray you, the plain, ugly terms which\r\n I have employed to express myself; the facts are plain and ugly.\r\n\r\nHow industrious she was in Paris and how bravely and cheerfully she did\r\nher work is shown by two home letters which she sent out simultaneously\r\nin September, one to her sister Sally and the other to Mrs. Bernard\r\nVassall, her long-time friend, Fannie Childs Vassall:\r\n\r\n  PARIS, Sept. 18, 1871\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR FANNIE:\r\n\r\n I have forgotten if I really did send a line in Annie’s letter or\r\n not. I know I wanted to, but since that I have received that precious\r\n “gingerbread” letter from all the family, and I have read and re-read,\r\n and spied into little corners to see some other welcome face peeping\r\n out. It was so good of Willis and Ber to set their hands and seals.\r\n Yes, I know all about receiving letters that call directly upon my\r\n heart, and my desire to answer that hour, and a thousand times I have\r\n said that _those_ were the very letters which were to lie longest\r\n in neglect and likely enough never get answered at all. The fact is\r\n I am over-anxious about them, and wait for a few moments of better\r\n opportunity, feeling that I have much to say, and so I wait and\r\n wait, _and these_ letters are the sore spot, the worrying sin of my\r\n existence, _that_ little package which I cannot put by, but which lies\r\n around, and looks me in the face on the most impossible of occasions,\r\n and reproaches in silence, and comes late at night and early in the\r\n morning to haunt, it may be to taunt, me a little; _that_ little\r\n package is the plague of my life, and yet I prize it most of all and\r\n couldn’t have done without it, but I can never quite dispose of it.\r\n Oh, yes, yes, I do understand all you try so patiently to explain to\r\n me, ONLY that I don’t think my poor scrap could ever have been one\r\n of the class of letter which burden me, for I have no recollection\r\n whatever of it, and seriously suspect it was only a little pile of\r\n trash. It has been brave of you not to get sick in all summer with\r\n all your work, and company and sickness besides, but I am so glad\r\n that Sally was with you, and I suppose Vester was also, but it is not\r\n mentioned where he was during his illness.\r\n\r\n I am spending some fine days in Paris, just what I most desired.\r\n I wanted to see some American people; it had been so long since I\r\n had seen them--and indeed there is no lack of them here. All Paris\r\n swarms with them, as I suppose it always does, and all grades. Some\r\n I am proud of, and some I am ashamed of; some speak remarkably well,\r\n and some cannot utter a proper sentence. Generally they are “well\r\n dressed,” as the world goes, but to my eye “over-rigged,” as a sailor\r\n would say, but always much better than the English, who are the most\r\n fearful dressers in all Christendom. English women are solid and\r\n sensible, learned and self-possessed, and all the world respects\r\n them; but the art of selecting and putting clothes onto themselves\r\n is something quite beyond their line of vision. Not that they do not\r\n wear enough,--oh, Heavens, no, not that,--there is always enough and\r\n to spare, but there is no calculation what portion or member of the\r\n body corporate it will be found dangling from, and Joseph’s coat bore\r\n no comparison. Still they are splendid women, and handsome, fifty\r\n per cent more beautiful than the French. The French declare that the\r\n Germans cannot dress in decent manner, but I have seen much good,\r\n comfortable-looking dressing in Germany, and I rather liked it. I\r\n don’t know _what_ has induced me to write so much upon the silly\r\n matter of dress, unless that some of my “sisterin” abroad annoy me a\r\n little with theirs.\r\n\r\n I can see how busy Ber must be with his large family and congratulate\r\n both him and his children upon the relationship. I imagine him to be\r\n the most sensible and paternal of parents. I shall be only too glad\r\n when you can really take your legitimate place in the work. I can see\r\n an equal call for your services. Go and look after the _little girls_.\r\n They may not like to tell all their troubles to their State Papa, but\r\n would rejoice to reveal some things to a mamma. Go with Ber. I think\r\n that is one of your “rights”--it is at least your privilege, and you\r\n know it is very well said that “until women get their _rights_, they\r\n must keep their _privileges_.” I also have something of a family in\r\n Europe, _some_ hundreds of state children, but of my own _immediate_\r\n family I have two delightful girls. They are as fully grown and\r\n developed as my two boys in America were, rather more, and _about as\r\n near alike_, but charming girls, both good as they can be, and be\r\n human, live girls. One is all gentleness, the other all strength, but\r\n both are so loving, so obedient, so true. The elder is Miss Antoinette\r\n Margot. She is a thorough artist, and is with me at present, painting\r\n and visiting the Louvre and the Luxembourg and comparing notes with\r\n the Parisian painters. She is at this moment painting an American\r\n flag, and looking back over her shoulder to ask me, “How many of the\r\n red stripes must commence at the field?” and ends with “Mais il est\r\n très joli.” Miss Anna Zimmermann is at her home in Carlsruhe looking\r\n after the thousand wants of a clergyman’s house, keeping the big\r\n brothers in order for the Universities they are plodding through;\r\n obeying her papa and mamma, who tell her she is too “independent and\r\n ambitious,” writing at odd moments as she can pick them, reading\r\n Carlyle, Dickens, Goethe, Schiller, as she can steal the minutes,\r\n pining that she must be held in just such bondage of body and soul,\r\n praying for the day when she may come and live with me a little more,\r\n and beginning a long, strong, logical letter once in a while with\r\n “To the Devil with the housework! Why must I fritter away all the\r\n best years of my own life and starve my brain to cram my brothers who\r\n already have been taught twenty times more than they can apply?” And\r\n she is right.\r\n\r\n But my sheet will be full and I shall have said nothing at all. I\r\n have just written your “Marm” and I think, perhaps, that will find its\r\n way to you, and you must just have had a surfeit through Annie. I am\r\n glad she went for a vacation. I wonder what they do at Falmouth. When\r\n I am home, can’t we go? I am not at all certain where I shall pass the\r\n winter; it may be I shall think I must work in France. I cannot tell\r\n how they will present themselves by winter, or I may think it well to\r\n quarter myself here in Paris and wait; and I have half a mind to go to\r\n Spain. This is perhaps the most sensible use I could make of the time.\r\n I must wait a little the turning of events. I can tell better after a\r\n month more in the east of France. I am glad you have had a visit from\r\n Georgie. It was nice of her to send me a line. Is not Alice with you\r\n now? Has she turned to ashes?--very possible--human nature can as well\r\n as wood or coal. Write me when you have time and don’t let Ber abuse\r\n you.\r\n\r\n  Yours      CLARA\r\n\r\n  To Ber--\r\n  I am first-rate, how are you?      CLARA\r\n  For particulars see within.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the terror and bloodshed of the Paris Commune, Miss Barton spent\r\nsome time in northern France, laboring as she had labored in Paris and\r\nin Lyons; at Belfort, where she finished her work on October 27, and\r\nwent for a little time of rest to Carlsruhe, where she was the guest\r\nof the Reverend Mr. Zimmermann, whose daughter had labored with her at\r\nStrassburg. Antoinette Margot was there also, glad to turn from scenes\r\nof desolation to her work of painting.\r\n\r\nThe middle of December she went forth again in bitter cold weather,\r\naccompanied by Antoinette Margot, distributing relief to the poor at\r\nMülhausen, Belfort, and Montbéliard. She spent Christmas at Strassburg,\r\nwhere she served a great Christmas dinner to some five hundred of her\r\nold acquaintances, and then returned to Carlsruhe.\r\n\r\nActivity agreed with Clara Barton. She rose to meet great emergencies.\r\nWhen the crisis was passed, she felt the effect of so long a strain.\r\nAgain and again during her lifetime she carried an enterprise\r\ncompletely through to the triumphant close, and when it was done\r\ncollapsed from nervous overstrain. Twice in America that collapse had\r\nbeen indicated by the total failure of her voice. At the close of the\r\nFranco-Prussian War she collapsed again. This time it was not her\r\nvoice, but her eyesight. Her eyes were inflamed by the strain and smoke\r\nof the battle-fields. The nervous tension aggravated the discomfort of\r\nwhich the inflamed eyes were, after all, only a symptom. For several\r\nmonths in the winter and spring of 1872 she was at Carlsruhe in a state\r\nof semi-blindness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [_Facsimile_]\r\n\r\nSTRASSBURG DIPLOMA OF HONOR]\r\n\r\nWe have a little sidelight on Clara Barton’s work among the French\r\nwomen in an undated letter from Belfort, almost certainly by Antoinette\r\nMargot. An American woman in Paris had evidently asked her for some\r\naccount of the work of Clara Barton, and she had promised to write it.\r\nThe letter gives some intimate glimpses into the character of her work:\r\n\r\n  [October, 1871]\r\n  DEAR MADAM:\r\n\r\n Faithful to the promise made to you one bright day in Paris more\r\n than two months ago, I write. You remember that it was a kind of\r\n clandestine pledge, made in low tones, that I would one time tell you\r\n something of the doings of your compatriot, who has the “singular\r\n habit, _for a woman_,” as the world would say, of doing something and\r\n saying nothing.\r\n\r\n From much observation, I am convinced that Clara Barton never makes\r\n the least report of what she does, unless, for some cause, she\r\n considers it to be absolutely indispensable, and then, in a form so\r\n plain and business-like that one would read, and turn the paper,\r\n little dreaming of all the sentiment, strength, heart, poetry, and\r\n labor that lay hidden beneath that unpretending exterior.\r\n\r\n It were too long to tell you of the few weeks in Paris, following\r\n your departure. What, between the sympathies for the families of the\r\n wretched prisoners of Versailles, and the outpouring Alsatians who\r\n refuse to remain German, there was little rest for body or soul. Some\r\n entire families had even followed from Strassburg, knowing that Miss\r\n Barton went from there to Paris, and certain of relief if they should\r\n find her there. They did find her, and now occupy good positions. One\r\n is even placed for life in the civil service of the French Government\r\n (if the Government shall last so long). But these things, done through\r\n rain and storm, cost strength, and I was near to report to you a sick\r\n list.\r\n\r\n Happily, that is past, and my present hour must be applied to telling\r\n you of Miss Barton’s work in a third general point of desolate France,\r\n viz., the brave little town of Belfort, which has rendered its name\r\n illustrious by the heroism of its defense. Here we are, facing the\r\n high citadel and the famous cannon “Catharine” that twenty-five\r\n thousand German bombs could not silence, and here day after day works\r\n your countrywoman trying to overcome the greatest amount of misery\r\n possible among so many.\r\n\r\n The room in which she received her people has been tendered by\r\n Monsieur l’Administrateur of the town, and is in his own mansion, and\r\n himself and family are proving at every moment to your noble sister\r\n how proud they are of having obtained this favor.\r\n\r\n It is in this room that she stands from morning till night, smiling\r\n and graceful as always, receiving family after family, and endeavoring\r\n to learn by herself what are their circumstances, how deeply they have\r\n suffered, to express to them her sympathy, and assist them with some\r\n money. It is probable that many of these poor people in this land of\r\n aristocracies have never listened to words so respectfully spoken,\r\n and are often so overcome by this added kindness of manner extended\r\n to them that the first answer which comes is a sob,--often no words\r\n can come,--and trembling, blessing hands held out to her are all that\r\n _can_ speak. But oh! how eloquently they speak!\r\n\r\n They are very poor, these relics of an eight months’ siege. Some,\r\n of course, have lost nothing in material by the war, having nothing\r\n to lose but time and labor, but the larger portion have lost all or\r\n nearly all they possessed, the fruit of forty or fifty years of hard\r\n work, and remain homeless, hopeless, old, broken, dispirited, sick\r\n since they have lived in cellars, and without the smallest prospect of\r\n regaining their lost property. Do wars in Republics leave the people\r\n as badly off, I wonder?\r\n\r\n It is not a rare thing to see a poor woman come in with her garland\r\n of six, seven, or eight handsome young children which she presents\r\n with both pride and distress. One had even thirteen, and when asked\r\n if all of them were still in her charge, she exclaimed, with the most\r\n charming simplicity, “Oh! _no_, madame, _two_ are abroad; I have only\r\n _eleven_ to work for.”\r\n\r\n To-day, a tall, thinly clad woman entered, and presented her billet,\r\n bearing the stamp of the mayor. “Have you children?” asked Miss Barton\r\n kindly, as she took it. “Have I children?” exclaimed the woman in a\r\n tone at once proud and pitiful. “_Dear_ child, if I haven’t. I have\r\n ten.” Miss Barton turned away to her table, but a stolen glance at\r\n her face a moment after detected something there glistening brighter\r\n than the gold she dropped into that hard, dark hand. “Ah,” thought I,\r\n as I hastened down the name as rapidly as possible,--“Ah, if only all\r\n the world’s work were done with a little of the heart in it how much\r\n nearer Heaven would seem!”\r\n\r\n When it was decided that Miss Barton would accept the labor of herself\r\n receiving the crowd of victims of the bombardment, the authorities of\r\n the town, fearing for her, from the roughness of these people, who,\r\n they said, would rush in all together, by all the doors and windows,\r\n placed four policemen around the house to protect her against the\r\n crowd. Two of them in turn have for their mission to open the only\r\n door by which the solicitors are admitted. But never was I so amused\r\n as to see Miss Barton _protecting her policemen_, and preventing these\r\n rough men and shrill-toned women from crowding them against the wall.\r\n When sometimes they are all in a quarrel, the policemen swearing like\r\n two thunders according to the approved French manner of preserving\r\n respect, she appears at the door, and in the most charming manner\r\n prays them to wait a little and be quiet. Then the most piercing\r\n voices become silent, the wildest men are ashamed of their noise. The\r\n only visible motions are those nearest trying to hide themselves\r\n behind others, and those in the distance raising themselves on tiptoe\r\n to see “la bonne dame américaine.” As for the policemen, they are\r\n perfectly puzzled, and could never have supposed that so gentle a\r\n lady, who never scolds or swears, could hold in order so undisciplined\r\n a crowd.\r\n\r\n Often the work is interrupted for more agreeable reasons. Once it is\r\n a deputation of the sisters of the civil hospital, in their snowy\r\n bonnets, or some other charitable institutions of the town who want to\r\n thank her for the gifts sent to their establishment. Another day it\r\n is the mayor of the town, who desires to pay respects; another time\r\n all the council, mercifully asking to be allowed to express to her\r\n their gratitude in the name of Belfort and the county. All this as a\r\n personal matter I hear always steadily repelled, and they are politely\r\n requested to bear in mind that it is America and the goodly city of\r\n Boston to whom, if to any, all thanks are due. But no one is so mad as\r\n to expect to outdo a Frenchman in official politeness, and I observed\r\n the president of the council, half bent, hat in hand, replying that\r\n their three names would be always so united in their hearts that they\r\n should never be able to hear the one without thinking of the others.\r\n\r\n This is a region almost exclusively Catholic, and the ignorance of\r\n the people is something deplorable. Each recipient is asked for a\r\n signature, and the proportion who are able to make something beyond an\r\n X is less than one in fifteen. Writing is an accomplishment generally\r\n not to be thought of, especially by the women, but when one who has\r\n attained so far is asked if she can give her signature, she replies,\r\n with the assuming grace of a noble of the blood, “Certainement,\r\n pourquoi pas?” But the common response is a burst of astonishment at\r\n the bare supposition. “I write! Mon Dieu, how should I.” A difficulty,\r\n by no means the smallest, is to find the kind of money to which these\r\n poor people have been accustomed. The immense payments of France to\r\n Germany all in silver and gold are fast making _coin_ among the things\r\n that were. The bank-notes of France never having been small in value,\r\n and used rather as a convenience for business than as a currency for\r\n the people, the poor are mostly strangers to it, and when a note was\r\n placed in their hands they waited, holding it a long time, and then\r\n ventured to inquire timidly, if that was something that they could\r\n get some money for, and where they should go to get it changed, and\r\n how they should do it? It was useless to tell them its value; they\r\n would have preferred ten francs in silver to twenty in paper. And,\r\n indeed, as they could not read, it were perhaps better for them, as\r\n one saw at once that they would be at the mercy of every swindler they\r\n met. This would not do. All notes which had been given were recalled\r\n and redeemed in coin, and it is certainly the occupation of one man\r\n from morning till night to change paper into coin as fast as it is\r\n required for distribution.\r\n\r\n But it is impossible; the night is not long enough to tell all that\r\n transpires during the day, and one must not attempt it. I only wish,\r\n as I always do, that her own people could see their countrywoman at\r\n work among European poor, as not one European has done. If they are\r\n proud of her for what she has done at home, they would be prouder of\r\n her in a tenfold greater degree for what she is doing abroad, never at\r\n the best strength, in a strange country of foreign customs and divers\r\n tongues.\r\n\r\n _Pardon, s’il vous plaît_, my miserable English; you knew what it was\r\n when you gave me leave to write you, and I can only thank you for the\r\n kind indulgence.\r\n\r\n  Yours in sincerity\r\n  A.\r\n\r\n\r\nAntoinette was not quite correct, however, concerning Clara Barton’s\r\nreports. She made rather full reports to the organizations that\r\nsupplied her with funds. To Mr. Edmund Dwight, chairman of the Boston\r\nCommittee, under whose auspices she labored during the latter part of\r\nher time in France, she wrote an extended letter, outlining in full her\r\nmethod of work, and shows how sensibly and wisely she did all her work:\r\n\r\n  CHÂTEAU DE BELFORT\r\n  BELFORT, Oct. 28, 1871\r\n\r\n  DEAR MR. DWIGHT:\r\n\r\n Sitting down to write you after one of the hardest day’s work one\r\n might ever hope to find, you will not wonder if I am not dazzlingly\r\n brilliant.\r\n\r\n I should not select so inauspicious a moment but that I find your\r\n letter has been waiting so long without getting to me, and that I\r\n cannot rest until I have at least commenced a reply, even if I am not\r\n able to finish it to-night. It had been stayed by my own orders. My\r\n letters in France for a time went wrongly and some were lost, both for\r\n and from me, for which the postal authorities are now busy searching,\r\n and as the losing of letters is one of the things I cannot endure, I\r\n ordered mine to be held at all points where they would arrive, until\r\n I could arrange some safe place of reception. They have come to me at\r\n Belfort, and I find yours which has waited a month.\r\n\r\n I should have written upon leaving Paris in July if I had not thought\r\n every day that I might get a line from either you or Mr. Moran,\r\n telling me of the delivery or receipt of my large package of accounts,\r\n from which I might draw some inference if my manner of doing things\r\n were an acceptable one. After this, I grew so busy that I think I\r\n forgot all but my work, or rather did not realize the length of time,\r\n as it passed so quickly.\r\n\r\n You ask for my views. They have been so many and so varied that it\r\n would be impossible to tell them at one sitting, but I may say that my\r\n sympathy and judgment have pointed, and my efforts been directed, to\r\n three classes of sufferers, with two of which I have nearly finished,\r\n and the third I am at this moment among with heart and hand.\r\n\r\n 1. These were, the families of the prisoners of Versailles, and the\r\n ships of the Manche.\r\n\r\n 2. The families of Alsace and Lorraine, who, refusing to become\r\n German, are passing over the lines into France by hundreds, even\r\n thousands.\r\n\r\n 3. And thirdly, the region of Belfort.\r\n\r\n The first-named of these are no longer confined to Paris, but are\r\n scattered now, for some distance around, poor, suffering, frightened,\r\n and trebly desolate.\r\n\r\n First, they have often lost the family support in the person of the\r\n prisoner; next, they wait in suspense worse than actual death for the\r\n result of the impending trial, and fearing often to reveal to those\r\n about them who they are, and why they are so destitute; and lastly,\r\n poor as they are, they know that the Government allows but fifty\r\n centimes a day for the use of each prisoner, and provides nothing\r\n else, not even a bed, only straw, and whatever more he has (and many\r\n are very ill) must be provided by the friends from outside. You will\r\n see how the hungry mouths and wretched homes would be robbed by pity\r\n and anxiety to supply this necessity.\r\n\r\n I have made it a portion of my care to find and supply some of these\r\n families; it can only be _some_, for there cannot be less than twenty\r\n thousand of them. There are forty thousand prisoners.\r\n\r\n The next in order, and a still more wretched class, if possible,\r\n so far as extreme _homelessness_ and _nothingness_ can go, are\r\n the outcoming Alsatians. The time has arrived for each to decide\r\n individually which to become, and remaining to take the oath of\r\n allegiance to Germany. In their ignorance and infatuation, they still\r\n believe France to be the greatest nation of the earth, and, in spite\r\n of her recent reverses, watch with unflinching faith to see her, at no\r\n distant day, rise in all her old-time power and glory, and advance in\r\n majesty to take back her lost possessions; and to them the thought is\r\n death, that, in that proud day, second only to the Resurrection, they\r\n and their sons must bend their necks to the Prussian helmet, and point\r\n their guns against the Eagles of France. Impudent expressions touching\r\n these points bring them into unpleasant relations with the German\r\n soldiery still stationed among them, who probably do not hesitate to\r\n mention unwelcome and unpalatable facts. This “last feather” is too\r\n much, and, finding the burden too heavy to be borne, the incensed\r\n father, or, too often, the widowed mother, gathers up the family of\r\n growing children, and, turning the back upon the blackened walls and\r\n trampled fields of the old home, makes the nearest point of the French\r\n lines and comes out defiant, with never a penny or a morsel. The\r\n French are glad to receive them, feel complimented by their loyalty,\r\n but are burdened and embarrassed by them. Societies for their relief\r\n are formed at many points, but it is only the merest trifle they can\r\n do for them, excepting to aid in finding employment. This often takes\r\n a long time, and the interim of waiting is something fearful. I found\r\n them largely at Lyons, which is one of the points they make on their\r\n way to the South of France, and Algiers. Again I found them at Paris,\r\n where several thousands have come in, every train bringing them,\r\n especially the night trains.\r\n\r\n I have put in practice a lesson here which I learned in Germany\r\n fourteen months ago, when infuriated France drove all her German\r\n families over her lines; viz., to meet and provide for them at\r\n the trains. No one can suppose for a moment that leaving Alsace\r\n and Lorraine and coming into France is not the most unwise and\r\n deplorable step these poor people could take; that they would not be a\r\n hundred-fold better off to remain. But I did not understand that your\r\n mission was to the _wise_, but to the _unhappy_, and I have taken the\r\n liberty to give them something.\r\n\r\n But while occupied with those and these, I had by no means forgotten\r\n Belfort, or the fact that _this_ was to be the great point when\r\n the right time should come. After leaving Paris, I met some very\r\n intelligent and practical gentlemen from that vicinity and learned\r\n of them many facts which have been of use to me, and always a\r\n confirmation of what we had both thought, viz., that help would be\r\n really more serviceable at the commencement of the cold weather than\r\n in midsummer. Their crops were abundant, especially grass. This set\r\n me to confer in Switzerland in reference to _cows_, and from these\r\n inquiries I learned something of a plan most gratifying if it could be\r\n realized, and I waited a little to see. This was in August, at which\r\n time, as you know, nearly all the cattle are on the mountains. On the\r\n 9th of October (“Le jour de la Saint Denis”) they are returned to the\r\n farms! There are then often too many for the winter and they can be\r\n purchased at lower rates. This, then, would be the time to purchase.\r\n But the good idea had entered into the minds of the Swiss to make a\r\n collection of cattle at that time for all the vicinity of Belfort and\r\n Montbéliard, or where the stock had been lost. They could do this\r\n without sending money out of Switzerland, which they desired to avoid,\r\n having already done so much of it. They carried out their plan, and\r\n when the time arrived commenced sending, and are _still_ sending,\r\n to this region nearly as much stock as it is thought they can keep\r\n through the winter.\r\n\r\n When I saw these things likely to succeed, I held a conference with\r\n the authorities of Belfort, and asked them to tell me plainly what\r\n their people most needed. They replied, “Small sums of money to\r\n commence the winter with,” and gave this reason: There is just now\r\n commencing a money panic in France. The large payments she must make\r\n to Germany in gold and silver make these commodities exceedingly\r\n scarce, and all who have a little bury it in their pockets and\r\n bureaus, and hold it against the time when there will be no more and\r\n paper worth little or nothing. The smallest note, as you know, is\r\n twenty francs, a sum beyond the reach of a poor family, and thus there\r\n is nothing for them in _money_. This state of things, they assured\r\n me, would grow worse and worse, and, as France is only at her second\r\n payment (I believe), there was no room to doubt the correctness of\r\n their judgment. I asked how they would have it, in a sum to give to\r\n the people _themselves_, or should _I_ give it? Apologizing for the\r\n labor they were suggesting to me, they begged that I would do it if I\r\n could, not that they were too indolent to do the work (for they are\r\n splendid men, and have the welfare of their people at heart), but they\r\n explained, that, living among and exercising jurisdiction over these\r\n people, who looked to them for impossible things, it was embarrassing\r\n to them to make distributions among them personally. The people were\r\n ignorant, and all had suffered _so much_ that each one believed his\r\n or her case to be the _worst in the world_. And they would be much\r\n better satisfied with something from a stranger, which they would\r\n receive as a _gift_, than with ten times the sum from the municipal\r\n authorities, to whom they looked for “_indemnity_.” They seemed almost\r\n ashamed to ask of me the labor of distribution, and offered all\r\n possible assistance. For the town of Belfort and the nearest villages,\r\n the Administrateur has made the same kind of arrangement as the Mayor\r\n of Villette, and I am at this writing receiving at this house from\r\n fifty to a hundred a day, hearing their story and giving to them the\r\n proportion which seems best suited to their condition.\r\n\r\n I shall go from point to point seeing and aiding _personally_ all\r\n I can or until I am too tired to go farther, and after this, if\r\n something remain unfinished, find the proper persons to do what I have\r\n not done. Montbéliard, Haute Savoie, and Gex will be remembered as\r\n you desired. Indeed, _is_ it necessary for me to say that I shall try\r\n by all means in my power to carry out all suggestions which you have\r\n made? Time and observation have shown them to have been _wise_ and\r\n _good_. I have found nothing better, and only dare hope I may be able\r\n to execute something nearly as well as you designed.\r\n\r\n The money from Baring Bros. I have drawn through Paris, as far as I\r\n thought well in the present state of things, and indeed more of it\r\n than I have found convenient for the manner in which I was desired\r\n to distribute it, and some I must take through Switzerland or Germany\r\n to get the coin which will be useful to these people. The authorities\r\n will aid me in all these things. I have so far rather gained than lost\r\n in all exchanges.\r\n\r\n I believe I have forgotten to speak of my visit to the Prefect of\r\n Doubs, which was one of the most pleasant that could have been. I\r\n found him to be an excellent man (who desired to be remembered to\r\n you with great regard, regretting your illness). He seemed glad and\r\n touched that I had found and regarded the families of Alsace and\r\n Lorraine, and a little surprised that I should have “comprehended\r\n their condition so quickly,” as he expressed it, as they are a rather\r\n new feature in the chapter of French suffering, and he asked that, in\r\n anything I might leave with Besançon, he be allowed to draw one half\r\n of it from the “Comité de Secours” from time to time to aid these\r\n families on their distressing arrivals and passages through the town.\r\n I thank you very much for this pleasant and useful introduction.\r\n\r\n I am unable, my dear friend, at the present moment to report further,\r\n as I am just in the midst of my work; when it is a little over, I will\r\n write again, and as soon as possible I will send you all explanations\r\n and certificates and signatures which have come into my possession,\r\n and tell you as well as I am able what I have done, and how it was\r\n done.\r\n\r\n With the highest esteem\r\n\r\n  I am very truly yours\r\n\r\n  CLARA BARTON\r\n\r\n\r\n I cannot describe how painful and tiresome I find it to work _here_,\r\n abroad, among these strangers, with _every thought and sympathy and\r\n energy_ turning and rushing four thousand miles across the ocean to\r\n our _own beautiful and ill-fated city_,[1] with its hundred thousand\r\n homeless heads. At night I can realize this a little; in the morning\r\n I think I have dreamed a bad dream. The facts will not remain _fixed_\r\n with me.\r\n\r\n A message has been sent from the _Court_ of _Baden_ to say that I am\r\n desired there. This is the third time I have been asked in the last\r\n two months, but was always too busy to go immediately, but now that I\r\n am so near and the message made so direct, I must go. If I can finish\r\n my work first I will; if not, I must leave it a little and return. I\r\n have no idea what is wanted of me. I will send this enclosed to Baring\r\n Bros.\r\n\r\n  Hastily\r\n\r\n  C. B.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis work continued for some time and there came no definite date which\r\ncould be accounted its termination. For this reason and because of the\r\ncondition of her health, the final report was not presented until after\r\nher return to America. Then in a letter to Mr. Dwight, the chairman,\r\nand Mr. Jackson, the secretary, Miss Barton sent her final accounting,\r\nasking for its approval, on receipt of which she proposed to return the\r\nbalance in her hands. Her letter is as follows:\r\n\r\n  MESSRS. EDMUND DWIGHT and P. T. JACKSON\r\n  Boston\r\n\r\n  ESTEEMED FRIENDS:\r\n\r\n It has long been a subject of deep regret to me that I have been\r\n unable to make my report of the expenditure of certain sums of money\r\n placed in my hands by you, as agents for the distribution of the\r\n “French Relief Fund” sent by the city of Boston to the people of\r\n France who had been rendered destitute by the war of 1870-71. My\r\n apology for this long delay is physical illness, which overtook me\r\n before the work of distribution was completed in 1872, and has, with\r\n the exception of a few months, held me prostrate from that time until\r\n the present, more than two thirds of the time unable to leave my bed,\r\n and one year unable to transact the smallest item of my own business,\r\n or even hear of it as done by others.\r\n\r\n But all this time it has been a source of pain and unrest to me that\r\n I could not close the account and make the proper returns to you;\r\n and all the more so, as there is still a portion of the money which\r\n I did not expend, and which I desire to return to you; and only He\r\n who knows and comprehends all can know with what gratitude I welcome\r\n the past few weeks of returning strength, which have enabled me to go\r\n over the long undisturbed packages of letters, receipts, and vouchers\r\n which have traveled with and remained by me all these weak and weary\r\n years, and arrange them to be at last given up to you, who have waited\r\n upon my silence with a gentlemanly kindness seldom met in the rough\r\n business of life.\r\n\r\n Although allowed the largest liberty in regard to the place and manner\r\n of the distribution, I knew from you both that your preference lay\r\n in the direction of the _east_ of France, and accordingly Belfort,\r\n Montbéliard, Besançon, Savoie, and Strassburg became the scenes of\r\n my labors: and, as you both know my manner was to give in small sums\r\n to the needy in person, it only remains for me to repeat that I met\r\n the poor of these districts by call, through the civil authorities\r\n presiding over them, listened to each story of want and suffering,\r\n and gave such a sum as assured by the authorities would be most\r\n serviceable to them, and such as they themselves should have given if\r\n left in their hands. I was always cautioned from this quarter against\r\n making the sum too large, as the people had only the habit of small\r\n sums, and were demoralized by too much at once. This, of course, both\r\n increased and prolonged the labor of distribution.\r\n\r\n I remember to have written you that among the most necessitous I\r\n met were the outcoming Alsatians. An extract from a letter of mine,\r\n written at Belfort, October, 1871, and kindly embodied in your report,\r\n renders a further description of this class of sufferers unnecessary\r\n in mine.\r\n\r\n As these self-constituted exiles made their way largely into or\r\n through the districts I was serving, the people were keenly alive to\r\n the distress they witnessed, and humanely devised plans for relief.\r\n The one most practicable to their minds was to form a colony of\r\n Alsatians in the South of France and help them on to it. The climate\r\n was genial and productive, the country not over-populated, and the\r\n mayors and prefects besought me to withhold something for this\r\n enterprise and aid them personally in the establishment of their\r\n colony. I accordingly held back the money I had not expended, and went\r\n to Paris to learn what aid would be rendered by influential persons\r\n and the Government. But Paris was not so unsophisticated as the good\r\n people of the desolated outskirts. She was wise, polite, and had other\r\n aims. She immediately foresaw that these people, once broken up in\r\n their homes and family ties, placed on the borders of the sea studded\r\n with ships, would not withstand a pressure of poverty; but at the\r\n first approach of want would emigrate a second time and to some other\r\n country. Thus France would lose her soldiers, and she counted largely\r\n on the exasperated Alsatians some day to fight for their homes, take\r\n back their lost possessions, and the Rhine. Hence they not only\r\n discouraged but forbade the step, and I had my appropriation left on\r\n my hands. I went to Carlsruhe to deliberate and rest, was worn out,\r\n and became ill, and from that time have never been able either to\r\n apply the funds or (until now) arrange the papers showing how I had\r\n disposed of what I had applied.\r\n\r\n At the end of a year and a half of illness, I was able to figure up\r\n what still is due you, which sum, if satisfactory to you, I shall be\r\n happy to send you in a draft on my bankers.\r\n\r\n Praying that, if upon examination all is not found to be satisfactory,\r\n you will not hesitate to inform me, and thanking you for your kindness\r\n and patience, I remain,\r\n\r\n  With the highest respect\r\n\r\n  Most truly yours\r\n\r\n  CLARA BARTON\r\n\r\n  NEW ENGLAND VILLAGE, MASS.\r\n\r\n  April 24, 1876\r\n\r\n\r\nAccompanying this letter was a detailed statement of all moneys\r\nreceived and expended, with vouchers for the disbursements. This\r\naccount was duly audited, and the committee discovered that Miss Barton\r\nhad deducted nothing for her own expenses, nor for any disbursements\r\nexcepting those for which she had sent vouchers. They therefore sent to\r\nher the following letter:\r\n\r\n MY DEAR MISS BARTON:\r\n\r\n Mr. Dwight informed me sometime since that you have about eleven\r\n hundred and thirty dollars, still on hand, of the money sent to you by\r\n the Committee of the French Fair of which I was treasurer.\r\n\r\n Your account shows that you have made no charge for your expenses, and\r\n that you have charged us only with items for which you have vouchers,\r\n taking no notice of the sums given where you were unable to take\r\n receipts. If the account had been made up with all of these items\r\n included, the balance would have been nearly or quite absorbed.\r\n\r\n The Committee have, therefore, directed me to say that they consider\r\n the account balanced, and request that you will accept this letter as\r\n a receipt in full settlement of your account with them.\r\n\r\n Thanking you for your services in this work of charity and hoping that\r\n your health may soon be restored, I remain with great respect,\r\n\r\n  Yours very truly\r\n\r\n  (Signed) P. T. JACKSON\r\n\r\n  Treasurer French Fair\r\n\r\n\r\nThere still remained in the hands of the Boston committee a sum of\r\nsomething more than three thousand dollars. The committee desired\r\nto present this to Miss Barton, who had accepted no salary during\r\nher period of work, and whose broken health they regarded as in a\r\nlarge measure the result of her arduous efforts for the relief of the\r\nstricken people of France. This was not acceptable to Miss Barton; she\r\ndid not want the money; she wrote that she was almost the last of her\r\nfamily, with no dependents, and had neither use nor desire for money a\r\nday beyond her life nor beyond the simple needs for which her present\r\nincome was sufficient. The committee, therefore, decided to give the\r\nmoney remaining in their hands to the Massachusetts General Hospital\r\nin Boston, with a provision that the interest should be paid to Clara\r\nBarton during the term of her natural life. The hospital concurred in\r\nthis arrangement and faithfully carried out the trust. Clara Barton\r\nreceived an annuity semi-annually on $3251, the amount which finally\r\nwas paid over to that institution. With this action the committee\r\nplaced upon record their high appreciation of her service in France.\r\n\r\n  60 STATE STREET, BOSTON\r\n  July 1st, 1876\r\n\r\n  DEAR MISS BARTON:\r\n\r\n You will wonder at my long silence, but, owing to the absence of\r\n gentlemen of the committee under whom I act, I have only been able to\r\n obtain their signatures to-day.\r\n\r\n The money in the hands of Messrs. Brown Brothers, including interest\r\n on bonds to May first, is $4521, of which one quarter (or $1130)\r\n belongs to Mr. Jackson’s fund. Of this I am directed to pay $150 to a\r\n distressed family from Massachusetts, now in Boston. The balance (or\r\n $3240) to pay to the Massachusetts General Hospital in trust, to pay\r\n income arising from this money to you during your life; afterwards to\r\n become the property of the Hospital.\r\n\r\n In making this arrangement the committee desire to express to you\r\n their high appreciation of your intelligence and self-sacrifice in\r\n distributing the funds placed in your hands, and their great sympathy\r\n with you in your long and painful illness, caused partly by the work\r\n which you did in their behalf. They recognize the great accuracy\r\n of your accounts, the large numbers of vouchers obtained by much\r\n labor, and the scrupulous care with which you have guarded the money\r\n entrusted to you. They wish you good health and a long life.\r\n\r\n I need not tell you, dear Miss Barton, how cordially I join in all\r\n good wishes for your health and happiness. May the Hospital pay your\r\n annuity until the next Centennial.\r\n\r\n  Sincerely yours\r\n\r\n  (Signed) EDMUND DWIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] This was written shortly after the disastrous Chicago fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nHER ILLNESS FOLLOWING THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few letters and no diary during the winter of 1871 and 1872.\r\nClara Barton was at Carlsruhe endeavoring to recover from nervous\r\noverstrain, and learning to write without much use of her eyes. She\r\nsupposed that she had finished her work for French relief, but a letter\r\nfrom a Boston committee informed her that they still had funds for\r\nthis purpose, but were not having good success in the matter of local\r\ndistribution. They begged her to take charge of what remained of their\r\nworking fund. Almost blinded though she was, she set out in winter\r\nand traversed again a route that had become familiar to her, through\r\nMülhausen, Montbéliard, and Strassburg. Her work for women was still\r\ngoing on, and she gave it substantial encouragement and repeated her\r\nChristmas banquet of the preceding year in a New Year’s Eve banquet at\r\nStrassburg. She arranged for the continuation of the work in a way that\r\ndid not pauperize the women. Then she returned to Carlsruhe and spent\r\nthe remainder of the winter. Our chief knowledge of her oversight of\r\nthese activities, as well as of her living arrangements during this\r\nperiod, is contained in a letter to her sister Sarah. She had been\r\nliving in a hotel, but had taken lodgings of her own, had a little maid\r\nto wait on her, and was able to get a breakfast to her liking, which\r\nwas beefsteak and baked potato, instead of the Continental breakfast\r\nof hard rolls and a gallon of coffee. The beefsteak for breakfast is\r\ninteresting because Clara Barton ate comparatively little meat. She\r\nnever, however, became a strict vegetarian. Even in her old age she now\r\nand then indulged in the luxury of a good, thick beefsteak; but this\r\nwas exceptional. Her meals, as a rule, were severely frugal, and mostly\r\nvegetable.\r\n\r\n  CARLSRUHE, Last Day of January, 1872\r\n\r\n  DEAR SISTER:\r\n\r\n I believe I can write you a readable letter without looking on at\r\n all. I have used my eyes pretty much of late, and they complain so\r\n sadly of my bad treatment, that I have decided to give them a rest,\r\n and not write any more at present, but, as I don’t know how long the\r\n rest must continue, I don’t want you to wait without news of me for\r\n an indefinite period. I want to tell you that I did receive your good\r\n long letter, and was exceedingly glad of it. It had been a little age\r\n that I had not heard of you. I must write without a reference to your\r\n letter, for I could not read it to-day; my poor eyes ache too badly\r\n for that. It was long ago that I wrote you, I believe. I don’t know\r\n if I have written since the 25th of November, when I remember to have\r\n done so. If not since, I have never told you anything of my going to\r\n Montbéliard to give something to the poor people there who suffered so\r\n much by the war. I went from Carlsruhe about the middle of December\r\n in the coldest time we have had in all the winter. It was fearfully\r\n cold. Miss Margot went with me. It was a day and a half’s travel,\r\n and some of the way it was so cold in the train I dared not let Miss\r\n Margot fall asleep. I knew she was exceedingly cold, and I kept her\r\n awake through precaution. We spent the first night at Mülhausen with\r\n Mr. and Mrs. Dolphus, French people of literary note, whom I have\r\n known during all the war. Next day we went to Belfort and passed the\r\n night and Sunday with the Administrator, Monsieur Leblue, and arranged\r\n some trunks I had left there in October, and Monday morning we went\r\n to Montbéliard and called on the Prefect (a Jew), to whom I had\r\n previously made a donation of money, and informed him that I wanted to\r\n make the next donation in person. I wished to see, therefore, myself.\r\n He was very amiable and would arrange it, and I left him to do so\r\n while I went still on to Besançon to see the Prefect of Doubs. Here\r\n it was so cold and cheerless I could not sleep at night and returned\r\n next day. I was made the guest of the noble families of the town, for\r\n Montbéliard was an old Court town, and the grandmother of the Czar of\r\n Russia was a Princess of Montbéliard, so they have still relics of\r\n royalty there and a pretty old castle. I found excellent arrangements\r\n for taking care of the poor, the best I have seen in all France. They\r\n have committees of both gentlemen and ladies and the president of\r\n the ladies’ committee is a Mrs. Morell, a person so much like Mrs.\r\n Greffing that I feel as if I had really seen Mrs. Greffing and worked\r\n with her a few days this winter. They assembled in their hall and\r\n called their poor there, and they came in hundreds, and waited in a\r\n long line, or two long lines, reaching from the doors away through\r\n the yard and down the snowy street. At the suggestion of Mrs. Morell\r\n I gave them orders for wood and rent, so that the husbands could not\r\n compel the women to give up the money to them to get drunk on and\r\n abuse the family. We wrote hundreds of orders. I signed them, and then\r\n we went to the hall and received the women. They were my women then.\r\n I admitted them, and gave them the order and took in the next, and so\r\n day after day till all was done. The orders were drawn immediately,\r\n and when I left just before Christmas all the poor had wood for two\r\n months and rent paid until the first of April. They looked so poor,\r\n but were so happy at such an unexpected fortune and I was so glad\r\n to have been able to do it. It was Boston that did this good little\r\n thing--I have written the committee about it, a long letter. I thought\r\n they would be glad to know it while the fires were still burning.\r\n\r\n Then I came back, and I wanted to go to Strassburg and give something\r\n to my old working-women there. They would not be so poor as the women\r\n of Montbéliard, for much had been done for them, but I wanted to see\r\n and remember them, and so I said I would go. I invited Miss Zimmermann\r\n to go with me, as she helped me to organize the Strassburg work last\r\n year. I said I would not give anything in charity to these women; I\r\n had not permitted them to beg--they had always worked for me and been\r\n paid. I would give them a Christmas fête and invite them like other\r\n people. So we bought two splendid pine trees fresh from the Black\r\n Forest, and I knew all my women, so I had only to count the heads\r\n and buy purses. I purchased three hundred good strong morocco purses\r\n with steel clasps, prettily lined, and pretty little things for the\r\n children, and to ornament the trees many dozens of little wax candles\r\n and holders to light the trees. I had stopped at Strassburg on my way\r\n back from Montbéliard and hired the best hall in town for Saturday\r\n night the 30th December. On Wednesday night we went to Strassburg, had\r\n our invitations printed and sent to the women by post; then I ordered\r\n at a good bakery twenty cakes, I cannot tell you how large and high.\r\n Each cake would cut from twenty to twenty-five slices, big slices;\r\n and five hundred rolls, and I took a caterer I knew there to arrange\r\n chocolate and coffee. The hall had a fine kitchen and dining-rooms,\r\n and I asked the banks to change my money into the last issue of French\r\n silver, never used, and they did. The best ladies of the city came to\r\n help us, and the trees were set, the purses filled, the hall arranged,\r\n the tables spread and set so white and clean, and, oh, the trees\r\n were so pretty, on a long platform across all one end of the hall in\r\n front of two enormous mirrors and all the floors spread with moss,\r\n all scattered full of fine-cut white paper and isinglass, which made\r\n perfect snow and ice, and brightened with handfuls of little scarlet\r\n berries; and the hall was so brilliant with chandeliers and mirrors\r\n that one could read the finest print in its most distant corner. I\r\n tell you all this so particularly because I think it was the prettiest\r\n thing I ever saw. Don’t say it was that that made my eyes sore; it\r\n wasn’t. The hour was seven; at six-thirty the women began to arrive.\r\n Mr. Kruger, Vice-Consul from America, received and seated them in the\r\n anteroom till it was time to light the trees. I had not seen them yet,\r\n and did not know that so many were there, but some one came to tell us\r\n that our little wounded children had come and we went to that room to\r\n see and welcome them. When we entered the doorway, all these hundreds\r\n of women rose up before us like an army--not a word, still like so\r\n many soldiers--and stood for us to pass. At seven, the trees were\r\n lighted and the doors opened, and all this regiment of women walked in\r\n and took seats. A fine parlor organ stood under the trees, a Christmas\r\n hymn was struck, and these poor women in the fullness of their hearts\r\n joined in a burst of song such as I never heard before. They sang as\r\n if they meant God should know how glad they were and how grateful\r\n they were to be there. Then there was prayer, an address of welcome (I\r\n wouldn’t have them instructed), and then Mr. Kruger and your sister\r\n went under the trees upon the platform where all the purses hung.\r\n There were elegant ladies to take them down from the trees and hand\r\n them to me while Mr. Kruger called each woman’s name and she came up\r\n and gave her hand to me, and I put in it a purse of silver with her\r\n name and a pretty buff card attached to it; then the ladies took her\r\n round to see the trees and to sign her name at a table presided over\r\n by the Misses Rausche, of Strassburg Boarding School. Afterward they\r\n were taken to the refreshment room and the daughters of the clergymen\r\n of the city, with Miss Zimmermann at the head, received and served\r\n them to chocolate and all the good things; and then they did talk and\r\n laugh and cry for joy, and such a time some hundreds of poor women\r\n almost beggars I think never had. “It was worth going a mile to see.”\r\n\r\n All this time Mr. Kruger and I were giving the gifts, but when it\r\n was done I went and ate with them; then I came back and gave the\r\n gifts to my eleven cutters, ten pretty young girls and one tailor.\r\n I gave them workboxes and portfolios, etc., and then the Comité de\r\n Secours had arranged a little surprise for me, which the women enjoyed\r\n exceedingly. M. Bergmann, my old esteemed friend, the president of\r\n the syndicate of Alsace, addressed the women, and they all crowded\r\n up around the front of the platform like so many children, to listen\r\n to him. He told them, among other things, that Miss Barton had said\r\n she wished they would all keep the money in the little purses as a\r\n keepsake and make it the beginning of a sum for the savings bank,\r\n which would reopen next week. Having told them this, he said to them,\r\n so pleasantly and familiarly, “I think we ought to make her this\r\n promise, eh?” You should have heard the storm of, “Yes, yes, we will,”\r\n that filled the room. This finished the evening, only their good-bye\r\n to me, which each one insisted on making for herself. This occupied\r\n almost an hour, till the last one was gone, and then it was past\r\n eleven, almost twelve, and we went home to our hotel and to bed; but\r\n all the time I knew I had seen a very pretty thing.\r\n\r\n There were about sixty women who did not get their invitations. It\r\n was no wonder; they never had a letter before in their lives and the\r\n letter carriers never heard of them, and they lived in such old\r\n alleys and garrets and cellars they could not be found. But the next\r\n day I made a list of all these and put it in all the papers of the\r\n city, and it was told to them and they came to our old workrooms a few\r\n days afterward and we gave them their purses. When it was all done,\r\n we came back to Carlsruhe, one of the first days of January, and I\r\n have been here ever since. I had a good deal of writing to do, and I\r\n suppose I have used my eyes a little too much. I was going over to\r\n London directly after leaving Strassburg to stay with Abby and Joseph\r\n Sheldon, who are continually writing for me to come to them. I meant\r\n to have been there now, but I received a letter on my return from\r\n Strassburg from the head of the Boston Committee saying that they had\r\n held a meeting after hearing something from me and decided to ask me\r\n to take charge of all their unfinished business in France. They see\r\n that it is going wrong and beg me to take it in hand, even if I cannot\r\n do anything personally, to take the oversight of it. I replied to them\r\n and will wait for their answers. I thought then it would be nonsense\r\n to cross the Channel if I must recross to France again in a few weeks,\r\n so I decided to remain here until I could finish up on the Continent\r\n and go to England free.\r\n\r\n I do long to be free of work once more for a little while. I have been\r\n rather busy. I have a little home here in Carlsruhe. I got tired of\r\n the hotel and took some small rooms, a little apartment, and furnished\r\n it to suit me (rented) and have a little German girl. She was the\r\n private waiting maid of Madame de Mentzinger and I knew her, so I live\r\n as independently as I please. I can arrange my living to suit myself\r\n better. I can have a beefsteak and baked potato for breakfast and not\r\n be driven to a choice between a piece of dry bread and a gallon of\r\n coffee, and I can have my dinner at four and not be forced to eat at\r\n eight o’clock at night, as is done here.\r\n\r\n I am sure you have had a great deal of trouble with my things and so\r\n has Lieutenant Westfall; I am sorry but can’t help it. I want to write\r\n the Lieutenant, but dare not send him one of my blind letters. I must\r\n wait till I can use my eyes again. I am glad you went and visited all\r\n the world of Massachusetts. I want to see our old brother Dave more\r\n than I can tell, and I think I shall sometime. I don’t understand if\r\n Ida has left the Treasury for all time or on a rest. Is she not well?\r\n I am sorry you wandered about waiting for some one to carry you from\r\n post to pillar. Wait a little, Sall, and we will have a coach and one\r\n and ride when we please. I will have it sent over to you every day to\r\n take a ride on condition that you will promise to come and take tea\r\n with me every time, and you shan’t wait to be carried somewhere--it\r\n was all vexatious and heart-aching. I know it all by experience, so\r\n old that it seems to me it must have been a part of another existence;\r\n but it wasn’t; it was only the first end of this old patched and\r\n tangled web. What a good soul-stirring time you had at the Convention,\r\n didn’t you? That was splendid; shall I ever see something like that, I\r\n wonder? What a meeting! How I want to see and know Mrs. Livermore. I\r\n don’t suppose I ever shall, but I knew her so long ago. What beautiful\r\n things she wrote when she must have been so young; no wonder she can\r\n speak well. I speak very much of these things with the Grand Duchess.\r\n She sent for me about a week ago to spend an evening and she spoke\r\n of little else than the progress of woman and schools for girls in\r\n America. She had evidently been reading something, I presume some\r\n German criticism upon the too liberal spirit of America, and wished\r\n to compare notes, I think. I told her all as it was, and I said I\r\n believed in special training for all kinds of life, but that I thought\r\n it possible to train too much till the original spirit was crushed\r\n out and ashes left in the place of coals, and there was danger of\r\n Germany’s doing this with her great respect for discipline; that I\r\n thought them too strict, and that they cramped their people by rules\r\n and regulations and hurt many good original minds. This was plain\r\n speech for a woman in a plain black gown without even a ring on her\r\n hands to address to a Princess and Sovereign, but when I am asked I\r\n answer, let it be where it will. I guess it didn’t offend, for she\r\n sent me a very pretty letter next morning.\r\n\r\n I can’t think what the dress is that you speak of having made up\r\n and washed. I can just recall that I sent something by Dorr, but it\r\n couldn’t have been anything but a piece from my shelves where we cut\r\n for the women. I can’t think if it was calico or cotton gingham. I\r\n know I wanted to send something good, but he was afraid to take it\r\n lest he have trouble at the custom house, and they trouble him about\r\n his own things for it. I know we packed his boxes in terrible haste\r\n one night after midnight and I can’t think of anything more about\r\n them. This was the day but one before I cleared up in Strassburg and\r\n started for Paris. It wasn’t a quite sure thing if one would get there\r\n very safely, and so difficult was it that it took three days to do the\r\n traveling of one day in ordinary times. But it is better now.\r\n\r\n This winter is easier than the last was. I have made some friends and\r\n I am not a stranger in Europe any longer, and I have warm friends in\r\n Strassburg, and, if I do say it, last week Mr. and Mrs. Bergmann came\r\n to Carlsruhe to visit us, i.e., Miss Zimmermann and me. I had them to\r\n tea with me twice (they were at hotel) in my house, and I arranged a\r\n visit for them at Court. This is, I expect, the first social exchange\r\n of visits between a leading French officer and a German Court since\r\n the war--a gentleman may have visited, but not the ladies, but Mrs.\r\n Bergmann and the Grand Duchess visited, and, better still, the poor\r\n women came over to Germany to visit me. I have made some peace between\r\n them if they won’t fight again and spoil it all. I will enclose in\r\n this one of my invitations to the Women’s Fête and Christmas Tree.\r\n Your German letter-carrier will read it to you. Now I think, in mercy\r\n to your eyes, I must stop. Don’t be troubled about me; my eyes will be\r\n well soon. I will be very careful. I know you can’t read near all of\r\n this, but some maybe.\r\n\r\n  Lovingly\r\n\r\n  CLARA\r\n\r\n I thought I couldn’t write any more, but I find it so funny to write\r\n with my eyes shut, as if I were playing blindman’s buff, that I think\r\n I must do another sheet. I was afraid to commence to tell you how nice\r\n I thought your picture gallery was; indeed, I think it was splendid.\r\n How could you think of it all? How did you get up your ideas? I\r\n laughed till I cried again and again; indeed, I am not sure but that\r\n hurt my eyes some. I wish you had told me more about it. I wanted all\r\n the particulars. I related it one evening at tea at Madame General de\r\n Freystadt’s, and you should have seen the merriment of those German\r\n Court ladies--they have a great deal of fun in their heads. They were\r\n especially amused at the old hoop and line, as I explained to them our\r\n bold President swinging around the circle to gain popularity. Miss\r\n Margot has not been initiated into the mystery of your gallery yet, as\r\n she is at Lyons with her people, but is expected to return any day now\r\n to resume her studies here. I will make her full explanations as soon\r\n as she is back. She caricatures me sometimes, to her great amusement.\r\n She would not be bad help for you on such an occasion, as she would be\r\n in the seventh heaven if she could do it.\r\n\r\n No, I didn’t think of the 17th of September as being the day of Lake\r\n City. How well I remember that day, and how anxious a day it was,\r\n but after all, not unhappy. We thought that we had gained so much;\r\n our experiment had not failed and it did not fail in the end; it\r\n accomplished just what you say it did. Our dear boy lived to feel that\r\n he had done his work and was ready to go; a little life it was, but\r\n full and had in it much more than many another of fourscore and ten.\r\n I had not heard of Lizzie Learned’s last affliction. Can this be so?\r\n Where did Lizzie get such a complication of maladies, and is there\r\n anything in the new remedy? I have heard of it. The Grand Duchess asks\r\n me about it. Her first maid of honor, Mademoiselle de Sternberg, of\r\n whom you must have heard me make mention, is supposed to be dying of a\r\n cancer, but she also seems to have a multitude of illnesses. I called\r\n on her a few weeks ago. She was a mere skeleton and is too sick now to\r\n see any but her nurses.\r\n\r\n Does Nancy do the work at home, and are she and Uncle John all there\r\n are? I cannot think how it would seem there without--“Bamma”--poor\r\n dear, honest, faithful, Christian, guileless Bamma! who worked\r\n faithfully up to the last day without complaint and lay down bravely\r\n with the harness of life about her, without a murmur.\r\n\r\n Do you have much fruit this year? I am out of patience with Europe.\r\n I never find fruit here,--it is always a “scarce year,” they say.\r\n Indeed, there was none in all the Rhine Valley. Little gnarly apples\r\n are two and three cents apiece; prunes, which are only the plums which\r\n grow here, dried, are fifty cents a pound, and I have searched the\r\n town over without success for a little dried apple. All oranges here\r\n are always either sour or bitter. I have nearly forgotten, but it\r\n seems to me that we had better fruit arrangements at home. You see by\r\n this that I am quite hungry, don’t you, or I shouldn’t write of it.\r\n Now I think I have finished for this time. I have let my letter wait\r\n two days and my eyes are better.\r\n\r\n  Ever your Sis\r\n\r\n  CLARA\r\n\r\n\r\nReturning to Carlsruhe, she continued her oversight of American relief\r\nfor French destitution by correspondence, though still suffering\r\ngreatly with her eyes. She passed “some very dull weeks, very green and\r\nshady, with exceedingly long nights”; after the acute pain was over,\r\nshe learned to write with bandaged eyes, and wrote a good deal.\r\n\r\nHer friends Mr. and Mrs. Sheldon were in London and were not satisfied\r\nto have her in Germany alone. They sent her peremptory orders to be\r\nready to accompany them when they came, as they were presently to come,\r\ndown the Rhine. She went with them, left Carlsruhe, visited Strassburg\r\non her last tour of inspection, and set out for London by way of Paris.\r\nOn reaching Paris, they encountered an American family by the name of\r\nTaylor, friends of the Sheldons, who had just left London for a tour of\r\nItaly and besought Miss Barton to accompany them. Hastily she changed\r\nher plans, and, after six weeks’ travel in Italy, she came to London.\r\nShe had dropped her diary altogether, and her correspondence with her\r\nrelatives had nearly ceased on account of her impaired eyesight, but\r\nin London she wrote the story of her wanderings to her sister Mrs.\r\nVassall. The last page is missing and the letter ends abruptly, leaving\r\nher in Venice. The Italian tour was finished, however, and in the early\r\nsummer she arrived in London.\r\n\r\n  NO. 5 HEWSON STREET--WANREY STREET\r\n  WALWORTH ROAD\r\n  LONDON, July 5th, 1872\r\n\r\n DEAREST SISTER:\r\n\r\n In one way and another I imagine you must have become aware of me in\r\n England, although I believe I have never told you so directly. By the\r\n presence of a half-finished letter to you, dated March 29th, between\r\n Paris and Turin, Italy, I see that I cannot have written you since I\r\n left Germany just previous to the above-named date. This has all been\r\n very wrong, for I received your good and welcome letter here, via\r\n Berne, early in June. You know me as neither abundant nor graceful\r\n in apologies, although it never hurts my spirit to ask pardon, and\r\n your good intuition will perceive this rather extraordinary sheet of\r\n note-paper to signify contrition, confession, and serious effort at\r\n amendment. For all the interesting details contained in your letter\r\n I thank you very much. They constitute my only landmarks of the old\r\n coast for months; my explorers have been very silent and my scouts\r\n brought small tidings.\r\n\r\n I remember that I wrote you when nearly blind. I had used my eyes\r\n too hard, and at night, which I ought to have known I could not do\r\n with impunity. I passed some very dull weeks, very green and shady,\r\n with _exceedingly_ long nights; although after the greater pain and\r\n nervous excitement was over, I wrote a great deal with them closely\r\n bandaged. This helped to pass the time, but Mr. and Mrs. Sheldon,\r\n who were in London, became altogether dissatisfied with this state\r\n of things, and determined to put an end to some of it by coming\r\n after me and taking me, willing or not, to London. They had given me\r\n a short notice and ordered me to pack my knapsack, while they came\r\n down the Rhine. I obeyed, and, after a visit of a couple of days, we\r\n set out _via_ Strassburg and Paris. I was infinitely better by this\r\n time; still must not put any close strain upon my eyes. I made my\r\n “good-byes” in Strassburg, which was not an easy thing for the “soul,”\r\n and, on reaching Paris, we met a family party of Americans, friends\r\n of the Sheldons, that had just left London for a trip of six weeks\r\n through Italy. There were four of them, Mr. and Mrs. Holmes and their\r\n only daughter and son-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Taylor. Mr. Holmes was\r\n the American Commissioner to the Great International Exhibition in\r\n London in 1862 and in Paris in 1867, and with his family has resided\r\n in London and Paris since, as American representative of science,\r\n skill, invention, etc. They were fine travelers, Italy was a familiar\r\n route to them, and it entered their heads to attach me to their party.\r\n I felt it to be a great piece of temerity on my part to think of\r\n dropping “sans cérémonie” plump into the middle of an elegant family\r\n party arranged for a private travel, and I said so, and said all I\r\n could, but all was overruled, and even Mrs. Sheldon said “go.” It was\r\n “too good an opportunity to lose,” she said, and added at the end of\r\n her advice, “What a fool I am. I always did give up all that I wanted\r\n most”; and so we separated in the streets of Paris, March 28th, five\r\n o’clock in the afternoon, she for London and I for Italy. I had only\r\n a little hand satchel, having stored all my European luggage with my\r\n Paris bankers till my return. I have never written up my trip, so I\r\n cannot give it you, but if I can recall the days a little in order\r\n will try to account for some of them. I will draw hard upon my memory,\r\n which will probably help me accurately to whatever she will help me at\r\n all, she being, not so generally treacherous as repudiatory. I wonder\r\n if that is an English word--it _ought_ to be; if not, I can only plead\r\n two years’ life in _Germany_, and surely out of all that I must have\r\n earned the right to manufacture one word.\r\n\r\n As sightseers, it was not, of course, our policy to travel at night,\r\n and we did it only twice, of which the first night was one. The road\r\n between Paris and Macon, just above Lyons, being as familiar to each\r\n one of us, as that between New York and Washington, we could afford\r\n to miss it. Reaching Macon at sunrise, from there to Euloz and,\r\n passing the custom house, proving ourselves innocent of liquors and\r\n tobacco, we were ushered into Italy through the famous Mont Cenis\r\n Tunnel, eight miles under a mountain, which rises almost six thousand\r\n feet above the level of the sea. It is a well-laid track in the\r\n solid rock, well ventilated and lighted by powerful reflectors each\r\n half-mile. You remember that it was over Mont Cenis that Napoleon I\r\n constructed a road to march his armies into Italy. At ten o’clock at\r\n night we were at Turin. By this time I was conscious of being some\r\n tired; altogether I was not very strong, and, just for variety, I had\r\n a chill in the night, and, of course, decided to abandon my journey\r\n and return. But as Turin was one of the cities to be visited and\r\n naturally two or more days were to be given it, I could afford to wait\r\n and watch further developments. My chill did not recur, and, although\r\n I continued weak for some time, I kept on the journey.\r\n\r\n Turin is a charming city, by far the most modern in appearance of\r\n anything in Italy, well laid out, fine broad streets, excellent\r\n markets, abounding in _fruit_, clean, and entirely free from beggary.\r\n It seems also to have no poor quarter, the general practice being\r\n for every wealthy family to take into its service and care one,\r\n two, or more entire families, lodging them in tenements fitted in\r\n the attic stories of their own residences, rather than below on the\r\n streets, thus at the same time holding surveillance and compelling\r\n _respectability_. I liked the plan. I don’t know if it is one of\r\n Victor Emmanuel’s ideas. You know that Turin was always his Capital\r\n residence, till a few years ago, when he established himself at\r\n Florence, which now is in turn abandoned for Rome. It has over one\r\n hundred churches, very rich in jewels and antiquities. I remember\r\n in the Metropolitan Church to have seen the marble figure, sitting,\r\n lifelike, of Marie Adelaide, the wife of Victor Emmanuel, and mother\r\n of Princess Clothilde of France. The private jewels of the church were\r\n shown us (for a consideration--everything in Italy is displayed for a\r\n consideration), but for no consideration could I undertake to describe\r\n them; images of solid silver, men and women, weighing hundreds of\r\n pounds and covered with jewels, where sometimes one was of greater\r\n value than the massive silver image it adorned. The Royal Palace was\r\n most magnificent; the rooms were all shown. Here, in this gilded salon\r\n where their busts stand, were married Princess Clothilde, and the\r\n Queen of Portugal. The plate-glass mirrors are twenty feet high, and\r\n everything accords with them. The armory contains an entire gallery of\r\n mounted knights in armor, full dress, horses like life, armed to the\r\n teeth, and among them lies the sword that Napoleon used at Marengo.\r\n Above the city is a fine old monastery to which we climbed for a\r\n view of Mont Blanc, Monte Rosa, and all the chain of southern Alps,\r\n snow-white and dazzling, stretching away into the eternal blue.\r\n\r\n On the second of April, Tuesday, we took train for Milan, riding for\r\n hours in the bright spring sunshine of northern Italy, the Alps behind\r\n us, and the Apennines before, the wheat waving in all the freshness\r\n of early green, and the vines just bursting into leaf. Here at Milan,\r\n we were met by a young lady protégée of Mr. Holmes, a young American\r\n girl who is to come out soon as a prima donna. She is finishing her\r\n musical studies in Milan, and, while we were installed at an excellent\r\n hotel, our dinners were always with Mademoiselle Katrina.\r\n\r\n The great sight of Milan is its cathedral, the second in size and\r\n magnificence in Europe; this also I could not justly describe. It is\r\n built entirely of marble, commenced in the thirteenth or fourteenth\r\n century and, like all these old massive structures, never finished.\r\n It covers many acres, and seems to be one sea of turrets rising at\r\n irregular heights toward the clouds. Although the comparison would be\r\n most inelegant, I will say that it reminded me of a shipping-yard,\r\n where the marble turrets and statues take the place of thousands of\r\n masts; indeed, if my memory serve me well, it has 135 spires, and 1923\r\n statues on the outside from the ground to the top and 700 inside.\r\n There is on one of the roofs, which you pass as you ascend (far above\r\n to the top), an entire flower garden in marble, hundreds of flowers\r\n forming minarets, and no two flowers carved alike or representing the\r\n same flower. It was a long way to the top, which at length was gained\r\n after many times of sitting, and (for me) even lying down to rest\r\n on the various roofs passed in leading from one flight of stairs to\r\n another, roofs of pure white marble polished and glistening in the\r\n sunshine like the crust of the snowbanks on the New England hills on\r\n bright winter days. (_I wonder_ if I ever will see them again.) Here\r\n again we saw marvelous jewels, “gold, silver, and precious stones.”\r\n The tomb of Carlo, who “stayed the plague,” is in a chapel beneath;\r\n the coffin and even the roof of the chapel are of solid silver; mass\r\n is held here each morning, and on certain days of the year miracles\r\n are wrought. There are many sacred relics in the cathedral, as several\r\n nails from the Cross, the Virgin’s shroud, and a seamless coat of the\r\n Lord Jesus Christ, etc., etc. The picture _galleries_ were especially\r\n fine, many celebrated originals, among which is Leonardo da Vinci’s\r\n “Last Supper of the Master and Disciples” in the original fresco. And\r\n the celebrated “Ambrosian Library,” so old and rare its volumes were\r\n indeed a curiosity--illustrated volumes of the fourth century. And\r\n the Royal Palace erected on the site of the old palace of the early\r\n Dukes of Lombardy, where Attila thundered about in his destruction.\r\n Later this _Palace_, like nearly all in Italy, had been at some time\r\n or another occupied by Napoleon I. Here was his bedchamber, unchanged,\r\n decorated in scarlet and gold, heavy velvet curtains richly wrought\r\n in flowers of pure fine gold thread. Then the celebrated _theater_\r\n “La Scala,” the largest in the world, its stage one hundred feet in\r\n depth, and wide in proportion, and this, not including the recesses.\r\n The pit alone holds eleven hundred people, and there are six rows\r\n of galleries; one hundred musicians in the orchestra; the principal\r\n boxes are purchased by the nobility for the season, a single box from\r\n four hundred to five hundred dollars (the season). I name all these\r\n particulars for Vester’s benefit; he may be interested in the facts.\r\n Our young prima donna stepped upon the stage (as our visit was in the\r\n daytime) and sang to us; she had sung there before to an audience of\r\n five thousand, but I think she took just as much pains for us, and\r\n I am sure we were not less enthusiastic. I expect some day to hear\r\n her sing when she is _famous_, but it will never afford me greater\r\n pleasure than when she sang to her audience of five in the great\r\n “Scala” of Milan.\r\n\r\n One little incident, happening not long before, was so pretty that I\r\n am tempted to tell it you. “Katrina” (who is of German parents, but\r\n born and always lived in New York) had only been led before the public\r\n once,--i.e., last winter she was the “leading lady” of the first opera\r\n in Turin,--and on the evening of the close of the engagement she was\r\n “called out” to sing a little national air, in which she had been\r\n exceedingly popular. When she stepped before the curtain she found the\r\n entire house a _blaze of light_, which at first nearly “upset” her,\r\n but, gathering up, she went through her air, to the last strain, when\r\n four men entered and placed at her feet an enormous bouquet of the\r\n choicest flowers, nearly four feet across. She managed to accept it,\r\n but attached to it was a note which requested her, when it should be\r\n faded, before throwing it away to open it with care, and at the end\r\n of a week this was done, and hidden among the flowers were found a\r\n magnificent gold watch and chain, pins, necklaces of coral, turquoises\r\n and pearls, bracelets and rings, which I could not enumerate. It had\r\n been ordered and arranged in Geneva, and sent all the way through\r\n the mountain passes to her. I thought this was a pretty success for\r\n the début of a little American girl, studying in a strange land with\r\n little money. As a child she used to sing in New York with Patti.\r\n\r\n But you must be tired of Milan, and wish I would hasten on if I am\r\n going. Well, I will, and so imagine this to be Saturday the 6th of\r\n April, 9 o’clock A.M., and I just taking the train eastward. The\r\n day was so lovely, so full of the springtime, the grass and grain\r\n so green, the swinging vines swaying over all the fields, the birds\r\n literally bursting their little throats, the fields filled with\r\n peasants in gay dress working to merry tunes, and when you could draw\r\n the eyes away from these near scenes they fell to the northward, first\r\n upon a line of dim, hazy blue, but over this, skirting the horizon\r\n again, the whole chain, peak after peak, of ranging Alps, such an\r\n unbroken line of glittering snow--here on the south only four miles\r\n away the field of Solferino where France lost one thousand officers in\r\n a day.\r\n\r\n At 4 P.M. we were at “Verona” wondering if we should see its\r\n “gentlemen” and giving certainly more than our usual interest to this\r\n subject, and at five we halted at a singular dépôt, with no rattle\r\n of cabs, or hacks, no tramping of horses, still as death all about\r\n us, and as we walked out there lay waiting us hundreds of gondolas,\r\n black as a pall, some covered, some open, all drawn up to the side\r\n of the Canal to take us weary travelers to _our hotels_. This was,\r\n indeed, novel, but we selected our _carriage_, stepped in with our\r\n luggage, sat down, and, leaning lazily back, left it to our gondolier\r\n to pick his way through the watery streets, some wide, some narrow,\r\n leading into and out of each other, like veritable city streets and\r\n lanes, the ways on each side lined perfectly thick with old palaces\r\n and majestic buildings of centuries ago, their fronts to the sea and\r\n their magnificent stone steps leading directly into the water, and\r\n when one would pay a call, the gondolier had only to bring his boat\r\n alongside and you stepped out as from another carriage to the steps of\r\n a mansion. We were taken to “Hotel Victoria,” made as comfortable as\r\n a first-class Italian hotel can make one, and after supper commenced\r\n upon the sights. Ah, but there was so much to see, not that it is\r\n a city of enterprise, a flourishing mart of trade or business. Oh,\r\n no, far from it. Venice only exists upon the record of its former\r\n greatness; take all this away and the travelers consequent upon it\r\n and I believe twelve months would find a famine there, but there is\r\n little danger of this while Byron and Shakespeare remain bright in\r\n English literature.\r\n\r\n Here, as everywhere in Italy, one must commence with the cathedral,\r\n and having gone through this, and some scores of churches, the “Campo\r\n Santo” and the Bell Tower, one is at liberty to enter upon the\r\n palaces, gardens, and theaters. But Venice offers some deviations\r\n from this general rule; most cities have prisons, but they have not\r\n all the dungeons of Saint Marc. All have bridges, but all have not a\r\n “Rialto” nor a “Bridge of Sighs.” I suspect I do not need to remind\r\n _you_ of many old or historical facts. You who are always digging into\r\n the past will have them all “papered and labeled” and stored away\r\n ready for use. But I might mention the seventy-two little islands upon\r\n which Venice was built, which were only a part of the Adriatic, and\r\n not reckoned as land at all. A set of not warlike people from here and\r\n there in the vicinity, having grown weary and afraid of their fighting\r\n and troublesome neighbors, mostly from Austria, determined to place\r\n themselves in a position more difficult to attack, came far over the\r\n sea to these little islands and commenced a city, and gave a general\r\n invitation to all war-pestered, peace-loving citizens of the world\r\n to come and join them; from time to time they united their islands,\r\n built their houses for dwelling and trade upon the streets laid down\r\n upon the piles, with one side opening upon the street of earth and the\r\n opposite upon the sea, as I have before described. But--_the depravity\r\n of human nature_!! No sooner were they a little strong and comfortable\r\n themselves than they sent out their ships to prey upon and plunder\r\n their neighbors, and well-nigh ravaged the cities of the earth. They\r\n decorated their palaces with the spoils of other nations, married\r\n the sea, and declared themselves Omnipotent and Divine. Among other\r\n things their religion and church must have a Hero, and they sent afar,\r\n and got (as they said) the body of Saint Mark, brought it, and great\r\n numbers of relics belonging to him, buried it with the divinest honors\r\n in their principal church, and named it Saint Mark, or “San Marco.”\r\n This was as early as the ninth century. It is a large but not handsome\r\n edifice, facing a paved court, a “piazza” some six hundred feet in\r\n length, surrounded by palaces, now used for public purposes, stores,\r\n etc. All the world of Venice walks in the “Piazza of San Marco.” The\r\n pigeon was esteemed a sacred bird with them, and he is still cherished\r\n here and treated with great honor. One of the curiosities to be seen\r\n are the “pigeons of San Marco.” I cannot at this moment recollect\r\n definitely enough to state to you how many hundreds are supposed to\r\n reside in the immediate vicinity, but their dinner hour is two o’clock\r\n in the afternoon. The great bell of the clock strikes three quarters\r\n past one and they commence wheeling and circling into the court, they\r\n cover the fronts of all the buildings, sit as thickly as possible\r\n upon every window seat, hang in all the cornices, and stand in full\r\n platoons in every foot of spare pavement for a number of rods around\r\n the especial corner where their dinner is served. A young man (it was\r\n formerly a young girl) is appointed by the Government as feeder of\r\n the pigeons. It is not necessary to say that he is punctual with his\r\n repast--he could not live with his tumultuous boarders if he were not.\r\n As the bell strikes two, he pours the grain from--\r\n\r\nThe rest of this letter is missing, but from this time on her letters\r\nbecame frequent, and we are able to follow her, almost day by day.\r\n\r\nHer health by this time was much improved. She established pleasant\r\nlodgings in London, where her old friends the Sheldons and her new\r\nfriends the Taylors were, and followed her lifelong habits by rising\r\nat five o’clock in the morning and getting in four and a half hours’\r\nactivity before any one else in the house appeared for breakfast.\r\nShe heard Stanley, who had just returned from Africa, and, in the\r\ncontroversy which ensued between him and the Geographical Society, she\r\nbecame a warm partisan of Stanley. Antoinette Margot joined her. She,\r\ntoo, had lived through the war without breaking down, but, when she\r\nhad nothing to do but to sit down at Carlsruhe and paint, she gave way\r\nto nervous overstrain. Mrs. Taylor found her Italian trip rather too\r\nmuch for her and wanted a quiet place outside of London, so they rented\r\na summer home in the Isle of Wight and there spent some restful and\r\nhealth-giving weeks. For a company of nervous invalids, they appear\r\nto have had a very merry time. The following jingle was written in\r\nLondon in 1872 for reading at a social gathering of a few families and\r\nAmerica’s friends, who met once a week for social intercourse over a\r\ncup of tea and light refreshments, enlivened by recitations.\r\n\r\nThe family names are somewhat significant--Mr. and Mrs. Holmes, Mr. and\r\nMrs. Taylor, Mr. and Mrs. Bacon, Mr. and Mrs. Darling, and Mrs. Cynthia\r\nCare, a friend then absent.\r\n\r\nMr. Taylor was the inventor of the McKean drill.\r\n\r\n  Since time commenced its cycles, or the memory of man\r\n  Hath record or tradition of pastoral tribe or clan,\r\n  They have never failed to chronicle that men from far and near\r\n  Have met to sharp or blunt their wits in liquor, wine or beer.\r\n  This ancient custom, reaching back into the hoary past,\r\n  Wears a dignity and prestige that rivals even caste;\r\n  And bold are they who dare to meet in social gathering free,\r\n  And call not to the festal board one of the classic three.\r\n  But here’s a jolly company, from far across the sea,\r\n  Dares tune its mirth and sharp its wit in a cup of good Bohea.\r\n  We’re here from many hundred miles, where the western ocean foams,\r\n  But, though a paradox it seems, we have not left our Holmes.\r\n\r\n  The _social_ homes of England draw us to her like a band,\r\n  For we are but the children of this true old glorious land.\r\n  Of the “_merry homes_” of England our great-grandsires used to tell,\r\n  But with pride and joy we prove it here, that we’ve Merry Holmes as\r\n   well.\r\n  Disclaiming all comparison, we write ours brave and free\r\n  And kindly and hospitable as any Holmes can be.\r\n  But we have very English grown, so soon we habits take on,\r\n  We cannot even sip our tea, but we must have our Bacon.\r\n  But English or American, it matters not a straw,\r\n  For both hang out before the world without a taint or flaw.\r\n  Go search through British literature, down to her Common Laws,\r\n  And find what strength and nourishment it from its Bacon draws;\r\n  And if you doubt America can follow in the van,\r\n  Go test our “Cincinnati sides,” and “West Virginia ham.”\r\n  So perfect in itself is each, it’s patent to my mind\r\n  The choicest Bacons that can be, are just the two combined.\r\n\r\n  By the watery distance we have come one might judge us merely sailors,\r\n  But we’re nae thoughtless nor improvident, for we’ve even bro’t our\r\n   Taylors.\r\n  One doesn’t know how long ago, the unjust trick began\r\n  To stigmatize a tailor as the ninth part of a man;\r\n  But though as old and honored as the Judge’s wig and gown,\r\n  Before the faithless falsehood I throw my gauntlet down:\r\n  Yes, tho’ it was with Adam for the modest blush that came\r\n  When he sewed his scanty fig leaves, and dropped his head for shame;\r\n  Tho’ old as this--and thick, and black, and firm as granite, too,\r\n  We’ll drill it to a honeycomb, and let the daylight through.\r\n  So lay upon our Taylor here your nicest chalk-line true,\r\n  And measure him, in soul and vim, as he would measure you;\r\n  You’ll find, Sir Scandal, when you’ve done the best you ever can,\r\n  In reach of thought, and breadth, and depth, he’s every inch a man.\r\n  What did I say? I’m wrong--crave grace--to err is ever human--\r\n  Ah, with what pride of sex I claim, his better half a woman--\r\n  Tho’ fair Fidele and tender she walketh by his side,\r\n  He can neither make nor mend her, but hold fast in his pride;\r\n  And though no mortal’s meeker, we find from far and wide\r\n  The best and wisest seek her, for a pattern and a guide.\r\n  And does the critic here step in, and call us frozen-hearted,\r\n  And lacking in paternal love, that we so long are parted\r\n  From clinging dear ones left to pine like caged and crying starlings?\r\n  Hold, sir! Here’s ointment for your wrath, for we have bro’t our\r\n   Darlings.\r\n  We hold them very near us, with tender love and true;\r\n  Their happiness and welfare are never from our view;\r\n  And though we’re willing sometimes that they abroad should roam,\r\n  We would not spare our darlings forever from our home.\r\n\r\n  There’s one, methinks, whose eloquence erst charmed this happy band,\r\n  Who stays away through many a day in a sunny foreign land--\r\n  Who lingered where the soft moonlight plays through the Colosseum,\r\n  And troops of idle beggars wait for strangers’ hands to fee ’em.\r\n  Or where the setting sun goes down on Monte Rosa’s crest,\r\n  And hoary Blanc bids grand good-night to the cloudlets in the west,\r\n  And who strays even now, ’mong the vines and the trees,\r\n  And walks the green slopes of the dark Pyrenees.\r\n  Given us to be jurors and judge of this action,\r\n  We’d reduce this delay to a very small fraction;\r\n  But being quite powerless our cause to defend,\r\n  We must learn to endure what we cannot amend.\r\n\r\n  As the best of a bad case, let’s forgive her, shall we,\r\n  And drink to her health in a cup of Bohea?\r\n\r\n  And now for our bumpers but one greeting waits\r\n  While we roll back our thoughts to the United States,\r\n  For United as one they must ever remain,\r\n  Since the blood of a million hath rusted the chain.\r\n  With a link in each hand died the true and the brave,\r\n  And sunk side by side in the low martyr’s grave.\r\n  Their bones rest in peace ’neath the soil of their love,\r\n  While their souls keep calm watch on the ramparts above.\r\n  We would hide nae her faults, this dear land of our pride;\r\n  We know she has errors on many a side;\r\n  She’s restless, impatient, hurries on through her day,\r\n  And treads on old customs that lie in her way.\r\n  She’s bold in her speech, but there’s nae lack of truth,\r\n  And her faults, let us hope, are the failings of youth.\r\n  Yes, she’s young--oh, so young--and her robes are so bright,\r\n  For she’s made herself gay with the stars of the night,\r\n  And thrown o’er her shoulders a mantle of light\r\n  That the oppressed of all nations keep ever in sight.\r\n  Oh! each grasp the tissue that floats on the wind,\r\n  For hid in its folds lie the hopes of mankind!\r\n  Oh! guard Thou her ways, Great Eternal Lord God;\r\n  Let her meekly but safely pass under thy rod!\r\n\r\n  With her faults and her virtues we trust her to Thee\r\n  And drink to her life in our cups of Bohea.\r\n\r\n  CLARA BARTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nRETURNING HOME\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be pleasant to record that the benefits derived from this\r\nhappy outing on the Isle of Wight proved permanent, but unfortunately\r\nthat was not the case. Had Clara returned to America in the autumn,\r\nit might have been better, but she went back to London for the winter\r\ndetermined to brave its fogs. She had discovered, with many of her\r\ncountrymen, that it is a mistake to expect relief from cold weather\r\nby going to a warm climate. The people who live in warm climates do\r\nnot know how to prepare for the cold. In London they knew at least the\r\nvalue of a fire. To London she went, and the results were depressing.\r\nHer throat and chest were affected badly by the London fogs. All the\r\ngains of previous months seemed to have been lost, and she was as far\r\nfrom well as she was at the end of the Franco-Prussian War. At this\r\ntime she wrote to Mrs. Vassall, who had returned from Washington and\r\nwas living in Worcester:\r\n\r\n  LONDON, July 11, 1873\r\n  EUSTON ROAD\r\n\r\n  DEAREST FANNIE:\r\n\r\n Your dear good letter and that of your “Bear” came a few days ago. It\r\n is funny to be interviewed at that distance, and I am glad that you\r\n got no worse reports than you did. I don’t think I am so homesick as\r\n it would seem, but I am weak, and little things seem such a burden to\r\n me that it hinders me from doing many things that would make me more\r\n at ease if they could be done. However, one must be patient; it is not\r\n a month yet that I was in my bed most of the day, and now I can go\r\n about town, and even once have been _out_ of town, but not for a long\r\n trip.\r\n\r\n It is kind of you all to offer to come to help me, but I believe I\r\n shall be able to get over my difficulties without giving so much\r\n trouble to any one. By “getting over them,” I mean measurably over\r\n them. I cannot say that I even hope to be strong again as I was before\r\n this last illness. I cannot tell, but it would be a wonder to me if\r\n sufficient nervous strength returns to permit any degree of _real_\r\n usefulness. The greatest trouble I meet now is to bear the little\r\n burdens of contact with the persons and things around me, and not\r\n show too plainly that I have not strength and composure to bear them\r\n calmly; in short, to “hold my horses,” You, dear Fannie, will know\r\n what that means, and how to the weak the grasshopper becomes a burden.\r\n I am glad you have found a physician who has some strength for you,\r\n if it is really so; but I must confess that my previously small share\r\n of confidence in medical aid and wisdom has not increased by the last\r\n year’s experience.\r\n\r\n I hear of you in the most trying heat at home. It is just warm in\r\n England some days, but to-day, for instance, ladies are generally\r\n clothed in wool suits and a shawl. I went out just now for a few\r\n minutes with Mamie, while our rooms were put in order, and came back\r\n because I was too cold, and it is never very bright in London. I\r\n suppose this has its due influence on one’s nervous system, and I\r\n would have been glad at any time within the last month to be made\r\n ready and go over to France or Germany. I think it would be better,\r\n but I could not get strong enough to _get ready_ and go. You wonder\r\n what “getting ready” means. It seems to you that it requires little\r\n preparation to put up a bag or small trunk of things and cross the\r\n Channel, and so it does, but it is summer, and I have several trunks\r\n of mainly woolen things for this cool climate. My little strength\r\n since I have been in Europe has made it necessary to have them, of\r\n course, unpacked, and in a state of utter confusion, for some trunks\r\n I have not had my hand in for months and months, but to others I\r\n constantly go, and in haste. The _moths_ in London are like flies in\r\n abundance. It wouldn’t mend my nerves to know I had gone off traveling\r\n and left all I have to be devoured, and I have been made worse several\r\n times by simply attempting to get a dress or some little article from\r\n a trunk. My weak chest will not admit of the least labor of the arms\r\n yet. Let Mamie do it? Mamie is only a weak little girl, and until\r\n lately could not have packed her own trunk without harm to herself. So\r\n I wait for strength as an army waits for quartermaster and commissary\r\n supplies before it can march. I made one little trial or two, to see\r\n what I could do. Papa Holmes (with whose family I went to Italy) came\r\n one day to ask me if I could go to Liverpool where he was going, and\r\n over into Wales, and pass a week. It was about the time Colonel Hinton\r\n was going to sail, and I thought, with so many good friends on the\r\n road, I might try it. So I went as far as Stratford-on-Avon, but I\r\n grew so tired I gave out and let the party go on and I came home. It\r\n wasn’t much of a journey,--only a few hours,--but I found it quite\r\n sufficient.\r\n\r\n It is really quite astonishing what those sleeping fellows tell, and\r\n how they look us all through! I don’t think I am so homesick, if that\r\n is the term they give it, but no one knows--only those who have tried\r\n it--what the depressing atmosphere of London may be to one who is not\r\n strong, and more especially to one who feels he is never to leave it,\r\n as I expected last winter. I think I could have faced the prospect\r\n of the dark river with a stouter heart if I had been strengthened\r\n by a few glimpses of sunlight sometimes, but I waited such months\r\n watching my little window panes for a patch of sky over which one\r\n could discover that a cloud _moved_, but the surface was never light\r\n and thin enough for this. It was as immovable as a sheet of zinc; one\r\n felt himself already in a metallic coffin, only waiting to be closed\r\n in a little snugger, and have the screws turned down. But I have\r\n tried to be cheerful and as full of life and fun as I could be, with\r\n so little ability to speak as I have had, and it _may_ be that you\r\n and your Mamma Sally’s sleeping men see deeper and get nearer to the\r\n reality than those about me, or than perhaps even I am well aware of.\r\n It is possible I have at times succeeded in cheating myself a little;\r\n all the better if it is so. I should be glad to be spared the trial\r\n of going on to the continent of Europe again. I am _so tired_ of it,\r\n I never want to see it again, but it may be best, and then _Mamie\r\n ought_ not to leave Europe without going there. I should be sorry to\r\n embark her for America having seen only poor smoky old London. If\r\n some one of our friends had been coming over, with whom I could have\r\n sent her to journey some, I should have been very glad of it. I can\r\n perhaps arrange it from here, but up to the present moment I have not\r\n been able to find the right opportunity. I thank you very much, dear\r\n Fannie, for all your interest and care, and hope I may never find a\r\n chance to repay it in the same manner.\r\n\r\n  Afternoon\r\n\r\n Mr. Sheldon has just drawn a letter out of his pocket and, looking\r\n very wise, announced to me that he had just commenced a correspondence\r\n with a very pleasant lady of Worcester and, showing the envelope,\r\n _I_ judged the correspondence had been commenced with the lady’s\r\n _husband_. But I read it, and became convinced that it was from the\r\n lady herself. He informed me that he had replied at the earliest\r\n moment, and it happened to be just when they had succeeded in pushing\r\n me off for my trip, so he had an opportunity to talk large, but he had\r\n scarce time to answer until I was back, and he waited a day or two to\r\n see if he might show your letter to me.\r\n\r\n I hope Ber will have had an opportunity to hear direct from me, as I\r\n gave his Boston address to Colonel Hinton, who promised to see him if\r\n he could find him. I have seen no one who was going to Worcester or\r\n I would have sent him to you. As for me, I shall try to go home this\r\n autumn, I suppose. America will at all events be as well as here,\r\n and has a greater range of climate with easier travel. As for the\r\n prospects of a full recovery of my original health (i.e., previous to\r\n last winter) I cannot decide yet. I may, when once out of this climate\r\n and atmosphere in which I have fallen, recover at once and fully;\r\n and I may never be able to throw off the effects of such prolonged\r\n prostration. My own opinion inclines strongly to the latter. I do not\r\n think any one need come to see me home; I should be sorry to give that\r\n trouble to any one, and will do my best to get on by myself. And now,\r\n with a kiss and great love to all, and the best to your own dear self,\r\n I am as ever\r\n\r\n  Yours\r\n\r\n  CLARA\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Fannie’s husband, Bernard Barton Vassall, the “Ber” or “Bear” of her\r\nplayful letters, she had already written:\r\n\r\n  5 HEUSEN ST., WANSEY ST.\r\n  WALWORTH ROAD, LONDON, April 8, 1873\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR GOOD BOY BER:\r\n\r\n I cannot tell you how good and kind it was of you to hasten to write\r\n me as soon as you knew I had need of a word of sympathy; neither can\r\n I tell how it did me good and made me better and stronger. I was so\r\n weak and ill that day. It came at night with one from your mother,\r\n and they were the first words of sympathy that had come to me from\r\n the old home. I almost hesitate to tell you how long I held them\r\n in my hands. I looked at them till they were damp with fever and\r\n perspiration before I opened them and kept saying softly to myself,\r\n “There’s something good for me in there; there are good kind words\r\n and sympathy.” I waited still and held them close till I got a little\r\n accustomed to them, and then I got raised up a little in my hot bed\r\n and read them all through and through, and Mamie read them all to\r\n me again. How they helped me on after that worst and weakest and\r\n hardest of all the days I have passed in all this illness! It seemed\r\n providential that they should come just then. It was not my cough\r\n that was holding me so low at that moment. I don’t know if in all I\r\n have written your mother, I have ever told her _how_ I got a part\r\n of my illness. I had two physicians, one daily and one consulting\r\n occasionally. He came one day in early March, and recommended me to\r\n be taken out of bed and bathed in water each day, put back awhile,\r\n then taken up and dressed. I could not stand alone, but this was done\r\n two days. I had only my cough then, but the third morning after the\r\n bathing and “gaping” I couldn’t straighten a limb. It proved to be\r\n inflammatory rheumatism from my body to my toes; then in two weeks a\r\n relapse and a rheumatic fever set in, which was at its height when\r\n your letters arrived. But the port wine broke the fever and I am\r\n nearly past the effects of the rheumatism, have little or no pain,\r\n and my cough is not dangerous now, I am sure; I sleep pretty well for\r\n me, and I eat good substantial food. Now, if I can hold fast to all\r\n these improvements, I cannot think it will be necessary for any person\r\n to leave home and business to come to me. I could not be come _for_\r\n at present, for I should not dare attempt the voyage yet, and I hope\r\n to be able to get along by myself, especially as it is almost summer\r\n now. But, dear Ber, I think every moment how good and kind it was of\r\n you to say you _would_ come if I needed you, and if I should “go to\r\n the bad” again, I fear I shall need you. If such a miserable state of\r\n things comes, I will telegraph, and you will all consult, and do what\r\n seems best to you to do. You know much better than I what would be\r\n well to do, and, if it must be done, you will do it. Doesn’t the State\r\n want to send you over to make some investigations? In that case it\r\n wouldn’t seem such waste of ammunition on small game as to come just\r\n to look after poor miserable me, who never amount to anything anywhere.\r\n\r\n But, Ber, I _shall never have done_ thinking how quick and kind you\r\n were in writing me, and what strength and purpose I felt in every line\r\n of your letter, and it strengthens me still. You saw so clearly how I\r\n needed a strong arm near me; all about me is _so weak_. I have managed\r\n everything since my illness, for myself, and all around me, from my\r\n banking business and correspondence to my butcher and grocer, the\r\n airing of my linen, and the arranging of the chairs in my room. There\r\n is no mind or will or thought that can go one inch beyond me, when I\r\n stop. There is no hand that has enough magnetic force to take away one\r\n nervous twinge, not a hand that does not take magnetism from me even\r\n now, and days when I am weakest, I cannot let a hand be laid upon me,\r\n to rub, or even comb my hair. I feel the loss of strength directly and\r\n fall into nervous perspiration. I tell you all this because I read\r\n between the lines of your dear letter that you half divined the case,\r\n and I may as well confess it. I believe I can bring myself up out of\r\n this weakness, and then I will come home to thank you, and be “put in\r\n my little bed.” Won’t you write me again soon, now you know how it\r\n does me good?\r\n\r\n Dear Fannie offers her “Bear” to me,--what a good Bearess she is,\r\n isn’t she? Now, dear Ber, with a great big kiss, and I can’t say that\r\n there aren’t a few other little things dropped along with it, here, my\r\n good boy, is my good-bye.\r\n\r\n  From Your Old Sick Auntie\r\n\r\n  CLARA\r\n\r\n Ber, you must hold your good mother steady and not let her get\r\n alarmed. It will never do for her to come all this way on such an\r\n errand. In any case it would be _too hard_ for her.\r\n\r\nThough neither medicine nor the climate availed to help her, she found\r\nsome measure of relief in a cheerful spirit. Of her system of mental\r\ntherapeutics she wrote to her niece Mamie Barton, Mrs. John Stafford:\r\n\r\n Auntie wants to write Mamie a little letter. She is more sorry than\r\n she can tell that she has such a stupid illness that forbids her to be\r\n company for any one.\r\n\r\n Auntie does not feel less social for this and, although it is hard\r\n and painful, she will not feel despondent a moment, but hopeful and\r\n cheerful for the present and future, if the circumstances immediately\r\n about her do not combine to depress her to a degree which she _cannot_\r\n control. If she had a headache or a nervous head which a noise would\r\n disturb or make ache, there would be some good reason for all about\r\n her to keep quiet, and leave her to her rest and reflections; but she\r\n has nothing of this, and never has. Her head is strong physically.\r\n (She will not refer to its mental qualities.) And as she has nothing\r\n to do all night but to rest and reflect, she does not need special\r\n opportunity for these during the day. If she were all alone, she\r\n would not get lonely or nervous on account of the quiet and silence\r\n about her. She has had great experiences in this and is accustomed\r\n to it. But when she feels herself imposing a dull dead silence on\r\n all persons about her, those whom she loves most dearly and for\r\n whose hourly comfort and happiness she would sacrifice anything in\r\n reason and see her dear little girls gliding about without speaking a\r\n sentence,--never sees a laugh or scarce a smile,--it makes her feel\r\n herself such a restriction, such a detractor from their happiness\r\n and leaves her such a prey to sad reflections and makes her feel the\r\n misfortune of her illness so deeply that at times it seems impossible\r\n to bear it. She grows more and more depressed every minute and the\r\n poor strained nerves refuse longer control, and, in spite of all her\r\n womanly determination, break into tears and groans. This would make me\r\n very ill in time. Mamie doesn’t want this of all things, Auntie knows,\r\n and she writes this poor little letter to explain to her the causes\r\n and the results, and tell her how to avoid the one and improve the\r\n other.\r\n\r\n Just, then, throw away the old-time, never-to-be-departed-from notion,\r\n handed down from nobody knows where, that all ill or ailing persons\r\n are to be treated the same, and that mainly like a dead person,\r\n surrounded by dumb watchers, and dim tapers, waiting to be buried,\r\n and remember that one whose heart is cheery and one whose mind is\r\n active, but whose mouth is closed to speech, might like to borrow\r\n the use of the mouths of those around them--might and must want,\r\n most of all, some one to talk for them--to say the nonsense and make\r\n the fun they cannot say and make for themselves. And that nothing\r\n so much as a good funny time a day would so shorten and deaden the\r\n pain that must be borne in either case. Now, if the two dear good\r\n little girls could only bring themselves to have the same chatty day\r\n that Auntie knows they would have if they were in their own room by\r\n themselves, laughing, singing, doing nonsense, and, in short, feeling\r\n themselves perfectly free to enjoy themselves as I always know they\r\n do when by themselves, Auntie would be more grateful to them than for\r\n anything else they could do for her. And she has faith in the good\r\n understanding of her dear Mamie, to believe that she still sees the\r\n real state of the case as she could _not_ see it before. And she knows\r\n that once she sees it, that big lump of Benevolence just on the top\r\n of her head, will not permit her to do anything but have a good jolly\r\n time in spite of her disagreeable old Auntie who can’t just now help a\r\n bit to make it, but who needs it more than ever, and most of all.\r\n\r\n Mamie needn’t work on that old puzzling dress unless she _greatly\r\n desires_ to.\r\n\r\n Now, with great love, and great hopes, and sincere commiseration,\r\n Auntie closes this her first epistle to the daughter of David and\r\n waiting to hear her cry out in a “loud voice,” she remains as usual\r\n\r\n  OLD DOLOROUS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe summer, however, did her some good. She was able to get out and do\r\na little sight-seeing, her longest journey being to Stratford-on-Avon.\r\nEarly in October she sailed for home on the steamship Parthia.\r\n\r\nOnly a few weeks before she had believed that she had but a short time\r\nto live, or that if she lived it must be as a hopeless and permanent\r\ninvalid; but with even the beginning of a restoration to health she\r\nrecalled her determination to introduce in America the Red Cross,\r\nunder whose auspices she had labored on the battle-fields of Europe.\r\nShe knew that America had no knowledge of, or interest in, the Red\r\nCross. She had good reason to question whether it would be possible for\r\nher immediately to stir up any great enthusiasm for it. But she was\r\ndetermined to live and bring this to pass.\r\n\r\nAs usual on trans-Atlantic voyages, there was a concert in the cabin\r\nof the Parthia. Clara Barton, returning to America as the heroine\r\nof two wars, was asked to participate. She made her contribution to\r\nthe evening’s entertainment in a poem which she wrote on shipboard,\r\nin which she expressed her ardent desire and her solicitude. She was\r\ngoing back to America after a long absence. Was there anything for her\r\nto do when she got here? For daily bread she had no concern and no\r\nneed for concern. Her modest income was adequate for her still more\r\nmodest needs. Even while traveling abroad she had found no occasion to\r\nencroach upon her principal, and her expenses at home were certain to\r\nleave her each year a little margin between income and outgo. But there\r\nhad entered into her soul a vision of the contribution which she might\r\nbe permitted to make to America and the world by securing America’s\r\nadhesion to the international treaty which included the recognition of\r\nthe Red Cross. Would America listen to her when she pleaded for this?\r\nHad it room for her and her mission?\r\n\r\n\r\nHAVE YE ROOM?\r\n\r\n  Five days from New York--five days did he say?\r\n    Only five days from the glistening bay,\r\n  That four years ago I sailed tearfully o’er\r\n    Watching the sunny light fade from the shore!\r\n  As the kerchiefs had faded along the dense pier,\r\n    And the God bless you’s died on the listening ear.\r\n  Tearfully, prayerfully, sailing away,\r\n    Past the green islands, and out of the bay,\r\n  Recalling in pain they who sorrowed and wept,\r\n    More painfully still the brave who had slept;\r\n  Tearfully, prayerfully sailing away\r\n    In search of the strength that went out in the fray.\r\n\r\n  It were easy to search for the gems of the sea,\r\n    The jewels and gold hid in mountain and lea,\r\n  The thin veins of silver that line the green sod,\r\n    But health is of wisdom, and strength is of God.\r\n  Four wearisome years in lands strange and old,\r\n    Watching the changes that over them rolled,\r\n  How the calm shadows lay in the valley of rest,\r\n    And the black war cloud gathered from out of the west;\r\n  How lancer and _tireur_ dashed o’er the plain\r\n    And the smiles fled the face of sweet Alsace-Lorraine.\r\n  And helmet and turban lay soaked in the rain\r\n    And the masterless dog lapped the wounds of the slain.\r\n  Fair sons and brave husbands there lingered not one,\r\n    And the far childless widow prayed--Thy will be done.\r\n\r\n  How the old nations groaned on their unstable beds,\r\n    As the great car of progress rolled over their heads,\r\n  Uprooting old forms, time-honored of sages\r\n    Sowing new truths for the incoming ages.\r\n  Republics have sprung on the steps of the throne,\r\n    Kingdoms have crumbled, empires have grown;\r\n  Princes and prelates have listened their doom,\r\n    And ermine and gold-decked the refugee’s tomb.\r\n\r\n  Strange sights for strange eyes as the old cities burn,\r\n    And battle and siege follow each in their turn.\r\n  I have heard the faint note of the last sentry’s call,\r\n    And seen the white flag flutter out o’er the wall;\r\n  I have bound up death wounds lying dark and alone,\r\n    And the language that blessed me was strange and unknown.\r\n  The homeless and famished clung wild with despair,\r\n    And the noble and gentle have cherished me there.\r\n  Still trustingly,--loyally: loving and true,\r\n    Anxious and glad, I am coming to you.\r\n  Have ye place, each beloved one, a place in your prayer,\r\n    Have ye _room_, my dear countrymen, room for me there?\r\n\r\n  How the strength rose and fell in those perilous years!\r\n    What torture it made of my hopes and my fears,\r\n  When I joyed in its rise or wept for its fall,\r\n    It was never myself that I thought of at all.\r\n  But if only once more I might tread the loved land,\r\n    And toil for its weal with my heart, and my hand;\r\n  Have ye place, each beloved one, a place in your prayer,\r\n    Have ye _work_, my brave countrymen, work for me there?\r\n\r\n  Plow on, old Parthia, steady and true,\r\n    Each plunge of thy prow brings them nearer to view;\r\n  Brings me nearer the days that shall settle the doubt\r\n    If they’ve kept me within--or have left me without.\r\n  For my feeble hands failed while care rested on all,\r\n    And trouble and grief wrapped them round like a pall.\r\n  Who shall say that the storms have not scattered my sheaves,\r\n    Or the winter winds buried the fallen autumn leaves,\r\n  Or the gaping seas closed without anger or frown,\r\n    And the freighted ships crowd where the lone wreck went down?\r\n  _Have_ ye place, each beloved one, a place in your prayer,\r\n    Have ye _room_, my dear countrymen, room for me there?\r\n\r\n  STEAMSHIP PARTHIA, MID-ATLANTIC\r\n  _October 8, 1873_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE YEARS OF SICKNESS AND RECOVERY\r\n\r\n1873-1880\r\n\r\n\r\nClara Barton came back from Europe wearing the jewel of the Red Cross\r\npresented to her by Queen Natalie of Serbia. She was the only person in\r\nAmerica who then, or for nine years thereafter, wore the Red Cross. She\r\nwas the sole person in the United States who, by service or any form of\r\nofficial recognition, was entitled to that decoration. She wore also\r\nthe Iron Cross of Merit, presented to her by the Emperor and Empress of\r\nGermany. She wore a Gold Cross of Remembrance, presented to her by the\r\nGrand Duke and Duchess of Baden; and from Louise, the Grand Duchess,\r\nshe wore, and prized beyond all wealth, a magnificent amethyst, said\r\nto have been the finest amethyst in this country. From poor, defeated\r\nFrance she wore no official decoration, but she brought the love and\r\ngratitude of innumerable people there to whom she had ministered.\r\n\r\nOn her return to America, she went to her old home in Washington, on\r\nPennsylvania Avenue and Capitol Hill, the home she had purchased before\r\nleaving, but occupied so short a time before her nervous breakdown.\r\nBut she was not permitted to live there very long, because the corner\r\nwas too noisy. Her physician, Dr. Thompson, commanded her to live\r\nelsewhere. The doctor assigned her her limits, “jail-limits” she called\r\nthem; she might live somewhere between Seventh and Sixteenth Streets,\r\nand on the farther side of New York Avenue.\r\n\r\nShe established herself at the corner of Fourteenth and F. Her letters\r\nto her nieces in this period are cheerful, but written under the burden\r\nof physical pain and nerve fatigue.\r\n\r\nOn May 23 she received word that her sister Sarah, Mrs. Vester Vassall,\r\nwas fatally ill. Though far from well, she hastened to Massachusetts,\r\narriving in the evening to find that her sister had died that morning.\r\nThe shock of her sister’s death, coming as it did when her own health\r\nwas so precarious, brought back her old trouble with full force. For\r\nseveral months she remained in Oxford and Worcester, and then went to\r\nNorth Grafton--New England Village it was called--where her relatives,\r\nthe Learned family, had a country home. There she took a house, and\r\nremained for a considerable time attended by Minnie Kupfer, who had\r\nserved with her in the Franco-Prussian War, and, like Antoinette\r\nMargot, had followed her to this country. Her health varied with the\r\nseason and with other conditions not all of them easy to determine.\r\nThere were times when she had hard chills, followed by dripping sweats.\r\nThere were weeks when she had no strength even to lift her head. There\r\nwere bright days also, when she moved about with some approach to\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nWhat was the real nature of Clara Barton’s illness during this long\r\nperiod of suffering? Material is not lacking for a fairly accurate\r\ndiagnosis. Having exhausted the resources of local physicians, she\r\nentered into correspondence with a series of doctors, each of whom\r\nprofessed to be able to bring her permanent relief. Some of these\r\ncalled for very little information about her condition. Their remedies\r\nwere supposed to cure almost anything. But others sent long lists\r\nof questions calling for full and minute replies. Copies of these\r\nquestions and of her answers, she preserved.\r\n\r\nFrom her replies it would appear that there was hardly a bodily\r\nfunction which was not disturbed. She was subject to hard colds, to\r\nsevere headaches, a weak back, digestive trouble, and to periodic\r\nattacks of camp diarrhœa from which so many soldiers suffered for so\r\nmany years after the war, this condition alternating with stubborn\r\nconstipation.\r\n\r\nBut it is evident, as one reads critically these pathetic catechisms,\r\nthat she had after all a basis of sound physical health. Her careful\r\nanswers to these questions do not appear to indicate a single organic\r\ndisease. She had yet to learn that her back, which she thought so weak,\r\nwas really remarkably strong, and that her head had little need to ache\r\nwhen her eyes were not overstrained. And her digestion need not be\r\nseriously disturbed if her nerves were not worn and shattered.\r\n\r\nThe most serious symptom that Clara Barton had, through all these\r\nyears, was a temperament abnormally sensitive. She was capable of\r\nenduring almost any possible physical or nervous strain, and of\r\nstanding up under it well, but when the strain was over and she met\r\nsome trivial exhibition of ingratitude, some captious and wholly\r\nnegligible criticism, some petulant and despicable bit of opposition,\r\nher nervous energy gave way with a sudden collapse. Her voice failed;\r\nher eyes failed; whatever organ was weakest gave way first, and she\r\nwent to pieces like the deacon’s “one-hoss shay.”\r\n\r\nTo one who reads those letters at this distance, it seems a thousand\r\npities that some one, whose scientific judgment she could trust, did\r\nnot say to her: “You are organically sound. There is no good reason\r\nwhy you should be sick. You are tired, and that is not surprising. And\r\nyou have magnified innumerable foolish little matters of irritation.\r\nForget them. Believe that you are well. Half your years are yet before\r\nyou,--the better and happier and far the more useful half of your life.\r\nGet out in the fresh air. Live simply. Throw medicine away, and you can\r\nbe strong again.”\r\n\r\nIn an undated letter written in the early spring of 1876, she gives to\r\nMr. Dwight an account of her experience since her return to America:\r\n\r\n  [Undated. 1876, early spring]\r\n\r\n  DEAR MR. DWIGHT:\r\n\r\n I am at New England Village. Some good angel must have inspired you\r\n to write me. I was so anxious to hear of you, and only my physical\r\n weakness has kept me from commencing a search for you long ago. I had\r\n “somewhat” to say to you, as you know, and as soon as I am strong\r\n enough shall find a way to say it. Yes, it is true I am at New England\r\n Village and have been since last April.\r\n\r\n The “world” has not treated me badly in the last four years; but I\r\n could have better borne some bad treatment from others than all I have\r\n had to bear from myself. I have been an invalid most of the time.\r\n I grew very weak at Carlsruhe directly after Belfort, recovered a\r\n little, went to England in the spring of ’72, kept about some months,\r\n but in October broke down with a cough, became too ill to get off\r\n the island, was confined to my bed eight months; in June, ’73, was\r\n able to get over to Paris and recovered sufficiently to come home in\r\n October. My cough had left me, but I was weak, and fearing its return\r\n went to Washington as soon as I could for the winter, broke down again\r\n with “prostration of the nervous system,” if any one knows what that\r\n is, which was deepened and nearly rendered fatal by the illness of\r\n my only sister in Worcester, whom I strove for months to reach. Was\r\n finally brought to Worcester at the peril of my life on the 23d of\r\n May, ’74, arriving at 4 P.M. to find that she had died at 6 in the\r\n morning. I never saw her dead face even. It was one year from that\r\n time before I left the house again, and that to be removed here. I\r\n could not tell you the suffering, physical and mental, of that year,\r\n and I would not if I could. Only a small portion of the time could\r\n I stand alone; averaged less than two hours’ sleep in twenty-four\r\n for almost a year; could not write my name for over four months, and\r\n could not have a letter read to me or see my friends or scarcely my\r\n attendants. Little by little I have grown better until now I am about\r\n my house (for I always keep house). I have for attendant and nurse and\r\n housekeeper Miss Kupfer, of Berne, Suisse, a friend I made there, and\r\n who came to me as soon as she heard of my illness here a year or more\r\n ago and who never leaves me. I am gaining slowly, though weak still;\r\n have had neither physician nor medical treatment for over a year.\r\n Nature does her work as best she knows how; what measure of strength\r\n she may ever give me back I cannot know, probably not great. I suppose\r\n diseased nerve centers and worn-out systems are not likely to mend\r\n very firmly. But one day I shall want to see you, and you will let me\r\n do so, I think. If I am not able to go to Boston, you will come to see\r\n me, I believe, and when I see how it is likely to be with me I shall\r\n write and tell you. Meantime, it would interest me just as deeply to\r\n know how the world has treated you in these last few years as it does\r\n you to hear of me. Can I not know something of you and can I not send\r\n my most sincere and respectful regards to Mr. Jackson, whom I hope one\r\n day to see?\r\n\r\nWhile Clara Barton was touring New York State on her lecture tours, she\r\nspoke at Dansville, New York, and was entertained at the sanitarium,\r\npopularly spoken of as the water cure. On March 16, 1876, a lady from\r\nWorcester who had been a patient at Dansville called and spent the\r\ngreater part of a day with her. She told her that Dansville was “The\r\nplace to go and get well.” Miss Barton had resumed her diary, and she\r\nrecorded that this Miss Adams seemed to her “not an enthusiast, but a\r\ncalm, sensible girl; looks at things in the light of reason and common\r\nsense; and I feel that I can take her reports without discount, and her\r\nopinions on trust.”\r\n\r\nBefore many days she had practically determined to go to Dansville,\r\nand that place became her home for about ten years. At first she lived\r\nin the sanitarium; then she bought a home of her own. She adopted the\r\nsimple habits of life which there were inculcated. Little by little\r\nher strength returned, until, instead of being an invalid, she was\r\nfor her years a woman in remarkably good health. With the return of\r\nhealth came back her determination to establish the American Red Cross,\r\nand it was in Dansville that the first local organization in America\r\nwas established under that name. How she secured the organization and\r\nofficial recognition we shall presently learn. From her letters at this\r\ntime, two may be selected which give some account of the troubled years\r\nthrough which she had passed, and the great hope which she was now\r\nardently cherishing. One of these was addressed to the Public Printer\r\nat Washington, whose services she remembered kindly, and with whom she\r\nhoped to have dealings. The other was to her cherished friend, the\r\nGrand Duchess Louise of Baden.\r\n\r\n  DANSVILLE, Sept. 8, 1877\r\n\r\n  JOHN D. DE FRIEZE, ESQ.\r\n\r\n  Public Printer, Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n  DEAR AND ESTEEMED SIR:\r\n\r\n It occurs to me that it may not be entirely necessary to introduce\r\n myself to you. Even after a lapse of almost a decade you will not\r\n quite have forgotten that there was once a woman by the name of\r\n Clara Barton who, in common with the rest of the moving world, gave\r\n you more or less trouble. However faint these traces remain in your\r\n memory, that cannot dim the brightness which gilds her recollection\r\n of the uncounted favors you so kindly and generously meted out to her\r\n in the hard, busy days when she tried, with little strength and less\r\n power, to carry heavy burdens, and accomplish hard things. Through all\r\n these years the grateful memory of these kindnesses has never waned,\r\n and it so presses itself upon me that I cannot resist the desire to\r\n pick up my pen, far away in this quiet nook of the country, and tell\r\n you how glad I am, and have been, to know you are back again at your\r\n old post, which you ought never to have left, and how thankful I am\r\n to our _good President_ for having recalled you. My first impulse\r\n was to thank him directly, but unfortunately he does not know of my\r\n existence, and could never have found an excuse for my boldness, but\r\n you, my good and honored friend, will excuse it and will not call it\r\n even bold that a hard-worked woman has remembered the strong, kind\r\n hands that helped her on, and after long years has ventured to speak\r\n of it.\r\n\r\n Physically these intervening years have not been easy years for me,\r\n four of them with broken health and a wanderer in foreign lands, two\r\n of them in the Franco-Prussian War and its devastations, four more\r\n a helpless invalid in my own country, and this year for the first,\r\n once more on my feet walking about like other persons, but up to the\r\n present never leaving my home even for a short journey. I think of you\r\n all in that busy capital and wonder if it is true that I too was once\r\n a part of it, and stood erect amid its jostling and excitement. Thank\r\n God He has given you strength to endure to the end!\r\n\r\n Lest I give a wrong impression, let me add that it was _physically\r\n only_ that I referred to my life as hard. Socially and pecuniarily it\r\n is and has been easy and beautiful. I have all the world for friends\r\n and no unsatisfied wants, no necessities, no regrets except that I\r\n am not strong enough to do the work around me which the world needs\r\n to have done. Until now it has not in five long years dared ask of\r\n me the smallest service. Lately the European people have laid upon\r\n my hands an international matter pertaining to humanity for which\r\n it seems proper that I see the President. If I should be able to go\r\n to Washington for this purpose after his return, would you think it\r\n probable I could see and speak with him?\r\n\r\n I hope, Mr. De Freize, my long letter has not been too great a burden\r\n to you. If so, let it console you that it is not without its uses,\r\n for it is a great relief to me to have said a little of that which I\r\n wanted to say so much, and I beg to remain with the highest esteem,\r\n\r\n  Always gratefully your friend\r\n\r\n  CLARA BARTON\r\n\r\n\r\n  DANSVILLE, LIVINGSTON CO., N.Y.\r\n\r\n  May 19, 1877\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR GRAND DUCHESS:\r\n\r\n How shall I commence to write you after all these years of silence?\r\n Can it ever appear to you inexcusable? Will the generosity of your\r\n noble nature make you equal to the overlooking of an act which all\r\n the world, less noble and generous than yourself, would condemn\r\n as neglectful or forgetful? But, my preciously beloved friend, if\r\n these thoughts have ever taken hold upon your mind, and left their\r\n unpleasant shadow over the memory of your old-time friendship for me,\r\n and led you to feel that not only Republics, but their people as well,\r\n are _ungrateful_, and that you are only too happy in being relieved\r\n of such as you have known,--if all these dark thoughts and shadows\r\n lay there in your memory of me to-day, and I knew it, and knew also\r\n that they could only be removed by a full portrayal on my part of all\r\n the days and years of weakness, illness, suffering, and affliction\r\n which have caused the silence, I should hesitate long before I brought\r\n the picture to you; your active life and needed energies are not to\r\n be clogged and burdened by woes which do not belong to you, and the\r\n tax upon your sympathies is great enough from those who feel that\r\n they look rightfully to you for sympathy and help. Then let me say\r\n as little as possible of all this, and pass on to other things, and\r\n that little is, that during almost two years of the time since I last\r\n saw you in London, I have been not only too ill to write you, but\r\n too weak to have heard read a letter from you if it had been sent to\r\n me. You will understand from _theory_, and I pray the great and good\r\n God that you may _never_ know by _experience_, what helplessness and\r\n suffering may follow in the train of utter “prostration of the nervous\r\n system.” This was the misfortune that fell upon me directly upon my\r\n arrival in this country at the close of the year 1873, hastened and\r\n deepened by the death of my only sister whose life had been always\r\n dearer to me than my own. It was only last year, 1876, that I was able\r\n to leave my bed and learn to walk feebly about my room, sometimes see\r\n a friend, write a letter, and read my letters; then I was removed\r\n from my home in Massachusetts to this place, the largest and most\r\n noted water and rest cure in the country, where I have resided since,\r\n gradually regaining my strength, and coming back to life a little, but\r\n whether to _usefulness remains to be seen_. I have done everything to\r\n surround myself with healthful and strength-giving influences. The\r\n climate is delicious and I nearly live in the open air. Sleep, which\r\n in all years has been only a _visitor_, has come back to abide with\r\n me more constantly, and there is no night now in which it _quite_\r\n forsakes me. This was the great necessity, and I feel my strength\r\n returning under its blessed influence. My flesh is also returning\r\n and I am regaining some power of endurance. So far as any usefulness\r\n to others is concerned, I can see in all these years of helplessness\r\n only entire loss, but to myself I hope they may not have been without\r\n their uses and benefits. Through them I have walked narrower and\r\n darker paths than ever before, and stood very close to the dark still\r\n river. Aye, I have pitched my tents and rested there, waited calmly\r\n and sometimes, I fear, looked longingly over on to its other restful\r\n and brighter shore; but its shadows have not alarmed, its waters have\r\n not terrified. God has stood very near, my trust in Him has never\r\n faltered, and my faith has never wavered nor changed. I have known\r\n no fear, and if weakness, suffering, and inaction have made me more\r\n tender and thoughtful, it is well; if the silvery hair they have\r\n spread over temple and brow are a daily reminder that I have no longer\r\n the vigor of young strength, that, too, is well, and I will hope for\r\n added wisdom and gentler kindness.\r\n\r\n Now, my dear, this is all of me, but how is it with you and yours? For\r\n I have heard of you ill and suffering, and dared not ask more. I trust\r\n that is all past, and I should see only the bright, happy face that\r\n left its lovely picture on my memory. The noble husband, is he well?\r\n The beautiful “children”--I can scarcely picture them, for some of\r\n them are _men_ and _women_ now, and I never forget to pray God to keep\r\n and bless them all for the wife’s and mother’s sake. You will remember\r\n that the first great love in my heart for you carried me at one bound\r\n beyond all lines of courtly etiquette, blinded me to the positions and\r\n conditions of rank and royalty, and made me stupidly, awkwardly dumb\r\n to every titled phrase and courtly sentence; it closed and sealed my\r\n senses to all these, but opened them to the loving, tender wife and\r\n mother, the noble woman and the priceless friend. I could not have\r\n spoken a word of flattery to you sooner than I could have put it in my\r\n prayer; it could never have entered my thought to courtesy or bend the\r\n knee in your presence, but I should have lain in the dust at your feet\r\n without knowing it, if I had felt that it could serve you. A strange,\r\n uncourtly friend you have in me, this far-away American woman, my\r\n child, but a friend, nevertheless.\r\n\r\n And now comes up that dread theme that first brought me to know\r\n you--war, dreadful war. My heart has stood still for weeks in anxiety,\r\n fear, and dread. Is Germany, dear Germany, to be drawn into that\r\n terrible vortex? Are her mothers to give out their sons, and her wives\r\n their husbands again so soon? Are the graves to be opened again almost\r\n before they are green, and the wounds before they are healed? Are the\r\n fair fingers of her maidens again to ply the busy hours with bandages\r\n and lint and the trembling grandmothers to labor again with shirts\r\n and socks? And you and yours, who hold and guard the weal of all, are\r\n you to stand in jeopardy, and watch in agony again so soon? Are these\r\n dreadful days I so well remember all to be lived over again? I cannot\r\n yet believe it; neither can I yet rid me of the fear which haunts me\r\n day and night. Constantly the question rises, What _can I do_? And my\r\n weakness answers back, “Nothing, nothing.” If I had the strength of\r\n ten years ago, and the war opened upon you, I should prepare myself\r\n and go, not single-handed and alone, as I was overtaken in 1870, but\r\n I would make my arrangements with my people here for all material to\r\n work with, select my assistants from the German and German-speaking\r\n populations here, take my surgeons and nurses, and go at once and ask\r\n you for a field of labor. Surely you and your good husband and father\r\n and mother would assign me one somewhere! But it is all too late for\r\n this; at the best I can only use my influence and the little strength\r\n I have at home. As a means to this, I have written our good friend,\r\n Dr. Appia, of Geneva, to ask if any help from me would be desirable,\r\n and to say that if it would be acceptable, I would, upon his writing\r\n me to that effect, make the effort to establish an international\r\n organization in my own country for the collection and receipt of\r\n supplies, which should work under the insignia of the Red Cross, and\r\n forward through a headquarters which I would attempt to establish\r\n somewhere near or at New York. Thus would I try to bring the early\r\n and organized efforts of America into direct communication with the\r\n activities of Europe, and try for once to make our charities of some\r\n timely and real benefit, which the great distance and want of proper\r\n organization has hitherto greatly hindered, or nearly prevented. Our\r\n people are generous, tender of heart, and quick in their sympathies,\r\n but they are busy and spread over a quarter of the globe. They do\r\n not become aware of the necessities for assistance in other lands\r\n till great suffering exists and the general Press brings it to their\r\n knowledge. Then they spring with a bound of sympathy and generosity\r\n and give without stint, but their stream has no channel prepared for\r\n it to flow in and runs over and wastes, so that little, very little,\r\n ever reaches the real scene of suffering and want for which it is so\r\n generously given. If I can learn that it would be acceptable and that\r\n there can be established a direct coöperation between the charitable\r\n activities of America and Europe, and that Europe _desires it_, I\r\n shall do all in my power to organize the work early, at _once_ in\r\n America. It is for this I have written Dr. Appia to have him send\r\n me his _request_ that I would do it, that I may use it as a lever\r\n with our Government to gain its sanction, protection, prestige, and\r\n coöperation so far as I can. I shall watch with all interest every\r\n movement and I would be so grateful for any information that I might\r\n gain from European sources regarding the true condition of things. How\r\n glad I should be of any published work or matter, if any exists, which\r\n explains the working of _your_ remarkable system of, or what we term,\r\n “Relief Societies.” I do not know where to send for this but to _you_\r\n who were the originator and head. If the condition of Europe renders\r\n it desirable, and I am strong enough to organize aid in America,\r\n every word of information on these points would be held priceless.\r\n I am gleaning all I can from such foreign papers as I can get; both\r\n the German and French languages are familiarly used in my house. My\r\n amanuensis is Swiss and speaks both natively, of course. The more I\r\n read, the more I fear what the next months may bring to you, to dear\r\n Germany and to all Europe. And the more I fear, the more anxious I am\r\n to help. Let us pray God the storm may pass, but if it must come, give\r\n us strength and wisdom to meet it well.\r\n\r\n I have long been the debtor of good Madame de Mentzinger, and my next\r\n European letter will be to her, who I hope will forgive my delay. I\r\n was not able to answer her in time. To our dear Hannah I have not\r\n written in years, nor heard. I know the parent family is nearly gone,\r\n and that she has one of her own. I shall hope to hear of her some\r\n day,--the precious child!\r\n\r\n And dear Princess Wilhelm, who seems to me always to be a part of\r\n yourself, may I dare send my love through you to her? I remember once\r\n she graciously told me I might write her. I wonder if the privilege\r\n still exists, or has time annulled it? I know she has had her griefs\r\n and that her precious mother has gone home.\r\n\r\n All that happens to you there in that beloved Court circle is\r\n reflected and felt here in my distant home as if it were a part of\r\n it. I joy in your prosperity and sorrow for your griefs as if in some\r\n way they belonged to me or mine. I could not if I attempted to divest\r\n myself of this interest. I even could not help feeling a solicitous\r\n interest in all that pertained to Prince Alexis in his recent visit\r\n to my country, and rejoiced with a kind of motherly pride in all the\r\n good impressions he made, and felt that I ought to see him, because\r\n he was of your house, and the home cousin of dear Princess Wilhelm.\r\n He, the gallant, princely man, would have laughed at the idea of a\r\n plain, unpretending American woman cherishing a family pride in him\r\n and keeping a motherly watchfulness for his welfare, but your love and\r\n kindness to me when a stranger in your country won my gratitude and\r\n love forever for all that pertains to you. I have followed the late\r\n journeying and visits of your noble father with wonder and joy for\r\n his continued vigor. I so well remember the tender care and love that\r\n dwelt in my heart for my honored father when fourscore winters had\r\n whitened his locks and bared his brow, yet his firm marching step told\r\n not more than fifty summers, and his eye was still clear and his voice\r\n strong; but he left me, the brave old soldier.\r\n\r\n I always regret that I never saw your honored mother, and it was my\r\n purpose not to have left Europe without this distinguished pleasure.\r\n But her precious gift, the beautiful cross, is the chiefest among my\r\n treasures, lying always beside yours. You cannot conceive, I am sure,\r\n _how_ precious those gifts are to me, and do you recollect the sweet\r\n picture of yourself you once sent me for a Christmas gift? It has\r\n comforted me every day through all these suffering years, always near\r\n my bed. It was the first to greet me in the morning, and now, in these\r\n days of better strength and activity, it is no less the admiration of\r\n my friends than it has been the companion of my weakness.\r\n\r\n But I must somewhere make an end to this seemingly endless letter, and\r\n with one thought more I will.\r\n\r\n May I entreat you that, if disturbances and war come upon you, and\r\n there arises any contingency, any want, any point upon which it may\r\n seem that I could, being here, be of the smallest or largest use to\r\n you, or your people, you will not hesitate a moment in making any use\r\n of me that you possibly can; consult with me upon any plan (that it\r\n shall be strictly confidential I need not add) and it will be always\r\n possible for me to confer directly with the head or heads of our\r\n Government, and so far as I can I will influence our people to any\r\n charitable activities or movements which might be desired and which\r\n you kindly suggest to me. How glad I should be to feel myself once\r\n more working with you, that I was perhaps helping you a little, and\r\n the American people would be glad, for you are no stranger to them,\r\n and I want them to know you better still. I pray you let\r\n\r\n  Your grateful and loving friend\r\n\r\n  CLARA BARTON\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat she found at Dansville that restored her health is shown in some\r\nof her home letters. She found congenial society, wholesome and simple\r\nfood, and an atmosphere that believed health to be possible. The world\r\nis moderately full of sick and half-sick people who could be well if\r\nthey knew how, and would believe that they were well.\r\n\r\nShe grew strong enough for short tours to neighboring cities. She\r\nbecame a star performer in the evening entertainments in the\r\nsanitarium, reciting poetry, sometimes writing a poem for a special\r\noccasion, and after a time giving a short lecture about her experiences\r\nabroad. A few of her letters will show her state of health and of mind.\r\nThere was nothing miraculous or sudden about her recovery. She had\r\nperiods of depression and times of weakness, but she gained strength\r\nand gained it permanently, and was able to take up the greatest work of\r\nher life and carry it through triumphantly.\r\n\r\n  “OUR HOME ON THE HILLSIDE”\r\n  DANSVILLE, LIVINGSTON CO., N.Y.\r\n  July 15, 1876\r\n\r\n  DEAR COZ:\r\n\r\n If Miss Kupfer had not written me that _she_ had written to you since\r\n our departure, I should have written earlier, but I knew she had told\r\n you of our safe arrival, and I thought I had then nothing of interest\r\n to say until I could tell you how I liked my surroundings. I have now\r\n been here seven weeks and find no occasion to regret coming. The place\r\n is simply beautiful in its location and surroundings, made up of hills\r\n and valleys under a high state of cultivation and taste.\r\n\r\n The institution is larger and more flourishing than I had expected,\r\n with about three hundred patients, or persons _as_ patients, and\r\n I think I never saw together any group of people that combines\r\n the degrees of intellect, general intelligence, and culture as\r\n is collected here. The speech of every person one meets is kind,\r\n charitable, and refined.\r\n\r\n The faculty connected with the institution is, I should judge,\r\n skillful and competent, but the general means for promoting health\r\n through proper food, water, bathing, dress, rest, sunshine, open\r\n air, and pleasant surroundings are mainly relied upon; little or no\r\n medicines are ever used. I have neither seen nor heard of any being\r\n used by any person since I have been here; indeed, the great struggle\r\n and effort seems to be to get _out_ of the patients the remnants of\r\n the medicines already taken in the past.\r\n\r\n We have several excellent lectures in the hall during the week and\r\n services on the Sabbath. The Hall is so situated that all can attend.\r\n No change or addition of dress required, more than to go from one room\r\n to another. If one is not able to walk, he is carried if he chooses to\r\n be, and if one does not wish to sit up, he lies down and listens, so\r\n there is no getting weary, no exhaustion, no getting over-tired. One\r\n gets all the good without the bad.\r\n\r\n The tables are _excellent_ and most abundantly supplied. Meats plainly\r\n but well cooked, the freshest of vegetables from their own gardens,\r\n and such abundance of fruit as I never saw, all in its turn. We have\r\n passed through the era of strawberries and cherries and currants,\r\n and are now in the raspberries, white, red, and black. I believe\r\n the blackberries follow next, and so on to the peaches, pears, and\r\n apples of autumn, but the astonishing thing after their freshness and\r\n perfection is their abundance. They are not served to us in saucers,\r\n or on individual plates, but placed in large fruit dishes once in\r\n about three feet through all the scores of tables, each one to help\r\n himself over and over, the dishes being refilled to the last, and we\r\n _leaving_ the tables filled as we _find_ them. The fruit is mainly\r\n picked from the gardens that day for dinner, or the evening before for\r\n breakfast, from two hundred to four hundred quarts for a meal. Besides\r\n this we have always the greatest abundance of “Shaker” dried fruits\r\n cooked for those who cannot take the fresh. New milk from their own\r\n dairy (they have forty or fifty cows), all one can use at every meal;\r\n the freshest of oatmeals and grahams, sweet butter, tapioca, etc. The\r\n vegetables are largely cooked in milk, and harmless. With all these\r\n fruits and vegetables there is no summer complaint here. I have not\r\n heard of a case, and among all these invalid people not a person in\r\n bed, except a few rheumatics who were brought here in beds and are not\r\n up yet. No fevers, no colics, but all out and about in the sunshine,\r\n and on the Hillside’s stretchers and hammocks under the trees. One has\r\n only to be lazy and jolly and get well if they can.\r\n\r\n There are a good many very pretty cottages outside the Main Institute\r\n where persons room, but all meet in the same dining-hall, and in\r\n the same parlor for prayers and singing after breakfast and the\r\n distribution of the mail after dinner. _I_ am in the Institute, or\r\n main building. The views from the verandas are as fine as many I\r\n have heard extolled in foreign countries. A single glance takes in a\r\n stretch of the valley of over ten miles in length, as handsome as a\r\n landscape garden. We are so high above the town that we seldom walk,\r\n but there are always livery teams waiting orders at the door. One\r\n drives or is driven as the choice may be. Dr. Jackson has a stable of\r\n about twelve horses for his and family uses and the work. They are\r\n handsome enough for a _fair_, and I occasionally find that they are\r\n good roadsters. The village below us is pretty and thriving.\r\n\r\n Miss Atwater lives in the village about a mile from me, but comes\r\n to lectures. She is well and seems very happy. I have ridden down\r\n to see her a few times. Her uncle is still with her. He had worked\r\n hard in his hotels for a great many years, been broken of his rest a\r\n great deal, and was considerably worn down, and seems to be glad of\r\n an opportunity to rest a little outside of a hot city. It makes it\r\n pleasant for Fanny till she gets more acquainted, but the people are\r\n very kind and social here. There is no stiffness.\r\n\r\n There are something like fifty people employed as _help_ to do the\r\n work of this Home, but not _one servant_; the word, nor position is\r\n not known here, all are treated equally, all ladylike and gentlemanly,\r\n all treated alike. There is an amusement society, and one of its\r\n features is a beautiful dance once a week from 5 till 8 P.M. Piano and\r\n violin music,--no round dances,--but cotillions and all dances which\r\n are _not injurious_, and the prettiest and most elegant dancers in the\r\n hall are from among the help.\r\n\r\n There is a regularly organized fire company on the grounds, and\r\n the houses are watched and patrolled all night like a first-class\r\n manufactory. No doors are ever locked; all stand open if not too cold.\r\n I have never turned a key in the house. Now, I believe I have told you\r\n all the most important features of the place I have come to, but I\r\n have been very careful not to overdraw it, for I _hope_ some of your\r\n journeys may sometime bring you to take a look at it for yourself, and\r\n I would not like you to be disappointed.\r\n\r\n I hope this severely hot weather has not been too much for you, and\r\n that sometime you will find time to drop a line to your\r\n\r\n  Affectionate Coz\r\n\r\n  CLARA\r\n\r\n I neglected to say that I find a good many old friends here. Our\r\n chaplain was a member of the Sanitary Commission in Washington, and\r\n the Reverend Dr. Abbott, who is here with his family, was President of\r\n the Christian Commission. Love to any who may inquire.\r\n\r\n  CLINTON HOTEL, ROCHESTER\r\n  Sunday [1876]\r\n\r\n  DEAREST MAMIE:\r\n\r\n Does the date take you by surprise? Don’t be alarmed, it’s all right.\r\n I am only on a visit of a few days. Dr. Jackson, Miss Austin, and\r\n several other lady friends made a party and came last Friday to stay\r\n several days in Rochester, and enjoy the change and rest, and here\r\n we are having a glorious time. All but I can go to operas, church,\r\n lectures, galleries, etc., etc., and I can stay by and keep guard\r\n and direct the servants how to order the rooms, to have all ready\r\n and jolly for them when they get back. Mrs. Jones, principal of the\r\n Dansville Seminary, and a Miss Reynolds, who is “Thirza Ann” in a\r\n Betsey Bobbet Club we have here and a capital dramatist, are my room\r\n companions in the hotel. There is no lack of fun with two such fertile\r\n brains about. We go home next Tuesday.\r\n\r\n Now that I am through with myself, let me turn to you and say how glad\r\n I am that you have been to the Centennial and enjoyed it so well, made\r\n so much of it, and got home so well. What a beautiful gift that was\r\n from Mr. and Mrs. Shrubler, to you, that trip, a hundred-fold more\r\n than the beautiful dress which was a thing to be most grateful for,\r\n but it will wear out in time, while nothing short of eternity can take\r\n from you the knowledge and benefits of that exhibition. It is a thing\r\n for a lifetime, not only its pleasure but its profits. Please thank\r\n them both for me for this thoughtful courtesy to you and for the good\r\n dress also, and indeed for all their kindnesses to my little girl, who\r\n I know is grateful for herself, but I am also grateful for her.\r\n\r\n Now, you see I have not your letter here and cannot answer it as I\r\n ought, for I really do not recollect the questions it asks, neither\r\n do I recollect when I wrote you last, or what I told you then, so\r\n this letter is liable to be a repetition or an omission, but you will\r\n forgive this in either of the circumstances. I had a good letter from\r\n Ida just an hour before I started from Dansville and have answered it\r\n from there. She is a very easy, natural correspondent and would make\r\n a fine writer in some special directions if she could be cultivated.\r\n She sends me advertisement of your Papa D.’s farm. I was a little\r\n surprised at this, but it shows him in earnest in his assertion that\r\n he would like to be rid of it, and I do not wonder that he feels it\r\n a burden. It is more so than if it were larger and would afford more\r\n and efficient help, and pay for outlays. I consider it one of the most\r\n laborious sizes that a farm can have if one intends to use it as a\r\n farm, and if not, then it is too large. Four acres of nice buildings\r\n would really be worth more in the way of comfort, and these buildings\r\n have got to an age which will call for constant repairs, and the house\r\n is never convenient nor built for a farmhouse; in fact it was not\r\n intended for a farm by Grandpa, and there was no farm till your father\r\n made it so by his cultivation, for it was waste land.\r\n\r\n Did I tell you that the Taylors had sailed for England? They must be\r\n there now. How sweet and beautiful they were when here, and how in the\r\n two or three little days they spent here they made themselves felt\r\n and beloved. Mrs. Taylor is really one of the sweetest women I have\r\n ever known. Fannie is at the Centennial and I have just one line from\r\n her. She is almost frantic from the confusion. You know her head gets\r\n troubled easily, and she had not got it rested from the journey and\r\n the first days of the great show. She will remain long enough to find\r\n herself and look clearly and see what she “went for to see,” I trust.\r\n I am glad you have heard from Etta and glad they are getting on so\r\n well. Please give a great deal of love to dear Anna and congratulate\r\n her on her Centennial trip which, I trust, she enjoyed to its fullest,\r\n and thank Mr. Shrubler for his good gift to my dear old brother. I\r\n know it has made a warm spot in his heart for all the time he will\r\n live to wear it, and with his poor health and tendency to melancholy\r\n his joys are not too many. Mr. Shrubler has given him a great many\r\n pleasures, and I thank him most earnestly for them all.\r\n\r\n My kitty is charming. She knows almost as much as folks, and has just\r\n taken to mousing. She often carries in two and three and sometimes\r\n four and five bits of game a day, and all the family have to recognize\r\n each one before she will be at all quiet. She is too comical, standing\r\n at the door with her nice white face and her mouth full of mouse and\r\n grass, calling all the household out to see her.\r\n\r\n  Yours lovingly\r\n\r\n  CLARA\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Barton’s views on health, on politics, on society, on idle women,\r\nand incidentally, perhaps, her best description of herself, her tastes\r\nand habits, is contained in a letter of this period to a learned German\r\nprofessor, who, knowing of her life in Germany, wrote to her, and\r\nproposed to visit her. It is interesting to note that in this letter\r\nshe speaks of her hair as having been dark brown and changed in a few\r\nmonths of illness to a silvery gray. It did not remain gray, but with\r\nher return of health resumed its color of brown, though not so dark as\r\nbefore:\r\n\r\n  DANSVILLE, LIVINGSTON CO., N.Y.\r\n\r\n  April 17, 1877\r\n\r\n  ESTEEMED AND DEAR FRIEND:\r\n\r\n I beg you not to be alarmed even if you were correct in your\r\n conjecture that illness caused my silence. It is very true, but I am\r\n so far recovered now that, although not released from my bed, I have\r\n taken up my pen again, and yesterday, before receiving your card,\r\n had laid out your last letter as one of the first to be answered. I\r\n might, or I might not, have reached it to-day in regular order, but\r\n now, I place it first, and commence my morning roll-call with “Prof.\r\n Thed. Pfau,” and a long, narrow, blue-tinted envelope responds, half\r\n wearily, half impatiently, “_Here_.” So “here” we have it.\r\n\r\n First, having _admitted_ illness, which I never do if possible to\r\n avoid, I must settle your apprehensiveness; it is no new play, or act\r\n or scene, simply a calling before the curtain for repetition. I have\r\n in these exhausted days only a given amount of strength, and if, by\r\n any accident or oversight, I overdraw on my accounts, I am at once\r\n bankrupt, and can carry on business no further. Having been in former\r\n days accustomed to draw from an unlimited and ever-recruiting stock of\r\n strength and health, I find it a difficult problem to solve, how to\r\n bring myself down to the necessary economies of my present condition.\r\n I cannot realize that a few hours, a few rods, a few steps even, a\r\n little overwork at my desk, the quiet arranging of a simple room, a\r\n little overrun of company, may use up all my little capital, and I\r\n must wait and compromise with my creditors, start business anew on a\r\n smaller scale, and work my way up again to the lost point, probably\r\n only to lose it again. A month or six weeks ago I committed some\r\n one of these extravagances, and immediately comes a notice from my\r\n physical banker shutting off my supply of sleep. He had been allowing\r\n me nearly seven hours in the four and twenty, but he cut it down\r\n to three, two, one, a few minutes, none at all, and so left me for\r\n several days and nights, then let it come back in a similar ratio up\r\n to--Oh, well, no matter how much, but not _seven hours_, no, nor for\r\n a long time to come; but I can get up and walk about my room and sit\r\n part of the day; and I write, because it is better for me to write\r\n chatty letters, with no thought in them, than to relapse into solid\r\n thinking as I would in doing nothing. One sometimes needs to be saved\r\n from himself.\r\n\r\n I do not know if I have ever told you of my illness, or what holds\r\n me so weak. It is what is known as “prostration of the nervous\r\n system,” and very complete at that, I suppose. I am not aware of\r\n any decided organic disease, only as all the organs are affected by\r\n this great letting down of nerve power and force. Of the class of\r\n disease generally denominated “female weaknesses” I know nothing\r\n experimentally. Of the lame backs and aching _lower_ spine, that the\r\n majority of feeble women suffer torture from, I am ignorant, and\r\n can sympathize with them only through observation, but of the _hot_\r\n sore spot on the spine, high up between the shoulders, leading up to\r\n the base of the brain, bursting into flame at every over-taxation\r\n of mental energy, I know all. It is the same thing that over-worked\r\n public men sink under, in sudden deaths, softening of the brain,\r\n paralysis, or something analogous to these. This is the illness that\r\n has become my master and will one day prove my conqueror. There is\r\n no looking forward to “restored health,” soundness and _security_.\r\n The price of not only my liberty, but my life is “eternal vigilance.”\r\n Now a truce to illness, to which, thank God, you are a comparative\r\n stranger, and I pray Him you always may be.\r\n\r\n I have received “Puck” since his advent into this warring world, and\r\n he is growing to be a fine little fellow, stout and healthy, a jolly\r\n little elf, isn’t he? His _wit_ will get him some clips over the nose\r\n by and by, when it begins to be felt, but this he does not care for,\r\n for he _means_ to bite. I laughed heartily at his satire on Stanley\r\n two weeks ago, and yet Stanley is a valued friend, and I have fought\r\n terrible battles for him on both continents, but the imitation is\r\n excellent and full of ingenuity. The cuts are, of course, inimitable.\r\n Mr. Kepler’s pencil has a master touch, and I wish him long life,\r\n abundant success, full pockets, and artistic fame.\r\n\r\n The spring is opening well here. We have had a succession of charming\r\n days, followed now by a rain which is bringing up the green grass\r\n and swelling the buds almost to bursting, but we have no leaves yet.\r\n Some wild trees which precede their leaf life by their flowers are\r\n out in spring dress; a kind of woods willow, which bedecks itself in\r\n deep yellow, is very gaudy just now; the peach trees are pushing out\r\n their little soft gray pussy toes all over their red branches, and the\r\n horse-chestnuts, with their blunt ends tipped with swollen round buds,\r\n look as if they had doubled up their fists for fighting and said to\r\n all their more tapering, slender neighbors, Come on, we are ready! We\r\n are yet a month too early for the first roses.\r\n\r\n Perhaps I told you that I removed to a snug brick city-built house\r\n for the winter. I have changed it this spring for a much older and\r\n country-like wood house, which has some trees, grass, and shade, a\r\n garden, and _perhaps_ some flowers if the sunshine brings them up.\r\n I am, of course, all too unpretending and simple in my life to have\r\n a gardener, so shall lack the beauties which such assistance would\r\n develop. I was once a very tolerable gardener myself among flowers,\r\n but I have no longer strength to spend on the strong lap of Mother\r\n Earth, much as I love her and her dear little nurslings of cowslip and\r\n violets, but good sturdy old dame, she does a great deal without help,\r\n and knows very well how to dress herself without the aid of a _fille\r\n de chambre_.\r\n\r\n But here I am on this fourth large page, and not even yet noted the\r\n contents of your letter. The photograph! I am sorry that you withheld\r\n it, I should have been very glad to receive it, if you would entrust\r\n it to me, and I still hope you will decide to do so. I should prize\r\n it, but I cannot say when I should be able to return the favor. I\r\n have no photographs either good or bad. I am never able to go to a\r\n gallery to sit for one. The last time was in Paris. All I ever had\r\n have been picked away long ago. I am the debtor of all my friends for\r\n pictures, some of them several times over, but they know how it is,\r\n and I hope excuse me. If I should ever again be in condition to sit,\r\n and can get a result that my friends will accept, I will take them\r\n by the hundred and relieve myself from embarrassment, but you should\r\n know that as a _picture_ my photograph is not at all to be coveted. If\r\n natural, it must be uncomely. I was _never_ what the world calls even\r\n “good-looking,” leaving out of the case all such terms as “handsome,”\r\n and “pretty.” My features were strong and square, cheek-bones\r\n high, mouth large, complexion dark; my best feature was perhaps a\r\n luxuriant growth of glossy dark hair shading to blackness, but that\r\n is comparatively thin now, and silver gray, all within the last three\r\n years. It changed from its original blackness to its present shade in\r\n the first six weeks of this present illness in 1874. I never cared\r\n for dress, and have no accomplishments, so you will find me plain and\r\n prosy both in representation and reality if ever you should chance to\r\n meet either. I beg you to _believe_ this and to _remember_ it to avoid\r\n any disappointment which might possibly occur. Not that I think it\r\n could change the friendship of a sensible person, but I like people,\r\n and especially my friends, to know me as I am, and not hold a false\r\n estimate of me.\r\n\r\n Of poor Miss R. (Lorraine Raymond) I never hear a word. It is\r\n charitable to attribute her silence to want of scholarship, but I am\r\n inclined to disbelieve the verity of this. I believe her to be a very\r\n fair scholar, and an average (to say the least of it) correspondent;\r\n but she seldom writes, I know. She wrote me a few letters from Europe\r\n _years_ ago, none of late years. She has a kind heart, and I am so\r\n _so_ sorry for her.\r\n\r\n I hope the trial of your brother will not result disastrously to him.\r\n Perhaps one cannot easily control a dislike, but he has certainly\r\n chosen a most powerful foe, and the odds _seem_ unequal. I agree with\r\n you in more than word, when you declare the Imperial Family of Germany\r\n to be a _respectable one_; it is all of that, nothing in Europe stands\r\n before it, and those of it whom I have known personally are of the\r\n highest excellence and purest worth. I am sure the more intimately\r\n they are known, the better they must be beloved. The Grand Duchess\r\n of Baden is to _me_ the loveliest woman on the earth; in this term I\r\n mean to combine all qualities of both mind and body; both nature and\r\n culture have made her a _Princess_. And I cannot see why she is not\r\n as good a Republican as if she had been born a peasant, or a Suisse,\r\n or American citizen; in no position would she knowingly do a wrong or\r\n commit an act of tyranny to the lowest human being whether subject\r\n or not. “Tired of Republics,” you say. Perhaps if you study your own\r\n meaning closely you will find that you are rather tired of politics\r\n than Republics. And, my esteemed and valued friend, let me in all\r\n childlike simplicity suggest what does not perhaps clearly appear to\r\n you, viz., that the standpoint one occupies, the surroundings one\r\n has, the outlook one takes, have a great deal to do in forming the\r\n opinion and swaying the judgment. I am sorry that you must perforce\r\n see our country, its political, moral, and social sides, through the\r\n slum, and mire, and haze of a lens like New York City. Out on our\r\n millions of acres of hills, valleys, and plains is a better, purer,\r\n nobler population, the force of whose earnestness and honesty will\r\n save our Nation long ages after the pollution of its cities would\r\n have turned it into a Sodom and Gomorrah. There is a true, steady,\r\n honest pulse beating in the veins of the yeomanry of this land that\r\n never throbbed a second in a city like New York, and never will; but\r\n when the trial comes, _it is the pulse that will tell_. Tweed and his\r\n “ring” didn’t go to the farmers sweating in their hay-fields with\r\n their _bargains_. They went to the politicians, and burrowed in the\r\n cities and made their nests like the bats and owls, under the eaves of\r\n churches and in halls and steeples; they can plan, and connive, and\r\n twiddle and fiddle with the lines a long time while the farmers work\r\n in their fields, but when real danger appears, when the load topples\r\n and is likely to upset, stouter hearts than theirs will come to the\r\n front, stronger hands than theirs will take the reins, and bring out\r\n the load in safety. We are not so near destruction as it would seem\r\n from _your_ standpoint, and because a few poor, vain, foolish women,\r\n with little money and less brains and shriveled hearts, have betaken\r\n themselves to the boarding-houses of New York City, and are living\r\n false, empty, silly, idle lives for _show_, it does not make it that\r\n this is the character or life of _all_ the women of America, nor that\r\n well-regulated _homelife_ is not the rule of the country, _for it is_;\r\n and I, who am a part of it, and have lived it, and over and among it,\r\n all my lifetime, know it _well_. Shall we judge France and its whole\r\n people by the courtesans of Paris, or Germany by Berlin? Oh! my friend\r\n and brother, do, I beseech of you, get another standpoint, and a wider\r\n outlook and a clearer, purer atmosphere than New York City with its\r\n floodtide of immigration before you judge, in final judgment, the\r\n whole population, male and female, of this great country.\r\n\r\n I thank you very much for the hope expressed that we may meet in\r\n Paris in ’78, but there is small prospect of this. I shall scarcely\r\n cross the ocean again. I have much to do to save my strength with no\r\n unnecessary waste, but the hope expressed that we may meet before\r\n that time is something nearer home, and more within the range of\r\n _possibilities_. I should never dare by any means to invite you to\r\n visit me, and I never go to your part of the country, so the prospect\r\n of our meeting is small. Perhaps I ought to explain the above remark,\r\n having very incautiously made it, and I will. I am a so much more\r\n simple person in my mode of life than you have probably ever seen\r\n (except those whom poverty compelled to simplicity) that you would\r\n not feel happy or homelike in my house. I am simple in my tastes,\r\n and plain, avoiding luxuries from choice and _principle_, both\r\n about my house and in its dress, and my table and its furnishings.\r\n My living is simple as a hermit’s, heavy meats, and wines, teas,\r\n and coffees are unknown at my table, my rooms plain. I have only my\r\n housekeeper--no retinue of servants at all, no show, no ornaments, no\r\n excuses; but with all this there is great peace and quiet, no worry,\r\n no fret, no fears of what the world will think or say, no pressure in\r\n any direction, abundant supplies for all _necessities_, no scandal\r\n either spoken or listened to, no backbiting, and no “skeleton in the\r\n closet,” not even the _shadow_ of one. Now, all this simplicity and\r\n plainness, and the absence of excitement and luxurious surroundings\r\n and living, must be so different from all that you are accustomed to\r\n that you could not be happy or even comfortable among it, so I should\r\n never _dare_ invite you to visit me, even if you were journeying near\r\n me, and so, when you see that I do not, you will understand the true\r\n reason and assign the right motive on my part and not feel piqued or\r\n slighted, or that I am cold, or eccentric, or reserved, or in any way\r\n unaccountable, or any other thing, but just _what I am_, a plain\r\n woman with enough of common sense to perceive that our modes of life\r\n are so different that you could not enjoy visiting me, and fearless\r\n candor enough to tell you so.\r\n\r\n  Your sincere friend\r\n\r\n  CLARA BARTON\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Clara Barton was regarded at Dansville is shown in many ways, as in\r\nthe following cutting from the Dansville “Advertiser” of June 7, 1877,\r\ngiving account of an exercise on the previous Memorial Day:\r\n\r\n OVATION TO MISS CLARA BARTON\r\n\r\n Toward noon on Memorial Day the bustle of preparation to go downtown\r\n to the procession and oration seemed to arouse a new impulse of\r\n gratitude to the soldiers’ friend, Miss Clara Barton, which spread\r\n rapidly through Our Home, and soon organized itself in a programme of\r\n proceedings for the evening, when she should have rested a little from\r\n the fatigue of her participation in the public celebration.\r\n\r\n By six o’clock a goodly number of men and women and children had\r\n gathered in Brightside and on the surrounding lawn. Soon this company,\r\n consisting of doctors and other officials, the stronger patients and\r\n helpers from the Cure, a few near-by neighbors, and the inmates of\r\n Brightside, were marshaled two by two on the walk before the gate.\r\n Of the hundred nosegays which the girls had hastily tied up and\r\n heaped on a server, none were left when each person had taken one;\r\n and these, with numerous “flags a-floating,” made the procession gay\r\n as it moved on, led by the clergy. The Conesus brass band, taking\r\n tea at the seminary, had patriotically agreed to add to the dignity\r\n of the enterprise by their numbers and their music. Meanwhile one of\r\n the company had casually (apparently) in a neighborly way dropped\r\n into Miss Barton’s parlor, and lured her on to the front piazza in\r\n time to witness the approach as the allies joined their forces. Being\r\n entirely taken by surprise, she could only exclaim to her attendant,\r\n “What does it all mean? What shall I do?” when she saw the battalion\r\n bearing down--rather up--on her castle. Evidently she was completely\r\n subjugated without a gun being fired, and looked helplessly and\r\n speechlessly around on the lines of exultant faces which, filing\r\n right and left, had environed the piazza in a semicircle. It still\r\n required some gentle force, however, to seat her on the chair in\r\n readiness for her. At this juncture Miss Austin, stepping forward,\r\n said:\r\n\r\n MISS BARTON: After joining our sympathies with our fellow citizens at\r\n large in paying a tribute of respect and gratitude to the brave men\r\n who fought and suffered and died for their country’s salvation, the\r\n inmates of Our Home come with gladness to greet a _living woman_--one\r\n who worked and suffered and gave her strength and health in\r\n alleviating the pains and sorrows, the homesickness and heart-sickness\r\n of our soldiers. And we are thankful that your mission was not alone\r\n to _our_ soldiers, but that you represented a vastly broader and\r\n nobler sentiment than mere patriotism--that you were actuated by that\r\n grand humanity which forbade you even in war-times to know any North\r\n or any South; but that every man to whom you could in any way minister\r\n was your brother. We rejoice in this, because you then represented the\r\n selfsame spirit which must yet bridge over the chasm that has hitherto\r\n divided the two sections and make us one united brotherhood--a happy\r\n and prosperous country.\r\n\r\n But, dear Miss Barton, your life and labors have carried you beyond\r\n _our country_, and through you we hold fraternal bonds to the whole\r\n world. In foreign countries and in a foreign war, you spent your\r\n sympathies and your efforts, not on the Germans, nor on the French,\r\n nor on any nationality; but everywhere, every man, every woman, every\r\n little child who needed help or loving succor, received these from you\r\n in the full measure of your capacity to bestow.\r\n\r\n We come, then, to lay our honors at your feet as a citizen of the\r\n world, as a friend to humanity, as a lover of your race; recognizing\r\n the work which you have done as a foreshadowing of that time when\r\n men shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into\r\n pruning hooks, when nations shall not lift up sword against nations,\r\n neither shall they learn war any more.\r\n\r\nMiss Austin then introduced Reverend Miss Anna Oliver, of Passaic, New\r\nJersey, who said:\r\n\r\n The feeling of enthusiastic admiration with which I have long regarded\r\n one whose course has reflected honor upon her country, upon womanhood\r\n and humanity, prevent me from making a set speech on this occasion.\r\n\r\n Several years ago I had the pleasure, Miss Barton,--I may say the sad\r\n pleasure,--of visiting Andersonville Prison, and the cemetery laid\r\n out under your supervision, placing a flower on each of those several\r\n thousand graves. During that visit through the South, I frequently\r\n heard the name of Miss Barton mentioned with gratitude and love, both\r\n by those who had served in the Confederate and in the Union armies.\r\n\r\n War is terrible, and we all know, of course, that no such thing as\r\n a necessary war ever occurred. But as long as wars are actualities,\r\n how blessed is the thought that the barbarities of past ages may be\r\n superseded by the gentle Christian ministrations, a representative of\r\n which we delight to honor to-day.\r\n\r\n  We mourn the fratricidal strife\r\n    That digs each soldier’s grave;\r\n  We strew the flowers on the sod\r\n    In honor of the brave;\r\n  But most of all we rev’rence those\r\n    Who seek man’s life to save.\r\n\r\n  They marched on the advancing foe\r\n    They nobly fought and fell;\r\n  But there were those attending near,\r\n    ’Mid shower of shot and shell,\r\n  As brave in a diviner cause,\r\n    Who did their part as well.\r\n\r\n To-day we pay our tribute of respect to the names of Florence\r\n Nightingale and Clara Barton.\r\n\r\nDr. Jackson then, being called by Miss Barton to her aid, thanked her\r\nfriends in her behalf and happily expressed what he imagined might be\r\nher feelings on the occasion. When he had finished, the “Star-Spangled\r\nBanner” was sung by the choir.\r\n\r\nMiss Barton now spoke briefly and feelingly of the honor done her and\r\nthe happy memory to be cherished. Sometime she might express herself\r\nbetter. The most she could do now was simply to offer these friends a\r\nhand-grasp.\r\n\r\nThen each person laid down his offering of flowers till her lap was\r\npiled high and her feet were buried deep in a pink-and-white mound,\r\neach as he passed claiming the promised hand-shake. While this was\r\ngoing on, the band played an inspiring air and the people of the\r\nhillside retired with the pleasant consciousness of having enjoyed a\r\nhappy half-hour.\r\n\r\nAfterward Miss Barton had a personal introduction to each member of the\r\nband, who had so kindly assisted in paying honor to one enjoying the\r\nreverence and affection of the American people, as of all classes, from\r\nthe lowest peasantry to the crowned heads in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE FORERUNNERS OF THE RED CROSS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Clara Barton began her ministry in the Civil War, she had\r\npractically no knowledge concerning work that had been done in America\r\nor elsewhere for the relief of wounded soldiers. She did not remember\r\neven to have heard of Florence Nightingale until she was actually\r\nengaged in work of a similar character. When, at Port Royal, she was\r\nserenaded and hailed as “the Florence Nightingale of America,” she\r\nknew what it meant, but she had not known very long. She took up the\r\nduty just as Dorothea Dix and other brave women did, in an earnest\r\neffort to do the thing that needed to be done, and she learned how to\r\ndo it by doing it. She discovered the defects in other systems then\r\nemployed, but did not criticize them. She realized the difficulties\r\nunder which volunteer workers were working, and she carefully refrained\r\nfrom passing any unkind judgments upon organizations that were laboring\r\nunder almost insuperable difficulties. But she found her own method of\r\nwork, and she performed it with a success which, without robbing any\r\nother brave woman of any portion of her due fame, wrought for Clara\r\nBarton a crown of unfading laurel.\r\n\r\nNot until she found herself in Switzerland, and was asked by Swiss\r\nrepresentatives of the Red Cross why America had refused to join in\r\nthat movement, had she found occasion to study the history of movements\r\nfor the relief of wounded on the battle-field.\r\n\r\nThe sick and wounded in the wars of the Crusades were cared for,\r\ninadequately but nobly, by the Knights Hospitallers of St. John of\r\nJerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta. These Christian knights ministered\r\nalike to Christian and Saracen. In some of the subsequent wars of\r\nEurope the Sisters of Charity of the Roman Catholic Church rendered\r\nsuch service as they were able.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the history of the care of the wounded in all the wars, from\r\nthe dawn of history, is one of cruel and, in many respects, of needless\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nDuring the Crimean War Florence Nightingale with thirty-eight nurses\r\nwent from England to Scutari, across the Bosphorus from Constantinople,\r\nand rendered service which made her name a household word the world\r\naround. It was Clara Barton’s lifelong regret that she did not meet\r\nFlorence Nightingale during her long stay in England, but she was sick\r\nand so was Miss Nightingale, and neither thought of the other as being\r\nwithin call.\r\n\r\nThe real beginning of the movement which resulted in the organization\r\nof the Red Cross began with Henri Dunant, who was born at Geneva in\r\n1828. When he was thirty-one years of age, in 1859, the forces of\r\nSardinia and of Victor Emmanuel, with the allied army of France under\r\nNapoleon III, waged war against Austria for the freedom of northern\r\nItaly. At the battle of Solferino, forty thousand soldiers were killed\r\nor wounded. The defeated Austrians retreated, and the French and\r\nItalians pursued, leaving the wounded almost deserted. Surgeons at that\r\ntime were not protected from attack, and the surgeons of each army\r\nmoved on with the army. Dunant gathered women of the neighborhood and\r\ngave what relief he could without distinction of nationality.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Geneva, filled with tragic memories of the scenes of\r\nhorror he had witnessed, he issued a pamphlet entitled “Souvenir de\r\nSolferino.” In this he described the scenes which he had witnessed,\r\nand propounded this question: “Would it not be possible to found and\r\norganize in all civilized countries volunteers which in time of war\r\nwould render succor to the wounded without distinction of nationality?”\r\n\r\nGeneva had an organization for philanthropic and humane work, known as\r\nthe “Society of Public Utility.” Its president was Monsieur Gustave\r\nMoynier. He was deeply moved by Dunant’s pamphlet, and sent out an\r\ninvitation for a conference to organize “An International Conference\r\nfor Investigating Means to Supplement the Inadequacy of Medical\r\nServices of Armies in Campaigns.”\r\n\r\nThis led to the conference of August, 1864, to which reference has\r\nalready been made, in which the United States was unofficially\r\nrepresented by Mr. George C. Fogg, American Minister to Switzerland,\r\nand Mr. Charles S. P. Bowles, European Agent of the Sanitary Commission.\r\n\r\nAll this Clara Barton learned as she studied the history which lay\r\nbehind a movement in which she was to have so important a share. Of\r\nmovements in the United States she already knew.\r\n\r\nThe United States Sanitary Commission was organized in New York City on\r\nMay 18, 1861, with the Reverend Henry W. Bellows, D.D., as president.\r\nThe good which it did in the Civil War was incalculable. In cooperation\r\nwith it was the Western Sanitary Commission, organized in St. Louis on\r\nSeptember 5, 1861.\r\n\r\nThe Young Men’s Christian Associations of the country led in the\r\norganization of the United States Christian Commission, which was\r\nformed in New York, November 16, 1861. Besides these were innumerable\r\nsocieties which were formed by women for the furnishing of supplies,\r\nthe establishment of rest homes, and the distribution of comforts to\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1864, the United States was asked to participate in the work\r\nof the Red Cross, there was very little inclination on the part of\r\nGovernment officials, to treat this request with any more courtesy\r\nthan official etiquette required. The Government did not feel very\r\nkindly toward European Governments for their attitude during the war of\r\nour rebellion. We had established our own agencies for the relief of\r\nsuffering, and had no inclination to add another.\r\n\r\nWhen the war was over, however, Dr. Bellows was confident America would\r\njoin in the International Red Cross. He issued a long letter addressed\r\nto Monsieur Henri Dunant, who was acting as “Secrétaire du Comité\r\nInternational de Secours aux Militairet Blessés.” This Dr. Bellows did\r\nas President of “The American Association for the Relief of Misery of\r\nBattle-fields.” On its title-page was emblazoned a Red Cross as the\r\ninsignia of the organization, the first time that symbol was used in\r\nAmerica, and, until Clara Barton’s day, the last.\r\n\r\nIn this long and earnest and discriminating letter, intended to arouse\r\npublic sentiment in America, Dr. Bellows told, with great plainness of\r\nspeech, of the inadequacy of even those splendid organizations with\r\nwhich he himself had been associated. He said:\r\n\r\n Good intentions and humane sentiments are not alone qualifications for\r\n this duty.... Volunteer agents are the dearest that can be used.... It\r\n is useless to expect correct information on the wants of the soldier\r\n from the Government, or the Medical Bureau, or even the General\r\n Officers. The last thing to which a Government attends in an active\r\n war is the sick and wounded. The Medical is the least interesting\r\n bureau to it, and as a rule army surgeons have hard and coarse views\r\n of humanity to soldiers. General officers seldom see with their own\r\n eyes the details of want and suffering.\r\n\r\nHe paid a high tribute to the work of the women in the war. He said\r\nthat virtually the whole womanhood of the Nation was engaged in it. He\r\nspoke of the women in hospitals, and said that some of them had done\r\nwell, but that “detailed men are the appropriate nurses in military\r\nhospitals. Women are rarely in place at the front, or even at the base\r\nof armies.” He said that, of the women who went to the front, “most\r\nof them were in the way, with a few rare exceptions, where tact and\r\nhumanity were united with force and endurance.” His letters to Clara\r\nBarton leave no doubt as to one whom he considered in the forefront of\r\nthese exceptions, combining, as she did, tact and humanity with force\r\nand endurance.\r\n\r\nDr. Bellows’s effort fell completely flat so far as the organization of\r\nthe society was concerned. He became thoroughly discouraged and gave it\r\nup, and years afterward rejoiced when he saw Clara Barton accomplish\r\nwhat he had vainly striven to do.\r\n\r\nThis was the situation as Clara Barton learned it, when returning\r\nhealth brought back to her the strong purpose of proceeding at once to\r\nthe organization of an American Red Cross.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE YEARS OF LONELY STRUGGLE\r\n\r\n\r\nFor several years after the Franco-Prussian War, Europe was at peace.\r\nBut trouble was brewing between Russia and Turkey, and no one knew\r\nwhat the end of it would be. The probability that there would be war\r\nin Europe appeared to Clara Barton to indicate a possibly favorable\r\ncondition of public sentiment in America for the consideration of the\r\nRed Cross. If there was to be war in Europe, and we were to be asked\r\nto help in the relief of the suffering it would cause, it would seem\r\nfitting that there should be some international organization by which\r\nrelief could be gathered on this side and distributed upon the other.\r\nThe American public would then see some reason why America should be\r\ninterested in an organization of this character.\r\n\r\nClara Barton communicated with Dr. Louis Appia, who had called upon\r\nher in Switzerland, and with whom she had been associated in the\r\nFranco-Prussian War, offering to assist, in such way as she might be\r\nable, in effecting a suitable organization.\r\n\r\nFrom Dr. Appia and from President Gustave Moynier, she received prompt\r\nletters, and, with these, official appointment to represent in America\r\nthe International Committee of the Red Cross. This correspondence is\r\nlengthy, but of the greatest possible value and must be included in\r\nfull:\r\n\r\n  DANSVILLE, May 17, 1877\r\n\r\n  DR. LOUIS APPIA\r\n\r\n  Member Société Internationale of the Red Cross\r\n  of Geneva\r\n\r\n  MY ESTEEMED AND DEAR FRIEND:\r\n\r\n If years have passed since any word from my pen told you of my\r\n existence, and if the precious letter from you has lain many months\r\n unanswered, it has not been the fault of my memory, nor the loss of\r\n friendship, nor interest in you nor in the glorious and holy work\r\n which engrosses and fills your noble life. It has been simply that,\r\n ill, weak, worn, and suffering, I have been lost to the work of the\r\n world, and to the friends I honored and loved. Four long years have\r\n found and held me powerless to strike a blow on the great anvil of\r\n humanity, or labor one day in its vineyards, and for the most part\r\n too weak even to hear of those who did. But the strong brothers and\r\n sisters have toiled bravely on while I waited. The great wheels have\r\n slowly turned, until they have ceased to crush me so low, and grind\r\n me so small, and once more I begin, under God’s Providence, to reach\r\n out my hands into the passing atmosphere of life and feel the breezes\r\n blow over the seared and fevered palms. Once more I dare turn my eyes\r\n toward the labor-fields and their faithful workers; in my land, bright\r\n with its western sunbeams, aglow with beauty and abounding in plenty,\r\n they sew and glean in peaceful valleys.\r\n\r\n But beyond the eastern waves, in that dear old land that four years\r\n of life there taught me to love so well, I see again the flash of\r\n the bayonet, the march of armies trampling down the harvests; the\r\n terror-stricken fly for rescue, and the wounded cry for help. Again\r\n the Red Cross, like the bow of promise, rises over the scene, again\r\n the shout from its inspired origination rings out amid the din of\r\n arms, and its clear, brave tones reach me even here in my quiet\r\n chambers, and my heart, with all its old memories stirred to their\r\n depths, goes out in response; it bids me seize my pen and say to you\r\n that what there is of me is still ready for my work; that like the\r\n old war horse that has rested long in quiet pastures, I recognize the\r\n bugle-note that calls me to my place, and, though I may not do what I\r\n once could, I am come to offer what I may. Then, would I have taken\r\n the next steamer, and in two weeks have stood beside you, asking where\r\n to go, and what to do, but as that is not for me now, my brain and\r\n heart must do what my hands cannot. My plans are made, and, such as\r\n they are, I send them to you for acceptance and coöperation.\r\n\r\n First, I cannot quite rid myself of the lingering hope that the\r\n terrible vision of war before you will vanish before its full\r\n realization, but if not and the nations are drawn into its vortex,\r\n God only knows the end. I cannot foresee it, but I can foresee that\r\n my country will open its heart and its hand in aid as soon as the\r\n cry of want and suffering shall reach it; this never fails. The\r\n American nature is free and impulsive, its sympathies are quick and\r\n responsive, and it has neither power nor desire to withhold aught\r\n from the distressed. But, ready as America will be, she is far away\r\n from the scene, can understand but vaguely the steps necessary to\r\n the proper gathering, sending, and bestowal of her gifts. So without\r\n some definite and well-arranged organization, however large and\r\n generous her donations, she will fail of accomplishing any real or\r\n perceptible good, as she has always failed before in all similar\r\n efforts, at foreign aids. Foreseeing this, I would, if possible, step\r\n in to fill this place, and hold back this waste of waters till they\r\n can be turned into their proper channels. And for this, my honored\r\n friend and brother, I write to you, to ask if I can be of service in\r\n this direction. If so, I will do my best to form such an organization\r\n in America, if you and your Committee desire it. As it is now, in\r\n spite of all efforts which you have so generously made to spread the\r\n knowledge of your society and its great objects in this country, it\r\n is almost unknown, and the Red Cross, in America, is a Mystery. I am\r\n safe in asserting that not one person in a hundred on this side of\r\n the Atlantic ever heard of it; not one in five hundred has any clear\r\n idea of its uses or design. The Franco-German War failed entirely\r\n in introducing it either to the people or the Government, and so\r\n will this present war, unless some active hand takes hold of it,\r\n to organize the war reliefs under its escutcheon. It is not enough\r\n that some good person stands inactively as the _representative_ of\r\n the society in this broad country. To be learned it must be brought\r\n into active use. It must have a National Headquarters, sanctioned\r\n by the Government, where the flag of the beautiful Red Cross floats\r\n day and night, in war and in peace. It must have its different State\r\n organizations, and its smaller relief societies all working under its\r\n insignia. This accomplished, the charities gathered from the people\r\n should be passed to the State and thence to the National Headquarters,\r\n and, these being always in communication with you, they would be\r\n shipped intelligently and reach at once a field in need of them.\r\n My heart aches when I think of all the thousands upon thousands of\r\n dollars in goods and grains sent to France in the best of faith by our\r\n people in 1871 and wasted; lost, squandered, and sold on its borders,\r\n it being impossible to gain transportation or penetrate the army\r\n lines; and all for the want of the proper knowledge and organization\r\n at home. It will be the same thing again unless some method is taken\r\n to centralize, organize, and prevent.\r\n\r\n I have only a word more to add, and I feel called to make the\r\n suggestion I make by the fact that I am perhaps almost the only\r\n American who you can feel has been a co-worker with you, whose manner\r\n of work you _know_ something of, and whom you can class as a personal\r\n friend and thus address familiarly. And my suggestion is, that if you\r\n feel that I can serve your cause, and humanity through it, in the\r\n manner I have described, you will let me know your desires _at once_.\r\n If you will write me immediately upon receipt of this, asking in your\r\n own name or that of the International Society, that I do all in my\r\n power to aid you in the work, and to use my power with my people and\r\n my Government, so that it can be seen here that such a want is felt,\r\n such a work needed, and that the call is from the highest and original\r\n source of international relief in war, investing it with the highest\r\n importance, I will have your letter placed before our President and\r\n Government and ask their sanction and approval, if not the pecuniary\r\n aid; for that I never ask. And if it is inclined to be so gracious, it\r\n may perhaps appoint a Head to the work, thus, by its notice, investing\r\n it with an importance, and throwing about it a protection, which\r\n it could in no other wise secure. This would forever establish the\r\n knowledge and the work of the Red Cross for which its noble founders\r\n have striven so bravely and faithfully in every mile of American soil.\r\n The soldier would learn to trust it, the father would honor and bless\r\n it, the mother would bind it over her torn and aching heart as she\r\n kissed her soldier boy good-bye, and the little children even in the\r\n wilds would come to know and love its beautiful face.\r\n\r\n Now, my honored friend, this is not an appeal that you make _me_ the\r\n head of your noble order in this country, the active working head\r\n I mean, for I have little ambition at best and none now, but it is\r\n to tell you that such a head must be made before the order here can\r\n ever come to be of the smallest possible use to the world. Thus far\r\n it has failed, and I see no way to establish it but by a call coming\r\n earnestly from you and being actively and unselfishly and powerfully\r\n and wisely placed before the moving powers of this Nation and the\r\n people. If you have already some person in your mind who will do this,\r\n or who you prefer should attempt it, then it is all well, only see\r\n that he does his duty and is not asleep at his post. There is no more\r\n time for this. But if you have not such a person in mind, and feel\r\n that I can serve you acceptably, you have but to let me know and I\r\n will do all in my power. Please write me at once. The stronger your\r\n appeal to me, the better use I can make of it, and meanwhile I shall\r\n not be idle or inactive, but will hope to hear from you within the\r\n next six weeks, say by the 1st of July.\r\n\r\n Please accept my most grateful thanks for the kind sympathies\r\n expressed in your letters of last year which I was too ill to answer,\r\n and remember me in great respect to your family and the mutual friends\r\n in my home in Geneva.\r\n\r\n Perhaps to you, as a physician, it would be proper to state that my\r\n long illness has been, as you most likely would suspect, “prostration\r\n of the nervous system,” and you know how slowly one rallies from this,\r\n and with what difficulty the strength is regained. I am now at my\r\n best by far since 1873; am about my house and grounds, ride, walk,\r\n meet friends, and sleep tolerably well, not as in the old days on the\r\n ground without bed or pillow, but comfortably, and am always gaining a\r\n little in strength.\r\n\r\n I trust this may find you well, and it will carry to you the best\r\n wishes and most sincere esteem of\r\n\r\n  Your friend\r\n\r\n  CLARA BARTON\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Translation_]\r\n\r\n  PARIS, June 14, 1877\r\n\r\n  MISS BARTON, AND HONORED FRIEND:\r\n\r\n It is in French that I write to you, for you would laugh at my bad\r\n English. I am at present in Paris on a visit at my brother’s. I hear\r\n that Mr. Moynier has written to you on the same subject which will\r\n make the contents of this letter. I expect Mr. Moynier in Paris in a\r\n few days, which will give me the opportunity to talk the proposition\r\n over with him, which we both wish you to take an interest in.\r\n\r\n Mr. Moynier has undoubtedly told you that our Committee has tried\r\n for these last ten years to give to an American Committee an active\r\n existence, but we failed. In the first years our communications were\r\n made through a Mr. Bowles, then residing at Paris, with whom we ceased\r\n to correspond, not seeing that we arrived to any certain result by\r\n this channel. Later we have been in direct communication with Dr.\r\n Henry W. Bellows, President of a phantom Committee in New York, from\r\n whom we seldom receive an answer. Having therefore no proof that that\r\n committee was active, we ceased to correspond, and we at last learned\r\n officially that that committee was officially and entirely dead. From\r\n that time, about a year since, we considered the Red Cross as not\r\n existing any more in America. I need not speak here of the disease\r\n which has caused that death. You are an American and you know better\r\n than we the temperament of your Nation. Our hope to entertain the life\r\n has been nourished in us by the reading of the admirable work which\r\n America had made for the care of the wounded during the Secession\r\n War. We spoke of it at length in the thick volume which Mr. Moynier\r\n and myself have published under the title, “The War and Charity,” and\r\n which obtained the integral prize of the central committee in Berlin.\r\n Mr. Moynier has told you, without doubt, how happy we should be to\r\n see a work come into life again in your rich and generous America,\r\n which had shone with such a bright luster at the epoch when it was\r\n stimulated by the mighty auxiliary of the patriotic motive. We know\r\n little what America has done for the victims of the Franco-German War,\r\n which you have seen and during which we have for some time worked\r\n together, and I am not surprised that many generous gifts have been\r\n lost for want of a good organization, and especially for want of\r\n being able to establish regular communications with the armies by the\r\n channel of an American auxiliary committee residing in Europe and\r\n which would offer all the security.\r\n\r\n If you, my honored friend, could succeed in organizing something\r\n durable in America, in relation to the Oriental War which appears\r\n only in its beginning, you would have nobly crowned the work of\r\n devotedness to which you have consecrated your life. I do not know\r\n what means of execution Mr. Moynier proposed. I shall write again\r\n upon that subject, when I shall have seen him, so that we agree\r\n completely together in what we tell you. Permit me, however, now to\r\n communicate to you some ideas. You can without doubt become the soul\r\n of this revising work, but you cannot be its _body_. America is not\r\n so different from Europe that my experience cannot profit you for\r\n your country. Now, medicine teaches us that a soul without a body\r\n has no life at all, at least upon earth. Perhaps even it is better\r\n that a woman should be the soul; her moral influence, her earnest\r\n entreaties near the Governments and authorities are often better\r\n accepted and consequently more efficacious. I do not therefore see\r\n any inconvenience that you should be for America the _head of the\r\n Order, the active working head_,--why not? If you feel to have the\r\n brain power as much as I know you have the moral power, but then\r\n create immediately under that head a body, arms to write, to arrange\r\n methodically, to publish, to keep the correspondence, either alone or\r\n under your dictation, for copying, etc., after that, feet for running,\r\n to go, to come, to collect, to buy, to make multitudes of visits and\r\n receive visitors, as we were obliged to do in Geneva in 1870, where\r\n during two months my ten rooms were never empty all day long, each one\r\n containing a secretary, man or woman, to write and to receive a host\r\n of visits which would have killed a President, and of which hardly\r\n a quarter had really any other practical use than to enlighten the\r\n public and to keep up its zeal, not always rational.\r\n\r\n Surround yourself at once with a little body of persons full of\r\n good-will and capacity, docile to your directions, either women or\r\n young men, especially doctors. Amongst the latter choose a secretary\r\n who must be entirely at your service and who probably ought to be paid.\r\n\r\n 1. The first work seems to me to be to awaken the attention, the\r\n sympathy, and the confidence of the public. Without the public, no\r\n money, and without money no material help. You know as well as myself\r\n the means to attain this end is publicity, the power of which is, I\r\n believe, greater in America than in any other country.\r\n\r\n 2. Complete study of the practical and sure means to carry an\r\n efficacious relief to the armies in the Orient. To that effect\r\n one needs to correspond very often with all the relief committees\r\n of Russia, of Rumania, of Serbia, of Montenegro, and even of\r\n Constantinople. It is necessary not to conceal to one’s self that\r\n these intercourses, easy enough on paper, are very difficult in\r\n reality, if one does not want the money or the relief to be lost\r\n to the profit of the war, rather than to the profit of the unhappy\r\n victims.\r\n\r\n In order to obtain this, and our Committee can be of use to you,\r\n and between Mr. Moynier and myself we shall do all we can to help\r\n to enlighten you. But you must also have direct intercourse with\r\n the relief committees of the different countries which are at this\r\n moment engaged in the war, although administratively the international\r\n communications from neutral countries are made by the International\r\n Committee. You know by experience that many letters are in that\r\n case lost in the hands of employees, subordinates, or men too much\r\n occupied, and that one needs to throw the bait often and on several\r\n sides, at the risk of losing much time.\r\n\r\n 3. You must put yourself in direct communication with your President.\r\n I see in it the use, first, to augment your credit in the country;\r\n second, especially to obtain that your letters and your sendings be\r\n given up by persons in high positions and influential, in particular\r\n ambassadors and consuls. You know that question by your experience in\r\n the American war better than I do, and I shall not enlarge upon it.\r\n\r\n 4. You must have money, and you know the means to procure it. The\r\n Sanitary Commission has collected sixty millions of francs during your\r\n war, especially by immense bazaars. In our country bazaars always\r\n succeed, much more so than collections, and produce three to four\r\n times as much. They always succeed, while collections oftentimes fail.\r\n\r\n 5. Once having the necessary money, the question rises, if it would\r\n be advisable to choose two commissaries,--for example, two young\r\n physicians supplied with a recommendation from your President,--who\r\n should go together to Europe with instructions and _plein-pouvoir_\r\n from your new Committee, directed to go first to Geneva to the\r\n International Committee and from there to go directly to the\r\n Headquarters of the Russian army, in order to make its acquaintance\r\n and to obtain from it the authorization to circulate in the army\r\n and to gather all the information necessary for your work. It would\r\n be desirable that they speak tolerable French, this language being\r\n the official one in Europe; if they speak and write only English,\r\n they would lose time and would not always be understood. Those two or\r\n three commissaries should be posted on the theater seat of the war\r\n and should give you all the news by an active correspondence. They\r\n ought probably to engage themselves not to write on politics. I never\r\n did it in war-time of Italy, Schleswig, and France. Besides these\r\n commissaries, you need an office or an agency in Europe to whom all\r\n the relief funds must be addressed and who would take the charge of\r\n sending them on wherever the commissaries indicate. I do not know what\r\n our International Committee will decide upon this, but I think it will\r\n be disposed to be an intermediary between America and the belligerent\r\n armies, as it has done during the War of 1870 by the agency residing\r\n at Bâle placed there by us. This agency has received five hundred\r\n letters, besides other correspondence, every day, either for France or\r\n Germany. Notice, however, that our Committee wish to show an absolute\r\n neutrality and should certainly refuse to coöperate in anything like\r\n a political party. It is, therefore, necessary that your publications\r\n speak out your intention to remain neutral and to carry the relief\r\n indifferently to all those who suffer. That will not hinder you to\r\n correspond more particularly with the Russian army, which for you is\r\n more accessible, with whom the communications are easier, and for\r\n whom I believe America has more political sympathy; but you must\r\n insist on your principle of neutrality in your publications and let\r\n this position be known in Constantinople, and especially to the\r\n Committee newly formed in that city. Your commissaries, after their\r\n arrival at Geneva, might remain there some days in order to study a\r\n little our library which contains everything that has appeared since\r\n the beginning of our work. It would be desirable, however, that the\r\n Committee of the Red Cross in America should buy the principal works,\r\n and that there should be a commission of several established persons\r\n who would take it upon themselves to study them and to give an account\r\n of them; there is a little in every language.\r\n\r\n I have sent you a number of our International Bulletins which appear\r\n every three months, and in which I have spoken of you. The annual\r\n subscription being only six francs, your Committee would take two\r\n subscriptions and by it would know all that is done in the different\r\n countries. Last year we sent three delegates to Montenegro, an\r\n interesting little country, where with material help and money we can\r\n do a great deal of good, and where one is received like a Divinity by\r\n this enthusiastic population, but which is also jealous and suspicious.\r\n\r\n Our old delegates being at Geneva, yours could receive numerous and\r\n useful information. Before realizing this ambassador, we had three\r\n months’ study and treating.\r\n\r\n I send you my discourse made in Brussels, which for your case does\r\n not contain any immediate application. I might give one to your\r\n hypothetical delegates as they pass through Geneva.\r\n\r\n As you see, Miss Barton, and honored friend, I began with the idea\r\n that the American Society of the Red Cross should revise and assure\r\n its stable existence by an immediate employment of its power through a\r\n practical application; relief funds to send to the belligerent armies\r\n of the Oriental War. Once consecrated by action by the remembrance of\r\n what it has done, its basis will be firmer, its credit more assured,\r\n and then you will be able to give it a definite form and shape which\r\n experience will have shown you to be the most useful.\r\n\r\n Not knowing yet what Mr. Moynier has done during my absence, I shall\r\n not send you the letter which I wish to address to your President, but\r\n shall do it as soon as I shall have seen him, if he has not already\r\n done it.\r\n\r\n Write to me at any time concerning the affairs of the Red Cross and\r\n I shall reply as well as I can, being always in accordance with Mr.\r\n Moynier’s wishes, who does not know English.\r\n\r\n You would do well to have Mr. Moynier’s pamphlet translated into\r\n English, “What the Red Cross is.” My little volume, entitled “The\r\n Surgeon at the Ambulance,” has been translated into English either in\r\n England or in America; perhaps it would be well to have a new edition\r\n of it for the circumstance. At last our volume “The War and Charity”\r\n has also been translated into English. For all our publications of the\r\n International Committee and its members it suffices to address Mr.\r\n George, Librarian at Geneva. Perhaps it would be necessary and useful,\r\n after you have plenty of money and fellow-laborers, to publish every\r\n three months a small bulletin of your work in one of the good American\r\n journals.\r\n\r\n And now, my dear Miss Barton, I have talked enough to you about the\r\n Red Cross. I have given you my ideas provisionally, expecting better\r\n ones later. You see, I have spoken to you familiarly and with an\r\n entire confidence and fraternal friendship which our intercourse and\r\n our common work in Europe has brought forth.\r\n\r\n May God sustain you, if you do undertake this new work, and, in\r\n entertaining and augmenting your corporal strength and brain power,\r\n may He continue to inspire you with that moral irresistible power,\r\n that invincible strength, which He alone can give and which the\r\n incredulous humanitarian never can give.\r\n\r\n Accept, Miss Barton, and honored friend, the assurance of my\r\n respectful friendship.\r\n\r\n  LOUIS APPIA, DR.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DANSVILLE, July 1st, 1877\r\n\r\n  DOCTEUR LOUIS APPIA\r\n\r\n  Membre Comité International de Secours aux\r\n  Militaires blessés, Geneva\r\n\r\n  DOCTEUR AND HONORED FRIEND:\r\n\r\n I cannot find the words to properly express to you my gratitude for\r\n the kind and careful manner in which you have treated my letter. But\r\n first allow me to thank Madame Appia for her generous part, and all\r\n the prompt care she took to place it in the proper hands, and let\r\n me thank both for the excellent photograph, so welcome now, and for\r\n all the future to be preserved among my choicest and most honored\r\n keepsakes.\r\n\r\n How kind it was of you, my good friend, to give me so much of your\r\n time and labor, embodied in that long letter so filled with valuable\r\n suggestions! If nothing more comes of it, it will at least bring us\r\n to an understanding in reference to the actual existence and standing\r\n of the Order of the Red Cross in America. I was extremely guarded\r\n in my letter, not at all knowing how you stood in regard to your\r\n selected representative in this country, for I knew you had one, and,\r\n if you were satisfied, I did not wish to ripple the calm waters of\r\n confidence and security by even one pebble of discontent or doubt.\r\n I wrote cautiously like a woman. _You_ have spoken out like a man,\r\n and it is well. With the pains your Comité have taken, the Red Cross\r\n should have been known and honored in every household in America\r\n to-day. It has not _died_ here: it was still-born; it has never once\r\n gasped on our shores; the nurses to whom you delivered it have never\r\n even uncovered its face, and America does not know that this holy\r\n child was ever an applicant for her adoption. She would have received\r\n it with open arms at the close of our war, when her own wounds\r\n were unhealed, and her memories fresh and tender. She will be less\r\n enthusiastic now at the end of a ten years’ peace, and no prospect of\r\n war. Still, the understanding and heart of the American people will\r\n lead them to examine and promote whatever cause has for its object\r\n the benefit of mankind, or the alleviation of human woe. I think I\r\n know my people, and although, through want of proper opportunities,\r\n or physical strength, or mental capacity, I may not be able to move\r\n them in this matter, this fact will in no way affect their general\r\n character, and, when all things combine for the proper presentation of\r\n this subject to them by whomsoever it may be, it _will_ be received\r\n and adopted by them. Your suggestions are excellent and lay out much\r\n such a field of labor as I had looked forward to, and all this would\r\n be easy of accomplishment in America, if an urgent necessity existed.\r\n Until it does, it would be, I suspect, a difficult task to work up\r\n sufficient enthusiasm, but it was in anticipation of such a necessity\r\n that I was endeavoring to prepare the way. The simple war between\r\n Russia and Turkey might not be able to awaken the people, for we\r\n have a comparatively small element of either nationality among our\r\n populations, but if other European nations engage and Germany, France,\r\n and England, or all become involved, the interest in America will be\r\n scarcely less than on the other side. Then would be a repetition of\r\n the old sad days of the Franco-Prussian War, when every heart was sad\r\n and every purse open, they tell me, and half America in mourning.\r\n\r\n Now, my idea was, in anticipation of such a state of affairs in Europe\r\n as should call for the sympathies and aid of the Americans, to be\r\n prepared with an organization, which would be only the body of clay,\r\n like the first man Adam, until the breath of life was breathed into\r\n its nostrils. This breath would be the necessity and the call for help\r\n from the suffering fields and peoples of Europe; then it would be well\r\n that the body were created to receive it. The first step, it seems\r\n to me, is to find and appoint to the head of the work some person in\r\n America who will have the spirit, the interest, the enterprise, the\r\n determination to _push_ the work, and bring it before the country and\r\n the people, or the honest conscience to resign the position in favor\r\n of some one who will, and not hold it for years, as an empty honor,\r\n smothering out its life, and leaving the country in ignorance of its\r\n existence.\r\n\r\n I am very grateful to you for the kindly interest you take in the\r\n subject of my health. My sleep, which I know to be the great want,\r\n is always gaining, and digestion improving, and these without the\r\n slightest artificial aid. I never took a grain of morphia in my life,\r\n and probably never in all combined a tablespoonful of medicine to\r\n produce sleep, and now I take nothing; for the last three years not\r\n one particle of medicine, relying entirely upon my food, rest, and\r\n open air for my restoration. All I have gained has been by the aid of\r\n nature alone; thus I know the foundation is solid and sure. I allow\r\n nothing to trouble me, as indeed I have no cause for trouble. I walk,\r\n or work in my garden, or lie on my stretcher like a soldier under the\r\n trees several hours every day; and here come around me the memories of\r\n the past, the busy present, and the needful future. I wonder what you\r\n are all doing over this broad world, and how I can help you. If I find\r\n myself able to carry on a work I shall do it; if not, I shall endeavor\r\n to inspire those who are.\r\n\r\n  Your friend\r\n  CLARA BARTON\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Translation_]\r\n\r\n  TO MISS CLARA BARTON\r\n  Dansville, Livingston Co., N.Y.\r\n\r\n  MISS BARTON, AND WORTHY FRIEND:\r\n\r\n According to my promise I write to you after having seen Mr. Moynier,\r\n although I have nothing very new to tell you, and have only to confirm\r\n what I have written to you in detail. I can therefore be brief this\r\n second time. Mr. Moynier and myself are equally sympathetic to your\r\n plan, and we shall be happy if you succeed in founding in America a\r\n permanent work of the Red Cross. And we shall help you in it with our\r\n influence to the extent of our power.\r\n\r\n Mr. Moynier has written me that he has already told you so. He\r\n has added to his communication a suggestion which indeed is very\r\n important, i.e., that you obtain from the Government of the United\r\n States the signing of the Convention of Geneva, which has already\r\n been done by all other civilized states in Europe and out of Europe.\r\n Without this signature, the private work of the Red Cross is\r\n paralyzed. Here is an example of what has very recently taken place\r\n in Montenegro, of which we have asked the signature before putting\r\n ourselves in relation with it, and before sending to it our three\r\n delegates with help for their wounded. All succeeded very well, and\r\n Montenegro has entered eagerly into the general alliance of the\r\n Convention of Geneva. It will be the same with America, we will hope,\r\n which has remained back until now. But in order to ensure its success,\r\n it will probably be necessary to make a summary communication to the\r\n Government what the Convention of Geneva is, its destiny, and what the\r\n Red Cross is. You will find all the desirable details upon this point\r\n in the pamphlets or works which Monsieur Moynier mentions or sends to\r\n you. It will be necessary that some person take cognizance of this\r\n work with you, and assist you in it. The Red Cross has existed since\r\n 1863. Since then it has given birth to an entire new literature, so as\r\n to make by itself a real library.\r\n\r\n And now, my worthy friend, go on courageously with faith and hope.\r\n The cause is good: let us defend it everywhere and let us be firm in\r\n upholding the banner of charity. It will be ever the surest means of\r\n combating the principle of war.\r\n\r\n Write to me when you have done something, with or without translation.\r\n My previous letter will give you all the details of my manner of\r\n viewing it.\r\n\r\n As to our participation in your sending of _secours_, I think with\r\n Mr. Moynier that it would be better that we offer our coöperation\r\n directly, when we succeed this time in founding an International\r\n Agency. As formerly in 1870 we have founded one in Basle, which\r\n has been very active and useful, and consequently if you have any\r\n substance or provisions to send, it would be better that you send\r\n directly.\r\n\r\n Besides we shall always be at your service to help and advise you, and\r\n we shall be very glad to be kept informed what you are doing, and we\r\n shall publish your work in our trimonthly Bulletin.\r\n\r\n I could not see again Mr. Moynier, but I know he has nothing important\r\n to add to what I say and to what he has already written to you.\r\n I believe, therefore, you have from us all the indications and\r\n information which we can give you. There remains nothing else for me,\r\n Miss Barton, than to repeat my good wishes for your useful enterprise.\r\n May you feel your physical strength to keep up and increase, as much\r\n as your moral, for the good of others and for your own satisfaction.\r\n\r\n I have nothing more to add, and I will not put off any longer this\r\n last letter.\r\n\r\n Accept, Miss Barton, and worthy friend, the expression of my\r\n respectful devotion,\r\n\r\n  LOUIS APPIA, DR.\r\n\r\n\r\n [Rough draft of letter without date, but evidently written about July\r\n 1st, 1877]\r\n\r\n  MONSIEUR S. MOYNIER\r\n  Président du Comité International de la Croix rouge\r\n\r\n  MY ESTEEMED FRIEND:\r\n\r\n Permit me to thank you, as I do most sincerely, for your kind and\r\n excellent letter of June 20th, and say how happy I am to find you so\r\n fully concurring with the ideas I had advanced in relation to the\r\n action to be taken in the attempted establishment of your beautiful\r\n Order of the Red Cross in America. It is unnecessary for me to assure\r\n you that I will do all that lies in my power to accomplish this\r\n end, believing as I do most implicitly that every step taken toward\r\n softening and humanizing the conditions of war is a _double_ step\r\n toward its extirpation from a place among the codes of nations. This\r\n proves itself by the unfailing fact that the more barbarous a nation\r\n and the more inhuman its modes of warfare, the more frequent and\r\n unmitigated its wars. This conviction, added to the strong desire\r\n which has grown within me to lessen the sufferings of those who must\r\n compose armies while they do exist among the nations of the earth,\r\n will prove a sufficient stimulus to all the powers of my nature, and I\r\n will bring to the object the fullest strength I possess, and then, if\r\n with your best aid I fail in my purpose, I must be content to submit\r\n to the inevitable.\r\n\r\n My intelligent friend and your compatriot, Mademoiselle Küpfer, has\r\n begged to add a letter to you, which I am most thankful for, as\r\n she can speak to you in your own tongue, and with a clearness of\r\n expression which I could not. I shall be very busy for the few coming\r\n hot weeks of August translating the many valuable pamphlets so kindly\r\n sent me, from which I hope to gather a knowledge of the action of\r\n the Society and familiarity with its spirit, which may enable me to\r\n convince my Government of the right and propriety of what we ask it to\r\n do, the wrong and absurdity of withholding it, and secure from it at\r\n least an _official reply_ to your invitation to join the Convention.\r\n\r\n I will not make this communication longer, excepting to repeat my\r\n thanks for your kind letter, and the generous spirit in which it was\r\n written, and assure you of the great pleasure it will afford me to\r\n be of never so small a service in a cause so noble and holy. With\r\n assurances of the highest esteem I remain,\r\n\r\n  Most honored Sir\r\n  Very truly\r\n  CLARA BARTON\r\n\r\n\r\n  DANSVILLE, LIVINGSTON CO., N.Y.\r\n  Sept. 27, 1877\r\n\r\n  MONSIEUR MOYNIER\r\n  President\r\n\r\n  ESTEEMED SIR:\r\n\r\n Your communication of the 19th August, enclosing a letter addressed\r\n to the President of the United States, arrived in due time, and my\r\n impulse was to write at once assuring you how kind and satisfactory I\r\n found them both to be. But at that moment I hoped it would be possible\r\n to see the President and present your letter very soon, and thought\r\n it better to defer my reply to you until this were accomplished, and\r\n I had some results to communicate. But you will perhaps have observed\r\n that the President and several members of his Cabinet are making\r\n very extensive travels over the country this summer, and since the\r\n arrival of your letter he has never been in Washington or acting in\r\n his official capacity in any place, long enough for me to reach him.\r\n We had expected an extra session of Congress to be convened on the 3rd\r\n of October, which would have ensured his presence in Washington, but\r\n even _this_ being now uncertain, I feel that I must not longer delay\r\n my letter to you, with the assurance that it shall be my pleasure to\r\n present your letter to the President at the earliest moment in which I\r\n can reach him, and whenever this is done, I shall at once transmit to\r\n you the results as well as the nature of the interview.\r\n\r\n With kind regards to Dr. Appia and sentiments of the highest esteem\r\n for yourself,\r\n\r\n  I am\r\n\r\n  Very truly\r\n\r\n  CLARA BARTON\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, D.C., UNITED STATES\r\n  January 14, 1878\r\n\r\n  DOCTOR LOUIS APPIA\r\n  Geneva, Switzerland.\r\n\r\n  MY ESTEEMED FRIEND:\r\n\r\n I feel that it is time I should tell you gentlemen of Geneva what I am\r\n doing or trying to do in America with our favorite subject of the Red\r\n Cross, but, as my present letter, from the incompleteness of my work,\r\n cannot take the form of a report, I will address it, not to Monsieur\r\n Moynier, as the President of the Convention, but familiarly to you, as\r\n my friend and co-worker.\r\n\r\n I remember to have written in the autumn that I could not get an\r\n opportunity to present the letter of Monsieur Moynier to our President\r\n until his summer journeyings were ended. But when he returned to\r\n Washington in October, I came here also, a distance of some four\r\n hundred miles, and commenced slowly and carefully my work.\r\n\r\n I found the great difficulty to consist, not in the opposition I\r\n should meet at first, but in the facts that no one understood the\r\n subject, and there was no printed literature pertaining to it in the\r\n language _familiar_ to the people to whom I desired to present it\r\n (with the exception of our State Department, which is, of course,\r\n conversant with all languages).\r\n\r\n Thus my only method was to translate, write and rewrite, and explain\r\n until an understanding and interest were created. I did not think it\r\n wise to present the letter of Monsieur Moynier to President Hayes\r\n until the subject was somewhat understood by the parties to whom he\r\n would be compelled to refer it, viz., the State and War Departments,\r\n leading members of the Bar, as counsellors, and some of the prominent\r\n members of Congress. I accordingly commenced with these parties\r\n myself, explaining the subject, and doing my best to create an\r\n interest and secure coöperation whenever the matter should come up\r\n for discussion or decision. From Congress I proceeded to the heads of\r\n departments and their assistants, and, gaining an audience, explained\r\n the cause to them one by one. The interviews were frequently very\r\n long, and I have, with most of them, not only left a full translation\r\n of the Resolutions, but read them with them, hearing their queries,\r\n and explaining the practical working of the system as I had seen and\r\n known it.\r\n\r\n When I thought I had sufficiently guarded the outposts, I ventured to\r\n ask audience of the President (this was only last week) and presented\r\n to him the letter of Monsieur Moynier and a copy of the Resolutions.\r\n\r\n President Hayes received the letter with great respect and will refer\r\n it to the Secretary of State for decision.\r\n\r\n I had previously found, by examination at the State Department, that\r\n the subject had once come before our Government at the time of the\r\n Convention in Paris, and been declined by President Grant, and his\r\n Secretary of State, Mr. Fish, on the ground of danger from _entangling\r\n alliances_, which it was a fundamental principle of our Government\r\n to avoid. This record stands in my way, and the greatest difficulty\r\n I shall have to meet and overcome will be this previous decision.\r\n If it had never been presented at all, and I had thus no former\r\n decision to reverse, I should hope for a comparatively easy task, but\r\n _formalities_ and _courtesies_ stand greatly in the way of reversing\r\n or setting aside the decisions of a previous authority, and especially\r\n such authority as General Grant and his popular Secretary, Mr. Fish.\r\n This adverse decision I hold to have been the result of a hasty and\r\n improper presentation of the subject without suitable explanation,\r\n and, from the lack of a full understanding of the system, it was\r\n considered wisdom on the part of our Government to let it alone.\r\n\r\n Now, I do not despair of success in the end, for I have met only\r\n the greatest courtesy and most patient attention on the part of all\r\n officials, and I promised the President that I would wait within call,\r\n in order to be ready to make any explanations and answer any questions\r\n which he or the members of his Cabinet might desire to ask. I have\r\n no definite idea of the length of time they may hold the matter under\r\n consideration before deciding, but it is so far progressed that my\r\n own attorney can probably assist me, and he will arrive here in a\r\n day or two. This is the Honorable Judge Hale, of the State of New\r\n York, one of the best counsellors in the country, and is not only my\r\n personal attorney of many years, but also a near relative. I did not\r\n call him until I had thoroughly prepared the ground, but now that\r\n the heads of the Government understand the subject properly through\r\n my explanations, I must wait and let them make their points of law\r\n upon it and decide. One thing I am certain of, that it would have\r\n been of very little use for any one to have presented the request in\r\n an ordinary manner, or who had not time to spend upon it, or was not\r\n willing to work for the cause. With that previous refusal in the way,\r\n it will require great care, labor, and perseverance to gain the point\r\n desired, but I shall not despair until I must. I regret that I have\r\n not in all this time a more certain progress to report, but I thought\r\n it proper to let you know what stage of the work I am in, and that\r\n all that is possible is being done. It is almost three months since\r\n I left home and came here to work for this cause. My health has not\r\n suffered, but has held firm beyond any expectation of mine. I must\r\n think this is largely due to the great kindness and friendly courtesy\r\n which has been extended to me on every hand. Every official person\r\n listens patiently to all I have to say, and asks with the greatest\r\n kindness what I would like him to do to further my wishes or aid my\r\n cause, and I know that, if in the end the Government refuses to sign,\r\n it will be only upon a strict point of law, which it feels bound not\r\n to overstep (after mature deliberation), and it will be grieved to\r\n feel compelled to disappoint either the members of the Convention or\r\n myself. The Government of so vast a country as the United States is a\r\n great body to move, and, in order to accomplish anything under it, it\r\n is necessary that one have some knowledge of it, some weight with it,\r\n and an endless patience and perseverance.\r\n\r\n I hope it will not be another three months before I can send some more\r\n decisive information, which I shall not fail to do at the earliest\r\n moment.\r\n\r\n My address while in this city will be in the care of that most worthy\r\n and estimable representative of your Republic, the Honorable John\r\n Hitz, Consul-General of Switzerland, whose guest I am.\r\n\r\n Begging pardon for so long a letter which tells so little, and hoping\r\n that this finds both you and Mrs. Appia in excellent health, and with\r\n most respectful regards to Monsieur Moynier, I remain, my esteemed\r\n friend,\r\n\r\n With assurances of the highest esteem\r\n\r\n  Truly yours\r\n\r\n  CLARA BARTON\r\n\r\n\r\nArmed with this authority, Clara Barton now undertook to secure public\r\ninterest in and official recognition for the Red Cross which existed in\r\nEurope, but in America had no existence whatever excepting in her dream\r\nand hope and prayer. There still are extant a very few copies of the\r\nthin little pamphlet which she issued in 1878 addressed to the people\r\nof the United States and the Senators and Representatives in Congress.\r\nIt will bear quoting entire. It contains the sum total of the knowledge\r\nwhich America had of the Red Cross in 1878:\r\n\r\n  THE RED CROSS OF THE GENEVA CONVENTION\r\n  WHAT IT IS\r\n\r\n  BY CLARA BARTON\r\n\r\n _To the people of the United States, Senators and Representatives in\r\n Congress_:\r\n\r\nHaving had the honor conferred upon me of appointment by the Central\r\nCommission holding the Geneva Convention, to present that treaty to\r\nthis Government, and to take in charge the formation of a national\r\norganization according to the plan pursued by the committees working\r\nunder the treaty, it seems to me but proper, that, while I ask the\r\nGovernment to sign it, the people and their representatives should be\r\nmade acquainted with its origin, designs, methods of work, etc. To\r\nthis end I have prepared the following statement, and present it to my\r\ncountrymen and women, hoping they will be led to endorse and sustain a\r\nbenevolence so grand in its character, and already almost universal in\r\nits recognition and adoption by the civilized world.\r\n\r\n  CLARA BARTON\r\n\r\n  _Washington, D.C._\r\n\r\n\r\n WHAT THE RED CROSS IS\r\n\r\n A confederation of relief societies in different countries, acting\r\n under the Geneva Convention, carries on its work under the sign of the\r\n Red Cross. The aim of these societies is to ameliorate the condition\r\n of wounded soldiers in the armies in campaign on land or sea.\r\n\r\n The societies had their rise in the conviction of certain\r\n philanthropic men that the official sanitary service in wars is\r\n usually insufficient, and that the charity of the people, which at\r\n such times exhibits itself munificently, should be organized for the\r\n best possible utilization. An international public conference was\r\n called at Geneva, Switzerland, in 1863, which, though it had not an\r\n official character, brought together representatives from a number\r\n of Governments. At this conference a treaty was drawn up, afterward\r\n remodeled and improved, which twenty-five Governments have signed.\r\n\r\n The treaty provides for the neutrality of all sanitary supplies,\r\n ambulances, surgeons, nurses, attendants, and sick or wounded men, and\r\n their safe-conduct, when they bear the sign of the organization, viz.,\r\n the Red Cross.\r\n\r\n Although the convention which originated the organization was\r\n necessarily international, the relief societies themselves are\r\n entirely national and independent; each one governing itself and\r\n making its own laws according to the genius of its nationality and\r\n needs.\r\n\r\n It was necessary for recognizance and safety, and for carrying out\r\n the general provisions of the treaty, that a uniform badge should\r\n be agreed upon. The Red Cross was chosen out of compliment to the\r\n Swiss Republic, where the first convention was held, and in which\r\n the Central Commission has its headquarters. The Swiss colors being\r\n a white cross on a red ground, the badge chosen was these colors\r\n reversed.\r\n\r\n There are no “members of the Red Cross,” but only members of societies\r\n whose _sign_ it is. There is no “_Order of the Red Cross_.” The relief\r\n societies use, each according to its convenience, whatever methods\r\n seem best suited to prepare in times of peace for the necessities of\r\n sanitary service in times of war. They gather and store gifts of money\r\n and supplies; arrange hospitals, ambulances, methods of transportation\r\n of wounded men, bureaus of information, correspondence, etc. All that\r\n the most ingenious philanthropy could devise and execute has been\r\n attempted in this direction.\r\n\r\n In the Franco-Prussian War this was abundantly tested. That Prussia\r\n acknowledged its beneficence is proven by the fact that the Emperor\r\n affixed the Red Cross to the Iron Cross of Merit.\r\n\r\n Although the societies are not international, there is a tacit compact\r\n between them, arising from their common origin, identity of aim, and\r\n mutual relation to the treaty. This compact embraces four principles,\r\n viz., centralization, preparation, impartiality, and solidarity.\r\n\r\n 1. _Centralization._ The efficiency of relief in time of war depends\r\n on unity of direction; therefore in every country the relief societies\r\n have a common central head to which they send their supplies, and\r\n which communicates for them with the seat of war or with the surgical\r\n military authorities, and it is through this central commission they\r\n have governmental recognition.\r\n\r\n 2. _Preparation._ It is understood that societies working under the\r\n Red Cross shall occupy themselves with preparatory work in times of\r\n peace. This gives them a permanence they could not otherwise have.\r\n\r\n 3. _Impartiality._ The societies of belligerent nations cannot always\r\n carry aid to their wounded countrymen who are captured by the enemy;\r\n this is counterbalanced by the regulation that the aid of the Red\r\n Cross societies shall be extended alike to friend and foe.\r\n\r\n 4. _Solidarity._ This provides that the societies of nations not\r\n engaged in war may afford aid to the sick and wounded of belligerent\r\n nations without affecting any principle of non-interference to which\r\n their Governments may be pledged. This must be done through the\r\n Central Commission, and not through either of the belligerent parties;\r\n this ensures impartiality of relief.\r\n\r\n That these principles are practical has been thoroughly tested during\r\n the fifteen years the Red Cross has existed.\r\n\r\n The Convention of Geneva does not exist as a society, but is simply\r\n a treaty under which all the relief societies of the Red Cross are\r\n enabled to carry on their work effectually. In time of war, the\r\n members and agents of the societies who go to the seat of war are\r\n obliged to have their badges _vizéed_ by the Central Commission, and\r\n by one of the belligerents--this is in order to prevent fraud. Thus\r\n the societies and the treaty complement each other. The societies find\r\n and execute the relief, the treaty affords them the immunities which\r\n _enable_ them to execute.\r\n\r\n And it may be further made a part of the _raison d’être_ of these\r\n national relief societies to afford ready succor and assistance to\r\n sufferers in time of national or widespread calamities, such as\r\n plagues, cholera, yellow fever and the like, devastating fires or\r\n floods, railway disasters, mining catastrophes, etc. The readiness\r\n of organizations like those of the Red Cross to extend help at the\r\n instant of need renders the aid of quadruple value and efficiency\r\n compared with that gathered hastily and irresponsibly, in the\r\n bewilderment and shock which always accompanies such calamities. The\r\n trained nurses and attendants subject to the relief societies in\r\n such cases would accompany the supplies sent and remain in action as\r\n long as needed. Organized in every State, the relief societies of\r\n the Red Cross would be ready with money, nurses, and supplies, to\r\n go on call to the instant relief of all who were overwhelmed by any\r\n of those sudden calamities which occasionally visit us. In case of\r\n yellow fever, there being an organization in every State, the nurses\r\n and attendants would be first chosen from the nearest societies, and,\r\n being acclimated, would incur far less risk to life than if sent\r\n from distant localities. It is true that the Government is always\r\n ready in these times of public need to furnish transportation, and\r\n often does much more. In the Mississippi flood, a few years ago, it\r\n ordered rations distributed under the direction of army officers;\r\n in the case of the explosion at the navy yard, it voted a relief\r\n fund, and in our recent affliction at the South, a like course was\r\n pursued. But in such cases one of the greatest difficulties is that\r\n there is no organized method of administering the relief which the\r\n Government or liberal citizens are willing to bestow, nor trained and\r\n acclimated nurses ready to give intelligent care to the sick; or,\r\n if there be organization, it is hastily formed in the time of need,\r\n and is therefore comparatively inefficient and wasteful. It would\r\n seem to be full time that, in consideration of the growth and rapidly\r\n accumulating necessities of our country, we should learn to economize\r\n our charities, and ensure from them the greatest possible practical\r\n benevolence. Although we in the United States may fondly hope to be\r\n seldom visited by the calamities of war, yet the misfortunes of other\r\n nations with which we are on terms of amity appeal to our sympathies;\r\n our southern coasts are periodically visited by the scourge of yellow\r\n fever; the valleys of the Mississippi are subject to destructive\r\n inundations; the plains of the West are devastated by insects and\r\n drought, and our cities and country are swept by consuming fires.\r\n In all such cases, to gather and dispense the profuse liberality of\r\n our people, without waste of time or material, requires the wisdom\r\n that comes of experience and permanent organization. Still more does\r\n it concern, if not our safety, at least our honor, to signify our\r\n approval of those principles of humanity acknowledged by every other\r\n civilized nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE BIRTH OF THE AMERICAN RED CROSS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is important that this book shall make plain, by means of all\r\nnecessary emphasis, and if need be by reiteration, that the United\r\nStates did not come automatically or promptly into the sisterhood of\r\nnations associated under the banner of the Red Cross. From 1864 until\r\n1881 was a period of seventeen years. The United States was the last\r\nof the great civilized nations of the world to ratify the treaty. It\r\nis also important to make plain that the work of securing this tardy\r\nrecognition of the Red Cross on the part of the United States did not\r\ndevolve upon an organization in this country, or upon a group of people\r\nlaboring together. If ever a great enterprise came into being as the\r\nresult of the persistent, indefatigable effort of one person, that\r\nresult was achieved by Clara Barton in securing the adhesion of her own\r\ncountry to the international agreement which included the Red Cross.\r\n\r\nClara Barton undertook to secure national recognition for this\r\norganization during the administration of President Rutherford B.\r\nHayes. She had already begun work in this direction as early as 1876,\r\nand it seemed that she had every requisite for success when, in 1877,\r\nPresident Moynier addressed an official letter to President Hayes\r\ninforming him of Miss Barton’s appointment, and asking that the United\r\nStates come into the agreement. But the promised success was delayed.\r\n\r\nPresident Hayes received Miss Barton at the White House, and listened\r\ncourteously but not enthusiastically to her story. So did the\r\nAttorney-General of the United States, the Honorable Charles Devens,\r\nto whom the President referred her, and who found no serious legal\r\nobstacle in the way of her desire. Each sent her with a note of\r\nintroduction to the Secretary of State. President Hayes wrote the\r\nfollowing little note:\r\n\r\n  EXECUTIVE MANSION\r\n  WASHINGTON, 4 Jany, 1878\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\n Miss Clara Barton of New York State has some plans regarding the\r\n mitigation of the cruelties of war which she wishes to present to you.\r\n Please give her a hearing and such aid and encouragement as may be\r\n deemed by you fit.\r\n\r\n  Sincerely\r\n  R. B. HAYES\r\n\r\n  HON. W. M. EVARTS\r\n  _etc., etc._\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the movement encountered apathy and quiet but determined\r\nopposition, and resulted in no executive action.\r\n\r\nIn a little scratch-book I find Clara Barton’s own account of this\r\ndisappointment. Her narrative goes back to Civil War days and then\r\nproceeds with her experience overseas, and her service in the\r\nFranco-Prussian War:\r\n\r\n As I journeyed on and saw the work of the Red Cross Society, more\r\n accomplished in four months under their systematic organization than\r\n in our four years without it, no mistakes, no needless suffering, no\r\n starving, no lack of care, no waste, no confusion,--all busy and at\r\n work, a whole continent marshaled under the banner of the Red Cross,\r\n working instead of weeping, nursing instead of waiting,--as I saw all\r\n this and journeyed and worked with it, I said to myself, “If I live to\r\n return to my country I will try to let her people understand the Red\r\n Cross.” I did more than resolve; I promised other nations I would do\r\n it. In 1873 I returned, more broken than I went. There had been years\r\n of helplessness in which I forgot how to walk; still I remembered\r\n my resolution and my promise. I came to Dansville and I brought that\r\n resolution and that promise with me. After about two years I was able\r\n to go to Washington with a letter from the International Committee of\r\n Geneva to the President of the United States asking once more that\r\n America sign the Treaty of Geneva.\r\n\r\n Being made the official bearer of this letter, I presented it in 1877\r\n in person to President Hayes. He received it kindly and referred it\r\n and me to his Secretary of State, Mr. Evarts, who in his turn referred\r\n it to his Assistant Secretary, Mr. Frederick Seward, as the person\r\n who would know all about it, examine it, and report for decision. Mr.\r\n Seward had been the Assistant Secretary of his father and of Secretary\r\n Fish when it had been previously presented. He remembered this refusal\r\n and referred me to the record. He regarded it as a settled thing. I\r\n saw that it was all made to depend on one man, and that man regarded\r\n it as settled. I had nothing to hope for then, but did not press the\r\n matter to a third refusal. It waited and so did I.\r\n\r\nNor had she any better success in her approach to members of Congress.\r\nThey were either apathetic or positively hostile. They knew nothing\r\nabout the Red Cross and they cared less. The United States was not\r\ngoing to have any more wars. If it ever should have any wars, this\r\ncountry would manage them in its own way. It did not care that any\r\none in Europe should tell it how to provide for the care of sick and\r\nwounded men. As for relief to be sent from America to any countries\r\nin Europe that might be in war, the American people were fully\r\ncompetent to create their own agencies on this side of the water, and\r\nto distribute relief through such agencies as they might select or\r\nconstitute upon the other side.\r\n\r\nEven Miss Barton’s staunch friends in the Senate and in the House could\r\ngive her very little aid or comfort. If she could enlist the interest\r\nof the President or of the Secretary of State, something might\r\npossibly be done. Otherwise, it was useless to try.\r\n\r\nSo far as is known, Clara Barton’s little eight-page pamphlet, issued\r\nin 1878, had no more effect than Dr. Bellows’s sixteen-page pamphlet\r\nin 1866. If a single newspaper had taken it up and commented favorably\r\nupon it, Clara Barton would have been practically certain to have\r\nclipped and treasured the article or editorial. There is not in her\r\npapers a single letter or newspaper clipping which indicates that any\r\nman, woman, or child in the United States responded favorably to her\r\npublished letter which was quoted in the last chapter. She used her pen\r\nand her voice and her power of personal persuasion without avail. The\r\nseed of that sowing appeared to fall upon the rocks, and it took no\r\nroot.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1880, James A. Garfield was elected President of the\r\nUnited States. Miss Barton knew him somewhat. She wrote him a letter\r\nof congratulation, to which he returned a brief but gracious reply.\r\nSoon after his inauguration she called on him at the White House and\r\npresented the following letter which nearly four years before she had\r\nbrought to the attention of President Hayes:\r\n\r\n  INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR THE\r\n  RELIEF OF WOUNDED SOLDIERS\r\n  GENEVA, August 19, 1877\r\n\r\n  _To the President of the United States, at Washington_:\r\n\r\n Mr. PRESIDENT: The International Committee of the Red Cross desires\r\n most earnestly that the United States should be associated with them\r\n in their work, and they take the liberty of addressing themselves to\r\n you, with the hope that you will second their efforts. In order that\r\n the functions of the National Society of the Red Cross be faithfully\r\n performed, it is indispensable that it should have the sympathy and\r\n protection of the Government.\r\n\r\n It would be irrational to establish an association upon the principles\r\n of the Convention of Geneva, without the association having the\r\n assurance that the army of its own country, of which it should be\r\n an auxiliary, would be guided, should the case occur, by the same\r\n principles. It would consequently be useless for us to appeal to the\r\n people of the country, inasmuch as the United States, as a Government,\r\n has made no declaration of adhering officially to the principles laid\r\n down by the Convention of the 22d August, 1864.\r\n\r\n Such is, then, Mr. President, the principal object of the present\r\n request. We do not doubt but this will meet with a favorable reception\r\n from you, for the United States is in advance of Europe upon the\r\n subject of war, and the celebrated “Instructions of the American Army”\r\n are a monument which does honor to the United States.\r\n\r\n You are aware, Mr. President, that the Government of the United States\r\n was officially represented at the Conference of Geneva, in 1864, by\r\n two delegates, and this mark of approbation given to the work which\r\n was being accomplished was then considered by every one as a precursor\r\n of a legal ratification. Until the present time, however, this\r\n confirmation has not taken place, and we think that this formality,\r\n which would have no other bearing than to express publicly the\r\n acquiescence of the United States in those humanitarian principles now\r\n admitted by all civilized people, has only been retarded because the\r\n occasion has not offered itself. We flatter ourselves with the hope\r\n that appealing directly to your generous sentiments will determine you\r\n to take the necessary measures to put an end to a situation so much to\r\n be regretted. We only wait such good news, Mr. President, in order to\r\n urge the founding of an American Society of the Red Cross.\r\n\r\n We have already an able and devoted assistant in Miss Clara Barton, to\r\n whom we confide the care of handing to you this present request.\r\n\r\n It would be very desirable that the projected asseveration should be\r\n under your distinguished patronage, and we hope that you will not\r\n refuse us this favor.\r\n\r\n Receive, Mr. President, the assurance of our highest consideration.\r\n\r\n For the International Committee:\r\n\r\n  G. MOYNIER, President\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Garfield heard her story with genuine cordiality. He knew her\r\nand the work she had done both in this country and abroad. He assured\r\nher of his warm personal interest and referred her to the Secretary of\r\nState for a further discussion of the matter. His note was brief and to\r\nthe point:\r\n\r\n  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON\r\n\r\n Will the Sec’y of State please hear Miss Barton on the subject herein\r\n referred to?\r\n\r\n  J. A. GARFIELD\r\n\r\n  March 30, 1881\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was several days before Clara Barton succeeded in securing an\r\nappointment with Secretary Blaine; she did not want merely to present\r\nthe President’s note, but to have time to tell the story of the Red\r\nCross. Mr. Blaine agreed to see her on Monday, April 11, 1881. Her\r\nnephew, Stephen, who had come to Washington for a few days, accompanied\r\nher on this visit; and it is fully recorded in his diary. The beginning\r\nof the interview was not encouraging; for Mr. Blaine, after appointing\r\nthe time, apparently forgot about it, and was occupied when they called.\r\n\r\nThe appointment had been made for 11.30 at the Department of State.\r\nClara and Stephen waited for an hour in the Diplomatic Chamber. At the\r\nend of that time Mr. Blaine came in accompanied by Mrs. Dr. Loring, of\r\nMassachusetts. Introductions ensued, Mrs. Loring said she would “esteem\r\nit an honor to make the acquaintance of Miss Barton,” and arranged for\r\nan interchange of calls. Mr. Blaine referred to Miss Barton’s call\r\nat his residence, and “hoped it would not be the last.” Mrs. Loring\r\nthen withdrew, and Mr. Blaine apologized for having kept Miss Barton\r\nwaiting. She told him the nature of her visit and presented the letter\r\nof President Garfield. Mr. Blaine told her that he knew practically\r\nnothing about the Red Cross, and asked her to state briefly its object.\r\nHe thought it would come more clearly under the supervision of the\r\nSecretary of War, but she explained the necessity for the treaty. The\r\ninternational aspect of the organization had not previously occurred\r\nto Mr. Blaine; he had supposed it would be purely an American Society\r\noperating under the War Department; and that any encouragement given by\r\nthe Secretary of State would be incidental and personal; Miss Barton\r\nreplied that if he could give her time she would like to tell him in\r\ndetail what was involved in the relation of the United States to the\r\nRed Cross. He replied, “Miss Barton, I can give you all the time you\r\nneed.”\r\n\r\nClara then told him the whole story from beginning to end, and Mr.\r\nBlaine listened with intent interest.\r\n\r\nHe inquired why President Hayes had not pushed the matter to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion, and she told him of Mr. Seward’s objections\r\nwhich went back to his father’s secretaryship in Civil War days, and\r\nbased upon the Monroe Doctrine.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine replied that “the Monroe Doctrine was not made to ward off\r\nhumanity.” He told her that “the grounds for Mr. Seward’s objection\r\nwould not stand in the way of the present Administration.” He assured\r\nher that he was “in full sympathy with her proposal,” and promised\r\nher that he “would coöperate fully with her in carrying the matter\r\nsuccessfully through.” As for the official letter from M. Moynier,\r\nhe assured her that he would be prepared to reply to that letter\r\napprovingly now on the sole basis of her statement of the case; but he\r\nsaid that he wanted to do more than this.\r\n\r\nShe replied that she knew it would be necessary for the Senate to\r\napprove. He told her, “if it needed the action of the Senate, that\r\ncould be had.” The confidence with which he spoke was most reassuring.\r\nHe asked her to leave her little pamphlet with him for a few days\r\nthat he might become a little more familiar with the history of the\r\nmovement. It was all new to him; but it was obviously a thing in which\r\nthe United States should have its part with other nations; he could\r\npromise her that it would be done, and done promptly.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine suggested that it would be well for Miss Barton to talk over\r\nthe matter of the Red Cross with the Secretary of War. On the following\r\nday she went by appointment to see Secretary Robert T. Lincoln. Again\r\nStephen accompanied her and made a record of it.\r\n\r\nMiss Barton first expressed to Mr. Lincoln her appreciation of the\r\nkindness of his father. Stephen wrote, “He was much affected and very\r\ngrateful.”\r\n\r\nThe adhesion of the United States to the treaty was a matter for the\r\nState Department; but Robert Lincoln was greatly interested, and\r\nassured Miss Barton of his support in the operation of the Red Cross in\r\ncase the Administration agreed to it.\r\n\r\nIn the next few days she made calls on other members of the Cabinet.\r\nNowhere did she encounter opposition or apathy. The interest of\r\nPresident Garfield and Secretary Blaine appeared to be contagious. All\r\nofficial Washington seemed suddenly to have wakened to the importance\r\nof the Red Cross. She called upon several Senators and was introduced\r\nby Senator Conger, who told them of Clara Barton’s work in Michigan.\r\nWith this introduction and a knowledge of the President’s approval,\r\nthey met her with prompt and unreserved approval of her plans. Most of\r\nthem had never heard of the Red Cross, but, when she told them how many\r\nother nations had approved it, and that the President and Secretary of\r\nState were ready to approve the treaty, they gave her on the spot their\r\nheartiest endorsement. She thought she understood Secretary Blaine’s\r\ncomplete confidence that the Senate would ratify the treaty as a matter\r\nof course.\r\n\r\nMore than a month elapsed before anything else occurred. Nothing\r\nunfavorable developed. On the other hand, neither the President nor Mr.\r\nBlaine took any immediate steps. The Conkling difficulty had arisen and\r\nboth Garfield and Blaine had many other things to think about. Clara\r\nBarton began to wonder whether she could induce the Senate to remind\r\nthe Secretary of State of his interest in the matter.\r\n\r\nOn May 17, 1881, the Honorable Omar D. Conger, of Michigan, submitted\r\nto the United States Senate the following resolution:\r\n\r\n RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be requested to furnish to the\r\n Senate copies (translations) of the Articles of Convention signed at\r\n Geneva, Switzerland, August 22, 1864, touching the treatment of those\r\n wounded in war, together with the forms of ratification employed by\r\n the several Governments, parties thereto.\r\n\r\nIt took a little time for the Department of State to gather the\r\ndocuments necessary to answer the request of the Senate. But Secretary\r\nBlaine did not wait for this formality. He remembered that there was\r\nan earnest little woman awaiting some definite answer from him, and he\r\nsent her the following letter:\r\n\r\n  DEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n  WASHINGTON, May 20, 1881\r\n\r\n  MISS CLARA BARTON\r\n  American Representative of the Red Cross, etc.\r\n  Washington.\r\n\r\n  DEAR MADAM:\r\n\r\n I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the letter addressed\r\n by Mr. Moynier, President of the Red Cross International Convention,\r\n to the President of the United States, bearing the date of the 19th\r\n August, 1877, and referred by president Garfield on the 30th March,\r\n 1881, to this Department.\r\n\r\n It appears from a careful perusal of the letter that Mr. Moynier is\r\n anxious that the Government of the United States should join with\r\n other Governments of the world in this International Convention.\r\n\r\n Will you be pleased to say to Mr. Moynier, in reply to his letter,\r\n that the President of the United States and the officers of this\r\n Government are in full sympathy with anywise measures tending\r\n toward the amelioration of the suffering incident to warfare? The\r\n Constitution of the United States has, however, lodged the entire\r\n war-making power in the Congress of the United States; and as the\r\n participation of the United States in an International Convention of\r\n this character is consequent upon and auxiliary to the war-making\r\n power of the Nation, legislation by Congress is needful to accomplish\r\n the humane end that your society has in view. It gives me, however,\r\n great pleasure to state that I shall be happy to give any measures\r\n which you may propose careful attention and consideration, and\r\n should the President, as I doubt not he will, approve of the matter,\r\n the Administration will recommend to Congress the adoption of the\r\n international treaty which you desire.\r\n\r\n I am, madam, with very great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n  JAMES G. BLAINE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to know just how Clara Barton received the\r\nnews. Unfortunately, her diary affords us no information. She must have\r\ngone forth from the office of the Secretary of State with wings upon\r\nher feet. There still would be months before Congress could act, but\r\nshe sent the glad news at once to President Moynier and received from\r\nhim an official reply which she transmitted to the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n  GENEVA, June 13, 1881\r\n\r\n  _To the Honorable the Secretary of State_\r\n  JAMES G. BLAINE, _Washington_\r\n\r\n SIR: Miss Clara Barton has just communicated to me the letter which\r\n she has had the honor to receive from you, bearing date of May 23,\r\n 1881, and I hasten to express to you how much satisfaction I have\r\n experienced from it. I do not doubt now, thanks to your favorable\r\n consideration and that of President Garfield, that the United States\r\n may soon be counted among the number of signers of the Geneva\r\n Convention, since you have been kind enough to allow me to hope that\r\n the proposition for it will be made to Congress by the Administration.\r\n\r\n I thank you, as well as President Garfield, for having been willing\r\n to take into serious consideration the wish contained in my letter of\r\n August 19, 1877, assuredly a very natural wish, since it tended to\r\n unite your country with a work of charity and civilization for which\r\n it is one of the best qualified.\r\n\r\n Since my letter of 1877 was written, several new governmental\r\n adhesions have been given to the Geneva Convention, and I think that\r\n these precedents will be much more encouraging to the United States\r\n from the fact that they have been given by America. It was under the\r\n influence of events of the recent war of the Pacific that Bolivia\r\n signed the treaty the 16th of October, 1879, Chili on the 15th of\r\n November, 1879, Argentine Republic on the 25th of November, 1879, and\r\n Peru on the 22d of April, 1881. This argument in favor of the adhesion\r\n of your country is the only one I can add to my request, and to the\r\n printed documents that Miss Barton has placed in your hands, to aid\r\n your judgment and that of Congress.\r\n\r\n I now await with full confidence the final result of your sympathetic\r\n efforts, and I beg you to accept, sir, the assurance of my high\r\n consideration.\r\n\r\n  G. MOYNIER, President\r\n\r\n\r\nThere lies before me as I write a little pad of paper, about three\r\nby five inches in size, of which more than half the sheets have been\r\nused and torn off, and of the remainder all but the top six leaves\r\nare blank. Those six pages are filled with writing in pencil, and\r\nthe writing is that of Clara Barton. It is just such a pad as she\r\nhabitually kept by her hard and narrow cot, with a candle and a pencil\r\nat hand, so that when she woke in the night she might sit up and\r\nwrite the thoughts that came to her. She seldom retired before eleven\r\no’clock, and was habitually up as early as five, but if she had waking\r\nhours between, and she often had them, she wrote down what was in her\r\nmind, put out the candle, and finished what was for her a good night’s\r\nrest by sunrise or before.\r\n\r\n“In almost any part of the world except the United States,” the tablet\r\nbegins, “the words Red Cross, and the emblem for which they stand,\r\nwould be as familiar as are to us the words Internal Revenue or\r\nNational Board of Health.”\r\n\r\nWas there ever such a time? Most of us have forgotten whether there is\r\na National Board of Health, but “the words Red Cross, and the emblem\r\nfor which they stand,” have become as familiar as the Stars and Stripes.\r\n\r\nYet there was a time when all other countries knew of it, but in the\r\nUnited States we knew of Internal Revenue and of the National Board of\r\nHealth, but not of the Red Cross!\r\n\r\nThe little tablet is not dated, but I have no difficulty in supplying\r\nthe date. These six pages were penciled on a night between June 9 and\r\nJuly 1, 1881. They appear to have been intended as the basis of an\r\narticle for the Associated Press, endeavoring to call a little more\r\nattention to the fact that on May 21 of that year the American Red\r\nCross had actually been organized and that on June 9 it had elected\r\nofficers. The Associated Press had sent out a paragraph announcing the\r\norganization, May 21, and this was to tell that “A subsequent meeting\r\nhas been held, and the following officers elected: President, Miss\r\nClara Barton; secretary, George Kennan,” and so on. She might have\r\ntold, but did not, that her own name as president was presented by\r\nPresident Garfield himself.\r\n\r\nShe had to explain what the Red Cross was for, although “During the\r\nlast three or four years the public eye has been growing familiar with\r\nthe term,” through constant efforts to secure for it such recognition\r\nin America as it long had had abroad.\r\n\r\n“Nation after nation has recognized its benign mission,” the narrative\r\nruns on, “until twenty-seven countries have welcomed, received, and\r\nincorporated its humane principle into laws which govern their rules of\r\nwarfare. In twenty-seven lands, wherever the national emblem is thrown\r\nto the breeze in token of war, there floats beside it this beautiful\r\nemblem of mercy, pity, justice, charity, and neutral care for the\r\nwounded, comfort for the dying, and burial for the dead. To us alone it\r\nis a stranger. For seventeen years it has knocked at our door, but our\r\ngreat, noisy family failed to hear.”\r\n\r\nThat was her first great triumph!\r\n\r\nSo she obtained her official recognition, and then on the very next\r\nday held her meeting for organization, and that fall secured her\r\nincorporation, and the next year the treaty, and so on, and so on, one\r\nstep leading to another; and when she had gotten the consent of the\r\nWhite House, she undertook to educate the great American Republic, and\r\nlet them know what the Red Cross stood for. She hoped the time would\r\ncome when the name and symbol would be as well known in America as the\r\nwords Internal Revenue or National Board of Health.\r\n\r\nShe had no publicity organization, nor press committee; but one night\r\nshe sat up in bed, lighted her candle, took her little pad and pencil,\r\nand began to write:\r\n\r\n“In almost any part of the world except the United States of America\r\nthe words Red Cross, and the emblem for which it stands, would be as\r\nfamiliar--” and so on.\r\n\r\nShe did not finish the article in this form, though I find what use\r\nshe made of it later in that year, in a pamphlet entitled “A Sketch of\r\nthe History of the Red Cross.” That document was reissued with added\r\nmaterial in 1883, after the adoption of the international treaty. The\r\ntwo lie before me, the completed pamphlet, with the endorsement of\r\nSecretary Blaine, and the nomination, by President Garfield himself,\r\nof Clara Barton to be president of the American Red Cross Association,\r\nand the three-cent pencil tablet on which Clara Barton began, on one\r\nnight very soon after June 9, 1881, to teach the great American people\r\nwhat the words Red Cross and its emblem were intended to represent. She\r\nwas not much given to weeping, but her tears would have wet through\r\nthe little pad of paper many times before she accomplished what she\r\nundertook. But she succeeded. She lived to see the name and emblem\r\nof the Red Cross as familiar in her own country as in any of the\r\ntwenty-seven that had previously adopted it. And that was what she\r\nhoped and prayed to do.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that all these documents from the President and the\r\nSecretary of State, on the one hand, and from President Moynier and\r\nDr. Appia on the other, are addressed to Clara Barton. So far as is\r\nnow known there was no other person in America to whom they might have\r\nbeen properly addressed. From the time when she returned from the\r\nFranco-Prussian War until the President and the Congress of the United\r\nStates had officially approved the Red Cross, and the Senate had agreed\r\nto the Treaty of Geneva, there was, so far as is known, precisely one\r\nRed Cross in the United States, and that was the one which Clara Barton\r\nhad brought back from the red fields of France.\r\n\r\nNot only so, but so far as is now known, in all those years no other\r\nvoice than hers, after Dr. Bellows gave up hope, was raised on behalf\r\nof it. No one else had a vision of its possible relation to the future\r\nlife of the United States. One little woman, barely recovered from her\r\nnervous prostration, trudged wearily from desk to desk in Washington,\r\nand with voice and pen pleaded in season and out of season until the\r\nAmerican Red Cross became a fact.\r\n\r\nYes, the American Red Cross was now a fact. The President had\r\nconsented; the Secretary of State had become an enthusiastic\r\nprotagonist of the treaty; the Secretary of War heartily favored it;\r\nand the entire Senate appeared a unit in its favor. The preliminary\r\nresolution had passed the Senate without a single dissenting voice.\r\nThere were certain formalities which needed to be completed before the\r\ntreaty could actually be signed and ratified, but that was not worth\r\nworrying about. President Garfield and Secretary Blaine encouraged Miss\r\nBarton to go straight ahead and complete her organization.\r\n\r\nShe asked President Garfield to become the president of the American\r\nRed Cross, but he declined. She told him that in other countries kings\r\nand chief magistrates were its presidents; but President Garfield\r\nthought he knew a person to whom that honor belonged in America. When\r\nthe American Red Cross was actually organized, Clara Barton was made\r\nits president on nomination of James A. Garfield, President of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nOn the very next day after receipt of Secretary Blaine’s letter, Clara\r\nBarton held a meeting and organized a National Society of the Red\r\nCross. The society was duly and promptly incorporated under the laws of\r\nthe District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nAt a subsequent meeting, held on the 9th of June, 1881, the following\r\nofficers were elected:\r\n\r\n  Miss Clara Barton, _President_.\r\n  Judge William Lawrence, _First Vice-President_.\r\n  Dr. Alexander Y. P. Garnett, _Vice-President of the District of\r\n   Columbia_.\r\n  A. S. Solomons, _Treasurer_.\r\n  George Kennan, _Secretary_.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE BOARD\r\n\r\n  Judge William Lawrence, _Chairman_.\r\n  Dr. George B. Loring.\r\n  Gen. S. D. Sturgis.\r\n  Mrs. S. A. Martha Canfield.\r\n  Mr. Walter P. Phillips.\r\n  Miss Clara Barton.\r\n  Mr. Walker Blaine.\r\n  Col. Richard J. Hinton.\r\n  Mrs. F. B. Taylor.\r\n  Mr. Wm. F. Sliney.\r\n  Mr. John R. Van Wormer.\r\n  Gen. R. D. Mussey, _Consulting Counsel of the Association_.\r\n  Miss Clara Barton, _Corresponding Secretary_.\r\n\r\nNothing could have seemed more auspicious than the outlook of the\r\nAmerican Red Cross on the day of its organization. It had the support\r\nof the President, his Cabinet, and the Senate, and its birth was hailed\r\nwith satisfaction by all civilized nations. The signing and approval\r\nof the treaty appeared a trivial formality.\r\n\r\nJust when everything was proceeding finely, President Garfield was shot\r\nby a fanatic on July 2, 1881. He lingered through the summer, and on\r\nSeptember 19th he died.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cross Treaty had not been signed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE TRIALS OF A TREATY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe methods of treaty-making in the United States have varied. In\r\na few instances the Senate has taken the initiative and asked the\r\nPresident’s concurrent action. In at least one instance the President\r\nhas negotiated the treaty without the assistance of the Senate and\r\nrequested the Senate to adopt it without change. In several cases the\r\ncoördinate treaty-making powers have moved together, the President\r\nconcurring with the Senate’s Committee on Foreign Relations. In the\r\nmatter of the Red Cross Treaty, as we have seen, the President took the\r\ninitiative in coöperation with the Secretary of State, and the Senate\r\nin due time requested the Secretary of State to submit the documents\r\nbearing upon the matter. This was the status when President Garfield\r\nwas shot. During the weeks of his illness the Nation’s interest\r\ncentered in his sick-room.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to know that the first local organization of the Red\r\nCross was established at Dansville, New York. Clara Barton returned\r\nthither after the shooting of President Garfield, and without waiting\r\nfor his death or recovery, called the people of that village together\r\nand established a local organization, the first in the United States.\r\nSome years afterward the Dansville “Express” went back over its files\r\nand found material for this brief article:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RED CROSS IN DANSVILLE\r\n\r\n_The First Local Society in the United States was Organized in\r\nDansville_\r\n\r\n From the files of the Dansville Express of Aug. 25, 1881, we find the\r\n first local Red Cross Society in the United States was organized in\r\n this village Aug. 22d, 1881, at a meeting held in St. Paul’s Lutheran\r\n Church, called for that purpose. Rev. P. A. Strobel, pastor of the\r\n church, presided and Dr. B. P. Andrews acted as secretary. Miss Clara\r\n Barton, then a resident of Dansville, explained the objects of the\r\n society.\r\n\r\n Rev. Geo. K. Ward, Dr. J. H. Jackson, Rev. P. A. Strobel, Rev. A. P.\r\n Brush, Mrs. Mary R. Smith, and Mrs. James Faulkner, Jr., were made\r\n a committee to present a constitution, and they reported the same.\r\n Wm. Kramer and Dr. J. H. Jackson were a committee to secure names of\r\n members and 57 were recorded.\r\n\r\n The officers elected were: President--Geo. A. Sweet;\r\n vice-president--Mrs. Fanny B. Johnson; secretary--Mrs. Mary Colvin;\r\n treasurer--Jas. Faulkner, Jr., executive board--Miss Clara Barton,\r\n Major Mark J. Bunnell, G. Bastian, Jas. H. Jackson, Major E. H. Pratt,\r\n Mrs. Geo. Hartman, Thomas E. Gallagher, Wm. Kramer, Oscar Woodruff,\r\n Mrs. Reuben Whiteman, Mrs. L. Q. Galpin.\r\n\r\n Later, Major Bunnell was made secretary of the executive board and\r\n Hon. J. A. VanDerlip consulting counsel.\r\n\r\n The society was active in good works for a few years and when Miss\r\n Barton moved to Washington it was allowed to die.\r\n\r\nSoon after the inauguration of President Arthur, Clara Barton returned\r\nto Washington from a summer spent at Dansville. She was already\r\nacquainted with President Arthur; she had met him at the White House,\r\nand he had expressed interest in her undertaking. She now called on\r\nhim again and reminded him that President Garfield had promised her\r\nhis assistance; that there already had gone forth a letter signed by\r\nthe Secretary of State, committing the United States to the Red Cross\r\nTreaty; and that there still lay on the President’s desk the official\r\nrequest of the Senate for information concerning the Treaty of Geneva.\r\n\r\nPresident Arthur gave to Miss Barton a most cordial reception. He\r\nassured her of his own personal interest and of the obligation under\r\nwhich he felt to carry out every promise made by President Garfield.\r\nHe promised her to call the attention of the Senate to the matter in\r\nhis first address to Congress, and he kept his promise in the following\r\nparagraphs:\r\n\r\n I cannot too strongly urge upon you my conviction that every\r\n consideration of national safety, economy, and honor imperatively\r\n demands a thorough rehabilitation of our Navy.\r\n\r\n We have for many years maintained with foreign Governments the\r\n relations of honorable peace, and that such relations may be permanent\r\n is desired by every patriotic citizen of the Republic.\r\n\r\n But if we heed the teachings of history we shall not forget that in\r\n the life of every nation emergencies may arise when a resort to arms\r\n can alone save it from dishonor.\r\n\r\n No danger from abroad now threatens this people, nor have we any cause\r\n to distrust the friendly professions of other Governments.\r\n\r\n But, for avoiding as well as for repelling dangers that may threaten\r\n us in the future, we must be prepared to enforce any policy which we\r\n think wise to adopt.\r\n\r\n At its last extra session the Senate called for the text of the\r\n Geneva Convention for the relief of the wounded in war. I trust that\r\n this action foreshadows such interest in the subject as will result\r\n in the adhesion of the United States to that humane and commendable\r\n engagement.\r\n\r\nThis part of the message was immediately taken up in the Senate and\r\nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, consisting of the\r\nfollowing named gentlemen, to wit: Hon. William Windom, Minnesota;\r\nHon. George F. Edmunds, Vermont; Hon. John Miller, California; Hon.\r\nThomas W. Ferry, Michigan; Hon. Elbridge G. Lapham, New York; Hon.\r\nJohn W. Johnston, Virginia; Hon. J. T. Morgan, Alabama; Hon. George H.\r\nPendleton, Ohio; Hon. Benjamin H. Hill, Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Foreign Relations opened its door wide to Clara Barton\r\nand listened with the greatest interest to her story. President Arthur\r\nfollowed the recommendation of his message with a special communication\r\nin response to the Senate’s request of the preceding May:\r\n\r\n (Senate Ex. Doc. No. 6, 47th Congress, 1st Session)\r\n\r\n Message from the President of the United States, transmitting in\r\n response to Senate resolution of May 17th, 1881, a report of the\r\n Secretary of State, with accompanying papers, touching the Geneva\r\n Convention for the relief of the wounded in war.\r\n\r\nDecember 12, 1881.--Referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations and\r\nordered to be printed.\r\n\r\n_To Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in response to the resolution of the Senate of\r\nthe seventeenth of May last, a report of the Secretary of State, with\r\naccompanying papers, touching the Geneva Convention for the relief of\r\nthe wounded in war.\r\n\r\n  CHESTER A. ARTHUR\r\n\r\n  EXECUTIVE MANSION\r\n  WASHINGTON, _December 12, 1881_\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the President_:\r\n\r\n The Secretary of State, to whom was addressed a resolution of the\r\n Senate, dated the seventeenth of May, 1881, requesting him “to furnish\r\n to the Senate copies (translations) of Articles of Convention signed\r\n at Geneva, Switzerland, August 22, 1864, touching the treatment of\r\n those wounded in war, together with the forms of ratification employed\r\n by the several governments, parties thereto,” has the honor to lay\r\n before the President the papers called for by the resolution.\r\n\r\n In view of the reference made, in the annual message of the\r\n President, to the Geneva convention, the Secretary of State deems it\r\n unnecessary now to enlarge upon the advisability of the adhesion of\r\n the United States to an international compact at once so humane in its\r\n character and so universal in its application as to commend itself to\r\n the adoption of nearly all the civilized powers.\r\n\r\n  JAMES G. BLAINE\r\n\r\n  DEPARTMENT OF STATE\r\n  WASHINGTON, _December 10, 1881_\r\n\r\n\r\nWith such support from the President and the Secretary of State,\r\nand with the Senate a unit in support of the treaty, the end of the\r\nstruggle appeared to be in sight. But many anxious months had yet to\r\npass before Clara Barton’s dream came true.\r\n\r\nEven after the movement was inaugurated and recognized by Congress,\r\nvery few people in America attached to it any considerable degree of\r\nimportance. Among those who appreciated its full significance and\r\nhastened to give Clara Barton full credit for her splendid achievement\r\nwas the man who had labored so faithfully for the organization of an\r\nAmerican Red Cross at the close of the Civil War, Dr. Henry W. Bellows.\r\nHe had labored in earlier years and had given it up, but rejoiced in\r\nthe prospect of her success:\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK, 232 E. 15\r\n  Nov. 21, 1881\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR MISS BARTON:\r\n\r\n It has been a sore disappointment and mortification to those who\r\n inaugurated the plan of organized relief, by private contributions,\r\n for sick and wounded soldiers in our late war, since so largely\r\n followed by other nations, that they should still find the United\r\n States the _only_ great Government that refuses to join in the treaty,\r\n framed by the International Convention of Geneva, for neutralizing\r\n battle-fields after the battle, and making the persons of surgeons\r\n and nurses flying to the relief of the wounded and dying free from\r\n arrest. This great international agreement for mitigating the horrors\r\n of war finds its chief defect in the conspicuous refusal of the\r\n United States Government to join in the treaty! The importance of our\r\n national concurrence with other Governments in this noble treaty has\r\n been urged upon every administration since the war, but has thus far\r\n met only the reply that our national policy did not allow us to enter\r\n into entangling alliances with other powers. I rejoice to hear from\r\n you that our late President and his chief official advisers were of a\r\n different opinion, and encouraged the hope that in the interests of\r\n mercy and humanity it might be safe to agree by treaty with all the\r\n civilized world, that we would soften to non-combatants the hateful\r\n conditions that made relief to the wounded on battle-fields a peril\r\n or forbidden act. I trust you will press this matter upon our present\r\n administration with all the weight of your well-earned influence.\r\n Having myself somewhat ignominiously failed to get any encouragement\r\n for this measure from two administrations, I leave it, in your more\r\n fortunate hands, hoping that the time is ripe for a less jealous\r\n policy than American self-isolation in international movements for\r\n extending and universalizing mercy towards the victims of war.\r\n\r\n  Yours truly\r\n  H. W. BELLOWS\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic sentiment in America is a strange and somewhat capricious thing.\r\nClara Barton issued her little booklet in 1878 and it appeared to fall\r\nflat. The newspapers paid no attention to it; Congress treated it with\r\ncomplete indifference if not with hostility, and the President and his\r\nCabinet ignored it. She reissued it in 1881 with added matter, and\r\nnot less than three hundred newspapers and periodicals spoke kindly\r\nof it, many of them more than once, so that more than five hundred\r\npress clippings were collated as the result of that and Miss Barton’s\r\nlittle article written for the Associated Press. Congress, that had\r\nbeen partly hostile and where not hostile apathetic, became suddenly\r\nand unanimously interested. The Honorable William Windom, Chairman of\r\nthe Committee on Foreign Relations, and afterward a member of President\r\nGarfield’s Cabinet, became a stanch friend, perhaps the first genuinely\r\ninterested and largely influential friend of the movement. Senators\r\nHoar and Wilson, of Massachusetts, and Hawley, of Connecticut, and\r\nEdmunds, of Vermont, lent to the movement intelligent and vigorous\r\nsupport. The Honorable Omar D. Conger, of Michigan, first in the\r\nHouse and afterward in the Senate, took an active part in promoting\r\nthe cause. When the matter began to be discussed in Congress as the\r\nbody which alone could declare war, and later came before the Foreign\r\nRelations Committee of the Senate on the proposal to ratify the Geneva\r\nTreaty, there was not a dissenting voice in either house, nor was\r\nthere in the press through the country, so far as is known, a single\r\nunfavorable comment. Clara Barton’s campaign of publicity had been a\r\nlittle handful of corn upon the top of the mountains and the fruit\r\nthereof shook like the Cedars of Lebanon. The whole Nation was suddenly\r\nconverted to faith in the Red Cross.\r\n\r\nForeign nations stood in amazement when they saw this change of\r\nsentiment. They were unable to account for it, nor could any one else\r\nexplain it to them. After eighteen years of indifference and hostility\r\nAmerica came over to the banner of the Red Cross with whole-hearted\r\nacceptance of its humane principles.\r\n\r\nBut still the question was asked why America need concern herself with\r\nan organization for war, when she was never going to have another war.\r\nThe answer to this question contained one of the distinctive principles\r\nof the American Red Cross as compared with the Red Cross in other\r\ncountries. In Europe, the Red Cross was organized solely for relief in\r\ntime of war. In America, it was organized to meet any great public need.\r\n\r\nAs yet, however, the Red Cross was proceeding without official\r\nauthority. The death of President Garfield delayed for several months\r\nthe official adherence of the United States to the Treaty of Geneva.\r\nMeantime, the Red Cross was in existence, by advice of President\r\nGarfield. It had, however, only a single local organization, but it\r\ncherished national and international aims and hopes. Miss Barton\r\nherself recorded the history of the organization:\r\n\r\n The National Red Cross of America was formed nearly a year before the\r\n accession to the treaty. This was done by the advice of President\r\n Garfield, in order to aid as far as possible the accession.\r\n “Accordingly a meeting was held in Washington, D.C., May 21, 1881,\r\n which resulted in the formation of an association to be known as the\r\n American National Association of the Red Cross.”\r\n\r\n Several years of previous illness on the part of its president had\r\n resulted in fixing her country home at Dansville, New York, the seat\r\n of the great Jackson and Austin Sanitarium and the acknowledged\r\n foundation of the hundreds of health institutions of that kind which\r\n bless the country to-day. The establishment of the National Red Cross\r\n in Washington had attracted the attention of persons outside, who,\r\n of course, knew very little of it; but among others, the people of\r\n Dansville, the home of the president, felt that if she were engaged\r\n in some public movement, they too might at least offer to aid.\r\n Accordingly, on her return to them in midsummer, they waited upon\r\n her with a request to that effect, which resulted in the formation\r\n of a society of the Red Cross, this being the first body in aid of\r\n the National Association formed in the United States. It is possible\r\n I cannot make that more clear than by giving an extract from their\r\n report of that date, which was as follows:\r\n\r\n In reply to your request, given through the secretary of your\r\n association, that we make report to you concerning the inauguration\r\n of our society, its subsequent proceedings and present condition, the\r\n committee has the honor to submit the following statement:\r\n\r\n Dansville, Livingston County, New York, being the country residence\r\n of Miss Clara Barton, president of the American Association of the\r\n Red Cross, its citizens, desirous of paying a compliment to her, and\r\n at the same time of doing an honor to themselves, conceived the idea\r\n of organizing in their town the first local society of the Red Cross\r\n in the United States. To this end, a general preliminary meeting was\r\n held in the Presbyterian Church, when the principles of the Treaty of\r\n Geneva and the nature of its societies were defined in a clear and\r\n practical manner by Miss Barton, who had been invited to address the\r\n meeting. Shortly after, on the twenty-second of August, 1881, a second\r\n meeting, for the purpose of organization, held in the Lutheran Church\r\n and presided over by the pastor, Rev. Dr. Strobel, was attended by the\r\n citizens generally, including nearly all the religious denominations\r\n of the town, with their respective pastors. The purpose of the meeting\r\n was explained by your president, a constitution was presented and very\r\n largely signed, and officers were elected.\r\n\r\n Thus we are able to announce that on the eighteenth anniversary of\r\n the Treaty of Geneva, in Switzerland, August 22, 1864, was formed the\r\n first local society of the Red Cross in the United States of America.\r\n\r\nWhile the Red Cross hung, like the coffin of Mohammed, between heaven\r\nand earth, a disastrous forest fire occurred in Michigan. Clara Barton\r\nat once issued, in the name of the Red Cross, an appeal for help. The\r\nfirst city to respond was Rochester, forty miles from Dansville, and\r\nSyracuse followed. The money was placed in the hands of the County\r\nClerk of Livingston County, New York, who went at once to Michigan,\r\nand distributed financial help under direction of Clara Barton. She\r\nalso went to Michigan, and took care of the distribution of food and\r\nclothing.\r\n\r\nHere, in Michigan, for the first time on American soil, the banner of\r\nthe Red Cross was displayed above the supply tent of Clara Barton. A\r\npart of the report of that first effort follows:\r\n\r\n Before a month had passed, before a thought of practical application\r\n to business had arisen, we were forcibly and sadly taught again the\r\n old lesson that we need but to build the altar, God will Himself\r\n provide the sacrifice. If we did not hear the crackling of the\r\n flames, our skies grew murky and dark and our atmosphere bitter with\r\n the drifting smoke that rolled over from the blazing fields of our\r\n neighbors of Michigan, whose living thousands fled in terror, whose\r\n dying hundreds writhed in the embers, and whose dead blackened in\r\n the ashes of their hard-earned homes. Instantly we felt the help and\r\n strength of our organization, young and untried as it was. We were\r\n grateful that in this first ordeal your sympathetic president was with\r\n us. We were deeply grateful for your prompt call to action, given\r\n through her, which rallied us to our work. Our relief rooms were\r\n instantly secured and our white banner, with its bright scarlet cross,\r\n which has never been furled since that hour, was thrown to the breeze,\r\n telling to every looker-on what we were there to do, and pointing to\r\n every generous heart an outlet for its sympathy. We had not mistaken\r\n the spirit of our people; our scarce-opened doorway was filled with\r\n men, women, and children bearing their gifts of pity and love. Tables\r\n and shelves were piled, our working committee of ladies took every\r\n article under inspection, their faithful hands made all garments whole\r\n and strong; lastly, each article received the stamp of the society and\r\n of the Red Cross, and all were carefully and quickly consigned to the\r\n firm packing-cases awaiting them. Eight large boxes were shipped at\r\n first, others followed directly, and so continued until notified by\r\n the Relief Committee of Michigan that no more were needed.\r\n\r\nAmong the fruits of Clara Barton’s work in Michigan was the confidence\r\nand friendship of Senator Omar D. Conger and of Mrs. Conger, who,\r\nseeing the actual workings of the Red Cross, under direct control of\r\nClara Barton, became its enthusiastic supporters, and her fast friends.\r\nThe Michigan experience also exhibited to the Nation the value of such\r\nan organization, and showed that a country which did not intend ever to\r\nhave another war might still find use for the Red Cross.\r\n\r\nBut still the treaty halted. No one was opposing it. Every known\r\ninfluence was favorable to it. Its adoption and signature were the\r\nmerest formality. Clara Barton was at liberty to go on with her work\r\nwith the full approval of the President and his Cabinet, and wait for\r\nthe adoption of the treaty which was certain to follow.\r\n\r\nIt did follow; but before it was adopted the heart of Clara Barton was\r\nwell-nigh broken. She had learned the weariness and pain of working\r\nalone; she was now to learn the keener sorrow which emerges when one\r\nundertakes to work with others.\r\n\r\nClara Barton had succeeded; no one questioned her success. But the\r\ntreaty was not yet adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE PERILS OF SUCCESS\r\n\r\n\r\nFew people now remember that Clara Barton’s success encountered any\r\ndifficulties at this point in her career. Her published writings\r\nmake no reference to them. Her book on the Red Cross tells the story\r\nas though events proceeded automatically through this period of\r\ntransition. President Garfield became interested and referred the\r\nmatter to Secretary Blaine, who became heartily enthusiastic, and he\r\nand President Garfield told her to proceed with assurance that the\r\nUnited States would approve the treaty. She did so, and, although\r\nPresident Garfield was shot, his successor made the promise good, and\r\nthe Senate unanimously concurred. That would seem to have been the\r\nwhole story. But, as a matter of fact the months that followed the\r\npublished approval of Secretary Blaine and President Garfield, and\r\nthe formal approval of the treaty, were among the most anxious and\r\nsorrowful of Clara Barton’s whole life.\r\n\r\nThe nation-wide publicity which now was freely accorded the movement\r\nintroduced Clara Barton to a new form of difficulty. She was well\r\nschooled in the discipline of disappointment and deferred hope. Now she\r\ncame to know of the embarrassments of success. Swiftly after the Red\r\nCross came to recognition there rose competing organizations, seeking\r\nto capitalize her success. The first day of August, 1881, saw the issue\r\nof Volume I, Number 1, of “The Red Cross.” It was a monthly magazine,\r\nof which there may have been no subsequent issues, the official\r\norgan of a society known as the Red Cross. It copied Clara Barton’s\r\nAssociated Press article, and said:\r\n\r\n We must say it is rather late for Miss Barton, or any one else, to\r\n talk about organizing the Red Cross.\r\n\r\nIt then proceeded to tell that this organization had been in existence\r\nsince 1879:\r\n\r\n We did not attempt to make this a national affair, as we were not in\r\n condition to do so. This country was not going to war, at any time,\r\n and the promoters first considered the propriety of getting the order\r\n on a good foundation. ’Tis true, we have not undertaken any public\r\n work as yet, but it is a very great undertaking when the territory to\r\n be gone over is taken into consideration. We have organized a body of\r\n men that no country in Europe can excel for the purpose of carrying\r\n out our objects.\r\n\r\nThe real and original Red Cross was, therefore, according to this\r\njournal, ready now to become national, and it warned Miss Clara Barton\r\nthat it had the right of way. It also published a portrait of the\r\nreal founder of the Red Cross, a gentleman born in England, who had\r\ncome to this country when young, and engaged in “several enterprises\r\nwhich proved successful,” none of which were named; studied law, but\r\ngave it up; studied medicine, but apparently did not practice. He was,\r\nhowever, according to this journal, a very great and widely known man;\r\nand his portrait showed him with so many badges and decorations upon\r\nhis right breast he would surely have had difficulty in drawing his\r\nsword. He was the “Organizer and Supreme Commander.” A “Grand Promenade\r\nConcert” was given in his honor in a very obscure hall in one of the\r\nAmerican cities, with a programme which the magazine printed in full,\r\nconsisting chiefly in a recitation (selected) by Miss Sadie Merryman;\r\na song (selected) by Miss Mary C. Andrews; a reading (selected) by\r\nMiss Mary Prescott; a piano solo (selected) by Miss Mary C. Andrews; a\r\nreading (selected) by Elmer E. Prescott, and selected songs with guitar\r\nby the Misses Biederman and father. Besides these there was an “Address\r\nof Welcome,” and a “Response” by the much-decorated “Organizer and\r\nSupreme Commander.”\r\n\r\nClara Barton had a sense of humor. She could not only smile but laugh\r\nheartily at competition of this bombastic character. She collected and\r\nfiled the literature, and it may be presumed that her files contain the\r\nonly preserved mementoes of this organization which served notice on\r\nher that her Red Cross was an innovation.\r\n\r\nBut, nevertheless, this was a warning, and one which she had\r\noccasion to heed. For immediately a considerable number of competing\r\norganizations sprang up in several parts of the country, and some of\r\nthem gave her great anxiety.\r\n\r\nShe was not superstitious, and apparently did not notice that the\r\nsecond Friday in January, 1882, fell on the 13th. But she recorded\r\nthat it was a bad Friday for her. Two days before, she had notice that\r\nthe wife of a United States Senator desired to call on her, and bring\r\none or two other ladies with her. She had moved into her new quarters\r\nthat very week, and not all her household goods were in place; so she\r\nhastened to put up her curtains and finish her unpacking; for it had\r\nrained on Monday when she expected to move, and her plans had been\r\ndisarranged.\r\n\r\nFriday afternoon the wife of the Senator came, and with her another\r\nlady.\r\n\r\n She said she had come partly on business; that she had some months\r\n before joined a society called the “Ladies’ National Red Star\r\n Association”;[2] that this society had a meeting this week, and the\r\n question of a counter-society came up; that this counter-society was\r\n said to be called the Red Cross, and appeared to have been organized\r\n to step in and do the work which they were doing; and it was decided\r\n to adjourn the meeting for one week to inform themselves in relation\r\n to this Red Cross Society. What was it? What did it propose to do?\r\n What had it done? She said she learned near the close of the meeting\r\n that I was the head of that society, and she came to ask if it was\r\n true, and what did the Red Cross have to say for itself?\r\n\r\n I told her I believed I was the head of the Society of which she\r\n wished to learn.\r\n\r\n She asked what Bills we proposed to present to Congress; and I told\r\n her, None.\r\n\r\n Why, yes, she said, they told her at the meeting that I had something\r\n before Congress.\r\n\r\n I told her I had a treaty, which I had presented for four years.\r\n\r\n She wanted to know what work we had done, and I told her of our work\r\n in Michigan.\r\n\r\n She said she knew nothing about the Red Cross; had seen something\r\n about it, but thought it was some Catholic thing; where did we get our\r\n authority? Was it a national thing? Had I anything published about it?\r\n\r\n I had a little pamphlet of two leaves, four years old. I gave her one.\r\n She said she was sorry not to get the information she came after.\r\n She left, evidently disappointed. I was sorry, also. I have no idea\r\n whether she came officially or at her own option, openly or as a spy.\r\n\r\nWhatever the motive of the wife of the Senator who came to Miss Barton,\r\nthe organization was one of which she had occasion to learn not a\r\nlittle. It was one that sprang up on the heels of her first success,\r\nand it crowded her hard before it was left behind and forgotten.\r\n\r\nClara Barton felt uneasy. The treaty was not yet ratified, and she knew\r\nnot how many wives of Senators were in this rival organization, pushed\r\nby ambitious women and seeking Government approval. Not very much of\r\nsuch competition at that stage of the affair would be necessary to kill\r\nthe treaty and the Red Cross. She went next day to see a man whose\r\njudgment she felt she could trust. She did not find him in his office,\r\nbut on Sunday he called on her:\r\n\r\n He had no special advice; was very busy. So are they all. All are\r\n busy; and I am to go on with this alone, as I plainly see. I shall\r\n make up my mind to let them all go, and I must gird myself for the\r\n work and go on with it by myself. I do not believe any member of my\r\n Society will be of any help to me in this hard work. They are all too\r\n busy.\r\n\r\nThe next day she went to the trial of Guiteau, and heard the closing\r\npleas. She was recognized, and given a seat inside the rail, and\r\n“treated with marked attention,” which gratified her. That afternoon\r\nshe went to see Senator Lapham, and asked him to take charge of the\r\ntreaty in the Senate, and he cheerfully consented. She told him frankly\r\nthat opposing organizations were already seeking recognition, but he\r\nencouraged her. A day or two later she saw Senator Windom, of the\r\nForeign Relations Committee, on whose support she had counted; and he\r\nseemed to her to have grown sad and distant, and she felt sure he had\r\nbeen approached by those who were opposing her.\r\n\r\nShe found, too, that her return to Washington, with its late dinners,\r\nwas not good for her. She resolved to forego heavy dinners; to eat her\r\nlast hearty meal at three o’clock, and enjoy a big red apple before\r\ngoing to bed. A big red apple was always a means of grace to Clara\r\nBarton. On one of the most desolate of these nights, when she came home\r\nlate in the rain after a disappointing day, she gratefully records that\r\nher apple was good.\r\n\r\nShe had cheering word about her finances. Her business affairs, left\r\nin the hands of reliable New York bankers, had prospered during her\r\nabsence abroad. She had used while in Europe considerably less than\r\nher income; her principal had swelled somewhat, and her annual income\r\nwas more by quite a little than she had expected. About the middle\r\nof January she received her complete account, and found that she had\r\nmore money than she thought; and this was a comfort. Her expenses at\r\nDansville, though much increased by her hospitality, had kept well\r\nwithin her annual receipts, and she was safely provided for for life.\r\nShe need never worry so far as money was concerned.\r\n\r\nBut she was worried. She began to question whether her dream of an\r\nAmerican Red Cross would ever come true. It was bitter hard to have\r\nit fail after she had won over three Presidents, Hayes, Garfield,\r\nand Arthur; but fail she thought it must, even after it had shown in\r\nMichigan how useful it could be. She seriously thought of returning to\r\nEurope, and letting some one else take up her thankless task. She wrote:\r\n\r\n I am so tired. I sleep very poorly. I can only think of some good\r\n way of getting out of this country. I feel as if I should be willing\r\n to let all go, if only I could get out, and hear no more strife and\r\n bickering lies. Why should I let my life be spoiled by those who are\r\n now opposing me, and who take the joy out of my sunshine?\r\n\r\nWhy, indeed? She had money enough to live upon, in Dansville, or in\r\nOxford, or for that matter in Washington; and she owned homes in each\r\nof those three places, and had income enough to live upon in any one of\r\nthem or in Europe. Why should she expose herself longer to weariness,\r\nmisrepresentation, and cruel disappointment?\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that Clara Barton had some reason to apprehend trouble\r\ngrowing out of the visit of the wife of the Senator. Powerful backing\r\nhad already been secured for the first of the opposing organizations\r\nthat gave her pain and sorrow.\r\n\r\nBut she prevailed, and the Senate at length ratified the treaty without\r\na dissenting vote. Either the Senator’s wife was more favorably\r\nimpressed than Clara Barton thought, or her husband refused to be\r\nguided by her opposition.\r\n\r\nBut the opponents of Clara Barton were active to the very hour when the\r\ntreaty was ratified, and there were days when it seemed that she was\r\nworking at a hopeless task. She went to see influential people, only to\r\nfind them out or occupied or indifferent or strangely uncommunicative.\r\nShe was almost in despair.\r\n\r\nThere came a day, Monday, February 6, 1882, when her own feelings\r\nchanged:\r\n\r\n It did not seem like other days. There was either much to do or\r\n nothing to do. I knelt at my bedside, and asked earnestly, tearfully,\r\n for guidance. I only want to know my way. I feel that I can walk it,\r\n if I can be made to see it. I am so weary of all this strife, this\r\n unrest, this doubt. I am willing to let the work go into other hands.\r\n If all goes as hoped, I can call an executive committee meeting,\r\n announce the ratification of the treaty, hand in my resignation, and\r\n get out of it all. If they want the Society, they can keep it; if not,\r\n it will die if let alone and some other can be organized, or they\r\n can take the one that is now opposing me. Then I can go and rest. It\r\n has been my part to do the work of the treaty. I have tried to do it\r\n faithfully, and it has met with little moral support, even from my own\r\n committee. I will try with God’s help to go on faithfully to the end,\r\n with no support but His; and if He will give it, when this is done,\r\n I shall be ready to lay the burden down, even if my enemies gain the\r\n advantage of it. This has been a day of instruction and discipline,\r\n and, I dare hope, not lost.\r\n\r\nShe went to the State Department. Mr. Adee reassured her. He did not\r\nthink there would be any trouble about the treaty, or that she need\r\nfear the opposition.\r\n\r\nShe had notice of the committee meeting, and she went to the Senate.\r\nShe was misdirected, and went to one or two wrong rooms, but finally\r\nfound the Committee on Foreign Relations, with Senator Windom in\r\nthe chair. He greeted her cordially, which surprised her after his\r\nrecent apparent coldness and evasiveness. He introduced her to Senator\r\nEdmunds, but that Senator insisted upon greeting her as an old friend.\r\nThey heard her with sympathy; took her little four-year-old two-leaved\r\ntract, and spoke no word about the opposition.\r\n\r\nA few days later Senator Lapham called and told her things were not\r\ngoing as well as he had hoped. Senator Windom, he said, was favorable,\r\nbut troubled. The matter seemed hung up at the State Department.\r\n\r\nShe told him she would go to the State Department herself and see what\r\nwas the trouble.\r\n\r\n“His good kind heart was touched, and his eyes were full.”\r\n\r\nHe did not know any other way than for her to do this. And so she went.\r\n\r\nShe was admitted immediately to the Department of State, and told\r\nconfidentially that it was all right. The Secretary of State had\r\nconferred with the President, and they were all ready to recommend the\r\ntreaty to the Senate.\r\n\r\nWould she like to see the treaty?\r\n\r\nWould she? Indeed, she would!\r\n\r\nIt must be a secret; unsigned documents were not supposed to be shown;\r\nbut the Secretary of State would be pleased to know whether this treaty\r\nwas exactly what she wanted.\r\n\r\nShe had never seen a treaty, and did not know what it looked like. It\r\nwas a volume, a kind of unbound book, of soft parchment, something like\r\nfourteen inches square. She sat down and read it, word for word, the\r\nSecretary of State watching her intermittently as he busied himself\r\nabout other matters. Line by line the full significance of it came\r\nover her. It quoted in full the text of the 1864 Convention, and\r\nrecited in effect the whole situation into which this would bring the\r\nUnited States in its relation to other nations. It was a great and\r\nsolemn document, such as she had never before handled; and her life\r\nand hope were bound up in it. At the very end were the formal words of\r\nratification, with blank spaces for the signature of the President and\r\nSecretary of State, and a place for the big seal of the United States\r\nof America.\r\n\r\n I had kept my eyes clear enough to read to the very end; but then I\r\n could hold up no longer, and how long a cry I indulged in, I do not\r\n know. But I know that it rested me; and after a while he stepped over\r\n and asked, very gently, “How does it suit you?” I told him it was\r\n all I could have hoped for, but I was ashamed to have done so badly\r\n myself. He, laughing, said that was all right. I asked him when it\r\n would be signed, and he said, “Any time, now.”\r\n\r\n At last it was done!\r\n\r\nWhy had she worried so much about it?\r\n\r\nShe worried because she knew there was reason to worry; and because\r\nthere were so few to worry; and because she did not know whether her\r\nworrying would do any good.\r\n\r\nFor it is necessary to tell a little, a very little, about why she\r\nworried.\r\n\r\nThere lie before me as I write certain letters written to Clara Barton\r\nby a woman who came to her in the latter part of her struggle to secure\r\nthe recognition of the Red Cross, and who wrote to Miss Barton that to\r\nbe associated with her in such work would be the crowning glory of her\r\nlife:\r\n\r\n I should think it a greater glory to be a doorkeeper in such a society\r\n as the Red Cross than to be--well, Mrs. President of the United\r\n States. If in the humblest way I can help you, I am at your service.\r\n There may be nothing for me to do, but if there is, command me.\r\n\r\nSadly, in after years, Clara Barton gathered up these and other\r\ndocuments, arranged them neatly in order, and endorsed them:\r\n\r\n The enclosed papers will serve to show in part what the Red Cross had\r\n to meet in its incipiency before we had the treaty. This woman had\r\n been our secretary and trusted friend, but by some means became a\r\n strong competitor, and organized an opposing society.\r\n\r\nThat is all she said about it; no word of bitterness or of\r\nself-justification. But this was not the only woman who rushed to her\r\nwhen she first gained publicity, proclaimed that she would be a servant\r\nof the servants of Clara Barton, learned all her confidential affairs,\r\nand then betrayed her.\r\n\r\nThis volume will make no catalogue of those who ate of her bread and\r\naccepted her confidences and who proved base and ungrateful. This\r\nparticular woman is mentioned because it seemed to Clara Barton that\r\nshe might very possibly defeat all that Clara Barton was working for.\r\nShe gained friends in high places, and she knew just whom Clara Barton\r\ncounted to be her friends, and how to approach some of them.\r\n\r\nThere lie before the author, also, certain anonymous letters, received\r\nat this time, some of them written in one city and sent to other cities\r\nto be mailed. There were also some vicious newspaper articles, one of\r\nthem first published in a remote Southern city, and later copied into\r\nWashington and Philadelphia papers, and these Clara Barton clipped,\r\nand labeled with the name of the person who, without any question, she\r\nbelieved to be their author. These and the anonymous letters and the\r\nletters of affection are all in the same package. Clara Barton arranged\r\nthem, and she thought she knew.\r\n\r\nNow, on the day that Clara Barton visited the office of the Secretary\r\nof State, she was so overjoyed that she went straight to the White\r\nHouse to thank the President. Mr. Arthur was not in, but her little\r\nnote was accepted by his secretary, who smiled and assured her that he\r\nunderstood, and that the President would be glad to receive it. And she\r\nwent home with a happy heart. And Senator Lapham sent her a big bouquet\r\nof roses that night.\r\n\r\nThe next Monday was the day set for Mr. Blaine to deliver the memorial\r\naddress on President Garfield, and she had a seat in the gallery of the\r\nHouse of Representatives; which was a much-coveted honor. She rose in\r\nfull expectation of going; and she went.\r\n\r\nBut at breakfast she received her mail; and there was a letter from her\r\nrival:\r\n\r\n It was the most abusive of all I have ever received from her. She\r\n charged me with all little meannesses, and warned me if I do not stop\r\n people’s tongues, she will take redress upon me, either through the\r\n press or by law.\r\n\r\n It had the effect to stun or daze me until I did not want to go to the\r\n Address. But I did go.\r\n\r\nThat was one of the things that was oppressing Clara Barton in those\r\ndays. That was why she was troubled when the wife of a Senator came\r\nto see her and ask whether there was such a thing as the Red Cross,\r\nand what it was, and why it was opposing another organization of which\r\nthe Senator’s wife was a member. That was why she was worried when the\r\nChairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations grew strangely distant.\r\n\r\nBut she went to hear Mr. Blaine, and she met prominent people, some of\r\nwhom knew her.\r\n\r\nTwo days later she had confidential tidings that the Senate Foreign\r\nRelations Committee had _unanimously_ approved the treaty, and that it\r\nwould doubtless be discussed in executive session of the Senate on the\r\nfollowing Tuesday.\r\n\r\nBut it hung on for another month, a month through which it was hard for\r\nher to go, but through which she went bravely.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, March 16, she felt as though hope was almost hopeless.\r\nShe “had no heart to speak” that day; “had more tears than words.” “It\r\nhas been a sad day.”\r\n\r\nShe wrote these words that evening, “weary and heart-sick”; but at this\r\npoint was interrupted by a note from Senator Lapham. The note will bear\r\nprinting:\r\n\r\n  U.S. SENATE CHAMBER\r\n  WASHINGTON, March 16, 1882\r\n\r\n  MISS BARTON:\r\n\r\n I have the gratifying privilege of informing you of the ratification\r\n by the Senate of the Geneva Convention; of the full assent of the\r\n United States to the same, by the action of the Senate this afternoon.\r\n I had the injunction of secrecy removed so that it could be published\r\n at once. The whole is in print, and if I get time I will send you some\r\n copies in the morning. I go home to-morrow to be gone a week.\r\n\r\n LAUS DEO!\r\n\r\n  Very truly\r\n\r\n  E. S. LAPHAM\r\n\r\n\r\nIt ought to have brought her joy; but she wrote:\r\n\r\n I had waited so long, and was so weak and broken, I could not even\r\n feel glad. I laid down the letter, and wiped my tired eyes.\r\n\r\nBefore she got to bed she had another sad tale to hear, of dissensions\r\namong those who should have been rejoicing with her, but were\r\ndispleased. And she went to bed ill.\r\n\r\nMany of the people who from this time came to Clara Barton with an\r\nearnest desire to be permitted to share in her labor were thoroughly\r\nand permanently loyal, and some of them are to this day among the\r\nforemost of those who hold her name in reverence. There were others,\r\nhowever, not less sincere, who were an embarrassment to her, coming in\r\nsome cases with a maximum of enthusiasm and a minimum of discretion.\r\nThere were still others who, after working with her long enough\r\nto gain her confidence, became fired with an ambition to organize\r\nsocieties of their own. There was a Blue Anchor Society, now entirely\r\nforgotten, but which caused her a great deal of anxiety. It was\r\nestablished by a woman whom she counted a sincere friend, who learned\r\nabout the Red Cross from Clara Barton and utilized her knowledge in the\r\nformation of a rival society which at one time threatened to be more\r\nprominent in high places than the Red Cross itself. Later there was\r\norganized a White Cross Society, which gained such recognition that, in\r\none of the Dewey parades at the end of the Spanish War, it was placed\r\nahead of the Red Cross. It had powerful friends, and the bill for its\r\nrecognition by Congress passed the Senate, but did not pass the House.\r\n\r\nThese rival organizations appear very puerile and futile now, but\r\nat the time they were a source of great anxiety to Clara Barton. It\r\nsometimes seemed to her that there were not many people whom she could\r\ntrust to maintain permanently high and unselfish motives like her own.\r\nIf she failed, as she was charged with failing, to share responsibility\r\nwith her associates, that failure had behind it some very unhappy\r\nexperiences that need not here be recorded.\r\n\r\nJust at the point when her success, as we now view it, was practically\r\nassured, she went one Saturday to call on an influential woman whose\r\nfriendship she had won in the work for the sufferers from the Michigan\r\nfires. Her heart sank within her when she found on this friend’s desk\r\nthe literature of an opposing organization with an invitation to join.\r\nShe wondered if this friend too would desert her, and she went home\r\ngreatly depressed. So far as that friend was concerned, her fears\r\nwere groundless. This woman and her husband had seen her work and\r\nthey remained loyal to her through life. The next day was a family\r\nanniversary, and it set her to remembering her childhood. She wrote in\r\nher diary that day:\r\n\r\n I wish I had always remained a little girl. I did not begin like\r\n other children; did not learn how to be a child, still less how to be\r\n a young girl and woman; and so had no knowledge of the right way to\r\n get on in society. I have made only mistakes, and have always been\r\n so sensitive that I could not bear the consequences of my mistakes.\r\n The longer I live the worse it gets, until now the menacing spirits\r\n hover about my poor beset pathway, darkening it with the shadows\r\n of approaching night; there is not a ray of brightness nor even of\r\n safety; they wait like robbers to see me far enough along to set upon\r\n me and slay me outright. But there is no way but to go on; I cannot\r\n hide. I wonder if it would not have been better if I had gone, the\r\n little five-year-old girl that was snatched from death? I often revert\r\n to that sharp illness, which I can remember, as the time when perhaps\r\n it would have been better if no remedy had been found. What years of\r\n unrest, pain to myself and to others it would have wiped out, and all\r\n the world would have been as well if not better! Looking at it as\r\n calmly as I am able and with my best judgment, I can only see failure\r\n of it all. There have been no successes in my life, only attempts at\r\n success and no realization.\r\n\r\nAt such times she felt her lack of experience in social matters. The\r\nwomen who organized these opposing societies were able to hold parlor\r\nmeetings in aristocratic homes; to organize committees with long lists\r\nof names of society women as patronesses; to secure publicity, and to\r\nenlist strong political influence. She wrote in her diary:\r\n\r\n I am very low-spirited. I am cold, alone, surrounded by harmful\r\n spirits. All the society people of the city and country seem to be\r\n arrayed in arms against me, with only my single hand, sore heart, and\r\n silent tongue to make my way against misrepresentation, malice, and\r\n selfish ambition.\r\n\r\nThese were some of the reasons why Clara Barton was not jubilant when\r\nher success finally came. She was too tired, too heart-sore to care\r\nvery much. She was weary of Washington, and she thought she was ready\r\nnow to go to one of her other homes and live the rest of her life\r\nin peace. The Red Cross was now an established fact; the treaty was\r\nsigned and ratified. She had only to hand in her resignation and leave\r\nthe work to be carried on by others; whether they were her enemies or\r\nfriends, she did not greatly care, her part was done.\r\n\r\nThat was what she said in her diary, but a few days later the meeting\r\noccurred for the perfecting of the organization in its new and\r\naccredited character. She went to the meeting only partially recovered\r\nfrom her depression, but she returned in high spirits. “This has\r\nbeen a red-letter day for me,” she wrote; “the meeting was largely\r\nattended.” Quite a number of prominent people seemed eager to sign the\r\nconstitution and become members of her organization. The cry from the\r\nflooded district along the Mississippi was loud and strong; there was\r\nwork to be done immediately; it was no time for Clara Barton to resign.\r\nShe wrote no more of the cruel things which she had been suffering, but\r\nwent straight forward in her work of relief. It was many years before\r\nshe had time to think again of resigning.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of March, 1882, the President, by his signature, gave\r\nthe accession of the United States to the Treaty of Geneva of August\r\n22, 1864, and also to that of October 20, 1868, and transmitted to the\r\nSenate the following message, declaration, and proposed adoption of\r\nthe same:\r\n\r\n Message from the President of the United States, transmitting an\r\n accession of the United States to the Convention concluded at\r\n Geneva on the twenty-second August, 1864, between various powers,\r\n for the amelioration of the wounded of armies in the field, and to\r\n the additional articles thereto, signed at Geneva on the twentieth\r\n October, 1868.\r\n\r\n March 3, 1882.--Read; accession read the first time referred to the\r\n Committee on Foreign Relations, and, together with the message,\r\n ordered to be printed in confidence, for the use of the Senate.\r\n\r\n March 16, 1882.--Ratified and injunction of secrecy removed therefrom.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate for its action thereon, the accession\r\nof the United States to the convention concluded at Geneva on\r\nthe twenty-second August, 1864, between various powers, for the\r\namelioration of the wounded of armies in the field, and to the\r\nadditional articles thereto, signed at Geneva on the twentieth of\r\nOctober, 1868.\r\n\r\n  CHESTER A. ARTHUR\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, March 3, 1882\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, on the twenty-second day of August, 1864, a convention was\r\nconcluded at Geneva, in Switzerland, between the Grand Duchy of Baden\r\nand the Swiss Confederation, the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of\r\nDenmark, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Empire, the Grand Duchy\r\nof Hesse, the Kingdom of Italy, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the\r\nKingdom of Portugal, the Kingdom of Prussia, and the Kingdom of\r\nWürtemberg, for the amelioration of the wounded in armies in the field,\r\nthe tenor of which convention is as follows!\r\n\r\n[Here followed the treaty and additional articles.]\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, the President of the United States of America, by\r\nand with the advice and consent of the Senate, hereby declares that\r\nthe United States accede to the said convention of the twenty-second\r\nAugust, 1864, and also accede to the said convention of October 20,\r\n1868.\r\n\r\nDone at Washington this first day of March in the year of our Lord one\r\nthousand eight hundred and eighty-two, and of the Independence of the\r\nUnited States the one hundred and sixth.\r\n\r\n(Seal) CHESTER A. ARTHUR By the President: FRED’K T. FRELINGHUYSEN\r\nSecretary of State\r\n\r\nWhen the Senate finally took favorable action and President Arthur\r\nadded his signature, Clara Barton did not wait for mail, but cabled the\r\njoyful news to Geneva, and received in reply the following official\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n  GENEVA, _March 24, 1882_\r\n\r\n  MISS CLARA BARTON\r\n\r\n  _President of the American Society of the Red Cross_\r\n\r\n MADEMOISELLE: At last, on the 17th instant, I received your glorious\r\n telegram. I delayed replying to it in order to communicate its\r\n contents to my colleagues of the International Committee, so as to\r\n be able to thank you in the name of all of us and to tell you of\r\n the joy it gives us. You must feel happy, too, and proud to have at\r\n last attained your object, thanks to a perseverance and a zeal which\r\n surmounted every obstacle.\r\n\r\n Please, if opportunity offers, to be our interpreter with President\r\n Arthur and present him our warmest congratulations.\r\n\r\n I suppose your Government will now notify the Swiss Federal Council of\r\n its decision in the matter, and the latter will then inform the other\r\n Powers which have signed the Red Cross Treaty.\r\n\r\n Only after this formality shall have been complied with can we occupy\r\n ourselves with fixing the official international status of your\r\n society. We have, however, already considered the circular which we\r\n intend to address to all the societies of the Red Cross, and with\r\n regard thereto we have found that it will be necessary for us as a\r\n preliminary measure to be furnished with a document certifying that\r\n your society has attained the second of its objects, i.e., that it has\r\n been (officially) recognized by the American Government.\r\n\r\n It is important that we be able to certify that your Government is\r\n prepared to accept your services in case of war; that it will readily\r\n enter into cooperation with you and will encourage the centralization\r\n under _your direction_ of all the voluntary aid. We have no doubt that\r\n you will readily obtain from the competent authorities an official\r\n declaration to that effect, and we believe that this matter will be\r\n merely a formality, but we attach the greatest importance to the\r\n fact in order to cover our responsibility, especially in view of the\r\n pretensions of rival societies which might _claim_ to be acknowledged\r\n by us.\r\n\r\n It is your society alone and none other that we will patronize,\r\n because it inspires us with confidence and we would be placed in a\r\n false position if you failed to obtain for it a privileged position by\r\n a formal recognizance of the Government.\r\n\r\n We hope that you will appreciate the motives of caution which guide us\r\n in this matter, and that you may soon enable us to act in the premises.\r\n\r\n Wishing to testify to you its gratitude for the services you have\r\n already rendered to the Red Cross, the committee decided to offer to\r\n you one of the medals which a German engraver caused to be struck off\r\n in 1870 in honor of the Red Cross. It will be sent to you in a few\r\n days. It is of very small intrinsic value indeed, but such as it is,\r\n we have no other means of recompensing the most meritorious of our\r\n assistants. Please to regard it only as a simple memorial, and as a\r\n proof of the esteem and gratitude we feel for you.\r\n\r\n Accept, Mademoiselle, the assurance of my most distinguished\r\n sentiments,\r\n\r\n  G. MOYNIER\r\n\r\n  President\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of July, 1882, the following proclamation was issued by the\r\nPresident:\r\n\r\n _By the President of the United States of America_:\r\n\r\n A PROCLAMATION\r\n\r\n Whereas, on the 22d day of August, 1864, a convention was concluded\r\n at Geneva, in Switzerland, between the Grand Duchy of Baden and the\r\n Swiss Confederation, the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of Denmark,\r\n the Kingdom of Spain, the French Empire, the Grand Duchy of Hesse,\r\n the Kingdom of Italy, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Kingdom of\r\n Portugal, the Kingdom of Prussia, and the Kingdom of Würtemberg, for\r\n the amelioration of the wounded in armies in the field, the tenor of\r\n which convention is hereinafter subjoined;\r\n\r\n And whereas the several contracting parties to the said Convention\r\n exchanged the ratifications thereof at Geneva on the 22d day of June,\r\n 1865;\r\n\r\n And whereas the several states hereinafter named have adhered to the\r\n said Convention in virtue of Article IX thereof to wit:\r\n\r\n  Sweden                December 13, 1864.\r\n  Greece                January 5-17, 1865.\r\n  Great Britain         February 18, 1865.\r\n  Mecklenburg-Schwerin  March 9, 1865.\r\n  Turkey                July 5, 1865.\r\n  Würtemberg            June 2, 1866.\r\n  Hesse                 June 22, 1866.\r\n  Bavaria               June 30, 1866.\r\n  Austria               July 21, 1866.\r\n  Persia                December 5, 1874.\r\n  Salvador              December 30, 1874.\r\n  Montenegro            November 17-29, 1875.\r\n  Servia                March 24, 1876.\r\n  Bolivia               October 16, 1879.\r\n  Chili                 November 15, 1879.\r\n  Argentine Republic    November 25, 1879.\r\n  Peru                  April 22, 1880.\r\n\r\n And whereas the Swiss Confederation, in virtue of the said Article IX\r\n of said Convention, has invited the United States of America to accede\r\n thereto;\r\n\r\n And whereas on the 20th October, 1868, the following additional\r\n articles were proposed and signed at Geneva, on behalf of Great\r\n Britain, Austria, Baden, Bavaria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy,\r\n Netherlands, North Germany, Sweden and Norway, Switzerland, Turkey,\r\n and Würtemberg, the tenor of which additional articles is hereinafter\r\n subjoined;\r\n\r\n And whereas the President of the United States of America, by and with\r\n the advice and consent of the Senate, did, on the first day of March,\r\n one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two, declare that the United\r\n States accede to the said Convention of the 22d of August, 1864, and\r\n also accede to the said Convention of October 20, 1868;\r\n\r\n And whereas, on the ninth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and\r\n eighty-two, the Federal Council of the Swiss Confederation, in virtue\r\n of the final provision of a certain minute of the exchange of the\r\n ratifications of the said Convention at Berne, December 22, 1864, did,\r\n by a formal declaration, accept the said adhesion of the United States\r\n of America, as well in the name of the Swiss Confederation as in that\r\n of the other contracting states;\r\n\r\n And whereas, furthermore, the Government of the Swiss Confederation\r\n has informed the Government of the United States that the exchange\r\n of the ratifications of the aforesaid additional articles of the 22d\r\n October, 1868, to which the United States of America have, in like\r\n manner, adhered as aforesaid, has not yet taken place between the\r\n contracting parties, and that these articles cannot be regarded as a\r\n treaty in full force and effect:\r\n\r\n Now, therefore, be it known that I, Chester A. Arthur, President of\r\n the United States of America, have caused the said Convention of\r\n August 22, 1864, to be made public, to the end that the same and\r\n every article and clause thereof may be observed and fulfilled with\r\n good faith by the United States and the citizens thereof; reserving,\r\n however, the promulgation of the hereinbefore mentioned additional\r\n articles of October 20, 1868, notwithstanding the accession of\r\n the United States of America thereto, until the exchange of the\r\n ratifications thereof between the several contracting states shall\r\n have been effected, and the said additional articles shall have\r\n acquired full force and effect as an international treaty.\r\n\r\n In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of\r\n the United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n Done at the city of Washington, this twenty-sixth day of July, in the\r\n year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two, and of the\r\n Independence of the United States the one hundred and seventh.\r\n\r\n  [L.S.]\r\n\r\n  CHESTER A. ARTHUR\r\n\r\n  By the President:\r\n\r\n  FRED’K T. FRELINGHUYSEN\r\n  _Secretary of State_\r\n\r\n United States of America, Department of State, to all to whom these\r\n presents shall come, greeting:\r\n\r\n I certify that the foregoing is a true copy of the original on file in\r\n the Department of State.\r\n\r\n In testimony whereof I, John Davis, Acting Secretary of State of the\r\n United States, have hereunto subscribed my name and caused the seal of\r\n the Department of State to be affixed.\r\n\r\n Done at the city of Washington, this 9th day of August, a.d. 1882, and\r\n of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred\r\n and seventh.\r\n\r\n  [L.S.]\r\n\r\n  JOHN DAVIS\r\n\r\n\r\nThus was the American Association of the Red Cross welcomed into the\r\nfellowship of kindred associations in thirty-one other nations, the\r\nmost prosperous and civilized on the globe, its position assured, and\r\nits future course made simple, direct, and untroubled.\r\n\r\nThe Official Bulletin of the International Committee also hailed\r\nthe accession of the United States to the treaty in an article of\r\ncharacteristic caution, and of great significance. In that article the\r\ndistinction was carefully pointed out between that which had already\r\nbeen fully agreed to, and had become invested with all the force and\r\nsolemnity of international treaties, and the proposed treaty, which\r\nhad been drawn up and considered with a view to ultimate adoption.\r\nThis proposed treaty had received the sanction and signature of the\r\nInternational Committee at Geneva without ever having been formally\r\nadopted by any nation. The United States had, at the same moment,\r\nadopted both, thus becoming the thirty-second nation to adhere to the\r\ntreaty of August 22, 1864, and the _first_ to adopt that of October 20,\r\n1868.[3] We quote the entire article:\r\n\r\n\r\n ÉTATS-UNIS\r\n\r\n ADHÉSION DES ÉTATS-UNIS A LA CONVENTION DE GENÈVE\r\n\r\n Nous référant à l’article inséré dans notre précédent Bulletin, nous\r\n sommes heureux de pouvoir annoncer que l’acte d’adhésion, que nous\r\n pressentions, a été signé à Washington le 16 mars, à la suite d’un\r\n vote par lequel les membres du Sénat l’ont approuvé à l’unanimité. Nos\r\n lecteurs seront sans doute surpris, comme nous, qu’après la longue\r\n et systématique résistance du gouvernement des États-Unis pour se\r\n rallier à la Convention de Genève, il ne se soit pas trouvé dans la\r\n législature américaine, lorsque la question a été portée devant elle,\r\n un seul représentant de l’opposition. Un revirement d’opinion aussi\r\n complet ne peut s’expliquer, que si l’on admet que les chefs de la\r\n nation avaient nourri jusqu’à présent des préjugés à l’égard de la\r\n Convention de Genève, préjugés qui se sont évanouis le jour où ils ont\r\n bien compris ce que l’on attendait d’eux, et reconnu qu’il n’y avait\r\n là rien de compremettant pour la politique de leur pays.\r\n\r\n Dans leur zèle de néophytes, ils ont même dépassé le but, car ils ont\r\n voté leur adhésion, non-seulement à la convention du 22 août 1864,\r\n mais encore au _projet_ d’articles additionnels du 20 octobre 1868,\r\n qui n’était pas en cause puisqu’il n’a jamais eu force de loi. Nous ne\r\n donnons du moins cette nouvelle que sous toute réserve, car nous avons\r\n reçu à son sujet des renseignements contradictoires. Si ce vice de\r\n forme se trouve dans la pièce officielle qui sera envoyée au Conseil\r\n Fédéral Suisse, on peut craindre qu’il ne retarde la conclusion tant\r\n désirée de cette importante affaire, mais il ne faudra pas trop le\r\n regretter, puisqu’il aura permis de connaître l’opinion de la grande\r\n république transatlantique, sur les questions maritimes relatives à la\r\n Croix rouge.\r\n\r\n[Translation]\r\n\r\n UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL BULLETIN FOR APRIL--\r\n\r\n No. 50, p. 92\r\n\r\n ADHESION OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE CONVENTION OF GENEVA\r\n\r\n Referring to the article inserted in our preceding Bulletin, p. 42,\r\n we are happy to be able to announce that the act of adhesion which we\r\n presented was signed at Washington the 16th of March, in pursuance of\r\n a vote by which the members of the Senate gave their approval with\r\n unanimity. Our readers will doubtless be surprised, as we are, that\r\n after the long and systematic resistance of the Government of the\r\n United States against rallying to the Convention of Geneva, there\r\n cannot be found in the American legislature a single representative of\r\n the opposition. So complete a reversal of opinion cannot be explained,\r\n unless we admit that the chief officers of the nation had cherished,\r\n up to the present time, prejudices in regard to the Convention of\r\n Geneva--prejudices which vanished as soon as they fully comprehended\r\n what was expected of them, and recognized that there was nothing\r\n compromising in it to the political condition of their country.\r\n\r\n With the zeal of new converts, they have even gone beyond the mark,\r\n inasmuch as they have voted their adhesion not only to the convention\r\n of the 22d of August, 1864, but also to the plan of Additional\r\n Articles of the 20th of October, 1868, which was not the matter in\r\n question, since that had never had the force of law; we give this\r\n news only under every reserve, because we have received contradictory\r\n information on the subject. If this defect in form is found in the\r\n official document which will be sent to the Swiss Federal Council one\r\n could fear it might retard the so much desired conclusion of this\r\n important affair, but it need not be too much regretted, since it\r\n will enable us to understand the opinion of the great Transatlantic\r\n Republic upon maritime questions as they relate to the Red Cross.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the final vote of the Senate, approving the treaty,\r\nfound Clara Barton too weary and too ill to feel at the moment any\r\nthrill of joy in her success. The strength of will that held her to the\r\nend of these struggles was not born of sustained enthusiasm; it was the\r\ntenacity of a courage that had grown very weary, but that never gave\r\nup. It was not the joy of success that called her back to interest in\r\nlife, but the stern call of duty. While the Senate was considering the\r\ntreaty, the Mississippi River was rising higher and higher. That was\r\nher call back to life and labor.\r\n\r\nThe work done in Michigan had served widely to advertise the Red Cross,\r\nand it made way for a wider appeal. The first funds distributed by it\r\nwere collected locally, in the two cities nearest to the summer home of\r\nMiss Barton.\r\n\r\nThe disastrous Mississippi flood occurred in the spring of 1882. Clara\r\nBarton at once called together her advisers and laid her plans for\r\nrelief. It seemed to them wise that public appeal should be delayed\r\nuntil the Senate, then considering the treaty, should have taken\r\nfavorable action; lest precipitate effort for temporary relief might\r\nprejudice the success of the greater end that now was almost in sight.\r\nBut the preparations for relief were made, even though the public\r\nappeal was, for good reason, a little delayed. Indeed, before there was\r\nany official recognition, the Red Cross had its agents on the ground,\r\neffecting local organizations that became permanent. Of this Clara\r\nBarton wrote:\r\n\r\n Again our infant organization sent its field agent, Dr. Hubbell, to\r\n the scene of disaster, where millions of acres of the richest valley,\r\n cotton, and sugar lands of America, and thousands upon thousands of\r\n homes were under the waters of the mightiest of rivers--where the\r\n swift rising floods overtook alike man and beast in their flight\r\n of terror, sweeping them ruthlessly to the gulf beyond, or leaving\r\n them clinging in famishing despair to some trembling roof or swaying\r\n tree-top till relief could reach and rescue them.\r\n\r\n The National Association, with no general fund, sent of its personal\r\n resources what it was able to do, and so acceptable did these prove\r\n and so convincing were the beneficences of the work that the cities of\r\n Memphis, Vicksburg, and New Orleans desired to be permitted to form\r\n associate societies and work under the National Association. This was\r\n permitted, and those societies have remained until the present time,\r\n New Orleans organizing for the entire State of Louisiana. The city of\r\n Rochester, proud and grateful of its success in the disaster a few\r\n months before, again came to the front and again rendered excellent\r\n service.\r\n\r\nA few days were required to complete the official recognition. Then the\r\nAmerican Red Cross issued its first national appeal to the American\r\npeople, a copy of which appeal is still preserved:\r\n\r\n APPEAL TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\r\n\r\n The President having signed the Treaty of the Geneva Conference, and\r\n the Senate having, on the 16th instant, ratified the President’s\r\n action, the American Association of the Red Cross, organized under\r\n provisions of said treaty, purposes to send its agents at once among\r\n the sufferers by the recent floods, with a view to the ameliorating of\r\n their condition so far as can be done by human aid and the means at\r\n hand will permit.\r\n\r\n Contributions are urgently solicited. Remittances in money may be\r\n made to Hon. Charles J. Folger, Secretary of the Treasury, chairman\r\n of the board of trustees, or to his associates, Hon. Robert T.\r\n Lincoln, Secretary of War, and Hon. George B. Loring, Commissioner of\r\n Agriculture. Contributions of wearing apparel, bedding, and provisions\r\n should be addressed to “The Red Cross Agent,” at Memphis, Tenn.,\r\n Vicksburg, Miss., and Helena, Ark.\r\n\r\n  CLARA BARTON\r\n  J. C.

The Red Cross immediately\r\neffected its permanent organization; and during the next twenty years\r\nit was seldom without a task of some kind.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] This is not precisely the name which this rival organization\r\nassumed. There would appear to be no good reason for recording it;\r\nbut the fact that there were several such organizations which sprang\r\ninto being immediately after President Garfield’s recognition of Clara\r\nBarton should not be forgotten.\r\n\r\n[3] Of this proposed treaty of October 20, 1868, the 9th article was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nART. IX. The military hospital ships remain under martial law in all\r\nthat concerns their stores; they become the property of the captor, but\r\nthe latter must not divert them from their special appropriation during\r\nthe continuance of the war.\r\n\r\n[_The vessels not equipped for fighting, which, during peace, the\r\nGovernment shall have officially declared to be intended to serve as\r\nfloating hospital ships, shall, however, enjoy during the war complete\r\nneutrality, both as regards stores, and also as regards their staff,\r\nprovided their equipment is exclusively appropriated to the special\r\nservice on which they are employed._]\r\n\r\nIn the published English text, from which this version of the\r\nAdditional Articles is taken, the paragraph thus marked in brackets\r\nappears in continuation of Article IX. It is not, however, found in the\r\noriginal French text adopted by the Geneva conference, October 20, 1868.\r\n\r\nBy an instruction sent to the United States minister at Berne, January\r\n20, 1883, the right is reserved to omit this paragraph from the English\r\ntext, and to make any other necessary corrections, if at any time\r\nhereafter the Additional Articles shall be completed by the exchange\r\nof the ratifications hereof between the several signatory and adhering\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nCLARA BARTON AT SHERBORN\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be well at this point to make plain three points which were not\r\nclearly understood at the outset, and have sometimes been misunderstood\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nThe first is that Clara Barton, in establishing the Red Cross in\r\nAmerica, was not seeking primarily to provide a place for herself. At\r\nthis period she had three homes, and money enough to support herself\r\ncomfortably in any one of them. We have an interesting look into the\r\nDansville home in a letter of her brother David to his daughter, Ida\r\nBarton Riccius. He was ill, and she, not yet recovered from her own\r\nillness, took him in and nursed him back to health. He wrote:\r\n\r\n  DANSVILLE, June 13, 1880\r\n\r\n Clara’s friends met us at the cars and rendered all necessary\r\n assistance. I was very weak and tired.\r\n\r\n Clara lives in a very splendid old mansion, in a location unsurpassed,\r\n and a grand view of all the surroundings. Her house is filled with\r\n almost everything that adds to health, comfort, and happiness. Clara\r\n is very attentive to me. I think it came rather hard on her the first\r\n part of the time. Perhaps she will stand it a little better now that I\r\n am better and can possibly assist her a little. I have been gradually\r\n gaining since I arrived, considering how miserable I was when I came.\r\n\r\n The living here agrees with me exceedingly well. We have plenty of\r\n good fresh milk, fresh graham bread from the bakery, fresh graham meal\r\n to make puddings, butter, cheese, apple-sauce, any kind of canned\r\n fruit we choose, which generally constitutes our breakfast. For dinner\r\n we have meat, fish, beans, potatoes, and things of that kind. For\r\n supper we have bread, butter, tea or coffee, cheese, and fruit of any\r\n kind. This is the way we live and I enjoy it much. Clara has nearly\r\n all sorts of canned fruit in abundance, but what is best of all is\r\n plenty of nice fresh apples which I go into without mercy.\r\n\r\nClara Barton would have smiled a little at her brother’s arrangement of\r\nher menus. She probably would have said that she had a simple breakfast\r\nof graham bread, fresh butter, and fruit; a hearty midday meal of meat\r\nor fish and vegetables; and a light supper of bread, butter, cheese,\r\nand fruit, with abundance of sweet milk and an unlimited supply of good\r\nred apples.\r\n\r\nThis was the kind of home which Clara Barton left when she went to\r\nWashington to plead for the Red Cross. She often longed for it, and\r\nthought of going back there. Yet the purpose which had taken her to\r\nDansville had been accomplished in her restored health. There was no\r\nimportant work for her to do there, or at Oxford. She could have a roof\r\nand red apples in either place, but she wanted to be promoting what had\r\nbecome the great object in life for her. That was what brought her back\r\nto Washington.\r\n\r\nIf, in all the weary months when she was fighting her lonely battles\r\nfor the Red Cross, it ever occurred to her that this organization\r\nwould give to her a life position, or bring to her either money or\r\nother emoluments, there is no hint of it in her diaries. So far as one\r\nmay judge from these intimate self-revelations, her purpose was as\r\ngenuinely altruistic as human nature is capable of becoming.\r\n\r\nNor is there any indication that she supposed that this would bring\r\nher additional honor. She already had more honors of certain desirable\r\nkinds than any other woman in America. Her Civil War record was known\r\nthroughout the Nation. The lecture platform offered her an inviting and\r\nremunerative invitation to return if she cared to take it up. She had\r\nbrought back with her from Europe official decorations such as royalty\r\nneither before nor since has ever bestowed upon an American woman.\r\n\r\nSecretary Blaine inquired about these with interest one day, and a few\r\ndays later she handed three of them to his secretary with the following\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, D.C., Oct. 31, 1881\r\n\r\n  To the Hon. Secretary of State\r\n  Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n  DEAR MR. BLAINE:\r\n\r\n After the words unintentionally dropped at the interview so kindly\r\n granted me on Saturday, it occurs to me that it is perhaps the\r\n suitable thing for me to do, possibly a duty, to explain to you,\r\n as the Head of our foreign relations, my own connection in that\r\n direction. I will with your kind permission take the liberty to pass\r\n in, by the hand of your secretary, the accompanying “Decorations”:\r\n\r\n The “Iron Cross of Merit” issued to me in 1872 by the Emperor and\r\n Empress of Germany on the occasion of the seventy-fifth birthday of\r\n the Emperor.\r\n\r\n The “Gold Cross of Remembrance” presented to me by the Grand Duke and\r\n Grand Duchess of Baden at the close of the Franco-German War.\r\n\r\n The “Red Cross of Geneva,” brought to Strassburg and placed upon my\r\n neck by the Grand Duchess of Baden, near whose court I suppose by\r\n courtesy I in a manner belong, as the winter of 1872 was passed there,\r\n and I left with the faithful promise to return to Europe once in\r\n two years, and pass each alternate winter with her, a promise which\r\n circumstances alone have prevented me from keeping,--the first four\r\n years after my return to America in 1873 were passed as a broken-down\r\n invalid, mainly confined to my room or bed. The four last, since on\r\n my feet, I have been held here by my efforts, and my promise given\r\n repeatedly abroad, to plant the Red Cross on our own soil, and hang\r\n its peaceful humane flag beside our “Stars and Stripes.”\r\n\r\n I am glad, Mr. Secretary, that you have seen it, as you have in\r\n the late celebration, for you will be the better able, it may be,\r\n to comprehend and excuse my persistency. Except for this constant\r\n and exhaustive occupation, I should have passed either of the last\r\n winters at Carlsruhe; but it has been sufficient to consume my entire\r\n time, strength, and spare means, and must continue to do so, until\r\n the treaty is disposed of and the Societies of the Red Cross, so\r\n indispensable to the effectiveness and utility of the treaty, are\r\n understood by the people, and measurably established throughout the\r\n country. To this end, I have at this moment in press a small work of\r\n a hundred or so pages, explaining the entire subject, its origin,\r\n history, and purposes, and of which I have ordered five thousand\r\n copies for gratuitous circulation. They will be ready at the opening\r\n of Congress or before, and I have four thoroughly formed societies,\r\n one NATIONAL in this city, completed and incorporated, one Local in\r\n Dansville, New York, one in the city of Rochester, New York, for the\r\n county of Monroe, and one similarly organized in Syracuse, New York.\r\n Both Rochester and Syracuse are forming local, town societies under\r\n them, and all, in the happy absence of war, are using up their surplus\r\n energies on the burnt fields of Michigan, to which their agents have\r\n already taken thousands of dollars to the hungry, and thousands of\r\n garments to the naked.\r\n\r\n I must beg, Mr. Blaine, that you do not misinterpret my motive in\r\n making this little revelation of foreign recognition. If the incentive\r\n had been mere personal vanity, I should probably have found a way to\r\n make the facts known, short of a decade, but it comes to me now, that\r\n it is perhaps, under the circumstances, a kind of duty that I should\r\n report to you on “Foreign Affairs.”\r\n\r\n Begging your pardon for my too long letter, I remain, Mr. Secretary,\r\n with the most grateful respect,\r\n\r\n  Very truly\r\n\r\n  CLARA BARTON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next thing that should be kept clearly in mind is that she did not\r\nestablish an organization dependent upon Government appropriations. In\r\nthis respect her organization was quite unlike some of those that were\r\nhastily organized to oppose her. At least one of these was organized\r\nwith an eye keenly intent upon one form of then existing Government\r\nservice, with which it might possibly be affiliated, with an inviting\r\nprospect of salaried positions and official appointments. When the\r\nTreaty of Geneva was ratified, and not only the Senate but House of\r\nRepresentatives stood ready to do almost anything for Clara Barton,\r\nmany of her friends in Congress assumed that the next step would be a\r\nrequest for a Congressional appropriation to cover the administrative\r\nexpense of the Red Cross organization. To every such suggestion Clara\r\nBarton returned an emphatic negative. This was her little creed\r\nannounced at the outset, and often reiterated:\r\n\r\n The Red Cross means, not national aid for the needs of the people, but\r\n the people’s aid for the needs of the Nation.\r\n\r\nShe would not accept a salary or permit any friend of hers in Congress\r\nto introduce a bill for her financial advantage.\r\n\r\nHow keenly she felt the importance of establishing the Red Cross upon\r\nthis basis, and how sensitive she was to the opposition which grew\r\nformidable just before the treaty was adopted, is shown in a letter\r\nof hers to her long-time friend Frances Willard, who wrote to ask the\r\nreason why she was not moving faster in her work for the relief of the\r\npeople in the flooded district along the Mississippi:\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, Feby. 11, 1882\r\n\r\n  DEAR FRANCES WILLARD:\r\n\r\n Yes, I did get your letter telling me about the state of things in\r\n Mississippi and that all was lost there. I have no doubt but that it\r\n is the same the country through. It is hard and heavy and bitter; the\r\n shots of malice and detraction fall thick, but I must stand at the\r\n helm and steer my ship safely into port. The _Treaty of Geneva_ must\r\n first be secured. I have but one passage to take it through and that\r\n is lined thick on every side with guns manned by the Society ladies\r\n of the Capital of the Nation. The Red Cross, a little stranger craft\r\n from a foreign land, bearing only the banner of peace and love, and\r\n her messages of world-wide mercy begging shelter and acceptance in our\r\n capacious harbor, has chosen me for her pilot to bring her in. Besides\r\n these guns that open upon her on all sides she runs against the\r\n chains which have so long held her out--fancied Government defenses\r\n of “Non-intervention,” “Self-isolation,” beware of “Entangling\r\n alliances,” “Washington’s Farewell Address,” “Monroe Doctrine,”\r\n apathy, inertia, general ignorance, national conceit, national\r\n distrust, a desire to retain the old-time barbarous privileges of\r\n privateering and piracy which we have hugged as a precious boon\r\n against every humane treaty since we began. All these my little ship\r\n has had to meet and breast and bear down, before this new and personal\r\n attack was opened upon her, so you see I cannot turn aside from my\r\n duties of a true pilot to contest a new foe. I must bring my ship\r\n through the natural dangers and anchor it safely in port, though _it_\r\n and I be riddled with shot. I have thrown over all extra weight, put\r\n on all sail, muzzled my guns, put my poor tired wounded crew to the\r\n pumps, nailed the little flag to the mast; and so you see us without\r\n other word or sign, plunging through the surf, breaking down chain\r\n after chain, through the fire and smoke, making for the shore. Never\r\n a messenger of mercy met a more inhospitable welcome, but the poor\r\n battered pilot has faith in the craft, and faith in God, and at no\r\n distant day, in spite of all, we shall throw out a sturdy old iron\r\n anchor to grapple with the reefs of the coast, and run up a little\r\n pennant beside the cross, “Treaty Ratified.” After this we shall\r\n be freed from our national disgrace, relieved from the charge and\r\n duties of safe conduct for our course, and then if there is call for\r\n arbitration we will be ready.\r\n\r\nThe success of her work along the Mississippi made it evident that she\r\nmust continue the direction of the Red Cross. But that did not by any\r\nmeans convince her that she was to give up everything else and stay in\r\nWashington. She began to look for something else to do, and something\r\nthat would take her far away from the seat of government.\r\n\r\nShe rather coveted than otherwise the opportunity to show without\r\nadvertising the fact that she had other and visible means of support,\r\nand that her work for the Red Cross was not undertaken for lack of\r\nother employment. Moreover, it was expected that its organization would\r\nbe kept simple, and its work done promptly in times of emergency.\r\nThat was why almost immediately after the Red Cross had become an\r\nactual organization, and she had been constituted its official head\r\nby Presidential nomination and international appointment, and all the\r\nopposing organizations had withered and died, she was willing to accept\r\na salaried position in work of another kind.\r\n\r\nAbout this time she had a letter from Governor Butler of Massachusetts.\r\nHe knew her well and had seen much of her work during the Civil War.\r\nOut of a clear sky came his invitation to her.\r\n\r\n  COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n  EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT\r\n\r\n  BOSTON, January 8, 1883\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR MISS BARTON:\r\n\r\n There is a vacancy in the office of Superintendent of the Woman’s\r\n Reformatory Prison of Massachusetts. It wants a woman at once of\r\n executive ability and kind-heartedness, with an honest love of the\r\n work of reformation and care of her living fellow creatures. How would\r\n that suit you? The salary is not very large. It is $1500.00 a year and\r\n house and expenses of living. Please let me hear from you at your\r\n earliest convenience. I am,\r\n\r\n  Very truly yours\r\n  BENJ. F. BUTLER\r\n\r\n  TO MISS CLARA BARTON\r\n  Dansville, New York\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing could have surprised her more than this invitation and it was\r\nfour months before she decided to accept it. Even then she accepted\r\nwith the stipulation that she would need to close her service in time\r\nto attend the International Convention of the Red Cross in Vienna in\r\nthe following year.\r\n\r\nHer acceptance of the position involved the giving of a bond of\r\n$10,000. With her customary independence she declined to ask any one to\r\nsign her bond, but deposited with the State Treasurer of Massachusetts\r\n$10,000 of interest-bearing bonds and became her own guarantor.\r\n\r\nPrison work was something of which Clara Barton knew nothing and she\r\ndid not bring to it any considerable number of theories as to how it\r\nought to be performed. In her first report, rendered at the end of six\r\nmonths, she took pains to give large credit to those who had preceded\r\nher. She disclaimed for herself either knowledge or achievement. A\r\nportion of this report will bear record here:\r\n\r\n With only the little experience of six months, you will readily\r\n concede that it cannot be considered my work; it would be unjust\r\n arrogance in me to assume it. The noble women and men who toiled for\r\n its existence, the faithful, tireless body of commissioners, who have\r\n watched, prayed, and labored unpaid for it, often unthanked since\r\n with its first baby breath it cried aloud. We, the women of the old\r\n Commonwealth, and more than all perhaps the two grand women who have\r\n preceded me in its charge, are entitled to consider Sherborn Prison\r\n their work. The strong brave-hearted woman, Mrs. Atkinson, who first\r\n dared to lay her hand, untried, upon that mass of chaos, and command\r\n order and law, life and reformation, to come out of it, was braver\r\n than a general. The peaceful, skillful, beloved Dr. Mosher who had the\r\n womanly courage to follow her, and strive and labor to shape still\r\n more perfectly the swelling, yeasty mass of human sin and misery till,\r\n like a wounded color-bearer she fell, bravely praying some comrade to\r\n bear them on to victory. These are the people whose work that prison\r\n is, and in their name, and theirs only, let me speak of it a moment\r\n and commend it to your loving interest and tender care.\r\n\r\n Last May I found, as I entered its great halls, 230 women convicts.\r\n It has at present 275 to 280 women convicts, and, with those who so\r\n kindly care for them, make up a family of something over 300. These\r\n convicts I am expected to feed, clothe, work, and govern, they in\r\n turn to be fed, clothed, to work and obey. The most comprehensive\r\n and I believe correct report I could make would be, that we all\r\n faithfully perform what is expected of us. The manner in which it is\r\n accomplished, and the causes which lead to the necessity for such\r\n accomplishment, are, then, the remaining points of importance. The\r\n causes are as various and widespread as the sins and mishaps which\r\n beset erring humanity, but if you asked me what proportion I thought\r\n would be left, after all the temptations of liquor and men were\r\n removed, I should not require a large sheet on which to write it down.\r\n\r\n Sherborn Reformatory is classed as a State’s Prison, and is thus\r\n squared by the same rule of discipline as ordinary State Prisons for\r\n the retention of State criminals.\r\n\r\n And yet it is to be remembered that not a one-fourth part of these\r\n women are guilty of, or convicted of, any real crime, simply\r\n offenses--drunkenness and unseemly appearance upon the streets;\r\n and yet these poor hopeless, misguided, rum-wrecked women and\r\n night-walking girls are sentenced to the same servitude, subjected\r\n to the same code of discipline, and go out with the same brand of\r\n shame upon the brow, nay, far deeper than the clear-headed, cool,\r\n intelligent, calculating men of Concord, where every inmate is\r\n convicted of a crime. The sad conviction settles down upon me every\r\n day that the soul, brains of the crime of the Commonwealth are in\r\n Concord; the wrecks they have made are in Sherborn; and in my dealing\r\n with these women, I cannot lose sight of this fact. They are more\r\n weak than wicked, often more sinned against than sinning. This, to my\r\n mind, invites a parental, maternal system of government, and to this\r\n they are all amenable; even the most obstinate yields to a rule of\r\n kindness, firmly and steadily administered.\r\n\r\nThe records of this period are necessarily meager. Yet there have\r\ncome to the author unsought testimonials of the great work which\r\nClara Barton accomplished while there. While she never criticized her\r\npredecessors, but gave them generous praise, she stood not at all on\r\nany precedent established by them. She changed the atmosphere of the\r\nplace from an institution of punishment to one of instruction and\r\ncharacter-building. One who visited the prison while she was there\r\nhas told the author of Clara Barton’s power over the incorrigible;\r\nhow women that were violent and untamable by the ordinary methods\r\nbecame docile under her direction. As for the younger women who were\r\nnot hardened, and were often more sinned against than sinning, they\r\nidolized her. She established two letter-boxes in the halls, one to\r\nreceive letters addressed to herself. Any one of the three hundred\r\ninmates was at liberty to write to Miss Barton. A number of the letters\r\nwhich she received were preserved by her and have been read by her\r\nbiographer. They were a pathetic group, some of them absurd in their\r\nrequests, and others tragic in their appeal for help. The gratitude\r\nof others was quite beyond the poor power of expression possessed by\r\nthese girls. In many instances these letters were followed by personal\r\nconferences very fruitful of good.\r\n\r\nThe other box was for letters of complaint addressed to the Board of\r\nManagers. Any inmate was at liberty to write a letter and place it\r\nthere, assured that it would go direct, and that neither Miss Barton\r\nnor any of her assistants would read it. The first box was in constant\r\nuse, the second scarcely ever contained a letter.\r\n\r\nThis was work for which Clara Barton had no natural liking. It was very\r\nfar from the type of work she would have chosen. She never supposed\r\nit to be a permanent position. She accepted it because she felt that\r\nher health was sufficiently assured to justify her in undertaking some\r\ndefinite responsibility, and this was a place where she could go for a\r\nlimited time and from it honorably retire. She was glad of a definite\r\nposition in some other work than the Red Cross, yet one which did\r\nnot compel her to resign her responsibilities in that organization.\r\nShe found time while at Sherborn to attend a national gathering of\r\nphilanthropic organizations in Denver, and deliver an address on\r\nthe Red Cross. And she continued general oversight of its affairs.\r\nShe retired from the work with no desire ever to see the inside of\r\nanother prison; but also with a deepened interest in all work of that\r\ncharacter, and with increased faith that in such work, as everywhere,\r\nkindness and an appeal to honor and self-respect were more effective\r\nthan punishments which degrade and destroy hope.\r\n\r\nShe continued her work at Sherborn a little longer than she intended,\r\nbecause the term of Governor Butler was drawing to a close, and he did\r\nnot wish to make a temporary appointment. She withdrew at the close of\r\nhis term, and the day of her departure was a day of mourning in the\r\nprison at Sherborn.\r\n\r\nA few months afterward an international conference was held at\r\nSaratoga and she was invited to deliver an address on prison reform.\r\nThe notes of that address are preserved:\r\n\r\n Some steps in life are accounted unwise, some foolish, some foolhardy.\r\n Until the present hour perhaps the most foolhardy step I have ever\r\n been led to take was the temporary superintendence of a State Prison\r\n for the management, control, and reformation of women.\r\n\r\n Though consenting, however unwillingly, to undertake a work of which I\r\n knew nothing, and under _such_ circumstances, I did undertake it. But,\r\n good, kind, and loving friends, in point of temerity and foolhardiness\r\n the effort of this present hour beggars that. That I, with literally\r\n no experience, no knowledge of the subject, with thoughts running\r\n always in other channels,--should in any way, however tacitly, have\r\n given consent to take my place at this desk this evening beside these\r\n gentlemen who embody in themselves the experimental knowledge of the\r\n world upon this subject, and before this audience, trained to thought,\r\n the cultivated cream of the land, is to me past human comprehension.\r\n The Lord directs--let us obey.\r\n\r\n In May, 1883, after four months of combined importunity from the\r\n then Governor, General Butler, and all the people interested in and\r\n controlling the penal institutions of the State of Massachusetts, that\r\n I take the superintendency of Sherborn Reformatory Prison (and it was,\r\n I believe, the only point upon which the Governor and the people ever\r\n did agree), I decided to take it for six months. I remained something\r\n longer.\r\n\r\n I entered that prison feeling myself so ignorant of all that pertained\r\n to its line of work and methods and thought, that it seemed to me\r\n positively _wicked_, to waste my own time and that of the community\r\n and those who must come under me, in the strengthless, thoughtless\r\n vacancy of my attempted work--I seemed to myself a kind of empty\r\n balloon.\r\n\r\n At the end of eight months I went out of it, with a burden of\r\n thoughts, plans, ways and means, possible and impossible, under which\r\n my body could scarcely hold itself erect or my feet carry me away.\r\n\r\n I seemed more to myself like an already heavy-ladened ship, which had\r\n met another in distress and taken on shipwrecked passengers and crew,\r\n till her gunwales hugged the water and her laboring wheels wearily\r\n tugged for the land.\r\n\r\n So piled, so criss-crossed, so intricate, so vast, contradictory,\r\n perplexing, so vexed by customs, so hampered by foolish laws, so bound\r\n by mercenary ends, so fettered by political ambitions, aspirations,\r\n asperities and jealousies, to say nothing of the immutable laws of\r\n natural descent as related to crime--so discouraging was all this to\r\n be faced from the latter half of a busy life that I wearily and gladly\r\n turned and laid the burden down on the hands of you skilled laborers,\r\n and have mainly been content to feel and leave it there.\r\n\r\n The subject of prison reform seems to me to be so vast, and the\r\n methods by which it is to be attempted so varied, that it can scarcely\r\n be touched in one talk.\r\n\r\n The first question might be, What is meant by prison reform? and in\r\n what degree? Palliation or cure? I well remember the one question\r\n which always confronted me from visitors at Sherborn--“Miss Barton,\r\n how is it, do you really reform any one here?” My reply was,\r\n “That depends upon what _you_ consider reform to consist in. If\r\n you mean to ask if we take women here, badly born, worse raised,\r\n with inherited, habitual, vagrant crime in their natures, with the\r\n grogshop and the brothel for their teachers, who never lived a decent\r\n day or knew a decent night, filthy inside and out, and that by a\r\n residence of a few months here we are able to send them out to you\r\n not only good, well-behaved, industrious, cleanly, sober, orderly,\r\n honest, respectable members of society,--something they never were\r\n before,--infallible, proof against all the temptations and vices\r\n which you of the free community on the outside may throw in their\r\n path, so they shall never fall again; then, No, we reform no one,\r\n and our prison is a failure; but, if reform may mean that the habits\r\n which must incidentally grow up in the minds, characters, and tastes\r\n of these women during a term of two years of sober, industrious,\r\n and instructed life, in which they shall see only cleanliness and\r\n order, where the workroom shall replace the street, the quiet cell,\r\n the school-room, and the chapel in the place of the grogshop and the\r\n brothel, kindly spoken words of advice, prayer, praise, and song in\r\n the place of oaths and vulgarity, and a _resolution_ at least to try\r\n to lead a better life,--if all this may be accounted in the direction\r\n of reform, then, Yes, a thousand times Yes, we reform all that come\r\n within our reach.”\r\n\r\n The prison in itself is all well, but the danger lies beyond in the\r\n temptations, the lures, and the traps of the community into which\r\n this poor, weak creature is plunged in her first hour of regained\r\n liberty. I never saw one of these women go out with her little bundle\r\n of freedom suit, and watched the eager yet timid and half-frightened\r\n look on her face, and felt the childlike, clinging grasp upon mine,\r\n and heard the universal “Good-bye, don’t forget me,” that through the\r\n tears a great prayer did not rise up in my heart, “O God, strengthen\r\n her weakness--guard her from the temptations and the snares leading\r\n her down to death, of Thy virtuous and free, outside these prison\r\n walls.”\r\n\r\n I recall once an official visit from about twenty members of the State\r\n Legislature, at Boston, for the purpose of overlooking the prison\r\n and seeing what it might need and how it could be best officially\r\n served; accordingly they appealed to _me_ for my opinion generally--if\r\n the prison were what it should be in its _appointments_, if it were\r\n _large_ enough or _too_ large, etc., and in a general way what I would\r\n recommend to them to do; as by recent Act they had made me not only\r\n Superintendent but Treasurer and Steward as well. I replied: “This\r\n Prison is all very well--a model prison and certainly as large as it\r\n ought to be for the size of the State; and it is very probable that\r\n there is not very much that you can directly do for it at present, as\r\n an Institution; but, Gentlemen, the Institution from which you come\r\n has the making of the laws by which this Institution exists; any time\r\n when you _there_ will find a way to make it impossible for the people\r\n of this State to get intoxicating liquors, upon which to get drunk, I\r\n will guarantee that in six months the State of Massachusetts may rent\r\n Sherborn for a shoe manufactory.” I am not sure that _they_ believed\r\n what I said, but _I_ did and still do.\r\n\r\n True, crime will exist without drunkenness, but to no such extent\r\n as to require two miles of prison galleries for the women of\r\n Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n In _this_ country I regard drunkenness as the great father of crime,\r\n and the mother of prisons, almshouses, asylums, and workhouses--the\r\n parent of vice and want and the instigator of murder. Whatever bears\r\n ever so little against this is to my mind “Prison Reform.”\r\n\r\n Then follow in their mournful train the sin-bound _cortège_ of primal\r\n and secondary causes of vice and crime and which make necessary the\r\n various methods of treatment which have been so ably discovered that\r\n no words of mine could throw a single ray of added light upon the\r\n subject. I can only _concur_, or perhaps express suggestively some\r\n preferences which may have presented themselves to me.\r\n\r\n In regard to intermediate sentences: I may not be sufficiently clear\r\n upon the technical points as presented by our good brother, but in a\r\n general way I would say I am unequivocally in favor of an unfixed term\r\n of imprisonment when the sentence is given. A fixed time of release is\r\n an independence to the prisoner beyond the power of his keepers and\r\n stands directly in the way of all reform.\r\n\r\n I would earnestly advocate everywhere, in all prisons, police\r\n stations, houses of detention--in short, everywhere, the placing of\r\n arrested women and women prisoners in charge of women only, and men\r\n in charge of men. It is just and right for every reason of virtue and\r\n decency; here again it is largely this contact that has _destroyed_;\r\n it _cannot restore_.\r\n\r\n I would, for every consideration of humanity, have the most careful,\r\n intelligent, and scientific investigation made in all prisons for\r\n any possible tendency to _insanity_ on the part of any prisoner. The\r\n willful subjection to prison rules and penalties of those from whose\r\n benighted souls the light of reason and the power of self-control have\r\n been withdrawn is cruelty inexcusable and accursed in the sight of God\r\n and man.\r\n\r\n In the name of all mercy single these out and take them to their own\r\n place.\r\n\r\n Again, I would in the name of humanity lessen so far as possible the\r\n stimulating qualities of the food generally given out in prisons--more\r\n of grains, vegetables, and fruit, and less of _meat_. The result of\r\n this I am confident would be seen in the better temper, more tractable\r\n natures, lessened irritability, and happier frame of minds on the part\r\n of all convicts. I would have the food plentiful, but unstimulating,\r\n and the cooking wholesome. The records of the punishments in a prison\r\n could not fail in time to demonstrate the beneficial result of this\r\n course.\r\n\r\n Cannot this thought find somewhere and sometime a little consideration\r\n in your deliberations? In the name of humanity I suggest it.\r\n\r\n There remains but one subject more which I would name, and but a word\r\n of that--simply the relations and feeling to be maintained between the\r\n inmates of a prison and those in charge of them. I would recommend not\r\n only a uniform kindness and firmness of course on the part of every\r\n attendant, but a uniform politeness as well. Like begets like in spite\r\n of everything. It increases self-respect. This they have lost, and\r\n this they need to have restored so far as may be. Make punishment as\r\n rare as possible, but _sure_, and in all instances as light as the\r\n case will admit of. I regard undue severity of punishment as far more\r\n harmful than no correction at all. Cultivate the love of the convicts\r\n by all proper means; it is more potent than punishment.\r\n\r\n I believe the record of my last month at Sherborn shows not a single\r\n punishment among between three and four hundred women. They grew to\r\n feel that the only hurt of their punishment was the pain it gave me.\r\n When I met them for the last night in the chapel, and told them we\r\n should not meet again, and invited each to come and bid me good-bye,\r\n the sobs and wails that went out, and the tears that went over my\r\n hands as I held theirs for the last time, were harder for me than all\r\n the eight months’ work I had done among them. As I passed down the\r\n long corridors in the dark, unheard by them, at ten o’clock, and the\r\n low moans and sobs were still going out, it was too much to bear. I\r\n sought my own room--sank down, cold and shivering with the terrible\r\n thought that rushed over me--Had it not been all wrong? Was I far\r\n enough removed from them? Surely we must be too near alike, if not\r\n akin, or they would never have clung to me with that pitiful love.\r\n\r\n I went out from the prison walls of Sherborn next morning. I have\r\n never seen a face there since. I have never returned and I have no\r\n desire to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE RED CROSS IN PEACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Red Cross as organized in Europe, and as Clara Barton learned of\r\nit there, had no ministry except in times of war. It was one of the\r\ndistinctive features of Clara Barton’s plan that the American Red\r\nCross should give service in any time of national, or possibly of\r\ninternational, calamity. So far as the Red Cross existed by virtue\r\nof an international treaty, its work was to care for the wounded of\r\nthe battle-field; but the American Red Cross, as incorporated in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, and as operated under the direction of Clara\r\nBarton, offered an agency immediately available for the relief of\r\nsuffering wherever the need was greater than could be met by local\r\nbenefactions.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the first service of the American Red\r\nCross was in the autumn of 1881, in the forest fires of Michigan,\r\nalmost a year before the official accession of the United States to\r\nthe Treaty of Geneva. The report which reached Clara Barton and the\r\nNation that half the State of Michigan was on fire, was, of course,\r\nan exaggeration, and she was not deceived by it, but she knew that\r\nthe need was greater than could be met by local philanthropy. Already\r\nthere had been organized a single unit of the Red Cross, at Dansville,\r\nNew York. Clara Barton flung out the Red Cross flag in front of her\r\nhome, and called her organization into activity. The two neighboring\r\ncities of Rochester and Syracuse came immediately to her assistance.\r\nContributions which aggregated three thousand dollars were placed\r\nimmediately at her disposal. Miss Barton’s home became a center of\r\nactivity, a dépôt for the packing and shipping of supplies. The second\r\nauxiliary of the Red Cross in the United States was organized at\r\nRochester, with a membership of two hundred and fifty; that at Syracuse\r\nfollowed immediately. The total amount received and distributed by the\r\nRed Cross in money and material amounted to eighty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThe Michigan fires brought to Miss Barton’s assistance Dr. Julian\r\nB. Hubbell. She had known him in Dansville as an instructor in the\r\nSeminary which was located there. She knew him as a man to be relied\r\nupon. When the forest fires occurred, Dr. Hubbell was a medical student\r\nin the University of Michigan. She wired him at once to proceed to\r\nthe scene of the fire and give her accurate information. Dr. Hubbell\r\nreported that hundreds of people had been suffocated and burned to\r\ndeath in the rapid sweep of the flames, and that many thousands were\r\nhomeless and in need of shelter, food, clothing, and medical care.\r\nMiss Barton at once commissioned Dr. Hubbell as field agent of the\r\nRed Cross. This was the beginning of a relationship which was never\r\nbroken until the death of Clara Barton. Dr. Hubbell completed his\r\nmedical course, and was commissioned as general field officer of the\r\nAmerican National Red Cross. This position he occupied from 1881 until\r\nher resignation in 1904. He was with her in every one of the American\r\nfields of service; accompanied her to Turkey at the time of the\r\nArmenian massacres; went with her to Cuba at the time of the Spanish\r\nWar; and was as indispensable to her as her own right hand. After the\r\ntermination of her presidency of the American Red Cross, he remained\r\nnear her, was with her in her last illness, and stood beside her when\r\nshe died. With her nephew Stephen, he accompanied her body to the old\r\nhome in Oxford and wept beside her grave. He was among the friends, and\r\ntheir number was not small, who were faithful to her to the very end of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of the present author to relate in detail the\r\nstory of the work of the Red Cross during the next twenty-three\r\nyears. Clara Barton herself has done that in a large octavo volume of\r\nnearly seven hundred pages. To that book reference must be had for\r\nany adequate idea of her service for almost a quarter of a century.\r\nAlmost every year beheld a calamity of sufficient magnitude to call for\r\nthe official activity of the American Red Cross. The mere list of the\r\nfields of its service is notable:\r\n\r\n  1881, the Michigan forest fires.\r\n  1882, the Mississippi River floods.\r\n  1883, the Mississippi River floods.\r\n  1883, the tornado in Louisiana and Alabama.\r\n  1883, the Balkan War.\r\n  1884, the Ohio and Mississippi River floods.\r\n  1885, the Texas famine.\r\n  1886, the Charleston earthquake.\r\n  1888, the tornado at Mt. Vernon, Illinois.\r\n  1888, the Florida yellow-fever epidemic.\r\n  1889, the Johnstown flood.\r\n  1892, the Russian famine.\r\n  1893, the tornado at Pomeroy, Iowa.\r\n  1893 and 94, the hurricane and tidal wave in the South Carolina\r\n   islands.\r\n  1896, the Armenian massacres in Turkey in Asia Minor.\r\n  1898 to 1900, the Cuban Reconcentrado relief.\r\n  1898, the Spanish-American War.\r\n  1900, the Galveston storm and tidal wave.\r\n  1904, the typhoid fever epidemic at Butler, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIn almost every instance Clara Barton went in person to the field.\r\nWhere she went was order, efficiency, sympathy, and comfort. In the\r\ndays of the Civil War the official sign of a hospital was the yellow\r\nbanner, still used in the quarantine service to designate a hospital\r\nfor the treatment of contagious diseases. It was and is a respectable\r\nand worthy emblem, but there was nothing very inspiring about it.\r\nWhere Clara Barton went on her missions of mercy, two flags floated,\r\nthe Stars and Stripes and the beautiful white flag with its cross of\r\nblazing red.\r\n\r\nClara Barton loved the color red. The red rose was the flower of her\r\nfamily. A dash of red she almost invariably had about her clothing\r\nsomewhere. It was altogether in keeping with her personal tastes that\r\nthe emblem which came to symbolize her life-work was of the color\r\nwhich never failed to gladden her eye. In 1881 she set out, as she\r\nherself related in her first article for the Associated Press, to make\r\nthe name and emblem of the Red Cross as familiar in America, as for\r\nmany years it had been in almost every other civilized nation. She\r\nsucceeded in doing this, not simply by a campaign of publicity, but by\r\nthe practical agency of applied mercy. When fire or famine or flood\r\ndevastated a region, and its victims were homeless and despairing, and\r\nlocal agencies for relief were overworked and working aimlessly or at\r\ncross-purposes, the unfurling of the flag of the Red Cross was the sign\r\nof hope. It meant not only human kindness and sympathy, but confidence\r\nand efficiency and success.\r\n\r\nFrom every one of these twenty fields Clara Barton came back laden down\r\nwith the grateful testimonials of the communities to which she had\r\nbrought comfort and help.\r\n\r\nA very brief outline of her work in these several fields may be\r\nsummarized from her own reports. The work for the Michigan forest\r\nfires has already been referred to, and reference has been made to the\r\nfirst expedition of the Red Cross for the relief of the sufferers from\r\nthe Mississippi floods. A further word should be said concerning the\r\nservice of the Red Cross during the floods, and then a brief summary of\r\nthe work in each of the other fields.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISSISSIPPI AND OHIO RIVER FLOODS--1882-83\r\n\r\n The spring rise of the waters of the Mississippi brought great\r\n devastation, and a cry went over the country in regard to the\r\n sufferings of the inhabitants of the Mississippi Valley. For hundreds\r\n of miles the great river was out of its bed and raging madly over the\r\n country, sweeping in its course not only the homes, but often the\r\n people, the animals, and many times the land itself. This constituted\r\n a work of the relief clearly within the bounds of the civil part\r\n of our treaty, and again we prepared for work. Again our infant\r\n organization sent its field agent, Dr. Hubbell, to the scene of\r\n disaster, where millions of acres of the richest valley, cotton and\r\n sugar lands of America, and thousands upon thousands of homes under\r\n the waters of the mightiest of rivers--where the swift-rising floods\r\n overtook alike man and beast in their flight of terror, sweeping them\r\n ruthlessly to the Gulf beyond, or leaving them clinging in famishing\r\n despair to some trembling roof or swaying tree-top till relief could\r\n reach and rescue them.\r\n\r\n The National Association, with no general fund, sent of its personal\r\n resources what it was able to do, and so acceptable did these prove\r\n and so convincing were the beneficences of the work that the cities of\r\n Memphis, Vicksburg, and New Orleans desired to be permitted to form\r\n associate societies and work under the National Association. This was\r\n permitted, and those societies have remained until the present time,\r\n New Orleans organizing for the entire State of Louisiana. The city\r\n of Rochester, proud and grateful of its success in the disaster a few\r\n months before, again came to the front and again rendered excellent\r\n service.\r\n\r\n In the spring of 1883 occurred the first great rise of the Ohio River;\r\n one thousand miles in extent. This river, although smaller than the\r\n Mississippi, is more rapid in its course, and its valleys hold the\r\n richest grain lands, the most cultivated farms, representing, in fact,\r\n the best farming interests of America.\r\n\r\n The destruction of property was even greater here than in the\r\n cotton and cane lands of the Mississippi. Again our field agent was\r\n dispatched and did excellent work. The entire country was aroused, and\r\n so liberal were the contributions to the various committees of relief\r\n that when Dr. Hubbell retired from the field, having completed the\r\n work, he had still unexpended funds in hand. But they were soon needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOUISIANA AND MISSISSIPPI TORNADO OF 1883\r\n\r\n In less than a month occurred the fearful tornado of Louisiana and\r\n Mississippi, which cut a swath clear of all standing objects for\r\n thirty miles in width and several hundred miles in length, running\r\n southeast from the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\n Our special agent for the South, Colonel F. R. Southmayd, took charge\r\n of the Red Cross relief in this disaster, and so efficient was his\r\n work that societies struggled for organization under him and the Red\r\n Cross was hailed as a benediction wherever he passed. This was in May,\r\n 1883.\r\n\r\n Our association now enjoyed for eight months a respite from active\r\n work. It was surely needed. It was the longest rest we had yet known,\r\n and afforded some small opportunity to gather up its records of\r\n past labors, organize some societies, and compile a history of the\r\n Red Cross, so much needed for the information of our people and so\r\n earnestly asked for by them as well as by the United States Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OHIO RIVER FLOODS OF 1884\r\n\r\n The rapidly melting snows of February, 1884, brought the thousand\r\n miles of the Ohio River again out of its bed. A cry went out all\r\n over the country for help. The Government, through Congress, took\r\n immediate action and appropriated several hundred thousand dollars for\r\n relief, to be applied through the War Department. The Red Cross agents\r\n must again repair to the field, its societies be again notified.\r\n\r\n But its president felt that, if she were to be called every year\r\n to direct the relief work of the association in these inundations,\r\n it was incumbent upon her to visit the scene in person, to see for\r\n herself what floods were like, to learn the necessities and be able to\r\n direct with the wisdom born of actual knowledge of the subject; and\r\n accordingly, with ten hours’ preparation, she joined Dr. Hubbell on\r\n his way and proceeded to Pittsburgh, the head of the Ohio River. There\r\n the societies were telegraphed that Cincinnati would be headquarters\r\n and that money and supplies should be sent there. This done, we\r\n proceeded to Cincinnati by rail.\r\n\r\n Any description of this city upon our entrance would fall so far short\r\n of the reality as to render it useless.\r\n\r\n The surging river had climbed up the bluffs like a devouring monster\r\n and possessed the town; large steamers could have plied along its\r\n business streets; ordinary vocations were abandoned. Bankers and\r\n merchants stood in its relief houses and fed the hungry populace,\r\n and men and women were out in boats passing baskets of food to pale,\r\n trembling hands stretched out to reach it from third-story windows of\r\n the stately blocks and warehouses of that beautiful city. Sometimes\r\n the water soaked away the foundations and the structure fell with\r\n a crash and was lost in the floods below; in one instance seven\r\n lives went out with the falling building; and this was one city, and\r\n probably the best protected and provided locality in a thousand miles\r\n of thickly populated country.\r\n\r\n It had not been my intention to remain at the scene of disaster,\r\n but rather to see, investigate, establish an agency, and return to\r\n national headquarters at Washington, which in the haste of departure\r\n had been left imperfectly cared for. But I might almost say, in\r\n military parlance, that I was “surprised and captured.”\r\n\r\n I had made no call beyond the Red Cross societies,--expected no\r\n supplies from other sources,--but scarcely had news of our arrival\r\n at Cincinnati found its way to the public press when telegrams of\r\n money and checks, from all sides and sources, commenced to come in,\r\n with letters announcing the sending of material. The express office\r\n and freight depots began filling up until within two weeks we were\r\n compelled to open large supply rooms, which were generously tendered\r\n to the use of the Red Cross. A description could no more do justice\r\n to our flood of supplies than to the flood of waters which had made\r\n them necessary--cases, barrels and bales of clothing, food, household\r\n supplies, new and old; all that intelligent awakened sympathy could\r\n suggest was there in such profusion that, so far from thinking\r\n of leaving it, one must call all available help for its care and\r\n distribution.\r\n\r\n The Government would supply the destitute people with food, tents, and\r\n army blankets, and had placed its military boats upon the river to\r\n rescue the people and issue rations until the first great need should\r\n be supplied.\r\n\r\n The work of the Red Cross is supplemental and it sought for the\r\n special wants likely to be overlooked in this great general supply and\r\n the necessities _outside_ the limits of governmental aid. The search\r\n was not difficult. The Government provided neither fuel nor clothing.\r\n It was but little past midwinter. A cyclone struck the lower half of\r\n the river with the water at its greatest height and whole villages\r\n were swept away in a night. The inhabitants escaped in boats, naked\r\n and homeless. Hail fell to the depth of several inches and the entire\r\n country was encased in sleet and ice. The water had filled the coal\r\n mines, so abundant in that vicinity, until no fuel could be obtained.\r\n The people were more likely to freeze than starve, and against this\r\n there was no provision.\r\n\r\n We quickly removed our headquarters from Cincinnati to Evansville,\r\n three hundred miles below and at the head of the recent scene of\r\n disaster. A new stanch steamer of four hundred tons’ burden was\r\n immediately chartered and laden to the water’s edge with clothing and\r\n coal; good assistants, both men and women, were taken on board; the\r\n Red Cross flag was hoisted and, as night was setting in, after a day\r\n of intense cold--amid surging waters and crashing ice, the floating\r\n wrecks of towns and villages, great uprooted giants of the forest\r\n plunging madly to the sea, the suddenly unhoused people wandering\r\n about the river-banks, or huddled in strange houses with fireless\r\n hearths--the clear-toned bell and shrill whistle of the _Josh V.\r\n Throop_ announced to the generous inhabitants of a noble city that\r\n from the wharves of Evansville was putting out the first Red Cross\r\n relief boat that ever floated on American waters.\r\n\r\n The destroyed villages and hamlets lay thick on either bank, and the\r\n steamer wove its course diagonally from side to side calling the\r\n people to the boat, finding a committee to receive and distribute,\r\n and, learning as nearly as possible the number of destitute persons,\r\n put off the requisite quantity of clothing and coal, and steamed away\r\n quickly and quietly, leaving sometimes an astonished _few_, sometimes\r\n a _multitude_ to gaze after and wonder who she was, whence she came,\r\n what that strange flag meant, and, most of all, to thank God with\r\n tears and prayers for what she brought.\r\n\r\n In this manner the Red Cross proceeded to Cairo, a distance of four\r\n hundred miles, where the Ohio joins the Mississippi River, which\r\n latter at that time had not risen and was exciting no apprehension.\r\n Returning, we revisited and resupplied the destitute points. The\r\n Government boats running over the same track were genial and friendly\r\n with us, and faithful and efficient in their work.\r\n\r\n It should be said that, notwithstanding all the material we had\r\n shipped and distributed, so abundant had been the liberality of the\r\n people that, on our return to Evansville, we found our supply greater\r\n than at any previous time.\r\n\r\n At this moment, and most unexpectedly, commenced the great rise of\r\n the Mississippi River, and a _second_ cry went out to the Government\r\n and the people for instant help. The strongest levees were giving way\r\n under the sudden pressure, and even the inundation of the city of New\r\n Orleans was threatened. Again the Government appropriated money, and\r\n the War Department sent out its rescue and ration boats, and again the\r\n Red Cross prepared for its supplemental work.\r\n\r\n In an overflow of the Mississippi, owing to the level face of the\r\n country and the immense body of water, the valley is inundated at\r\n times thirty miles in width, thus rendering it impossible to get\r\n animals to a place of safety. Great numbers drown and the remainder,\r\n in a prolonged overflow, have largely starved, the Government having\r\n never included the domestic animals in its work of relief. This seemed\r\n an omission of vital importance, both humanely and economically\r\n considered, and the Red Cross prepared to go to the relief of the\r\n starving animals of the Mississippi Valley. It would also supply\r\n clothing to the destitute people whom the Government would feed.\r\n\r\n The navigation of the Mississippi River calls for its own style of\r\n boats and pilotage, the latter being both difficult and dangerous,\r\n especially with the changed channels and yawning crevasses of a flood.\r\n\r\n The steamer _Throop_ was left at Evansville and the _Mattie Bell_\r\n chartered at St. Louis and laden with corn, oats, hay, meal, and salt\r\n for cattle; clothing and cooking utensils for the destitute people;\r\n tea, coffee, rice, sugar, and medicines for the sick; and as quickly\r\n as possible followed the Government steamers leaving the same port\r\n with rations of meat and meal.\r\n\r\n We finished the voyage of relief, having covered the Ohio River from\r\n Cincinnati to Cairo and back twice, and the Mississippi from St.\r\n Louis to New Orleans and return, occupying four months’ time on the\r\n rivers, in our own chartered boats, finishing at Pittsburgh and taking\r\n rail for Washington on the first of July, having traveled over eight\r\n thousand miles, and distributed in relief, of money and estimated\r\n material, $175,000.\r\n\r\n The Government had expended an appropriation from the Treasury on\r\n the same waters of $150,000 in money, and distributed it well. The\r\n difference was that ours was not appropriated; we gathered it as we\r\n used it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEXAS FAMINE OF 1885-86\r\n\r\n Occasional rumors reached us in the years 1885 and 1886 about a drouth\r\n in Texas and consequent suffering, but they were so contradictory and\r\n widely at variance that the public took little or no heed of them.\r\n During the year of 1886 the Reverend John Brown, a North Presbyterian\r\n minister, located at Albany, Shackelford County, Texas, began making\r\n appeals by circular and oral address to the people of the Northern\r\n States, in which he asserted that there were a hundred thousand\r\n families in northwestern Texas who were utterly destitute and on the\r\n verge of starvation. He stated that since the close of the war a large\r\n number of poor families had been constantly crowding into Texas from\r\n the Southern States principally, induced thither by land agents and\r\n others, who gave glowing representations of the character of the soil\r\n for farming purposes.\r\n\r\n These poor people, by hard labor and industry, had been generally able\r\n to make a living and nothing more. The last fall they had planted\r\n wheat and other grain quite extensively, but the rains came not and\r\n everything perished; and in the following spring and summer, too,\r\n everything put into the ground was blasted by the hot winds, so that\r\n not a thing was raised for man or beast. For fifteen months no rain\r\n had fallen, and the condition of the people was pitiable and called\r\n aloud to the charitable throughout the land for relief. They must be\r\n carried through to the next summer or they would perish. At a meeting\r\n of the citizens of Albany, Texas, they decided that the task of\r\n relieving the sufferers was greater than the well-to-do people of the\r\n State were able to undertake, and that an appeal should be made to the\r\n good-hearted people of the North for immediate aid. The Governor of\r\n Texas also published an appeal to the people of the whole land, asking\r\n for food for these people. But as there was no concerned action, and\r\n so many denials of the stories of suffering, little or nothing in the\r\n way of relief work was accomplished for some time. Spasmodic attempts\r\n were made, and some food for man and beast was contributed, but not\r\n enough to relieve a hundredth part of the needy.\r\n\r\n The Reverend Doctor Brown went to the State Capital and endeavored to\r\n interest the Legislature in the matter, but there were seemingly so\r\n much misunderstanding and unbelief, and so many conflicting interests\r\n to reconcile, that he failed to receive any substantial assurances and\r\n left the place in disgust. When the citizens of Texas could not agree\r\n as to the necessities of their own people, it was not to be expected\r\n that the citizens of the country would take much interest in them,\r\n hence the relief movement languished from inanition.\r\n\r\n About the middle of January, 1887, Dr. Brown came to Washington and,\r\n as solicitor and receiving agent for the committee which had issued an\r\n appeal to the country, appealed to me, as president of the American\r\n National Red Cross, asking our organization to come to the relief of\r\n the people, who were in a deplorable state, greatly needing food and\r\n clothing. I immediately shipped to Texas all the stores that were then\r\n in our warehouse, but they were no great quantity.\r\n\r\n An appeal direct to the Red Cross required immediate attention, and I\r\n at once sought a conference with President Cleveland, who was greatly\r\n worried over the contradictory stories that were constantly printed,\r\n and was anxious to learn the truth about the matter. When I said that\r\n I should go to Texas and see for myself, he was greatly pleased, and\r\n requested me to report to him the exact situation just as soon as I\r\n had satisfied myself by personal investigation.\r\n\r\n Dr. Hubbell and I proceeded directly to Albany, Texas, where we\r\n arrived near the end of January. We were met by the leading citizens\r\n and most heartily welcomed and accorded every privilege and attention.\r\n We began our investigations at once in a systematic way, carefully\r\n noting everything we heard and saw; and in the course of a two weeks’\r\n trip over the afflicted region, we learned the extent of the need and\r\n formulated plans for its relief.\r\n\r\n Making Albany our object point, we traveled by private conveyance over\r\n such territory as we thought sufficient to give a correct knowledge of\r\n the condition of the country and the people. We met large numbers of\r\n the residents, both collectively and at their homes, and learned from\r\n them personally and by actual observation their condition and what\r\n they had to depend upon during the next few months. It will be borne\r\n in mind that when we entered upon this investigation little or no\r\n relief had come from the State, and none was positively assured.\r\n\r\n Almost no rain had fallen during a period of eighteen months; two\r\n planted crops had perished in the ground, and the seed wheat sown the\r\n previous fall gave no signs of life. The dust was rolling over the\r\n great wind-swept fields, where the people had hidden their last little\r\n forlorn hope of borrowed seed, and literally a heaven of brass looked\r\n down upon an earth of iron.\r\n\r\n Here were twenty to forty counties, of a size commensurate with Texan\r\n dimensions, occupied by new settlers, making their first efforts in\r\n the pioneer work of developing home life in an untried country, soil,\r\n and climate. They had put their all into the new home and the little\r\n stock they could afford for its use. They had toiled faithfully,\r\n planted two and three times, as long as there was anything to plant\r\n or sow, and in most instances failed to get back their seed. Many had\r\n grown discouraged and left the country. The people were not actually\r\n starving, but they were in the direst want for many of the necessities\r\n of life, and it was only a matter of days when they would have reached\r\n the condition of the _reconcentrados_ as we later found them in Cuba.\r\n Hundreds of thousands of cattle had died for the want of food and\r\n water, and their drying carcasses and bleaching bones could be seen in\r\n every direction as the eye wandered over the parched surface of the\r\n plains.\r\n\r\n I at once saw that in the vastness of its territory and varying\r\n interests the real need of these suffering communities was not\r\n understood by the Texas people--it had not come home to them; but that\r\n once comprehending, it would be their wish to have it known and cared\r\n for by themselves and not by others outside of the State.\r\n\r\n Assuring these poor people that their actual condition should be made\r\n known to their own people, through the authoritative means of the\r\n Red Cross, and that they should be speedily cared for, we bade them\r\n farewell and hurried away to Dallas, where we intended to send out a\r\n statement to the people of the State.\r\n\r\n Arriving there, we sought an interview with Colonel Belo, of the\r\n Dallas “News,” and laid before him the result of our observations.\r\n He placed the columns of his paper at our disposal, and through them\r\n we enlightened the people of the true status of affairs in their own\r\n State. The response was as quick as it was gratifying, and thence\r\n onward there was no further necessity for appealing to any one outside\r\n of the State limits. Indeed, that act in the first place was the\r\n greatest mistake, as to the average Texan, feeling a genuine pride in\r\n the State’s wealth and resources, it savored of frauds and imposition,\r\n and prejudiced him against the brother who would pass him by and\r\n appeal to outsiders.\r\n\r\n The Texas Legislature appropriated one hundred thousand dollars for\r\n food, and in the meantime rain began to fall and the entire aspect\r\n of affairs began to change for the better. But there were still many\r\n needs unprovided for--clothing, fuel, seeds for gardens and fields,\r\n live stock, and many other things--and it was necessary to place these\r\n needs before the people. This the “News” took upon itself to do; and\r\n upon my suggestion it opened a popular subscription and announced that\r\n it would receive contributions of seed or cash and would publish the\r\n same from day to day and turn them over to the constituted authorities\r\n appointed to disburse them. In order to encourage the movement I\r\n inaugurated it with the first subscription, and from that time until\r\n now I do not believe any one has heard of any need in Texas that has\r\n not been taken care of by her own people.\r\n\r\nThe Texas famine brought into sharp relief the ideals of Clara Barton\r\nin emergencies of this character. It was at first proposed to meet the\r\nsituation by a Government appropriation; and a bill for such relief,\r\npassed by both houses of Congress, was promptly vetoed by President\r\nCleveland. This veto brought severe criticism upon the President, but\r\nClara Barton sustained him. What was needed in such an emergency,\r\nas she believed, was not to fly to Congress with appeals for an\r\nappropriation, but to call upon the people to send relief through an\r\naccredited agency that would account for the money and disburse it in\r\nsystematic fashion. Her success in the Texas famine abundantly proved\r\nthe wisdom of her course.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOUNT VERNON, ILLINOIS, TORNADO\r\n\r\n On Sunday, February 19, 1888, a destructive tornado occurred at Mount\r\n Vernon, Illinois. Within three minutes after the fury of the storm had\r\n struck the town, thirty people had been killed and scores of others\r\n injured, and an immense amount of property destroyed.\r\n\r\n To add to the horrors already wrought, fire broke out in a dozen\r\n places. Those who were uninjured quickly came to the rescue, quenching\r\n the flames and exerting themselves to relieve the unfortunate victims,\r\n who were, in most cases, pinned down under the wreckage of their\r\n houses. All night long these brave men and women worked, and when\r\n morning came the few houses that remained standing were filled with\r\n the dead and injured.\r\n\r\n Appeals for assistance were sent out to the people of the country,\r\n but, through an improper statement of the situation, the public\r\n was misled, and, not realizing the pressing needs of the stricken\r\n community, failed to take up the matter in a business-like manner, and\r\n the town was left to suffer for a little of the great abundance that\r\n was around them. In their extremity the despairing citizens appealed\r\n to the Red Cross for aid, which responded at once.\r\n\r\n A most deplorable situation was presented: the people were homeless\r\n and helpless, neglected, and in a state of mind bordering on insanity.\r\n\r\n After a somewhat hasty examination of the situation, the following\r\n simple message was sent to both the Associated and the United Press:\r\n\r\n The pitiless snow is falling on the heads of three thousand people who\r\n are without homes, without food or clothing and without money.\r\n\r\n  CLARA BARTON\r\n\r\n\r\nWith only this little word to explain the needs, our generous American\r\npeople responded promptly and liberally, as they always do when they\r\nfully understand what is needed.\r\n\r\nIt was unnecessary to remain longer than two weeks with these people,\r\nwho, as soon as they recovered from the first shock of their great\r\nmisfortune, and when they felt that kind friends were by their side,\r\nlending them moral and substantial support, manfully commenced to\r\nbring order out of chaos, to rebuild their town and resume their usual\r\nvocations. Large quantities of relief supplies of all kinds quickly\r\ncame to hand, and, when we were ready to leave them, the Citizens’\r\nCommittee had in its treasury a cash balance of ninety thousand\r\ndollars. And thus, with their blessings ringing in our ears, we left\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YELLOW FEVER EPIDEMIC IN FLORIDA IN 1888\r\n\r\n During the month of August, 1888, yellow fever broke out in\r\n Jacksonville, and in September it was declared to be epidemic, the\r\n usual alarm and exodus of citizens taking place. On September 8,\r\n heroic measures to depopulate the city were taken. Every person that\r\n was still well and could leave was requested to go; very little urging\r\n was necessary. Camps were established outside of the city, where those\r\n who had not the means to go farther and get better quarters were\r\n enabled to live under medical surveillance, and away from the seat of\r\n infection.\r\n\r\n The mayor of Jacksonville had made an appeal for doctors and nurses,\r\n which had been quickly responded to, and they were doing everything\r\n possible to attend to the rapidly increasing number of patients.\r\n\r\n On the formation of the Red Cross Society of New Orleans in 1893,\r\n it had been carefully and wisely arranged that, in case of yellow\r\n fever becoming epidemic in any place, no unacclimated persons, or\r\n those not immune, should be sent as assistants by the Red Cross. New\r\n Orleans was the home of the famous “Old Howard Association,” that\r\n had won its reputation and worn its grateful renown from the horrors\r\n of Memphis to the present time. This body freely united with the Red\r\n Cross of New Orleans, and it was arranged that the Southern States,\r\n through this society, should provide all Red Cross nurses for yellow\r\n fever, and that the northern portion of the country should raise the\r\n money to pay and provide them. We felt this to be a security, and an\r\n immediate provision which the country had never before known. Fearing\r\n that this might not, at its first inception, be fully understood,\r\n I called at once on Dr. Hamilton, then in charge of the Marine\r\n Hospital, explaining it to him, and offering all the nurses that\r\n could be required, even to hundreds, all experienced and organized\r\n for immediate action. Perhaps it was not strange that a provision,\r\n so new and so unknown in the sad history of plagues and epidemics,\r\n should have seemed Utopian, and as such been brushed aside as not only\r\n useless, but self-seeking and obtrusive. Like the entire organization\r\n of which it was a part, it had to wait and win its way against custom\r\n or even prejudice, by honest worth and stern necessity. It was the\r\n “old, old story.” The world takes reform hard and slow.\r\n\r\n As it was, however, we did what we could. Headquarters were\r\n established at the Riggs House in Washington. The good-hearted people\r\n of the North, who felt that they must go to Florida, had by some means\r\n gotten the idea that they must have a pass from the Central Committee\r\n of the Red Cross in order to go. They came to us in hundreds and\r\n were mercifully held back from a scourge for which they would have\r\n been both food and fuel, whilst the entire people of the country,\r\n in pity and horror at the reports received, were holding meetings,\r\n raising money, and pouring funds like water into the doomed city of\r\n Jacksonville, where the scourge had centered, and to which every\r\n effort was made to confine it.\r\n\r\n Not realizing the opposition there might prove to be to our nurses,\r\n we called upon their old-time leader, Colonel F. R. Southmayd,\r\n the efficient secretary of the Red Cross Society of New Orleans,\r\n instructing him to enlist a body of nurses and take them at once to\r\n the fever district. He enlisted thirty, both men and women, white and\r\n colored, took a part with him, the remainder following next day.\r\n\r\n Refugees who had fled from Jacksonville carried the plague to several\r\n smaller places in the surrounding country, where in some instances it\r\n acquired quite a foothold; but, owing to their obscurity and the lack\r\n of communication with the outside world, they were left alone to fight\r\n the disease as best they could. Among these places was the little town\r\n of MacClenny, where, as soon as it became known that there was a case\r\n of fever within its limits, all trains were ordered to rush through\r\n without stopping, and an armed quarantine was placed around it with\r\n orders to shoot any one attempting to leave the town. Thus left to\r\n their fate, without doctors, nurses, or food, in any quantity, their\r\n situation was pitiable. There were a number of volunteers who had made\r\n attempts to get into MacClenny, but, owing to the unreasoning panic\r\n existing, they were not permitted to enter the place.\r\n\r\n Colonel Southmayd had heard of these neglected people, and he\r\n succeeded while _en route_ to Jacksonville in dropping off ten nurses\r\n so much needed at MacClenny. How he did this, I have told in a little\r\n brochure entitled “The MacClenny Nurses,” that was issued at the close\r\n of the year 1888.\r\n\r\n The fever spread during the fall to several points in Georgia,\r\n Alabama, and Mississippi, and resulted in the usual panic and flight\r\n from many places; but happily the disease got no great headway before\r\n the frost put an end to its career.\r\n\r\n It was late in November when we closed this work; worn and\r\n disheartened as we were by both the needful and the needless hardships\r\n of the campaign, we were glad of the two or three months in which no\r\n call for action was made upon us.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JOHNSTOWN FLOOD OF 1889\r\n\r\n On the 30th of May, 1889, occurred the calamity of Johnstown,\r\n Pennsylvania, with all its horrors. So frightful and improbable were\r\n the reports that it required twenty-four hours to satisfy ourselves\r\n that it was not a canard.\r\n\r\n In order to get an intelligent idea of this disaster and the terrible\r\n damage wrought by the irresistible waters, it may be well to give a\r\n short sketch of the city of Johnstown and its adjacent surroundings.\r\n Before the flood there were thirty thousand people in this busy\r\n community, which embraced the city of Johnstown proper and numerous\r\n suburbs. The city is situated at the junction of Stony Creek and the\r\n Little Conemaugh, forming the Conemaugh River. These streams are\r\n liable to sudden overflows, and, owing to the contraction of the\r\n waterway in the lower part of the city by the dumping of cinders and\r\n slag from the large ironworks on the banks of the stream, and also\r\n encroachments by riparian owners, the upper portion of the city is\r\n liable to inundations. About nine miles above the city a dam had been\r\n thrown across the Little Conemaugh River many years ago for commercial\r\n purposes, but had been abandoned and the site with much surrounding\r\n property had been subsequently purchased by a sporting club, whose\r\n membership embraced some of the wealthiest citizens of Pennsylvania.\r\n These gentlemen were attracted by the picturesque scenery and the\r\n hunting and fishing of the vicinity, and they spent thousands of\r\n dollars in improving and beautifying their holdings. The dam was\r\n raised to a height of over seventy feet and held an immense body of\r\n water covering many acres.\r\n\r\n This large mass of water was a constant source of fear to the\r\n inhabitants of the lower valleys, who were aware of the danger that\r\n threatened them, and many protests were made against the continuance\r\n of the danger; but owing to the prominence of the owners of the dam,\r\n and the strong social and political influence they exerted, they\r\n remained unmolested in the possession of the monster that was to break\r\n its bounds and carry death and destruction in its pitiless pathway.\r\n\r\n A steady rainfall for several days in the latter part of May caused\r\n overflows in all the streams in western Pennsylvania, and much of the\r\n city of Johnstown was already under water to a depth of from two to\r\n ten feet, when suddenly the dam over the Little Conemaugh gave way,\r\n and its flood, resembling a moving mountain of water thirty feet high,\r\n was precipitated upon the doomed city. Numbers of the inhabitants,\r\n who had carried the fear of this disaster in their minds for years,\r\n had become so alarmed by the long-continued rains, and the floods\r\n that were already upon them, took their families and fled to the high\r\n grounds on the hillsides. But the great majority of the people, who,\r\n though fully aware of the danger, had lived with it so long that they\r\n had become careless and indifferent, took no precautions whatever.\r\n These were overwhelmed by the tide almost without warning, and before\r\n they could seek safety were swept away.\r\n\r\n The number of lives lost will never be accurately known; but in all\r\n probability it reached in the entire valley nearly five thousand. It\r\n is said that property to the amount of twelve millions of dollars was\r\n absolutely lost.\r\n\r\n It was at the moment of supreme affliction when we arrived at\r\n Johnstown. The waters had subsided, and those of the inhabitants who\r\n had escaped the fate of their fellows were gazing over the scene of\r\n destruction and trying to arouse themselves from the lethargy that had\r\n taken hold of them when they were stunned by the realization of all\r\n the woe that had been visited upon them. How nobly they responded to\r\n the call of duty! How much of the heroic there is in our people when\r\n it is needed! No idle murmurings of fate, but, true to the godlike\r\n instincts of manhood and fraternal love, they quickly banded together\r\n to do the best that the wisest among them could suggest.\r\n\r\n For five weary months it was our portion to live amid these scenes\r\n of destruction, desolation, poverty, want, and woe; sometimes in\r\n tents, sometimes without; in rain and mud, and a lack of the commonest\r\n comforts, until we could build houses to shelter ourselves and those\r\n around us. Without a safe, and with a dry-goods box for a desk, we\r\n conducted financial affairs in money and material to the extent of\r\n nearly half a million dollars.\r\n\r\n When our five months’ work was completed, we had only to turn over to\r\n the hands of the leaders of the town, our warehouse with its entire\r\n remaining stock, amounting to some thousands of dollars; the care\r\n of the infirmary; one of our trained clerks, with all papers and\r\n accounts of our relief work from the day of its inception; one of\r\n our experienced working men to handle transportation--to fit up for\r\n them large, warm rooms for winter use; give them our blessing; accept\r\n theirs in fullest measure; say good-bye to them and to our faithful\r\n helpers, with heavy hearts and choking voices, and return to our home,\r\n bearing the record of a few months of faithful endeavor among a people\r\n as patient and brave as people are made, as noble and grateful as\r\n falls to the lot of human nature to be. Enterprising, industrious,\r\n and hopeful, the new Johnstown, phœnix-like, rose from its ruins more\r\n beautiful than the old, with a ceaseless throb of grateful memory for\r\n every kind act rendered, and every thought of sympathy given her in\r\n her great hour of desolation and woe. God bless her, and God bless all\r\n who helped save her!\r\n\r\n We had employed during our sojourn in Johnstown a working force of\r\n fifty men and women, whom we had housed, fed, and paid, with the\r\n exception of the volunteers who worked for the good they could do and\r\n would accept nothing. The means which we so largely handled came from\r\n everywhere; accounts were rendered for everything, and no word of\r\n business complication ever came to us. There never has in all our work.\r\n\r\n There was much to do in Johnstown after we left; buildings to remove\r\n and property to care for when it had served its purpose and the ground\r\n became needed. But there is always a right time for any benevolent\r\n work to cease; a time when the community is ready to resume its own\r\n burdens, and when an offered charity is an insult to the honest and\r\n independent, and a degradation to the careless and improvident,\r\n tending to pauperize and make them an added burden on their\r\n better-minded fellow citizens. And then, the moment the tradesman is\r\n able to reëstablish himself, he looks with jealous eyes on any agency\r\n that diverts possible business from his channels. Thus it is not only\r\n wise, but just to all concerned to withdraw all gratuities from a\r\n people the instant they are able to gain even a meager self-support.\r\n\r\n A rather curious circumstance, somewhat on the line of this\r\n reflection, fell to our lot after leaving Johnstown. The houses that\r\n we had built and furnished were indispensable to the tenants during\r\n the winter, when there were no other houses to be had; but in the\r\n spring the city, rejuvenated, began to build up again, and we were\r\n notified that the land on which our large houses were standing was\r\n needed by the owners, who wished to use it for their own purposes, and\r\n they requested the Red Cross to remove its buildings. We promptly sent\r\n an agent to attend to the matter, and he began the work of vacating\r\n the premises. There was no hardship involved in this, as all the\r\n tenants were by this time in condition to pay rent, the relief fund of\r\n $1,600,000 having been distributed among them in proportion to their\r\n losses, and there were houses that they could get; in a few days our\r\n houses were empty. Then a new factor entered into the situation. When\r\n it became generally known that the Red Cross must remove these immense\r\n houses, and that a large quantity of lumber and house furnishings\r\n were to be disposed of, the self-interests of the dealers in those\r\n commodities were at once aroused, and they strongly protested against\r\n the gratuitous distribution of those articles among the people of\r\n Johnstown, asserting that the inhabitants were now prospering and had\r\n the means to buy everything they needed, and that a gift from us of\r\n any of these things would be an injustice to the honest traders who\r\n were trying to reëstablish themselves.\r\n\r\n We saw the justice of their objection and gave assurances that no\r\n injury should be done them; still, to have fully conformed to their\r\n idea and transported the entire material to some other point would\r\n have put the Red Cross to an amount of trouble and cost unjust to\r\n itself.\r\n\r\n I am not prepared to say that our quiet field agent in charge of the\r\n work did not find resting-places for very much of this material in\r\n still needy homes, where it did no harm to any one and for which no\r\n one but the pitiful recipients were the wiser.\r\n\r\n Notwithstanding the fact that we took away from Johnstown as little\r\n material and furniture as was possible, after quietly disposing of\r\n the greater part of it, and this at an expense and inconvenience\r\n to ourselves which we could ill afford, there were those who could\r\n not understand why we should take _anything_ away; and their unkind\r\n misconstruction and criticisms have scarcely ceased echoing even to\r\n this late day.\r\n\r\n The paths of charity are over roadways of ashes; and he who would\r\n tread them must be prepared to meet opposition, misconstruction,\r\n jealousy, and calumny. Let his work be that of angels, still it will\r\n not satisfy all.\r\n\r\n There is always an aftermath of attempted relief where none is needed,\r\n and more or less criticism of any work, for it is always so much\r\n easier to say how a thing ought to be done than it is to do it.\r\n\r\n These little unpleasantnesses, however, cannot deprive us of the\r\n thousand memories of gratitude, appreciation, and kindnesses\r\n exchanged, which were mutually helpful; nor of the many lifelong\r\n friendships formed which will bless us all our day.\r\n\r\nAs Miss Barton was leaving Johnstown the “Daily Tribune” of that city\r\npublished the following editorial:\r\n\r\n How shall we thank Miss Clara Barton and the Red Cross for the help\r\n they have given us? It cannot be done; and if it could, Miss Barton\r\n does not want our thanks. She has simply done her duty as she saw\r\n it and received her pay--the consciousness of a duty performed\r\n to the best of her ability. To see us upon our feet, struggling\r\n forward, helping ourselves, caring for the sick and infirm and\r\n impoverished--that is enough for Miss Barton. Her idea has been fully\r\n worked out, all her plans accomplished. What more could such a woman\r\n wish?\r\n\r\n We cannot thank Miss Barton in words. Hunt the dictionaries of all\r\n languages through and you will not find the signs to express our\r\n appreciation of her and her work. Try to describe the sunshine. Try to\r\n describe the starlight. Words fail, and in dumbness and silence we bow\r\n to the idea which brought her here. God and humanity! Never were they\r\n more closely linked than in stricken Johnstown.\r\n\r\nGovernor Beaver of Pennsylvania expressed the appreciation of the\r\npeople of the State in the following letter:\r\n\r\n In this matter of sheltering the people, as in others of like\r\n importance, Miss Clara Barton, president of the Red Cross Association,\r\n was most helpful. At a time when there was a doubt if the Flood\r\n Commission could furnish houses of suitable character and with the\r\n requisite promptness, she offered to assume charge, and she erected\r\n with the funds of the association three large apartment houses which\r\n afforded comfortable lodgings for many houseless people. She was among\r\n the first to arrive on the scene of calamity, bringing with her Dr.\r\n Hubbell, the field officer of the Red Cross Association, and a staff\r\n of skilled assistants. She made her own organization for relief work\r\n in every form, disposing of the large resources under her control with\r\n such wisdom and tenderness that the charity of the Red Cross had no\r\n sting, and its recipients are not Miss Barton’s dependents, but her\r\n friends. She was also the last of the ministering spirits to leave\r\n the scene of her labors, and she left her apartment houses for use\r\n during the winter, and turned over her warehouse, with its store of\r\n furniture, bedding and clothing and a well-equipped infirmary, to the\r\n Union Benevolent Association of the Conemaugh Valley, the organization\r\n of which she advised and helped to form; and its lady visitors have\r\n so well performed their work that the dreaded winter has no terrors,\r\n mendicancy has been repressed, and not a single case of unrelieved\r\n suffering is known to have occurred in all the flooded district.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RUSSIAN FAMINE OF 1891-92\r\n\r\n To understand properly the Russian Famine of 1891-92, and the relief\r\n work of the Red Cross connected therewith, one needs to keep in mind\r\n the ordinary moral and economic condition of the Russian peasantry.\r\n They were, many of them, not long ago serfs attached to the land\r\n in a condition but little better than American slaves. Though the\r\n liberation of the serfs made their legal condition better, it left\r\n them in condition scarcely less discouraging than before. They were\r\n subject to all the disabilities of hard bargains on every side, from\r\n the exactions of taxes levied in one way or another, and payable\r\n in services or goods, all of which called for an ever-increasing\r\n sacrifice. They were subject to onerous military service, and penal\r\n exactions for violations of the law. These conditions surrounded\r\n them with an atmosphere of depressing poverty, fear, and hopeless\r\n endurance, if not of despair. They have not felt the stimulating\r\n habitual influence of hope, of courage, of enterprise. They are not\r\n educated to surmount discouragements by overcoming them. Difficulties\r\n do not down easily before them; they go down before difficulties and\r\n disasters in something like apathetic despondency, or live in an\r\n amazing light-hearted, careless recklessness that easily turns to\r\n drink, to idleness, weakness, disease, and early death. Fear is with\r\n them always, as if fate was over and against them.\r\n\r\n The climate of Russia is cold in winter, and the means of cooking and\r\n artificial warmth are scanty, and not easily procured at any time;\r\n thus, when the famine really came upon them, observers were divided in\r\n opinion whether the famine, or fear of famine, or of something worse,\r\n destroyed or paralyzed these people the more.\r\n\r\n The harvest yields of 1889 and 1890 had been much less than an\r\n average, and at the beginning of 1891 but little of the old supplies\r\n of grain was left over. The harvest of 1891 was nearly a total\r\n failure throughout a vast region in central Russia extending from\r\n Moscow, roughly speaking, say, three hundred miles in a northeasterly\r\n direction over a plain eight hundred to a thousand miles in width,\r\n beyond the Ural Mountains, and some distance into Siberia in Asiatic\r\n Russia--a district of nearly a million square miles. Ordinarily this\r\n is the most productive part of the Empire, upon which the remainder\r\n of the country had been accustomed to draw for food supplies in the\r\n frequent cases of deficiency elsewhere. The appearance of the country\r\n is similar to our prairie States in the early days before the growth\r\n of the planted trees; and the soil is a rich, black loam that usually\r\n produces good harvests.\r\n\r\n It was estimated by those best qualified to judge that from thirty to\r\n thirty-five millions of people were sufferers by the famine of 1891.\r\n\r\n Count Tolstoy gave up his whole time to mitigating the suffering\r\n caused by this great disaster, and to understanding the situation\r\n broadly. He went into the homes of the people, and studied their\r\n needs sympathetically; he placed himself by their side, and with his\r\n dramatic instinct understood them, ascertained where the hurt was\r\n felt, and how it could be cured, if it could be cured at all.\r\n\r\n At that time the Count wrote of these poor unfortunates: “I asked them\r\n what sort of a harvest they had had, and how they were getting along;\r\n and they replied in a blithe, offhand manner: ‘Oh, right enough, God\r\n be praised!’ And yet these people who reside in the most distressed\r\n districts of the government of Toula, cannot possibly live through\r\n the winter, _unless they bestir themselves in time_. They are bound\r\n to die of hunger, or some disease engendered by hunger, as surely as\r\n a hive of bees left to face the rigors of a northern winter, without\r\n honey or sweets, must perish miserably before the advent of spring.\r\n The all-important question, therefore, is this: Will they exert\r\n themselves while yet they possess the strength, if, indeed, it be not\r\n already wholly exhausted? Everything that I saw or heard pointed with\r\n terrible distinctness to a negative reply. One of these farmers had\r\n sold out the meager possessions which he could call his own, and had\r\n left for Moscow to work or beg. The others stayed on and waited with\r\n naïve curiosity watching for what would happen next, like children,\r\n who, having fallen into a hole in the ice, or lost their way in a\r\n dense forest and not realizing at first the terrible danger of their\r\n situation, heartily laugh at its unwontedness.”\r\n\r\n “Unless they bestir themselves in time”--what a text is this! They\r\n are all the time overborne by the apathy of fear, of unused powers,\r\n of suppression and depression. Courage, hope, enterprise to bestir\r\n themselves, where will they come from? Not, surely, from fear and more\r\n discouragement.\r\n\r\n The work of the American National Red Cross in the Russian famine of\r\n 1891-92 was comparatively less than in some others of the conspicuous\r\n fields in which it had done its work. The impulse to help in the\r\n work of that relief sprang up simultaneously in many American hearts\r\n and homes, in New York, in Philadelphia, in Minnesota, and Iowa.\r\n In Iowa it took the form of a veritable crusade for a most holy\r\n cause; beginning in the fervid and indomitable spirit of Miss Alice\r\n French--the “Octave Thanet” of literature--it quickly enlisted Mr. B.\r\n F. Tillinghast, editor of the “Davenport Democrat,” who became its\r\n director-in-chief and organizing force, everywhere organizing it,\r\n and promoting it in every direction and in every form. The movement\r\n was taken up by the women of Iowa, and Governor Boies became a prime\r\n mover, till the whole State at last joined in a triumphal march\r\n bearing corn, God’s best gift to man, to the Atlantic coast in a\r\n procession of two hundred and twenty-five carloads, exceeding five\r\n hundred bushels in each car. The corn was consigned to Clara Barton in\r\n New York and reached her agents there without accident or delay.\r\n\r\n The American National Red Cross had authentic intelligence of the\r\n famine in Russia before it had attracted general attention; it had\r\n placed itself in communication with the Secretary of State, the\r\n Honorable James G. Blaine, and the Russian Chargé d’Affaires at\r\n Washington, Mr. Alexander Gregor, and had ascertained that Russia\r\n would gladly receive any donations of relief that the people of\r\n America might send to her famine-stricken people. Not only would\r\n they receive supplies, but would send their ships for them, and\r\n provide inland transportation from Russian ports to the destitute\r\n people for whom these benefactions were intended. America declined\r\n to allow her suffering sister nation to cross the seas to get this\r\n food, and quickly arranged to carry it to her. All the American\r\n agencies concerned in this movement met it in the noblest spirit;\r\n railroad companies gave free transportation, telegraph companies the\r\n free use of wires, brokers and steamship agents declined their usual\r\n commissions, and some insurance companies even gave premiums for the\r\n safe delivery of the precious cargo into the hands of the starving\r\n people. Funds to charter a steamship to carry the cargo to Russia were\r\n soon raised and placed in the hands of the Red Cross.\r\n\r\n Dr. Hubbell, representative of the Red Cross to the international\r\n conference of the Red Cross to be held at Rome, and authorized to\r\n proceed to Riga and receive and distribute with the Russian Red Cross\r\n this gift of Iowa, was already on his ocean voyage and ready to do\r\n his part in this beautiful blending of international courtesies and\r\n services that it is the mission of the Red Cross to devise and to\r\n carry out wherever it can make or find the fitting opportunity. Dr.\r\n Hubbell arrived on time at Riga and superintended the distribution of\r\n the cargo.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEA ISLANDS HURRICANE OF 1893-94\r\n\r\n It is probable that there are few instances on record where a movement\r\n toward relief of such magnitude, commenced under circumstances so new,\r\n so unexpected, so unprepared, and so adverse, was ever carried on for\r\n such a length of time and closed with results so entirely satisfactory\r\n to both those served and those serving, as this disaster, which, if\r\n remembered at all at the present day, is designated as the “Hurricane\r\n and Tidal Wave of the Sea Islands off the Coast of South Carolina.”\r\n The descriptions of this fearful catastrophe I shall leave to the\r\n reports of those who saw, shared its dangers, and lived within its\r\n tide of death. They will tell how from three thousand to five thousand\r\n human beings (for no one knew the number) went down in a night; how\r\n in the blackness of despair they clung to the swaying tree-tops till\r\n the roots gave way, and together they were covered in the sands or\r\n washed out to the reckless billows of the great mad ocean that had\r\n sent for them; of the want, woe, and nothingness that the ensuing\r\n days revealed when the winds were hushed, the waters stilled, and the\r\n frightened survivors began to look for the lost home and the loved\r\n ones, and hunger presaged the gaunt figure of famine that silently\r\n drew near and stared them in the face; how, with all vegetable growth\r\n destroyed, all animals, even to fowls, swept away, all fresh water\r\n turned to salt--not even a sweet well remaining--not one little house\r\n in five hundred left upright, if left at all; the victims with the\r\n clothing torn and washed off them, till they were more nearly naked\r\n than clothed--how these thirty thousand people patiently stood and\r\n faced this silent second messenger of death threatening them hour by\r\n hour. Largely ignorant, knowing nothing of the world, with no real\r\n dependencies upon any section of its people, they could only wait\r\n its charity, its pity, its rescue, and its care--wait and pray--does\r\n any one who knows the negro characteristics and attributes doubt\r\n this latter? Surely, if angels do listen, they heard pleading enough\r\n in those hours of agony to save even the last man and woman and the\r\n helpless babe. Something saved them, for there is no record of one who\r\n died of starvation or perished through lack of care.\r\n\r\n About the 28th or 29th of August, 1893, the press commenced to give\r\n notice, such as it could get over wrecked roads and broken wires, of\r\n a fearful storm coming up from the West Indies that had struck our\r\n coast in the region of South Carolina, sweeping entirely over its\r\n adjacent range of islands, known as the Old Port Royal group, covering\r\n them from the sea to a depth of sixteen feet, with the wind at a rate\r\n of one hundred and twenty miles an hour--that its destructive power\r\n was so great that it had not only swept the islands, but had extended\r\n several miles on to the mainland of the State.\r\n\r\n I chanced to be familiar with the geography and topography of that\r\n group of islands, having lived on them in the capacity of war relief\r\n many months during the siege of Charleston in 1863-64. Knowing that\r\n they scarcely averaged four feet rise above the sea level, with no\r\n mountains, not even hills that could be called such, that the soft,\r\n sandy soil could not be trusted to hold its tree roots firm, that the\r\n habitations were only huts, to be washed away like little piles of\r\n boards--I thought I saw no escape for the inhabitants and that _all_\r\n must have perished; and so replied to all inquiries at first made as\r\n to whether this were not a disaster for the Red Cross to relieve,\r\n “No, there was nothing left to relieve.” Later and more reliable news\r\n brought the astonishing fact that it was estimated that from thirty to\r\n forty thousand had survived and were in the direst need. Was not this\r\n a call for the Red Cross? Still more emphatically, “No; if that is the\r\n case, it is beyond the Red Cross. Only the State of South Carolina or\r\n the general Government can cope with that”; and again we closed our\r\n ears and proceeded with our work.\r\n\r\n But the first week of September brought pitiful paragraphs from\r\n various Southern sources--one I recall from the governor of the State,\r\n in which he proclaimed his perplexity and great distress at the\r\n condition of these poor people, needing everything, and who, at that\r\n season of the year, with crops all destroyed, would continue to need;\r\n and closed by wondering “if the Red Cross could perhaps do anything\r\n for them.”\r\n\r\n It would not do to close our ears or eyes against this suggestion, and\r\n I at once sought our congressional neighbor, General M. C. Butler, of\r\n South Carolina, then in the Senate, asking his views. The response\r\n was such as would not have been looked for in that busy, hard-worked\r\n Senator, surrounded by a network of political wires, some of them only\r\n too likely to be “live”; he dropped all business, telegraphed at once\r\n to Governor Tillman at Columbia to learn the conditions, and urgently\r\n requested us to go, and he would even leave his seat and go with us\r\n as soon as we could be ready. Time is never a question with the Red\r\n Cross, and the next night, in a dark, cheerless September mist, with\r\n only two assistants, I closed a door behind me for ten months, went to\r\n the station to meet General Butler, prompt and kind, and proceeded on\r\n our way. At Columbia we were joyfully surprised at meeting Governor\r\n Tillman, prepared to accompany us with a member of his staff, and thus\r\n powerfully reënforced we made our entrance into Beaufort.\r\n\r\n The work of relief had been wisely placed at first in the hands of\r\n committees from both Beaufort and Charleston, comprising the best\r\n business men of each city--its lawyers, merchants, bankers, all men of\r\n prominence and known practical ability. They had done and were doing\r\n all possible for them to do, with hearts full of pity, hands full of\r\n work, themselves large losers by the storm, business nearly wrecked,\r\n and needing every remaining energy for the repairing of their own\r\n damages and those of the citizens about them.\r\n\r\n The governor, at whose request they had formed, realizing the\r\n necessities of the case, sought to release them, calling them\r\n together in each city and successively relieving them, placing the\r\n Red Cross in full charge of the relief. With the little knowledge we\r\n had of the conditions and surroundings, it would have been madness to\r\n accept, at least until both more knowledge and more numerical force\r\n were gained, and the refusal was as prompt as the proffer had been.\r\n We, however, promised to remain in Beaufort, meet with the committee\r\n each day, advise with them, study the situation and report our\r\n conclusions when we could safely arrive at them.\r\n\r\n Thus we remained until the first day of October, realizing that the\r\n relief coming in from outside would soon diminish as the excitement\r\n should wear away, that the sum in hand was painfully small, that the\r\n number of destitute was steadily increasing, that the winter was\r\n approaching and that they must be carried through in some manner till\r\n the next year’s crops could grow; and that, in order to do this a\r\n fixed system of relief must be adopted, a rigid economy enforced, and\r\n every person who could do so must be made to work for his food and\r\n receive food and raiment only in return for labor; that this could\r\n come only from persons who had no interests but these to subserve\r\n and with the light of all experience that could be called to the\r\n task. Even then a successful result was questionable; but there was\r\n no question of the fatal result of any other course, and after a\r\n thoughtful council of our official board (which had meanwhile become\r\n nearly filled) on the night of September 30 it was decided that the\r\n Red Cross would accept the appointment of the governor and enter upon\r\n its duties the following day.\r\n\r\n Accordingly, at the meeting of the next day, October 1, 4 P.M., the\r\n Beaufort Relief Commission, as appointed by the governor, was formally\r\n released as a committee and immediately reëlected by the Red Cross as\r\n its “advisory board,” to meet and advise with us as we had done with\r\n them.\r\n\r\n Through all these years the tenderness springs to my heart and gathers\r\n in my eyes as I recall the kindly and affectionate intercourse of\r\n months, without one break, that grew up between us. And although some\r\n have been called to higher service and greener fields, I am confident\r\n that none of us will ever seek on this side a better, more trusted,\r\n kindlier association than were found in these.\r\n\r\n If it be desirable to understand when to commence a work of relief,\r\n to know if the objects presented are actually such as to be benefited\r\n by the assistance which would be rendered, it is no less desirable\r\n and indispensable that one knows when to end such relief, in order to\r\n avoid, first, the weakening of effort and powers for self-sustenance;\r\n second, the encouragement of a tendency to beggary and pauperism,\r\n by dependence upon others which should be assumed by the persons\r\n themselves. It has always been the practice of the Red Cross to watch\r\n this matter closely and leave a field at the suitable moment when it\r\n could do so without injury or unnecessary suffering, thus leaving a\r\n wholesome stimulus on the part of the beneficiaries to help not only\r\n themselves individually, but each other.\r\n\r\n Seldom a field, or any considerable work of relief which may have\r\n attracted public notice, comes to a close that there does not some\r\n person or body of persons arise and propose to continue the work\r\n under some new form, but using the former well-established sources of\r\n supplies; to put out new appeals to old patrons, detailing great need,\r\n newly discovered, and thus keep the sympathetic public forever on the\r\n anxious seats of never-ending pity and help. We have been compelled to\r\n guard against this at the close of every long-continued field, notably\r\n Johnstown, where it became necessary for the citizens to organize a\r\n “Home Relief” to keep sensational strangers off the ground, and their\r\n well-arranged “Benevolent Union” of to-day is the result.\r\n\r\n The Sea Islands were no exception, and at the last moment of our stay\r\n a well-drawn petition was discovered (for it was to be kept concealed\r\n until we were gone), and was checked only by the vigorous aid of the\r\n Charleston “News and Courier,” of June 25, 1894, always our stay and\r\n friend in time of trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nARMENIA IN 1895 AND 1896\r\n\r\n In November, 1895, the press commenced to warn us of a possible\r\n call for the relief of the terrible sufferings of Armenia, which\r\n were engaging the attention of the civilized world. These warnings\r\n were followed later by a letter from the Reverend Judson Smith,\r\n D.D., of Boston, secretary of the American Board of Commissioners\r\n for Foreign Missions, referring his suggestion back to the Reverend\r\n Henry O. Dwight, D.D., of the American Board of Foreign Missions\r\n at Constantinople. The American Red Cross was requested by these\r\n representative gentlemen to undertake the distribution of relief\r\n funds among the sufferers of Armenia. Owing to the disturbed\r\n condition of the country and of its strict laws, combined as they\r\n were with existing racial and religious differences, it was found\r\n almost impossible at the moment to distribute the relief needed.\r\n The faithful but distressed resident missionaries were themselves\r\n helpless sufferers to a great extent and practically prisoners in\r\n their own houses. These had not always been spared to them in the\r\n wild excitement which reigned for several months previous, otherwise\r\n they would have been the normal channels for distributing aid. This\r\n written request from Dr. Smith was nearly identical with a similar one\r\n from Mr. Spencer Trask, of New York, who, with others, was about to\r\n form a National Armenian Relief Committee, to be established in that\r\n city. Following their letters, both of these gentlemen, Dr. Smith and\r\n Mr. Trask, came to Washington personally to urge our compliance with\r\n the request that we accept the charge of this distribution of relief\r\n funds. Accustomed to the trials, responsibilities, and hardships of\r\n field relief labor, this proposition seemed something to be shrunk\r\n from rather than accepted and we naturally hesitated. The idea,\r\n however, became public, and a general importunity on the part of\r\n the people became prevalent. The necessity for immediate action was\r\n urged; human beings were starving and could not be reached, hundreds\r\n of towns and villages had not been heard from since the fire and\r\n sword went over them, and no one else was so well prepared for the\r\n work of field relief, it was said, as ourselves. It was urged that we\r\n had a trained force of field workers, and as Turkey was one of the\r\n signatory powers to the Red Cross Treaty of Geneva, having given its\r\n adhesion as long ago as July, 1865, it must consequently be familiar\r\n with its methods and humanitarian ideas. Thus it was hoped that she\r\n would the more readily accept its presence than that of a more strange\r\n body of workers. These are only a shadowing of the reasons urged on\r\n behalf of our acceptance. Under this pressure, coupled with our strong\r\n sympathies, the subject was taken into serious consideration with the\r\n simple demand on our part of two positive assurances: first, we must\r\n be assured by the committees that we were the choice of the people of\r\n the entire country, that there was no opposition to us, and that there\r\n was perfect unanimity between themselves; there must be nowhere any\r\n discord; the task would be difficult enough under the best conditions.\r\n Second, that they had the funds to distribute. Assured on both these\r\n points, our promise was given that we would go and do our best to make\r\n the desired distribution in the interior of Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n With this ray of hope that something might be done, the pent-up\r\n sympathies of the people burst forth. Public meetings were held,\r\n addresses made, Armenian conditions estimated, horrors reproduced,\r\n responsibilities placed, causes canvassed, and opinions expressed;\r\n honest, humane, and entirely natural, precisely the course to rouse\r\n public sentiment and indignation, if that were the only or the main\r\n object in view. In consideration, however, of the relief effort, it\r\n was of questionable wisdom, perhaps, when it is borne in mind that\r\n we had yet to ask the opening of a door hitherto closed against the\r\n world, when we needed permission to enter, in order to reach the\r\n starving sufferers with the relief that was planning for them. In\r\n the enthusiasm of the hour, this fact seemed to be entirely lost\r\n sight of. It also seemed to be forgotten that if this difficult and\r\n delicate task were to be assigned to the Red Cross and its officers,\r\n the making of their mission, or of themselves personally, prominent\r\n or laudatory features of public gatherings where Ottoman officials or\r\n representatives were always listeners, could not fail to render the\r\n post more difficult and prospects of success more doubtful.\r\n\r\n The international and neutral character of the Red Cross, as a medium\r\n of relief in mitigation of war or overwhelming calamity, appeared to\r\n be overlooked or wholly misunderstood. It was not recognized that\r\n only by abstaining from discordant opinions could we be in a position\r\n to perform our work. By the obligations of the Geneva Treaty, all\r\n national controversies, racial distinctions, and differences in creed\r\n must be held in abeyance and only the needs of humanity considered.\r\n In this spirit alone can the Red Cross meet its obligations as the\r\n representative of the nations and governments of the world acting\r\n under it. But American enthusiasm is boundless, and its expression\r\n limitless; and the same breath that crushed the Ottoman Empire,\r\n scattered it to the winds or sunk it in the lowest depths, elevated\r\n the Red Cross and its proposed relief out of sight among the clouds.\r\n Precautionary remonstrance from us was in vain, but it was not until\r\n after we had publicly given our consent, made all arrangements and\r\n appointed our aids, that the fruits of these ardent demonstrations\r\n became visible in a pronunciamento through the Turkish Minister\r\n resident at Washington, prohibiting the Red Cross from entering Turkey.\r\n\r\n I found this decision on the part of the Bey and his Government\r\n very natural and politically justifiable--our own Government and\r\n people would probably have done the same or even more under similar\r\n conditions, provided similar conditions could have existed among them.\r\n I was ready to abide by the decision and remain at home. This, neither\r\n people nor committees would consent to. Of course our selected force\r\n of more than a score of trained and experienced field workers, each\r\n a specialist, must be given up. If any relief were now attempted it\r\n could only be individual, with two or three officers from headquarters\r\n as indispensable aids.\r\n\r\n Previous to the announcement of the Turkish Minister prohibiting the\r\n Red Cross from entering Turkey, the promise had been gained from\r\n us to leave by the steamship _New York_ on the 22d of January, and\r\n notwithstanding the reply to a cablegram from the Department of State\r\n to Constantinople, asking if the prohibition against the entrance of\r\n the Red Cross was really official and from the Government itself, or\r\n but semi-official, had not been received, our promise was kept and we\r\n sailed with this uncertainty resting over us.\r\n\r\n The picture of that scene is still vivid in my memory. Crowded piers,\r\n wild with hurrahs, white with parting salutes, hearts beating with\r\n exultation and expectation--a little shorn band of five, prohibited,\r\n unsustained either by Government or other authority, destined to a\r\n port five thousand miles away, from approach to which even the powers\r\n of the world had shrunk. What was it expected to do or how to do it?\r\n Visions of Don Quixote and his windmills loomed up, as I turned away\r\n and wondered.\r\n\r\n A week at sea, to be met at midnight at Southampton, by messenger\r\n down from London, to say that the prohibition was sustained, the\r\n Red Cross was forbidden, but that such persons as our minister, Mr.\r\n Terrell, would appoint, would be received. Here was another delicate\r\n uncertainty which could not be committed to Ottoman telegraph, and\r\n Dr. Hubbell was dispatched alone to Constantinople (while we waited\r\n in London) to learn from Mr. Terrell his attitude toward ourselves\r\n and our mission. Under favorable responses we proceeded, and reached\r\n Constantinople on February 15; met a most cordial reception from all\r\n our own Government officials, and located _pro tem._ at Pera Palace\r\n Hotel; it being so recently after the Stamboul massacres that no less\r\n public place was deemed safe.\r\n\r\n The following day we received in a body the members of the Missionary\r\n Board in Constantinople, including its treasurer, W. W. Peet, and\r\n Dr. Washburn, president of Robert College, and here commenced\r\n that friendly intercourse which continued without interruption,\r\n strengthening as the days wore on through the half-year that followed,\r\n till moistened eyes and warm hand-grasp at parting told more plainly\r\n than words how fraught with confidence that intercourse had been. If\r\n one would look for peers of this accomplished Christian body of our\r\n countrymen, they would only be found in the noble band of women, who,\r\n as wives, mothers, and teachers, aid their labors and share their\r\n hardships, privations, and dangers. I shall always feel it a privilege\r\n and an honor to have been called, even in a small way, to assist\r\n the efforts of this chosen body of our countrymen and women, whose\r\n faithful and devoted lives are made sacred to the service of God and\r\n their fellow men.\r\n\r\n The first step was to procure an introduction to the Government which\r\n had in one sense refused me; and accompanied by Minister Terrell and\r\n his premier interpreter, Gargiulo, perhaps the longest serving and\r\n one of the most experienced diplomatic officers in Constantinople,\r\n I called by appointment upon Tewfik Pasha, the Turkish Minister of\r\n Foreign Affairs or Minister of State. To those conversant with the\r\n personages connected with Turkish affairs, I need not say that Tewfik\r\n Pasha is probably the foremost man of the Government; a manly man,\r\n with a kind, fine face, and genial, polished manners. Educated abroad,\r\n with advanced views on general subjects, he impresses one as a man who\r\n would sanction no wrong it was in his power to avert.\r\n\r\n We were received at the Department of State in an uninterrupted\r\n interview lasting over an hour. As this was the main interview and the\r\n base of all our work, it is perhaps proper that I give it somewhat\r\n in detail. Mr. Terrell’s introduction was most appropriate and well\r\n expressed, bearing with strong emphasis upon the suffering condition\r\n of the people of the interior in consequence of the massacres, and\r\n the great sympathy of the people of America, their intense desire to\r\n help them, the heartfelt interest in their missionaries whose burdens\r\n were greater than they ought to bear, and the desire to aid them, and\r\n that for all these reasons we had been asked to come; that our objects\r\n were purely humanitarian, having neither political, racial, nor\r\n religious bearing as such; that as the head of the organization thus\r\n represented I _could_ have no other ideas, and it was the privilege\r\n of putting these ideas into practice and the protection required\r\n meanwhile that the people of America, through him and through me, were\r\n asking.\r\n\r\n The Pasha listened most attentively to the speech of Mr. Terrell,\r\n thanked him, and replied that this was well understood; that they knew\r\n the Red Cross and its president, and, turning to me, repeated: “We\r\n know you, Miss Barton; have long known you and your work. We would\r\n like to hear your plans for relief and what you desire.”\r\n\r\n I proceeded to state them, bearing fully upon the fact that the\r\n condition to which the people of the interior of Asia Minor had been\r\n reduced by recent events had aroused the sympathy of the entire\r\n American people until they asked, almost to the extent of a demand,\r\n that assistance from them should be allowed to go directly to these\r\n sufferers, hundreds of whom had friends and relatives in America--a\r\n fact which naturally strengthened both the interest and the demand;\r\n that it was at the request of our people, _en masse_, that I and a\r\n few assistants had come; that our object would be to use the funds\r\n ourselves among the people needing them wherever they were found, in\r\n helping them to resume their former positions and vocations, thus\r\n relieving them from continued distress, the State from the burden of\r\n providing for them, and other nations and people from a torrent of\r\n sympathy which was both hard to endure and unwholesome in its effects;\r\n that I had brought skilled agents, practical and experienced farmers\r\n whose first efforts would be to get the people back to their deserted\r\n fields and provide them with farming implements and material wherewith\r\n to put in summer crops and thus enable them to feed themselves. These\r\n would embrace ploughs, hoes, spades, seed-corn, wheat, and, later,\r\n sickles, scythes, etc., for harvesting, with which to save the miles\r\n of autumn grain which we had heard of as growing on the great plains\r\n already in the ground before the trouble; also to provide for them\r\n such cattle and other animals as it would be possible to purchase or\r\n to get back; that if some such thing were not done before another\r\n winter, unless we had been greatly misinformed, the suffering there\r\n would shock the entire civilized world. None of us knew from personal\r\n observations, as yet, the full need of assistance, but had reason to\r\n believe it very great. That if my agents were permitted to go, such\r\n need as they found they would be prompt to relieve. On the other hand,\r\n if they did not find the need existing there, none would leave the\r\n field so gladly as they. There would be no respecting of persons;\r\n humanity alone would be their guide. “We have,” I added, “brought\r\n only ourselves, no correspondent has accompanied us, and we shall\r\n have none, and shall not go home to write a book on Turkey. We are\r\n not here for that. Nothing shall be done in any concealed manner. All\r\n dispatches which we send will go openly through your own telegraph,\r\n and I should be glad if all that we shall write could be seen by your\r\n Government. I cannot, of course, say what its character will be, but\r\n can vouch for its truth, fairness, and integrity, and for the conduct\r\n of every leading man who shall be sent. I shall never counsel nor\r\n permit a sly or underhand action with your Government, and you will\r\n pardon me, Pasha, if I say that I shall expect the same treatment in\r\n return--such as I give I shall expect to receive.”\r\n\r\n Almost without a breath he replied--“And you shall have it. We\r\n honor your position and your wishes will be respected. Such aid and\r\n protection as we are able to, we shall render.”\r\n\r\n I then asked if it were necessary for me to see other officials. “No,”\r\n he replied, “I speak for my Government.” And with cordial good wishes,\r\n our interview closed.\r\n\r\n I never spoke personally with this gentleman again; all further\r\n business being officially transacted through the officers of our\r\n Legation. Yet I can truly say, as I have said of my first meeting\r\n with our matchless band of missionary workers, that here commenced an\r\n acquaintance which proved invaluable, and here were given pledges of\r\n mutual faith of which not a word was ever broken or invalidated on\r\n either side, and to which I owe what we were able to do through all\r\n Asia Minor. It is to the strong escorts ordered from the Sublime Porte\r\n for our expeditions and men that I owe the fact that they all came\r\n back to me, and that I bring them home to you, tired and worn, but\r\n saved and useful still.\r\n\r\n Dr. Hubbell and the leaders of the five expeditions tell us that\r\n they were never, even for a portion of a day, without an escort\r\n for protection, and this at the expense of the Turkish Government,\r\n and that without this protection they must not and could not have\r\n proceeded.\r\n\r\n At length the task was accomplished. One by one the expeditions closed\r\n and withdrew, returning by Sivas and Samsoun and coming out by the\r\n Black Sea. By that time it is probable that no one questioned the\r\n propriety of their route or longer wondered at their method of work.\r\n The perplexed frowns of our anxious committees and sympathetic people\r\n had long given way to smiles of confidence and approval, and glad\r\n hands would have reached far over the waters to meet ours as warmly\r\n extended to them.\r\n\r\n With the return of the expeditions we closed the field, but before\r\n leaving Constantinople, funds from both the New York and Boston\r\n committees came to us amounting to some fifteen thousand dollars.\r\n This was happily placed with Mr. Peet, treasurer of the Board of\r\n Foreign Missions at Stamboul, for the building of little houses in\r\n the interior as a winter shelter and protection where all had been\r\n destroyed.\r\n\r\n The appearance of our men on their arrival at Constantinople confirmed\r\n the impression that they had not been recalled too soon. They had gone\r\n out through the snows and ice of winter and without change or rest\r\n had come back through the scorching suns of midsummer--five months\r\n of rough, uncivilized life, faring and sharing with their beasts of\r\n burden, well-nigh out of communication with the civilized world, but\r\n never out of danger, it seemed but just to themselves and to others\r\n who might yet need them that change and rest be given them.\r\n\r\n Since our entrance upon Turkish soil no general disturbance had taken\r\n place. One heard only the low rumbling of the thunder after the\r\n storm, the clouds were drifting southward and settling over Crete and\r\n Macedonia, and we felt that we might take at least some steps toward\r\n home. It was only when this movement commenced that we began truly to\r\n realize how deep the roots of friendship, comradeship, confidence, and\r\n love had struck back among our newly found friends and countrymen;\r\n how much a part of ourselves--educational, humanitarian, and\r\n official--their work and interest had become, and surely from them we\r\n learned anew the lesson of reciprocity.\r\n\r\n Some days of physical rest were needful for the men of the expeditions\r\n after reaching Constantinople before commencing another journey of\r\n thousands of miles, worn as they were by exposure, hardship, and\r\n incessant labor, both physical and mental. This interval of time was,\r\n however, mainly employed by them in the preparation of the reports\r\n submitted with this, and in attention to the letters which followed\r\n them from their various fields, telling of further need, but more\r\n largely overflowing with gratitude and blessing for what had been done.\r\n\r\n For our financial secretary and myself there could be neither rest nor\r\n respite while we remained at a disbursing post so well known as ours.\r\n Indeed there never had been. From the time of our arrival in February\r\n to our embarkation in August there were but two days not strictly\r\n devoted to business, the 4th of July and the 5th of August--the last a\r\n farewell to our friends. For both of these occasions we were indebted\r\n to the hospitality of treasurer and Mrs. W. W. Peet, and although\r\n held in the open air, on the crowning point of Proti, one of the\r\n Princes’ Islands, with the Marmora, Bosporus, and Golden Horn in full\r\n view, the spires and minarets of Constantinople and Scutari telling\r\n us of a land we knew little of, with peoples and customs strange and\r\n incomprehensible to us, still there was no lack of the emblem that\r\n makes every American at home, and its wavy folds of red, white, and\r\n blue shaded the tables and flecked the tasteful viands around which\r\n sat the renowned leaders of the American missionary element of Asia\r\n Minor.\r\n\r\n Henry O. Dwight, D.D., the accomplished gentleman and diplomatic head,\r\n who was the first to suggest an appeal to the Red Cross, and I am\r\n glad to feel he has never repented him of his decision. One fact in\r\n regard to Dr. Dwight may be of interest to some hundreds of thousands\r\n of our people. On first meeting him I was not quite sure of the title\r\n by which to address him, if reverend or doctor, and took the courage\r\n to ask him. He turned a glance full of amused meaning upon me as he\r\n replied: “That is of little consequence; the title I prize most is\r\n _Captain_ Dwight.” “Of what?” I asked. “Company D, Twentieth Ohio\r\n Volunteers, in our late war.” The recognition which followed can\r\n well be imagined by the comrades for whose interest I have named the\r\n incident.\r\n\r\n The Reverend Joseph K. Greene, D.D., and his amiable wife, to whom\r\n so much is due toward the well-being of the missionary work of\r\n Constantinople. I regret that I am not able to reproduce the eloquent\r\n and patriotic remarks of Dr. Greene on both these occasions, so true\r\n to our country, our government, and our laws. The Reverend George P.\r\n Knapp, formerly of Bitlis, whose courage no one questions. Mrs. Lee\r\n of Marash, and Mrs. Dr. George Washburn of Robert College, the worthy\r\n and efficient daughters of the Reverend Doctor Cyrus Hamlin, the\r\n veteran missionary and founder of Robert College, living in Lexington,\r\n Massachusetts. A half-score of teachers, whose grand lives will one\r\n day grace the pages of religious history. And last, though by no means\r\n least, our host, the man of few words and much work, who bears the\r\n burden of monetary relief for the woes and wants of Asia Minor, W. W.\r\n Peet.\r\n\r\n It was a great satisfaction that most of our field agents were able\r\n to be present at the last of these beautiful occasions and personally\r\n render an account of their stewardship to those who had watched\r\n their course with such interest. The pleasure of these two days of\r\n recreation will ever remain a golden light in our memories.\r\n\r\n As the first official act of the relief work after our arrival in\r\n Constantinople was my formal presentation to the Sublime Porte by the\r\n American Minister, the Honorable A. W. Terrell, diplomatic courtesy\r\n demanded that I take proper occasion to notify the Turkish Government\r\n of our departure and return thanks for its assistance, which was done\r\n formally at “Selamlik,” a religious ceremony held on the Turkish\r\n Sabbath, which corresponds to our Friday. The Court Chamberlain\r\n delivered my message to the palace. It was received and responded to\r\n through the same medium and I took my departure, having finished my\r\n diplomatic work with that Government which had from first to last\r\n treated me with respect, assisted my work, and protected my workers.\r\n\r\n To correct certain impressions and expressions which have been\r\n circulating more or less extensively in this country, and for\r\n the correct information of the people who through their loyal\r\n interest deserve to know the facts, I make known my entire social\r\n relations while residing in Turkey. Personally I did not go beyond\r\n Constantinople. The proper conduct of our work demanded the continuous\r\n presence of both our financial secretary and myself at headquarters.\r\n I never saw, to communicate with personally, any member of the Turkish\r\n Government excepting its Minister of Foreign Affairs, Tewfik Pasha, as\r\n named previously. I never spoke with the Sultan and have never seen\r\n him excepting in his carriage on the way to his mosque.\r\n\r\n On being informed through our Legation that the Turkish Minister at\r\n Washington, Mavroyeni Bey, had been recalled and that his successor\r\n was about to leave for his new position, I felt that national\r\n courtesy required that I call upon him and, attended by a member\r\n of our Legation, my secretary and myself crossed the Bosporusto,\r\n a magnificent estate on the Asiatic shore, the palatial home of\r\n Moustapha Tahsin Bey, a gentleman of culture, who had resided in New\r\n York in some legal capacity, and who, I feel certain, will be socially\r\n and officially acceptable to our Government.\r\n\r\n I have received a decoration, officially described as follows:\r\n\r\n Brevet of Chevalier of the Royal Order of Melusine, founded in\r\n 1186, by Sibylle, Queen and spouse of King Guy of Jerusalem, and\r\n reinstituted several years since by Marie, Princess of Lusignan. The\r\n Order is conferred for humanitarian, scientific and other services\r\n of distinction, but especially when such services are rendered to\r\n the House of Lusignan, and particularly to the Armenian nation. The\r\n Order is worn by a number of reigning sovereigns, and is highly prized\r\n by the recipients because of its rare bestowal and its beauty. This\r\n decoration is bestowed by His Royal Highness, Guy of Lusignan, Prince\r\n of Jerusalem, Cyprus and Armenia.\r\n\r\nSome months after returning home I received through our State\r\nDepartment at Washington the Sultan’s decoration of Shefaket and its\r\naccompanying diploma in Turkish, a translation of which is here given:\r\n\r\n As Miss Barton, American citizen, possesses many great and\r\n distinguished qualities and as recompense is due to her, I am pleased\r\n therefore to accord to her the second class of my decorations of\r\n Shefaket.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch were the honors which Miss Barton received from the Turkish\r\nGovernment. Her American friends in Constantinople were no less\r\nenthusiastic. Among the foremost of American missionaries in Turkey and\r\nthose longest resident in Constantinople, the Reverend Doctors Dwight\r\nand Greene deserve to be quoted as expressing the judgment of the\r\nAmericans as a body:\r\n\r\nFrom the Reverend Doctor H. O. Dwight, one word among the many so\r\ngenerously spoken:\r\n\r\n Miss Barton has done a splendid work, sensibly and economically\r\n managed. Wherever her agents have been, the missionaries have\r\n expressed the strongest approval of their methods and efficiency. The\r\n work done has been of great and permanent importance.\r\n\r\nFrom the Reverend Joseph K. Greene, D.D., to the New York “Independent”:\r\n\r\n After some six months of service, Miss Clara Barton and her five able\r\n assistants have left Constantinople on their return to America. It was\r\n only on the earnest solicitation of the missionaries, the officers of\r\n the American Board, and many other friends of the suffering Armenians\r\n that Miss Barton undertook the relief in this land. The difficulties\r\n of the work, arising from the suspicions of the Turkish authorities,\r\n the distance from the capital to the sufferers, the perils and\r\n discomforts in communicating with them, and from unfamiliarity with\r\n the languages and customs of the people of the land, would surely\r\n have appalled a less courageous heart. Under such circumstances it is\r\n only just and fair that the American public should be apprised of the\r\n substantial success of this mission of the Red Cross.\r\n\r\n In the first place, Miss Barton has shown a rare faculty in getting on\r\n well with everybody. To facilitate her work she, and the assistants\r\n whom she loves to call “my men,” laid aside all the insignia of the\r\n Red Cross and appeared everywhere simply as private individuals.\r\n She clearly understood that she could accomplish her mission only\r\n by securing the confidence and good-will of the authorities, and\r\n this she did by her patience and repeated explanations, and by the\r\n assistance of the American Legation. When the _iradé_, or imperial\r\n decree sanctioning her mission, was delayed, she sent forward her\r\n assistants with only a traveling permit for a part of the way,\r\n trusting, and not in vain, that the local authorities, instructed from\r\n headquarters, would facilitate their way. As a matter of fact, while\r\n Mr. Pullman, her secretary and treasurer, remained at Constantinople\r\n with Miss Barton, her distributing agents, namely, Dr. Hubbell and Mr.\r\n Mason, Mr. Wistar and Mr. Wood, either together or in two parties,\r\n traveled inland from Alexandretta to Killis, Aintab, Marash, Zeitoun,\r\n Birejik, Oorfa, Diarbekir, Farkin, Harpoot, Palou, Malatia, Arabkir,\r\n Egin, Sivas, Tokat, Samsoun, and back to Constantinople without\r\n interruption or molestation. They were readily and constantly supplied\r\n with guards, and could not with safety have made their perilous four\r\n months’ journey without them. Demands are said to have been made that\r\n the distribution of aid be made under the supervision of Government\r\n officials, but, in fact, Miss Barton’s agents knew how to make\r\n their distributions in every place, after careful consultation and\r\n examination, without any interference on the part of the authorities.\r\n\r\n Miss Barton received in all about $116,000, and an unexpended balance\r\n of $15,400 was committed to Mr. Peet, the treasurer of the American\r\n Missions in Turkey, to be held as an emergency fund, subject to Miss\r\n Barton’s orders. No expense has been incurred for Miss Barton or her\r\n agents save for traveling expenses and the wages of interpreters,\r\n and with this exception the entire sum expended has gone to the\r\n actual relief of the sufferers. While the fund committed to the\r\n Anglo-American Committee, of which Mr. Peet is a member--a sum four\r\n to five times the amount committed to Miss Barton--has been expended\r\n through the missionaries, largely to save the hungry from starvation,\r\n the relief through the agents of the Red Cross has for the most part\r\n been wisely devoted to the putting of the poor sufferers on their feet\r\n again, and thus helping them to help themselves. Some five hundred\r\n liras (a lira is $4.40 of _good_ money) were given for the cure and\r\n care of the sick in Marash, Zeitoun, and elsewhere, and some two\r\n thousand liras’ worth of cloths, thread, pins and needles were sent\r\n inland; but many times this amount was expended in providing material\r\n for poor widows; seeds, agricultural implements and oxen for farmers;\r\n tools for blacksmiths and carpenters; and looms for weavers. In some\r\n places Miss Barton’s agents had the pleasure of seeing vegetable\r\n gardens coming forward from seed furnished by the Red Cross, and\r\n village farmers reaping the grain with sickles which the Red Cross had\r\n given. The great want now--a want which the funds of the Red Cross\r\n agents did not permit them to any large extent to meet--is aid to the\r\n poor villagers to help them rebuild their burned and ruined houses,\r\n and thus provide for themselves shelter against the rigors of the\r\n coming winter. The Red Cross agents have, however, gathered a great\r\n stock of information; and passing by the horrors of the massacres\r\n and the awful abuse of girls and women, as unimpeachable witnesses\r\n they can bear testimony to the frightful sufferings and needs of the\r\n people. We most sincerely hope and pray that Miss Barton and the\r\n agents and friends of the Red Cross will not esteem their work in\r\n Turkey done, but knowing now so well just what remains to be done,\r\n and what can be done, will bend every effort to secure further relief\r\n for the widows and orphans of the more than sixty thousand murdered\r\n men--mostly between the ages of eighteen and fifty--whose lives no\r\n earthly arm was outstretched to save.\r\n\r\n While we gratefully bear witness to the wise and indefatigable efforts\r\n of Miss Barton’s _agents_, permit us to add that during her more\r\n than six months’ stay in Constantinople Miss Barton gave _herself_\r\n unremittingly to the work of her mission. She seems to have had no\r\n time for sight-seeing, and not a few of her friends are disposed to\r\n complain that she had no time to accept the invitations of those\r\n who would have been glad to entertain her. The only relaxation she\r\n seems to have given herself was on two occasions--the first, a\r\n Fourth of July picnic with a few American friends, on one of the\r\n Princes’ Islands, and the second, another picnic on the same island,\r\n on Wednesday, August 5, when, with three of her “men,” she met some\r\n twenty American lady teachers and missionaries, in order to bid them a\r\n courteous farewell. The first occasion she unqualifiedly declared to\r\n have been the happiest Fourth of July she had ever had; and inspired\r\n by the occasion, she penned some verses which she kindly read to\r\n her friends on the second gathering, and which we very much wish\r\n she would permit the editor of the “Independent” to publish. On the\r\n second occasion, at Miss Barton’s request, the financial secretary\r\n read his report and Dr. Hubbell and Mr. Wood presented reports of the\r\n work of distribution. We gratefully acknowledged the honor done us\r\n in permitting us to hear these reports; and, remembering our\r\n concern for Miss Barton while preparing for the work of distribution\r\n six months ago, we gladly expressed our joy and congratulations now on\r\n the happy return of her faithful and efficient agents, of whom it may\r\n be truly said that they went and saw and conquered. We rejoiced that\r\n these new friends had come to know so well the American missionaries\r\n in Turkey, and were truly thankful for a mutually happy acquaintance.\r\n We wished Miss Barton and her “men” a hearty welcome on their arrival,\r\n and, now, with all our hearts, we wish them God-speed on their return\r\n home.\r\n\r\nMiss Barton was already much bedecorated before the formation of\r\nthe American Red Cross, but she brought back from Turkey additional\r\nofficial decorations presented to her by the Turkish Government and by\r\nprominent organizations represented by the Armenians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DECORATIONS OF CLARA BARTON\r\n\r\n 1. “Gold Masonic Emblem,” given her by her father and worn by Miss\r\n Clara Barton through the Civil War, 1861-1865.\r\n\r\n 2. “The German official Red Cross Field Badge,” presented by the Grand\r\n Duchess of Baden, and worn by Miss Barton through the Franco-Prussian\r\n War, 1870-1871.\r\n\r\n 3. “The Iron Cross of Germany,” conferred by Emperor William I and\r\n Empress Augusta, 1871, in recognition of Miss Barton’s services for\r\n humanity in the Franco-Prussian War.\r\n\r\n 4. “The Gold Cross of Remembrance,” conferred by the Grand Duke and\r\n Grand Duchess of Baden, 1871.\r\n\r\n 5. “Royal Jewel” (gold-knot brooch), presented by the Grand Duchess\r\n of Baden, 1897.

Russian famine.]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing outline briefly summarizes the work of Miss Barton and of\r\nthe American Red Cross in the years following its official recognition\r\nand preceding the Spanish-American War. It was a glorious record; it\r\ngave to the Red Cross a definition in the mind of America, and a place\r\nin the admiration of the world, such as no philanthropic organization\r\never had attained. It brought to Clara Barton honors which she accepted\r\nwith modesty and quietly laid away while she devoted herself to\r\npreparation for the next field of service.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Red Cross was now a labor that occupied the whole\r\ntwelve months. Her salaried force was small; the expense of\r\nadministration was kept low. She maintained a skeleton organization\r\nwith a stock of supplies such as did not deteriorate by storage and\r\nwas certain to be needed when the first news of disaster arrived. She\r\ndid not employ a large force of idle helpers. She depended upon the\r\nemergency bringing its own troop of assistants who worked under her\r\ndirection and the direction of those whom she had trained.\r\n\r\nClara Barton knew what not all philanthropists know that it is as\r\nimportant for a philanthropic organization to get out when its work\r\nis done as it is for it to go in when its work is needed. In almost\r\nevery field she met with requests for the continuance of the work after\r\nshe knew that the time had come for the people to rely upon their own\r\nresources. She was determined that the Red Cross should never become a\r\npauperizing institution or furnish employment for an army of official\r\nidlers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nCLARA BARTON AT HOME AND ABROAD\r\n\r\n\r\nStrenuous were the years of Miss Barton’s administration of the\r\nAmerican Red Cross. There was upon an average practically one disaster\r\na year which called her organization into the field. In some instances\r\nthe active work of the Red Cross upon the ground lasted only a few\r\nweeks; in other cases, as in the matter of the South Carolina Sea\r\nIslands, it consumed almost a year. The intervals between disasters\r\nwere occupied by correspondence, addresses, articles for the press,\r\nand attendance to the many duties brought on by a widened acquaintance\r\nand a constantly growing interest in the work. They were years, too,\r\nin which Miss Barton was sometimes personally short of money. In no\r\nother period, as in this, do her diaries so clearly show the necessity\r\nwhich she felt for personal economy for the sake of the work. She\r\ndeclined the four-thousand-dollar salary which was suggested for her;\r\nshe vetoed every proposal looking toward a Government appropriation for\r\nher personal benefit or for the work of the Red Cross. If during this\r\nlong period she ever thought of the Red Cross in terms of a possible\r\nfinancial advantage to herself, her diaries betray no hint of it. If\r\nshe ever thought of the possibility that Congress might take care of\r\nher, the innumerable letters which passed between her and the members\r\nof the two houses of Congress afford no indication of it.\r\n\r\nThe adhesion of the United States to the Treaty of Geneva did,\r\nhowever, take her abroad a number of times, once or more at Government\r\nexpense, as one of the three official representatives of the United\r\nStates at certain international congresses. The appropriations to\r\ncover the expenses of a delegate were never very large; generally two\r\nthousand dollars for the expense of three delegates. In connection\r\nwith one of these journeys an interesting correspondence developed in\r\nwhich one of the delegates exceeded in expenditure his none too ample\r\nallowance of less than seven hundred dollars. He wrote a long letter\r\nexplaining why it had been necessary for him to expend more, and\r\ndesired Clara Barton to approve his request for an increase. This she\r\ndeclined to do either for herself or for either of the others. For her\r\nsimple tastes the appropriation was ample; she lived within it and her\r\nassociates had to do the same or make up the balance out of their own\r\npockets.\r\n\r\nMiss Barton had just returned from her arduous labor on behalf of the\r\nflood sufferers on the Ohio and Mississippi in the summer of 1884,\r\nwhen Secretary of State Frelinghuysen appointed her one of the three\r\ndelegates to the International Conference at Geneva. Her associates\r\nwere her friends Judge Joseph Sheldon, of Connecticut, and Mr. A. S.\r\nSullivan, vice-president of the American Red Cross.\r\n\r\nMiss Barton was so wearied with her labors in connection with the flood\r\nsufferers that she hesitated about accepting her appointment. To her\r\ngreat joy and to that of Dr. Hubbell, who accompanied her, the voyage\r\nproved an excellent tonic. There was not an unpleasant day, and Miss\r\nBarton was not ill an hour and did not miss a meal. Toward the close\r\nof the voyage she was called upon to address the passengers, who\r\ngreeted her with great interest and listened to her with marked and\r\nreverent attention. She reached Liverpool on August 26, 1884, and had a\r\nhappy and prosperous journey to Geneva where the Congress convened in\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\nFour hundred distinguished delegates and representatives of the\r\nsignatory powers to the treaty assembled at Geneva. There were titled\r\nrulers, distinguished representatives of nobility, eminent surgeons,\r\nnoted scientists, and philanthropists whose names were known around the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to say that Clara Barton was the most noted delegate\r\nto that convention and the recipient of its highest honors. There was\r\nnot one among the four hundred delegates who did not know that it was\r\nshe who brought the United States, last of all the great nations, to\r\noccupy a place in that gathering. Popular interest centered about her;\r\nshe was pointed out and sought out as the most celebrated delegate to\r\nthe congress. Not all of her associates were strangers to her; chief\r\namong the royal persons present to claim the honor of her acquaintance\r\nand introduce her as their friend were the Grand Duke of Baden, the\r\nGrand Duchess, and her imperial father, the Emperor of Germany.\r\n\r\nIt was the direct influence of Miss Barton which caused the\r\nintroduction of what is known as the “America Amendment.” This\r\namendment was to the effect--\r\n\r\n That the Red Cross Society engage in time of peace in humanitarian\r\n work analogous to the duties devolving upon them in periods of war,\r\n such as taking care of the sick and rendering relief in extraordinary\r\n calamities where, as in war, prompt and organized relief is demanded.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of this resolution was a high compliment to Clara Barton.\r\nShe brought to the congress not only the prestige of America’s\r\naccession to the treaty, but a new and notable enlargement of the\r\nsphere of Red Cross activity which she had invented, tested, and found\r\npracticable in America, and worthy of recommendation to all the world.\r\n\r\nAt Geneva she was joined by Antoinette Margot, whom she sent for as\r\na companion and interpreter. For, though Clara Barton was fairly at\r\nhome in conversation in French, she was glad of assistance at times.\r\nAntoinette had written her in the years of their separation. Her own\r\nlife had been none too happy, and she had passed through a religious\r\ncrisis that led her, though born a Protestant, into the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch, and later into a cloister. Even this change she credited to\r\nClara Barton! This amused Clara, but Antoinette said that but for Clara\r\nshe would have remained “a crushed-down little unhappy baby in my\r\nfather’s house”; Clara had given her courage and strength to face great\r\nquestions and decide them:\r\n\r\n Dear, dear Miss Barton [she wrote]: Never, never I shall forget what\r\n I owe to you. I owe you even my perfect actual happiness of being\r\n a Catholic, for, without your strong teaching, and your nerving of\r\n my heart, I could never have dared to take the step of following my\r\n convictions, when I had convictions to follow.\r\n\r\nClara’s comment was:\r\n\r\n Poor, simple child! It is all for the best, I think. Hers is one of\r\n those unsteady, unbalanced minds that must be controlled. She has no\r\n mastery over herself, and nothing but a priest and a confessional can\r\n make her happy.\r\n\r\nAntoinette poured out her impulsive love in extravagant protestations\r\nof devotion. She wanted to see Miss Barton, to kiss the feet of the\r\nwoman who had done so much for her, and who stood in the mind of\r\nAntoinette as the realization of the noblest ideal of womanhood.\r\n\r\nWe owe to this impulsive girl, who later entered a convent, a really\r\nfine description of Clara Barton as she stood among the representatives\r\nof all the nations that were joined in the league of the Red Cross at\r\nGeneva:\r\n\r\n The Government of the United States has done itself no greater credit\r\n than in selecting Clara Barton to represent it among the nations\r\n abroad. During the last week I have looked on as she has sat day by\r\n day in one of the greatest and grandest assemblies of men that could\r\n be gathered--men representing the highest rank among the civilized\r\n nations of the earth; men of thought, of wisdom, of power, called\r\n together from all over the world to deliberate on great questions, of\r\n nautical import, military power, the neutrality of nations, humanity\r\n in war, wisdom in peace. In the midst of this assembly of gray-haired\r\n men, glittering with military decorations, with national honors, won\r\n and conferred, sat this one woman--calm, thoughtful, self-possessed,\r\n recognized and acknowledged as possessing every right and privilege\r\n belonging to any member of the conference; not merely permitted to be\r\n there, but there by the sovereign right of nations; not merely allowed\r\n to sit there by the courtesy due to a lady, but by the right due to a\r\n nation’s representative; her vote not merely accepted as a matter of\r\n form, but expected and watched for; grave questions referred to her\r\n as the representative of a great nation, and all deference paid to\r\n her judgment: her demeanor so unobtrusive, her actions so wise, that\r\n it could not otherwise than reflect merited credit upon her and her\r\n country.\r\n\r\n But the crowning recognition of her philanthropic labors at home and\r\n abroad was given when one of the Italian delegates, springing upon the\r\n platform, proposed to the assemblage to vote, by acclamation, that\r\n “_Mademoiselle Barton bien mérite de l’humanité_”.\r\n\r\n Even Miss Barton was moved from her usual composure by the thunders\r\n of applause. I do not know whether you in America are familiar with\r\n the peculiar significance of that phrase. It is an expression of the\r\n highest approbation, honor, and esteem that the French language can\r\n convey. It is probable that Miss Barton is the first woman in the\r\n world who has ever received such a tribute.\r\n\r\nAfter her return from Geneva, Miss Barton made a journey to California,\r\nin 1886, returning by way of Charleston, South Carolina, where she had\r\na share in the relief of that city after the earthquake.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1887, occurred another international congress of the Red\r\nCross. This was held in Germany, at Carlsruhe, the ducal capital of\r\nAlsace and home of the Grand Duchess Louise. Here she met her friends,\r\nthe Grand Duke and Duchess of Baden and the Emperor of Germany, and\r\nbesides these the Empress Augusta, Bismarck, and von Moltke. Her honors\r\nhere were scarcely less brilliant than they had been at Geneva, and her\r\npersonal joys were more, for she was near the scenes of her labors in\r\nthe Franco-Prussian War. There she was the guest of royalty; crowned\r\nheads bowed respectfully to her. From Baden Baden she wrote a letter\r\nhome just after the close of the congress:\r\n\r\n  BADEN BADEN, GERMANY, Oct. 28, 1887\r\n\r\n The International Red Cross Conference has closed. Most of the\r\n delegates have left Carlsruhe, unless, like ourselves, remaining\r\n for after-work. The Grand Duke and Grand Duchess, with their Court,\r\n have retired to Baden Baden for the customary birthday festivities\r\n of Her Majesty the Empress, and the Emperor and his suite would, as\r\n also customary, make his yearly visit in honor of the occasion, thus\r\n making that lovely and historic old town for the moment, the center of\r\n interest for the Empire.\r\n\r\n Dr. H. and myself were at breakfast when the hotel porter laid a\r\n telegraphic dispatch on my plate. It will be remembered, at least\r\n by personal friends, that three years ago, while in attendance at a\r\n similar international conference, the honored pleasure of a meeting\r\n with His Majesty the Emperor of Germany had been given me. This\r\n dispatch informed me that a like honor again awaited my presence in\r\n Baden Baden. Trunks were packed, adieus made, and the midday train of\r\n the following day took us in time for the appointed hour. Whoever has\r\n visited the interior of the “New Castle,” the Baden Baden palace of\r\n the Grand Duke, and been shown through its tasteful apartments, rich\r\n in elegance, tradition, and history, will require no further reminder\r\n of the _place_ where the interview would be given.\r\n\r\n This was, as well, the birthday of the Crown Prince; and in tender\r\n paternal sympathy, for the painful affliction resting upon a life so\r\n treasured, and for the great anxiety of the German people, His Majesty\r\n the Emperor would pass a portion of the day with the beloved daughter\r\n and sister, the Grand Duchess, at the castle; and in honoring memory\r\n of the occasion, its halls were thronged with visitors who came to\r\n manifest both respect and sympathy.\r\n\r\n At half-past one o’clock we were ushered in at the great castle\r\n doors, by their attendants in livery of “scarlet and gold,” the\r\n national colors of Baden; our damp wraps removed--for it was a\r\n pouring rain--and after a half-hour sitting by a cheerful fire, among\r\n pictures which quite called one out of personal consciousness, we were\r\n escorted to the grand reception and drawing room, to the center of a\r\n magnificent apartment with no occupant but ourselves. By another door\r\n one saw the Emperor surrounded by guests, who paid formal respects.\r\n Scores of visitors with coachmen in richest livery had entered while\r\n we waited and registered titled names on the open pages.\r\n\r\n At length His Majesty turned from the group about him, and, taking\r\n the arm of the Grand Duchess, entered our apartment. It was difficult\r\n to realize all the ninety years, as he stepped toward us with even,\r\n and steady, if no longer elastic, tread. He approached with cordially\r\n extended hand, and in his excellent French expressed satisfaction for\r\n the meeting. “In the name of humanity, he was glad to meet and welcome\r\n those who labored for it.”\r\n\r\n In recalling the earlier days of our acquaintance, Her Royal Highness\r\n the Grand Duchess alluded tenderly to the winter in Strassburg of\r\n ’70 and ’71,--which I had passed among its poor and wounded people\r\n after the siege,--and, selecting two from a cluster of decorations\r\n which I had worn in honor of the present occasion, drew the attention\r\n of the Emperor to them. The one he knew; it was his own, presented\r\n upon his seventy-fifth birthday. The other he had never seen. It was\r\n the beautiful decoration of the “German Waffengenossen”--the “Warrior\r\n Brothers in arms” of Milwaukee.\r\n\r\n It was puzzlingly familiar, and yet it was not familiar. There was\r\n again the Iron Cross of Germany, but it was on the American shield.\r\n The “American Eagle” surmounting the arms for defense; and the colors\r\n of Germany, the red, white, and black of the Empire uniting the two.\r\n His Majesty gazed upon the expressive emblem, which, with no words,\r\n said so much, and turned inquiringly to the Grand Duchess, as if to\r\n ask, “Does my daughter understand this?”\r\n\r\n The explanation was made that it was from His Majesty’s own soldiers,\r\n who, after the “German-Franco War,” had gone to the United States and\r\n become citizens; and this device was designed to express, that, as by\r\n its shield they were American citizens, and true to the land of their\r\n adoption, so by its “Iron Cross,” they were still German; and by the\r\n colors of the native land for which every man had offered his life,\r\n and risked it, they bound the old home to the new; and by the American\r\n Eagle and arms, surmounting all, they were ready to offer their lives\r\n again, if need be, in defense of either land.\r\n\r\n The smile of the grand old Emperor, as he listened, had in it the\r\n “Well done” of the benignant father to a dutiful and successful son.\r\n “And they make good citizens?” he would ask. “The best that could be\r\n desired,” I said; “industrious, honest, and prosperous, and, sire,\r\n they are still yours in heart, still true to the Fatherland and its\r\n Emperor.”\r\n\r\n “I am glad to hear this; they were good soldiers, and thank God, true\r\n men everywhere,” was the earnest and royal response.\r\n\r\n His Majesty continued, speaking of America, its growth, its progress,\r\n its advancement in science and humanity, its adoption and work of the\r\n Red Cross, which meant so much for mankind; and when assured that its\r\n people revered and loved the Emperor of Germany, that his life was\r\n precious to them, and that thousands of prayers went up for him in\r\n that distant land he had never seen, the touching and characteristic\r\n response betrayed the first tremor of the voice the ear had caught in\r\n its kindly tones.\r\n\r\n “God be praised for this; for it is all from Him. I am only His. Of\r\n myself I am nothing. He made us what we are. God is over all.”\r\n\r\n We stood with bowed heads while those slowly spoken, earnest, holy\r\n words from that most revered of earthly monarchs fell upon us like a\r\n benediction.\r\n\r\n At length His Majesty gave a hand to both Dr. H. and myself in a\r\n parting adieu, and walked a few steps away, when turning back, and\r\n again extending a hand, said, in French, “It is probably the last\r\n time,” and in pleasant English, “Good-bye.” And again taking the arm\r\n of the Grand Duchess walked from the room, leaving His Highness the\r\n Grand Duke, one of the kindest and noblest types of manhood, to say\r\n the last words, and close the interview; one of the most impressive\r\n and memorable of a lifetime.\r\n\r\nIn another letter she told of her parting with the imperial party as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  BADEN BADEN, Oct. 24, 1887\r\n\r\n I do not know if I have written since coming here or if my last was\r\n from Carlsruhe. We were here for the “Baden season.” We were invited\r\n by the Duke and Duchess to spend a few weeks at Baden Baden, and of\r\n course all the Court proper would come. The Empress came also; and\r\n the Emperor. They will be here till next Friday, when she goes to\r\n Berlin. The Crown Prince’s health is very poor. The Emperor is better\r\n than ever--bright and cheerful like a young man. We went the other\r\n evening to see him take the train for Berlin. The station reserve\r\n rooms were like a drawing-room and all the Court and royal persons\r\n were in them, to wait the coming of the Emperor, and the town. The\r\n Emperor shook hands with all, saying good-bye, made pretty gifts to\r\n some special persons, then entered the royal train, to ride all night.\r\n The day before yesterday the Empress sent for me to come to her. I\r\n spent a most delightful hour. She had a great deal to say, and made me\r\n a lovely parting gift of a ruby brooch. She insisted that we should\r\n meet again, that I should come to Europe again, and she should see\r\n me. In the P.M. the Grand Duchess sent for us to go to her and we\r\n went and spent two lovely hours. She is charming as ever. Then next\r\n evening (last evening) she sent for us to come to dine. We went and\r\n had a beautiful time. We are to go again to-morrow for a visit. After\r\n the end of this week we go to Strassburg to spend a little time. Shall\r\n most likely go to Berlin and back to Strassburg and down the French\r\n side of the Rhine to Basle, Bern, Geneva, Paris, London, Liverpool,\r\n and then we shall be on our direct way home, but it is some little\r\n time yet before we can go home.\r\n\r\nFrom her journey to attend that international congress at Carlsruhe\r\nshe returned in January, 1888, and was quickly called away to Mount\r\nVernon, Illinois, to care for the sufferers from the tornado. When\r\nshe returned from this campaign, she went on a short tour delivering\r\naddresses before influential bodies. She spoke in Montclair, New\r\nJersey, addressing a State conference of Congregational churches. She\r\nthen delivered a lecture in Philadelphia, and was received with every\r\nconsideration and honor. Then she went home to Washington and did her\r\nwashing. This combination of her work as a world leader and a woman\r\nconcerned with domestic affairs is contained in two letters to Mrs.\r\nStafford, dated May 4 and May 8, 1888:\r\n\r\n  DEAREST MAMIE:\r\n\r\n I had intended to write you just a line on the train to and from\r\n Philadelphia, but one was in the night--the other so full of other\r\n things and the trip so short, I did not get to it.\r\n\r\n I can’t think it was a week ago, but so it seems. The first day I\r\n met the Society on its Annual Meeting, and spoke to them a little.\r\n I attended a lunch party before the meeting and a reception after\r\n the opera at the elegant residence of Dr. ----, president of the\r\n Philadelphia Red Cross. That made four things after twelve o’clock.\r\n\r\n The next day we had informal meetings with officers of the society\r\n until two o’clock P.M. Then attended a lecture given in the regular\r\n course of the Red Cross Society. Then I gave a lecture. Then home to\r\n dress for the reception to commence at eight.\r\n\r\n This was given in Union League Hall, very large, with a band of music.\r\n The dignitaries of the city attended in bodies. The physicians--the\r\n clergymen--the lawyers--the judges--the military army and navy in\r\n uniform. I received and shook hands with all. They left after eleven.\r\n It was a splendid reception. There was still a meeting at the hotel\r\n (The Colonnade) after our return, so we are only in bed by two o’clock\r\n next morning, got a hasty breakfast and hastened to the nine o’clock\r\n train for home; found a large mail, and I was very sleepy. I did sleep\r\n a day or two mainly, and that is what makes the week seem so short, I\r\n think.\r\n\r\n Then just think what a washing there was on hand; had never had time\r\n to have a full wash done since our return from Mount Vernon. The\r\n Woman’s Council came directly on that, and an address to write for\r\n it. Then the conference of churches at Montclair, and another address\r\n to write. Then Philadelphia, and another address to write, with all\r\n that came between. The wash went to the wall till this week, when it\r\n was taken up in its turn and put through in one day, and all ironed\r\n yesterday, and clothes put away this very minute, and I haven’t left\r\n the warehouse yet, but am just dropped down at the table in front\r\n of the window, near the store (Gaby will know all about it) while\r\n Alfred brings compost from the stable alongside ready to make up some\r\n flower-beds, etc., and I direct him from the window as I scribble, to\r\n lose no time. It is just as lovely as it can be. Tell Gaby we have\r\n moved the rosebushes all down to the front of the yard, and they\r\n didn’t mind it a bit, and went right on putting out buds, and he will\r\n appreciate how much better chance we had with a washing of twenty\r\n sheets, thirty pillowslips, and other things in proportion, and he\r\n knows how quickly and easily it all went out of the way, and no one\r\n got much tired, and not any sick.\r\n\r\n I haven’t time for more than a word. We are making out our foreign\r\n conference accounts for the Government and I have the report to make\r\n out directly and a bill to draw up for Congress this next week and a\r\n host of correspondence, and we are having Alfred make up our garden,\r\n in front of the warehouse, and a pretty little plot it is too. I\r\n found time one night by moonlight to plant lettuce and peppergrass\r\n and radishes, and in two days they come up and are green and pretty.\r\n Yesterday we set out two dozen tomato plants a foot high, and all\r\n of our dozen grapevines are growing; splendid varieties; and when\r\n Alfred makes up the flower-beds to-day, we shall find time to plant\r\n all the seeds I have. I have no bulbs to set, but I have a dozen nice\r\n hollyhocks, fifteen inches high, and all the rosebushes and fleur de\r\n lys in bloom and bud. I can’t get time to hunt over the house for the\r\n little seeds we want to plant. I have nice seeds for kitchen-garden\r\n things from Dansville, but can’t remember where to look for them. I\r\n want a pinch of caraway seed and twelve great sage roots and I want\r\n some catnip seed for Tommy. There is not a stalk of catnip anywhere\r\n about, and I can’t get any seed. Have you some in your catnip herb\r\n bag? I like saffran, and red balm such as Julian raises; I can\r\n get plenty of elegant plants, but the old, old things are hard to\r\n find--and I have not time to look, but should so like to stick a few\r\n out in my nice beds. So here is a place for small contributions. I do\r\n hope Johny is better. Please give him all the love I can send, and\r\n try, all of you, to keep well. We are well, the Saturday work is all\r\n done up, and everything is lovely as spring can make it.\r\n\r\n The great “Council of Women” is now over [she writes a little later]:\r\n the meetings are ended, the people are mainly leaving the city, and\r\n this hour my house has had its last visitor. Every day till now my\r\n space, and my table, has been filled to the utmost, and in addition to\r\n my full part in the “Council,” its meeting, committees, and speeches.\r\n\r\n The next morning (yesterday) I had to meet a Senate committee at the\r\n Capitol and address them at ten o’clock. Then I go with Mrs. General\r\n Logan and others to the War Department to manage business there. And\r\n now it is eight-thirty the next morning, and at ten I must be at the\r\n War Department with another committee.\r\n\r\nHer domestic affairs attended to, she hurried to Boston to deliver\r\nan important address and attend a reception. From there she went to\r\nWellesley and delivered an address:\r\n\r\n My cold entirely left me, and I have had no trouble with it. So much\r\n for right living, and good cool blood. This is the last day of the\r\n convention. I am to speak to-night. I did say a little yesterday,\r\n and they all laughed at me; I wish you could have been here. There\r\n is to be a reception given me next Friday evening. Steve and Lizzie\r\n and Myrtie are invited. I go to the Wellesley College to take tea and\r\n speak to the five hundred girls there on Saturday evening. Some things\r\n I must miss. I get back as soon as I can, so as to go on home. I am so\r\n glad of Sunday; it was a glorious day; so good to see so many together\r\n again. I hope the children are well, that you don’t wrestle too much\r\n with imaginary dirt, and are getting a little real strength.\r\n\r\nBesides her tours abroad she had some interesting journeys in her own\r\ncountry, including a happy camping trip in the Yellowstone Park and the\r\nCascade Mountains, in the autumn of 1891.\r\n\r\nThe following winter she spent in the Red Cross Headquarters in what\r\nhad been the home of General Grant in Washington. It was a strenuous\r\nwinter and an expensive one. She drew upon her personal resources for\r\nfuel for the large building, as well as for rent and the care of the\r\nhome. She wrote to Mrs. Bullock:\r\n\r\n  17 EAST F STREET, WASHINGTON\r\n  January 7, 1892\r\n\r\n I have wanted to talk with you about coming to see us, but when I\r\n think how cold it is here, and how far from nice and cozy it is, I\r\n feel reluctant to invite you from a small, snug, pretty home, to this\r\n so large and, as it seems to me, less inviting one. If you did not\r\n know it, I should not dare to say you might try it, for we are having\r\n an exceptionally cold, hard winter. The ground is covered with snow,\r\n and the winds have blown an old northeaster these last days, and you\r\n will know this is not an easy house to heat. My expenses have been\r\n so heavy, and receipts so “nothing,” that I cannot afford to take on\r\n more help. I am obliged to have a woman for the work and the house,\r\n a man for the fires and walk,--shoveling snow and all the cold rough\r\n work,--and an amanuensis as my clerk and typewriter. They are drawing\r\n steadily every month; then my rent is high and no one to help share\r\n that, and, besides this, all the world expects me to give it something\r\n if it can get through the door and get a letter to me. I have had to\r\n economize on myself.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 she was led into an experiment which caused her much anxiety\r\nand proved to have been a mistake. A man and his wife, who had been\r\nassociated with her in her work along the Ohio River, expressed a\r\ndesire to dedicate, as a thank offering to humanity, a tract of land\r\nmore than one square mile in area, or specifically seven hundred\r\nand eighty-two acres, as a home for the American Red Cross. This\r\noffer deeply touched Miss Barton, who accepted it in the following\r\nappreciative letter addressed to the donors:\r\n\r\n  AMERICAN NATIONAL RED CROSS\r\n  WASHINGTON, D.C., March 18, 1893\r\n\r\n DEAR SIR: Referring to your letter of February 10th, made public\r\n February 23d, permit me to reply as follows:\r\n\r\n In accepting the gift of land, in the State of Indiana, that you so\r\n generously dedicate to the American National Red Cross as “the almoner\r\n of humanity,” and by which you have so touchingly complimented me\r\n personally, allow me to say that the friendship expressed on this\r\n and many other occasions by yourself and wife, and the personal aid\r\n you have both given of time and labor in great calamities, make me\r\n free to accept this gift without reservation, assuring you of my best\r\n endeavors to attain the humane results for which this benefaction is\r\n intended.\r\n\r\n This land, as the property of the American National Red Cross, will be\r\n the one piece of neutral ground on the Western Hemisphere protected\r\n by international treaty against the tread of hostile feet. It is a\r\n perpetual sanctuary against invading armies, and will be so respected\r\n and held sacred by the military powers of the world. Forty nations are\r\n pledged to hold all material and stores of the Red Cross, and all its\r\n followers, neutral in war, and free to go and come as their duties\r\n require.\r\n\r\n While its business headquarters will remain, as before, at the capital\r\n of the Nation, this gift still forms a realization of the hope so long\r\n cherished--that the National Red Cross may have a place to accumulate\r\n and produce material and stores for sudden emergencies and great\r\n calamities; and if war should come upon our land, which may God avert,\r\n we may be ready to fulfil the mission that our adhesion to the Geneva\r\n Treaty has made binding upon us.\r\n\r\n I will direct that monuments be erected defining the boundaries of\r\n this domain, dedicated to eternal peace and humanity, upon which shall\r\n be inscribed the insignia of the Treaty of Geneva, which insignia all\r\n the nations of the earth are bound by solemn covenant to respect.\r\n\r\n Not only our own people, but the peoples of all civilized nations will\r\n have published to their knowledge that the American National Red Cross\r\n has a home and a recognized abiding-place through all generations.\r\n\r\n For this I have striven for years, mainly misunderstood, often\r\n misinterpreted, and it is through your clear intuition and humane\r\n thought that the clouds have been swept away and my hopes have been\r\n realized.\r\n\r\n In accordance with views expressed by you in your letter of gift, I\r\n appoint an adviser, which I insist shall be yourself, leaving you\r\n free to appoint another to work jointly with you, knowing that in the\r\n future, as in the past, your heart will be in the work.\r\n\r\n  CLARA BARTON\r\n\r\n  President American National Red Cross\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gift, as it developed, was not without its conditions; the\r\ndonors could not quite afford to give it outright, but would sell\r\nit for a sum very much less than its value in consideration of the\r\nphilanthropic purposes to which it was to be dedicated. This seemed\r\nnot unreasonable, and the deed was accepted subject to the specified\r\nconditions. It seemed to Clara Barton a beautiful achievement; there\r\nwas to be one spot on the Western Hemisphere where in case of war the\r\nrights of humanity would be accepted as supreme. Located as it was in\r\nthe interior of the country, and removed by rail only a few hours\r\nfrom the great cities of Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Louisville,\r\nIndianapolis, and Toledo, and surrounded by fertile farms, it could\r\nbecome in an emergency a vast storehouse of supplies, a great base\r\nhospital for the suffering.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it did not prove to be all that she had anticipated.\r\nThe conditions specified and implied proved to be of such a character\r\nas to render the gift unsuitable for the purposes which she had hoped\r\nto accomplish. The manager into whose hands she committed its care\r\nproved incompetent and, in the end, ungrateful. The gift had to be\r\nrelinquished and the money paid toward it was written down as a total\r\nloss.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 occurred Miss Barton’s experience in Constantinople, where\r\nthe Red Cross had its headquarters during her memorable work for the\r\nArmenians. There she visited Scutari, and gave an address on the scene\r\nof Florence Nightingale’s great work. She returned overland through\r\nVienna, Strassburg, Paris, London, and Liverpool. She left London\r\nOctober 8, 1896. On her return to Washington she was given a great\r\nbanquet attended by some of the most distinguished people in Washington.\r\n\r\nThe following year, 1897, she was appointed by the President to attend\r\nthe International Red Cross Congress in Vienna, Austria.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 she did her notable work in connection with the\r\nSpanish-American War, and for the next two years was fully occupied\r\nwith affairs at home.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 she went abroad again, this time as a delegate to the\r\nconference held in St. Petersburg, the last of the great conferences\r\nwhich she attended. This journey has its record in two letters, one\r\nto her niece, Mrs. Ida Barton Riccius, and the other to her nephew,\r\nStephen E. Barton:\r\n\r\n  _En route_ FROM ST. PETERSBURG\r\n  TO THE GERMAN FRONTIER\r\n  June 18, 1902\r\n\r\n The conference is ended, Russia has been visited, and we are well, and\r\n well on the way toward home. It has been a most fortunate journey, no\r\n accidents, no illness. Attended a great and harmonious conference,\r\n royally met and cared for, with nothing to be regretted.\r\n\r\n We went first to Havre, France, to Paris for a few days, then to\r\n Berlin a few days, then on toward Russia. At the crossing on the\r\n frontier, we were met by a Red Cross escort, and taken on, for\r\n transportation to St. Petersburg, about the 15th of May. Went into\r\n Hôtel de France, where we have remained till yesterday, nearly three\r\n weeks. The conference opened on the 16th with two sittings a day, and\r\n entertainments at evening unless it was necessary to take the day for\r\n some excursion, or visit to some royal entertainment. The conference\r\n lasted about eight days; it was composed of delegates from nearly\r\n fifty nations; subjects of a humanitarian character were discussed\r\n as connected with the work of the Red Cross. In Russia everything is\r\n Red Cross, all hospital work, all emergency work, nearly all relief\r\n work, care of children, orphans, foundlings. The women are educated\r\n to do this work. They enter the schools in the hospitals at eighteen\r\n to twenty, serve one year on probation, two as novices, then they\r\n may receive and wear the Red Cross and be nurses, at a small sum in\r\n money per month, board, clothes, care if sick,--a good home as long\r\n as they live. When too old, or no longer able to work, they have\r\n pensions given them and may remain _in_ the hospital and be cared for\r\n always if they choose, or if they have relatives and _want_ to live\r\n with them they can have their pensions and go to them, and _return_\r\n always if they like. The hospital is _always_ their home, if they want\r\n it, or they may marry if they choose; then they leave. They _seemed_\r\n so happy, looked so healthy; many of them are orphan girls who had\r\n no home; nowhere else _to_ be. They are not Catholic, but of the\r\n Protestant Church of Russia, though _I_ see little difference between\r\n it and the Catholic. The churches are magnificent,--such wealth of\r\n ornamentation. The bishops seem like Catholic priests. The people are\r\n very devout, but still very lively, and _kind_; they seem to me to be\r\n the kindest people I ever saw. All the royal persons look kind; they\r\n have good faces; but the kindest face of all is that of the Czar. He\r\n is young, handsome, looks like a mature college graduate. The Czarina\r\n is also handsome; she was the granddaughter of Queen Victoria; they\r\n have four children, are very fond of them, and of _each other_.\r\n\r\n We went on an excursion to Moscow, saw the city Napoleon went to\r\n capture, and which he found trouble in getting out of. We went to the\r\n Kremlin where he stayed; the rooms he lived in the few days while the\r\n city was burning, and the ways by which he retreated. We visited the\r\n Grand Duke, who is the Governor-General of Moscow, and whose wife\r\n is sister of the Empress, another granddaughter of Victoria, the\r\n daughter of Alice of Hesse, who died many years ago of diphtheria\r\n while nursing three children through it. The Grand Duchess is said\r\n to be the handsomest woman in Russia. I think that may be true, and\r\n after I returned to Petersburg she _sent me her picture_--beautiful!!\r\n Everybody was so kind to us all, but I felt they were especially kind\r\n to me. I never saw such treatment of guests; they wouldn’t _let_ you\r\n spend money. Carriages were at the disposal of all the delegates, all\r\n places of amusement free, guides provided; lunches, like dinners,\r\n provided each day at the conference, a hundred persons fed somewhere,\r\n two or three times a day, and _such_ feeding!! Very many of the\r\n delegates were old friends of mine. I had met them in five other\r\n conferences; they were so genial and attentive.\r\n\r\n As I am going to ask you to let Ada and Mamie read this, and _Harold_,\r\n too, I must tell you about the horses, the finest I have ever seen.\r\n They have two choice kinds, the “black Orlorf,” and the dapple gray,\r\n good size, carriage horses, and they go like the wind. The Orlorf\r\n was brought into St. Petersburg (perhaps into Russia as well) by\r\n Count Orlorf a good many years ago. The males are not changed, kept\r\n as stallions in full strength and spirit, and, when past active or\r\n first-class service, are kept for breeding purposes. They are not\r\n allowed to be _sold_ out of Russia, it is said. They weigh from one\r\n thousand to fourteen hundred pounds, are jet black, have glossy hair,\r\n high arching necks, step as proud as war-horses, with full even\r\n tails, trimmed at the bottom to keep them from touching the ground.\r\n The Russian harness is not half the weight of ours, and much less of\r\n it; the shafts are kept away from the body, and _all_ horses are round\r\n and fat. I have not seen a poor horse in Russia. The grays are much\r\n like the black, only dappled, as if painted, so dark, and distinct\r\n dapples, with also the heavy beautiful tails. I asked to go through\r\n the Royal stalls--the Czar has eight hundred horses in his stud; a\r\n part are in Peterhof, ten miles away. The horses were in stalls about\r\n two thirds as wide, big stalls as Baba’s, say six to seven feet,\r\n with wooden floors, a narrow crack running the whole length to keep\r\n them dry, half a foot of clean dry straw in each, a little manger\r\n for grain, a little wire rack for hay, a good blanket on each, and\r\n you have the entire outfit of this beautiful “stud of Royal horses.”\r\n They were gentle and didn’t mind a strange hand on them, and the\r\n gentlemanly uniformed groom encouraged it, and smiled at their quiet,\r\n good behaviour. Some of the carriages are for two, some four, and\r\n some eight horses. The gilded and gemmed carriages are especially for\r\n Coronation occasions, some of them one hundred and fifty years old,\r\n bright and beautiful as yesterday. Ordinarily the Royal people ride in\r\n common carriages and drive a great deal, to hospitals, to all houses\r\n of charity, schools, orphanages, and churches. They are the patrons of\r\n all these, and give great sums to them.\r\n\r\n The Empress has schools of hundreds of young women and young ladies\r\n in St. Petersburg studying from the lowest to the highest branches,\r\n art and literature, which she visits every week; they are fitting\r\n themselves, not alone for society, but to go all over Russia to teach.\r\n The Russians have all the societies we have, “Prevention of Cruelty\r\n to Animals,” which they don’t seem to need as much as we do. I might\r\n except temperance societies, which they do not have, and probably need\r\n about _as_ much as we, only the Russian doesn’t fight and quarrel when\r\n he gets drunk; he goes to sleep.\r\n\r\n Have I told you that there is no real night in northern Russia at this\r\n season of the year? Ask Saidee to trace it on her atlas and she will\r\n find that St. Petersburg is in the _same_ latitude of the southern\r\n ends of Alaska and Greenland, consequently they have long days and\r\n short nights in summer, and long nights and short days in winter; it\r\n being summer now, we have no real night. The twilight lasted till\r\n eleven-thirty sure, and the sun rose at two-thirty. I went to bed by\r\n daylight, either at one end or the other of the day. I wrote without\r\n a lamp at eleven o’clock at night. The people are in the streets all\r\n night, but there is no disturbance, no one is hurt or attacked. The\r\n police are always on duty, not in the saloons, waiting to be called\r\n to some disturbance, but in the middle of the street, to _see that\r\n there is no disturbance_, and there is none; no people are killed in\r\n dark alleys here. The would-be killer would be killed first, unless he\r\n threw a bomb, and then he would be killed after.\r\n\r\n This is an unmercifully long letter. I wish you would let it go to Ada\r\n and Mamie. If I had a typewriter I would duplicate it, and send to\r\n each, but I have none, and write all by hand. I will take this on to\r\n Berlin to post, where we shall arrive at ten to-morrow morning, for a\r\n few days’ stay.\r\n\r\n With greatest love to all,\r\n\r\n  Your always loving\r\n  CLARA\r\n\r\n This is my “howdy” to all the loved ones, from Europe.\r\n\r\n  HÔTEL SCRIBE, RUE SCRIBE\r\n  PARIS, July 26, 1902\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR STEVE:\r\n\r\n This is Saturday, and I sail to-morrow. I did not intend to write you\r\n in time for you to receive it, and perhaps feel that you must fly\r\n around to meet me in New York. I only wanted to tell you _that_--and\r\n _when_ I would sail so you could calculate in what country I should\r\n most likely be. I go to Boulogne to-morrow, Sunday morning, July 27th,\r\n to catch the S.S. _Pennsylvania_ as she steams on for New York. I\r\n expect to find Mr. Tillinghast on board, as he has arranged to finish\r\n his month’s tour of southern Europe in time to take the _Pennsylvania_\r\n at Hamburg. Boulogne is her last point of land, and any one knowing me\r\n would conclude I would stick to the _land_ as long as possible.\r\n\r\n We had a glorious conference, and were gloriously received, no\r\n kindness or courtesy, and sometimes it seemed as if no luxury, was\r\n omitted. There were no errors, and perfect harmony prevailed. We went\r\n on an excursion to Moscow for three days, returned to Petersburg,\r\n finished all up, did nothing carelessly, nor in too great haste;\r\n wrote my report of the conference, some twenty pages, sent it to\r\n President Roosevelt; made out all my accounts with the Government\r\n ready to present on my return; and when all was finished, left with\r\n Mr. Tillinghast, who took the place of secretary, for Berlin; remained\r\n a week, when Mr. Tillinghast started on his journey of sight-seeing.\r\n The other delegates had long gone, and I made for Carlsruhe for a\r\n stay of two weeks. My time was divided between the Grand Duchess and\r\n Princess Salm Salm, who, at present, resides there. The Salm Salm\r\n was one of the old high houses of Germany, and greatly venerated for\r\n patriotic and noble qualities. The husband of the Princess you will\r\n remember historically, perhaps. Prince Felix left Germany to fight in\r\n _our_ war; raised a regiment, became its colonel, till the close, then\r\n followed Maximilian to Mexico, stayed by him, with the Princess, till\r\n he was shot, then returned to Germany to his estates at Gravelotte.\r\n Not a bad record!\r\n\r\n I remained at Carlsruhe till the “close of the Court Season,” was\r\n present by invitation at the closing of the Parliament, heard the\r\n Grand Duke deliver his splendid address, spent the evening after\r\n socially, and alone, with the Grand Duke and Duchess, till eleven\r\n o’clock. At two they started for the _mountains_, the Princess two\r\n days later; and between them I slipped off to Strassburg, then to\r\n Geneva, then _via_ Strassburg again to Paris, to wait for my steamer.\r\n The _Pennsylvania_ is not a quick but is a steady-going sailer, and\r\n will, D.V., get us over in about eight days, when I will quietly slip\r\n down home, as if I had never been away. No mistakes have been made, no\r\n bad luck, not a day’s illness of any one that I know of. Well enough\r\n managed, it seems to me, and fortunately ended, if it does end well\r\n the rest of the way.\r\n\r\n I didn’t intend to write so much. What you haven’t time to read you\r\n can put in your pocket. Love to all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nCLARA BARTON IN CUBA\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many years before the outbreak of the war with Spain, Clara Barton\r\nhad been interested in the situation in Cuba. In a letter written from\r\nWashington, February 8, 1874, twenty-four years before the outbreak of\r\nthe war with Spain, she said:\r\n\r\n Spain is still fighting her only or almost sole remaining colony,\r\n Cuba. Spain had once immense colonies, but she has been so tyrannical\r\n and so careless of their welfare that she has lost nearly all. And\r\n Cuba, you know, “has an insurgent army,” of so-called rebels fighting\r\n for their freedom. If she ever gets free, she must come to the\r\n United States, as she is too small to stand alone against the greed\r\n of great powers which will try to gobble her up for her riches in\r\n soil and products. The Spanish authorities have just published a new\r\n list of orders, very stringent, and they hope to crush out the Cuban\r\n insurrection in six months. You must keep watch of that, too, and see\r\n how it ends. It will be history by and by to whom Cuba belongs, and,\r\n while one has to study so hard to learn past history, it is not worth\r\n the while to let slip that which all the time is making in our own day\r\n and generation. Comprenez vous?\r\n\r\nHer forecast of events proved to be reliable. The relations between\r\nSpain and Cuba grew more and more strained. A part of the Spanish\r\npolicy for stamping out the rebellion in Cuba was the concentration\r\nof that portion of the civilian population believed to be hostile to\r\nthe Spanish Government, in concentration camps, from which the cry\r\nof distress was continuous. Sympathy in America grew more and more\r\npronounced, but for a long time there appeared no way in which the\r\nUnited States could offer relief. The difficulties of the situation\r\nwere the greater because the Spanish Government believed, with some\r\nreason, that a considerable part of the American sentiment favorable\r\nto relief in Cuba was intermixed with political designs. There were,\r\nindeed, two groups of people demanding relief for Cuba. Clara Barton\r\nthus describes them:\r\n\r\n They might have properly been classed under two distinct heads. The\r\n one, merely the friends of humanity in its simple sense; the other,\r\n friends of humanity also, but what seemed to them a broader and deeper\r\n sense, far more complex. They sought to remove a cause as well as an\r\n effect, and the muffled cry of “Cuba Libre” became their watchword.\r\n Naturally, any general movement by the people in favor of the former\r\n must have the effect to diminish the contributions of the latter,\r\n too small at best for their purpose, and must be wisely discouraged.\r\n Thus, whenever an unsuspecting movement was set on foot by some\r\n good-hearted, unsophisticated body of people, and began to gain\r\n favor with the public and the press, immediately would appear most\r\n convincing counter-paragraphs to the effect that it would be useless\r\n to send relief, especially by the Red Cross:\r\n\r\n First, it would not be permitted to land.\r\n\r\n Next, whatever it took would be either seized outright, or “wheedled”\r\n out of hand by the Spanish authorities in Havana.\r\n\r\n That the Spaniards would be only too glad to have the United States\r\n send food and money for the use of Havana.\r\n\r\n Again, that the Red Cross, being international, would affiliate with\r\n Spain, and ignore the “Cuban Red Cross” already working there and\r\n here. As if poor Cuba, with no national government or treaty-making\r\n power, could have a legitimate Red Cross that other nations could\r\n recognize or work with.\r\n\r\nMiss Barton had but recently returned from Armenia. Her experience with\r\nthe Turkish Government made her keenly aware of all the obstructions\r\nwhich an unsympathetic government can put in the way of philanthropic\r\nrelief. It was useless to attempt any assistance for the sufferers\r\nin Cuba unless Miss Barton had the full approval of the American\r\nGovernment, and in addition the sympathetic coöperation of the Spanish\r\nGovernment. But if she secured the consent of the Government of Spain,\r\nthere was real danger that her work of relief would result less in the\r\nsuccor of the distressed people of Cuba than in the aid and comfort of\r\nthe armies of their oppressors. Spain could not be expected to look\r\nwith favor upon any kind of relief which promised to strengthen the\r\nCuban rebellion. At length, however, the situation grew intolerable;\r\nit became evident that the United States must go into Cuba either with\r\nan army of occupation or an agency for the relief of suffering. As a\r\nmatter of fact, the United States went in both capacities, but the Red\r\nCross went in before the Stars and Stripes. Miss Barton herself has\r\ntold the story of the invasion:\r\n\r\n This state of things continued through the year of 1897, but as the\r\n present year of ’98 opened the reports of suffering that came were not\r\n to be borne quietly, and I decided to confer with our Government and\r\n learn if it had objections to the Red Cross taking steps of its own\r\n in direct touch with the people of the country, and proposing their\r\n coöperation in the work of relief. I beg pardon for the personality of\r\n the statement which follows, but it is history I am asked to write.\r\n\r\n Deciding to refer my inquiry to the Secretary of State, I called at\r\n his department to see him, but learned that he was with the President.\r\n This suiting my purpose, I followed to the Executive Mansion, was\r\n kindly informed that the President and Secretary were engaged on a\r\n very important matter, and had given orders not to be interrupted. As\r\n I turned to leave I was recalled with, “Wait a moment, Miss Barton,\r\n and let me present your card.” Returning immediately, I entered the\r\n President’s room to find these two men in a perplexed study over the\r\n very matter which had called me. Distressed by the reports of the\r\n terrible condition of things so new to us, they were seeking some\r\n remedy, and, producing their notes just taken, revealed the fact that\r\n they had decided to call me into conference.\r\n\r\n The conference was then held. It was decided to form a committee\r\n in New York, to ask money and material of the people at large to\r\n be shipped to Cuba for the relief of the _reconcentrados_ on that\r\n island. The call would be made in the name of the President, and the\r\n committee naturally known as the “President’s Committee for Cuban\r\n Relief.” I was courteously asked if I would go to New York and assume\r\n the oversight of that committee. I declined in favor of Mr. Stephen\r\n E. Barton, second vice-president of the National Red Cross, who, on\r\n being immediately called, accepted; and with Mr. Charles Schieren as\r\n treasurer and Mr. Louis Klopsch, of the “Christian Herald,” as the\r\n third member, the committee was at once established; since known as\r\n the “Central Cuban Relief Committee.”\r\n\r\n The committee was to solicit aid in money and material for the\r\n suffering _reconcentrados_ in Cuba, and forward the same to the\r\n Consul-General at Havana for distribution. My consent was then\r\n asked by all parties to go to Cuba and aid in the distribution of\r\n the shipments of food as they should arrive. After all I had so\r\n long offered, I could not decline, and hoping my going would not be\r\n misunderstood by our authorities there, who would regard me simply\r\n as a willing assistant, I accepted. The Consul-General had asked the\r\n New York Committee to send to him an assistant to take charge of the\r\n warehouse and supplies in Havana. This request was also referred to\r\n me, and recommending Mr. J. K. Elwell, nephew of General J. J. Elwell,\r\n of Cleveland, Ohio, a gentleman who had resided six years in Santiago\r\n in connection with its large shipping interests, a fine business man\r\n and speaking Spanish, I decided to accompany him, taking no member of\r\n my own staff, but going simply in the capacity of an individual helper\r\n in a work already assigned.\r\n\r\n On Saturday, February 6, we left Washington for Cuba _via_\r\n Jacksonville, Tampa, and Key West.\r\n\r\n Thus, with that simple beginning, with no thought on the part of any\r\n person but to do unobtrusively the little that could be done for\r\n the lessening of the woes of a small island of people, whom adverse\r\n circumstances, racial differences, the inevitable results of a\r\n struggle for freedom, the fate of war, and the terrible features of\r\n a system of subjugation of a people, which, if true, is too dark to\r\n name, was commenced the relief movement of 1898 which has spread\r\n not alone over the entire United States of America from Maine to\r\n California, from Vancouver to the Gulf of Mexico, but from the Indias\r\n on the west, to the Indias on the east, and uniting in its free-will\r\n offerings the gifts of one third of the best nations in the world.\r\n\r\nMiss Barton with her cargo of supplies reached Havana on February 9,\r\n1898. Her supplies were unloaded and stored in a convenient warehouse.\r\nShe began her work of visitation and found scenes beside which, as she\r\nwrote, some which she had witnessed in Armenia seemed humane. Six days\r\nafter her arrival the _Maine_ was blown up. The appalling news reached\r\nthe United States and brought with it the practical certainty of war.\r\nThe one cheering message that came as an echo of the explosion was\r\nClara Barton’s telegram, “I am with the wounded.” The comfort of these\r\nwords found expression in a little poem by James Clarence Harvey, which\r\nwas published immediately in the “Christian Herald” and widely copied:\r\n\r\n  “I am with the wounded,” flashed along the wire\r\n  From the isle of Cuba, swept with sword and fire.\r\n  Angel sweet of mercy, may your cross of red\r\n  Cheer the wounded living; bless the wounded dead.\r\n\r\n  “I am with the starving,” let the message run\r\n  From this stricken island, when this task is done;\r\n  Food and money plenty wait at your command,\r\n  Give in generous measure; fill each outstretched hand.\r\n\r\n  “I am with the happy,” this we long to hear\r\n  From the isle of Cuba, trembling now in fear:\r\n  May the great disaster touch the hearts of men,\r\n  And, in God’s great mercy, bring back peace again.\r\n\r\nMiss Barton thus related the story of the sinking of the _Maine_, and\r\nof the work that followed:\r\n\r\n The heavy clerical work of that fifteenth day of February held not\r\n only myself, but Mr. Elwell as well, busy at our writing-tables until\r\n late at night. The house had grown still; the noises on the streets\r\n were dying away, when suddenly the table shook from under our hands,\r\n the great glass door opening on to the veranda, facing the sea, flew\r\n open; everything in the room was in motion or out of place--the\r\n deafening roar of such a burst of thunder as perhaps one never heard\r\n before, and off to the right, out over the bay, the air was filled\r\n with a blaze of light, and this in turn filled with black specks like\r\n huge specters flying in all directions. Then it faded away. The bells\r\n rang; the whistles blew; and voices in the street were heard for a\r\n moment; then all was quiet again. I supposed it to be the bursting of\r\n some mammoth mortar or explosion of some magazine. A few hours later\r\n came the terrible news of the _Maine_.\r\n\r\n Mr. Elwell was early among the wreckage, and returned to give me news.\r\n\r\n She is destroyed. There is no room for comment, only who is lost, who\r\n has escaped, and what can be done for them? They tell us that most of\r\n the officers were dining out, and thus saved; that Captain Sigsbee is\r\n saved. It is thought that two hundred and fifty men are lost, that one\r\n hundred are wounded, but still living, some in hospital, some on small\r\n boats as picked up. The chief engineer, a quiet, resolute man, and the\r\n second officer met me as I passed out of the hotel for the hospital.\r\n The latter stopped me saying, “Miss Barton, do you remember you told\r\n me on board the _Maine_ that the Red Cross was at our service; for\r\n whenever anything took place with that ship, either in naval action or\r\n otherwise, _some one_ would be hurt; that she was not of a structure\r\n to take misfortune lightly?” I recalled the conversation and the\r\n impression which led to it,--such strength would never go out easily.\r\n\r\n We proceeded to the Spanish hospital San Ambrosia, to find thirty to\r\n forty wounded--bruised, cut, burned; they had been crushed by timbers,\r\n cut by iron, scorched by fire, and blown sometimes high in the air,\r\n sometimes driven down through the red-hot furnace room and out into\r\n the water, senseless, to be picked up by some boat and gotten ashore.\r\n Their wounds are all over them--heads and faces terribly cut, internal\r\n wounds, arms, legs, feet, and hands burned to the live flesh. The hair\r\n and beards are singed, showing that the burns were from fire and not\r\n steam; besides further evidence shows that the burns are where the\r\n parts were uncovered. If burned by steam, the clothing would have held\r\n the steam and burned all the deeper. As it is, it protected from the\r\n heat and the fire and saved their limbs, whilst the faces, hands, and\r\n arms are terribly burned. Both men and officers are very reticent in\r\n regard to the cause, but all declare it could not have been the result\r\n of an internal explosion. That the boilers were at the two ends of\r\n the ship, and these were the places from which all escaped who did\r\n escape. The trouble was evidently from the center of the ship, where\r\n no explosive machinery was located.\r\n\r\n I thought to take the names as I passed among them, and, drawing near\r\n to the first in the long line, I asked his name. He gave it with his\r\n address; then peering out from among the bandages and cotton about\r\n his breast and face, he looked earnestly at me and asked: “Isn’t this\r\n Miss Barton?” “Yes.” “I thought it must be. I knew you were here, and\r\n thought you would come to us. I am so thankful for us all.”\r\n\r\n I asked if he wanted anything. “Yes. There is a lady to whom I was to\r\n be married. The time is up. She will be frantic if she hears of this\r\n accident and nothing more. Could you telegraph her?” “Certainly!” The\r\n dispatch went at once: “Wounded, but saved.” Alas, it was only for a\r\n little; two days later, and it was all over.\r\n\r\n I passed on from one to another, till twelve had been spoken to\r\n and the names taken. There were only two of the number who did not\r\n recognize me. Their expressions of grateful thanks, spoken under such\r\n conditions, were too much. I passed the pencil to another hand and\r\n stepped aside.\r\n\r\n I am glad to say that every kindness was extended to them. Miss Mary\r\n Wilberforce had been at once installed as nurse, and faithful work\r\n she performed. The Spanish hospital attendants were tireless in\r\n their attentions. Still, there was boundless room for luxuries and\r\n comforts, delicate foods, grapes, oranges, wines, cordials, anything\r\n that could soothe or interest; and no opportunity was lost, or cost or\r\n pains spared, and when two days later the streets filled with hearses\r\n bearing reverently the bodies of martyred heroes; and the crape and\r\n the flowers mingled in their tributes of tenderness and beauty, and\r\n the muffled drums and tolling bells spoke all that inanimate substance\r\n could speak of sorrow and respect; and the silent marching tread of\r\n armies fell upon the listening ear,--the heart grew sick in the midst\r\n of all this pageant, and the thoughts turned away to the far land,\r\n smitten with horror, and the homes wailing in bitter grief for these,\r\n so lone, so lost; and one saw only the\r\n\r\n  Nodding plumes over their bier to wave,\r\n  And God’s own hand in that lonely land\r\n      To lay them in their grave.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the days after the sinking of the _Maine_, Miss Barton led an active\r\nlife. She journeyed through the nearer provinces, established bases of\r\nsupplies and returned to Havana, not only unmolested, but with every\r\nevidence of appreciation on the part of the Spanish authorities and\r\nthe Cuban people. The Red Cross supplies were distributed, though in\r\nplaces their distribution was impeded. Miss Barton tells of a delayed\r\ndistribution at Matanzas, the delay apparently having been accomplished\r\nwith intent, and how well-meant private philanthropy undertook direct\r\naction:\r\n\r\n It is not strange that from this event went out the cry of “starving\r\n Matanzas,” although at that moment, in addition to our four tons of\r\n goods previously sent, the _Fern_ lay in the harbor under the American\r\n flag, with fifty tons of American supplies, and fifty rods away lay\r\n the _Bergen_, under the same colors, bearing a cargo of fifty-two tons\r\n from the Philadelphia Red Cross, faithfully sent through the New York\r\n Committee, by request. So uncontrollable a thing is human excitement\r\n that these facts could not be taken in, and the charities of our\r\n whole country were called afresh to arms over “starving Matanzas,”\r\n which was at that moment by far the best provided city in Cuba. The\r\n result of this was an entire train of supplies from Kansas, which,\r\n remaining there after the blockade, not being consigned to the Red\r\n Cross, was, we were informed, distributed among the Spanish soldiery\r\n by the Spanish officials. Goods bearing the mark of the Red Cross were\r\n everywhere respected, and we have no record of any of _our_ goods\r\n having been appropriated by the Spanish authorities.\r\n\r\nWhen the methods of relief had been well organized, the work of\r\ndistribution went mainly to others while Clara Barton devoted her\r\nown energy to the maintenance of pleasant relations with the Spanish\r\nauthorities. This she was able to do until the very end; but events\r\nfar beyond her control were inevitably driving the two nations into\r\nwar. Miss Barton tells the story in the following record based upon the\r\nentries in her own diary:\r\n\r\n I met the Spanish authorities, not merely as a bearer of relief, but\r\n as the president of the American National Red Cross, with all the\r\n principles of neutrality which that implied, and received in return\r\n the unfailing courtesy which the conditions demanded. From our first\r\n interview to the last sad day when we decided that it was better to\r\n withdraw, giving up all efforts at relief, and leave those thousands\r\n of poor, dying wretches to their fate, there was never any change in\r\n the attitude of the Spanish authorities, General Blanco, or his staff,\r\n toward myself or any member of my staff. One of my last visits before\r\n the blockade was to the palace. The same kindly spirit prevailed;\r\n I was begged not to leave the island through fear of them; every\r\n protection in their power would be given, but there was no guarantee\r\n for what might occur in the exigencies of war. I recall an incident\r\n of that day: General Blanco led me to the large salon, the walls of\r\n which are covered with the portraits of the Spanish officials for\r\n generations past, and, pointing to the Spanish authorities under date\r\n of 1776, said, with a look of sadness, “When your country was in\r\n trouble, Spain was the friend of America. Now Spain is in trouble,\r\n America is her enemy.” I knew no answer for this but silence, and\r\n we passed out through the corridor of guards, he handing me to my\r\n carriage with a farewell and a blessing. I could but recall my\r\n experience with the Turkish officials and Government, where I entered\r\n with such apprehension and left with such marks of cordiality.\r\n\r\n During this interval of time important business had called me to\r\n Washington, and I only returned to Cuba sometime during the second\r\n week of April.\r\n\r\nOn April 25, 1898, Congress declared war against Spain. For two weeks\r\nit had been apparent that such a declaration was to come. American\r\ncitizens were ordered by the United States Government to leave Havana\r\nsome days before the outbreak of hostilities. This situation sent\r\nMiss Barton out of Cuba and quickly sent her back again. She was not,\r\nhowever, permitted at once to continue her relief for the distressed\r\nCubans. The military and naval authorities of the United States were as\r\nanxious not to aid Spain as the Spanish authorities were anxious that\r\nshe should not aid the rebellious Cubans. Miss Barton tells the story\r\nof her departure and return:\r\n\r\n The order was for all American citizens to leave Havana, and the order\r\n was obeyed, but not without having laid the matter formally in council\r\n before my staff of assistants and taking their opinion and advice,\r\n which was to the effect that, while personally they would prefer to\r\n remain for the chance of the little good that might be accomplished,\r\n in view of the distress which we should give our friends at home,\r\n and, in fact, the whole country, when it should be known that we\r\n were inside that wall of fire that would confront us, with no way of\r\n extricating or reaching us, it seemed both wiser and more humane to\r\n leave. And the 9th of April saw us again on shipboard, a party of\r\n twenty, bound for Tampa. We would not, however, go beyond, but made\r\n headquarters there, remaining within easy call of any need there might\r\n be for us. Here follow the few weeks of impending war. Do we need to\r\n live them over? Do we even want to recall them? Days when the elder\r\n men of thought and memory pondered deeply and questioned much! When\r\n the mother, patriot though she were, uttered her sentiments through\r\n choking voice and tender, trembling words, and the young men, caring\r\n nothing, fearing nothing, rushed gallantly on to doom and to death!\r\n To how many households, alas, these days recall themselves in tones\r\n never to be forgotten!\r\n\r\n Notwithstanding all this excitement and confusion and all the\r\n pressure that weighed upon him, our good President still remembered\r\n the suffering, dying _reconcentrados_, and requested that a ship be\r\n provided as quickly as possible, loaded from the warerooms of the\r\n indefatigable Cuban Relief Committee in New York, and be sent for the\r\n relief of the sufferers in Cuba whenever they could be reached. One\r\n need not say with what promptness this committee acted, and I was\r\n informed that the _State of Texas_, laden with fourteen hundred tons\r\n of food, would shortly leave New York _en route_ for Key West, and\r\n it was the desire of that committee and the Government that I take\r\n command of the ship, and, with my staff and such assistants as I would\r\n select, undertake the getting of that food to its destination.\r\n\r\n Some members of the staff were in New York, and with Dr. Hubbell in\r\n charge sailed from that port on Saturday, the 23d of April. A hasty\r\n trip from Washington, gathering up the waiting staff at Tampa, and\r\n pushing on by the earliest train brought us to Key West in time to\r\n meet the _State of Texas_ as she arrived, board her and take charge of\r\n the snug little ship that was henceforth to take its place in American\r\n history. She was well built, but by no means new, nor handsome. Her\r\n dull black hull could in no way compare with the snow-white, green and\r\n red striped hospital ships, those heralds of relief that afterwards\r\n graced the waters of that bay. Still she was firm, sound, heavy-laden,\r\n and gave promise of some good to some one at some future day, that day\r\n being only when the great war monsters should have pealed out to the\r\n world that an entrance was made on the coast of Cuba, and we would be\r\n invited to follow.\r\n\r\n By the authorities at Washington, the _State of Texas_ had been\r\n consigned to the protection of the navy, and accordingly we must\r\n report our arrival. This was done to the senior officer, representing\r\n Admiral Sampson, in the port, Captain Harrington, of the monitor\r\n _Puritan_. This brought at once a personal call from the captain\r\n with an invitation to our entire staff to visit his beautiful ship\r\n the following day. The launch of the _Puritan_ was sent to take us,\r\n and not only was the ship inspected, but the dainties of his elegant\r\n tea-table as well.\r\n\r\n When all was over, the graceful launch returned us safely to our\r\n ship, with grateful memories on the part of the younger members of\r\n our company, who had never chanced to form an intimate acquaintance\r\n with a piece of shipping at once so beautiful and so terrible as that\r\n death-dealing engine of destruction. I record this visit and courtesy\r\n on the part of Captain Harrington as the first of an unfailing series\r\n of kindnesses extended by the navy to the Red Cross from first to\r\n last. There was no favor too great, no courtesy too high to be\r\n cheerfully rendered on every occasion.\r\n\r\n The memories of pitiful Cuba would not leave us, and, knowing that\r\n under our decks were fourteen hundred tons of food, for the want of\r\n which its people were dying, the impulse to reach them grew very\r\n strong, and a letter was addressed to Admiral Sampson.\r\n\r\n This brought immediately the launch of the _New York_ to the side\r\n of our ship, and Captain Chadwick, the gallant officer whom no one\r\n forgets, stepped lightly on board to deliver the written message from\r\n the admiral, or rather to take me to the _New York_. Nothing could\r\n have exceeded the courtesy of the admiral, but we were acting from\r\n entirely opposite standpoints. I had been requested to take a ship,\r\n and by every means in my power get food into Cuba. He, on the other\r\n hand, had been commanded to take a fleet, and by every means in his\r\n power keep food out of Cuba. When one compared the two ships lying\r\n side by side and thought of a contest of effort between them, the\r\n situation was ludicrous, and yet the admiral did not absolutely refuse\r\n to give me a flag of truce and attempt an entrance into Havana; but he\r\n disapproved it, feared the results for me, and, acting in accordance\r\n with _his_ highest wisdom and best judgment, I felt it to be my place\r\n to wait.\r\n\r\nThe delay which resulted was annoying but not wholly unprofitable, and\r\nthere came a time when the army and navy were glad enough to have the\r\nAmerican Red Cross in Cuba. On June 20th the _State of Texas_ sailed\r\nfrom Key West with orders to find Admiral Sampson and report to him.\r\nThey found him a few days later off Santiago, in time for their share\r\nin the stirring events which accompanied and followed the destruction\r\nof Cervera’s fleet, the battle of San Juan Hill, and the surrender on\r\nJuly 17th of the harbor and city of Santiago.\r\n\r\nWhen the city had been formally surrendered and a sufficient number\r\nof mines had been removed from the harbor to permit American vessels\r\nto enter, a very gracious compliment was paid to Clara Barton by the\r\nvictorious United States Navy. The first vessel to enter the harbor was\r\nnot the flagship of either of the Admirals Sampson or Schley, but the\r\n_State of Texas_ under command of Clara Barton.\r\n\r\nPerhaps that may be called the crowning moment of her life. Clara\r\nBarton was more than seventy-eight years old, but she stood erect on\r\nthe deck of her vessel, modestly appreciative and quietly thankful, not\r\nso much for the honor that had come to her as for the opportunity of\r\nserving.\r\n\r\nMiss Barton returned to Washington in November, 1898. The work\r\nwhich she went to Cuba to perform, that of relieving the Cuban\r\n_reconcentrados_, was never wholly accomplished. That relief came\r\nwith the freedom of Cuba, and for this she was profoundly thankful;\r\nbut she never ceased to feel sad when she thought of the people who\r\nsuffered during those weeks of waiting while her vessel was packed\r\nwith the supplies which the people so sorely needed. “Cuba was a hard\r\nfield, full of heartbreaking memories,” she wrote. “It gave the first\r\nopportunity to test the first cooperation between the United States and\r\nits supplemental hand-maiden the Red Cross.”\r\n\r\nWhile this coöperation was incomplete, its results were most\r\nbeneficial, as many an American soldier and surgeon can testify.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the war, the Congress of the United States tendered\r\nthe thanks of the Nation to Clara Barton in the following resolution\r\nwhich was introduced in the Senate by the venerable Senator Hoar, and\r\nunanimously adopted:\r\n\r\n Resolved, That the thanks of Congress be presented to Clara Barton, of\r\n Massachusetts, founder of the institution of the Red Cross, and to the\r\n officers and agents of the Society of the Red Cross for their humane\r\n and beneficent service to humanity in relieving the distress of the\r\n Armenians and other suffering persons in Turkey, and in ministering\r\n to the sufferings caused by pestilence in the United States, and for\r\n the like ministration and relief given by them to both sides in the\r\n Spanish West Indies during the present war.\r\n\r\nAn even higher mark of appreciation was contained in the annual message\r\nof President McKinley:\r\n\r\n In this connection it is a pleasure for me to mention in terms of\r\n cordial appreciation the timely and useful work of the American\r\n National Red Cross both in relief measures preparatory to the\r\n campaigns, in sanitary assistance at several of the camps of\r\n assemblage, and later, under the able and experienced leadership\r\n of the president of the society, Miss Clara Barton, on the fields\r\n of battle and in the hospitals at the front in Cuba. Working in\r\n conjunction with the governmental authorities and under their sanction\r\n and approval, and with the enthusiastic coöperation of many patriotic\r\n women and societies in the various States, the Red Cross has fully\r\n maintained its already high reputation for intense earnestness\r\n and ability to exercise the noble purposes of its international\r\n organization, thus justifying the confidence and support which it\r\n has received at the hands of the American people. To the members and\r\n officers of this society and all who aided them in their philanthropic\r\n work, the sincere and lasting gratitude of the soldiers and the public\r\n is due and is freely accorded.\r\n\r\n In tracing these events we are constantly reminded of our obligations\r\n to the Divine Master for his watchful care over us and his safe\r\n guidance, for which the nation makes reverent acknowledgment and\r\n offers humble prayer for the continuance of his favor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nCLARA BARTON’S RETIREMENT FROM THE RED CROSS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would have been well if Clara Barton had retired from the active\r\nwork of the presidency of the American Red Cross at the close of\r\nthe war with Spain. She had accomplished in her lifetime an almost\r\nincredible total of heroic work. She had completed seventy-eight\r\nyears of service; she had created the American Red Cross and led it\r\nsuccessfully in peace and war. On twenty different fields on both\r\nsides of the ocean she had raised its banner over areas devastated by\r\nfire, flood, famine, and pestilence. She had won the support of her\r\nGovernment to an enterprise till then unknown and but little regarded.\r\nShe had made the Red Cross in America so useful in times of peace that\r\nthe Red Cross societies of the world had widened their spheres of\r\noperation to incorporate her plans of service. She had crowned her long\r\nand arduous career with an achievement that won for her the heart of\r\nthe American army and navy in Cuba, and brought to her the thanks of\r\nthe Congress and of the President of the United States. She could have\r\nretired with honors such as no woman in America ever had won. If her\r\njudgment told her that this was the time for her to transfer her burden\r\nof active supervision to some younger person, her heart triumphed over\r\nher judgment.\r\n\r\nShe was eighty years of age when, on September 8, 1900, a tornado and\r\ntidal wave submerged Galveston, Texas. Five days later Clara Barton\r\nwas on the ground. Difficulties of transportation held her back for\r\ntwenty-four hours or she would have been there a day sooner.\r\n\r\nHer plea for lumber, hardware, and other materials for providing\r\ntemporary shelter met with a nation-wide response, and supplies of food\r\nand clothing, as well as considerable sums of money, were placed at her\r\ndisposal.\r\n\r\nAfter six weeks spent in Texas, Clara Barton returned, worn out by\r\nher exertions, but bringing the grateful thanks of the people of\r\nGalveston, and, in addition, an official letter of thanks from the\r\ngovernor of the State of Texas and also of its legislature. The Central\r\nRelief Committee of Galveston also tendered her a series of engrossed\r\nresolutions, declaring that she deserved to be “exalted above queens,”\r\nand that her achievements were “greater than the conquests of nations\r\nor the inventions of genius.”\r\n\r\nIn the following year occurred the seventh International Conference of\r\nthe Red Cross, already referred to, held at St. Petersburg in Russia\r\nand extending from the middle of May until near the end of June of\r\n1902. Clara Barton headed the delegation from the United States. The\r\nconference was held under the high patronage of Her Majesty the Empress\r\nDowager Marie Feodorovna. Miss Barton was the guest of the Emperor\r\nand Empress. No delegate to the conference was treated with greater\r\nconsideration than Clara Barton. At the close of the conference she was\r\ndecorated by the Emperor, who conferred upon Clara Barton the Russian\r\ndecoration of the Order of the Red Cross.\r\n\r\nTwo of her letters concerning this journey have been quoted in a\r\nprevious chapter. Clara Barton returned to her own land crowned\r\nwith additional honors, but confronting new and wholly unexpected\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nThe American Red Cross had been reincorporated by Act of Congress\r\nJune 6, 1900. Under the new form of organization the board and its\r\nexecutive committee possessed large powers. There was a feeling on\r\nthe part of some members of the board that the American Red Cross was\r\ntoo exclusively under the direction of Clara Barton. Her work for\r\nthe relief of Galveston had been undertaken almost the moment that\r\nshe first learned of its great need. She had not waited to call an\r\nexecutive committee meeting. While her work in that field was most\r\nheartily commended, there was a feeling on the part of members of the\r\nboard that the Red Cross, being now virtually a representative organ\r\nof the United States Government, its fields of service should be\r\ndetermined, not by the judgment of an individual, but of the governing\r\nbody of the organization itself. There was further criticism growing\r\nout of the fact that, when emergencies arose by reason of any great\r\nnational disaster, a considerable part of the money was sent direct to\r\nClara Barton on the field, and expended by her without passing through\r\nthe hands of the treasurer.\r\n\r\nMiss Barton admitted that she had made these decisions at times without\r\nthe formal authority of her executive committee, and that she had\r\nreceived and expended money according to her best judgment when the\r\nemergency was at hand. She did not desire to be bound by burdensome\r\nrestrictions; she wished to be at liberty to meet the need whenever it\r\nshould arrive, and in the way that seemed to be necessary.\r\n\r\nIf everything had gone well with the Red Cross during the absence of\r\nClara Barton at St. Petersburg in 1902, it may be that she would have\r\nconsented to retire on her return from that notable experience. It was\r\nhardly likely that any further honor could have come to her higher than\r\nthat which she had already received. Theoretically she ought to have\r\nbeen training up assistants who would act effectively in her absence,\r\nand in time succeed her. It was in some respects a limitation on her\r\npart that she had not found assistants to whom she could delegate\r\nauthority with confidence that it would be properly used. On the other\r\nhand, she had made some experiments in training up associates, and\r\nfound reason to regret it.\r\n\r\nWhile Clara Barton was on her way to St. Petersburg the disastrous\r\nMont Pelée earthquake occurred. She had left the American Red Cross\r\norganized with a board of control which gave it authority to act\r\nin such an emergency. She returned from St. Petersburg bitterly\r\ndisappointed because the American Red Cross played in that disaster,\r\nas she felt, a wholly insignificant part. It seemed to her to have\r\ndisplayed a complete lack of that initiative which had always\r\ncharacterized her action under such conditions.\r\n\r\nRightly or wrongly Miss Barton felt that this inability to act promptly\r\nand decisively was in some measure the result of a divided authority.\r\nShe thereupon set in motion an effort to amend the by-laws so as to\r\nincrease the power of the president. These changed by-laws were adopted\r\nat the annual meeting of the American Red Cross in Washington, December\r\n9, 1902. Clara Barton was elected president for life and given the\r\nauthority which she deemed requisite for effective action.\r\n\r\nAn earnest protest was made against Miss Barton’s increase of power,\r\nand the disaffection increased throughout the year 1903. On January 2,\r\n1904, President Roosevelt notified Miss Barton that he could no longer\r\nserve as an officer of the Red Cross in the condition of unrest which\r\nhad developed.\r\n\r\nThree weeks later, on January 29th, the minority of the American Red\r\nCross presented a memorial to Congress charging that under the new form\r\nof organization practically all power was centered in the president\r\nof the society, who was elected for life and permitted to choose her\r\nown executive committee. A committee of investigation was appointed to\r\ninquire into the affairs of the Red Cross. Of this committee Senator\r\nRedfield Proctor was chairman.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to describe the emotions of Clara Barton when\r\nshe knew of the appointment of this committee. She was shocked and\r\nhorrified. She felt as if it had been a personal disgrace; and what\r\nwas worse, as she viewed it, she feared that it would result in a\r\ndissension that would ruin the American Red Cross. On the other hand,\r\nshe had no mind to retire while the investigation was on. Whatever\r\nhappened, she would not resign until the investigation ended.\r\n\r\nThe committee of investigation appears to have been a very sensible\r\nbody. It set about gathering such material as it needed, and the\r\nexamination of such witnesses as were produced by the remonstrants.\r\n\r\nThe remonstrance did not contain any charges of any dishonesty on the\r\npart of Miss Barton in the administration of the affairs of the Red\r\nCross; or, any charge of misappropriation of any property or money by\r\nMiss Barton; or any improper act or conduct of any kind which involved\r\nany element of moral turpitude.\r\n\r\nThe charges were, in brief:\r\n\r\n(_a_) That proper books of accounts were not kept at all times; and\r\n\r\n(_b_) that the property and funds of the Red Cross were not at all\r\ntimes distributed upon the order of the treasurer of the society, as\r\nalleged to be required by the by-laws of the society; and\r\n\r\n(_c_) that a certain tract of land in Lawrence County, Indiana, had\r\nbeen donated to the society by one Joseph Gardner; that the society\r\nwas reincorporated after such donation, and such donation was never\r\nreported to the new corporation.\r\n\r\nThe reply to these charges, in brief, was that, in the main, proper\r\nbooks of account had been kept, but, in so far as accurate books of\r\naccount had not been kept, it was due to the impossibility of keeping\r\nthem while active work was in progress on the field of disaster, and,\r\nin so far as the by-laws of the society had not been complied with in\r\nthe making of disbursements through the treasurer, it was impossible\r\nto do so during the stress of active relief work in the field; that so\r\nfar as the Gardner donation of Indiana land was concerned, no Red Cross\r\nmoney had ever been invested in it; that the title to the real estate\r\nwas always in the Red Cross and in the then existing corporate entity\r\nof the Red Cross, but that the land had not been found to be suited to\r\nthe work of the Red Cross and the title thereto had been allowed to\r\nlapse because of the accumulation of taxes and charges for maintenance\r\nwhich were found to be in excess of the utility of the land to the Red\r\nCross.[4]\r\n\r\nThe committee of investigation held three meetings, on April 12, April\r\n26, and May 2, 1904. Clara Barton did not attend in person, but was\r\nrepresented by counsel. It never became necessary for her to present\r\nher defense. At the close of the third meeting the chairman of the\r\ncommittee adjourned the hearing without day and the investigation\r\ncame to an end. The committee never presented a report; there was no\r\noccasion to do so. The proceedings of the committee are obtainable\r\nby any one who cares to read them, and they indicate with sufficient\r\nclearness the reasons which presumably influenced the committee in\r\nterminating the hearing after one side had been presented. There was no\r\nreason why the committee needed to hear anything in defense of Clara\r\nBarton.\r\n\r\nThe investigation having ended, Clara Barton presented her resignation\r\nJune 16, 1904. The resignation was accepted. The American Red Cross\r\ncame under its new form of organization with the President of the\r\nUnited States as nominal President of the Red Cross. The committee\r\nof the opposition had proposed that Clara Barton be made honorary\r\npresident for life with a salary to continue as long as she lived. She\r\ndid not accept either the office or the money. She retired from the Red\r\nCross, leaving it to the management of those who with her resignation\r\ncame into its control. Her own relation with the organization ceased\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\nClara Barton was normally responsive to praise and abnormally\r\nsensitive to criticism. In all the years of her public life she never\r\nrecovered from that supersensitiveness which had characterized her\r\nchildhood. Fulsome and excessive praise disgusted her, but she enjoyed\r\ndiscriminating appreciation. Straightforward opposition she could meet\r\nand bear, but she shrank from criticism at the hands of those who had\r\nbeen her friends, and such criticism hurt her far more than any one\r\ncould imagine who beheld her self-possession and outward calm. She\r\nseemed to the world to take opposition somewhat lightly, but she bled\r\nwithin her armor from wounds which the world never suspected.\r\n\r\nShe retired from the Red Cross broken-hearted. Her common sense ought\r\nto have saved her from nine tenths of the suffering which she endured\r\nin that unhappy experience. She felt that she had been denationalized,\r\nrepudiated by her own country, expatriated. She thought for a time\r\nthat she could not continue to live in the United States. She turned\r\nher eyes toward Mexico, and thought of going there partly to escape\r\nfrom the sorrows which confronted her, and which she painfully\r\nexaggerated, and partly with the thought that she might there establish\r\nsomething corresponding to the American Red Cross. She had a friend\r\nin California, Mr. Charles S. Young, who knew much about Mexico. On\r\nJanuary 13, 1904, after the appointment of the congressional committee\r\nand before any of its hearings, she wrote the following letter which\r\ncame as near to being hysterical as anything that Clara Barton ever\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n You will never know how many times I have thought of you, in this last\r\n hard and dreadful year to me. I cannot tell you, I _must_ not, and\r\n yet I _must_. So much of the time, under all the persecution, it has\r\n seemed to me I _could not_ remain in _this_ country, and have sought\r\n the range of the world for some place among strangers, and out of the\r\n way of people and mails, and longed for some one to point out a quiet\r\n place in some other land; my thoughts have fled to you, who could, at\r\n least, tell me a road to take outside of America, and who would ask\r\n the authorities of Mexico if a woman who could not live in her own\r\n country might find a home or a resting-place in theirs.\r\n\r\n This will all sound very strange to you--you will wonder if I am “out\r\n of my mind.” Let me answer--no. And if you had only a glimpse of what\r\n is put upon me to endure, you would not wonder, and in the goodness of\r\n your heart would hold open the gate to show me a mile track to some\r\n little mountain nook, where I might escape and wait in peace. Don’t\r\n think this is _common_ talk with me. I have never said it to others;\r\n and yet I think they who know me best _mistrust_ that I cannot bear\r\n _everything_, and will try in some way to relieve myself.\r\n\r\n To think of sitting here through an “investigation” by the country\r\n I have tried to serve--“in the interest of harmony” they say, when\r\n I have never spoken a discordant word in my life, meaningly, but\r\n have worked on in _silence_ under the fire of the entire press\r\n of the United States for twelve months,--forgiven all, offered\r\n friendship,--and still am to be “investigated” for “inharmony,”\r\n “unbusinesslike methods,” and “too many years”--all of these I cannot\r\n help. I am still unanimously bidden to work on for “life,” bear\r\n the burden of an organization--meet its costs myself--and am now\r\n threatened with the expense of the “investigation.”\r\n\r\n Can you wonder that I ask a bridle track? And that some other country\r\n might look inviting to me?\r\n\r\n Mr. Young, this unhappy letter is a poor return to make for your\r\n friendly courtesy, but _so long_ my dark thoughts have turned to you\r\n that I cannot find myself with the privilege of communicating with\r\n you, without expressing them. I cannot think where I have found the\r\n courage to do it, but I _have_.\r\n\r\n I know how unwise a thing it seems, but if the pressure is too\r\n great the bands may break; that may be my case, and fearing that my\r\n better judgment might bid me put these sheets in the fire--I send\r\n them without once glancing over. You need not forget, but kindly\r\n _remember_, rather, that they are the wail of an aching heart and\r\n that is all. Nature has provided a sure and final rest for all the\r\n heartaches that mortals are called to endure.\r\n\r\n If you are in the East again, and I am here, I pray you to come to me.\r\n\r\n Receive again my thanks and permit me to remain,\r\n\r\n  Your friend\r\n  CLARA BARTON\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conversation she said: “The Government which I thought I loved, and\r\nloyally tried to serve, has shut every door in my face and stared at me\r\ninsultingly through its windows. What wonder I want to leave?”\r\n\r\nIn another conversation, referring to the abandonment of her dream of\r\ngoing to Mexico, she said: “There were but two countries where the Red\r\nCross did not exist, China and Mexico. I did not want to go to China,\r\nbut did want to go to Mexico, and fully intended to go. My friends\r\nfinally dissuaded me and perhaps it was for the best, for if I had gone\r\nI probably would not have been alive now.”\r\n\r\nFrom this distance it is possible to view the whole situation in\r\nperspective. The present author has no hesitation in saying that the\r\ntime had come for Clara Barton to retire from the active work of the\r\nadministration of the American Red Cross. The organization had grown\r\nwell beyond the ability of any one person to manage it in the way that\r\nClara Barton had managed it so successfully in its earlier years.\r\nOn her return either from Cuba or St. Petersburg, she ought to have\r\nretired, accepting the honorary presidency, and giving over the control\r\nand active management to younger people. The author has witnessed in\r\nnot a few instances the pathetic struggle which goes on in the minds\r\nof elderly people on their prospective retirement from positions which\r\nhave outgrown them. It is a situation nothing less than tragic. A\r\nperson long identified with an organization comes easily to believe,\r\neither that he cannot get on without it, or that it cannot get on\r\nwithout him. Clara Barton had come to believe the latter concerning the\r\nAmerican Red Cross. She was mistaken.\r\n\r\nThere comes a time in the life of almost any organization when, if it\r\nis to prosper and enlarge, it must accept new leadership and adapt\r\nitself to changed conditions. A woman as sensible as Clara Barton\r\nwas in most things should have realized this situation and not have\r\npermitted herself to be heart-broken by a change as necessary for her\r\nas it was for the Red Cross.\r\n\r\nNor is it necessary at this time to refer to the fact that the\r\nchange might perhaps have been brought about in a kindlier spirit\r\nand with less of distress to a noble woman. If there was any lack of\r\nconsideration for her, it will do no good now to remember it, nor to\r\nascribe unworthy motives to any who had a share in it.\r\n\r\nOne thing, however, ought to be said concerning this tragic experience.\r\nIf Clara Barton did not bear this sorrow like a philosopher, she bore\r\nit like a Christian. The author has searched her diaries and most\r\nintimate papers of this period without finding in any of them any\r\nspirit of personal resentment or desire for revenge. She felt that she\r\nhad been deeply wronged, but she felt it not so much as a wrong done\r\nto her as an injury to the cause she loved. Her constant question was\r\nnot, What will become of me? but, What will become of the Red Cross?\r\nHer books had been kept honestly and she knew it; but she also knew\r\nthat, when money came to her on the field, she had been accustomed to\r\nspend it for the necessities of life for those she had come to help,\r\nand that not all of it had passed through the hands of the treasurer.\r\nShe knew that no committee of Congress could find any of this money in\r\nher possession, but she also knew that her system of book-keeping had\r\nnot been established with a view to a possibility of that kind of an\r\naudit. How would it affect the Red Cross if any scandal arose out of\r\nher unbusinesslike book-keeping?\r\n\r\nShe came in time to realize that she had taken this matter too\r\nseriously. She came to know the relief of lessened responsibility and\r\nto be glad that the Red Cross, with its cares and responsibilities and\r\nwidening sphere of influence, had been safely transferred to other\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nThe author may be permitted to add a personal word. In his personal\r\nconversation with Clara Barton concerning these unhappy events he\r\nnever heard her speak uncharitably of any of her opponents. He was not\r\nwith her during the time of the actual difficulty, and has sometimes\r\nregretted that he was not there. Had he known all that he now knows\r\nfrom months of labor spent in the examination of her most intimate\r\npapers, he would have advised her to retire in 1898 or 1902, and to\r\nturn over all her records to her successors, and enjoy for herself\r\na few years of unofficial honor before her long life closed. He did\r\nnot at that time possess the intimate knowledge which now is in his\r\npossession, of the whole life and method of work of the American Red\r\nCross under her administration. He is of the opinion that she ought to\r\nhave accepted her retirement, not only willingly but gladly, and that\r\nshe was far more troubled than she had need to be concerning the events\r\nwhich led to her retirement from office.\r\n\r\nBut this fact he records with sincere admiration for this noble\r\nwoman, the author’s friend and kinswoman, that in her conversation\r\nwith him in the years that followed, and in her diaries and intimate\r\nself-revelations of her private papers, he has found no word that\r\nseems inspired by selfish ambition, by personal resentment, or by any\r\nunworthy motive.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] As this second volume goes to press, there is placed in my hands a\r\ntypewritten brief by General W. H. Sears, who accompanied Miss Barton\r\non many of her fields of service, and who, from his personal knowledge\r\nand many compiled documents, answers in detail these charges. I have\r\nexamined this document of 162 pages with interest, but have not found\r\nit necessary to quote from it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nCLARA BARTON AT HOME\r\n\r\n\r\nClara Barton loved a home. Although she went forth from her father’s\r\nample and generous house while still she was a young woman, and lived\r\nas school-teacher, department clerk, and humanitarian for many years,\r\nshe never failed to make a home for herself if there was opportunity.\r\nHotel life had no charms for her, and, while she enjoyed entertainment\r\nin the homes of her friends and was a gracious and appreciative guest,\r\nshe always preferred a roof of her own above her head where she could\r\nbe hostess rather than guest and could minister instead of being\r\nministered unto. While she was a clerk in Washington, she had her own\r\nquarters to which she was accustomed to bring homeless women, girls\r\nwho lacked friendship, and others who were in need. While she was in\r\nEurope during the Franco-Prussian War, although at times the guest of\r\nroyalty, she fled from the too abundant hospitality of her friends and\r\nthe excessive luxury of hotels, and lived in her own rented lodgings.\r\n\r\nShe owned, and kept until her death, a summer home in Oxford. But\r\nthe home of which it is especially proper to speak is that which she\r\nerected for herself and the Red Cross, at Glen Echo, Maryland.\r\n\r\nMore than once Miss Barton had occasion to meditate on the prayer of\r\nPeter offered on the Mount of Transfiguration, that the disciples might\r\nbe permitted to erect three tabernacles and remain with Jesus and the\r\nspirits of the glorified saints. “Lord, it is good to be here,” is the\r\nenthusiastic cry of those who, being caught up by the spirit of a noble\r\ncharity, see no reason why it should not continue permanently. Clara\r\nBarton saw to it that her work was discontinued when the need for it\r\nhad passed.\r\n\r\nWhen she finished her work at Johnstown, she was requested by the\r\nlumber dealers not to give away miscellaneously the material which had\r\nbeen used in the erection of her temporary Red Cross buildings. Times\r\nwere returning to normal; there was employment at good wages for every\r\none who wanted to work; and there was no good reason why people should\r\nnot buy their lumber or why the lumber business should be demoralized\r\nby a thoughtless form of charity. Miss Barton knew that this was good\r\nsense. She learned who were the people who really needed and deserved\r\nfree lumber, and these she assisted; but a portion of the lumber she\r\nshipped to Washington and erected at Glen Echo, a few miles out from\r\nthe city, a permanent home for the American National Red Cross. Here\r\nshe made her home during the remainder of her life. Now and then she\r\nreturned for a few weeks to her summer home in Oxford, but the Red\r\nCross Headquarters was where she lived and moved and had her being.\r\nThere she dwelt and there she died.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to many to be far from an ideal home for her; it was a bare,\r\nbarnlike sort of place with two tiers of rooms, the upper tier opening\r\ninto a gallery as in the cabin of a steamboat. It was erected with\r\nreference to use as a possible storehouse and emergency hospital, as\r\nwell as a central office building for the organization and a shelter\r\nfor herself and her assistants. One might have expected that a woman\r\nwho was at heart a tidy housekeeper would have preferred to put her\r\nwarehouse and office building under one sufficiently ample roof, and\r\nto have erected for herself a little cottage adjacent; but Clara Barton\r\nlived and died surrounded by all that went into the daily performance\r\nof her work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLARA BARTON’S SUMMER HOUSE AT OXFORD, MASSACHUSETTS]\r\n\r\nThe author of this volume confesses to a certain chill and sinking of\r\nheart when he first saw the interior of the Glen Echo home. He wanted\r\nto take Clara Barton out of it and house her in a cozy little place\r\nof her own, where for a few hours of the day she could forget the Red\r\nCross and all its cares. But Clara Barton gloried in those undecorated\r\nboard walls as if they had been palatial. There she hung her diplomas\r\nand testimonials from foreign Governments as proudly as though they had\r\nbeen backed by glorious tapestry of cloth of gold. Her sitting-room was\r\nat the south of the house, overlooking the Potomac Canal; there she\r\nworked late at night and watched the moon as it rode over the tree-tops\r\nand reflected itself in the water. From the windows of her bedroom\r\njust above, she habitually witnessed the sunrise. Her narrow bed was a\r\nsoldier’s cot, and beside it was a little table with a candle, a pad of\r\npaper and a pencil. If, as often happened, she lay awake in the night,\r\nshe did not fret over her insomnia, but lighted her candle, propped\r\nherself in bed, wrote down the good thoughts that came to her, and then\r\nblew out the candle and went to sleep, and was refreshed for work at\r\nfive o’clock the next morning.\r\n\r\nBut there was a certain appropriateness in the construction of the\r\nGlen Echo home. One might look down from the bare walls that had seen\r\nservice in Johnstown to find his feet on a rug presented by a Turkish\r\nPasha; he searched the room in vain for relics, as such, for Clara\r\nBarton had no fondness for dust-gathering mementoes, but he could not\r\nfail to see about him inconspicuous trophies from hard-won fields of\r\nservice. There was no luxury, but there was a simple, homely comfort\r\nin the air of the place. The main hall of the building was two stories\r\nhigh, with a gallery around the upper tier of rooms. It was a place for\r\nservice, and that service was the joy and glory of her life.\r\n\r\nGlen Echo is on the banks of a canal along the Potomac, about eight\r\nmiles from the Capitol in Washington. This site she selected for\r\nherself in 1890, but did not occupy it until 1897. Her reasons for\r\nbuilding there were that the location gave her convenient access\r\nto Washington, with ample space and freedom for outdoor life and\r\nopportunity for storage of Red Cross supplies without the excessive\r\ncost which an adequate building would have required in Washington.\r\n\r\nAt the time she erected her home, a Chautauqua Assembly was in\r\noperation in Glen Echo, and her house adjoined the grounds. Indeed,\r\nher home was almost one of the Chautauqua buildings, the front being\r\nof native stone such as was used in the construction of the large\r\nauditorium and Hall of Philosophy which stood within a stone’s throw of\r\nher house. But the stone front which was the one picturesque feature\r\nof the house gave it a prison-like chill on the inside and had to be\r\nremoved, and the Chautauqua Assembly itself went down and gave place\r\nto a summer amusement park. Spite of the changes in the environment,\r\nClara Barton kept her home at Glen Echo. A Ferris wheel was erected at\r\nher front door; the roller-coaster went thundering by her window; the\r\ndancing in what had been the auditorium kept up till a late hour; and\r\nthe goddess of folly with cap and bells superseded divine philosophy\r\nin the hall dedicated to the latter; but Clara Barton lived and died in\r\nher home in Glen Echo.\r\n\r\nThe inside of her house was not much more luxurious than the outside.\r\nFew homes have been erected with so little attempt at display, or with\r\nsuch modest provision for reasonable comfort.\r\n\r\nIn one aspect the Glen Echo home was fashioned almost like a cathedral,\r\nbut in its practical arrangement much more like a ship. It had more\r\nwindows than either a ship or a cathedral. They were almost as thick as\r\nthey could be placed and leave any room for walls, but they were very\r\nplain windows, except that one on the stairs had a little inexpensive\r\nornamentation and the glass in the two front doors had a red cross in\r\neach.\r\n\r\nThe front door faced north and led into a long wide hall, cool in\r\nsummer, cold in winter, with an elongated oval well, railed round on\r\nthe two upper floors, so that from the main deck one looked up to the\r\nupper deck and the boat deck of the ship-like building. This central\r\nthree-deck cabin was ceiled with unpainted wood, not unattractive\r\nbut unadorned. Doors opened on either side at regular intervals, and\r\nbetween the doors were deep closets where blankets, Horlick’s Malted\r\nMilk, canned goods and emergency supplies of various kinds were duly\r\nstored and catalogued. If a fire or a flood broke out in any part of\r\nthe country, Clara Barton was ready to start and had something with\r\nwhich to begin relief.\r\n\r\nIt was this attempt to combine in one a home, a storehouse, a place of\r\nrefuge for the needy, and a kind of organization headquarters which\r\nstruck the visitor so strangely and almost repellently. She might have\r\nbuilt a little bungalow for herself and her offices and housed her\r\nsupplies in a separate building erected for storage purposes and with\r\nemergency sleeping-rooms attached, but she wished it otherwise and she\r\nhad her way.\r\n\r\nIf the reader had been privileged to visit Clara Barton there during\r\nher lifetime and had made his way down the rather long cabin to her own\r\nquarters in the south end of this ship-like cathedral, he would have\r\nfound Clara Barton at home. It would have made little difference how\r\nearly or how late the call was made. She was up with the sun and often\r\nbefore, weeding her garden, feeding her chickens, caring for her pets,\r\nand looking after her house. She rarely went to bed before midnight.\r\nFourteen to eighteen hours a day of work she did steadily until her\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that she has an important address to deliver to-morrow\r\nnight. This is the way she prepares for it. She rises at five this\r\nmorning and does her own room work. Her bedding is aired, her bed is\r\nmade, and the carpet sweeper is rolling over her floor before six\r\no’clock gives its warning to other members of the household. She eats\r\na simple breakfast with her household and guests and wastes no time,\r\nbut still is in no haste about it. She gives no intimation that she is\r\nin a hurry, and enjoys the breakfast-table conversation, evincing a\r\nkeen sense of humor and a hearty interest in all human happenings. She\r\nannounces that she has attended to her most important correspondence\r\nfor the morning, and excuses herself to see to the ways of her\r\nhousehold. It is the day her curtains are to be washed, and she has to\r\nsuperintend affairs in the laundry and make some changes in her garden.\r\nShe puts in very nearly the whole day in physical labor. She knows\r\nwell how to direct the work of others, but she does not scorn to take\r\nthe flatiron or the garden trowel in her own hands and show how she\r\nwants things done. Moreover, she gets things done the way she wants\r\nthem. That is a habit of hers.\r\n\r\nShe lingers after the luncheon and evening meal and engages in cheerful\r\nconversation. Instrumental music has no charm for her, but good\r\nsinging she enjoys if there is a distinct melody and if the words mean\r\nsomething. She likes to hear men sing better than she likes to hear\r\nwomen, and she likes the songs she knows, and is willing to hear them\r\nagain and again. If among the guests is one who sings, she is a good\r\nlistener. But the greater part of the evening is spent in conversation.\r\nClara Barton was a good conversationalist. She could listen without\r\nrestlessness and talk without monopolizing the privilege of talking.\r\nShe was quick to see a point. She had a voice which was low, and while\r\nnot sweet or musical was pleasant, and its cadences were those of the\r\ngentlewoman. Her sentences were always perfectly formed. Her grammar\r\nnever needed apology; her speech was precise, but free from pedantry.\r\nHer talk was habitually cheerful. She was respectful of the opinions of\r\nothers and never failed to have an opinion of her own.\r\n\r\nAfter her guests have gone to bed, her light still burns. She sits\r\nin her south room, where she said it seemed as if “it was always\r\nmoonlight,” and in her work she enjoyed the companionship of the\r\nwoods, the stars, and the many voices of the night. Even the racket\r\nof the dancing and the whirl of the merry-go-round with the joyously\r\nfrightened squeals of the girls descending the roller-coaster was far\r\nless objectionable than it would have been if it had been her habit to\r\nretire early.\r\n\r\nBut she is not yet working on her address. She is taking care of the\r\nbelated mail which the day has brought and which her duties in the\r\ngarden and laundry have kept her from attending to, but she has been\r\nthinking about the address more or less during the day, although when\r\nmidnight comes she has not written a word of it. Beside her bed,\r\nhowever, she places a candle, a pencil, and a pad.\r\n\r\nClara Barton’s bed was a cot. It was not a very soft cot either.\r\nShe was never a poor woman. From her father she inherited a modest\r\npatrimony, and she always had more than enough money of her own to\r\nsupply her needs. She could have had a wide and soft bed if she had\r\nwanted it. She had just what she wanted, and she never cared to have\r\npeople tell her that she ought to have things differently in so far as\r\nthey related to her own comfort.\r\n\r\nDo not think she was an ascetic or slept in a hard bed because she\r\nscorned bodily comfort. Comfort she had and exactly as much of it as\r\nshe wanted. Luxury she did not want. She thanked no one for wasting any\r\npity upon her. Her bed was as wide as she wished it, and as soft as she\r\ncared to have it, and in it she slept soundly and was refreshed.\r\n\r\nBefore it was light she woke and reached for her matches and her\r\npencil, and sitting up in bed she wrote her address as fully as she\r\ncared to have it written. She rarely erased a word. Her mind was clear\r\nand her speech came to her just in the form in which she wished it. Her\r\nyears of training as a school-teacher had laid well the foundations of\r\nher composition and rhetoric. She wrote, not rapidly, but accurately,\r\nand each word said exactly what she wanted to say.\r\n\r\nHer address is finished before daylight, and she puts out the light and\r\ntakes her final nap, but is up at her accustomed time, having enjoyed\r\na good night’s rest, and is out in the garden and looking after the\r\npoultry until she joins her guests at breakfast.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast she copies her address in ink. Her handwriting is like\r\ncopper-plate. When it is copied, she lays it aside. The process of\r\ncopying it has photographed it upon her mind. She can deliver it either\r\nwith or without manuscript. Although she trembles at the sight of an\r\naudience, she has learned to face one with perfect composure and no\r\nword of her speech escapes her memory.\r\n\r\nPerhaps she excuses herself from lunch to-day and works at her desk,\r\nbut not at the speech she is to deliver. It is her habit to keep free\r\nfrom any needless accumulation of unfulfilled duties. She sees her\r\nguests at the table and is herself within call, but for herself she has\r\nordered an apple, a slice of bread, and a piece of cheese. No member of\r\nher household will suggest to her that she ought to eat more, and if\r\none of her guests feels some compunction at eating a more ample repast\r\nwhile her hostess dines on homely fare, it is better that she keep her\r\ncompunction to herself. If the guest should rise from the table and\r\nwalk into the other room, carrying some delicacy, she would meet a mild\r\nrebuke. “I asked for exactly what I wanted,” Clara would say.\r\n\r\nOutside the window at which she sits the mason wasps build their nests\r\nof mud. Woe unto the man who molests them! The sparrow finds a house\r\nand the swallow a nest in the shelter of the Lord of hosts, and the\r\nwasps are as welcome as the birds to a home at Glen Echo. Two or\r\nthree wasps fly through the open window and light upon her half-eaten\r\napple. She will not permit them to be driven away. There is enough for\r\nthe wasps and for herself. Like Saint Francis and the birds, she is\r\nat home with every kind of gentle life, and the wasps, she maintains,\r\nare gentle if gently treated. She gently pushes them away from her\r\napple when she is ready for another bite, cutting off a piece with her\r\ndesk-knife and leaving it on the corner of her desk for the wasps. They\r\nalso have a further portion in the core. They light upon her hand, her\r\nforehead, they buzz round her, but they never sting her. She and they\r\nare friends.\r\n\r\nThis is the kind of life Clara Barton lived in Glen Echo; and this is\r\nwhat those were privileged to see who visited her in her home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nCLARA BARTON’S RELIGION\r\n\r\n\r\nClara Barton was a religious woman. Her diaries, her home letters,\r\nher intimate confidences, all breathe a deeply religious spirit.\r\nBut she was reserved concerning her personal religious feelings and\r\nconvictions. Once, when she was abruptly asked by a stranger in a group\r\nof strangers what were her religious opinions, she answered that she\r\ncould not undertake to answer so large a question in so short a time.\r\nShe recorded this in her diary, with some resentment that she should\r\nhave been called upon thus to stand and deliver at sight.\r\n\r\nBut sitting beside a dying soldier, she had no hesitation in praying\r\nwith him, nor of telling him unreservedly her own faith in God and\r\nimmortality.\r\n\r\nShe was reared a Universalist. In that faith she lived the greater part\r\nof her life. She did not, however, join the Universalist Church in her\r\nhome town, and she went away quite early and never established personal\r\nrelations with a church.\r\n\r\nHer satisfaction in church-going was almost wholly in the sermon. For\r\nmusic she did not care, and there was nothing in ritual that appealed\r\nto her. But a well-reasoned sermon she enjoyed. Henry Ward Beecher was\r\nher favorite preacher, and she did not miss an opportunity of hearing\r\nhim if she could help it. A truly great sermon or great address of any\r\nkind made a strong impression upon her; nor was it wholly intellectual.\r\nShe was remarkably receptive and open to spiritual impressions.\r\nA woman of intellect and will, she was also a woman of unusually\r\nsensitive feelings and of deep, though controlled, emotions. She was\r\never eager to learn and had to the end of her life unshaken faith in\r\nthe discovery and application of new truth.\r\n\r\nIt was reported in 1908 that Clara Barton had gone over to Christian\r\nScience. The report was not wholly correct. She became interested\r\nin Christian Science, but she never adopted it. The minister of the\r\nUniversalist Church in Oxford, the Reverend Mr. Schoppe, became a\r\nChristian Science practitioner and reader, and she was much interested\r\nthrough him and his wife in this change on his part.\r\n\r\nShe was interested in Mrs. Eddy. It seemed to her a notable thing for\r\na woman, alone and against great opposition, to have accomplished what\r\nshe did.\r\n\r\nShe once witnessed the wreck of a sight-seeing automobile filled with\r\nChristian Science visitors to Boston, and she was impressed by the\r\nfortitude with which they bore pain.\r\n\r\nMoreover, she had good reason to know that there is much reckless\r\nuse of medicine and much needless surgery. She had memories of years\r\nin which she suffered many things of many physicians and was nothing\r\nbetter, but rather worse. She saw, in war and in peace, much use of\r\nthe knife that seemed to her bloody and cruel. She saw women hurrying\r\nto the operating-table, sometimes, as she believed, for no better\r\nreason than to escape the risk of motherhood, and she scorned them. She\r\nexpressed herself to me in terms anything but gentle concerning married\r\nwomen who willingly deprive themselves of the perilous privilege of\r\nmotherhood by resort to surgery. She believed that people who take\r\nmedicine usually take too much; and that cheerful and wholesome living\r\nis better than medicine.\r\n\r\nMoreover, she was always ready for a thing that was new. Her delight in\r\nthe discovery of something hidden and now revealed was intense.\r\n\r\nFor all these reasons she was disposed to give Christian Science a fair\r\nhearing.\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Epler’s excellent biography, free use is made of Miss Barton’s\r\ncorrespondence with Mr. and Mrs. Schoppe, in which she expressed her\r\ninterest in their new faith. My own conviction is, that while Clara\r\nBarton was thus deeply interested, those letters tend to enlarge the\r\ndegree of her permanent interest. I am confident that she was less\r\nnear to being a Christian Scientist than the letters themselves would\r\nindicate if taken alone. Indeed, Mr. Schoppe himself gives what I think\r\nis a wholly truthful statement, as recorded by Mr. Epler, under date of\r\nDecember 17, 1914:\r\n\r\n Clara Barton’s connecting point with Christian Science was on the\r\n positives it accented--not from its negative philosophy. She welcomed\r\n its doctrine of the Divine presence of God working with us and in us\r\n and working upon her own life--present to help. She was exceedingly\r\n grateful to Christian Science for bringing out this point of the\r\n Divine absoluteness.\r\n\r\n Further than that she could not understand it; she could not go.\r\n She did not deny, but she believed (unlike the Christian Science\r\n negativism) in a perfectly vast realm of material and human progress.\r\n She traced it in the wonders of geological ages and historical\r\n evolution. She saw God’s handiwork in a colossal complex material\r\n creation. She never could bring herself to believe the material or\r\n human creation a mortal error!\r\n\r\nI regard this as wholly correct. She read “Science and Health” and\r\nendeavored to use the “absent treatment” of the Schoppes. The first\r\nnight it seemed to do good, and the next night the effect was gone. Her\r\neffort to obtain whatever was good in Christian Science was sincere;\r\nbut her experiments did not make her a Christian Scientist.\r\n\r\nShe employed physicians till the day of her death, and took medicine.\r\nBut she believed that spiritual things are the real things, and that\r\nman is more than body.\r\n\r\nThe two ministers whom she selected to have charge of her funeral in\r\nthe old home in Oxford were both Congregationalists. The Reverend\r\nPercy H. Epler was chosen for his long friendship, and the Reverend\r\nWilliam E. Barton for that and for his kinship. She did not choose, but\r\nwould have been happy to have chosen, had her plans been worked out in\r\ndetail, the Reverend Doctor Tyler, an aged minister of the Universalist\r\nfaith, to have a share in the services. Happily, he was present, and\r\ndid participate. He had baptized and buried whole generations of the\r\nOxford Bartons, and it was a benediction to have him standing, like a\r\npatriarch, above her coffin, and speaking words of comfort and hope.\r\n\r\nHer choice of Congregational ministers to perform this service did\r\nnot imply a lack of honor for the church of her childhood. Yet, in\r\nsome respects, her associations in later years were more intimate with\r\nCongregationalists than with Universalists.\r\n\r\nI have no reason to suppose that she talked with any one more freely\r\nthan she talked with me about her religion, or about her relations to\r\nthe Universalist Church. I think I can represent her views essentially\r\nas they were.\r\n\r\nShe continued to believe all that was essential in the faith which she\r\nhad been taught in the church of Hosea Ballou. She trusted in a God\r\nwhom she believed too great and good to make an eternal hell necessary\r\nto his government. If God was infinite and also desired the salvation\r\nof all men, if He was not willing that any should perish, but that all\r\nshould come unto Him and live; if Christ tasted death for every man;\r\nthen, as it seemed to her, ultimately, sin must be eliminated from\r\nthe moral universe and with sin must go punishment. She believed, not\r\nonly with Ballou, but with Beecher, that God will not punish after\r\npunishment ceases to do good. That sin brings punishment she believed\r\nand knew, but that sin and punishment must go on eternally seemed\r\nto her to imply either that God was not wholly good or not wholly\r\nSovereign.\r\n\r\nHer Universalism was essentially Calvinistic; it was based on the\r\nsovereignty of God. She believed that God was great enough to\r\n\r\n    “treasure up his bright designs,\r\n  And work his sovereign will.”\r\n\r\nShe believed in the divinity of Christ. She was not a Unitarian. But\r\nshe held to Christ’s divinity as a divinity of preëminence and not\r\nof exclusion. She believed that Jesus became the Son of God by moral\r\nprocesses which are essentially within the reach of men, “that He might\r\nbe the first-born among many brethren.”\r\n\r\nI think I can give a truthful impression about her feeling with regard\r\nto Universalism as an independent ecclesiastical organization. She\r\ntalked freely with me about this, and expressed the definite wish that\r\nthe Universalist Church and the Congregational Church might everywhere\r\nbe reunited. She had something of the same feeling with regard to the\r\nUnitarian churches. She loved the memory of Theodore Parker, whom\r\nshe sometimes felt she recognized as guiding her long years after\r\nhis death. She honored him, and other of the Unitarian men of his\r\ngeneration. She felt that both Unitarianism and Universalism had been\r\nnecessary protests against the immoral orthodoxy of the time of their\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nBut she felt that that protest was no longer needed, at least to the\r\nsame extent. She felt the waste of competing religious organizations.\r\nThe Universalist Church was the church of her father, but the\r\nCongregational Church was the church of his fathers. She had more\r\nfriends in the latter than in the former. She told me she would be glad\r\nto see the liberty of thought which Universalism had stood for sacredly\r\npreserved in a union of those denominations.\r\n\r\nShe said, “What I see in Oxford I see everywhere, a need that churches\r\nshall forget old and past disputes, and come into more compact\r\norganization, merging denominations, and preserving religious liberty.”\r\n\r\nIt is a hazardous thing to repeat, after years have gone by, the\r\nimpressions left by oral conversations. Yet I am confident that in this\r\nmeager outline I give her essential faith.\r\n\r\nShe did not talk glibly about her faith. But it was very real, and very\r\ndefinite, and it remained with her to the end.\r\n\r\nConcerning revivals of religion she wrote to a niece who, in the\r\nwidespread religious interest awakened by Mr. Moody in the seventies,\r\nhad been asked by an evangelist to take a step which, as she looked\r\nback upon it, implied more than she had intended:\r\n\r\n  Thursday night\r\n\r\n If one acts with good intentions, believing they are doing rightly,\r\n and later, concludes it was unwise or wrong--there is a mistake\r\n somewhere, or has been. It may have been in the act, or it may be in\r\n the later conclusion, but it is only a mistake, not a sin, you poor\r\n little chick.\r\n\r\n Another time when you are requested in prayer meeting to act on a\r\n double question, the putter of it mixing up your desire or willingness\r\n to stand up before an audience and be made a subject for public\r\n prayers with an act of personal courtesy or discourtesy to himself as\r\n to whether you want to hear him or _not_, once leaves you free to vote\r\n as you like, and then comes and questions your decision, and asks your\r\n reason,--if you feel like answering him at all,--tell him to divide\r\n his questions, put one at a time and you will act on each separately.\r\n He put two questions together, as a dodge to get all up to be prayed\r\n for, thinking and knowing it put every one in a hard place, as all\r\n would see that it was a little impolite not to hasten to accept his\r\n offer to come and preach. Oh, how tricky.\r\n\r\n You have done rightly in it all, my dear little girl. When he asked\r\n why you did not side with the Lord you answered that you did. That\r\n was right and all he could ask for. When he added, “Then why did you\r\n not rise and kneel,” you might tell him you did not understand that\r\n request as coming from the Lord, or you should certainly have done so.\r\n\r\n I send you a “Banner of Light” to-day. You will find two articles\r\n bearing on your subject--the one a lecture by a good sturdy Briton on\r\n Mr. Moody’s sermon on “Hell.” I think you will read it with interest\r\n just now, and every time you get assaulted in public prayer meeting,\r\n and followed by men, I should advise you to run home and calm your\r\n hysterical nerves by re-reading that lecture from end to end.\r\n\r\n The other longer marked article on “Revivalism” is a fine sermon by\r\n a sound Unitarian clergyman who does not believe in special revivals\r\n of religion, as gotten up for the occasion, and to fill churches, but\r\n thinks religion, as being the best part of man’s nature, will revive\r\n itself like all else in nature, and feels that God does not need to\r\n be implored to save from endless pain and loss the poor creatures He\r\n has made, but believes that if we do our best to enlighten and elevate\r\n those around us we do all we are called upon to do in the way of their\r\n salvation.\r\n\r\n But read it well and carefully for yourself, or read it again with Ida\r\n and “reason together” about it and see if you can find in your own\r\n convictions some justification for the course you are taking with the\r\n S.S. There is much to be read, before you decide, much to learn and\r\n consider; take time and do it and don’t either fall into a trap nor be\r\n driven into one.--Selah!\r\n\r\nShe retained to the end of her life a high regard for the church of her\r\nfathers, the Universalist Church. Of it she wrote to Mrs. Jennie S. M.\r\nVinton at Oxford:\r\n\r\n I am glad to learn by your valued letter of September 5th that the\r\n old church of our fathers is about to be refitted and I thank you for\r\n the information. It is thoughtful of you to name the facts of the\r\n early history of the church which I am happy to corroborate, both by\r\n tradition and recollection. My father was present at the ordination\r\n sermon of Hosea Ballou (a white-headed boy he seemed). He was one of\r\n the pillars of the church. His family came over the hills of extreme\r\n North Oxford, five miles every Sunday, to sit in its high pews. When\r\n I was a grown young woman it was decided to build the present church,\r\n and no body of church people ever worked harder than we. We held\r\n fairs, public and home, begged, and gave all but the clothes we wore;\r\n we cleaned windows and scrubbed paint after workmen, bought and nailed\r\n down carpets, fitted up the parsonage, and received the bride of the\r\n Reverend Albert Barnes, our first settled pastor. And I carried their\r\n first baby to the christening.\r\n\r\n There are few people there who have memories of harder church work and\r\n better church love than I.\r\n\r\n Think this over, dear sister, and remember that I have never lost my\r\n love for the old church of my fathers, my family, and my childhood.\r\n\r\nShe believed whole-heartedly in immortality. Not only so, but she\r\nbelieved that her friends were near. She never recovered from the\r\nimpression that came to her, after the death of her brother Stephen,\r\nthat he was an influence, a living influence, for good in her life.\r\nThat influence was exerted directly. As she woke in the morning while\r\nit was yet dark, and faced the duties of the day, she was able to think\r\nand plan with such clarity of vision that she felt that she was helped\r\nby the presence of those whom she had loved and who had counseled her\r\nin life. Through Stephen she felt the influence of her mother, as she\r\nbelieved, and, less directly, that of her father. She said, “I do not\r\nbelieve I am a Spiritualist,” but she could not shake off, and did not\r\ndesire to shake off, the conviction that those whom she had loved were\r\nnear her.\r\n\r\nThe latest, and in some respects the most satisfactory, statement of\r\nher faith, was written a year before her death, to Judge A. W. Terrell,\r\nof Austin, Texas:\r\n\r\n I suppose I am not what the world denominates a church woman. I lay\r\n no claim to it. I was born to liberal views, and have lived a liberal\r\n creed. I firmly believe in the divinity of Jesus Christ, the Jesus of\r\n Nazareth; in His life and death of suffering to save the world from\r\n sin, so far as in His power to do. But it would be difficult for me\r\n to stop there and believe that this spark of divinity was accorded to\r\n none other of God’s creation, who, like the Master, took on the living\r\n form, and, like him, lived the human life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE PERSONALITY OF CLARA BARTON\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of her public career, Clara Barton was short of\r\nstature and slender as she was short. Her form rounded out in middle\r\nlife, but she never exhibited any approach to stoutness. She was so\r\nwell proportioned as to give the impression of being taller than she\r\nwas. When she spoke in public, if she stood beside a presiding officer,\r\nit was seen that she was small of stature, but when she stood alone,\r\nshe gave the impression of being, and was often described as being,\r\nabove medium height. Her maximum height, attained in adolescence,\r\nwas five feet two inches in moderately high-heeled shoes. The author\r\nmeasured her in her later years, and she was exactly five feet tall\r\nwithout her shoes.\r\n\r\nHer carriage was erect, except for a slight stoop in the shoulders.\r\nThere never came any sag in her person, any letting down of her erect\r\nstanding. Her spine below the shoulders was carried to the end of her\r\nlife as erect as in youth. As she stood or sat, she never had the\r\nbearing of an old person. When seated, she commonly kept her back well\r\naway from the back of the chair, depending upon nothing external to\r\nassist her in maintaining her erect bearing.\r\n\r\nShe walked quietly, deliberately, and flat-footedly. She put her whole\r\nfoot down at once. There was a certain firmness in her gait which\r\nindicated strength of character and resolute purpose. She did not dart\r\nor rush or drift or flutter; she walked, and her walk was of moderate\r\nspeed and of marked decision.\r\n\r\nHer hair was brown, and in her younger days she had great wealth of it.\r\nShe took good care of it; and, while there was less of it in her later\r\nyears, it retained its fine texture, its soft silky wave, and its rich\r\nbrown color. The writer asked her once if she had a single gray hair.\r\nShe replied that she thought she had one, but had forgotten just where\r\nit was.\r\n\r\nHer eyes were brown, and in some lights appeared black. I find at least\r\none description of her as she appeared on the lecture platform in which\r\nshe was described as tall, with hair and eyes black as the raven’s\r\nwing. The reporter is not to be blamed for his departure from truth.\r\nShe looked tall when she stood alone, and her eyes and hair appeared as\r\nhe described them, when seen in some lights.\r\n\r\nHer features were regular. Her nose was prominent and straight. Her\r\nmouth was large, and very expressive. Her features were remarkably\r\nmobile. Her forehead was both high and wide, and in her middle life\r\nshe wore her hair so that its full breadth and height appeared beneath\r\nthe graceful parting of the hair. In her later years her hair was\r\ncombed down over the temples on either side, and remained parted in the\r\nmiddle. Her chin was a very firm chin. It did not protrude, neither did\r\nit recede. There was not the slightest suggestion of a lantern-jaw;\r\nbut there was a clear-cut prominence of the chin that suggested a firm\r\ndecision and a tenacious purpose. She said to the writer, “Every true\r\nBarton knows how to possess an open mind and teachable disposition with\r\na firmness that can be obstinate if necessary, and no one can be more\r\nobstinate than a Barton.” Obstinate she certainly could be, but she\r\nwas reasonable to a marked degree. No one who saw her shut her mouth\r\nwhen she had made a decision could cherish any doubt of her tenacity of\r\npurpose; and her chin was anything but a weak one.\r\n\r\nShe did not stare, but she had a habit of fixing her eyes upon an\r\nobject or a person which did not put arrogance or pretense at ease.\r\nShe could, on occasion, look through a person as if she discerned his\r\ninmost thoughts. But ordinarily her look into one’s face was gentle and\r\ncompanionable and sympathetic.\r\n\r\nClara Barton affected none of the arts by which women advanced in years\r\nattempt to appear young. On the other hand, she had no intention of\r\ngrowing old. She said to me that she did not see why people should be\r\nso curious about anybody’s age; what did it matter? So far as she was\r\nconcerned, there was no secret about it; but when people had learned\r\nthe date of her birth, how could they know whether she was old or young?\r\n\r\nShe did not greatly like to be asked for her “latest photograph.” The\r\nphotograph which she liked best, the one which she had framed and which\r\nthe author has just as it stood on her desk, was the familiar Civil War\r\nportrait.\r\n\r\nOn December 30, 1910, she wrote in her diary, concerning her friend,\r\nJulia Ward Howe, whose death she mourned, and whose biography she had\r\nread through with keen interest:\r\n\r\n I notice a strife over the placing of Mrs. Howe’s portrait in Fanueil\r\n Hall. The art committee object to it, but the people demand that it\r\n be placed there. No reasons on the part of the art committee are yet\r\n given. The painting is by Mr. Elliott, husband of Maude. I wonder at\r\n the idea of people having their pictures taken after time and age\r\n have robbed them of all their characteristic features. I regard this\r\n as a mistake. I want the last picture of the friends I love to show\r\n them in their strength and at their best. Mrs. Howe’s picture as now\r\n painted would have shocked even herself in strong middle life. Why not\r\n show the world the writer of the “Battle Hymn of the Republic” as she\r\n was when she wrote it? Is it the rush of the curious for the “latest\r\n photo”? I think the idea wrong. I wish the art committee would insist\r\n on a picture of Mrs. Howe at the age of forty years.\r\n\r\nWhen Clara Barton was in her eighties, she often, as was her custom,\r\nwould sit upon the floor, _à la_ Turk, with her work spread around her.\r\nWhen her work was finished, she would rise, with the suppleness of a\r\ngirl, without touching her hands to the floor.\r\n\r\nShe had an almost morbid shrinking from the infliction of pain, or from\r\nthe taking of life. She was not strictly a vegetarian. If she was at\r\nanother’s table and meat was offered her, she ate it sparingly.\r\n\r\nShe carried through life a pulse ten beats slower to the minute than\r\nthat of an ordinary woman of her years, but her pulse beat steadily\r\nand reliably. A half-cup of coffee stimulated her almost to the point\r\nof intoxication, and a child’s dose of medicine was too much for her.\r\nSo simply did she live that when she died at the age of ninety-one\r\nthere was not a physical lesion, not a diseased organ in her body. Her\r\nphysician, who for thirty years had been her almost daily companion,\r\nDr. J. B. Hubbell, declared that, barring accident, or some acute\r\nattack, such as that which actually caused her death, she could easily\r\nhave lived to be one hundred years of age and still not have been\r\ntechnically old.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing about her voice or manner that suggested a really\r\naged person. Senility was farther removed from her at ninety than from\r\nmost women at sixty. A California octogenarian was compiling a book of\r\npersonal testimonies by aged people and wrote to her asking for the\r\nsecret of her long life. Her answer was contained in four words, “Low\r\nfare, hard work.” If to this she had added anything, it should have\r\nbeen a self-forgetful purpose, a serene spirit, and an upholding faith.\r\n\r\nFrom her father Clara Barton inherited a spirit of broad philanthropy\r\nand wide human interest. From her mother she inherited a warm heart and\r\na very hot temper. It was this temper that gave her self-control. She\r\nkept it perfectly under her bidding, and that lowered voice was the\r\nsign of mighty resolution and smouldering passion under the control of\r\na conquering will.\r\n\r\nClara Barton was a lifelong believer in woman’s suffrage. She was a\r\nclose friend and a warm admirer of Susan B. Anthony, and shared her\r\naims and hopes for her sex. She believed in women receiving the same\r\nwages as men for the same work. She was never as militant an advocate\r\nof the rights of women as Miss Anthony, however. Temperamentally she\r\nwas of quite another disposition. In her later years she saw with\r\nmarked disapproval what she regarded as the unwomanly efforts of women\r\nto advance their cause. This she believed hurt the cause more than it\r\nhelped it, and whether it helped or hurt she did not like it.\r\n\r\nA lady who was about to undertake a long journey by rail spoke to Clara\r\nBarton of her dread of it. Railway travel, she said, always tired her\r\nout and made her sick. Miss Barton said, “Travel rests me.”\r\n\r\nHer friend asked her how she managed it. She replied:\r\n\r\n“I delegate to the conductor and the engineer the full responsibility\r\nfor the running of the train. I do not overeat, nor take with me candy\r\nor other needless food to upset my digestion just when I am getting\r\nless than my usual exercise. I carry with me a book and a note-book.\r\nWhen I think of something that I want to remember, I jot it down; when\r\nI see something that interests me, I make note of it. I read as long\r\nas I enjoy reading; and when I grow tired of that, I close my eyes and\r\nrest, and let the train go on.”\r\n\r\nHer friend replied, “That all sounds very simple; I will try it.”\r\n\r\nShe returned from her journey, reporting that she had had a delightful\r\ntime, and that she had alighted from the train at each end of the trip\r\nless weary than when she started.\r\n\r\nThe directions which Clara Barton gave were those which she herself had\r\ntested.\r\n\r\nClara Barton lived long, and her life had many changes. Account has\r\nbeen given of certain episodes in her young womanhood in which she was\r\nloved and did not return the affection of the men who loved her. The\r\nquestion has been asked and should be answered whether in her later\r\nyears she had any experience which made up for the lack of love in\r\nher youth. Some stories, nearly or quite apocryphal, have been told\r\nconcerning the men who are supposed to have loved her and whom she\r\nloved, but whom she refused because she loved her work more.\r\n\r\nThe lovers of her youth were all good, worthy men, as good as the\r\naverage New Englander. There is nothing to be said concerning any one\r\nof them that is not to his credit; but no one of them was the equal of\r\nClara Barton. There was no tragedy about her experience, neither was\r\nthere any consciousness of the ecstasy of a love completely possessing\r\nher. These affairs left her something of loneliness, but no memory of\r\nbitter grief or cruel disappointment. She could write, and did once\r\nwrite, some tender, sentimental verses about a sad parting, but the\r\nsadness did not break her heart, nor permanently cloud that of any of\r\nher lovers.\r\n\r\nThe time came when all this was changed. She lived in Washington, amid\r\na wide circle of friends, among them men of every station in life. No\r\nlonger was she possessed of ambition beyond that of any man of her\r\nage and acquaintance. There were men whom she knew and men whom she\r\nliked, who had ambitions equal to her own and ideals with which her\r\nown had much in common. During the Civil War she might have chosen any\r\none of scores of grateful men, as her husband. But she seems hardly\r\nto have given matrimony a thought in those years. After she became\r\nfamous, she was less readily accessible to any multitude of lovers,\r\nbut at least one man to whom she had been kind sought to reward her\r\nwith his heart and hand, and, after she had returned from Europe, at\r\nleast one man whom she met abroad pressed upon her his ardent and\r\nunrewarded affections. If she had married any one, she would have\r\nmarried an American. No offer of matrimony from a man not of her own\r\nland would seem to have made any appeal to her. This offer of marriage\r\nshe regarded rather with amusement than with serious consideration. It\r\nwas honorable, but in her judgment most unsuitable, and she refused\r\nwith a smile,--not the smile of contempt, but of good-humor and healthy\r\nmerriment.\r\n\r\nAmong other friends in middle life there were two whom she would seem\r\nto have considered in the aspect of possible lovers.\r\n\r\nIn the days during and following the Civil War, she came to know\r\nintimately an American professor of wide repute, who at that time was\r\npursuing extended researches in Washington. He was a widower of about\r\nher own age, a profound scholar, and he became a dear and trusted\r\nfriend. For several months their paths were thrown together and for\r\na time they boarded at the same table. She was interested, not only\r\nin his work, but in himself. The ardor and enthusiasm with which he\r\nworked impressed her. Like herself, he was little bound by precedent,\r\nand was engaged in a task which he confidently believed would increase\r\nthe sum of human learning. There was something in a task of this\r\ncharacter that made a direct appeal to Clara Barton. Much as she prized\r\nany kind of useful knowledge, she especially admired the spirit of\r\nthe pioneer, and honored the man who blazed new paths and widened the\r\nhorizons of learning. Such a man was this friend of hers. He read to\r\nher in many evenings the results of his investigation, and she shared\r\nhis enthusiasm for his task. Her two nephews, Bernard and Sam, then in\r\nWashington, were wont to poke quiet fun at him and to joke their aunt\r\nabout the possibility of his becoming an uncle of theirs and swamping\r\nthe family with his knowledge of subjects which the boys cared little\r\nabout. She took their raillery in good part. But one day, when she\r\nthought it had gone a little too far, she reproved her nephews and made\r\na spirited defense of the professor. She said, “You need not wonder\r\nthat, notwithstanding all your attempts to make fun of him, I admire\r\na man of his profound learning and high character.” Her nephews then\r\nbelieved that their respect for each other had merged into affection,\r\nbut, as the years went by and he and Clara gradually lost sight of\r\neach other, they came to think that they might have been mistaken,\r\nthat the two were good friends and nothing more. So far as the author\r\nis aware, there exists no evidence from which an answer can be had to\r\nthe question of how much they really cared for each other, or, if they\r\ncared, why they did not marry. The author has his own conjecture, and\r\nit is only a conjecture, but it is this: Both he and she were at that\r\ntime at the beginnings of a great work. How long either one would need\r\nto continue to labor and sacrifice before success was won, neither\r\ncould determine.\r\n\r\nThe last and in some respects the most interesting, as certainly the\r\nmost distinguished, among Clara Barton’s matrimonial possibilities,\r\ncame to her late in life. During the Civil War she became acquainted\r\nwith a man who even then was held in high regard, and was attracting\r\nthe attention of his own State and to some extent of the Nation. Rising\r\nlargely by his own exertions to a position of eminence, he became one\r\nof the leading men of the generation. Through all the years when she\r\nwas pursuing her war relief work, with scant appropriation for postage,\r\nhe cheerfully loaned her his frank and was her friend. Through many\r\nlong years they knew each other and always held each other in esteem.\r\nHe was in Washington and so was she, and there was little need of\r\ninterchange of letters between them; nor is there in the letters that\r\nare preserved any indication of personal affection. Those letters\r\ngrew out of particular events when one or the other of them was away\r\nfrom Washington, and for the most part they had no significance as\r\nindicating the extent to which they may have cared for each other.\r\n\r\nBut there came a time when his work and her work brought them into\r\nclose and more constant relations. They were both at the zenith of\r\ntheir respective careers. At that time he was a widower. Both were free\r\nand they could have married without the sacrifice of any important\r\ninterest. The home which they might have established would have been a\r\ncongenial one.\r\n\r\nAt that time Clara Barton took a brief vacation and went to Oxford\r\nwhere she prepared a new wardrobe, including a white satin dress. To\r\nher niece Mamie she confided that an occasion of unusual significance\r\nwas in prospect, and that more would be known of it later.\r\n\r\nJust at this time this distinguished statesman died. His death was a\r\ngreat shock to Clara Barton. She made no public lamentation; she never\r\nhinted even to those who were nearest to her that her grief was other\r\nthan that which she might properly feel for an honored friend of many\r\nyears. Her nieces believed that his death prevented their marriage. Her\r\nnephew, Stephen, says:\r\n\r\n Their friendship was long and intimate, and it would not have been\r\n strange if they had cared for each other. In many respects their lives\r\n would have been well adapted to each other. But if their regard for\r\n each other ever expressed itself in terms of love, or approached the\r\n prospect of marriage, I do not know it. It may have seemed to either\r\n or both of them a pleasant possibility, but they were mature people,\r\n each with a great work to do; and if his death cut short what was\r\n growing from friendship into love, I do not know it. Such a feeling\r\n either one of them might very worthily have held toward the other. I\r\n know that she held him as a dear and trusted and honored friend, and\r\n he esteemed her likewise.\r\n\r\nIf Clara Barton loved this able and good man, she bore her\r\ndisappointment as she was accustomed to bear her disappointments,\r\nin self-restrained and dignified silence. Her silence shall remain\r\nunbroken. If they loved, it was a love worthy of them both; if they\r\nwere good friends and only good friends, it was a friendship honorable\r\nto both.\r\n\r\nSo far as the author has been able to learn from those who were closest\r\nto Clara Barton during her lifetime, and so far as it is disclosed by\r\nher diary and letters, this is all there is to be known concerning the\r\nlove affairs of Clara Barton.\r\n\r\nThere were times when Clara Barton felt keenly her isolation. But, in\r\n1911, she recorded in her diary some of the domestic trials of some of\r\nher friends, and added, “After all, _Aloneness_ is not the worst thing\r\nin the world.”\r\n\r\nWhile extremely modest, Clara Barton was far from being a prude. She\r\nwas never terrified by appeals to respectability, nor could she be\r\nfrightened by any warning concerning men or women whom gossip condemned.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, when she was on her steamboat, _Joseph V. Throop_, assisting\r\nin the Ohio River floods, the boat one night tied up at a landing, and\r\na goodly number of people came on board. Among the rest were two young\r\nwomen. One of the prominent ladies of the town found opportunity to\r\nwhisper to her that these were young women whose social standing was\r\nnot above question. “Then they will need help all the more,” she said;\r\nand she gave those two girls an hour of her evening. Such warnings\r\nshe often received, and, far from accepting them as her basis of\r\ndiscrimination, she invariably reacted in the other direction.\r\n\r\nShe never undertook any work without first carefully thinking it\r\nthrough in an effort to discover just where it was to end and how it\r\nwas to be provided for. She had no sympathy with people who start good\r\nmovements for other people to support when their well-meant but poorly\r\nreckoned endeavor fails. “They get hold of a log they can’t lift,” she\r\nsaid, “and they make a great call for some one to come and lift it for\r\nthem.” That was never the way in which she did things. She thought them\r\nthrough in advance.\r\n\r\nClara Barton worked slowly. While she formed her decisions promptly in\r\nemergencies, she formulated them carefully and with painful precision.\r\nIt was not by doing things easily she accomplished so much, but by\r\nrising early and working late and keeping constantly at the thing she\r\nwanted to do. She attempted to use stenographic assistance, but with\r\nonly moderate success. She had to work out her letters and addresses\r\nin her own way. A certain kind of routine work her secretaries did for\r\nher, to her great relief, but her real work she had to do herself.\r\n\r\nShe coveted the ability to work more rapidly. She admired that ability,\r\nand perhaps overvalued it, in others. She once wrote to me: “Where do\r\nyou find time to do so many things? One of the griefs of my life is to\r\nsee other persons getting things done--really _done_--and I accomplish\r\nso little. I don’t see how they do it.”\r\n\r\nNo more could they see how she did it; but she did it by working with\r\nan industry and devotion that never found an easy way of accomplishing\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nA friend of hers was deeply interested in a movement for which he\r\nwished the endorsement of Clara Barton. She believed in the work he was\r\ndoing, and was willing to commend it; but she wanted to know a little\r\nmore about it, and then she wanted time to think out what she wanted\r\nto say about it. He became very desirous of having her commendation\r\nin time for a particular use; and his wife invited Clara Barton to\r\ntheir home to dine. She willingly accepted, and enjoyed the visit. She\r\nknew the family, and held them in high esteem. After dinner, and some\r\nconversation, the man produced a typewritten statement of some length\r\nwhich he had prepared, endorsing his work. This he read to her, and she\r\nliked it. But when she understood that he had prepared this for her to\r\nsign, she was shocked. She refused to sign it.\r\n\r\nHer friend could not at first understand her scruples. Did she not\r\nbelieve in this work? She did. Had she not expressed to him her\r\napproval and signified her willingness to furnish him a statement which\r\nhe would be at liberty to publish? She had. Had she not listened to his\r\nreading of this very statement with expressions of hearty approval?\r\nShe had. Was there anything in it she would like to change? If so, she\r\nwas at liberty to make any erasure or interlineation she desired. No;\r\nthere was nothing she cared to change, except that she cared to change\r\neverything in it.\r\n\r\nHe assured her that he was asking nothing of her which men of the\r\nhighest honor did not do constantly; that in a busy world people had\r\nto avail themselves of assistance such as he offered her; that his own\r\nstandards of honor were high, and he would never think of asking her\r\nto sign a statement which did not fully express her own convictions.\r\n\r\nAll this she understood, and she did not censure him. But she could\r\nnot do what he asked of her. The statement which he had prepared was\r\nnot hers. The opinions expressed were in full accord with her own, and\r\nthe language was as good as any she could have chosen, and there was\r\nnothing in the document to which she could object; but it was not hers.\r\n\r\nHer idea of a document which she could sign as her own was one which\r\nshe should have thought out on first wakening, perhaps in the middle\r\nof the night, and sketched in pencil on the pages of the little pad at\r\nthe head of her bed, and then thoughtfully copied in her own hand with\r\ncareful weighing of each word and phrase. That would have been her own.\r\n\r\nCertainly that was a needlessly narrow conception of the extent to\r\nwhich she might honorably have employed the minds and willing hands of\r\nothers in her own too heavy toil. But it was a conception grounded in\r\nthe highest possible conviction of honor.\r\n\r\nClara Barton was a self-willed woman. So was Mother Bickerdyke. So was\r\nDorothea Dix. So, most emphatically and uncomfortably for those who\r\nwithstood her, was Florence Nightingale. If comparisons were in order,\r\nwhich they certainly are not, she was not the least considerate of the\r\nfour of other people’s opinion, nor most reluctant to admit herself in\r\nthe wrong. Like Florence Nightingale, she had opportunities of marriage\r\nin her youth, and resolutely turned to other work under force of a\r\nstrong conviction, and that conviction had mighty impelling power.\r\nLytton Strachey, in his remarkably penetrating sketch, says:\r\n\r\n Every one knows the popular conception of Florence Nightingale.\r\n The saintly, self-sacrificing woman, the delicate maiden of high\r\n degree who threw aside the pleasures of a life of ease to succor the\r\n afflicted, the Lady with the Lamp, gliding through the horrors of\r\n the hospital at Scutari, and consecrating with the radiance of her\r\n goodness the dying soldier’s couch--the vision is familiar to all.\r\n But the truth was different. The Miss Nightingale of fact was not as\r\n facile as fancy painted her. She worked in another fashion, and toward\r\n another end; she moved under the stress of an impetus which finds no\r\n place in the popular imagination. A Demon possessed her. Now demons,\r\n whatever else they may be, are full of interest. And so it happens\r\n that in the real Miss Nightingale there was more that was interesting\r\n than in the legendary one; there was also less that was agreeable.\r\n\r\nThe disposition of Florence Nightingale lacked much of being angelic.\r\nWhen she encountered the stupidity of official red-tape or the\r\nbrutality and indifference of army surgeons, her words blistered.\r\nShe hurled invectives and she employed sarcastic nicknames, and she\r\ndenounced everything and everybody who opposed her. But when she\r\narrived in Scutari forty-two wounded men out of every hundred were\r\ndying, and when she left them her hospitals showed a death-rate of\r\ntwenty-two out of every thousand. Clara Barton had a tongue less sharp\r\nthan Florence Nightingale’s, but she had a will no less inflexible.\r\nBoth women had soft voices, which they never raised. Men fled from the\r\nsoft tones and vitriolic words of Florence Nightingale. When Clara\r\nBarton grew angry, she lowered her voice. Instead of a woman’s shrill\r\nfalsetto, men heard a deep and determined tone quietly affirming that\r\nthe thing was to be done in this way and in no other. Few men withstood\r\nthat tone.\r\n\r\nSome readers of this book, I am sure, have been shocked to read the\r\nopinion of Dr. Bellows of the Sanitary Commission concerning the\r\nuselessness and worse of the ordinary woman nurse in war hospitals.\r\nThat opinion was shared by Dorothea Dix, by Clara Barton, and to an\r\neven greater degree by Florence Nightingale.\r\n\r\nNot very long after Florence Nightingale had reached Scutari with her\r\nthirty-eight nurses, and about the time when she was having to ship\r\nsome of them back, her official friends in England thought to win her\r\neternal gratitude by sending to her forty-six additional nurses, under\r\nthe personal direction of her old friend, Miss Stanley. But she refused\r\nto accept them, and sent in her resignation. She would not have these\r\n“women scampering through the wards” and upsetting all her regulations.\r\n“They are like troublesome children,” she said. Even the religious\r\nones were given to what she called “spiritual flirtations” with the\r\nsoldiers; and, as for those who had not the fear of God or the dread\r\nof hell-fire, there were drunken orderlies and dissolute officers and\r\nunmarried chaplains to be considered.\r\n\r\nI have wondered what Dorothea Dix would have said if forty-six nurses\r\nnot of her selection had been suddenly dumped upon her; I think she\r\nwould have gone into hysterics and shipped them all back. Clara Barton,\r\nI believe, would have set them to emptying slops and scrubbing floors\r\ntill she found the few out of whom she could make nurses. She would not\r\nhave written the kind of letters about them which Florence Nightingale\r\nwrote. She would have scolded a little in her diary, and have written\r\nthe committee who had sent them a letter of thanks, requesting them\r\nnot to send any more until she asked for them, and meantime to send\r\nher some bandages and some lemons. But she would have felt much as\r\nFlorence Nightingale felt. They were both self-willed women. They\r\nneeded all their will-power. It was well they had it.\r\n\r\nMany interesting parallels suggest themselves between the work of Clara\r\nBarton and that of Florence Nightingale.\r\n\r\nThey were contemporary in a remarkable degree. Florence Nightingale was\r\na few months the older and died a few months sooner than Clara Barton,\r\nbut both lived to be more than ninety years of age. Miss Nightingale\r\nwas born May 12, 1820, and died August 13, 1910; Clara Barton was born\r\nDecember 25, 1821, and died April 12, 1912. They faced the question\r\nof marriage in much the same fashion, and each one gave herself in\r\nmuch the same spirit to her life-task. They were not unlike in their\r\nreligious faith and in its practical expression. The long, confidential\r\nletters of Florence Nightingale, written painfully when she ought\r\nto have been in bed, remind us of the detailed epistles which Clara\r\nBarton found time to write, mostly late at night. Each had a love of\r\nhumor which stood her in good stead; Miss Barton’s had less sting in\r\nit than that of Miss Nightingale, but otherwise it was not unlike,\r\nand it was a great help to both of them. Each had a gentle voice, and\r\neach knew how to use it effectively without raising it. Each protested\r\nto the end of her life that her real work was not that of the popular\r\nimagination, that of personally ministering to any considerable number\r\nof sick or wounded soldiers, but a work of direction and organization;\r\nand neither succeeded in making the public believe it. Not long before\r\nher death, Clara Barton relieved her mind in her diary concerning the\r\nsort of newspaper article which invented fairy-tales of this sort:\r\n“Oh, these women reporters!” she said in her diary. “They never get\r\nanything right. They are forever telling and inventing the same old\r\nkind of gush!” Florence Nightingale also had a profound distrust of the\r\nlimitations of members of her own sex; but also she knew, as did Clara\r\nBarton, the brutality, the stupidity, and the inefficiency of men.\r\nMiss Nightingale often wondered if there were in all the army enough\r\nofficers of sympathy and conscience to have saved Sodom. Sometimes she\r\ndoubted if there was one.\r\n\r\nAll the women who went to the battle-front and were worth their\r\ncarfare were women of strong will. Mother Bickerdyke, in her rough\r\nand great-hearted way, was a lady; but when she faced an incompetent\r\nsurgeon and drove him out of the hospital and he appealed to General\r\nSherman, the General confessed himself powerless: “She ranks me,” he\r\nsaid. Dorothea Dix was a lady to the very depth of her sensitive soul,\r\na devoted, consecrated Christian lady; but she could be very properly\r\ndisagreeable on occasion, and she brooked no interference with her\r\nauthority. Florence Nightingale was a lady, born and bred; but vitriol\r\nwas mild compared to some of her outbursts. Clara Barton was a lady\r\nto her very finger-tips; and she had had enough of experience in\r\nWashington among officials and men of influence so that she knew how on\r\noccasion to be much more diplomatic and gracious than most other women\r\nwith her responsibilities. Moreover, she shrank from giving pain, and\r\nwas careful of her words. But she had as strong a will as had Florence\r\nNightingale, and, while she was as a rule more amiable than that lady\r\nin her more violent moods, she got things done. People sometimes found\r\nher arbitrary, impatient, and obstinate; had she been less so, it had\r\ngone hard with the interests which she cherished. She was capable of\r\nbeing arbitrary, impatient, and obstinate, and the same is true of each\r\nof the other women whom her name calls to mind. But among them she was\r\nnot the least gentle, considerate, and self-forgetful. She required\r\nthat things should move, and move in the direction of her decision; but\r\nshe was at heart, and on most occasions in her demeanor, quiet, gentle,\r\naffectionate, and calm.\r\n\r\nClara Barton had many devoted and loyal friends. They were held by her\r\nin warm and enduring affection; and some of them, for her sake and her\r\nwork’s sake, made generous sacrifices. She had other friends who came\r\nto her in bursts of generous enthusiasm. These also were in good part\r\nsincere, and if some of them found her habits so simple and her task so\r\nheavy as to afford them smaller share than they had hoped in personal\r\nassociation with her, they were none the less generally firm in their\r\nfriendship. It was not to be expected that every one could live\r\npermanently on her high plane of single-mindedness. Some of her friends\r\nwere a trial to her, for it was not easy for her to understand why,\r\nwhen they once knew the task she was working at, they did not manifest\r\nstability of purpose and perseverance in well-doing. But these she\r\ncounted her friends. When one of these left her roof because the fare\r\nwas too plain, Clara Barton said, “She is not willing to wash herself\r\nseven times in Jordan.”\r\n\r\nThere were others--and in the course of her long life there were a\r\nnumber of them--who came to her with ardent protestations of affection\r\nand of devotion to her cause, who in time wearied of the strain, or\r\nresented her strong hand in management, or who came to believe that\r\nthey themselves could do better the work which she had undertaken. Some\r\nof them betrayed her most sacred confidences, and returned her evil for\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nFew women were so ill-fitted by nature to bear this kind of\r\ndisappointment as Clara Barton. She was morbidly sensitive, and given\r\nto self-accusation. How unworthy she must be, she thought, if these\r\npersons did not continue to love her. The wounds of their defection\r\nwent unhealed. Yet here was one of the finest triumphs of her nature.\r\nShe never cherished permanent resentment.\r\n\r\nOne time a friend of hers recalled to her a peculiarly cruel thing that\r\nhad been done to her some years previous, and Clara Barton did not seem\r\nto understand what she was talking about.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you remember the wrong that was done you?” she was asked.\r\n\r\nThoughtfully and calmly she answered, “No; I distinctly remember\r\nforgetting that.”\r\n\r\nFriends deserted Clara Barton, but she never deserted a friend. If\r\na friend of hers was evil-spoken against, that only increased her\r\nloyalty. She would not believe evil unless compelled to do so, and, if\r\ncompelled, she interpreted the wrong, if possible, in terms of charity.\r\nOnly baseness and treachery and betrayal of trust won her scorn.\r\n\r\nAt one time, in connection with her relief work on the rivers, a man\r\nwho had acted as her local agent was arrested for burglary. She was at\r\na distance and wires were down. She refused to believe him guilty.\r\nWhen later details made it impossible to doubt that he had done\r\nessentially the deed with which he was charged, she still believed that\r\nthere must be some explanation. Later it developed that the offense was\r\ntechnical, and grew out of a dispute as to the ownership of certain\r\npremises which he had entered, and the other claimant, instead of\r\nsuing him for trespass, sought to do him the greater injury by having\r\nhim arrested for burglary. How the question of the ownership of the\r\nproperty was ultimately settled, I do not know, but her confidence in\r\nthe man as one incapable of willful crime was justified.\r\n\r\nConsul-General Hitz, of Switzerland, long her friend, became a banker\r\nin Washington. Apparently he had little talent for the banking\r\nbusiness, and undertook to finance the Swedenborgian Church, of which\r\nhe was a member, out of the revenues of the bank. Of his guilt before\r\nthe law there appears to have been no question; as to his essential\r\nhonesty Clara Barton had no doubt. She did not condone the offense,\r\nnor question that the amount taken must be made good; but she did not\r\nbelieve that so good a man and so true a friend ought to remain in\r\nprison. After high influence had been exercised unavailingly on his\r\nbehalf, she persisted, and he was released.\r\n\r\nHer voice has already been mentioned. Its key was about the average\r\npitch of a woman’s treble voice. In conversation it was flexible, and\r\nvery pleasant. On the platform it was clear and penetrating. Her tones\r\nwere not musical, but were distinctly agreeable. Her inflections were\r\nthose of the gentlewoman of the old school. There was a soothing,\r\nconciliatory, almost caressing quality in her voice. It had no\r\nharsh notes. It was diametrically opposite to all that was harsh and\r\nstrident. It was gentle, winsome, and in every accent suggestive of\r\ncourtesy and good-breeding. When she lived abroad, no one accused her\r\nof a high, harsh, nasal American voice. It was a New England voice, but\r\nas soft as that of any Southern lady of the old days.\r\n\r\nBut when Clara Barton grew very much in earnest, her voice changed.\r\nThat change was one of the most remarkable things about her. It did not\r\nrise. It did not grow harsh or self-asserting. It dropped a half octave\r\nor, as it sometimes seemed, a full octave. It was a deep, full voice.\r\nIt was almost bass. Her eyes darkened as her voice went down, and\r\nflashed lightning to her tones’ quiet thunder. She had a temper, which\r\nshe kept well under control, but when she spoke in a low tone, those\r\nwho heard her knew that its fires were red.\r\n\r\nShe was modest in her dress, but she had an eye for bright colors. In\r\nher youth she was a painter, and she learned how to mix colors on her\r\npalette. She never felt so sure of her good taste in the matter of\r\ndress as she did of her ability to make pleasing contrasts on canvas.\r\nShe trusted much to the good judgment of her friend, Annie Childs. When\r\nshe followed her own judgment, she inclined to green, which she loved\r\nto set off with red. Red was her color, and she said, the Barton rose\r\nwas the Red Rose, all the way from the Wars of the Roses down. She\r\nloved red roses. She loved red apples. She liked to wear red ribbons\r\nand trimmings. With a background of green, red was always safe. In her\r\nyouth and young womanhood she often determined to vary her costume,\r\nand repeatedly went to the stores determined to buy something beside\r\ngreen. Her nieces said, “If Aunt Clara says she is going to town to buy\r\na brown dress, we know that she will buy a brown dress; for Aunt Clara\r\ninvariably does exactly what she says she will do. So we know that she\r\nwill select and pay for a brown dress. But we also know that by the\r\ntime she gets it home the color will have changed; when she opens the\r\npackage, it is sure to have become green.”\r\n\r\nIn later years, dressmakers took her in hand, and widened the range\r\nof her choice. But she seldom appeared in any gown that did not lend\r\nitself to a little dash of red; and when she wore just what delighted\r\nher own eyes, her dress was green, with a complementary dash of red.\r\n\r\nSomething must be said about her habit of economy, and it must be said\r\nwith some care lest it give a very wrong impression. Clara Barton was\r\neconomical to a very marked degree. If a list of her actual economies\r\nwere here given, it would produce on many minds the impression that she\r\nwas stingy. This would be wide of the truth. If a valid distinction\r\nmay be made between two words that are nearly synonymous, she was\r\nparsimonious, but was not penurious.\r\n\r\nShe was reared in a community and in a family where want was unknown,\r\nbut where money was earned by hard work, and capital was accumulated\r\nby thrift and economy. It was part of her birthright and of her\r\nbeing. There was about her nothing that inclined her to waste or even\r\nextravagance.\r\n\r\nShe entered into life early as a teacher, at first at a small salary.\r\nShe had opportunity to save, and she did save. Her necessary expenses\r\nwere small, and she began at the outset to save money. She continued\r\nto save money. She had good business judgment, and, excepting for a few\r\ntimes when she permitted her sympathies or her friendships to get the\r\nbetter of that judgment, her investments, conservatively made, were\r\nremunerative.\r\n\r\nWhen she first went abroad in 1869, she knew that she had money enough\r\nto support her as long as she lived. If she recovered her health, the\r\nlecture platform was still open to her, and she could earn and save\r\nabove all expenses from four thousand dollars to six thousand dollars\r\na year. If she returned an invalid, she had the income on about thirty\r\nthousand dollars, which was more than she needed. In no year of her\r\nlife, probably, did she spend upon herself as much as eighteen hundred\r\ndollars. Even when she traveled abroad, her expenses were moderate,\r\nand she never drew on her principal for her own support. But eighteen\r\nhundred dollars or two thousand dollars a year, which was about what\r\nher investments brought her, did not invite reckless extravagance, She\r\nknew that she must exercise reasonable economy, and her tastes were\r\nsuch that this was no hardship.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, she sat up at night rather than take a sleeping-car,\r\nit was not wholly that she was unwilling to pay for the price of the\r\nberth. She had been accustomed to doing so until an attempt was made\r\nto rob her, after which she was greatly disinclined to the use of the\r\nsleeper. Her prime reason for sitting up was that she disliked sleepers\r\nafter that night. But she was not at all averse to saving two dollars.\r\nShe slept few hours in the night, and was accustomed to sleeping under\r\nunfavorable conditions. She thought she rested quite as well sitting\r\nin a corner of her seat as lying in a stuffy and dark berth.\r\n\r\nHer lunch at home was often a few crackers and a red apple, and the\r\nmore nearly she regulated her diet when journeying in accordance with\r\nher custom at home, the better life went with her. So her bag often\r\ncontained a little package of the kind of crackers which she liked,\r\nand one or more big red apples. If she sat in her seat and ate these,\r\nit was not primarily because she was unwilling to pay a dollar for\r\nher lunch; she had the dollar, and she had no ambition to leave any\r\nconsiderable sum of money behind her when she died. On the other hand,\r\nshe was not unmindful of the good she could do with the dollar in some\r\nother way. And she did that good with it. She was parsimonious with\r\nherself; she was generous toward others.\r\n\r\nTo enumerate her economies would misrepresent her. It would seem that\r\nshe was niggardly. The contrary was true. She abhorred waste. She could\r\nnot tolerate extravagance. But she could draw her last dollar, and\r\ndid draw her last dollar from investment, to put into her search for\r\nmissing soldiers, and she could do it and did do it without whining and\r\nwithout fear. Even the possibility that she might die a pauper did not\r\nterrify her or win from her in her diary any more than a half-mirthful\r\nrecognition. She economized in things she did not greatly care for that\r\nshe might do the things that were to her of supreme importance.\r\n\r\nShe did not hoard money. The amount which she had at the end of her\r\nlecturing career, she did not greatly increase, nor, until she got deep\r\ninto the work of the Red Cross, did it materially diminish. In order\r\nto support the Red Cross work in its earlier stages, she drew upon\r\nher principal, and she did not to the end of her life restore it to\r\nwhat it had been before. But she never complained of this, nor did it\r\nin the least worry her. Year by year she had sufficient income, with\r\nreasonable economy, to supply all her needs. Now and then she delivered\r\nan address and received a hundred dollars. Occasionally she replied\r\nto a request of newspaper or magazine for an article, and received a\r\ncheck in return. For a year she received a salary from the State of\r\nMassachusetts as matron of the Reformatory for Women at Sherborn. The\r\nannuity paid to her by the Massachusetts General Hospital gave her a\r\nlittle more margin. She was free from worry as to her own finances.\r\nI have not found in her diary or her letters a single sentence in\r\nwhich she expressed anxiety about her own financial future. There were\r\nseveral times when she was not sure what she ought to do next, and\r\nin her decisions she was not unmindful of financial necessities. But\r\nshe did not keep in constant thought her own need of saving money for\r\nherself. She saved, because it was natural for her to save, and because\r\nshe had causes at heart which she wished to save for.\r\n\r\nCareful in her expenditures upon herself, Clara Barton lavished her\r\nlove upon others. She cherished her friends, and there was little that\r\nshe was not willing to do for them. More than once she jeopardized\r\nplans of her own for the sake of unselfish ministry to others, some of\r\nwhom had little claim upon her. She received under her own roof, fed at\r\nher table, sheltered at her fireside, and assisted from her purse not\r\na few people who later proved ungrateful; indeed, those who wrought\r\nher most pain were those whom she had befriended and of whom she later\r\nlearned that they sought not her, but hers.\r\n\r\nYet it would not be fair to give any impression that the number of\r\ningrates among her companions was large. Relatively, it was small.\r\nThose who loved her loved with a fervent loyalty; and there are few\r\nthings more beautiful than the adoring and grateful affection which\r\nthose bestow upon her memory who knew her longest and best. A strong\r\nindividualist, she inspired in those who came to know her well that\r\nperfect confidence and grateful devotion which are the crowning test of\r\nleadership. There were those, who, for her sake and that of any cause\r\nwhich she held dear, would have gone with her singing to the stake, and\r\nshe would never have permitted one of them to go there unless she went\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nThe author was her relative, her friend of many years. He loved her\r\nand admired her; but he has felt his own praises weaken and pale and\r\ndisappear in the presence of those who, working in intimate association\r\nwith her through the years, proclaimed to him her virtues in terms that\r\nbut for their sincerity and the knowledge of those who spoke would have\r\nseemed extravagant. The surest proof of her genuine goodness is the\r\nunfaltering devotion of those who knew her best, and for that reason\r\nloved her most.\r\n\r\nClara Barton was a woman of tact. She needed all the tact she had\r\nand more. In every field in which she labored, she was flooded with\r\nvolunteer workers who wanted to help. Some of them were competent; more\r\nwere not. I recently talked with my long-time friend, Father Field,\r\nsometime head of the Cowley Fathers, and learned that he was at the\r\nJohnstown flood, and saw much of Clara Barton. They rode together in\r\na buggy over a road filled with trees and house-roofs and he feared\r\nshe would be thrown out, but she told him to drive on; she had driven\r\nover worse roads, and with bullets besides. He said that her greatest\r\ndifficulty as he saw it there was the number of people of good impulse\r\nbut little discretion who rushed into Johnstown to help. Dr. Bellows\r\nsaid a blunt word about the women who made their journey to the\r\nbattle-field, that most of them were in the way. This was unfortunately\r\ntrue of many of the well-meaning people who rushed to the assistance of\r\nClara Barton in time of flood or fire. Assistance she must have, and\r\nmust take what was offered. But the handling of this untrained force\r\nwas a matter which called for the greatest tact as well as executive\r\nability.\r\n\r\nNot only so, but, when the work in a particular field was over, there\r\nwere always those who had come as volunteer workers who insisted on\r\nbestowing themselves upon Clara Barton to make Red Cross work their\r\nlife-work. Some of them were competent, and she was glad of them. But\r\nin the course of her years of experience she accumulated a series of\r\nmisfit volunteer assistants, some of whom it was not easy afterward to\r\nget rid of.\r\n\r\nShe had little love of music. She did not sing or play any musical\r\ninstrument. When traveling abroad, if forced to attend the opera, she\r\nsaved the time from utter waste by writing a home letter while singers\r\nof world-wide repute performed and sang before her. Having a low and\r\nsoft voice, she disliked the high notes of women’s voices. Good,\r\nmelodious quartet music she heard with mild enjoyment, and if she can\r\nbe said to have liked any music it was that of male voices. A chorus\r\nof men always pleased her. Some of the war songs always thrilled her,\r\nthough more for the associations than the music. There was one song,\r\npopular during the later years of the Civil War, which she never heard\r\noften enough. It was the song of an old slave, who, dying years before\r\nthe war, had believed that he would rise on the day when freedom came\r\nto his race. The author also remembers it, as it was taught to him\r\nalmost before he could walk:\r\n\r\n  Nicodemus the slave was of African birth,\r\n    He was bought for a bagful of gold;\r\n  He was reckoned as part of the salt of the earth,\r\n    And he died years ago, very old.\r\n  ’Twas the last word he said as we laid him away\r\n    In the stump of an old hollow tree,--\r\n  “Wake me up,” was his charge, “at the first break of day,\r\n    Wake me up for the great jubilee.”\r\n\r\n  _Chorus_:\r\n\r\n  Then run and tell Elijah to hurry up, Pomp,\r\n  To meet us at the gum-tree down in the swamp,\r\n            To wake Nicodemus to-day.\r\n\r\nIt was sung at the minstrel shows after the Emancipation Proclamation;\r\nbut it was not as a minstrel show song that Clara Barton enjoyed it.\r\nThere was a solemn dignity about the old slave’s faith that inspired\r\nher; and the authoritative tones of the words “Wake Nicodemus” thrilled\r\nher through and through.\r\n\r\nHer lack of love of music reached its climax in her abhorrence of\r\npiano-drumming. For piano music she had some little love, but not\r\nenough to compensate for the annoyance for having a piano where it\r\ncould be pounded by any visitor, skilled or unskilled. For many years\r\nshe refused to have a piano in her house. At last she permitted one\r\nto be procured, and she gave it house-room, and sometimes heard it\r\nplayed with satisfaction. But when she was hard at work and wanted to\r\nconcentrate her thought, she found no joy in the thoughtless hammering\r\nwhich an open piano seemed to invite. There was a time for all things,\r\neven for piano-playing, and in its proper time and place she could\r\npermit it and enjoy a part of it; but she did not want the menace of\r\nit from early morn till dewy eve and several hours thereafter. Her\r\nhome was a very open place of entertainment, and she could not well\r\ninquire, before admitting a person who needed shelter, what were his\r\nor her habits and ability with respect to the torture of piano keys.\r\nSo she would have preferred a home with only such music as was brought\r\nin where,and when it was wanted. But she accepted the piano as in some\r\nsort inevitable, and it did not annoy her as much as she had expected.\r\n\r\nIf Clara Barton did not care for music, she did dearly love poetry.\r\nFrom her earliest childhood she was reading it, committing it to\r\nmemory, copying it, and writing original lines of her own. There lies\r\nbefore me, as I write, her first copy-book. The strokes and curves\r\nshe learned to imitate are there, then the letters, lower case and\r\ncapitals, then the first words, “thoughtful,” “Nation,” and “National,”\r\nand the sentence, chosen perhaps for its varied arrangement of letters\r\nwith the simplest stem and curve, and partly because it was not well\r\nfor a New England child at school to begin life with any illusion about\r\nits essential character, “Man was made to mourn.”\r\n\r\nWho was the teacher who set her these copies we do not know, but\r\nshe copied them well. The first poetic lines that she was given to\r\ntranscribe were these, melodious but not precisely soothing to the\r\njuvenile mind:\r\n\r\n  Then rose the cry of females, shrill,\r\n  As goss-hawks whistle on the hill,\r\n  Denouncing misery and ill,\r\n  Mingled with childhood’s bubbling thrill\r\n        Of curses stammered slow;\r\n  Answering, with imprecation dread,\r\n  “Sunk be his home in embers red,\r\n  And cursed be the meanest shed\r\n  That e’er shall hide his houseless head\r\n        We doom to want and woe!”\r\n\r\nThis was rather strong sentiment for a timid and sympathetic little\r\ngirl, and she would probably have shuddered at it in prose; but in\r\nverse she probably committed it to memory as she was in process of\r\ncopying it.\r\n\r\nThis completed the childhood work, and the book is filled, in her more\r\nmature hand, with complete poems, “The Pilgrim Fathers,--where are\r\nthey?” “The Burial of Arnold,” “The Hour of Prayer,” “Warren at Bunker\r\nHill,” “The Indian’s Lament,” “The Fall of Tecumseh,” and other poems,\r\nheroic, patriotic, devotional, and ending with “Farewell to the Bride.”\r\n\r\nLater she procured a bound volume, and in it she copied her favorite\r\npoems, and wrote others of her own, in her most careful and painstaking\r\nhand. Her “copper-plate” penmanship was never more exquisite than in\r\nthis volume, in which her own poems and the poems she loved are written\r\nin order as she found or composed them.\r\n\r\nNo quality in Clara Barton was more marked than the breadth of her\r\nsympathies. She shuddered at the thought of needless pain. I have a\r\ncrude little picture, a page out of a child’s book, which she found\r\nin her childhood and preserved to the end of her life. It is entitled\r\n“What came of firing a gun.” A dead bird lies on the ground, and is\r\napproached on the one side by a boy with a gun in his hand and on the\r\nother by a horrified girl. It is not a great work of art, but it tells\r\nits story and conveys its lesson.\r\n\r\nShe never gave needless pain. She regarded all life as akin to the life\r\nof God, and sacred with the imprint of God’s own image. She looked upon\r\nall life that can suffer or enjoy, the life of bird and beast and fish,\r\nas something on which it is a sin to inflict needless pain.\r\n\r\nFrom the time she saw, in her little girlhood, the killing of an ox,\r\nand felt that the blow that struck and crushed its skull had struck her\r\nown head, she never saw pain without feeling it. She could have said\r\nwith Whitman of the suffering she saw--\r\n\r\n  My wounds on me grow livid as I lean\r\n      Upon my staff and look.\r\n\r\nShe did not merely sympathize with suffering; she suffered. She not\r\nonly was glad of other people’s joy; it was her joy. She rejoiced with\r\nthose that did rejoice and wept with those that wept. Not often do her\r\ndiaries record her weeping; and the tears she records as having shed\r\nare oftener for others’ sorrows than for her own. Her sympathy was\r\ngenuine, and of the sort which can truly be called vicarious. She took\r\nit upon herself.\r\n\r\nHer sympathies were so strong that she would have been useless in\r\nthe presence of danger and pain but for her remarkable self-control.\r\nI asked her once how she acquired this, and she said it was simply\r\nby forgetting herself. She saw something that needed to be done, and\r\nwent about the doing of it so promptly, so completely absorbed by the\r\nnecessity of it, that she forgot to be horrified by the sight of blood,\r\nforgot to faint as timid females were supposed to do. Days and weeks\r\nand months and years of it she would endure and never once give way.\r\nThen would come a revulsion and a horror and a weakness and a collapse.\r\nAgain and again she held herself in hand through nervous strain that\r\nwould have crushed most women or men, and when it was all over went\r\nnervously to pieces.\r\n\r\nIt appears a pity that, being capable of maintaining her self-control\r\ntill the end of the crisis, she could not still have maintained it when\r\nthe need was over. But it was a part of her delicately strung organism\r\nto bear any manner of strain while the need lasted, and then to snap.\r\nThe remarkable fact is, not that she ultimately gave way, but that she\r\nendured so long and so much.\r\n\r\nClara Barton was a woman to her finger-tips. Nothing that she saw or\r\nsuffered ever coarsened her or made her oblivious to the finer things\r\nof life. Nothing that came of her association with men--and rough\r\nmen at that--made her anything less than a woman and a lady. She was\r\ndistinctly feminine. She had her own way of ignoring any incident\r\noccurring in her presence at which she might have been expected to\r\nbe shocked, but of stickling at any trivial act which implied that\r\nshe was indifferent to proprieties. Teamsters, with their wagons deep\r\nto the hubs in mud, might swear at their mules and she would never\r\nhear it; but at night by the camp-fire she could rebuke with a quiet\r\nand effective word or look the slightest approach to impropriety\r\nof word or deed. She was no prude when she had a duty to perform,\r\nand conventionalities meant little to her in the presence of human\r\nneed. But on her return to home life, she was gentle, ladylike, and a\r\nstickler for proprieties.\r\n\r\nShe had no love for the mannish woman. She was much in the society\r\nof men. In many respects she preferred the society of men to that of\r\nwomen. She entered into their joys and experiences appreciatively. But\r\nin it all she was distinctly feminine. She was a woman always, a lady\r\nalways. People who expected to meet in her a big, aggressive female,\r\nwith a long stride and a heavy voice and a domineering attitude, were\r\namazed. She was a little, undemonstrative gentlewoman of the old school.\r\n\r\nOne of Clara Barton’s most outstanding qualities was her almost\r\ncomplete disregard of precedent. The fact that a thing had always been\r\ndone in a given way was evidence to her that it could be done again in\r\nthat fashion, but was of almost no value to her as proving that that\r\nwas the best way to do it. She always had faith in the possibility of\r\nsomething better. It irritated her to be told how things always had\r\nbeen done. She knew that a very large proportion of things that have\r\nbeen done since the creation have been blunderingly done, and she was\r\nalways ready to listen to suggestions of better ways. Having once\r\ndecided upon a course that defied the tyranny of precedent, she held\r\ntrue to her declaration of independence, and saw her experiment through.\r\n\r\nIn this she was not reckless or iconoclastic. She simply forbade\r\nherself the cheap luxury of a closed mind. If no better way presented\r\nitself, she was content with the old way of doing. But she was\r\neager for any new thing that might improve upon the past. Hers was\r\npreëminently a forward-looking mind and a soul with face ever toward\r\nthe sunrise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nCLARA BARTON’S LAST YEARS\r\n\r\n\r\nClara Barton lived for eight years after her retirement from the Red\r\nCross. After her first disappointment and the giving-up of her dream\r\nof exile in Mexico, her heart turned to a form of work which already\r\nhad been much upon her mind. In establishing the American Red Cross,\r\nshe had determined from the outset that it should be of use in peace\r\nas well as in war. The conviction grew upon her that it should be\r\nbroadened still further so that its activities should not be confined\r\nto periods of calamity, but that there should be established under its\r\ndirection various forms of community service. Particularly did she\r\ndesire that in every community there should be organizations for home\r\nnursing and first aid to the injured.\r\n\r\nBefore her retirement from the Red Cross, she had proposed to her\r\nassociates the addition of a First Aid Department as a part of its\r\nactivities. This did not seem to her board of control an advisable\r\nfield for the Red Cross to enter at that time. After her resignation\r\nfrom the presidency of the American Red Cross, she organized the\r\n“National First Aid Association of America,” which was incorporated\r\nunder the laws of the District of Columbia and had its general office\r\nin Boston. The plan included a large sustaining membership with a\r\nnominal fee of a dollar a year, and an active membership composed of\r\nthose in every community who attended a course of lectures and passed a\r\nphysical examination.\r\n\r\nThe plan of this new organization, as originally planned by her for the\r\nRed Cross, was fully set forth in a brief manuscript which she prepared:\r\n\r\n During the entire period of the present differences among sections of\r\n the members of the American National Red Cross, I have never once felt\r\n that it was the desire of the American people that I should personally\r\n enter within the circle of disturbance, and I have consequently\r\n remained a silent and sorrowful spectator of a controversy that\r\n appeared to me to be leading where no true, loyal friend of the Red\r\n Cross would care to follow.\r\n\r\n Every effort I have ever made on behalf of the people of the United\r\n States, during the long years of my work, has been met with friendly\r\n approval or thoughtful response. These efforts have always been made\r\n on behalf of suffering humanity, in times of dire distress and peril,\r\n and I have administered with a free but careful hand the benefactions\r\n of whatever nature that have been entrusted to me; and as freely I\r\n have given of all I possessed of strength, health, and private means.\r\n\r\n Never once have I made a suggestion on behalf of myself or my\r\n difficulties, and I have therefore had the confidence to feel that\r\n nothing was expected of me but a straightforward advance along the\r\n natural path of my life-work. So certain have I been of this, and so\r\n confident in the firm loyalty, safe counsel, and moral support of\r\n the eminent help surrounding me, that I have felt free to devote my\r\n energies during the past months to perfecting a plan for so broadening\r\n and strengthening the organization of the Red Cross that it may enter\r\n on a new field of useful activity--on a work that will appeal directly\r\n to the people everywhere, and prepare them, in these times of peaceful\r\n well-being, to meet intelligently and successfully any emergency or\r\n disaster that may occur, either nationally or individually. It is\r\n my desire that this new work shall be the means of creating ample\r\n funds to meet any great national calamity, and that the Red Cross may\r\n hereafter enter the field fully equipped at the instant the call may\r\n come.\r\n\r\n In times past urgent calls have come to us and precious time has\r\n been lost through lack of funds and suitable equipment. It is most\r\n desirable that this condition should be remedied, and it is to this\r\n end that I am making an appeal to the American people--_not for\r\n their money nor their substance_, but that they _coöperate_ with me\r\n earnestly in this new work: this effort to benefit themselves, that\r\n I am endeavoring to inaugurate. It will be borne in mind that, in\r\n the twenty years of its existence, the American National Red Cross\r\n has never appealed, never asked for, or sought the control of, a\r\n dollar even for relief; but has, as it seeks to do in this, left the\r\n people free in the exercise of their own choice and intelligence. The\r\n only apparent suspension of this method took place during the active\r\n service of the Spanish-American War, when the great committees, formed\r\n at the instance of President McKinley, raised money for relief, in\r\n the name of the Red Cross, and applied it; the society itself holding\r\n its normal position under the attorneyship of the noble Cuban Relief\r\n Committee, which did honor to itself and the Nation.\r\n\r\n Can it be too much to expect that this one appeal will meet a ready\r\n response at the hands of the people?\r\n\r\n We are actively organizing a new branch of the Red Cross, to be known\r\n as “The First Aid Department” of the American National Red Cross,\r\n which department will be largely educational and will concern itself\r\n in instructing the people everywhere throughout the United States\r\n in the best modern methods of first aid treatment, in all cases of\r\n accident and emergency.\r\n\r\n There will be two distinct branches of this work. For the first an\r\n emergency case, similar to that in use in England, Germany, and other\r\n Red Cross Treaty Nations, and this has been adapted to Red Cross needs\r\n and methods under the direct supervision of the Medical Board of the\r\n Red Cross Hospital. It contains material and surgical dressings of\r\n the best class known to modern surgery. A most valuable part of the\r\n permanent equipment of this emergency case is a series of emergency\r\n charts, arranged for instantaneous reference, giving simple brief\r\n instructions for dealing with every conceivable case of accident,\r\n pending the arrival of the doctor. This chart is the combined work of\r\n a committee of eminent physicians and surgeons; and, apart from the\r\n admirable manner of its arrangement, may be regarded as the highest\r\n standard of authority upon first aid methods of treatment known to the\r\n world.\r\n\r\n The other branch of the department will undertake the formation of\r\n first aid emergency classes in every city in the country. Ambulance\r\n corps will be formed among the employees of mills and factories,\r\n industrial corporations, railroad employees, the police, and employees\r\n of public departments. These employees will be drilled and instructed\r\n in first aid methods, and, apart from the value of the knowledge they\r\n will obtain for local use and service, they will form an efficient\r\n force to draw from as helpers in great national calamities.\r\n\r\n These methods are in no way experimental. In many European countries,\r\n as Germany, Russia, and even Asiatic Japan, they form one of the\r\n strongest features of the Red Cross. They are also in perfect accord\r\n with its first principles, viz., the voluntary help of the people for\r\n the Government, if in need, and the organized help of the people for\r\n each other in misfortune.\r\n\r\n This practical work in the united hands of the whole American people\r\n should raise the organization far above the need of charitable gifts\r\n for its support. The Red Cross belongs to the people; they should be\r\n their own almoners and administer their own charities.\r\n\r\n The intelligent thought of the philanthropists of the world is behind\r\n these methods; tried, well assured, and successful. Do we need to know\r\n more?\r\n\r\n I make a strong appeal for the formation of local committees\r\n everywhere; to coöperate with the headquarters staff of the First\r\n Aid Department in the formation of classes. I appeal earnestly\r\n to physicians in every town in the United States to render their\r\n aid. Next to the stricken victim and immediate friends will the\r\n kind-hearted doctor appreciate this timely and intelligent help.\r\n\r\n I appeal to every employer of labor throughout the country on behalf\r\n of this movement. I need not remind him that it is a duty, for his\r\n own kind heart will call him with a tender care to the welfare and\r\n safety of those whom circumstances and conditions have, for the time\r\n being, made his own. Their well-being is his, and protection from the\r\n inevitable dangers surrounding them will be his first care. My own\r\n convictions assure me that this appeal will be heard and responded to.\r\n I have known my country people--their good judgment, good hearts, and\r\n generous natures--too well to permit a moment’s doubt.\r\n\r\n We have established headquarters for this department at 31 East 17th\r\n Street (Union Square), New York City, where all inquiries relative to\r\n the Red Cross Emergency Corps and the formation of classes should be\r\n addressed to the General Superintendent.\r\n\r\n The plan of organization includes the formation of a finance\r\n committee, consisting of men of national reputation, who shall have\r\n entire charge of the funds of the Red Cross. This course is made\r\n necessary by the increased scope of the work contemplated, and also\r\n because it is desirable, when one returns, worn and weary, from\r\n a field of work, that no question shall arise as to the proper\r\n distribution of funds.\r\n\r\n I offer no excuse for making this appeal, beyond the vast importance\r\n of the work and the strong, ever-present desire to see that work which\r\n has been a part of my life grow into a great beneficent institution\r\n that shall be worthy of this country and its people; to see the Red\r\n Cross a badge of honor and distinction, and to know that the time will\r\n come when the active members of the American Red Cross will form the\r\n Légion d’Honneur of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis peace-time and year-round activity of the Red Cross was a part of\r\nClara Barton’s programme from the first. It was a distinctive feature\r\nof the American Red Cross, as she planned it, that its operation\r\nshould not be limited to the battle-field. Her work in time of great\r\ncalamity was taken over by European organizations, which in time went\r\nbeyond the development of the Red Cross in America, and exhibited the\r\nfull practicability of what she from the outset had believed. When\r\nshe retired from the Red Cross, she took up this work as a separate\r\nactivity; and she lived long enough to see the Red Cross, no longer\r\nunder her direction, taking up a plan which she had long advocated.\r\nShe made a little smiling comment upon it in her diary, and wished it\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nIt would have gratified Clara Barton exceedingly could she have known\r\nthat during and after the Great World War there would be organized\r\nthroughout America, under the direction of the American Red Cross,\r\nclasses for the training of people, especially women, in these and\r\nkindred lines of service. It is one more illustration of the wisdom and\r\nprevision of Clara Barton.\r\n\r\nThe years following her retirement found her active in the work of\r\nthe Woman’s Relief Corps, of which she had long served as national\r\nchaplain. She was also a guest of honor at two or more National Grand\r\nArmy encampments, and was everywhere hailed as the friend of the\r\nsoldier. During these years she seemed to grow younger rather than\r\nolder. When she was past eighty-four, a newspaper reporter described\r\nher as “a middle-aged woman.”\r\n\r\nShe made two visits to Chicago in her last years, and the visits did\r\nnot greatly weary her. The last of these visits was in May, 1910. She\r\nwas guest at a continuous round of engagements. At the May Festival of\r\nthe Social Economics Club, she shook hands with nearly two thousand\r\npeople. She attended a breakfast with eleven hundred guests and shook\r\nhands with nearly all of them.\r\n\r\nThe author of this volume holds this visit in happy memory. It occupied\r\nthree weeks, one of which Miss Barton spent in the home of her cousin,\r\nthe author. He accompanied her to a reception given in her honor at\r\nAbraham Lincoln Center, and saw her safely on her way to a number of\r\nother engagements which she had promised to attend. She met innumerable\r\nfriends, many of whom called at the house to see her, and she answered\r\nscores of letters. She rose very early in the morning and sat at her\r\ndesk until late at night, and was always calm, strong, and resolute.\r\n\r\nShe had promised to speak to the young people at their meeting on\r\nSunday evening; but when this arrangement became known there was a\r\ndemand for a wider hearing. She cheerfully consented to speak in the\r\nlarge auditorium of the church on Sunday evening. Her voice was clear,\r\nand filled the great room; every person present heard distinctly,\r\nalthough she was almost ninety years of age. Nor did she forget to\r\ntease her cousin a little over the fact that she spoke to more people\r\nin the evening than he in the morning; though his morning congregation\r\nwas not a small one.\r\n\r\nBetween her engagements were frequent opportunities during that week\r\nfor visits with her. She talked calmly about all her experiences. She\r\nreviewed her work on the battle-field during the Civil War, and spoke\r\nwith deep interest of her experiences in Constantinople where she had\r\nbeen near to the scene of the earlier work of Florence Nightingale.\r\nShe talked of her religious convictions, and of the faith with which\r\nshe was facing the future. She spoke in detail about the American\r\nRed Cross. It is only just to her memory to record that in all her\r\nconversation there was no word of bitterness or resentment, or any\r\napproach to jealousy as she saw that organization moving forward under\r\nthe direction of others.\r\n\r\nShe was happy, full of fun, gracious, considerate, and interested in\r\nall that was going on in the world. When she sat in her chair at the\r\nend of a strenuous day’s work, she rarely leaned back to touch the back\r\nof the seat; she had a back of her own, she said.\r\n\r\nIf the author could give to his readers a truthful impression of that\r\nvisit, it would be the best possible insight into the character of\r\nClara Barton. She combined in the rarest possible degree self-reliance\r\nand modesty. She knew that the work which she had done was a great\r\nwork, but it confused her when any one told her so. She responded to\r\nevery suggestion of appreciation, but she grew shy whenever she heard\r\nherself praised. Throughout the whole visit she manifested the finest\r\nquality of the cultured gentlewoman.\r\n\r\nOne thing she deeply regretted, and that was that her retirement had\r\nnot yet brought her sufficient leisure to sort her papers and prepare\r\nfor the writing of her biography. That such a book would be written she\r\nfully realized, and she cared much who wrote it. She was perfectly well\r\nin body and clear in mind, and what she hoped to do was to go through a\r\nvast accumulation of manuscripts and make the task of writing an easier\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe author urged her to write the book herself, and she hoped to\r\ncontinue the work which she had begun and to write the story of her\r\nlife in short sections. One such section she wrote and it is quoted in\r\nthe first volume of this present work. But she found too much to do in\r\nhelping the lives of others to pay very much attention to the record of\r\nher own life.\r\n\r\nSo the years went by and her life-work was completed and her biography\r\nremained unwritten. She was always thinking of another thing that\r\nneeded to be accomplished, and saying concerning it, “Until that work\r\nis done, I cannot go to heaven.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nCLARA BARTON’S DEATH AND RESURRECTION\r\n\r\n\r\nClara Barton died young. Even to those who were near her, she never\r\nseemed to grow old. At ninety there was no mark of physical infirmity\r\nupon her, nor was there any slightest slackening in the interest of the\r\nobject for which so long she had cared. On her ninetieth birthday she\r\nwrote to the Reverend Percy H. Hepler:\r\n\r\n Notwithstanding the much and more that has been said of “age” and all\r\n the stress laid upon it, I could never see and have never been able\r\n to understand how it came to be any business of ours. We have surely\r\n no control over its beginning, and, unless criminally, none over its\r\n ending. We can neither hasten nor arrest it, and how it is a matter\r\n of individual commendation I have never been able to see. I have been\r\n able to see painfully that the persistent marking of dates and adding\r\n one milestone to every year has a tendency to increase the burden\r\n of “age” and encourages a feeling of helplessness and release from\r\n activities which might be a pleasure to the possessor. I have given\r\n the exact age as recorded, lest I be suspected of trying to conceal\r\n it, but I have never, since a child, kept a “birthday” or thought of\r\n it only as a reminder by others.\r\n\r\n Somehow it has come to me to consider strength and activity, aided so\r\n far as possible by right habits of life, as forming a more correct\r\n line of limitations than the mere passing of years.\r\n\r\nSomething similar to this she said to the author. She had no pride\r\nin her great age; she did not like to be thought of as an old lady.\r\nYears were to her merely opportunities of service, not measures of\r\nlife. Notwithstanding this attitude, which prolonged her life and\r\nkept her young in spirit, Clara Barton was nearing the end of life’s\r\njourney. She had a heavy cold in the winter of 1908 and 1909, but fully\r\nrecovered, and never seemed better in health than in the summer of 1910\r\nwhen she made her journey to Chicago referred to in the last chapter.\r\nUnfortunately, she reached New England in a cold summer storm, which\r\nseemed almost like sleet, and her exposure seriously weakened her.\r\n\r\nShe returned to Glen Echo in August, but did not fully recover her\r\nstrength. That winter she had double pneumonia, and her physician told\r\nher she had but one chance of life. “I will take that chance,” she said\r\ncalmly. She took that chance and recovered.\r\n\r\nBut she did not grow strong again. The news of the death of her niece,\r\nMrs. Riccius, was a great shock to her. Her heart almost ceased to\r\nbeat. Always her concern for those whom she loved affected her more\r\nthan anything that could happen to her.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1911 she made her last visit to Oxford. She made the\r\njourney with no ill effects, but the summer did not bring her permanent\r\nimprovement. Long years of constant work and the serious illness of\r\nthe winter had caused a slight weakness in the muscular action of the\r\nheart. Otherwise, her physicians could find no organic ailment.\r\n\r\nWhen she was at work in Galveston in 1900, she was seriously ill. Her\r\nphysician whispered to her nephew, Stephen, that she could live only a\r\nfew hours. She overheard the word, and calling Stephen to her whispered\r\nto him, “I shall not die; don’t let them frighten you.” In that spirit\r\nshe had met the numerous predictions of her death in the various\r\nillnesses of the years.\r\n\r\nBut it was not so after the summer of 1911. She went back to Glen Echo\r\nwithout her usual invigoration from her weeks in New England.\r\n\r\nStill she did not give up. She had periods of old-time vigor. Here is\r\nan entry in her diary for Friday and Saturday, February 11 and 12, 1910:\r\n\r\n At night I fold the wash of Monday for ironing to-morrow. Up at six:\r\n commenced ironing and continued till all was done, at one o’clock.\r\n At night took the clothes from the frames and put them in place, and\r\n felt that for once one thing was done as it should be. ’Twas finished\r\n before leaving.\r\n\r\nShe commented on the bad behavior of the Suffragettes, whom she\r\nbelieved to be injuring their cause by unwomanly conduct.\r\n\r\nA week later:\r\n\r\n We moved the large desk to my chambers from the dining-room below. A\r\n spacious desk it makes. One should be able to write a History of the\r\n World with such accommodations.\r\n\r\nShe was concerned for her old and faithful horse, Baba; and, when one\r\nnight he was out in pasture and it turned somewhat cold, she could not\r\nsleep, but got up at four o’clock in the morning, fed Baba a full feed\r\nof corn, and some fruit from the table, and went back to bed.\r\n\r\nHer diaries of 1907 had been neglected. She tried to bring them up to\r\ndate from her pencil notes:\r\n\r\n It seems to have been a hard year for me. It makes me tired to read it.\r\n\r\nThat spring she trimmed the rosebushes and set out flowers. A fire\r\nbroke out in her room; the floor grew hot from the burning-out of the\r\nsoot in a sheet-iron drum; and she got water and wet the floor till\r\nthe chimney and pipe had burned out.\r\n\r\nShe mourned over the death of Mark Twain:\r\n\r\n We have lost something very precious in his rich vein of humor. There\r\n are losses that are never made good. We have not another Whittier, or\r\n another Mark Twain.\r\n\r\nThe diary for 1911 begins with the multitude of Christmas greetings\r\nreceived and sent. The process took her several days and left her\r\nvery weary. This led her to reflect that she was kept so busy with\r\ninconsequential writing that she had no time to do the writing she so\r\nmuch wanted to do, her Life and the story of her work.\r\n\r\nShe had an invitation from the “Review of Reviews” to write an article\r\non “Hospitals and Hospital Nurses of the Civil War.” She declined, on\r\nthe ground that she knew nothing about the subject! She had not been a\r\nnurse, and did not pretend to write as if she had been.\r\n\r\nThis was in January, 1911, and in February she had pneumonia, but\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nThat summer she had two or more visits from a man who expressed himself\r\nwith great emphasis on the subject of the immodesty of woman’s dress;\r\nshe agreed with him, but felt it was hardly fair to talk to her as if\r\nshe were to blame or needed to be convinced. “But really, he is not\r\nwithout provocation. Huge hats, dangerous hatpins, hobble and harem\r\nskirts, and the conduct of the Suffragettes are hard to defend.”\r\n\r\nMost of her visitors just ran in from Washington, and ran away,\r\nhurrying back to the city. One day an old friend came and spent the\r\nafternoon and the night:\r\n\r\n This day has been extremely social. It is really refreshing to see a\r\n man who has a little time, and not always in a rush with a watch in\r\n his hand to catch the next train. I fail to believe that these nervous\r\n persons accomplish the most, or are actually the best business men.\r\n Hurry is a habit with them. They make every one uncomfortable with\r\n their own selfish plans, and all are relieved to get them off and see\r\n them go.\r\n\r\nIn April she began to feel that she could take up and finish her\r\nHistory of the Red Cross.\r\n\r\nIn that month, Dr. Hubbell was grafting trees. She had always coveted\r\nthe learning of that art; so she took lessons in tree-grafting. Also,\r\nshe began to learn the use of the typewriter, at the age of eighty-nine.\r\n\r\nShe was interested in the trial of the Los Angeles dynamiters; in\r\nthe activity of Mr. Bryan, whom she wished the Democrats might have\r\nsense enough to nominate; and, if a Democrat had to be elected, she, a\r\nRepublican, wished it might be he.\r\n\r\nShe read a “Life” of the Brontë sisters. She read in good English\r\ntranslations “The Apology” of Socrates, the address of Xenophon to\r\nhis army, some of the orations of Demosthenes, and other good old\r\nliterature. She read the daily papers, and commented on all important\r\ncurrent happenings.\r\n\r\nShe provided a final home for Baba, eighty miles away in Virginia, bade\r\nhim a fond farewell, and sent money regularly to keep him well fed.\r\n\r\nIn May she wrote her will; the same will that was probated a few months\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nShe commented on the great Suffrage parade in London, with satisfaction\r\nthat the cause of Woman Suffrage was gaining, but with rather sad\r\nreflection that, fallible as men were, she had found women even more\r\nso; and she thought suffrage would be a blessing, but not an unmixed\r\nblessing.\r\n\r\nShe salted down eggs in early summer, and in the late fall they were\r\ncandled and found good. She oversaw the management of her household,\r\nand part of the time she did her own cooking, in this, her last summer.\r\n\r\nThese citations are given, not because they are important in\r\nthemselves, but because they give little glimpses of her life in her\r\nlast few months. Certainly she did not permit herself to rust out in\r\nmind or body. A physical examination after her recovery from pneumonia\r\nin 1911 found her with every bodily organ sound, but with a pulse\r\nsomewhat easily disturbed.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas, 1911, her ninetieth birthday, she sent to the world\r\nthrough the press this message:\r\n\r\n Please deliver for me a message of peace and good-will to all the\r\n world for Christmas. I am feeling much better to-day, and have every\r\n hope of spending a pleasant and joyful Christmas, my ninetieth\r\n birthday.\r\n\r\nHer hope was fulfilled and she celebrated her ninetieth Christmas with\r\nquiet but cheerful festivities.\r\n\r\nAs the rigor of winter came on, she was taken again with double\r\npneumonia. In the weeks that followed, hope alternated with fear,\r\nuntil, on April 12, 1912, at nine o’clock in the morning, she cried\r\nout, “Let me go; let me go,” and the earthly life of Clara Barton came\r\nto its close.\r\n\r\nA few days before she died, she talked with her nephew, Stephen,\r\nconcerning her funeral, and chose for herself the principal speakers.\r\nShe desired that her long-time and trusted friend, Mrs. John A. Logan,\r\nshould say the principal words in a preliminary service to be held in\r\nGlen Echo, and that at the main funeral service to be held in Oxford,\r\nthe chief speakers should be her friend the Reverend Percy Epler, and\r\nher cousin, the Reverend William E. Barton. She mentioned others as\r\nthose whom she would be glad to have share in the services, and her\r\nwishes were carried out.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday afternoon a brief service was held at Glen Echo. The\r\nReverend John Van Schaick, Jr., pastor of the “Church of our Father,”\r\nUniversalist, of Washington, read the Scripture and offered prayer.\r\n\r\nThe Reverend W. W. Curry, a veteran of the Civil War, paid her a brief\r\nand heartfelt tribute, which was followed by three addresses, by\r\nChaplain Coudon, of the House of Representatives, Mrs. John A. Logan,\r\nand the Honorable Peter V. De Graw.\r\n\r\nThe body reached Oxford in the early morning of April 16th, accompanied\r\nby Mr. and Mrs. Stephen E. Barton; Francis Atwater, of Meriden,\r\nConnecticut; Dr. Eugene Underhill, President of the Nurses’ College\r\nof Philadelphia; and Dr. Julian B. Hubbell. It had long since become\r\napparent that no church in Oxford would contain the congregation. The\r\nservice was held in Memorial Hall, which was filled to overflowing,\r\nand it was estimated that as many as five hundred people were unable\r\nto secure admission. Delegations were present from many cities, and\r\nrepresentatives of various patriotic organizations were in attendance.\r\nFloral tributes had been received from many parts of the Nation, and a\r\nmagnificent wreath was sent by the Grand Duchess of Baden. The casket\r\nwas almost hidden with flowers. Above it was a great red cross made of\r\ncarnations, and upon the casket was a large bouquet of red roses, the\r\nflowers which all her life she most had loved and which had belonged to\r\nher family since the days of the Wars of the Roses.\r\n\r\nAppropriate music was rendered by the Schumann Quartet of Boston,\r\nwho sang sympathetically Tennyson’s “Crossing the Bar.” The opening\r\nwords of Scripture, “I am the Resurrection and the Life,” and of the\r\ncomforting sentences, “Let not your heart be troubled,” were recited by\r\nthe Reverend William E. Barton.\r\n\r\nThe Reverend John P. Marvin read the Bible lesson. Mrs. Allen L. Joslyn\r\nread a beautiful tribute from the Town of Oxford, and Mr. J. Brainard\r\nHall, of Worcester, a veteran of the Civil War, represented the Woman’s\r\nRelief Corps in a tribute which included the placing of a silk flag\r\nupon her breast as she lay in the casket.\r\n\r\nThe two formal addresses were then delivered by the ministers whom she\r\nhad chosen, the Reverend Percy E. Epler, pastor of the Adams Square\r\nCongregational Church of Worcester, and the Reverend William E. Barton,\r\nof Oak Park, Illinois.\r\n\r\nFor an hour after the service, the people filed through the hall and\r\npast the casket for a last look at her face.\r\n\r\nThe body was then borne to the hearse, escorted by a guard of the Grand\r\nArmy of the Republic, its chaplain, H. A. Philbrook, and the color\r\nsergeant leading the procession.\r\n\r\nThe North Oxford Cemetery has a beautiful and sightly elevation,\r\ncontaining the largest lot in the enclosure where for generations the\r\nBartons have been buried. There her body was laid to rest, the hands of\r\nold soldiers lowering it to its last resting-place.\r\n\r\nIt was a glorious day in the spring. The services had begun at one\r\no’clock, and, as the procession entered the cemetery, the sun was\r\nnear its setting. The cemetery was thronged with people, the crowd\r\ncontaining many who had been unable to secure admission to the hall.\r\nThe music in the hall had been rendered by a male quartet. Clara Barton\r\nhad never cared greatly for music, but the music that she liked best\r\nwas that rendered by male voices or sung heartily by a congregation. In\r\nthe cemetery one hymn was sung, “Nearer, my God, to Thee,” the whole\r\ngreat congregation joining in the singing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CLARA BARTON\r\n\r\n  “ANGEL OF THE BATTLEFIELD”\r\n  CIVIL WAR 1861-1865\r\n  FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR 1870-1871\r\n  SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR 1898\r\n  ORGANIZER AND PRESIDENT OF THE\r\n  AMERICAN NATIONAL RED CROSS\r\n  1881--1904\r\n\r\n  DEC. 25, 1821--April 12, 1912\r\n\r\nIN THE CEMETERY AT OXFORD]\r\n\r\nA prayer was offered by a blind soldier, Chaplain Simmons, of Worcester.\r\n\r\nThe closing scene can hardly be described. Dr. Barton took his place at\r\nthe head of the grave, holding in his hand a large bunch of red roses,\r\nand the place at the foot of the grave was taken by the Reverend Doctor\r\nTyler, “Father Tyler,” a venerable and saintly man, who had buried the\r\nfathers and mothers of the Barton family in Oxford. He stood with his\r\nlong white beard and silver hair irradiated by the sunset; and, in a\r\nvoice tender, and reverent and comforting, spoke the following words:\r\n\r\n In the few words with which I am to close this service, I shall\r\n indulge in no repetition of what has been said, and so well said,\r\n by the principal speakers on this occasion, eulogistic of the life\r\n and the life-work of the most celebrated woman of the world, whose\r\n mortal remains we have here deposited in the resting-place of her\r\n choice, among the beloved of her family. My thought will lead you in\r\n another direction, which has hardly been alluded to, if at all, in the\r\n eloquent addresses to which we have listened.\r\n\r\n As we look into the grave and bid farewell to the mortal remains of\r\n Clara Barton, we instinctively are led to ask ourselves, “Where is\r\n Clara Barton who for more than ninety years made them the agencies\r\n of her great work in the world?” The life, the spirit, the soul--has\r\n that been destroyed by death? Does utter annihilation follow the\r\n development and growth of such a life?\r\n\r\n As a Christian minister I feel I give a voice to the scriptural\r\n revelation of life and immortality when I say emphatically, “No!” She\r\n still lives! She has entered the pearly gates of the Holy City and is\r\n now walking the golden streets of the New Jerusalem! She has been born\r\n again into the newer life, as Christ taught the inquiring Pharisee,\r\n and our aged friend is now among the youngest of the Immortals!\r\n\r\n I feel that while the Nation mourns because of her going, all heaven\r\n is rejoicing because of her coming! This great gathering of friends\r\n who sorrowfully bid her good-bye is but typical of the greater\r\n multitude of friends who have gone before her, and who, with smiling\r\n faces and extended hands, have given her a heavenly welcome. In a\r\n little while, after the pain of our grief has softened, we shall be\r\n glad, and bless God that He has taken her to Himself.\r\n\r\n Now we know nothing, or but little, of the vocations and employments\r\n of the eternal life; except concerning the angels as “ministering\r\n spirits” they are nowhere revealed; but reasoning from analogy I am\r\n convinced that as doing is necessary to our happiness here, so a busy\r\n activity must be essential to the happiness of Heaven. In this regard\r\n we may be assured that Clara Barton will not be found wanting.\r\n\r\n And so by faith beholding her as a happy spirit in the glorious life\r\n to which she has been promoted, we may all join in giving to these\r\n relics of her earthly life, as they peacefully rest for always in\r\n their last home, a heartfelt, loving\r\n\r\n  Good-Bye!\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of this brief and touching address, Dr. Barton spoke the\r\nwords of committal; and, as he uttered, “Dust to dust, ashes to ashes,”\r\ndropped upon the lowered casket the large red roses, and pronounced the\r\nbenediction.\r\n\r\nJust then a mother stepped up and whispered, “My little girl was born\r\nin Clara Barton’s birthplace; in the very room where she was born. Will\r\nyou baptize her, and will you do it now?”\r\n\r\n“Bring her to me,” said the minister, “and I will christen her ‘Clara\r\nBarton.’”\r\n\r\nSo the name was bestowed in that hour upon another little girl, whose\r\nparents sought that the spirit that had lived in Clara Barton might\r\nlive again in the life of their own daughter.\r\n\r\nTwo years from the following summer, the world witnessed a desolating\r\nwar, and the months that followed wrought their inevitable destiny\r\nby plunging America into the seething conflict. Long before America\r\nformally entered the fight, the American Red Cross was active in\r\nmeasures of relief for the sorrowing nations of Europe. When, at\r\nlength, the United States itself entered the war, the Red Cross blazed\r\nforth in every community between the oceans. Churches and town halls\r\nand private homes became dépôts where supplies were collected, bandages\r\nrolled, and workers trained. Hospitals, in our own country and along\r\nthe battle-front, were erected and equipped. To them went thousands of\r\nAmerican young women, each one of them wearing, on her arm or cap, the\r\nsymbol which Clara Barton brought back to her own land after the close\r\nof the Franco-Prussian War. In their heroism and their deeds of mercy,\r\nClara Barton lived again.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Acquia Creek, I: 168, 209, 273.\r\n\r\n  Alcott, Louisa M., I: 47.\r\n\r\n  Amidon, George H., I: 314.\r\n\r\n  Andrew, Gov.
