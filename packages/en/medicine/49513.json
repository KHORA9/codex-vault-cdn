The\r\nsmall Counterfeit ones have only this Title, THE ENGLISH PHYSICIAN.\r\n\r\n_The second Direction._—The true one hath these words, GOVERNMENT\r\nAND VIRTUES, following the time of the Plants flowering, &c. The\r\ncounterfeit small ones have these words, VIRTUES AND USE, following the\r\ntime of the Plants flowering.\r\n\r\n_The third Direction._—The true one is of a larger Letter than the\r\ncounterfeit ones, which are in _Twelves_, &c., of the Letter small\r\nBibles used to be printed on. I shall now speak something of the book\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nAll other Authors that have written of the nature of Herbs, give not\r\na bit of reason why such an Herb was appropriated to such a part of\r\nthe body, nor why it cured such a disease. Truly my own body being\r\nsickly, brought me easily into a capacity, to know that health was\r\nthe greatest of all earthly blessings, and truly he was never sick\r\nthat doth not believe it. Then I considered that all medicines were\r\ncompounded of Herbs, Roots, Flowers, Seeds, &c., and this first set\r\nme to work in studying the nature of simples, most of which I knew\r\nby sight before; and indeed all the Authors I could read gave me but\r\nlittle satisfaction in this particular, or none at all. I cannot build\r\nmy faith upon Authors’ words, nor believe a thing because they say it,\r\nand could wish every body were of my mind in this,—to labour to be\r\nable to give a reason for every thing they say or do. They say Reason\r\nmakes a man differ from a Beast; if that be true, pray what are they\r\nthat, instead of reason for their judgment, quote old Authors? Perhaps\r\ntheir authors knew a reason for what they wrote, perhaps they did not;\r\nwhat is that to us? Do we know it? Truly in writing this work first,\r\nto satisfy myself, I drew out all the virtues of the vulgar or common\r\nHerbs, Plants, and Trees, &c., out of the best or most approved authors\r\nI had, or could get; and having done so, I set myself to study the\r\nreason of them. I knew well enough the whole world, and every thing\r\nin it, was formed of a composition of contrary elements, and in such\r\na harmony as must needs show the wisdom and power of a great God. I\r\nknew as well this Creation, though thus composed of contraries, was one\r\nunited body, and man an epitome of it: I knew those various affections\r\nin man, in respect of sickness and health, were caused naturally\r\n(though God may have other ends best known to himself) by the various\r\noperations of the Microcosm; and I could not be ignorant, that as the\r\ncause is, so must the cure be; and therefore he that would know the\r\nreason of the operation of the Herbs, must look up as high as the\r\nStars, astrologically. I always found the disease vary according to the\r\nvarious motions of the Stars; and this is enough, one would think, to\r\nteach a man by the effect where the cause lies. Then to find out the\r\nreason of the operation of Herbs, Plants, &c., by the Stars went I; and\r\nherein I could find but few authors, but those as full of nonsense and\r\ncontradiction as an egg is full of meat. This not being pleasing, and\r\nless profitable to me, I consulted with my two brothers, DR. REASON and\r\nDR. EXPERIENCE, and took a voyage to visit my mother NATURE, by whose\r\nadvice, together with the help of DR. DILIGENCE, I at last obtained my\r\ndesire; and, being warned by MR. HONESTY, a stranger in our days, to\r\npublish it to the world, I have done it.\r\n\r\nBut you will say, _What need I have written on this Subject, seeing so\r\nmany famous and learned men have written so much of it in the English\r\nTongue, much more than I have done?_\r\n\r\nTo this I answer, neither GERRARD nor PARKINSON, or any that ever wrote\r\nin the like nature, ever gave one wise reason for what they wrote, and\r\nso did nothing else but train up young novices in Physic in the School\r\nof tradition, and teach them just as a parrot is taught to speak; an\r\nAuthor says so, therefore it is true; and if all that Authors say be\r\ntrue, why do they contradict one another? But in mine, if you view it\r\nwith the eye of reason, you shall see a reason for everything that is\r\nwritten, whereby you may find the very ground and foundation of Physic;\r\nyou may know what you do, and wherefore you do it; and this shall call\r\nme Father, it being (that I know of) never done in the world before.\r\n\r\nI have now but two things to write, and then I have done.\r\n\r\n    1. _What the profit and benefit of this Work is._\r\n\r\n    2. _Instructions in the use of it._\r\n\r\n1. The profit and benefit arising from it, or that may occur to a wise\r\nman from it are many; so many that should I sum up all the particulars,\r\nmy Epistle would be as big as my Book; I shall quote some few general\r\nheads.\r\n\r\nFirst. The admirable Harmony of the Creation is herein seen, in the\r\ninfluence of Stars upon Herbs and the Body of Man, how one part of the\r\nCreation is subservient to another, and all for the use of Man, whereby\r\nthe infinite power and wisdom of God in the creation appear; and if I\r\ndo not admire at the simplicity of the Ranters, never trust me; who but\r\nviewing the Creation can hold such a sottish opinion, as that it was\r\nfrom eternity, when the mysteries of it are so clear to every eye? but\r\nthat Scripture shall be verified to them, _Rom._ i. 20: “_The invisible\r\nthings of him from the Creation of the World are clearly seen, being\r\nunderstood by the things that are made, even his Eternal Power and\r\nGodhead; so that they are without excuse._”—And a Poet could teach them\r\na better lesson;\r\n\r\n    “_Because out of thy thoughts God shall not pass,_\r\n    “_His image stamped is on every grass._”\r\n\r\nThis indeed is true, God has stamped his image on every creature, and\r\ntherefore the abuse of the creature is a great sin; but how much the\r\nmore do the wisdom and excellency of God appear, if we consider the\r\nharmony of the Creation in the virtue and operation of every Herb!\r\n\r\nSecondly, Hereby you may know what infinite knowledge _Adam_ had in his\r\ninnocence, that by looking upon a creature, he was able to give it a\r\nname according to its nature; and by knowing that, thou mayest know how\r\ngreat thy fall was and be humbled for it even in this respect, because\r\nhereby thou art so ignorant.\r\n\r\nThirdly, Here is the right way for thee to begin at the study of\r\nPhysic, if thou art minded to begin at the right end, for here\r\nthou hast the reason of the whole art. I wrote before in certain\r\nAstrological Lectures, which I read, and printed, intituled,\r\n_Astrological Judgment of Diseases_, what planet caused (as a second\r\ncause) every disease, how it might be found out what planet caused it;\r\nhere thou hast what planet cures it by _Sympathy_ and _Antipathy_; and\r\nthis brings me to my last promise, _viz._\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Instructions for the right use of the book._\r\n\r\nAnd herein let me premise a word or two. The Herbs, Plants, &c. are now\r\nin the book appropriated to their proper planets. Therefore,\r\n\r\nFirst, Consider what planet causeth the disease; that thou mayest find\r\nit in my aforesaid Judgment of Diseases.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Consider what part of the body is afflicted by the disease,\r\nand whether it lies in the flesh, or blood, or bones, or ventricles.\r\n\r\nThirdly, Consider by what planet the afflicted part of the body is\r\ngoverned: that my Judgment of Diseases will inform you also.\r\n\r\nFourthly, You may oppose diseases by Herbs of the planet, opposite\r\nto the planet that causes them: as diseases of _Jupiter_ by herbs of\r\n_Mercury_, and the contrary; diseases of the _Luminaries_ by the herbs\r\nof _Saturn_, and the contrary; diseases of _Mars_ by herbs of _Venus_,\r\nand the contrary.\r\n\r\nFifthly, There is a way to cure diseases sometimes by _Sympathy_, and\r\nso every planet cures his own disease; as the _Sun_ and _Moon_ by\r\ntheir Herbs cure the Eyes, _Saturn_ the Spleen, _Jupiter_ the liver,\r\n_Mars_ the Gall and diseases of choler, and _Venus_ diseases in the\r\ninstruments of Generation.\r\n\r\n                                                  NICH. CULPEPER.\r\n\r\n  From my House in Spitalfields,\r\n    next door to the Red Lion,\r\n      _September 5, 1653_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS DEAREST CONSORT\r\n\r\nMRS. ALICE CULPEPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST,\r\n\r\nTHE works that I have published to the world (though envied by some\r\nilliterate physicians) have merited such just applause, that thou\r\nmayest be confident in proceeding to publish anything I leave thee,\r\nespecially this master-piece: assuring my friends and countrymen, that\r\nthey will receive as much benefit by this, as by my _Dispensatory_,\r\nand that incomparable piece called, _Semiotica Uranica_ enlarged, and\r\n_English Physician_.\r\n\r\nThese are the choicest secrets, which I have had many years locked up\r\nin my own breast. I gained them by my constant practice, and by them I\r\nmaintained a continual reputation in the world, and I doubt not but the\r\nworld will honour thee for divulging them; and my fame shall continue\r\nand increase thereby, though the period of my Life and Studies be at\r\nhand, and I must now bid all things under the sun farewell. Farewell,\r\nmy dear wife and child; farewell, Arts and Sciences, which I so dearly\r\nloved; farewell, all worldly glories; adieu, readers,\r\n\r\n                                                  NICHOLAS CULPEPER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNICHOLAS CULPEPER, the Author of this Work, was son of Nicholas\r\nCulpeper, a Clergyman, and grandson of Sir Thomas Culpeper, Bart. He\r\nwas some time a student in the university of Cambridge, and soon after\r\nwas bound apprentice to an Apothecary. He employed all his leisure\r\nhours in the study of Physic and Astrology, which he afterwards\r\nprofessed, and set up business in Spitalfields, next door to the\r\nRed Lion, (formerly known as the Half-way House between Islington\r\nand Stepney, an exact representation of which we have given under\r\nour Author’s Portrait), where he had considerable practice, and was\r\nmuch resorted to for his advice, which he gave to the poor gratis.\r\nAstrological Doctors have always been highly respected; and those\r\ncelebrated Physicians of the early times, whom our Author seems to\r\nhave particularly studied, Hippocrates, Galen, and Avicen, regarded\r\nthose as homicides who were ignorant of Astrology. Paracelsus, indeed,\r\nwent farther; he declared, a Physician should be predestinated to the\r\ncure of his patient; and the horoscope should be inspected, the plants\r\ngathered at the critical moment, &c.\r\n\r\nCulpeper was a writer and translator of several Works, the most\r\ncelebrated of which is his Herbal, “being an astrologo-physical\r\ndiscourse of the common herbs of the nation; containing a complete\r\nMethod or Practice of Physic, whereby a Man may preserve his Body in\r\nHealth, or cure himself when sick, with such things only as grow in\r\nEngland, they being most fit for English Constitutions.”\r\n\r\nThis celebrated, and useful Physician died at his house in\r\nSpitalfields, in the year 1654. This Book will remain as a lasting\r\nmonument of his skill and industry.\r\n\r\n    “Culpeper, the man that first ranged the woods and climbed\r\n    the mountains in search of medicinal and salutary herbs, has\r\n    undoubtedly merited the gratitude of posterity.”—DR. JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nENGLISH PHYSICIAN\r\n\r\nENLARGED.\r\n\r\n\r\n    AMARA DULCIS.\r\n\r\nCONSIDERING divers shires in this nation give divers names to one and\r\nthe same herb, and that the common name which it bears in one county,\r\nis not known in another; I shall take the pains to set down all the\r\nnames that I know of each herb: pardon me for setting that name first,\r\nwhich is most common to myself. Besides Amara Dulcis, some call it\r\nMortal, others Bitter-sweet; some Woody Night-shade, and others\r\nFelon-wort.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] It grows up with woody stalks even to a man’s height, and\r\nsometimes higher. The leaves fall off at the approach of winter, and\r\nspring out of the same stalk at spring-time: the branch is compassed\r\nabout with a whitish bark, and has a pith in the middle of it: the\r\nmain branch branches itself into many small ones with claspers, laying\r\nhold on what is next to them, as vines do: it bears many leaves, they\r\ngrow in no order at all, at least in no regular order; the leaves are\r\nlongish, though somewhat broad, and pointed at the ends: many of them\r\nhave two little leaves growing at the end of their foot-stalk; some\r\nhave but one, and some none. The leaves are of a pale green colour;\r\nthe flowers are of a purple colour, or of a perfect blue, like to\r\nviolets, and they stand many of them together in knots: the berries are\r\ngreen at first, but when they are ripe they are very red; if you taste\r\nthem, you shall find them just as the crabs which we in Sussex call\r\nBittersweet, _viz._ sweet at first and bitter afterwards.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow commonly almost throughout England, especially in\r\nmoist and shady places.\r\n\r\n_Time._] The leaves shoot out about the latter end of March, if the\r\ntemperature of the air be ordinary; it flowers in July, and the seeds\r\nare ripe soon after, usually in the next month.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the planet Mercury, and\r\na notable herb of his also, if it be rightly gathered under his\r\ninfluence. It is excellently good to remove witchcraft both in men\r\nand beasts, as also all sudden diseases whatsoever. Being tied round\r\nabout the neck, is one of the most admirable remedies for the vertigo\r\nor dizziness in the head; and that is the reason (as Tragus saith) the\r\npeople in Germany commonly hang it about their cattle’s necks, when\r\nthey fear any such evil hath betided them: Country people commonly\r\ntake the berries of it, and having bruised them, apply them to felons,\r\nand thereby soon rid their fingers of such troublesome guests.\r\n\r\nWe have now showed you the external use of the herb; we shall speak\r\na word or two of the internal, and so conclude. Take notice, it is a\r\nMercurial herb, and therefore of very subtile parts, as indeed all\r\nMercurial plants are; therefore take a pound of the wood and leaves\r\ntogether, bruise the wood (which you may easily do, for it is not so\r\nhard as oak) then put it in a pot, and put to it three pints of white\r\nwine, put on the pot-lid and shut it close; and let it infuse hot over\r\na gentle fire twelve hours, then strain it out, so have you a most\r\nexcellent drink to open obstructions of the liver and spleen, to help\r\ndifficulty of breath, bruises and falls, and congealed blood in any\r\npart of the body, it helps the yellow jaundice, the dropsy, and black\r\njaundice, and to cleanse women newly brought to bed. You may drink a\r\nquarter of a pint of the infusion every morning. It purges the body\r\nvery gently, and not churlishly as some hold. And when you find good by\r\nthis, remember me.\r\n\r\nThey that think the use of these medicines is too brief, it is only for\r\nthe cheapness of the book; let them read those books of mine, of the\r\nlast edition, _viz._ _Reverius_, _Veslingus_, _Riolanus_, _Johnson_,\r\n_Sennertus_, and _Physic for the Poor_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ALL-HEAL.\r\n\r\nIT is called All-heal, Hercules’s All-heal, and Hercules’s Woundwort,\r\nbecause it is supposed that Hercules learned the herb and its virtues\r\nfrom Chiron, when he learned physic of him. Some call it Panay, and\r\nothers Opopane-wort.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] Its root is long, thick, and exceeding full of juice, of\r\na hot and biting taste, the leaves are great and large, and winged\r\nalmost like ash-tree leaves, but that they are something hairy, each\r\nleaf consisting of five or six pair of such wings set one against the\r\nother upon foot-stalks, broad below, but narrow towards the end; one\r\nof the leaves is a little deeper at the bottom than the other, of a\r\nfair yellowish fresh green colour: they are of a bitterish taste,\r\nbeing chewed in the mouth; from among these rises up a stalk, green in\r\ncolour, round in form, great and strong in magnitude, five or six feet\r\nin altitude, with many joints, and some leaves thereat; towards the top\r\ncome forth umbels of small yellow flowers, after which are passed away,\r\nyou may find whitish, yellow, short, flat seeds, bitter also in taste.\r\n\r\n_Place._] Having given you a description of the herb from bottom to\r\ntop, give me leave to tell you, that there are other herbs called by\r\nthis name; but because they are strangers in England, I give only the\r\ndescription of this, which is easily to be had in the gardens of divers\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n_Time._] Although Gerrard saith, that they flower from the beginning\r\nof May to the end of December, experience teaches them that keep it in\r\ntheir gardens, that it flowers not till the latter end of the summer,\r\nand sheds its seeds presently after.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of Mars, hot,\r\nbiting, and choleric; and remedies what evils Mars inflicts the body\r\nof man with, by sympathy, as vipers’ flesh attracts poison, and\r\nthe loadstone iron. It kills the worms, helps the gout, cramp, and\r\nconvulsions, provokes urine, and helps all joint-aches. It helps all\r\ncold griefs of the head, the vertigo, falling-sickness, the lethargy,\r\nthe wind cholic, obstructions of the liver and spleen, stone in the\r\nkidneys and bladder. It provokes the terms, expels the dead birth:\r\nit is excellent good for the griefs of the sinews, itch, stone, and\r\ntooth-ache, the biting of mad dogs and venomous beasts, and purges\r\ncholer very gently.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ALKANET.\r\n\r\nBESIDES the common name, it is called Orchanet, and Spanish Bugloss,\r\nand by apothecaries, Enchusa.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] Of the many sorts of this herb, there is but one known to\r\ngrow commonly in this nation; of which one take this description: It\r\nhath a great and thick root, of a reddish colour, long, narrow, hairy\r\nleaves, green like the leaves of Bugloss, which lie very thick upon the\r\nground; the stalks rise up compassed round about, thick with leaves,\r\nwhich are less and narrower than the former; they are tender, and\r\nslender, the flowers are hollow, small, and of a reddish colour.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in Kent near Rochester, and in many places in the\r\nWest Country, both in Devonshire and Cornwall.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in July and the beginning of August, and the\r\nseed is ripe soon after, but the root is in its prime, as carrots and\r\nparsnips are, before the herb runs up to stalk.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb under the dominion of Venus,\r\nand indeed one of her darlings, though somewhat hard to come by. It\r\nhelps old ulcers, hot inflammations, burnings by common fire, and St.\r\nAnthony’s fire, by antipathy to Mars; for these uses, your best way is\r\nto make it into an ointment; also, if you make a vinegar of it, as you\r\nmake vinegar of roses, it helps the morphew and leprosy; if you apply\r\nthe herb to the privities, it draws forth the dead child. It helps the\r\nyellow jaundice, spleen, and gravel in the kidneys. Dioscorides saith\r\nit helps such as are bitten by a venomous beast, whether it be taken\r\ninwardly, or applied to the wound; nay, he saith further, if any one\r\nthat hath newly eaten it, do but spit into the mouth of a serpent, the\r\nserpent instantly dies. It stays the flux of the belly, kills worms,\r\nhelps the fits of the mother. Its decoction made in wine, and drank,\r\nstrengthens the back, and eases the pains thereof: It helps bruises\r\nand falls, and is as gallant a remedy to drive out the small pox and\r\nmeasles as any is; an ointment made of it, is excellent for green\r\nwounds, pricks or thrusts.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ADDER’S TONGUE OR SERPENT’S TONGUE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS herb has but one leaf, which grows with the stalk\r\na finger’s length above the ground, being flat and of a fresh green\r\ncolour; broad like Water Plantain, but less, without any rib in it;\r\nfrom the bottom of which leaf, on the inside, rises up (ordinarily)\r\none, sometimes two or three slender stalks, the upper half whereof\r\nis somewhat bigger, and dented with small dents of a yellowish green\r\ncolour, like the tongue of an adder serpent (only this is as useful as\r\nthey are formidable). The roots continue all the year.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in moist meadows, and such like places.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It is to be found in May or April, for it quickly perishes\r\nwith a little heat.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb under the dominion of the Moon\r\nand Cancer, and therefore if the weakness of the retentive faculty be\r\ncaused by an evil influence of Saturn in any part of the body governed\r\nby the Moon, or under the dominion of Cancer, this herb cures it by\r\nsympathy: It cures these diseases after specified, in any part of the\r\nbody under the influence of Saturn, by antipathy.\r\n\r\nIt is temperate in respect of heat, but dry in the second degree. The\r\njuice of the leaves, drank with the distilled water of Horse-tail, is\r\na singular remedy for all manner of wounds in the breast, bowels, or\r\nother parts of the body, and is given with good success to those that\r\nare troubled with casting, vomiting, or bleeding at the mouth or nose,\r\nor otherwise downwards. The said juice given in the distilled water\r\nof Oaken-buds, is very good for women who have their usual courses,\r\nor the whites flowing down too abundantly. It helps sore eyes. Of the\r\nleaves infused or boiled in oil, omphacine or unripe olives, set in the\r\nsun four certain days, or the green leaves sufficiently boiled in the\r\nsaid oil, is made an excellent green balsam, not only for green and\r\nfresh wounds, but also for old and inveterate ulcers, especially if a\r\nlittle fine clear turpentine be dissolved therein. It also stays and\r\nrefreshes all inflammations that arise upon pains by hurts and wounds.\r\n\r\nWhat parts of the body are under each planet and sign, and also what\r\ndisease may be found in my astrological judgment of diseases; and for\r\nthe internal work of nature in the body of man; as vital, animal,\r\nnatural and procreative spirits of man; the apprehension, judgment,\r\nmemory; the external senses, _viz._ seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting\r\nand feeling; the virtuous, attractive, retentive, digestive, expulsive,\r\n&c. under the dominion of what planets they are, may be found in my\r\n_Ephemeris_ for the year 1651. In both which you shall find the chaff\r\nof authors blown away by the fame of Dr. Reason, and nothing but\r\nrational truths left for the ingenious to feed upon.\r\n\r\nLastly. To avoid blotting paper with one thing many times, and also\r\nto ease your purses in the price of the book, and withal to make you\r\nstudious in physic; you have at the latter end of the book, the way\r\nof preserving all herbs either in juice, conserve, oil, ointment or\r\nplaister, electuary, pills, or troches.\r\n\r\n\r\n    AGRIMONY.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS has divers long leaves (some greater, some smaller)\r\nset upon a stalk, all of them dented about the edges, green above, and\r\ngreyish underneath, and a little hairy withal. Among which arises up\r\nusually but one strong, round, hairy, brown stalk, two or three feet\r\nhigh, with smaller leaves set here and there upon it. At the top\r\nthereof grow many small yellow flowers, one above another, in long\r\nspikes; after which come rough heads of seed, hanging downwards, which\r\nwill cleave to and stick upon garments, or any thing that shall rub\r\nagainst them. The knot is black, long, and somewhat woody, abiding many\r\nyears, and shooting afresh every Spring; which root, though small, hath\r\na reasonable good scent.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows upon banks, near the sides of hedges.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in July and August, the seed being ripe shortly\r\nafter.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb under Jupiter, and the sign\r\nCancer; and strengthens those parts under the planet and sign, and\r\nremoves diseases in them by sympathy, and those under Saturn, Mars and\r\nMercury by antipathy, if they happen in any part of the body governed\r\nby Jupiter, or under the signs Cancer, Sagitarius or Pisces, and\r\ntherefore must needs be good for the gout, either used outwardly in oil\r\nor ointment, or inwardly in an electuary, or syrup, or concerted juice:\r\nfor which see the latter end of this book.\r\n\r\nIt is of a cleansing and cutting faculty, without any manifest heat,\r\nmoderately drying and binding. It opens and cleanses the liver, helps\r\nthe jaundice, and is very beneficial to the bowels, healing all inward\r\nwounds, bruises, hurts, and other distempers. The decoction of the herb\r\nmade with wine, and drank, is good against the biting and stinging of\r\nserpents, and helps them that make foul, troubled or bloody water.\r\n\r\nThis herb also helps the cholic, cleanses the breast, and rids away\r\nthe cough. A draught of the decoction taken warm before the fit,\r\nfirst removes, and in time rids away the tertian or quartan agues.\r\nThe leaves and seeds taken in wine, stays the bloody flux; outwardly\r\napplied, being stamped with old swine’s grease, it helps old sores,\r\ncancers, and inveterate ulcers, and draws forth thorns and splinters\r\nof wood, nails, or any other such things gotten in the flesh. It helps\r\nto strengthen the members that be out of joint: and being bruised and\r\napplied, or the juice dropped in it, helps foul and imposthumed ears.\r\n\r\nThe distilled water of the herb is good to all the said purposes,\r\neither inward or outward, but a great deal weaker.\r\n\r\nIt is a most admirable remedy for such whose livers are annoyed either\r\nby heat or cold. The liver is the former of blood, and blood the\r\nnourisher of the body, and Agrimony a strengthener of the liver.\r\n\r\nI cannot stand to give you a reason in every herb why it cures such\r\ndiseases; but if you please to pursue my judgment in the herb Wormwood,\r\nyou shall find them there, and it will be well worth your while to\r\nconsider it in every herb, you shall find them true throughout the book.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WATER AGRIMONY.\r\n\r\nIT is called in some countries, Water Hemp, Bastard Hemp, and Bastard\r\nAgrimony, Eupatorium, and Hepatorium, because it strengthens the liver.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The root continues a long time, having many long slender\r\nstrings. The stalk grows up about two feet high, sometimes higher.\r\nThey are of a dark purple colour. The branches are many, growing at\r\ndistances the one from the other, the one from the one side of the\r\nstalk, the other from the opposite point. The leaves are fringed,\r\nand much indented at the edges. The flowers grow at the top of the\r\nbranches, of a brown yellow colour, spotted with black spots, having\r\na substance within the midst of them like that of a Daisy: If you rub\r\nthem between your fingers, they smell like rosin or cedar when it is\r\nburnt. The seeds are long, and easily stick to any woollen thing they\r\ntouch.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They delight not in heat, and therefore they are not so\r\nfrequently found in the Southern parts of England as in the Northern,\r\nwhere they grow frequently: You may look for them in cold grounds, by\r\nponds and ditches’ sides, and also by running waters; sometimes you\r\nshall find them grow in the midst of waters.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They all flower in July or August, and the seed is ripe\r\npresently after.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a plant of Jupiter, as well as the\r\nother Agrimony, only this belongs to the celestial sign Cancer. It\r\nheals and dries, cuts and cleanses thick and tough humours of the\r\nbreast, and for this I hold it inferior to but few herbs that grow.\r\nIt helps the cachexia or evil disposition of the body, the dropsy and\r\nyellow-jaundice. It opens obstructions of the liver, mollifies the\r\nhardness of the spleen, being applied outwardly. It breaks imposthumes\r\naway inwardly: It is an excellent remedy for the third day ague. It\r\nprovokes urine and the terms; it kills worms, and cleanses the body of\r\nsharp humours, which are the cause of itch and scabs; the herb being\r\nburnt, the smoke thereof drives away flies, wasps, &c. It strengthens\r\nthe lungs exceedingly. Country people give it to their cattle when they\r\nare troubled with the cough, or broken-winded.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ALEHOOF, OR GROUND-IVY.\r\n\r\nSEVERAL counties give it different names, so that there is scarcely\r\nany herb growing of that bigness that has got so many: It is called\r\nCat’s-foot, Ground-ivy, Gill-go-by-ground, and Gill-creep-by-ground,\r\nTurn-hoof, Haymaids, and Alehoof.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] This well known herb lies, spreads and creeps upon the\r\nground, shoots forth roots, at the corners of tender jointed stalks,\r\nset with two round leaves at every joint somewhat hairy, crumpled\r\nand unevenly dented about the edges with round dents; at the joints\r\nlikewise, with the leaves towards the end of the branches, come forth\r\nhollow, long flowers, of a blueish purple colour, with small white\r\nspots upon the lips that hang down. The root is small with strings.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It is commonly found under hedges, and on the sides of\r\nditches, under houses, or in shadowed lanes, and other waste grounds,\r\nin almost every part of this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower somewhat early, and abide a great while; the\r\nleaves continue green until Winter, and sometimes abide, except the\r\nWinter be very sharp and cold.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of Venus, and therefore cures\r\nthe diseases she causes by sympathy, and those of Mars by antipathy;\r\nyou may usually find it all the year long except the year be extremely\r\nfrosty; it is quick, sharp, and bitter in taste, and is thereby found\r\nto be hot and dry; a singular herb for all inward wounds, exulcerated\r\nlungs, or other parts, either by itself, or boiled with other the like\r\nherbs; and being drank, in a short time it eases all griping pains,\r\nwindy and choleric humours in the stomach, spleen or belly; helps the\r\nyellow jaundice, by opening the stoppings of the gall and liver, and\r\nmelancholy, by opening the stoppings of the spleen; expels venom or\r\npoison, and also the plague; it provokes urine and women’s courses; the\r\ndecoction of it in wine drank for some time together, procures ease\r\nto them that are troubled with the sciatica, or hip-gout: as also the\r\ngout in hands, knees or feet; if you put to the decoction some honey\r\nand a little burnt alum, it is excellently good to gargle any sore\r\nmouth or throat, and to wash the sores and ulcers in the privy parts of\r\nman or woman; it speedily helps green wounds, being bruised and bound\r\nthereto. The juice of it boiled with a little honey and verdigrease,\r\ndoth wonderfully cleanse fistulas, ulcers, and stays the spreading or\r\neating of cancers and ulcers; it helps the itch, scabs, wheals, and\r\nother breakings out in any part of the body. The juice of Celandine,\r\nField-daisies, and Ground-ivy clarified, and a little fine sugar\r\ndissolved therein, and dropped into the eyes, is a sovereign remedy\r\nfor all pains, redness, and watering of them; as also for the pin and\r\nweb, skins and films growing over the sight, it helps beasts as well as\r\nmen. The juice dropped into the ears, wonderfully helps the noise and\r\nsinging of them, and helps the hearing which is decayed. It is good to\r\ntun up with new drink, for it will clarify it in a night, that it will\r\nbe the fitter to be drank the next morning; or if any drink be thick\r\nwith removing, or any other accident, it will do the like in a few\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ALEXANDER.\r\n\r\nIT is called Alisander, Horse-parsley, and Wild-parsley, and the Black\r\nPot-herb; the seed of it is that which is usually sold in apothecaries’\r\nshops for Macedonian Parsley-seed.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] It is usually sown in all the gardens in Europe, and so\r\nwell known, that it needs no farther description.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in June and July; the seed is ripe in August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of Jupiter, and therefore\r\nfriendly to nature, for it warms a cold stomach, and opens a stoppage\r\nof the liver and spleen; it is good to move women’s courses, to\r\nexpel the afterbirth, to break wind, to provoke urine, and helps the\r\nstranguary; and these things the seeds will do likewise. If either of\r\nthem be boiled in wine, or being bruised and taken in wine, is also\r\neffectual against the biting of serpents. And you know what Alexander\r\npottage is good for, that you may no longer eat it out of ignorance but\r\nout of knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE BLACK ALDER-TREE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS tree seldom grows to any great bigness, but for the\r\nmost part abideth like a hedge-bush, or a tree spreading its branches,\r\nthe woods of the body being white, and a dark red colet or heart; the\r\noutward bark is of a blackish colour, with many whitish spots therein;\r\nbut the inner bark next the wood is yellow, which being chewed, will\r\nturn the spittle near into a saffron colour. The leaves are somewhat\r\nlike those of an ordinary Alder-tree, or the Female Cornet, or\r\nDogberry-tree, called in Sussex Dog-wood, but blacker, and not so long.\r\nThe flowers are white, coming forth with the leaves at the joints,\r\nwhich turn into small round berries, first green, afterwards red, but\r\nblackish when they are thorough ripe, divided, as it were, into two\r\nparts, wherein is contained two small round and flat seeds. The root\r\nrunneth not deep into the ground, but spreads rather under the upper\r\ncrust of the earth.\r\n\r\n_Place._] This tree or shrub may be found plentifully in St. John’s\r\nWood by Hornsey, and the woods upon Hampstead Heath; as also a wood\r\ncalled the Old Park, in Barcomb, in Essex, near the brook’s sides.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in May, and the berries are ripe in September.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a tree of Venus, and perhaps under the\r\ncelestial sign Cancer. The inner yellow bark hereof purges downwards\r\nboth choler and phlegm, and the watery humours of such that have the\r\ndropsy, and strengthens the inward parts again by binding. If the\r\nbark hereof be boiled with Agrimony, Wormwood, Dodder, Hops, and some\r\nFennel, with Smallage, Endive, and Succory-roots, and a reasonable\r\ndraught taken every morning for some time together, it is very\r\neffectual against the jaundice, dropsy, and the evil disposition of the\r\nbody, especially if some suitable purging medicines have been taken\r\nbefore, to void the grosser excrements: It purges and strengthens the\r\nliver and spleen, cleansing them from such evil humours and hardness as\r\nthey are afflicted with. It is to be understood that these things are\r\nperformed by the dried bark; for the fresh green bark taken inwardly\r\nprovokes strong vomitings, pains in the stomach, and gripings in the\r\nbelly; yet if the decoction may stand and settle two or three days,\r\nuntil the yellow colour be changed black, it will not work so strongly\r\nas before, but will strengthen the stomach, and procure an appetite to\r\nmeat. The outward bark contrariwise doth bind the body, and is helpful\r\nfor all lasks and fluxes thereof, but this also must be dried first,\r\nwhereby it will work the better. The inner bark thereof boiled in\r\nvinegar is an approved remedy to kill lice, to cure the itch, and take\r\naway scabs, by drying them up in a short time. It is singularly good to\r\nwash the teeth, to take away the pains, to fasten those that are loose,\r\nto cleanse them, and to keep them sound. The leaves are good fodder for\r\nkine, to make them give more milk.\r\n\r\nIf in the Spring-time you use the herbs before mentioned, and will take\r\nbut a handful of each of them, and to them add an handful of Elder\r\nbuds, and having bruised them all, boil them in a gallon of ordinary\r\nbeer, when it is new; and having boiled them half an hour, add to this\r\nthree gallons more, and let them work together, and drink a draught of\r\nit every morning, half a pint or thereabouts; it is an excellent purge\r\nfor the Spring, to consume the phlegmatic quality the Winter hath left\r\nbehind it, and withal to keep your body in health, and consume those\r\nevil humours which the heat of Summer will readily stir up. Esteem it\r\nas a jewel.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE COMMON ALDER-TREE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS grows to a reasonable height, and spreads much if\r\nit like the place. It is so generally known to country people, that I\r\nconceive it needless to tell that which is no news.\r\n\r\n_Place and Time._] It delights to grow in moist woods, and watery\r\nplaces; flowering in April or May, and yielding ripe seed in September.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a tree under the dominion of Venus,\r\nand of some watery sign or others, I suppose Pisces; and therefore\r\nthe decoction, or distilled water of the leaves, is excellent against\r\nburnings and inflammations, either with wounds or without, to bathe the\r\nplace grieved with, and especially for that inflammation in the breast,\r\nwhich the vulgar call an ague.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot get the leaves (as in Winter it is impossible) make use\r\nof the bark in the same manner.\r\n\r\nThe leaves and bark of the Alder-tree are cooling, drying, and\r\nbinding. The fresh leaves, laid upon swellings, dissolve them, and\r\nstay the inflammation. The leaves put under the bare feet galled with\r\ntravelling, are a great refreshing to them. The said leaves, gathered\r\nwhile the morning dew is on them, and brought into a chamber troubled\r\nwith fleas, will gather them thereunto, which being suddenly cast out,\r\nwill rid the chamber of those troublesome bed-fellows.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ANGELICA.\r\n\r\nTO write a discription of that which is so well known to be growing\r\nalmost in every garden, I suppose is altogether needless; yet for its\r\nvirtue it is of admirable use.\r\n\r\nIn time of Heathenism, when men had found out any excellent herb,\r\nthey dedicated it to their gods; as the bay-tree to Apollo, the Oak\r\nto Jupiter, the Vine to Bacchus, the Poplar to Hercules. These the\r\nidolators following as the Patriarchs they dedicate to their Saints;\r\nas our Lady’s Thistle to the Blessed Virgin, St. John’s Wort to St.\r\nJohn and another Wort to St. Peter, &c. Our physicians must imitate\r\nlike apes (though they cannot come off half so cleverly) for they\r\nblasphemously call Phansies or Hearts-ease, _an herb of the Trinity_,\r\nbecause it is of three colours; and a certain ointment, _an ointment\r\nof the Apostles_, because it consists of twelve ingredients. Alas I am\r\nsorry for their folly, and grieved at their blasphemy, God send them\r\nwisdom the rest of their age, for they have their share of ignorance\r\nalready. Oh! Why must ours be blasphemous, because the Heathens and\r\ninfidels were idolatrous? Certainly they have read so much in old\r\nrusty authors, that they have lost all their divinity; for unless it\r\nwere amongst the Ranters, I never read or heard of such blasphemy. The\r\nHeathens and infidels were bad, and ours worse; the idolaters give\r\nidolatrous names to herbs for their virtues sake, not for their fair\r\nlooks; and therefore some called this an herb of the _Holy Ghost_;\r\nothers, more moderate, called it Angelica, because of its angelical\r\nvirtues, and that name it retains still, and all nations follow it so\r\nnear as their dialect will permit.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of the Sun in Leo; let it be\r\ngathered when he is there, the Moon applying to his good aspect; let\r\nit be gathered either in his hour, or in the hour of Jupiter, let Sol\r\nbe angular; observe the like in gathering the herbs of other planets,\r\nand you may happen to do wonders. In all epidemical diseases caused by\r\nSaturn, that is as good a preservative as grows: It resists poison,\r\nby defending and comforting the heart, blood, and spirits; it doth\r\nthe like against the plague and all epidemical diseases, if the root\r\nbe taken in powder to the weight of half a dram at a time, with some\r\ngood treacle in Carduus water, and the party thereupon laid to sweat\r\nin his bed; if treacle be not to be had take it alone in Carduus or\r\nAngelica-water. The stalks or roots candied and eaten fasting, are good\r\npreservatives in time of infection; and at other times to warm and\r\ncomfort a cold stomach. The root also steeped in vinegar, and a little\r\nof that vinegar taken sometimes fasting, and the root smelled unto, is\r\ngood for the same purpose. A water distilled from the root simply, as\r\nsteeped in wine, and distilled in a glass, is much more effectual than\r\nthe water of the leaves; and this water, drank two or three spoonfuls\r\nat a time, easeth all pains and torments coming of cold and wind, so\r\nthat the body be not bound; and taken with some of the root in powder\r\nat the beginning, helpeth the pleurisy, as also all other diseases of\r\nthe lungs and breast, as coughs, phthysic, and shortness of breath;\r\nand a syrup of the stalks do the like. It helps pains of the cholic,\r\nthe stranguary and stoppage of the urine, procureth womens’ courses,\r\nand expelleth the after-birth, openeth the stoppings of the liver and\r\nspleen, and briefly easeth and discusseth all windiness and inward\r\nswellings. The decoction drank before the fit of an ague, that they\r\nmay sweat (if possible) before the fit comes, will, in two or three\r\ntimes taking, rid it quite away; it helps digestion and is a remedy\r\nfor a surfeit. The juice or the water, being dropped into the eyes\r\nor ears, helps dimness of sight and deafness; the juice put into the\r\nhollow teeth, easeth their pains. The root in powder, made up into a\r\nplaster with a little pitch, and laid on the biting of mad dogs, or any\r\nother venomous creature, doth wonderfully help. The juice or the waters\r\ndropped, or tent wet therein, and put into filthy dead ulcers, or the\r\npowder of the root (in want of either) doth cleanse and cause them to\r\nheal quickly, by covering the naked bones with flesh; the distilled\r\nwater applied to places pained with the gout, or sciatica, doth give a\r\ngreat deal of ease.\r\n\r\nThe wild Angelica is not so effectual as the garden; although it may be\r\nsafely used to all the purposes aforesaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n    AMARANTHUS.\r\n\r\nBESIDES its common name, by which it is best known by the florists of\r\nour days, it is called Flower Gentle, Flower Velure Floramor, and\r\nVelvet Flower.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] It being a garden flower, and well known to every one\r\nthat keeps it, I might forbear the description; yet, notwithstanding,\r\nbecause some desire it, I shall give it. It runs up with a stalk a\r\ncubit high, streaked, and somewhat reddish towards the root, but very\r\nsmooth, divided towards the top with small branches, among which stand\r\nlong broad leaves of a reddish green colour, slippery; the flowers are\r\nnot properly flowers, but tuffs, very beautiful to behold, but of no\r\nsmell, of reddish colour; if you bruise them, they yield juice of the\r\nsame colour, being gathered, they keep their beauty a long time; the\r\nseed is of a shining black colour.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They continue in flower from August till the time the frost\r\nnips them.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of Saturn, and is\r\nan excellent qualifier of the unruly actions and passions of Venus,\r\nthough Mars also should join with her. The flowers dried and beaten\r\ninto powder, stop the terms in women, and so do almost all other red\r\nthings. And by the icon, or image of every herb, the ancients at\r\nfirst found out their virtues. Modern writers laugh at them for it;\r\nbut I wonder in my heart, how the virtues of herbs came at first to\r\nbe known, if not by their signatures; the moderns have them from the\r\nwritings of the ancients; the ancients had no writings to have them\r\nfrom: but to proceed. The flowers stop all fluxes of blood; whether in\r\nman or woman, bleeding either at the nose or wound. There is also a\r\nsort of Amaranthus that bears a white flower, which stops the whites\r\nin women, and the running of the reins in men, and is a most gallant\r\nantivenereal, and a singular remedy for the French pox.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ANEMONE.\r\n\r\nCALLED also Wind flower, because they say the flowers never open but\r\nwhen the wind blows. Pliny is my author; if it be not so, blame him.\r\nThe seed also (if it bears any at all) flies away with the wind.\r\n\r\n_Place and Time._] They are sown usually in the gardens of the curious,\r\nand flower in the Spring-time. As for discription I shall pass it,\r\nbeing well known to all those that sow them.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of Mars, being\r\nsupposed to be a kind of Crow-foot. The leaves provoke the terms\r\nmightily, being boiled, and the decoction drank. The body being bathed\r\nwith the decoction of them, cures the leprosy. The leaves being stamped\r\nand the juice snuffed up in the nose, purges the head mightily; so does\r\nthe root, being chewed in the mouth, for it procures much spitting,\r\nand brings away many watery and phlegmatic humours, and is therefore\r\nexcellent for the lethargy. And when all is done, let physicians prate\r\nwhat they please, all the pills in the dispensatory purge not the head\r\nlike to hot things held in the mouth. Being made into an ointment,\r\nand the eyelids anointed with it, it helps inflammations of the eyes,\r\nwhereby it is palpable, that every stronger draws its weaker like. The\r\nsame ointment is excellently good to cleanse malignant and corroding\r\nulcers.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GARDEN ARRACH.\r\n\r\nCALLED also Orach, and Arage; it is cultivated for domestic uses.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] It is so commonly known to every housewife, it were labour\r\nlost to describe it.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers and seeds from June to the end of August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the government of the Moon; in\r\nquality cold and moist like unto her. It softens and loosens the body\r\nof man being eaten, and fortifies the expulsive faculty in him. The\r\nherb, whether it be bruised and applied to the throat, or boiled, and\r\nin like manner applied, it matters not much, it is excellently good\r\nfor swellings in the throat: the best way, I suppose, is to boil it,\r\napply the herb outwardly: the decoction of it, besides, is an excellent\r\nremedy for the yellow jaundice.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ARRACH, WILD AND STINKING.\r\n\r\nCALLED also Vulvaria, from that part of the body upon which the\r\noperation is most; also Dog’s Arrach, Goat’s Arrach, and Stinking\r\nMotherwort.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] This has small and almost round leaves, yet a little\r\npointed and without dent or cut, of a dusky mealy colour, growing on\r\nthe slender stalks and branches that spread on the ground, with small\r\nflowers set with the leaves, and small seeds succeeding like the rest,\r\nperishing yearly, and rising again with its own sowing. It smells like\r\nrotten fish, or something worse.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows usually upon dunghills.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in June and July, and their seed is ripe quickly\r\nafter.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Stinking Arrach is used as a remedy to\r\nwomen pained, and almost strangled with the mother, by smelling to\r\nit; but inwardly taken there is no better remedy under the moon for\r\nthat disease. I would be large in commendation of this herb, were I\r\nbut eloquent. It is an herb under the dominion of Venus, and under the\r\nsign Scorpio; it is common almost upon every dunghill. The works of\r\nGod are freely given to man, his medicines are common and cheap, and\r\neasily to be found. I commend it for an universal medicine for the\r\nwomb, and such a medicine as will easily, safely, and speedily cure any\r\ndisease thereof, as the fits of the mother, dislocation, or falling out\r\nthereof; cools the womb being over-heated. And let me tell you this,\r\nand I will tell you the truth, heat of the womb is one of the greatest\r\ncauses of hard labour in child-birth. It makes barren women fruitful.\r\nIt cleanseth the womb if it be foul, and strengthens it exceedingly;\r\nit provokes the terms if they be stopped, and stops them if they flow\r\nimmoderately; you can desire no good to your womb, but this herb will\r\naffect it; therefore if you love children, if you love health, if you\r\nlove ease, keep a syrup always by you, made of the juice of this herb,\r\nand sugar (or honey, if it be to cleanse the womb), and let such as be\r\nrich keep it for their poor neighbours; and bestow it as freely as I\r\nbestow my studies upon them, or else let them look to answer it another\r\nday, when the Lord shall come to make inquisition for blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ARCHANGEL.\r\n\r\nTO put a gloss upon their practice, the physicians call a herb (which\r\ncountry people vulgarly know by the name of Dead Nettle) Archangel;\r\nwhether they favour more of superstition or folly, I leave to the\r\njudicious reader. There is more curiosity than courtesy to my\r\ncountrymen used by others in the explanation as well of the names, as\r\ndiscription of this so well known herb; which that I may not also be\r\nguilty of, take this short discription: first, of the Red Archangel.\r\nThis is likewise called Bee Nettle.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] This has divers square stalks, somewhat hairy, at the\r\njoints whereof grow two sad green leaves dented about the edges,\r\nopposite to one another to the lowermost, upon long foot stalks, but\r\nwithout any toward the tops, which are somewhat round, yet pointed, and\r\na little crumpled and hairy; round about the upper joints, where the\r\nleaves grow thick, are sundry gaping flowers of a pale reddish colour;\r\nafter which come the seeds three or four in a husk. The root is small\r\nand thready, perishing every year; the whole plant hath a strong smell\r\nbut not stinking.\r\n\r\nWhite Archangel hath divers square stalks, none standing straight\r\nupward, but bending downward, whereon stand two leaves at a joint,\r\nlarger and more pointed than the other, dented about the edges, and\r\ngreener also, more like unto Nettle leaves, but not stinking, yet\r\nhairy. At the joints, with the leaves, stand larger and more open\r\ngaping white flowers, husks round about the stalks, but not with such a\r\nbush of leaves as flowers set in the top, as is on the other, wherein\r\nstand small roundish black seeds: the root is white, with many strings\r\nat it, not growing downward but lying under the upper crust of the\r\nearth, and abides many years increasing; this has not so strong a scent\r\nas the former.\r\n\r\nYellow Archangel is like the White in the stalks and leaves; but that\r\nthe stalks are more straight and upright, and the joints with leaves\r\nare farther asunder, having longer leaves than the former, and the\r\nflowers a little larger and more gaping, of a fair yellow colour in\r\nmost, in some paler. The roots are like the white, only they creep not\r\nso much under the ground.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow almost every where (unless it be in the middle of\r\nthe street), the yellow most usually in the wet grounds of woods, and\r\nsometimes in the dryer, in divers counties of this nation.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower from the beginning of the Spring all the Summer\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The Archangels are somewhat hot and drier\r\nthan the stinging Nettles, and used with better success for the\r\nstopping and hardness of the spleen, than they, by using the decoction\r\nof the herb in wine, and afterwards applying the herb hot into the\r\nregion of the spleen as a plaister, or the decoction with spunges.\r\nFlowers of the White Archangel are preserved or conserved to be used\r\nto stay the whites, and the flowers of the red to stay the reds in\r\nwomen. It makes the heart merry, drives away melancholy, quickens the\r\nspirits, is good against quartan agues, stancheth bleeding at mouth\r\nand nose, if it be stamped and applied to the nape of the neck; the\r\nherb also bruised, and with some salt and vinegar and hog’s-grease,\r\nlaid upon a hard tumour or swelling, or that vulgarly called the\r\nking’s evil, do help to dissolve or discuss them; and being in like\r\nmanner applied, doth much allay the pains, and give ease to the gout,\r\nsciatica, and other pains of the joints and sinews. It is also very\r\neffectual to heal green wounds, and old ulcers; also to stay their\r\nfretting, gnawing, and spreading. It draws forth splinters, and such\r\nlike things gotten into the flesh, and is very good against bruises and\r\nburnings. But the Yellow Archangel is most commended for old, filthy,\r\ncorrupt sores and ulcers, yea although they grow to be hollow, and to\r\ndissolve tumours. The chief use of them is for women, it being a herb\r\nof Venus.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ARSSMART.\r\n\r\nThe hot Arssmart is called also Water-pepper, or Culrage. The mild\r\nArssmart is called dead Arssmart Persicaria, or Peach-wort, because\r\nthe leaves are so like the leaves of a peach-tree; it is also called\r\nPlumbago.\r\n\r\n_Description of the mild._] This has broad leaves set at the great red\r\njoint of the stalks; with semicircular blackish marks on them, usually\r\neither blueish or whitish, with such like seed following. The root is\r\nlong, with many strings thereat, perishing yearly; this has no sharp\r\ntaste (as another sort has, which is quick and biting) but rather sour\r\nlike sorrel, or else a little drying, or without taste.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in watery places, ditches, and the like, which for\r\nthe most part are dry in summer.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in June, and the seed is ripe in August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] As the virtue of both these is various, so\r\nis also their government; for that which is hot and biting, is under\r\nthe dominion of Mars, but Saturn, challenges the other, as appears by\r\nthat leaden coloured spot he hath placed upon the leaf.\r\n\r\nIt is of a cooling and drying quality, and very effectual for putrified\r\nulcers in man or beast, to kill worms, and cleanse the putrified\r\nplaces. The juice thereof dropped in, or otherwise applied, consumes\r\nall colds, swellings, and dissolveth the congealed blood of bruises by\r\nstrokes, falls, &c. A piece of the root, or some of the seeds bruised,\r\nand held to an aching tooth, takes away the pain. The leaves bruised\r\nand laid to the joint that has a felon thereon, takes it away. The\r\njuice destroys worms in the ears, being dropped into them; if the hot\r\nArssmart be strewed in a chamber, it will soon kill all the fleas;\r\nand the herb or juice of the cold Arssmart, put to a horse or other\r\ncattle’s sores, will drive away the fly in the hottest time of Summer;\r\na good handful of the hot biting Arssmart put under a horse’s saddle,\r\nwill make him travel the better, although he were half tired before.\r\nThe mild Arssmart is good against all imposthumes and inflammations at\r\nthe beginning, and to heal green wounds.\r\n\r\nAll authors chop the virtues of both sorts of Arssmart together, as men\r\nchop herbs for the pot, when both of them are of contrary qualities.\r\nThe hot Arssmart grows not so high or tall as the mild doth, but\r\nhas many leaves of the colour of peach leaves, very seldom or never\r\nspotted; in other particulars it is like the former, but may easily be\r\nknown from it, if you will but be pleased to break a leaf of it cross\r\nyour tongue, for the hot will make your tongue to smart, but the cold\r\nwill not. If you see them both together, you may easily distinguish\r\nthem, because the mild hath far broader leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ASARABACCA.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] ASARABACCA appears like an evergreen, keeping its leaves\r\nall the Winter, but putting forth new ones in the time of Spring. It\r\nhas many heads rising from the roots, from whence come many smooth\r\nleaves, every one upon his foot stalks, which are rounder and bigger\r\nthan Violet leaves, thicker also, and of a dark green shining colour\r\non the upper side, and of a pale yellow green underneath, little or\r\nnothing dented about the edges, from among which rise small, round,\r\nhollow, brown green husks, upon short stalks, about an inch long,\r\ndivided at the brims into five divisions, very like the cups or heads\r\nof the Henbane seed, but that they are smaller; and these be all the\r\nflower it carries, which are somewhat sweet, being smelled to, and\r\nwherein, when they are ripe, is contained small cornered rough seeds,\r\nvery like the kernels or stones of grapes or raisins. The roots are\r\nsmall and whitish, spreading divers ways in the ground, increasing into\r\ndivers heads; but not running or creeping under the ground, as some\r\nother creeping herbs do. They are somewhat sweet in smell, resembling\r\nNardus, but more when they are dry than green; and of a sharp and not\r\nunpleasant taste.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows frequently in gardens.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They keep their leaves green all Winter; but shoot forth new\r\nin the Spring, and with them come forth those heads or flowers which\r\ngive ripe seed about Midsummer, or somewhat after.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a plant under the dominion of Mars,\r\nand therefore inimical to nature. This herb being drank, not only\r\nprovokes vomiting, but purges downwards, and by urine also, purges\r\nboth choler and phlegm: If you add to it some spikenard, with the\r\nwhey of goat’s milk, or honeyed water, it is made more strong, but\r\nit purges phlegm more manifestly than choler, and therefore does\r\nmuch help pains in the hips, and other parts; being boiled in whey,\r\nit wonderfully helps the obstructions of the liver and spleen, and\r\ntherefore profitable for the dropsy and jaundice; being steeped in\r\nwine and drank, it helps those continual agues that come by the plenty\r\nof stubborn humours; an oil made thereof by setting in the sun, with\r\nsome laudanum added to it, provokes sweating (the ridge of the back\r\nbeing anointed therewith), and thereby drives away the shaking fits of\r\nthe ague. It will not abide any long boiling, for it loseth its chief\r\nstrength thereby; nor much beating, for the finer powder provokes\r\nvomits and urine, and the coarser purgeth downwards.\r\n\r\nThe common use hereof is, to take the juice of five or seven leaves in\r\na little drink to cause vomiting; the roots have also the same virtue,\r\nthough they do not operate so forcibly; they are very effectual against\r\nthe biting of serpents, and therefore are put as an ingredient both\r\ninto Mithridite and Venice treacle. The leaves and roots being boiled\r\nin lye, and the head often washed therewith while it is warm, comforts\r\nthe head and brain that is ill affected by taking cold, and helps the\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nI shall desire ignorant people to forbear the use of the leaves; the\r\nroots purge more gently, and may prove beneficial to such as have\r\ncancers, or old putrified ulcers, or fistulas upon their bodies, to\r\ntake a dram of them in powder in a quarter of a pint of white wine\r\nin the morning. The truth is, I fancy purging and vomiting medicines\r\nas little as any man breathing doth, for they weaken nature, nor\r\nshall ever advise them to be used, unless upon urgent necessity. If\r\na physician be nature’s servant, it is his duty to strengthen his\r\nmistress as much as he can, and weaken her as little as may be.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ASPARAGUS, SPARAGUS, OR SPERAGE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] IT rises up at first with divers white and green scaly\r\nheads, very brittle or easy to break while they are young, which\r\nafterwards rise up in very long and slender green stalks of the bigness\r\nof an ordinary riding wand, at the bottom of most, or bigger, or\r\nlesser, as the roots are of growth; on which are set divers branches of\r\ngreen leaves shorter and smaller than fennel to the top; at the joints\r\nwhereof come forth small yellowish flowers, which turn into round\r\nberries, green at first and of an excellent red colour when they are\r\nripe, shewing like bead or coral, wherein are contained exceeding hard\r\nblack seeds; the roots are dispersed from a spongeous head into many\r\nlong, thick, and round strings, wherein is sucked much nourishment out\r\nof the ground, and increaseth plentifully thereby.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PRICKLY ASPARAGUS, OR SPERAGE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS grows usually in gardens, and some of it grows\r\nwild in Appleton meadows in Gloucestershire, where the poor people\r\ngather the buds of young shoots, and sell them cheaper that our garden\r\nAsparagus is sold in London.\r\n\r\n_Time._] For the most part they flower, and bear their berries late in\r\nthe year, or not at all, although they are housed in Winter.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] They are both under the dominion of Jupiter.\r\nThe young buds or branches boiled in ordinary broth, make the belly\r\nsoluble and open, and boiled in white wine, provoke urine, being\r\nstopped, and is good against the stranguary or difficulty of making\r\nwater; it expelleth the gravel and stone out of the kidneys, and\r\nhelpeth pains in the reins. And boiled in white wine or vinegar, it is\r\nprevalent for them that have their arteries loosened, or are troubled\r\nwith the hip-gout or sciatica. The decoction of the roots boiled in\r\nwine and taken, is good to clear the sight, and being held in the mouth\r\neaseth the toothache. The garden asparagus nourisheth more than the\r\nwild, yet hath it the same effects in all the afore-mentioned diseases.\r\nThe decoction of the root in white wine, and the back and belly bathed\r\ntherewith, or kneeling or lying down in the same, or sitting therein\r\nas a bath, has been found effectual against pains of the reins and\r\nbladder, pains of the mother and cholic, and generally against all\r\npains that happen to the lower parts of the body, and no less effectual\r\nagainst stiff and benumbed sinews, or those that are shrunk by cramps\r\nand convulsions, and helps the sciatica.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ASH TREE.\r\n\r\nThis is so well known, that time would be misspent in writing a\r\ndescription of it; therefore I shall only insist upon the virtues of it.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is governed by the Sun: and the young\r\ntender tops, with the leaves, taken inwardly, and some of them\r\noutwardly applied, are singularly good against the bitings of viper,\r\nadder, or any other venomous beast; and the water distilled therefrom\r\nbeing taken, a small quantity every morning fasting, is a singular\r\nmedicine for those that are subject to dropsy, or to abate the\r\ngreatness of those that are too gross or fat. The decoction of the\r\nleaves in white wine helps to break the stone, and expel it, and cures\r\nthe jaundice. The ashes of the bark of the Ash made into lye, and those\r\nheads bathed therewith which are leprous, scabby, or scald, they are\r\nthereby cured. The kernels within the husks, commonly called Ashen\r\nKeys, prevail against stitches and pains in the sides, proceeding of\r\nwind, and voideth away the stone by provoking urine.\r\n\r\nI can justly except against none of all this, save only the first,\r\n_viz._ That Ash-tree tops and leaves are good against the bitings of\r\nserpents and vipers. I suppose this had its rise from Gerrard or Pliny,\r\nboth which hold that there is such an antipathy between an adder\r\nand an Ash-tree, that if an adder be encompassed round with Ash-tree\r\nleaves, she will sooner run through the fire than through the leaves:\r\nThe contrary to which is the truth, as both my eyes are witnesses. The\r\nrest are virtues something likely, only if it be in Winter when you\r\ncannot get the leaves, you may safely use the bark instead of them. The\r\nkeys you may easily keep all the year, gathering them when they are\r\nripe.\r\n\r\n\r\n    AVENS, CALLED ALSO COLEWORT, AND\r\n    HERB BONET.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The ordinary Avens hath many long, rough, dark green,\r\nwinged leaves, rising from the root, every one made of many leaves set\r\non each side of the middle rib, the largest three whereof grow at the\r\nend, and are snipped or dented round about the edges; the other being\r\nsmall pieces, sometimes two and sometimes four, standing on each side\r\nof the middle rib underneath them. Among which do rise up divers rough\r\nor hairy stalks about two feet high, branching forth with leaves at\r\nevery joint not so long as those below, but almost as much cut in on\r\nthe edges, some into three parts, some into more. On the tops of the\r\nbranches stand small, pale, yellow flowers consisting of five leaves,\r\nlike the flowers of Cinquefoil, but large, in the middle whereof stand\r\na small green herb, which when the flower is fallen, grows to be round,\r\nbeing made of many long greenish purple seeds, (like grains) which will\r\nstick upon your clothes. The root consists of many brownish strings or\r\nfibres, smelling somewhat like unto cloves, especially those which grow\r\nin the higher, hotter, and drier grounds, and in free and clear air.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow wild in many places under hedge’s sides, and by the\r\npath-ways in fields; yet they rather delight to grow in shadowy than\r\nsunny places.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in May or June for the most part, and their seed\r\nis ripe in July at the farthest.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is governed by Jupiter, and that gives\r\nhopes of a wholesome healthful herb. It is good for the diseases of\r\nthe chest or breast, for pains, and stiches in the side, and to expel\r\ncrude and raw humours from the belly and stomach, by the sweet savour\r\nand warming quality. It dissolves the inward congealed blood happening\r\nby falls or bruises, and the spitting of blood, if the roots, either\r\ngreen or dry, be boiled in wine and drank; as also all manner of inward\r\nwounds or outward, if washed or bathed therewith. The decoction also\r\nbeing drank, comforts the heart, and strengthens the stomach and a cold\r\nbrain, and therefore is good in the spring times to open obstructions\r\nof the liver, and helps the wind cholic; it also helps those that have\r\nfluxes, or are bursten, or have a rupture; it takes away spots or marks\r\nin the face, being washed therewith. The juice of the fresh root, or\r\npowder of the dried root, has the same effect with the decoction. The\r\nroot in the Spring-time steeped in wine, gives it a delicate savour\r\nand taste, and being drank fasting every morning, comforts the heart,\r\nand is a good preservative against the plague, or any other poison. It\r\nhelps indigestion, and warms a cold stomach, and opens obstructions of\r\nthe liver and spleen.\r\n\r\nIt is very safe: you need have no dose prescribed; and is very fit to\r\nbe kept in every body’s house.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BALM.\r\n\r\nTHIS herb is so well known to be an inhabitant almost in every garden,\r\nthat I shall not need to write any discription thereof, although its\r\nvirtues, which are many, may not be omitted.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of Jupiter, and under Cancer,\r\nand strengthens nature much in all its actions. Let a syrup made with\r\nthe juice of it and sugar (as you shall be taught at the latter end of\r\nthis book) be kept in every gentlewoman’s house to relieve the weak\r\nstomachs and sick bodies of their poor sickly neighbours; as also the\r\nherb kept dry in the house, that so with other convenient simples, you\r\nmay make it into an electuary with honey, according as the disease\r\nis you shall be taught at the latter end of my book. The Arabian\r\nphysicians have extolled the virtues thereof to the skies; although the\r\nGreeks thought it not worth mentioning. Seraphio says, it causes the\r\nmind and heart to become merry, and revives the heart, faintings and\r\nswoonings, especially of such who are overtaken in sleep, and drives\r\naway all troublesome cares and thoughts out of the mind, arising from\r\nmelancholy or black choler; which Avicen also confirms. It is very good\r\nto help digestion, and open obstructions of the brain, and hath so\r\nmuch purging quality in it (saith Avicen) as to expel those melancholy\r\nvapours from the spirits and blood which are in the heart and arteries,\r\nalthough it cannot do so in other parts of the body. Dioscorides says,\r\nthat the leaves steeped in wine, and the wine drank, and the leaves\r\nexternally applied, is a remedy against the stings of a scorpion, and\r\nthe bitings of mad dogs; and commends the decoction thereof for women\r\nto bathe or sit in to procure their courses; it is good to wash aching\r\nteeth therewith, and profitable for those that have the bloody flux.\r\nThe leaves also, with a little nitre taken in drink, are good against\r\nthe surfeit of mushrooms, helps the griping pains of the belly; and\r\nbeing made into an electuary, it is good for them that cannot fetch\r\ntheir breath: Used with salt, it takes away wens, kernels, or hard\r\nswelling in the flesh or throat; it cleanses foul sores, and eases\r\npains of the gout. It is good for the liver and spleen. A tansy or\r\ncaudle made with eggs, and juice thereof while it is young, putting to\r\nit some sugar and rose-water, is good for a woman in child-birth, when\r\nthe after-birth is not thoroughly voided, and for their faintings upon\r\nor in their sore travail. The herb bruised and boiled in a little wine\r\nand oil, and laid warm on a boil, will ripen it, and break it.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BARBERRY.\r\n\r\nTHE shrub is so well known by every boy or girl that has but attained\r\nto the age of seven years, that it needs no description.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Mars owns the shrub, and presents it to\r\nthe use of my countrymen to purge their bodies of choler. The inner\r\nrind of the Barberry-tree boiled in white wine, and a quarter of a\r\npint drank each morning, is an excellent remedy to cleanse the body of\r\ncholeric humours, and free it from such diseases as choler causes, such\r\nas scabs, itch, tetters, ringworms, yellow jaundice, boils, &c. It is\r\nexcellent for hot agues, burnings, scaldings, heat of the blood, heat\r\nof the liver, bloody-flux; for the berries are as good as the bark,\r\nand more pleasing: they get a man a good stomach to his victuals, by\r\nstrengthening the attractive faculty which is under Mars. The hair\r\nwashed with the lye made of the tree and water, will make it turn\r\nyellow, _viz._ of Mars’ own colour. The fruit and rind of the shrub,\r\nthe flowers of broom and of heath, or furz, cleanse the body of choler\r\nby sympathy, as the flowers, leaves, and bark of the peach-tree do by\r\nantipathy, because these are under Mars, that under Venus.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BARLEY.\r\n\r\nTHE continual usefulness hereof hath made all in general so acquainted\r\nherewith that it is altogether needless to describe it, several kinds\r\nhereof plentifully growing, being yearly sown in this land. The virtues\r\nthereof take as follow.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a notable plant of Saturn: if you\r\nview diligently its effects by sympathy and antipathy, you may easily\r\nperceive a reason of them, as also why barley bread is so unwholesome\r\nfor melancholy people. Barley in all the parts and compositions thereof\r\n(except malt) is more cooling than wheat, and a little cleansing:\r\nAnd all the preparations thereof, as barley-water and other things\r\nmade thereof, give great nourishment to persons troubled with fevers,\r\nagues, and heats in the stomach: A poultice made of barley meal or\r\nflour boiled in vinegar and honey, and a few dry figs put into them,\r\ndissolves all imposthumes, and assuages inflammations, being thereto\r\napplied. And being boiled with melilot and camomile-flowers, and some\r\nlinseed, fenugreek, and rue in powder, and applied warm, it eases\r\npains in side and stomach, and windiness of the spleen. The meal of\r\nbarley and fleawort boiled in water, and made a poultice with honey and\r\noil of lilies applied warm, cures swellings under the ears, throat,\r\nneck, and such like; and a plaister made thereof with tar, with sharp\r\nvinegar into a poultice, and laid on hot, helps the leprosy; being\r\nboiled in red wine with pomegranate rinds and myrtles, stays the lask\r\nor other flux of the belly; boiled with vinegar and quince, it eases\r\nthe pains of the gout; barley-flour, white salt, honey, and vinegar\r\nmingled together, takes away the itch speedily and certainly. The\r\nwater distilled from the green barley in the end of May, is very good\r\nfor those that have defluctions of humours fallen into their eyes,\r\nand eases the pain, being dropped into them; or white bread steeped\r\ntherein, and bound on the eyes, does the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GARDEN BAZIL, OR SWEET BAZIL.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THE greater of Ordinary Bazil rises up usually with one\r\nupright stalk, diversly branching forth on all sides, with two leaves\r\nat every joint, which are somewhat broad and round, yet pointed, of a\r\npale green colour, but fresh; a little snipped about the edges, and of\r\na strong healthy scent. The flowers are small and white, and standing\r\nat the tops of the branches, with two small leaves at the joints, in\r\nsome places green, in others brown, after which come black seed. The\r\nroot perishes at the approach of Winter, and therefore must be new sown\r\nevery year.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in gardens.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It must be sowed late, and flowers in the heart of Summer,\r\nbeing a very tender plant.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] This is the herb which all authors are\r\ntogether by the ears about, and rail at one another (like lawyers).\r\nGalen and Dioscorides hold it not fit to be taken inwardly; and\r\nChrysippus rails at it with downright Billingsgate rhetoric; Pliny, and\r\nthe Arabian physicians defend it.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I presently found that speech true:\r\n\r\n    _Non nostrium inter nos tantas componere lites._\r\n\r\nAnd away to Dr. Reason went I, who told me it was an herb of Mars, and\r\nunder the Scorpion, and perhaps therefore called Basilicon; and it is\r\nno marvel if it carry a kind of virulent quality with it. Being applied\r\nto the place bitten by venomous beasts, or stung by a wasp or hornet,\r\nit speedily draws the poison to it; _Every like draws his like._\r\nMizaldus affirms, that, being laid to rot in horse-dung, it will breed\r\nvenomous beasts. Hilarius, a French physician, affirms upon his own\r\nknowledge, that an acquaintance of his, by common smelling to it, had a\r\nscorpion bred in his brain. Something is the matter; this herb and rue\r\nwill not grow together, no, nor near one another: and we know rue is as\r\ngreat an enemy to poison as any that grows.\r\n\r\nTo conclude; It expels both birth and after-birth; and as it helps\r\nthe deficiency of Venus in one kind, so it spoils all her actions in\r\nanother. I dare write no more of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE BAY TREE.\r\n\r\nTHIS is so well known that it needs no description: I shall therefore\r\nonly write the virtues thereof, which are many.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] I shall but only add a word or two to what\r\nmy friend has written, _viz._, that it is a tree of the sun, and under\r\nthe celestial sign Leo, and resists witchcraft very potently, as also\r\nall the evils old Saturn can do to the body of man, and they are not\r\na few; for it is the speech of one, and I am mistaken if it were not\r\nMizaldus, that neither witch nor devil, thunder nor lightning, will\r\nhurt a man in the place where a Bay-tree is. Galen said, that the\r\nleaves or bark do dry and heal very much, and the berries more than the\r\nleaves; the bark of the root is less sharp and hot, but more bitter,\r\nand hath some astriction withal whereby it is effectual to break the\r\nstone, and good to open obstructions of the liver, spleen, and other\r\ninward parts, which bring the jaundice, dropsy, &c. The berries are\r\nvery effectual against all poison of venomous creatures, and the sting\r\nof wasps and bees; as also against the pestilence, or other infectious\r\ndiseases, and therefore put into sundry treacles for that purpose; they\r\nlikewise procure women’s courses, and seven of them given to woman in\r\nsore travail of child-birth, do cause a speedy delivery, and expel the\r\nafter-birth, and therefore not to be taken by such as have not gone out\r\ntheir time, lest they procure abortion, or cause labour too soon. They\r\nwonderfully help all cold and rheumatic distillations from the brain\r\nto the eyes, lungs or other parts; and being made into an electuary\r\nwith honey, do help the consumption, old coughs, shortness of breath,\r\nand thin rheums; as also the megrim. They mightily expel the wind, and\r\nprovoke urine; help the mother, and kill the worms. The leaves also\r\nwork the like effect. A bath of the decoction of leaves and berries, is\r\nsingularly good for women to sit in, that are troubled with the mother,\r\nor the diseases thereof, or the stoppings of their courses, or for the\r\ndiseases of the bladder, pains in the bowels by wind and stoppage of\r\nthe urine. A decoction likewise of equal parts of Bay-berries, cummin\r\nseed, hyssop, origanum, and euphorbium, with some honey, and the head\r\nbathed therewith, wonderfully helps distillations and rheums, and\r\nsettles the pallate of the mouth into its place. The oil made of the\r\nberries is very comfortable in all cold griefs of the joints, nerves,\r\narteries, stomach, belly, or womb, and helps palsies, convulsions,\r\ncramp, aches, tremblings, and numbness in any part, weariness also, and\r\npains that come by sore travelling. All griefs and pains proceeding\r\nfrom wind, either in the head, stomach, back, belly, or womb, by\r\nanointing the parts affected therewith: And pains in the ears are also\r\ncured by dropping in some of the oil, or by receiving into the ears\r\nthe fume of the decoction of the berries through a funnel. The oil\r\ntakes away the marks of the skin and flesh by bruises, falls, &c. and\r\ndissolves the congealed blood in them. It helps also the itch, scabs,\r\nand weals in the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BEANS.\r\n\r\nBOTH the garden and field beans are so well known, that it saves me the\r\nlabour of writing any description of them. The virtues follow.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] They are plants of Venus, and the distilled\r\nwater of the flower of garden beans is good to clean the face and\r\nskin from spots and wrinkles, and the meal or flour of them, or the\r\nsmall beans doth the same. The water distilled from the green husk,\r\nis held to be very effectual against the stone, and to provoke urine.\r\nBean flour is used in poultices to assuage inflammations arising from\r\nwounds, and the swelling of women’s breasts caused by the curdling of\r\ntheir milk, and represses their milk; Flour of beans and Fenugreek\r\nmixed with honey, and applied to felons, boils, bruises, or blue marks\r\nby blows, or the imposthumes in the kernels of the ears, helps them\r\nall, and with Rose leaves, Frankincense and the white of an egg, being\r\napplied to the eyes, helps them that are swollen or do water, or have\r\nreceived any blow upon them, if used with wine. If a bean be parted in\r\ntwo, the skin being taken away, and laid on the place where the leech\r\nhath been set that bleeds too much, stays the bleeding. Bean flour\r\nboiled to a poultice with wine and vinegar, and some oil put thereto,\r\neases both pains and swelling of the privities. The husk boiled in\r\nwater to the consumption of a third part thereof, stays a lask; and the\r\nashes of the husks, made up with old hog’s grease, helps the old pains,\r\ncontusions, and wounds of the sinews, the sciatica and gout. The field\r\nbeans have all the aforementioned virtues as the garden beans.\r\n\r\nBeans eaten are extremely windy meat; but if after the Dutch fashion,\r\nwhen they are half boiled you husk them and then stew them (I cannot\r\ntell you how, for I never was a cook in all my life), they are\r\nwholesome food.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FRENCH BEANS.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS French or kidney Bean arises at first but with one\r\nstalk, which afterwards divides itself into many arms or branches, but\r\nall so weak that if they be not sustained with sticks or poles, they\r\nwill be fruitless upon the ground. At several places of these branches\r\ngrow foot stalks, each with three broad round and pointed green leaves\r\nat the end of them; towards the top comes forth divers flowers made\r\nlike to pease blossoms, of the same colour for the most part that the\r\nfruit will be of, that is to say, white, yellow, red, blackish, or of\r\na deep purple, but white is the most usual; after which come long and\r\nslender flat pods, some crooked, some straight, with a string running\r\ndown the back thereof, wherein is flattish round fruit made like a\r\nkidney; the root long, spreads with many strings annexed to it, and\r\nperishes every year.\r\n\r\nThere is another sort of French beans commonly growing with us in this\r\nland, which is called the Scarlet flower Bean.\r\n\r\nThis rises with sundry branches as the other, but runs higher, to\r\nthe length of hop-poles, about which they grow twining, but turning\r\ncontrary to the sun, having foot-stalks with three leaves on each,\r\nas on the others; the flowers also are like the other, and of a most\r\norient scarlet colour. The Beans are larger than the ordinary kind, of\r\na dead purple colour turning black when ripe and dry; the root perishes\r\nin Winter.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] These also belong to Dame Venus, and being\r\ndried and beat to powder, are as great strengtheners of the kidneys as\r\nany are; neither is there a better remedy than it; a dram at a time\r\ntaken in white wine to prevent the stone, or to cleanse the kidneys\r\nof gravel or stoppage. The ordinary French Beans are of an easy\r\ndigestion; they move the belly, provoke urine, enlarge the breast that\r\nis straightened with shortness of breath, engender sperm, and incite\r\nto venery. And the scarlet coloured Beans, in regard of the glorious\r\nbeauty of their colour, being set near a quickset hedge, will much\r\nadorn the same, by climbing up thereon, so that they may be discerned a\r\ngreat way, not without admiration of the beholders at a distance. But\r\nthey will go near to kill the quicksets by cloathing them in scarlet.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LADIES BED-STRAW.\r\n\r\nBESIDES the common name above written, it is called Cheese-Rennet,\r\nbecause it performs the same office, as also Gailion, Pettimugget, and\r\nMaiden-hair; and by some Wild Rosemary.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] This rises up with divers small brown, and square upright\r\nstalks, a yard high or more; sometimes branches forth into divers\r\nparts, full of joints, and with divers very fine small leaves at\r\nevery one of them, little or nothing rough at all; at the tops of the\r\nbranches grow many long tufts or branches of yellow flowers very thick\r\nset together, from the several joints which consist of four leaves a\r\npiece, which smell somewhat strong, but not unpleasant. The seed is\r\nsmall and black like poppy seed, two for the most part joined together:\r\nThe root is reddish, with many small threads fastened to it, which take\r\nstrong hold of the ground, and creep a little: and the branches leaning\r\na little down to the ground, take root at the joints thereof, whereby\r\nit is easily increased.\r\n\r\nThere is another sort of Ladies Bedstraw growing frequently in England,\r\nwhich bears white flowers as the other doth yellow; but the branches of\r\nthis are so weak, that unless it be sustained by the hedges, or other\r\nthings near which it grows, it will lie down to the ground; the leaves\r\na little bigger than the former, and the flowers not so plentiful as\r\nthese; and the root hereof is also thready and abiding.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow in meadow and pastures both wet and dry, and by the\r\nhedges.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in May for the most part, and the seed is ripe in\r\nJuly and August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] They are both herbs of Venus, and therefore\r\nstrengthening the parts both internal and external, which she rules.\r\nThe decoction of the former of those being drank, is good to fret and\r\nbreak the stone, provoke the urine, stays inward bleeding, and heals\r\ninward wounds. The herb or flower bruised and put into the nostrils,\r\nstays their bleeding likewise; The flowers and herbs being made into\r\nan oil, by being set in the sun, and changed after it has stood ten or\r\ntwelve days; or into an ointment being boiled in _Axunga_, or sallad\r\noil, with some wax melted therein, after it is strained; either the\r\noil made thereof, or the ointment, do help burnings with fire, or\r\nscalding with water. The same also, or the decoction of the herb and\r\nflower, is good to bathe the feet of travellers and lacquies, whose\r\nlong running causes weariness and stiffness in the sinews and joints.\r\nIf the decoction be used warm, and the joints afterwards anointed with\r\nointment, it helps the dry scab, and the itch in children; and the herb\r\nwith the white flower is also very good for the sinews, arteries, and\r\njoints, to comfort and strengthen them after travel, cold, and pains.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BEETS.\r\n\r\nOF Beets there are two sorts, which are best known generally, and\r\nwhereof I shall principally treat at this time, _viz._ the white and\r\nred Beets and their virtues.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The common white beet has many great leaves next the\r\nground, somewhat large and of a whitish green colour. The stalk is\r\ngreat, strong, and ribbed, bearing great store of leaves upon it,\r\nalmost to the very top of it: The flowers grow in very long tufts,\r\nsmall at the end, and turning down their heads, which are small, pale\r\ngreenish, yellow, buds, giving cornered prickly seed. The root is\r\ngreat, long, and hard, and when it has given seed is of no use at all.\r\n\r\nThe common red Beet differs not from the white, but only it is\r\nless, and the leaves and the roots are somewhat red; the leaves are\r\ndifferently red, some only with red stalks or veins; some of a fresh\r\nred, and others of a dark red. The root thereof is red, spungy, and not\r\nused to be eaten.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The government of these two sorts of Beets\r\nare far different; the red Beet being under Saturn and the white under\r\nJupiter; therefore take the virtues of them apart, each by itself. The\r\nwhite Beet much loosens the belly, and is of a cleansing, digesting\r\nquality, and provokes urine. The juice of it opens obstructions both\r\nof the liver and spleen, and is good for the head-ache and swimmings\r\ntherein, and turnings of the brain; and is effectual also against all\r\nvenomous creatures; and applied to the temples, stays inflammations of\r\nthe eyes; it helps burnings, being used with oil, and with a little\r\nalum put to it, is good for St. Anthony’s fire. It is good for all\r\nwheals, pushes, blisters, and blains in the skin: the herb boiled,\r\nand laid upon chilblains or kibes, helps them. The decoction thereof\r\nin water and some vinegar, heals the itch, if bathed therewith; and\r\ncleanses the head of dandruff, scurf, and dry scabs, and does much good\r\nfor fretting and running sores, ulcers, and cankers in the head, legs,\r\nor other parts, and is much commended against baldness and shedding the\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nThe red Beet is good to stay the bloody-flux, women’s courses, and the\r\nwhites, and to help the yellow jaundice; the juice of the root put into\r\nthe nostrils, purges the head, helps the noise in the ears, and the\r\ntooth-ache; the juice snuffed up the nose, helps a stinking breath, if\r\nthe cause lie in the nose, as many times it does, if any bruise has\r\nbeen there: as also want of smell coming that way.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WATER BETONY.\r\n\r\nCALLED also Brown-wort, and in Yorkshire, Bishop’s-leaves.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] First, of the Water Betony, which rises up with square,\r\nhard, greenish stalks, sometimes brown, set with broad dark green\r\nleaves dented about the edges with notches somewhat resembling the\r\nleaves of the Wood Betony, but much larger too, for the most part set\r\nat a joint. The flowers are many, set at the tops of the stalks and\r\nbranches, being round bellied and open at the brims, and divided into\r\ntwo parts, the uppermost being like a hood, and the lowermost like a\r\nhip hanging down, of a dark red colour, which passing, there comes in\r\ntheir places small round heads with small points at the ends, wherein\r\nlie small and brownish seeds; the root is a thick bush of strings and\r\nshreds, growing from the head.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows by the ditch side, brooks and other water-courses,\r\ngenerally through this land, and is seldom found far from the\r\nwater-side.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers about July, and the seed is ripe in August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Water Betony is an herb of Jupiter in\r\nCancer, and is appropriated more to wounds and hurts in the breast\r\nthan Wood Betony, which follows: It is an excellent remedy for sick\r\nhogs. It is of a cleansing quality. The leaves bruised and applied are\r\neffectual for all old and filthy ulcers; and especially if the juice of\r\nthe leaves be boiled with a little honey, and dipped therein, and the\r\nsores dressed therewith; as also for bruises and hurts, whether inward\r\nor outward. The distilled water of the leaves is used for the same\r\npurpose; as also to bathe the face and hands spotted or blemished, or\r\ndiscoloured by sun burning.\r\n\r\nI confess I do not much fancy distilled waters, I mean such waters as\r\nare distilled cold; some virtues of the herb they may haply have (it\r\nwere a strange thing else;) but this I am confident of, that being\r\ndistilled in a pewter still, as the vulgar and apish fashion is, both\r\nchemical oil and salt is left behind unless you burn them, and then all\r\nis spoiled, water and all, which was good for as little as can be, by\r\nsuch a distillation.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WOOD BETONY.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] COMMON or Wood Betony has many leaves rising from the\r\nroot, which are somewhat broad and round at the end, roundly dented\r\nabout the edges, standing upon long foot stalks, from among which rise\r\nup small, square, slender, but upright hairy stalks, with some leaves\r\nthereon to a piece at the joints, smaller than the lower, whereon\r\nare set several spiked heads of flowers like Lavender, but thicker\r\nand shorter for the most part, and of a reddish or purple colour,\r\nspotted with white spots both in the upper and lower part. The seeds\r\nbeing contained within the husks that hold the flowers, are blackish,\r\nsomewhat long and uneven. The roots are many white thready strings: the\r\nstalks perish, but the roots with some leaves thereon, abide all the\r\nWinter. The whole plant is somewhat small.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows frequently in woods, and delights in shady places.\r\n\r\n_Time._] And it flowers in July; after which the seed is quickly ripe,\r\nyet in its prime in May.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The herb is appropriated to the planet\r\nJupiter, and the sign Aries. Antonius Musa, physician to the Emperor\r\nAugustus Cæsar, wrote a peculiar book of the virtues of this herb; and\r\namong other virtues saith of it, that it preserves the liver and bodies\r\nof men from the danger of epidemical diseases, and from witchcraft\r\nalso; it helps those that loath and cannot digest their meat, those\r\nthat have weak stomachs and sour belchings, or continual rising in\r\ntheir stomachs, using it familiarly either green or dry; either the\r\nherb, or root, or the flowers, in broth, drink, or meat, or made into\r\nconserve, syrup, water, electuary, or powder, as every one may best\r\nframe themselves unto, or as the time and season requires; taken any\r\nof the aforesaid ways, it helps the jaundice, falling sickness, the\r\npalsy, convulsions, or shrinking of the sinews, the gout and those\r\nthat are inclined to dropsy, those that have continual pains in their\r\nheads, although it turn to phrensy. The powder mixed with pure honey\r\nis no less available for all sorts of coughs or colds, wheesing, or\r\nshortness of breath, distillations of thin rheum upon the lungs,\r\nwhich causes consumptions. The decoction made with Mead, and a little\r\nPennyroyal, is good for those that are troubled with putrid agues,\r\nwhether quotidian, tertian, or quartan, and to draw down and evacuate\r\nthe blood and humours, that by falling into the eyes, do hinder the\r\nsight; the decoction thereof made in wine and taken, kills the worms\r\nin the belly, opens obstructions both of the spleen and liver; cures\r\nstitches, and pains in the back and sides, the torments and griping\r\npains in the bowels, and the wind cholic; and mixed with honey purges\r\nthe belly, helps to bring down women’s courses, and is of special use\r\nfor those that are troubled with the falling down of the mother, and\r\npains thereof, and causes an easy and speedy delivery of women in\r\nchild-birth. It helps also to break and expel the stone, either in\r\nthe bladder or kidneys. The decoction with wine gargled in the mouth,\r\neases the tooth-ache. It is commended against the stinging and biting\r\nof venomous serpents, or mad dogs, being used inwardly and applied\r\noutwardly to the place. A dram of the powder of Betony taken with a\r\nlittle honey in some vinegar, does wonderfully refresh those that are\r\nover wearied by travelling. It stays bleeding at the mouth or nose,\r\nand helps those that void or spit blood, and those that are bursten\r\nor have a rupture, and is good for such as are bruised by any fall or\r\notherwise. The green herb bruised, or the juice applied to any inward\r\nhurt, or outward green wound in the head or body, will quickly heal\r\nand close it up; as also any vein or sinews that are cut, and will\r\ndraw forth any broken bone or splinter, thorn or other things got into\r\nthe flesh. It is no less profitable for old sores or filthy ulcers,\r\nyea, tho’ they be fistulous and hollow. But some do advise to put a\r\nlittle salt for this purpose, being applied with a little hog’s lard,\r\nit helps a plague sore, and other boils and pushes. The fumes of the\r\ndecoction while it is warm, received by a funnel into the ears, eases\r\nthe pains of them, destroys the worms and cures the running sores in\r\nthem. The juice dropped into them does the same. The root of Betony\r\nis displeasing both to the taste and stomach, whereas the leaves and\r\nflowers, by their sweet and spicy taste, are comfortable both to meat\r\nand medicine.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the many virtues Anthony Muse, an expert physician\r\n(for it was not the practice of Octavius Cæsar to keep fools about\r\nhim), appropriates to Betony; it is a very precious herb, that is\r\ncertain, and most fitting to be kept in a man’s house, both in syrup,\r\nconserve, oil, ointment and plaister. The flowers are usually conserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE BEECH TREE.\r\n\r\nIN treating of this tree, you must understand, that I mean the green\r\nmast Beech, which is by way of distinction from that other small rough\r\nsort, called in Sussex the smaller Beech, but in Essex Horn-beam.\r\n\r\nI suppose it is needless to describe it, being already too well known\r\nto my countrymen.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in woods amongst oaks and other trees, and in parks,\r\nforests, and chases, to feed deer; and in other places to fatten swine.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It blooms in the end of April, or beginning of May, for the\r\nmost part, and the fruit is ripe in September.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a plant of Saturn, and therefore\r\nperforms his qualities and proportion in these operations. The leaves\r\nof the Beech tree are cooling and binding, and therefore good to be\r\napplied to hot swellings to discuss them; the nuts do much nourish such\r\nbeasts as feed thereon. The water that is found in the hollow places\r\nof decaying Beeches will cure both man and beast of any scurf, or\r\nrunning tetters, if they be washed therewith; you may boil the leaves\r\ninto a poultice, or make an ointment of them when time of year serves.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BILBERRIES, CALLED BY SOME WHORTS,\r\n    AND WHORTLE-BERRIES.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] OF these I shall only speak of two sorts which are common\r\nin England, viz. The black and red berries. And first of the black.\r\n\r\nThe small bush creeps along upon the ground, scarcely rising half a\r\nyard high, with divers small green leaves set in the green branches,\r\nnot always one against the other, and a little dented about the edges:\r\nAt the foot of the leaves come forth small, hollow, pale, bluish\r\ncoloured flowers, the brims ending at five points, with a reddish\r\nthread in the middle, which pass into small round berries of the\r\nbigness and colour of juniper berries, but of a purple, sweetish sharp\r\ntaste; the juice of them gives a purplish colour in their hands and\r\nlips that eat and handle them, especially if they break them. The\r\nroot grows aslope under ground, shooting forth in sundry places as it\r\ncreeps. This loses its leaves in Winter.\r\n\r\nThe Red Bilberry, or Whortle-Bush, rises up like the former, having\r\nsundry hard leaves, like the Box-tree leaves, green and round pointed,\r\nstanding on the several branches, at the top whereof only, and not from\r\nthe sides, as in the former, come forth divers round, reddish, sappy\r\nberries, when they are ripe, of a sharp taste. The root runs in the\r\nground, as in the former, but the leaves of this abide all Winter.\r\n\r\n_Place._] The first grows in forests, on the heaths, and such like\r\nbarren places: the red grows in the north parts of this land, as\r\nLancashire, Yorkshire, &c.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in March and April, and the fruit of the black is\r\nripe in July and August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] They are under the dominion of Jupiter. It\r\nis a pity they are used no more in physic than they are.\r\n\r\nThe black Bilberries are good in hot agues and to cool the heat of the\r\nliver and stomach; they do somewhat bind the belly, and stay vomiting\r\nand loathings; the juice of the berries made in a syrup, or the pulp\r\nmade into a conserve with sugar, is good for the purposes aforesaid,\r\nas also for an old cough, or an ulcer in the lungs, or other diseases\r\ntherein. The Red Worts are more binding, and stops women’s courses,\r\nspitting of blood, or any other flux of blood or humours, being used as\r\nwell outwardly as inwardly.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BIFOIL OR TWABLADE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS small herb, from a root somewhat sweet, shooting\r\ndownwards many long strings, rises up a round green stalk, bare or\r\nnaked next the ground for an inch, two or three to the middle thereof\r\nas it is in age or growth; as also from the middle upwards to the\r\nflowers, having only two broad Plaintain-like leaves (but whiter) set\r\nat the middle of the stalk one against another, compassing it round at\r\nthe bottom of them.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It is an usual inhabitant in woods, copses, and in many\r\nplaces in this land.\r\n\r\nThere is another sort grows in wet grounds and marshes, which is\r\nsomewhat different from the former. It is a smaller plant, and greener,\r\nhaving sometimes three leaves; the spike of the flowers is less than\r\nthe former, and the roots of this do run or creep in the ground.\r\n\r\nThey are often used by many to good purpose for wounds, both green and\r\nold, to consolidate or knit ruptures; and well it may, being a plant of\r\nSaturn.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE BIRCH TREE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS grows a goodly tall straight tree, fraught with many\r\nboughs, and slender branches bending downward: the old being covered\r\nwith discoloured chapped bark, and the younger being browner by much.\r\nThe leaves at the first breaking out are crumpled, and afterwards\r\nlike the beech leaves, but smaller and greener, and dented about the\r\nedges. It bears small short cat-skins, somewhat like those of the\r\nhazelnut-tree, which abide on the branches a long time, until growing\r\nripe, they fall on the ground and their seed with them.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It usually grows in woods.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a tree of Venus; the juice of the\r\nleaves, while they are young, or the distilled water of them, or the\r\nwater that comes from the tree being bored with an auger, and distilled\r\nafterwards; any of these being drank for some days together, is\r\navailable to break the stone in the kidneys and bladder, and is good\r\nalso to wash sore mouths.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BIRD’S FOOT.\r\n\r\nTHIS small herb grows not above a span high with many branches spread\r\nupon the ground, set with many wings of small leaves. The flowers grow\r\nupon the branches, many small ones of a pale yellow colour being set\r\na-head together, which afterwards turn into small jointed pods, well\r\nresembling the claw of small birds, whence it took its name.\r\n\r\nThere is another sort of Bird’s Foot in all things like the former,\r\nbut a little larger; the flowers of a pale whitish and red colour, and\r\nthe pods distinct by joints like the other, but little more crooked;\r\nand the roots do carry many small white knots or kernels amongst the\r\nstrings.\r\n\r\n_Place._] These grow on heaths, and many open untilled places of this\r\nland.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower and seed in the end of Summer.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] They belong to Saturn and are of a drying,\r\nbinding quality, and thereby very good to be used in wound drinks, as\r\nalso to apply outwardly for the same purpose. But the latter Bird’s\r\nFoot is found by experience to break the stone in the back or kidneys,\r\nand drives them forth, if the decoction thereof be taken; and it\r\nwonderfully helps the ruptures, being taken inwardly, and outwardly\r\napplied to the place.\r\n\r\nAll sorts have best operations upon the stone, as ointments and\r\nplaisters have upon wounds: and therefore you may make a salt of this\r\nfor the stone; the way how to do so may be found in my translation\r\nof the London Dispensatory; and it may be I may give you it again in\r\nplainer terms at the latter end of this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BISHOP’S-WEED.\r\n\r\nBESIDES the common name Bishop’s-weed, it is usually known by the Greek\r\nname _Ammi_ and _Ammois_; some call it Æthiopian Cummin-seed, and\r\nothers Cummin-royal, as also Herb William, and Bull-wort.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] Common Bishop’s-weed rises up with a round straight stalk,\r\nsometimes as high as a man, but usually three or four feet high, beset\r\nwith divers small, long and somewhat broad leaves, cut in some places,\r\nand dented about the edges, growing one against another, of a dark\r\ngreen colour, having sundry branches on them, and at the top small\r\numbels of white flowers, which turn into small round seeds little\r\nbigger than Parsley seeds, of a quick hot scent and taste; the root is\r\nwhite and stringy; perishing yearly, and usually rises again on its own\r\nsowing.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows wild in many places in England and Wales, as between\r\nGreenhithe and Gravesend.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is hot and dry in the third degree, of a\r\nbitter taste, and somewhat sharp withal; it provokes lust to purpose; I\r\nsuppose Venus owns it. It digests humours, provokes urine and women’s\r\ncourses, dissolves wind, and being taken in wine it eases pains and\r\ngriping in the bowels, and is good against the biting of serpents; it\r\nis used to good effect in those medicines which are given to hinder\r\nthe poisonous operation of Cantharides, upon the passage of the urine:\r\nbeing mixed with honey and applied to black and blue marks, coming of\r\nblows or bruises, it takes them away; and being drank or outwardly\r\napplied, it abates a high colour, and makes it pale; and the fumes\r\nthereof taken with rosin or raisins, cleanses the mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BISTORT, OR SNAKEWEED.\r\n\r\nIT is called Snakeweed, English Serpentary, Dragon-wort, Osterick, and\r\nPassions.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] This has a thick short knobbed root, blackish without, and\r\nsomewhat reddish within, a little crooked or turned together, of a hard\r\nastringent taste, with divers black threads hanging therefrom, whence\r\nsprings up every year divers leaves, standing upon long footstalks,\r\nbeing somewhat broad and long like a dock leaf, and a little pointed\r\nat the ends, but that it is of a blueish green colour on the upper\r\nside, and of an ash-colour grey, and a little purplish underneath, with\r\ndivers veins therein, from among which rise up divers small and slender\r\nstalks, two feet high, and almost naked and without leaves, or with a\r\nvery few, and narrow, bearing a spiky bush of pale-coloured flowers;\r\nwhich being past, there abides small seed, like unto Sorrel seed, but\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\nThere are other sorts of Bistort growing in this land, but smaller,\r\nboth in height, root, and stalks, and especially in the leaves. The\r\nroot blackish without, and somewhat whitish within; of an austere\r\nbinding taste, as the former.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow in shadowy moist woods, and at the foot of hills,\r\nbut are chiefly nourished up in gardens. The narrow leafed Bistort\r\ngrows in the north, in Lancashire, Yorkshire, and Cumberland.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower about the end of May, and the seed is ripe about\r\nthe beginning of July.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It belongs to Saturn, and is in operation\r\ncold and dry; both the leaves and roots have a powerful faculty to\r\nresist all poison. The root, in powder, taken in drink expels the venom\r\nof the plague, the small-pox, measels, purples, or any other infectious\r\ndisease, driving it out by sweating. The root in powder, the decoction\r\nthereof in wine being drank, stays all manner of inward bleeding, or\r\nspitting of blood, and any fluxes in the body of either man or woman,\r\nor vomiting. It is also very available against ruptures, or burstings,\r\nor all bruises from falls, dissolving the congealed blood, and easing\r\nthe pains that happen thereupon; it also helps the jaundice.\r\n\r\nThe water, distilled from both leaves and roots, is a singular remedy\r\nto wash any place bitten or stung by any venomous creature; as also\r\nfor any of the purposes before spoken of, and is very good to wash any\r\nrunning sores or ulcers. The decoction of the root in wine being drank,\r\nhinders abortion or miscarriage in child-bearing. The leaves also\r\nkill the worms in children, and is a great help to them that cannot\r\nkeep their water; if the juice of Plaintain be added thereto, and\r\noutwardly applied, much helps the ghonorrhea, or running of the reins.\r\nA dram of the powder of the root, taken in water thereof, wherein some\r\nred hot iron or steel hath been quenched, is also an admirable help\r\nthereto, so as the body be first prepared and purged from the offensive\r\nhumours. The leaves, seed, or roots, are all very good in decoction,\r\ndrinks, or lotions, for inward or outward wounds, or other sores.\r\nAnd the powder, strewed upon any cut or wound in a vein, stays the\r\nimmoderate bleeding thereof. The decoction of the root in water, where\r\nunto some pomegranate peels and flowers are added, injected into the\r\nmatrix, stays the immoderate flux of the courses. The root thereof,\r\nwith pelitory of Spain and burnt alum, of each a little quantity,\r\nbeaten small and into paste with some honey, and a little piece thereof\r\nput into a hollow tooth, or held between the teeth, if there be no\r\nhollowness in them, stays the defluction of rheum upon them which\r\ncauses pains, and helps to cleanse the head, and void much offensive\r\nwater. The distilled water is very effectual to wash sores or cankers\r\nin the nose, or any other part; if the powder of the root be applied\r\nthereunto afterwards. It is good also to fasten the gums, and to take\r\naway the heat and inflammations that happen in the jaws, almonds of\r\nthe throat, or mouth, if the decoction of the leaves, roots, or seeds\r\nbruised, or the juice of them, be applied; but the roots are most\r\neffectual to the purposes aforesaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ONE-BLADE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS small plant never bears more than one leaf, but only\r\nwhen it rises up with its stalk, which thereon bears another, and\r\nseldom more, which are of a blueish green colour, broad at the bottom,\r\nand pointed with many ribs or veins like Plaintain; at the top of the\r\nstalk grows many small flowers star-fashion, smelling somewhat sweet;\r\nafter which comes small reddish berries when they are ripe. The root\r\nsmall, of the bigness of a rush, lying and creeping under the upper\r\ncrust of the earth, shooting forth in divers places.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in moist, shadowy, grassy places of woods, in many\r\nplaces of this realm.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers about May, and the berries are ripe in June, and\r\nthen quickly perishes, until the next year it springs from the same\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a herb of the Sun, and therefore\r\ncordial; half a dram, or a dram at most, of the root hereof in powder\r\ntaken in wine and vinegar, of each a little quantity, and the party\r\npresently laid to sweat, is held to be a sovereign remedy for those\r\nthat are infected with the plague, and have a sore upon them, by\r\nexpelling the poison, and defending the heart and spirit from danger.\r\nIt is also accounted a singular good wound herb, and therefore used\r\nwith other herbs in making such balms as are necessary for curing of\r\nwounds, either green or old, and especially if the nerves be hurt.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE BRAMBLE, OR BLACK-BERRY BUSH.\r\n\r\nIT is so well known that it needs no description. The virtues thereof\r\nare as follows:—\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a plant of Venus in Aries. If any\r\nask the reason why Venus is so prickly? Tell them it is because she\r\nis in the house of Mars. The buds, leaves, and branches, while they\r\nare green, are of a good use in the ulcers and putrid sores of the\r\nmouth and throat, and of the quinsey, and likewise to heal other fresh\r\nwounds and sores; but the flowers and fruit unripe are very binding,\r\nand so profitable for the bloody flux, lasks, and are a fit remedy for\r\nspitting of blood. Either the decoction of the powder or of the root\r\ntaken, is good to break or drive forth gravel and the stone in the\r\nreins and kidneys. The leaves and brambles, as well green as dry, are\r\nexceeding good lotions for sores in the mouth, or secret parts. The\r\ndecoction of them, and of the dried branches, do much bind the belly\r\nand are good for too much flowing of women’s courses; the berries\r\nof the flowers are a powerful remedy against the poison of the most\r\nvenomous serpents; as well drank as outwardly applied, helps the\r\nsores of the fundament and the piles; the juice of the berries mixed\r\nwith the juice of mulberries, do bind more effectually, and helps\r\nall fretting and eating sores and ulcers wheresoever. The distilled\r\nwater of the branches, leaves, and flowers, or of the fruit, is very\r\npleasant in taste, and very effectual in fevers and hot distempers of\r\nthe body, head, eyes, and other parts, and for the purposes aforesaid.\r\nThe leaves boiled in lye, and the head washed therewith, heals the\r\nitch and running sores thereof, and makes the hair black. The powder\r\nof the leaves strewed on cankers and running ulcers, wonderfully helps\r\nto heal them. Some use to condensate the juice of the leaves, and some\r\nthe juice of the berries, to keep for their use all the year, for the\r\npurposes aforesaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BLITES.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] OF these there are two sorts commonly known, viz. white\r\nand red. The white has leaves somewhat like to Beets, but smaller,\r\nrounder and of a whitish green colour, every one standing upon a small\r\nlong footstalk: the stalk rises up two or three feet high, with such\r\nlike leaves thereon; the flowers grow at the top in long round tufts,\r\nor clusters, wherein are contained small and round seeds; the root is\r\nvery full of threads or strings.\r\n\r\nThe red Blite is in all things like the white but that its leaves and\r\ntufted heads are exceeding red at first, and after turn more purple.\r\n\r\nThere are other kinds of Blites which grow different from the two\r\nformer sorts but little, but only the wild are smaller in every part.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow in gardens, and wild in many places in this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They seed in August and September.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] They are all of them cooling, drying, and\r\nbinding, serving to restrain the fluxes of blood in either man or\r\nwoman, especially the red; which also stays the overflowing of the\r\nwomen’s reds, as the white Blites stays the whites in women. It is an\r\nexcellent secret; you cannot well fail in the use. They are all under\r\nthe dominion of Venus.\r\n\r\nThere is another sort of wild Blites like the other wild kinds, but\r\nhave long and spiky heads of greenish seeds, seeming by the thick\r\nsetting together to be all seed.\r\n\r\nThis sort the fishers are delighted with, and it is good and usual\r\nbait; for fishes will bite fast enough at them, if you have wit enough\r\nto catch them when they bite.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BORAGE AND BUGLOSS.\r\n\r\nTHESE are so well known to the inhabitants in every garden that I hold\r\nit needless to describe them.\r\n\r\nTo these I may add a third sort, which is not so common, nor yet so\r\nwell known, and therefore I shall give you its name and description.\r\n\r\nIt is called _Langue de Bœuf_; but why then should they call one herb\r\nby the name of Bugloss, and another by the name _Langue de Bœuf_? it is\r\nsome question to me, seeing one signifies Ox-tongue in Greek, and the\r\nother signifies the same in French.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The leaves whereof are smaller than those of Bugloss but\r\nmuch rougher; the stalks rising up about a foot and a half high, and is\r\nmost commonly of a red colour; the flowers stand in scaly round heads,\r\nbeing composed of many small yellow flowers not much unlike to those\r\nof Dandelion, and the seed flieth away in down as that doth; you may\r\neasily know the flowers by their taste, for they are very bitter.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows wild in many places of this land, and may be\r\nplentifully found near London, as between Rotherhithe and Deptford, by\r\nthe ditch side. Its virtues are held to be the same with Borage and\r\nBugloss, only this is somewhat hotter.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in June and July, and the seed is ripe shortly\r\nafter.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] They are all three herbs of Jupiter and\r\nunder Leo, all great cordials, and great strengtheners of nature.\r\nThe leaves and roots are to very good purpose used in putrid and\r\npestilential fevers, to defend the heart, and help to resist and expel\r\nthe poison, or the venom of other creatures: the seed is of the like\r\neffect; and the seed and leaves are good to increase milk in women’s\r\nbreasts; the leaves, flowers, and seed, all or any of them, are good to\r\nexpel pensiveness and melancholy; it helps to clarify the blood, and\r\nmitigate heat in fevers. The juice made into a syrup prevails much to\r\nall the purposes aforesaid, and is put, with other cooling, opening and\r\ncleansing herbs to open obstructions, and help the yellow jaundice, and\r\nmixed with Fumitory, to cool, cleanse, and temper the blood thereby;\r\nit helps the itch, ringworms and tetters, or other spreading scabs or\r\nsores. The flowers candied or made into a conserve, are helpful in the\r\nformer cases, but are chiefly used as a cordial, and are good for those\r\nthat are weak in long sickness, and to comfort the heart and spirits\r\nof those that are in a consumption, or troubled with often swoonings,\r\nor passions of the heart. The distilled water is no less effectual to\r\nall the purposes aforesaid, and helps the redness and inflammations of\r\nthe eyes, being washed therewith; the herb dried is never used, but\r\nthe green; yet the ashes thereof boiled in mead, or honied water, is\r\navailable against the inflammations and ulcers in the mouth or throat,\r\nto gargle it therewith; the roots of Bugloss are effectual, being made\r\ninto a licking electuary for the cough, and to condensate thick phlegm,\r\nand the rheumatic distillations upon the lungs.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BLUE-BOTTLE.\r\n\r\nIT is called Syanus, I suppose from the colour of it; Hurt-sickle,\r\nbecause it turns the edge of the sickles that reap the corn; Blue-blow,\r\nCorn-flower, and Blue-bottle.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] I shall only describe that which is commonest, and in\r\nmy opinion most useful; its leaves spread upon the ground, being\r\nof a whitish green colour, somewhat on the edges like those of\r\nCorn-Scabious, amongst which rises up a stalk divided into divers\r\nbranches, beset with long leaves of a greenish colour, either but very\r\nlittle indented, or not at all; the flowers are of a blueish colour,\r\nfrom whence it took its name, consisting of an innumerable company of\r\nflowers set in a scaly head, not much unlike those of Knap-weed; the\r\nseed is smooth, bright, and shining, wrapped up in a woolly mantle; the\r\nroot perishes every year.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow in cornfields, amongst all sorts of corn (pease,\r\nbeans, and tares excepted.) If you please to take them up from thence,\r\nand transplant them in your garden, especially towards the full of the\r\nmoon, they will grow more double than they are, and many times change\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower from the beginning of May, to the end of the\r\nharvest.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] As they are naturally cold, dry, and\r\nbinding, so they are under the dominion of Saturn. The powder or\r\ndried leaves of the Blue-bottle, or Corn-flower, is given with good\r\nsuccess to those that are bruised by a fall, or have broken a vein\r\ninwardly, and void much blood at the mouth; being taken in the water of\r\nPlaintain, Horsetail, or the greater Confrey, it is a remedy against\r\nthe poison of the Scorpion, and resists all venoms and poison. The\r\nseed or leaves taken in wine, is very good against the plague, and\r\nall infectious diseases, and is very good in pestilential fevers. The\r\njuice put into fresh or green wounds, doth quickly solder up the lips\r\nof them together, and is very effectual to heal all ulcers and sores\r\nin the mouth. The juice dropped into the eyes takes away the heat and\r\ninflammation of them. The distilled water of this herb, has the same\r\nproperties, and may be used for the effects aforesaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BRANK URSINE.\r\n\r\nBESIDES the common name Brank-Ursine, it is also called Bear’s-breach,\r\nand Acanthus, though I think our English names to be more proper; for\r\nthe Greek word _Acanthus_, signifies any thistle whatsoever.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] This thistle shoots forth very many large, thick, sad\r\ngreen smooth leaves on the ground, with a very thick and juicy middle\r\nrib; the leaves are parted with sundry deep gashes on the edges; the\r\nleaves remain a long time, before any stalk appears, afterwards rising\r\nup a reasonable big stalk, three or four feet high, and bravely decked\r\nwith flowers from the middle of the stalk upwards; for on the lower\r\npart of the stalk, there is neither branches nor leaf. The flowers are\r\nhooded and gaping, being white in colour, and standing in brownish\r\nhusk, with a long small undivided leaf under each leaf; they seldom\r\nseed in our country. Its roots are many, great and thick, blackish\r\nwithout and whitish within, full of a clammy sap; a piece of them if\r\nyou set it in the garden, and defend it from the first Winter cold will\r\ngrow and flourish.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They are only nursed in the gardens in England, where they\r\nwill grow very well.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in June and July.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an excellent plant under the dominion\r\nof the Moon; I could wish such as are studious would labour to keep\r\nit in their gardens. The leaves being boiled and used in clysters, is\r\nexcellent good to mollify the belly, and make the passage slippery. The\r\ndecoction drank inwardly, is excellent and good for the bloody-flux;\r\nThe leaves being bruised, or rather boiled and applied like a poultice\r\nare excellent good to unite broken bones and strengthen joints that\r\nhave been put out. The decoction of either leaves or roots being drank,\r\nand the decoction of leaves applied to the place, is excellent good\r\nfor the king’s evil that is broken and runs; for by the influence of\r\nthe moon, it revives the ends of the veins which are relaxed. There is\r\nscarce a better remedy to be applied to such places as are burnt with\r\nfire than this is, for it fetches out the fire, and heals it without a\r\nscar. This is an excellent remedy for such as are bursten, being either\r\ntaken inwardly, or applied to the place. In like manner used, it helps\r\nthe cramp and the gout. It is excellently good in hectic fevers, and\r\nrestores radical moisture to such as are in consumptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BRIONY, OR WILD VINE.\r\n\r\nIT is called Wild, and Wood Vine, Tamus, or Ladies’ Seal. The white is\r\ncalled White Vine by some; and the black, Black Vine.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The common White Briony grows ramping upon the hedges,\r\nsending forth many long, rough, very tender branches at the beginning,\r\nwith many very rough, and broad leaves thereon, cut (for the most part)\r\ninto five partitions, in form very like a vine leaf, but smaller,\r\nrough, and of a whitish hoary green colour, spreading very far,\r\nspreading and twining with his small claspers (that come forth at the\r\njoints with the leaves) very far on whatsoever stands next to it. At\r\nthe several joints also (especially towards the top of the branches)\r\ncomes forth a long stalk bearing many whitish flowers together on a\r\nlong tuft, consisting of five small leaves a-piece, laid open like a\r\nstar, after which come the berries separated one from another, more\r\nthan a cluster of grapes, green at the first, and very red when they\r\nare thorough ripe, of no good scent, but of a most loathsome taste\r\nprovokes vomit. The root grows to be exceeding great, with many long\r\ntwines or branches going from it, of a pale whitish colour on the\r\noutside, and more white within, and of a sharp, bitter, loathsome taste.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows on banks, or under hedges, through this land; the\r\nroots lie very deep.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in July and August, some earlier, and some later\r\nthan the other.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] They are furious martial plants. The root\r\nof Briony purges the belly with great violence, troubling the stomach\r\nand burning the liver, and therefore not rashly to be taken; but being\r\ncorrected, is very profitable for the diseases of the head, as falling\r\nsickness, giddiness, and swimmings, by drawing away much phlegm and\r\nrheumatic humours that oppress the head, as also the joints and sinews;\r\nand is therefore good for palsies, convulsions, cramps, and stitches\r\nin the sides, and the dropsy, and for provoking urine; it cleanses the\r\nreins and kidneys from gravel and stone, by opening the obstructions\r\nof the spleen, and consume the hardness and swelling thereof. The\r\ndecoction of the root in wine, drank once a week at going to bed,\r\ncleanses the mother, and helps the rising thereof, expels the dead\r\nchild; a dram of the root in powder taken in white wine, brings down\r\ntheir courses. An electuary made of the roots and honey, doth mightily\r\ncleanse the chest of rotten phlegm, and wonderfully help any old strong\r\ncough, to those that are troubled with shortness of breath, and is good\r\nfor them that are bruised inwardly, to help to expel the clotted or\r\ncongealed blood. The leaves, fruit, and root do cleanse old and filthy\r\nsores, are good against all fretting and running cankers, gangrenes,\r\nand tetters and therefore the berries are by some country people called\r\ntetter-berries. The root cleanses the skin wonderfully from all black\r\nand blue spots, freckles, morphew, leprosy, foul scars, or other\r\ndeformity whatsoever; also all running scabs and manginess are healed\r\nby the powder of the dried root, or the juice thereof, but especially\r\nby the fine white hardened juice. The distilled water of the root\r\nworks the same effects, but more weakly; the root bruised and applied\r\nof itself to any place where the bones are broken, helps to draw them\r\nforth, as also splinters and thorns in the flesh; and being applied\r\nwith a little wine mixed therewith, it breaks boils, and helps whitlows\r\non the joints.—For all these latter, beginning at sores, cancers, &c.\r\napply it outwardly, mixing it with a little hog’s grease, or other\r\nconvenient ointment.\r\n\r\nAs for the former diseases where it must be taken inwardly, it purges\r\nvery violently, and needs an abler hand to correct it than most country\r\npeople have.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BROOK LIME, OR WATER-PIMPERNEL.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS sends forth from a creeping root that shoots forth\r\nstrings at every joint, as it runs, divers and sundry green stalks,\r\nround and sappy with some branches on them, somewhat broad, round, deep\r\ngreen, and thick leaves set by couples thereon; from the bottom whereof\r\nshoot forth long foot stalks, with sundry small blue flowers on them,\r\nthat consist of five small round pointed leaves a piece.\r\n\r\nThere is another sort nothing different from the former, but that it is\r\ngreater, and the flowers of a paler green colour.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow in small standing waters, and usually near\r\nWater-Cresses.\r\n\r\n_Time._] And flower in June and July, giving seed the next month after.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a hot and biting martial plant.\r\nBrook-lime and Water-Cresses are generally used together in diet-drink,\r\nwith other things serving to purge the blood and body from all ill\r\nhumours that would destroy health, and are helpful to the scurvy. They\r\ndo all provoke urine, and help to break the stone, and pass it away;\r\nthey procure women’s courses, and expel the dead child. Being fried\r\nwith butter and vinegar, and applied warm, it helps all manner of\r\ntumours, swellings, and inflammations.\r\n\r\nSuch drinks ought to be made of sundry herbs, according to the malady.\r\nI shall give a plain and easy rule at the latter end of this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BUTCHER’S BROOM.\r\n\r\nIT is called Ruscus, and Bruscus, Kneeholm, Kneeholly, Kneehulver, and\r\nPettigree.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The first shoots that sprout from the root of Butcher’s\r\nBroom, are thick, whitish, and short, somewhat like those of Asparagus,\r\nbut greater, they rise up to be a foot and half high, are spread into\r\ndivers branches, green, and somewhat creased with the roundness, tough\r\nand flexible, whereon are set somewhat broad and almost round hard\r\nleaves and prickly, pointed at the end, of a dark green colour, two at\r\nthe most part set at a place, very close and near together; about the\r\nmiddle of the leaf, on the back and lower side from the middle rib,\r\nbreaks forth a small whitish green flower, consisting of four small\r\nround pointed leaves, standing upon little or no footstalk, and in the\r\nplace whereof comes a small round berry, green at the first, and red\r\nwhen it is ripe, wherein are two or three white, hard, round seeds\r\ncontained. The root is thick, white and great at the head, and from\r\nthence sends forth divers thick, white, long, tough strings.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in copses, and upon heaths and waste grounds, and\r\noftentimes under or near the holly bushes.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It shoots forth its young buds in the Spring, and the berries\r\nare ripe about September, the branches of leaves abiding green all the\r\nWinter.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a plant of Mars, being of a gallant\r\ncleansing and opening quality. The decoction of the root made with\r\nwine opens obstructions, provokes urine, helps to expel gravel and the\r\nstone, the stranguary and women’s courses, also the yellow jaundice and\r\nthe head-ache; and with same honey or sugar put thereunto, cleanses\r\nthe breast of phlegm, and the chest of such clammy humours gathered\r\ntherein. The decoction of the root drank, and a poultice made of the\r\nberries and leaves applied, are effectual in knitting and consolidating\r\nbroken bones or parts out of joint. The common way of using it, is to\r\nboil the root of it, and Parsley and Fennel and Smallage in white wine,\r\nand drink the decoction, adding the like quantity of Grass-root to\r\nthem: The more of the root you boil, the stronger will the decoction\r\nbe; it works no ill effects, yet I hope you have wit enough to give the\r\nstrongest decoction to the strongest bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BROOM, AND BROOM-RAPE.\r\n\r\nTO spend time in writing a description hereof is altogether needless,\r\nit being so generally used by all the good housewives almost through\r\nthis land to sweep their houses with, and therefore very well known to\r\nall sorts of people.\r\n\r\nThe Broom-rape springs up in many places from the roots of the broom\r\n(but more often in fields, as by hedge-sides and on heaths). The stalk\r\nwhereof is of the bigness of a finger or thumb, above two feet high,\r\nhaving a shew of leaves on them, and many flowers at the top, of a\r\nreddish yellow colour, as also the stalks and leaves are.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow in many places of this land commonly, and as\r\ncommonly spoil all the land they grow in.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in the Summer months, and give their seed before\r\nWinter.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The juice or decoction of the young\r\nbranches, or seed, or the powder of the seed taken in drink purges\r\ndownwards, and draws phlegmatic and watery humours from the joints;\r\nwhereby it helps the dropsy, gout, sciatica, and pains of the hips and\r\njoints; it also provokes strong vomits, and helps the pains of the\r\nsides, and swelling of the spleen, cleanses also the reins or kidneys\r\nand bladder of the stone, provokes urine abundantly, and hinders the\r\ngrowing again of the stone in the body. The continual use of the powder\r\nof the leaves and seed doth cure the black jaundice. The distilled\r\nwater of the flowers is profitable for all the same purposes: it also\r\nhelps surfeit, and alters the fit of agues, if three or four ounces\r\nthereof, with as much of the water of the lesser Centaury, and a\r\nlittle sugar put therein, be taken a little before the fit comes, and\r\nthe party be laid down to sweat in his bed. The oil or water that is\r\ndrawn from the end of the green sticks heated in the fire, helps the\r\ntooth-ache. The juice of young branches made into an ointment of old\r\nhog’s grease, and anointed, or the young branches bruised and heated\r\nin oil or hog’s grease, and laid to the sides pained by wind, as in\r\nstitches, or the spleen, ease them in once or twice using it. The same\r\nboiled in oil is the safest and surest medicine to kill lice in the\r\nhead or body of any; and is an especial remedy for joint aches, and\r\nswollen knees, that come by the falling down of humours.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _The_ BROOM RAPE _also is not without its virtues_.\r\n\r\nTHE decoction thereof in wine, is thought to be as effectual to void\r\nthe stone in the kidney or bladder, and to provoke urine, as the Broom\r\nitself. The juice thereof is a singular good help to cure as well green\r\nwounds, as old and filthy sores and malignant ulcers. The insolate oil,\r\nwherein there has been three or four repetitions of infusion of the top\r\nstalks, with flowers strained and cleared, cleanses the skin from all\r\nmanner of spots, marks, and freckles that rise either by the heat of\r\nthe sun, or the malignity of humours. As for the Broom and Broom-rape,\r\nMars owns them, and is exceeding prejudicial to the liver, I suppose\r\nby reason of the antipathy between Jupiter and Mars; therefore if the\r\nliver be disaffected, minister none of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BUCK’S-HORN PLANTAIN.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS being sown of seed, rises up at first with small,\r\nlong, narrow, hairy, dark green leaves like grass, without any division\r\nor gash in them, but those that follow are gashed in on both sides the\r\nleaves into three or four gashes, and pointed at the ends, resembling\r\nthe knags of a buck’s horn (whereof it took its name), and being well\r\nwound round about the root upon the ground, in order one by another,\r\nthereby resembling the form of a star, from among which rise up divers\r\nhairy stalks, about a hand’s breadth high, bearing every one a small,\r\nlong spiky head, like to those of the common Plantain having such like\r\nbloomings and seed after them. The root is single, long and small, with\r\ndivers strings at it.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow in sandy grounds, as in Tothill-fields by\r\nWestminster, and divers other places of this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower and seed in May, June, and July, and their green\r\nleaves do in a manner abide fresh all the Winter.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of Saturn, and is\r\nof a gallant, drying, and binding quality. This boiled in wine and\r\ndrank, and some of the leaves put to the hurt place, is an excellent\r\nremedy for the biting of the viper or adder, which I take to be one\r\nand the same. The same being also drank, helps those that are troubled\r\nwith the stone in the reins or kidneys, by cooling the heat of the\r\npart afflicted, and strengthens them; also weak stomachs that cannot\r\nretain, but cast up their meat. It stays all bleeding both at mouth or\r\nnose; bloody urine or the bloody-flux, and stops the lask of the belly\r\nand bowels. The leaves hereof bruised and laid to their sides that have\r\nan ague, suddenly ease the fits; and the leaves and roots applied to\r\nthe wrists, works the same effect. The herb boiled in ale and wine, and\r\ngiven for some mornings and evenings together, stays the distillation\r\nof hot and sharp rheums falling into the eyes from the head, and helps\r\nall sorts of sore eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BUCK’S HORN.\r\n\r\nIT is called Hart’s-horn, Herba-stella and Herba-stellaria,\r\nSanguinaria, Herb-Eve, Herb-Ivy, Wort-Tresses, and Swine-Cresses.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] They have many small and weak straggled branches trailing\r\nhere and there upon the ground: The leaves are many, small and jagged,\r\nnot much unlike to those of Buck’s-horn Plantain, but much smaller,\r\nand not so hairy. The flowers grow among the leaves in small, rough,\r\nwhitish clusters; the seeds are smaller and brownish, of a bitter taste.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow in dry, barren, sandy grounds.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower and seed when the rest of the Plantains do.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] This is also under the dominion of Saturn;\r\nthe virtues are held to be the same as Buck’s-horn Plaintain, and\r\ntherefore by all authors it is joined with it. The leaves bruised and\r\napplied to the place, stop bleeding. The herbs bruised and applied to\r\nwarts, will make them consume and waste in a short time.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BUGLE.\r\n\r\nBESIDES the name Bugle, it is called Middle Confound and Middle\r\nComfrey, Brown Bugle, and by some Sicklewort, and Herb-Carpenter;\r\nthough in Essex we call another herb by that name.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] This has larger leaves than those of the Self-heal, but\r\nelse of the same fashion, or rather longer; in some green on the upper\r\nside, and in others more brownish, dented about the edges, somewhat\r\nhairy, as the square stalk is also which rises up to be half a yard\r\nhigh sometimes, with the leaves set by couples, from the middle almost,\r\nwhereof upwards stand the flowers, together with many smaller and\r\nbrowner leaves than the rest, on the stalk below set at distance, and\r\nthe stalk bare between them; among which flowers, are also small ones\r\nof a blueish and sometimes of an ash colour, fashioned like the flowers\r\nof Ground-ivy, after which come small, round blackish seeds. The root\r\nis composed of many strings, and spreads upon the ground.\r\n\r\nThe white flowered Bugle differs not in form or greatness from the\r\nformer, saving that the leaves and stalks are always green, and never\r\nbrown, like the other, and the flowers thereof are white.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow in woods, copses, and fields, generally throughout\r\nEngland, but the white flowered Bugle is not so plentiful as the former.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower from May until July, and in the mean time perfect\r\ntheir seed. The roots and leaves next thereunto upon the ground abiding\r\nall the Winter.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] This herb belongs to Dame Venus: If the\r\nvirtues of it makes you fall in love with it (as they will if you be\r\nwise) keep a syrup of it to take inwardly, an ointment and plaister of\r\nit to use outwardly, always by you.\r\n\r\nThe decoction of the leaves and flowers made in wine, and taken,\r\ndissolves the congealed blood in those that are bruised inwardly by a\r\nfall, or otherwise is very effectual for any inward wounds, thrusts,\r\nor stabs in the body or bowels; and it is an especial help in all\r\nwound-drinks, and for those that are liver-grown (as they call it.)\r\nIt is wonderful in curing all manner of ulcers and sores, whether new\r\nand fresh, or old and inveterate; yea, gangrenes and fistulas also,\r\nif the leaves bruised and applied, or their juice be used to wash and\r\nbathe the place; and the same made into a lotion, and some honey and\r\nalum, cures all sores in the mouth and gums, be they ever so foul, or\r\nof long continuance; and works no less powerfully and effectually for\r\nsuch ulcers and sores as happen in the secret parts of men and women.\r\nBeing also taken inwardly, or outwardly applied, it helps those that\r\nhave broken any bone, or have any member out of joint. An ointment made\r\nwith the leaves of Bugle, Scabions and Sanicle, bruised and boiled in\r\nhog’s grease, until the herbs be dry, and then strained forth into a\r\npot for such occasions as shall require; it is so singularly good for\r\nall sorts of hurts in the body, that none that know its usefulness will\r\nbe without it.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, I have known this herb cure some diseases of Saturn, of\r\nwhich I thought good to quote one. Many times such as give themselves\r\nmuch to drinking are troubled with strange fancies, strange sights\r\nin the night time, and some with voices, as also with the disease\r\nEphialtes, or the Mare. I take the reason of this to be (according\r\nto Fernelius) a melancholy vapour made thin by excessive drinking\r\nstrong liquor, and, so flies up and disturbs the fancy, and breeds\r\nimaginations like itself, viz. fearful and troublesome. Those I have\r\nknown cured by taking only two spoonfuls, of the syrup of this herb\r\nafter supper two hours, when you go to bed. But whether this does it\r\nby sympathy, or antipathy, is some doubt in astrology. I know there\r\nis great antipathy between Saturn and Venus in matter of procreation;\r\nyea, such a one, that the barrenness of Saturn can be removed by none\r\nbut Venus! nor the lust of Venus be repelled by none but Saturn; but\r\nI am not of opinion this is done this way, and my reason is, because\r\nthese vapours though in quality melancholy, yet by their flying upward,\r\nseem to be something aerial; therefore I rather think it is done by\r\nantipathy; Saturn being exalted in Libra, in the house of Venus.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BURNET.\r\n\r\nIT is called Sanguisorbia, Pimpinella, Bipulo, Solbegrella, &c.\r\nThe common garden Burnet is so well known, that it needs no\r\ndescription.—There is another sort which is wild, the description\r\nwhereof take as follows:—\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The great wild Burnet has winged leaves arising from\r\nthe roots like the garden Burnet, but not so many; yet each of these\r\nleaves are at the least twice as large as the other, and nicked in the\r\nsame manner about the edges, of a greyish colour on the under side;\r\nthe stalks are greater, and rise higher, with many such leaves set\r\nthereon, and greater heads at the top, of a brownish colour, and out of\r\nthem come small dark purple flowers, like the former, but greater. The\r\nroot is black and long like the other, but greater also: it has almost\r\nneither scent nor taste therein, like the garden kind.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It first grows frequently in gardens. The wild kind grows\r\nin divers counties of this land, especially in Huntingdon, in\r\nNorthamptonshire, in the meadows there: as also near London, by Pancras\r\nchurch, and by a causeway-side in the middle of a field by Paddington.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower about the end of June and beginning of July, and\r\ntheir seed is ripe in August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues_] This is an herb the Sun challenges dominion\r\nover, and is a most precious herb, little inferior to Betony; the\r\ncontinual use of it preserves the body in health, and the spirits in\r\nvigour; for if the Sun be the preserver of life under God, his herbs\r\nare the best in the world to do it by. They are accounted to be both of\r\none property, but the lesser is more effectual because quicker and more\r\naromatic: It is a friend to the heart, liver, and other principal parts\r\nof a man’s body. Two or three of the stalks, with leaves put into a cup\r\nof wine, especially claret, are known to quicken the spirits, refresh\r\nand cheer the heart, and drive away melancholy: It is a special help\r\nto defend the heart from noisome vapours, and from infection of the\r\npestilence, the juice thereof being taken in some drink, and the party\r\nlaid to sweat thereupon. They have also a drying and an astringent\r\nquality, whereby they are available in all manner of fluxes of blood\r\nor humours, to staunch bleedings inward or outward, lasks, scourings,\r\nthe bloody-flux, women’s too abundant flux of courses, the whites, and\r\nthe choleric belchings and castings of the stomach, and is a singular\r\nwound-herb for all sorts of wounds, both of the head and body, either\r\ninward or outward, for all old ulcers, running cankers, and most sores,\r\nto be used either by the juice or decoction of the herb, or by the\r\npowder of the herb or root, or the water of the distilled herb, or\r\nointment by itself, or with other things to be kept. The seed is also\r\nno less effectual both to stop fluxes, and dry up moist sores, being\r\ntaken in powder inwardly in wine, or steeled water, that is, wherein\r\nhot rods of steel have been quenched; or the powder, or the seed mixed\r\nwith the ointments.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE BUTTER-BUR, OR PETASITIS.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS rises up in February, with a thick stalk about a\r\nfoot high, whereon are set a few small leaves, or rather pieces, and\r\nat the top a long spiked head; flowers of a blue or deep red colour,\r\naccording to the soil where it grows, and before the stalk with the\r\nflowers have abiden a month above ground, it will be withered and gone,\r\nand blow away with the wind, and the leaves will begin to spring,\r\nwhich being full grown, are very large and broad, being somewhat thin\r\nand almost round, whose thick red foot stalks above a foot long,\r\nstand towards the middle of the leaves. The lower part being divided\r\ninto two round parts, close almost one to another, and are of a pale\r\ngreen colour; and hairy underneath. The root is long, and spreads\r\nunderground, being in some places no bigger than one’s finger, in\r\nothers much bigger, blackish on the outside, and whitish within, of a\r\nbitter and unpleasant taste.\r\n\r\n_Place and Time._] They grow in low and wet grounds by rivers and water\r\nsides. Their flower (as is said) rising and decaying in February and\r\nMarch, before their leaves, which appear in April.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of the Sun, and\r\ntherefore is a great strengthener of the heart, and clearer of the\r\nvital spirit. The roots thereof are by long experience found to be\r\nvery available against the plague and pestilential fevers by provoking\r\nsweat; if the powder thereof be taken in wine, it also resists the\r\nforce of any other poison. The root hereof taken with Zedoary and\r\nAngelica, or without them, helps the rising of the mother. The\r\ndecoction of the root in wine, is singularly good for those that wheese\r\nmuch, or are short-winded. It provokes urine also, and women’s courses,\r\nand kills the flat and broad worms in the belly. The powder of the root\r\ndoth wonderfully help to dry up the moisture of the sores that are hard\r\nto be cured, and takes away all spots and blemishes of the skin. It\r\nwere well if gentlewomen would keep this root preserved, to help their\r\npoor neighbours. _It is fit the rich should help the poor, for the poor\r\ncannot help themselves._\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE BURDOCK.\r\n\r\nTHEY are also called Personata, and Loppy-major, great Burdock and\r\nClod-bur. It is so well known, even by the little boys, who pull off\r\nthe burs to throw and stick upon each other, that I shall spare to\r\nwrite any description of it.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow plentifully by ditches and water-sides, and by the\r\nhighways almost everywhere through this land.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Venus challenges this herb for her own, and\r\nby its leaf or seed you may draw the womb which way you please, either\r\nupwards by applying it to the crown of the head, in case it falls out;\r\nor downwards in fits of the mother, by applying it to the soles of the\r\nfeet; or if you would stay it in its place, apply it to the navel,\r\nand that is one good way to stay the child in it. The Burdock leaves\r\nare cooling, moderately drying, and discussing withal, whereby it is\r\ngood for old ulcers and sores. A dram of the roots taken with Pine\r\nkernels, helps them that spit foul, mattery, and bloody phlegm. The\r\nleaves applied to the places troubled with the shrinking of the sinews\r\nor arteries, gives much ease. The juice of the leaves, or rather the\r\nroots themselves, given to drink with old wine, doth wonderfully help\r\nthe biting of any serpents: And the root beaten with a little salt, and\r\nlaid on the place, suddenly eases the pain thereof, and helps those\r\nthat are bit by a mad dog. The juice of the leaves being drank with\r\nhoney, provokes urine, and remedies the pain of the bladder. The seed\r\nbeing drank in wine forty days together, doth wonderfully help the\r\nsciatica. The leaves bruised with the white of an egg, and applied to\r\nany place burnt with fire, takes out the fire, gives sudden ease, and\r\nheals it up afterwards. The decoction of them fomented on any fretting\r\nsore, or canker, stays the corroding quality, which must be afterwards\r\nanointed with an ointment made of the same liquor, hog’s-grease,\r\nnitre, and vinegar boiled together. The roots may be preserved with\r\nsugar, and taken fasting, or at other times, for the same purposes, and\r\nfor consumptions, the stone, and the lask. The seed is much commended\r\nto break the stone, and cause it to be expelled by urine, and is often\r\nused with other seeds and things to that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CABBAGES AND COLEWORTS.\r\n\r\nI SHALL spare labour in writing a description of these, since almost\r\nevery one that can but write at all, may describe them from his own\r\nknowledge, they being generally so well known, that descriptions are\r\naltogether needless.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They are generally planted in gardens.\r\n\r\n_Time._] Their flower time is towards the middle, or end of July, and\r\nthe seed is ripe in August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The Cabbages or Coleworts boiled gently\r\nin broth, and eaten, do open the body, but the second decoction doth\r\nbind the body. The juice thereof drank in wine, helps those that are\r\nbitten by an adder, and the decoction of the flowers brings down\r\nwomen’s courses: Being taken with honey, it recovers hoarseness, or\r\nloss of the voice. The often eating of them well boiled, helps those\r\nthat are entering into a consumption. The pulp of the middle ribs of\r\nColeworts boiled in almond milk, and made up into an electuary with\r\nhoney, being taken often, is very profitable for those that are puffy\r\nand short winded. Being boiled twice, an old cock boiled in the broth\r\nand drank, it helps the pains and the obstructions of the liver and\r\nspleen, and the stone in the kidneys. The juice boiled with honey, and\r\ndropped into the corner of the eyes, clears the sight, by consuming\r\nany film or clouds beginning to dim it; it also consumes the cankers\r\ngrowing therein. They are much commended, being eaten before meat to\r\nkeep one from surfeiting, as also from being drunk with too much wine,\r\nor quickly to make a man sober again that was drunk before. For (as\r\nthey say) there is such an antipathy or enmity between the Vine and the\r\nColeworts, that the one will die where the other grows. The decoction\r\nof Coleworts takes away the pain and ache, and allays the swelling of\r\nsores and gouty legs and knees, wherein many gross and watery humours\r\nare fallen, the place being bathed therewith warm. It helps also old\r\nand filthy sores, being bathed therewith, and heals all small scabs,\r\npushes, and wheals, that break out in the skin. The ashes of Colewort\r\nstalks mixed with old hog’s-grease, are very effectual to anoint the\r\nsides of those that have had long pains therein, or any other place\r\npained with melancholy and windy humours. This was surely Chrysippus’s\r\nGod, and therefore he wrote a whole volume on them and their virtues,\r\nand that none of the least neither, for he would be no small fool; He\r\nappropriates them to every part of the body, and to every disease in\r\nevery part: and honest old Cato (they say) used no other physic. I know\r\nnot what metal their bodies were made of; this I am sure, Cabbages are\r\nextremely windy, whether you take them as meat or as medicine: yea,\r\nas windy meat as can be eaten, unless you eat bag-pipes or bellows,\r\nand they are but seldom eaten in our days; and Colewort flowers are\r\nsomething more tolerable, and the wholesomer food of the two. The Moon\r\nchallenges the dominion of this herb.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE SEA COLEWORTS.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS has divers somewhat long and broad large and thick\r\nwrinkled leaves, somewhat crumpled about the edges, and growing each\r\nupon a thick footstalks very brittle, of a greyish green colour, from\r\namong which rises up a strong thick stalk, two feet high and better,\r\nwith some leaves thereon to the top, where it branches forth much; and\r\non every branch stands a large bush of pale whitish flowers, consisting\r\nof four leaves a-piece: The root is somewhat great, shoots forth many\r\nbranches under ground, keeping the leaves green all the Winter.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow in many places upon the sea-coasts, as well on the\r\nKentish as Essex shores; as at Lid in Kent, Colchester in Essex, and\r\ndivers other places, and in other counties of this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower and seed about the time that other kinds do.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The Moon claims the dominion of these also.\r\nThe broth, or first decoction of the Sea Colewort, doth by the sharp,\r\nnitrous, and bitter qualities therein, open the belly, and purge the\r\nbody; it cleanses and digests more powerfully than the other kind: The\r\nseed hereof, bruised and drank, kills worms. The leaves or the juice of\r\nthem applied to sores or ulcers, cleanses and heals them, and dissolves\r\nswellings, and takes away inflammations.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CALAMINT, OR MOUNTAIN-MINT.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS is a small herb, seldom rising above a foot high,\r\nwith square hairy, and woody stalks, and two small hoary leaves set at\r\na joint, about the height of Marjoram, or not much bigger, a little\r\ndented about the edges, and of a very fierce or quick scent, as the\r\nwhole herb is: The flowers stand at several spaces of the stalk, from\r\nthe middle almost upwards, which are small and gaping like to those of\r\nthe Mints, of a pale bluish colour: After which follow small, round\r\nblackish seed. The root is small and woody, with divers small strings\r\nspreading within the ground, and dies not, but abides many years.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows on heaths, and uplands, and dry grounds, in many\r\nplaces of this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in July and their seed is ripe quickly after.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of Mercury, and a strong\r\none too, therefore excellent good in all afflictions of the brain.\r\nThe decoction of the herb being drank, brings down women’s courses,\r\nand provokes urine. It is profitable for those that are bursten, or\r\ntroubled with convulsions or cramps, with shortness of breath, or\r\ncholeric torments and pains in their bellies or stomach; it also helps\r\nthe yellow-jaundice, and stays vomiting, being taken in wine. Taken\r\nwith salt and honey, it kills all manner of worms in the body. It\r\nhelps such as have the leprosy, either taken inwardly, drinking whey\r\nafter it, or the green herb outwardly applied. It hinders conception\r\nin women, but either burned or strewed in the chamber, it drives away\r\nvenomous serpents. It takes away black and blue marks in the face, and\r\nmakes black scars become well coloured, if the green herb (not the\r\ndry) be boiled in wine, and laid to the place, or the place washed\r\ntherewith. Being applied to the hucklebone, by continuance of time, it\r\nspends the humours, which cause the pain of the sciatica. The juice\r\nbeing dropped into the ears, kills the worms in them. The leaves boiled\r\nin wine, and drank, provoke sweat, and open obstructions of the liver\r\nand spleen. It helps them that have a tertian ague (the body being\r\nfirst purged) by taking away the cold fits. The decoction hereof, with\r\nsome sugar put thereto afterwards, is very profitable for those that\r\nbe troubled with the over-flowing of the gall, and that have an old\r\ncough, and that are scarce able to breathe by shortness of their wind;\r\nthat have any cold distemper in their bowels, and are troubled with\r\nthe hardness or the spleen, for all which purposes, both the powder,\r\ncalled Diacaluminthes, and the compound Syrup of Calamint are the most\r\neffectual. Let no women be too busy with it, for it works very violent\r\nupon the feminine part.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CAMOMILE.\r\n\r\nIT is so well known every where, that it is but lost time and labour to\r\ndescribe it. The virtues thereof are as follow.\r\n\r\nA decoction made of Camomile, and drank, takes away all pains and\r\nstitches in the side. The flowers of Camomile beaten, and made up into\r\nballs with Gill, drive away all sorts of agues, if the part grieved be\r\nanointed with that oil, taken from the flowers, from the crown of the\r\nhead to the sole of the foot, and afterwards laid to sweat in his bed,\r\nand that he sweats well. This is Nechessor, an Egyptian’s, medicine. It\r\nis profitable for all sorts of agues that come either from phlegm, or\r\nmelancholy, or from an inflammation of the bowels, being applied when\r\nthe humours causing them shall be concocted; and there is nothing more\r\nprofitable to the sides and region of the liver and spleen than it. The\r\nbathing with a decoction of Camomile takes away weariness, eases pains,\r\nto what part of the body soever they be applied. It comforts the sinews\r\nthat are over-strained, mollifies all swellings: It moderately comforts\r\nall parts that have need of warmth, digests and dissolves whatsoever\r\nhas need thereof, by a wonderful speedy property. It eases all pains\r\nof the cholic and stone, and all pains and torments of the belly, and\r\ngently provokes urine. The flowers boiled in posset-drink provokes\r\nsweat, and helps to expel all colds, aches, and pains whatsoever, and\r\nis an excellent help to bring down women’s courses. Syrup made of\r\nthe juice of Camomile, with the flowers, in white wine, is a remedy\r\nagainst the jaundice and dropsy. The flowers boiled in lye, are good\r\nto wash the head, and comfort both it and the brain. The oil made\r\nof the flowers of Camomile, is much used against all hard swellings,\r\npains or aches, shrinking of the sinews, or cramps, or pains in the\r\njoints, or any other part of the body. Being used in clysters, it helps\r\nto dissolve the wind and pains in the belly; anointed also, it helps\r\nstitches and pains in the sides.\r\n\r\nNechessor saith, the Egyptians dedicated it to the Sun, because it\r\ncured agues, and they were like enough to do it, for they were the\r\narrantest apes in their religion that I ever read of. Bachinus, Bena,\r\nand Lobel, commend the syrup made of the juice of it and sugar, taken\r\ninwardly, to be excellent for the spleen. Also this is certain, that it\r\nmost wonderfully breaks the stone: Some take it in syrup or decoction,\r\nothers inject the juice of it into the bladder with a syringe. My\r\nopinion is, that the salt of it, taken half a dram in the morning in\r\na little white or Rhenish wine, is better than either; that it is\r\nexcellent for the stone, appears in this which I have seen tried,\r\n_viz._, That a stone that has been taken out of the body of a man being\r\nwrapped in Camomile, will in time dissolve, and in a little time too.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WATER-CALTROPS.\r\n\r\nTHEY are called also Tribulus Aquaticus, Tribulus Lacusoris, Tribulus\r\nMarinus, Caltrops, Saligos, Water Nuts, and Water Chesnuts.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] As for the greater sort of Water Caltrop it is not found\r\nhere, or very rarely. Two other sorts there are which I shall here\r\ndescribe. The first has a long creeping and jointed root, sending\r\nforth tufts at each joint, from which joints rise long, flat, slender,\r\nknotted stalks, even to the top of the water, divided towards the top\r\ninto many branches, each carrying two leaves on both sides, being about\r\ntwo inches long, and half an inch broad, thin and almost transparent;\r\nthey look as though they were torn; the flowers are long, thick, and\r\nwhitish, set together almost like a bunch of grapes, which being gone,\r\nthere succeed, for the most part, sharp pointed grains all together,\r\ncontaining a small white kernel in them.\r\n\r\nThe second differs not much from this, save that it delights in more\r\nclean water; its stalks are not flat, but round; its leaves are not so\r\nlong, but more pointed. As for the place we need not determine, for\r\ntheir name shews they grow in water.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] They are under the dominion of the Moon, and\r\nbeing made into a poultice, are excellently good for hot inflammations,\r\nswellings, cankers, sore mouths and throats, being washed with the\r\ndecoction; it cleanses and strengthens the neck and throat, and helps\r\nthose swellings which, when people have, they say the almonds of the\r\nears are fallen down. It is excellently good for the rankness of the\r\ngums, a safe and present remedy for the king’s evil. They are excellent\r\nfor the stone and gravel, especially the nuts, being dried. They also\r\nresist poison, and bitings of venomous beasts.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CAMPION, WILD.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THE wild White Campion has many long and somewhat broad\r\ndark green leaves lying upon the ground, and divers ribs therein,\r\nsomewhat like plantain, but somewhat hairy, broader, but not so long.\r\nThe hairy stalks rise up in the middle of them three or four feet high,\r\nand sometimes more, with divers great white joints at several places\r\nthereon, and two such like leaves thereat up to the top, sending forth\r\nbranches at several joints also; all which bear on several foot-stalks\r\nwhite flowers at the tops of them, consisting of five broad pointed\r\nleaves, every one cut in on the end unto the middle, making them seem\r\nto be two a-piece, smelling somewhat sweet, and each of them standing\r\nin a large green striped hairy husk, large and round below next to the\r\nstalk. The seed is small and greyish in the hard heads that come up\r\nafterwards. The root is white and long, spreading divers fangs in the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe Red wild Campion grows in the same manner as the White; but its\r\nleaves are not so plainly ribbed, somewhat shorter, rounder, and more\r\nwoolly in handling. The flowers are of the same form and bigness; but\r\nin some of a pale, in others of a bright red colour, cut in at the ends\r\nmore finely, which makes the leaves look more in number than the other.\r\nThe seeds and the roots are alike, the roots of both sorts abiding many\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThere are forty-five kinds of Campion more, those of them which are of\r\na physical use, having the like virtues with those above described,\r\nwhich I take to be the two chief kinds.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow commonly through this land by fields and\r\nhedge-sides, and ditches.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in Summer, some earlier than others, and some\r\nabiding longer than others.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] They belong to Saturn, and it is found by\r\nexperience, that the decoction of the herb, either in white or red wine\r\nbeing drank, doth stay inward bleedings, and applied outwardly it does\r\nthe like; and being drank, helps to expel urine, being stopped, and\r\ngravel and stone in the reins and kidneys. Two drams of the seed drank\r\nin wine, purges the body of choleric humours, and helps those that are\r\nstung by scorpions, or other venomous beasts, and may be as effectual\r\nfor the plague. It is of very good use in old sores, ulcers, cankers,\r\nfistulas, and the like, to cleanse and heat them, by consuming the\r\nmoist humours falling into them and correcting the putrefaction of\r\nhumours offending them.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CARDUUS BENEDICTUS.\r\n\r\nIT is called Carduus Benedictus, or Blessed Thistle, or Holy Thistle.\r\nI suppose the name was put upon it by some that had little holiness\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nI shall spare a labour in writing a description of this as almost every\r\none that can but write at all, may describe them from his own knowledge.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in August, and seed not long after.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of Mars, and under the sign\r\nof Aries. Now, in handling this herb, I shall give you a rational\r\npattern of all the rest; and if you please to view them throughout the\r\nbook, you shall, to your content, find it true. It helps swimming and\r\ngiddiness of the head, or the disease called vertigo, because Aries\r\nis in the house of Mars. It is an excellent remedy against the yellow\r\njaundice and other infirmities of the gall, because Mars governs\r\ncholer. It strengthens the attractive faculty in man, and clarifies the\r\nblood, because the one is ruled by Mars. The continual drinking the\r\ndecoction of it, helps red faces, tetters, and ring-worms, because Mars\r\ncauses them. It helps the plague, sores, boils, and itch, the bitings\r\nof mad dogs and venomous beasts, all which infirmities are under Mars;\r\nthus you see what it doth by sympathy.\r\n\r\nBy antipathy to other planets it cures the French pox. By antipathy to\r\nVenus, who governs it, it strengthens the memory, and cures deafness by\r\nantipathy to Saturn, who has his fall in Aries, which rules the head.\r\nIt cures quartan agues, and other diseases of melancholy, and adust\r\ncholer, by sympathy to Saturn, Mars being exalted in Capricorn. Also\r\nprovokes urine, the stopping of which is usually caused by Mars or the\r\nMoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CARROTS.\r\n\r\nGARDEN Carrots are so well known, that they need no description; but\r\nbecause they are of less physical use than the wild kind (as indeed\r\nalmost in all herbs the wild are the most effectual in physic, as being\r\nmore powerful in operation than the garden kinds,) I shall therefore\r\nbriefly describe the Wild Carrot.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] It grows in a manner altogether like the tame, but that\r\nthe leaves and stalks are somewhat whiter and rougher. The stalks bear\r\nlarge tufts of white flowers, with a deep purple spot in the middle,\r\nwhich are contracted together when the seed begins to ripen, that the\r\nmiddle part being hollow and low, and the outward stalk rising high,\r\nmakes the whole umbel to show like a bird’s nest. The root small, long,\r\nand hard, and unfit for meat, being somewhat sharp and strong.\r\n\r\n_Place._] The wild kind grows in divers parts of this land plentifully\r\nby the field-sides, and untilled places.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower and seed in the end of Summer.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Wild Carrots belong to Mercury, and\r\ntherefore break wind, and remove stitches in the sides, provoke urine\r\nand women’s courses, and helps to break and expel the stone; the seed\r\nalso of the same works the like effect, and is good for the dropsy,\r\nand those whose bellies are swelling with wind; helps the cholic, the\r\nstone in the kidneys, and rising of the mother; being taken in wine, or\r\nboiled in wine and taken, it helps conception. The leaves being applied\r\nwith honey to running sores or ulcers, do cleanse them.\r\n\r\nI suppose the seeds of them perform this better than the roots; and\r\nthough Galen commended garden Carrots highly to break wind, yet\r\nexperience teaches they breed it first, and we may thank nature for\r\nexpelling it, not they; the seeds of them expel wind indeed, and so\r\nmend what the root marrs.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CARRAWAY.\r\n\r\nIT is on account of the seeds principally that the Carraway is\r\ncultivated.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] It bears divers stalks of fine cut leaves, lying upon the\r\nground, somewhat like to the leaves of carrots, but not bushing so\r\nthick, of a little quick taste in them, from among which rises up a\r\nsquare stalk, not so high as the Carrot, at whose joints are set the\r\nlike leaves, but smaller and finer, and at the top small open tufts, or\r\numbels of white flowers, which turn into small blackish seed, smaller\r\nthan the Anniseed, and of a quicker and hotter taste. The root is\r\nwhitish, small and long, somewhat like unto a parsnip, but with more\r\nwrinkled bark, and much less, of a little hot and quick taste, and\r\nstronger than the parsnip, and abides after seed-time.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It is usually sown with us in gardens.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in June and July, and seed quickly after.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] This is also a Mercurial plant. Carraway\r\nseed has a moderate sharp quality, whereby it breaks wind and provokes\r\nurine, which also the herb doth. The root is better food than the\r\nparsnip; it is pleasant and comfortable to the stomach, and helps\r\ndigestion. The seed is conducing to all cold griefs of the head and\r\nstomach, bowels, or mother, as also the wind in them, and helps to\r\nsharpen the eye-sight. The powder of the seed put into a poultice,\r\ntakes away black and blue spots of blows and bruises. The herb itself,\r\nor with some of the seed bruised and fried, laid hot in a bag or double\r\ncloth, to the lower parts of the belly, eases the pains of the wind\r\ncholic.\r\n\r\nThe roots of Carraway eaten as men do parsnips, strengthen the stomach\r\nof ancient people exceedingly, and they need not to make a whole meal\r\nof them neither, and are fit to be planted in every garden.\r\n\r\nCarraway comfits, once only dipped in sugar, and half a spoonful of\r\nthem eaten in the morning fasting, and as many after each meal, is a\r\nmost admirable remedy, for those that are troubled with wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CELANDINE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS hath divers tender, round, whitish green stalks,\r\nwith greater joints than ordinary in other herbs as it were knees,\r\nvery brittle and easy to break, from whence grow branches with large\r\ntender broad leaves, divided into many parts, each of them cut in on\r\nthe edges, set at the joint on both sides of the branches, of a dark\r\nblueish green colour, on the upper side like Columbines, and of a more\r\npale blueish green underneath, full of yellow sap, when any is broken,\r\nof a bitter taste, and strong scent. At the flowers, of four leaves\r\na-piece, after which come small long pods, with blackish seed therein.\r\nThe root is somewhat great at the head, shooting forth divers long\r\nroots and small strings, reddish on the outside, and yellow within,\r\nfull of yellow sap therein.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow in many places by old walls, hedges and way-sides\r\nin untilled places; and being once planted in a garden, especially some\r\nshady places, it will remain there.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower all the Summer, and the seed ripens in the mean\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] This is an herb of the Sun, and under the\r\nCelestial Lion, and is one of the best cures for the eyes; for, all\r\nthat know any thing in astrology, know that the eyes are subject to the\r\nluminaries; let it then be gathered when the Sun is in Leo, and the\r\nMoon in Aries, applying to this time; let Leo arise, then may you make\r\ninto an oil or ointment, which you please, to anoint your sore eyes\r\nwith. I can prove it doth both my own experience, and the experience of\r\nthose to whom I have taught it, that most desperate sore eyes have been\r\ncured by this only medicine; and then, I pray, is not this far better\r\nthan endangering the eyes by the art of the needle? For if this does\r\nnot absolutely take away the film, it will so facilitate the work, that\r\nit might be done without danger. The herb or root boiled in white Wine\r\nand drank, a few Anniseeds being boiled therewith, opens obstructions\r\nof the liver and gall, helps the yellow jaundice; and often using it,\r\nhelps the dropsy and the itch, and those who have old sores in their\r\nlegs, or other parts of the body. The juice thereof taken fasting, is\r\nheld to be of singularly good use against the pestilence. The distilled\r\nwater, with a little sugar and a little good treacle mixed therewith\r\n(the party upon the taking being laid down to sweat a little) has\r\nthe same effect. The juice dropped into the eyes, cleanses them from\r\nfilms and cloudiness which darken the sight, but it is best to allay\r\nthe sharpness of the juice with a little breast milk. It is good in\r\nall old filthy corroding creeping ulcers wheresoever, to stay their\r\nmalignity of fretting and running, and to cause them to heal more\r\nspeedily: The juice often applied to tetters, ring-worms, or other such\r\nlike spreading cankers, will quickly heal them, and rubbed often upon\r\nwarts, will take them away. The herb with the roots bruised and bathed\r\nwith oil of camomile, and applied to the navel, takes away the griping\r\npains of the belly and bowels, and all the pains of the mother; and\r\napplied to women’s breasts stays the overmuch flowing of the courses.\r\nThe juice or decoction of the herb gargled between the teeth that ach,\r\neases the pain, and the powder of the dried root laid upon any aching,\r\nhollow or loose tooth, will cause it to fall out. The juice mixed with\r\nsome powder of brimstone is not only good against the itch, but takes\r\naway all discolourings of the skin whatsoever: and if it chance that in\r\na tender body it causes any itchings or inflammations, by bathing the\r\nplace with a little vinegar it is helped.\r\n\r\nAnother ill-favoured trick have physicians got to use to the eye, and\r\nthat is worse than the needle; which is to take away the films by\r\ncorroding or gnawing medicine. That I absolutely protest against.\r\n\r\n1. Because the tunicles of the eyes are very thin, and therefore soon\r\neaten asunder.\r\n\r\n2. The callus or film that they would eat away, is seldom of an equal\r\nthickness in every place, and then the tunicle may be eaten asunder in\r\none place, before the film be consumed in another, and so be a readier\r\nway to extinguish the sight than to restore it.\r\n\r\nIt is called Chelidonium, from the Greek word _Chelidon_, which\r\nsignifies a swallow; because they say, that if you put out the eyes of\r\nyoung swallows when they are in the nest, the old ones will recover\r\ntheir eyes again with this herb. This I am confident, for I have tried\r\nit, that if we mar the very apple of their eyes with a needle, she will\r\nrecover them again; but whether with this herb or not, I know not.\r\n\r\nAlso I have read (and it seems to be somewhat probable) that the herb,\r\nbeing gathered as I shewed before, and the elements draw apart from it\r\nby art of the alchymist, and after they are drawn apart rectified, the\r\nearthly quality, still in rectifying them, added to the _Terra damnata_\r\n(as Alchymists call it) or _Terra Sacratisima_ (as some philosophers\r\ncall it) the elements so rectified are sufficient for the cure of all\r\ndiseases, the humours offending being known and the contrary element\r\ngiven: It is an experiment worth the trying, and can do no harm.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE LESSER CELANDINE, USUALLY KNOWN BY THE NAME OF PILEWORT\r\n    AND FOGWORT.\r\n\r\nI WONDER what ailed the ancients to give this the name Celandine,\r\nwhich resembles it neather in nature nor form; it acquired the name of\r\nPilewort from its virtues, and it being no great matter where I set it\r\ndown, so I set it down at all, I humoured Dr. Tradition so much, as to\r\nset him down here.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] This Celandine or Pilewort (which you please) doth spread\r\nmany round pale green leaves, set on weak and trailing branches which\r\nlie upon the ground, and are flat, smooth, and somewhat shining, and in\r\nsome places (though seldom) marked with black spots, each standing on a\r\nlong foot-stalk, among which rise small yellow flowers, consisting of\r\nnine or ten small narrow leaves, upon slender foot-stalks, very like\r\nunto Crowsfoot, whereunto the seed also is not unlike being many small\r\nkernels like a grain of corn sometimes twice as long as others, of a\r\nwhitish colour, with fibres at the end of them.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows for the most part in moist corners of fields and\r\nplaces that are near water sides, yet will abide in drier ground if\r\nthey be a little shady.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers betimes, about March or April, is quite gone by\r\nMay; so it cannot be found till it spring again.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of Mars, and behold\r\nhere another verification of the learning of the ancients, _viz._ that\r\nthe virtue of an herb may be known by its signature, as plainly appears\r\nin this; for if you dig up the root of it, you shall perceive the\r\nperfect image of the disease which they commonly call the piles. It is\r\ncertain by good experience, that the decoction of the leaves and roots\r\nwonderfully helps piles and hæmorrhoids, also kernels by the ears and\r\nthroat, called the king’s evil, or any other hard wens or tumours.\r\n\r\nHere’s another secret for my countrymen and women, a couple of them\r\ntogether; Pilewort made into an oil, ointment, or plaister, readily\r\ncures both the piles, or hæmorrhoids, and the king’s evil: The very\r\nherb borne about one’s body next the skin helps in such diseases,\r\nthough it never touch the place grieved; let poor people make much of\r\nit for those uses; with this I cured my own daughter of the king’s\r\nevil, broke the sore, drew out a quarter of a pint of corruption, cured\r\nwithout any scar at all in one week’s time.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE ORDINARY SMALL CENTAURY.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS grows up most usually but with one round and somewhat\r\ncrusted stalk, about a foot high or better, branching forth at the top\r\ninto many sprigs, and some also from the joints of the stalks below;\r\nthe flowers thus stand at the tops as it were in one umbel or tuft,\r\nare of a pale red, tending to carnation colour, consisting of five,\r\nsometimes six small leaves, very like those of St. John’s Wort, opening\r\nthemselves in the day time and closing at night, after which come seeds\r\nin little short husk, in forms like unto wheat corn. The leaves are\r\nsmall and somewhat round; the root small and hard, perishing every\r\nyear. The whole plant is of an exceeding bitter taste.\r\n\r\nThere is another sort in all things like the former, save only it bears\r\nwhite flowers.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow ordinarily in fields, pastures, and woods, but that\r\nwith the white flowers not so frequently as the other.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in July or thereabouts, and seeds within a month\r\nafter.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] They are under the dominion of the Sun, as\r\nappears in that their flowers open and shut as the Sun, either shews\r\nor hides his face. This herb, boiled and drank, purges choleric and\r\ngross humours, and helps the sciatica; it opens obstructions of the\r\nliver, gall, and spleen, helps the jaundice, and eases the pains in the\r\nsides and hardness of the spleen, used outwardly, and is given with\r\nvery good effect in agues. It helps those that have the dropsy, or the\r\ngreen-sickness, being much used by the Italians in powder for that\r\npurpose. It kill the worms in the belly, as is found by experience.\r\nThe decoction thereof, _viz._ the tops of the stalks, with the leaves\r\nand flowers, is good against the cholic, and to bring down women’s\r\ncourses, helps to avoid the dead birth, and eases pains of the mother,\r\nand is very effectual in all pains of the joints, as the gout, cramps,\r\nor convulsions. A dram of the powder taken in wine is a wonderful good\r\nhelp against the biting and poison of an adder. The juice of the herb\r\nwith a little honey put to it, is good to clear the eyes from dimness,\r\nmists and clouds that offend or hinder sight. It is singularly good\r\nboth for green and fresh wounds, as also for old ulcers and sores, to\r\nclose up the one and cleanse the other, and perfectly to cure them\r\nboth, although they are hollow or fistulous; the green herb especially,\r\nbeing bruised and laid thereto. The decoction thereof dropped into the\r\nears, cleanses them from worms, cleanses the foul ulcers and spreading\r\nscabs of the head, and takes away all freckles, spots, and marks in the\r\nskin, being washed with it; the herb is so safe you cannot fail in the\r\nusing of it, only giving it inwardly for inward diseases. It is very\r\nwholesome, but not very toothsome.\r\n\r\nThere is beside these, another small Centaury, which bears a yellow\r\nflower; in all other respects it is like the former, save that the\r\nleaves are larger, and of a darker green, and the stalks pass through\r\nthe midst of them, as it does in the herb Thorowan. They are all of\r\nthem, as I told you, under the government of the Sun; yet this, if\r\nyou observe it, you shall find an excellant truth; in diseases of the\r\nblood, use the red Centaury; if of choler, use the yellow; but if\r\nphlegm or water, you will find the white best.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE CHERRY-TREE.\r\n\r\nI SUPPOSE there are few but know this tree, for its fruit’s sake; and\r\ntherefore I shall spare writing a description thereof.\r\n\r\n_Place._] For the place of its growth, it is afforded room in every\r\norchard.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a tree of _Venus_. Cherries, as they\r\nare of different tastes, so they are of different qualities. The sweet\r\npass through the stomach and the belly more speedily, but are of little\r\nnourishment; the tart or sour are more pleasing to an hot stomach,\r\nprocure appetite to meat, to help and cut tough phlegm, and gross\r\nhumours; but when these are dried, they are more binding to the belly\r\nthan when they are fresh, being cooling in hot diseases, and welcome to\r\nthe stomach, and provokes urine. The gum of the Cherry-tree, desolved\r\nin wine is good for a cold, cough, and hoarseness of the throat; mends\r\nthe colour in the face, sharpens the eye-sight, provokes appetite, and\r\nhelps to break and expel the stone, and dissolved, the water thereof is\r\nmuch used to break the stone, and to expel gravel and wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WINTER-CHERRIES.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THE Winter Cherry has a running or creeping root in the\r\nground, of the bigness many times one’s little finger, shooting forth\r\nat several joints in several places, whereby it quickly spreads a great\r\ncompass of ground. The stalk rises not above a yard high, whereon are\r\nset many broad and long green leaves, somewhat like nightshades, but\r\nlarger; at the joints, whereof come forth whitish flowers made of five\r\nleaves a piece, which afterwards turn into green berries inclosed with\r\nthin skins, which change to be reddish when they grow ripe, the berry\r\nlikewise being reddish, and as large as a cherry; wherein are contained\r\nmany flat and yellowish seeds lying within the pulp, which being\r\ngathered and strung up, are kept all the year to be used upon occasions.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow not naturally in this land, but are cherished in\r\ngardens for their virtues.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower not until the middle or latter end of July; and\r\nthe fruit is ripe about August, or the beginning of September.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] This also is a plant of Venus. They are\r\nof great use in physic: The leaves being cooling, may be used in\r\ninflammations, but not opening as the berries and fruit are; which\r\nby drawing down the urine provoke it to be voided plentifully when\r\nit is stopped or grown hot, sharp, and painful in the passage; it is\r\ngood also to expel the stone and gravel out of the reins, kidneys and\r\nbladder, helping to dissolve the stone, and voiding it by grit or\r\ngravel sent forth in the urine; it also helps much to cleanse inward\r\nimposthumes or ulcers in the reins of bladder, or in those that void a\r\nbloody or foul urine. The distilled water of the fruit, or the leaves\r\ntogether with them, or the berries, green or dry, distilled with a\r\nlittle milk and drank morning and evening with a little sugar, is\r\neffectual to all the purposes before specified, and especially against\r\nthe heat and sharpness of the urine. I shall only mention one way,\r\namongst many others, which might be used for ordering the berries, to\r\nbe helpful for the urine and the stone; which is this: Take three or\r\nfour good handfuls of the berries, either green or fresh, or dried, and\r\nhaving bruised them, put them into so many gallons of beer or ale when\r\nit is new tunned up: This drink taken daily, has been found to do much\r\ngood to many, both to ease the pains, and expel urine and the stone,\r\nand to cause the stone not to engender. The decoction of the berries in\r\nwine and water is the most usual way; but the powder of them taken in\r\ndrink is more effectual.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHERVIL.\r\n\r\nIT is called Cerefolium, Mirrhis, and Mirrha, Chervil, Sweet Chervil,\r\nand Sweet Cicely.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The garden Chervil doth at first somewhat resemble\r\nParsley, but after it is better grown, the leaves are much cut in and\r\njagged, resembling hemlock, being a little hairy and of a whitish green\r\ncolour, sometimes turning reddish in the Summer, with the stalks also;\r\nit rises a little above half a foot high, bearing white flowers in\r\nspiked tufts, which turn into long and round seeds pointed at the ends,\r\nand blackish when they are ripe; of a sweet taste, but no smell, though\r\nthe herb itself smells reasonably well. The root is small and long, and\r\nperishes every year, and must be sown a-new in spring, for seed after\r\nJuly for Autumn fails.\r\n\r\nThe wild Chervil grows two or three feet high with yellow stalks and\r\njoints, set with broader and more hairy leaves, divided into sundry\r\nparts, nicked about the edges, and of a dark green colour, which\r\nlikewise grow reddish with the stalks; at the tops whereof stands small\r\nwhite tufts, of flowers, afterwards smaller and longer seed. The root\r\nis white, hard, and enduring long. This has little or no scent.\r\n\r\n_Place._] The first is sown in gardens for a sallad herb; the second\r\ngrows wild in many of the meadows of this land, and by the hedge sides,\r\nand on heaths.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower and seed early, and thereupon are sown again in\r\nthe end of Summer.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The garden Chervil being eaten, doth\r\nmoderately warm the stomach, and is a certain remedy (saith Tragus)\r\nto dissolve congealed or clotted blood in the body, or that which is\r\nclotted by bruises, falls, &c. The juice or distilled water thereof\r\nbeing drank, and the bruised leaves laid to the place, being taken\r\neither in meat or drink, it is good to help to provoke urine, or expel\r\nthe stone in the kidneys, to send down women’s courses, and to help the\r\npleurisy and pricking of the sides.\r\n\r\nThe wild Chervil bruised and applied, dissolves swellings in any part,\r\nor the marks of congealed blood by bruises or blows, in a little space.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SWEET CHERVIL, OR SWEET CICELY.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS grows very like the great hemlock, having large\r\nspread leaves cut into divers parts, but of a fresher green colour\r\nthan the Hemlock, tasting as sweet as the Anniseed. The stalks rise up\r\na yard high, or better, being creased or hollow, having leaves at the\r\njoints, but lesser; and at the tops of the branched stalks, umbels or\r\ntufts of white flowers; after which comes long crested black shining\r\nseed, pointed at both ends, tasting quick, yet sweet and pleasant. The\r\nroot is great and white, growing deep in the ground, and spreading\r\nsundry long branches therein, in taste and smell stronger than the\r\nleaves or seeds, and continuing many years.\r\n\r\n_Place._] This grows in gardens.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] These are all three of them of the nature\r\nof Jupiter, and under his dominion. This whole plant, besides its\r\npleasantness in sallads, has its physical virtue. The root boiled, and\r\neaten with oil and vinegar, (or without oil) do much please and warm\r\nold and cold stomachs oppressed with wind or phlegm, or those that have\r\nthe phthisic or consumption of the lungs. The same drank with wine is a\r\npreservation from the plague. It provokes women’s courses, and expels\r\nthe after-birth, procures an appetite to meat, and expels wind. The\r\njuice is good to heal the ulcers of the head and face; the candied root\r\nhereof are held as effectual as Angelica, to preserve from infection in\r\nthe time of a plague, and to warm and comfort a cold weak stomach. It\r\nis so harmless, you cannot use it amiss.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHESNUT TREE.\r\n\r\nIT were as needless to describe a tree so commonly known as to tell a\r\nman he had gotten a mouth; therefore take the government and virtues of\r\nthem thus:\r\n\r\nThe tree is abundantly under the dominion of Jupiter, and therefore the\r\nfruit must needs breed good blood, and yield commendable nourishment to\r\nthe body; yet if eaten over-much, they make the blood thick, procure\r\nhead ache, and bind the body; the inner skin, that covers the nut, is\r\nof so binding a quality, that a scruple of it being taken by a man, or\r\nten grains by a child, soon stops any flux whatsoever: The whole nut\r\nbeing dried and beaten into powder, and a dram taken at a time, is a\r\ngood remedy to stop the terms in women. If you dry Chesnuts, (only the\r\nkernels I mean) both the barks being taken away, beat them into powder,\r\nand make the powder up into an electuary with honey, so have you an\r\nadmirable remedy for the cough and spitting of blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n    EARTH CHESNUTS.\r\n\r\nTHEY are called Earth-nuts, Earth Chesnuts, Ground Nuts, Ciper-nuts,\r\nand in Sussex Pig-nuts. A description of them were needless, for every\r\nchild knows them.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] They are something hot and dry in quality,\r\nunder the dominion of Venus, they provoke lust exceedingly, and stir\r\nup to those sports she is mistress of; the seed is excellent good to\r\nprovoke urine; and so also is the root, but it doth not perform it\r\nso forcibly as the seed doth. The root being dried and beaten into\r\npowder, and the powder made into an electuary, is as singular a remedy\r\nfor spitting and pissing of blood, as the former Chesnut was for coughs.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHICKWEED.\r\n\r\nIT is so generally known to most people, that I shall not trouble\r\nyou with the description thereof, nor myself with setting forth the\r\nseveral kinds, since but only two or three are considerable for their\r\nusefulness.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They are usually found in moist and watery places, by wood\r\nsides, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower about June, and their seed is ripe in July.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a fine soft pleasing herb under the\r\ndominion of the Moon. It is found to be effectual as Purslain to all\r\nthe purposes whereunto it serves, except for meat only. The herb\r\nbruised, or the juice applied (with cloths or sponges dipped therein)\r\nto the region of the liver, and as they dry, to have it fresh applied,\r\ndoth wonderfully temperate the heat of the liver, and is effectual\r\nfor all imposthumes and swellings whatsoever, for all redness in the\r\nface, wheals, pushes, itch, scabs; the juice either simply used, or\r\nboiled with hog’s grease and applied, helps cramps, convulsions, and\r\npalsy. The juice, or distilled water, is of much good use for all heats\r\nand redness in the eyes, to drop some thereof into them; as also into\r\nthe ears, to ease pains in them; and is of good effect to ease pains\r\nfrom the heat and sharpness of the blood in the piles, and generally\r\nall pains in the body that arise of heat. It is used also in hot and\r\nvirulent ulcers and sores in the privy parts of men and women, or on\r\nthe legs, or elsewhere. The leaves boiled with marsh-mallows, and made\r\ninto a poultice with fenugreek and linseed, applied to swellings or\r\nimposthumes, ripen and break them, or assuage the swellings and ease\r\nthe pains. It helps the sinews when they are shrunk by cramps, or\r\notherwise, and to extend and make them pliable again by this medicine.\r\nBoil a handful of Chickweed, and a handful of red rose leaves dried, in\r\na quart of muscadine, until a fourth part be consumed; then put to them\r\na pint of oil of trotters or sheep’s feet; let them boil a good while,\r\nstill stirring them well; which being strained, anoint the grieved\r\nplace therewith, warm against the fire, rubbing it well with one hand:\r\nand bind also some of the herb (if you will) to the place, and, with\r\nGod’s blessing, it will help it in three times dressing.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHICK-PEASE, OR CICERS.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THE garden sorts whether red, black, or white, bring\r\nforth stalks a yard long, whereon do grow many small and almost round\r\nleaves, dented about the edges, set on both sides of a middle rib;\r\nAt the joints come forth one or two flowers, upon sharp foot stalks,\r\npease-fashion, either white or whitish, or purplish red, lighter or\r\ndeeper, according as the pease that follow will be, that are contained\r\nin small, thick, and short pods, wherein lie one or two pease, more\r\nusually pointed at the lower end, and almost round at the head, yet a\r\nlittle cornered or sharp; the root is small, and perishes yearly.\r\n\r\n_Place and Time._] They are sown in gardens, or fields as pease, being\r\nsown later than pease, and gathered at the same time with them, or\r\npresently after.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] They are both under the dominion of Venus.\r\nThey are less windy than beans, but nourish more; they provoke urine,\r\nand are thought to increase sperm; they have a cleansing faculty,\r\nwhereby they break the stone in the kidneys. To drink the cream of\r\nthem, being boiled in water, is the best way. It moves the belly\r\ndownwards, provokes women’s courses and urine, increases both milk and\r\nseed. One ounce of Cicers, two ounces of French barley, and a small\r\nhandful of Marsh-mallow roots, clean washed and cut, being boiled in\r\nthe broth of a chicken, and four ounces taken in the morning, and\r\nfasting two hours after, is a good medicine for a pain in the sides.\r\nThe white Cicers are used more for meat than medicine, yet have the\r\nsame effect, and are thought more powerful to increase milk and seed.\r\nThe wild Cicers are so much more powerful than the garden kinds, by\r\nhow much they exceed them in heat and dryness; whereby they do more\r\nopen obstructions, break the stone, and have all the properties of\r\ncutting, opening, digesting, and dissolving; and this more speedily and\r\ncertainly than the former.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CINQUEFOIL, OR FIVE-LEAVED GRASS; CALLED IN SOME COUNTIES,\r\n    FIVE-FINGERED GRASS.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] IT spreads and creeps far upon the ground, with long\r\nslender strings like straw berries, which take root again, and shoot\r\nforth many leaves, made of five parts, and sometimes of seven, dented\r\nabout the edges, and somewhat hard. The stalks are slender, leaning\r\ndownwards and bear many small yellow flowers thereon, with some yellow\r\nthreads in the middle, standing about a smooth green head, which, when\r\nit is ripe, is a little rough, and contains small brownish seeds. The\r\nroot is of a blackish brown colour, as big as one’s little finger, but\r\ngrowing long, with some threads thereat; and by the small string it\r\nquickly spreads over the ground.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows by wood sides, hedge sides, the path-way in fields,\r\nand in the borders and corners of them almost through all this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in summer, some sooner, some later.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] This is an herb of Jupiter, and therefore\r\nstrengthens the part of the body it rules; let Jupiter be angular and\r\nstrong when it is gathered; and if you give but a scruple (which is but\r\ntwenty grains,) of it at a time, either in white wine, or in white wine\r\nvinegar, you shall very seldom miss the cure of an ague, be it what\r\nague soever, in three fits, as I have often proved to the admiration\r\nboth of myself and others; let no man despise it because it is plain\r\nand easy, the ways of God are all such. It is an especial herb used in\r\nall inflammations and fevers, whether infectious or pestilential; or\r\namong other herbs to cool and temper the blood and humours in the body.\r\nAs also for all lotions, gargles, infections, and the like, for sore\r\nmouths, ulcers, cancers, fistulas, and other corrupt, foul, or running\r\nsores. The juice hereof drank, about four ounces at a time, for certain\r\ndays together, cures the quinsey and yellow jaundice; and taken for\r\nthirty days together, cures the falling sickness. The roots boiled in\r\nmilk, and drank, is a most effectual remedy for all fluxes in man or\r\nwoman, whether the white or red, as also the bloody flux. The roots\r\nboiled in vinegar, and the decoction thereof held in the mouth, eases\r\nthe pains of the toothach. The juice or decoction taken with a little\r\nhoney, helps the hoarseness of the throat, and is very good for the\r\ncough of the lungs. The distilled water of both roots and leaves, is\r\nalso effectual to all the purposes aforesaid; and if the hands be often\r\nwashed therein, and suffered at every time to dry in of itself without\r\nwiping, it will in a short time help the palsy, or shaking in them.\r\nThe root boiled in vinegar, helps all knots, kernels, hard swellings,\r\nand lumps growing in any part of the flesh, being thereto applied;\r\nas also inflammations, and St. Anthony’s fire, all imposthumes, and\r\npainful sores with heat and putrefaction, the shingles also, and all\r\nother sorts of running and foul scabs, sores and itch. The same also\r\nboiled in wine, and applied to any joint full of pain, ache, or the\r\ngout in the hands or feet, or the hip gout, called the Sciatica, and\r\nthe decoction thereof drank the while, doth cure them, and eases much\r\npain in the bowels. The roots are likewise effectual to help ruptures\r\nor bursting, being used with other things available to that purpose,\r\ntaken either inwardly or outwardly, or both; as also bruises or hurts\r\nby blows, falls, or the like, and to stay the bleeding of wounds in any\r\nparts inward or outward.\r\n\r\nSome hold that one leaf cures a quotidian, three a tertain, and four a\r\nquartan ague, and a hundred to one if it be not Dioscorides; for he is\r\nfull of whimsies. The truth is, I never stood so much upon the number\r\nof the leaves, nor whether I give it in powder or decoction: If Jupiter\r\nwere strong, and the Moon applying to him, or his good aspect at the\r\ngathering, I never knew it miss the desired effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CIVES.\r\n\r\nCALLED also Rush Leeks, Chives, Civet, and Sweth.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] I confess I had not added these, had it\r\nnot been for a country gentleman, who by a letter certified me, that\r\namongst other herbs, I had left these out; they are indeed a kind of\r\nleeks, hot and dry in the fourth degree as they are, and so under the\r\ndominion of Mars; If they be eaten raw, (I do not mean raw, opposite\r\nto roasted or boiled, but raw, opposite to chymical preparation) they\r\nsend up very hurtful vapours to the brain, causing troublesome sleep,\r\nand spoiling the eye-sight, yet of them prepared by the art of the\r\nalchymist, may be made an excellent remedy for the stoppage of the\r\nurine.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CLARY, OR MORE PROPERLY CLEAR-EYE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] OUR ordinary garden Clary has four square stalks, with\r\nbroad, rough, wrinkled, whitish, or hoary green leaves somewhat evenly\r\ncut in on the edges, and of a strong sweet scent, growing some near the\r\nground, and some by couples upon stalks. The flowers grow at certain\r\ndistances, with two small leaves at the joints under them, somewhat\r\nlike unto the flowers of Sage, but smaller, and of a whitish blue\r\ncolour. The seed is brownish, and somewhat flat, or not so round as the\r\nwild. The roots are blackish, and spread not far, and perish after the\r\nseed time. It is usually sown, for it seldom rises of its own sowing.\r\n\r\n_Place._] This grows in gardens.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in June and July, some a little later than others,\r\nand their seed is ripe in August, or thereabouts.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of the Moon. The\r\nseed put into the eyes clears them from motes, and such like things\r\ngotten within the lids to offend them, as also clears them from white\r\nand red spots on them. The mucilage of the seed made with water, and\r\napplied to tumours, or swellings, disperses and takes them away; as\r\nalso draws forth splinters, thorns, or other things gotten into the\r\nflesh. The leaves used with vinegar, either by itself, or with a\r\nlittle honey, doth help boils, felons, and the hot inflammation that\r\nare gathered by their pains, if applied before it be grown too great.\r\nThe powder of the dried root put into the nose, provokes sneezing, and\r\nthereby purges the head and brain of much rheum and corruption. The\r\nseed or leaves taken in wine, provokes to venery. It is of much use\r\nboth for men and women that have weak backs, and helps to strengthen\r\nthe reins: used either by itself, or with other herbs conducing to the\r\nsame effect, and in tansies often. The fresh leaves dipped in a batter\r\nof flour, eggs, and a little milk, and fried in butter, and served to\r\nthe table, is not unpleasant to any, but exceedingly profitable for\r\nthose that are troubled with weak backs, and the effects thereof. The\r\njuice of the herb put into ale or beer, and drank, brings down women’s\r\ncourses, and expels the after-birth.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILD CLARY.\r\n\r\nWILD Clary is most blasphemously called Christ’s Eye, because it cures\r\ndiseases of the eye. I could wish for my soul, blasphemy, ignorance,\r\nand tyranny, were ceased among physicians, that they may be happy, and\r\nI joyful.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] It is like the other Clary, but lesser, with many stalks\r\nabout a foot and a half high. The stalks are square, and somewhat\r\nhairy; the flowers of a bluish colour; He that knows the common Clary\r\ncannot be ignorant of this.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows commonly in this nation in barren places; you may\r\nfind it plentifully, if you look in the fields near Gray’s Inn, and\r\nnear Chelsea.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower from the beginning of June to the latter end of\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is something hotter and drier than the\r\ngarden Clary is, yet nevertheless under the dominion of the Moon, as\r\nwell as that; the seeds of it being beat to powder, and drank with\r\nwine, is an admirable help to provoke lust. A decoction of the leaves\r\nbeing drank, warms the stomach, and it is a wonder if it should not,\r\nthe stomach being under Cancer, the house of the Moon. Also it helps\r\ndigestion, scatters congealed blood in any part of the body. The\r\ndistilled water hereof cleanses the eyes of redness, waterishness\r\nand heat: It is a gallant remedy for dimness of sight, to take one\r\nof the seeds of it, and put into the eyes, and there let it remain\r\ntill it drops out of itself, (the pain will be nothing to speak on,)\r\nit will cleanse the eyes of all filthy and putrified matter; and in\r\noften repeating it, will take off a film which covers the sight: a\r\nhandsomer, safer, and easier remedy by a great deal, than to tear it\r\noff with a needle.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CLEAVERS.\r\n\r\nIT is also called Aperine, Goose-shade, Goose-grass, and Cleavers.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The common Cleavers have divers very rough square stalks,\r\nnot so big as the top of a point, but rising up to be two or three\r\nyards high sometimes, if it meet with any tall bushes or trees whereon\r\nit may climb, yet without any claspers, or else much lower, and lying\r\non the ground, full of joints, and at every one of them shoots forth\r\na branch, besides the leaves thereat, which are usually six, set in\r\na round compass like a star, or a rowel of a spur: From between the\r\nleaves or the joints towards the tops of the branches, come forth very\r\nsmall white flowers, at every end upon small thready foot-stalks, which\r\nafter they have fallen, there do shew two small round and rough seeds\r\njoined together which, when they are ripe, grow hard and whitish,\r\nhaving a little hole on the side, something like unto a navel. Both\r\nstalks, leaves, and seeds are so rough, that they will cleave to any\r\nthing that will touch them. The root is small and thready spreading\r\nmuch to the ground, but die every year.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows by the hedge and ditch-sides in many places of this\r\nland, and is so troublesome an inhabitant in gardens, that it ramps\r\nupon, and is ready to choak what ever grows near it.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in June or July, and the seed is ripe and falls\r\nagain in the end of July or August, from whence it springs up again,\r\nand not from the old roots.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of the Moon. The\r\njuice of the herb and the seed together taken in wine, helps those\r\nbitten with an adder, by preserving the heart from the venom. It is\r\nfamiliarly taken in broth to keep them lean and lank, that are apt\r\nto grow fat. The distilled water drank twice a day, helps the yellow\r\njaundice, and the decoction of the herb, in experience, is found to do\r\nthe same, and stays lasks and bloody-fluxes. The juice of the leaves,\r\nor they a little bruised, and applied to any bleeding wounds, stays the\r\nbleeding. The juice also is very good to close up the lips of green\r\nwounds, and the powder of the dried herb strewed thereupon doth the\r\nsame, and likewise helps old ulcers. Being boiled in hog’s grease,\r\nit helps all sorts of hard swellings or kernels in the throat, being\r\nanointed therewith. The juice dropped into the ears, takes away the\r\npain of them.\r\n\r\nIt is a good remedy in the Spring, eaten (being first chopped small,\r\nand boiled well) in water-gruel, to cleanse the blood, and strengthen\r\nthe liver, thereby to keep the body in health, and fitting it for that\r\nchange of season that is coming.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CLOWN’S WOODS.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] IT grows up sometimes to two or three feet high, but\r\nusually about two feet, with square green rough stalks, but slender,\r\njoined somewhat far asunder, and two very long, somewhat narrow, dark\r\ngreen leaves, bluntly dented about the edges thereof, ending in a long\r\npoint. The flowers stand towards the tops, compassing the stalks at\r\nthe joints with the leaves, and end likewise in a spiked top, having\r\nlong and much gaping hoods of a purplish red colour, with whitish spots\r\nin them, standing in somewhat round husks, wherein afterwards stand\r\nblackish round seeds. The root is composed of many long strings, with\r\nsome tuberous long knobs growing among them, of a pale yellowish or\r\nwhitish colour, yet some times of the year these knobby roots in many\r\nplaces are not seen in this plant. This plant smells somewhat strong.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in sundry counties of this land, both north and\r\nwest, and frequently by path-sides in the fields near about London, and\r\nwithin three or four miles distant about it, yet it usually grows in or\r\nnear ditches.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in June or July, and the seed is ripe soon after.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of the planet\r\nSaturn. It is singularly effectual in all fresh and green wounds, and\r\ntherefore bears not this name for nought. And it is very available in\r\nstaunching of blood and to dry up the fluxes of humours in old fretting\r\nulcers, cankers, &c. that hinder the healing of them.\r\n\r\nA syrup made of the juice of it, is inferior to none for inward wounds,\r\nruptures of veins, bloody flux, vessels broken, spitting, urining,\r\nor vomiting blood: Ruptures are excellent and speedily, ever to\r\nadmiration, cured by taking now and then a little of the syrup, and\r\napplying an ointment or plaister of this herb to the place. Also, if\r\nany vein be swelled or muscle, apply a plaister of this herb to it, and\r\nif you add a little Comfrey to it, it will not be amiss. I assure thee\r\nthe herb deserves commendation, though it has gotten such a clownish\r\nname; and whosoever reads this, (if he try it, as I have done,) will\r\ncommend it; only take notice that it is of a dry earthy quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n    COCK’S HEAD, RED FITCHING, OR MEDICK\r\n    FETCH.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS has divers weak but rough stalks, half a yard long,\r\nleaning downward, but set with winged leaves, longer and more pointed\r\nthan those of Lintels, and whitish underneath; from the tops of these\r\nstalks arise up other slender stalks, naked without leaves unto the\r\ntops, where there grow many small flowers in manner of a spike, of a\r\npale reddish colour with some blueness among them; after which rise up\r\nin their places, round, rough, and somewhat flat heads. The root is\r\ntough, and somewhat woody, yet lives and shoots a-new every year.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows upon hedges, and sometimes in the open fields, in\r\ndivers places of this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower all the months of July and August, and the seed\r\nripen in the mean while.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of Venus. It has\r\npower to rarify and digest, and therefore the green leaves bruised and\r\nlaid as a plaister, disperse knots, nodes, or kernels in the flesh; and\r\nif, when dry, it be taken in wine, it helps the stranguary; and being\r\nanointed with oil, it provokes sweat. It is a singular food for cattle,\r\nto cause them to give store of milk; and why then may it not do the\r\nlike, being boiled in ordinary drink, for nurses.\r\n\r\n\r\n    COLUMBINES.\r\n\r\nTHESE are so well known, growing almost in every garden, that I think I\r\nmay save the expence of time in writing a description of them.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in May, and abide not for the most part when June\r\nis past, perfecting their seed in the mean time.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is also an herb of Venus. The leaves of\r\nColumbines are commonly used in lotions with good success for sore\r\nmouths and throats. Tragus saith, that a dram of the seed taken in wine\r\nwith a little saffron, opens obstructions of the liver, and is good for\r\nthe yellow jaundice, if the party after the taking thereof be laid to\r\nsweat well in bed. The seed also taken in wine causes a speedy delivery\r\nof women in childbirth: if one draught suffice not, let her drink the\r\nsecond, and it will be effectual: The Spaniards used to eat a piece of\r\nthe root thereof in the morning fasting, many days together, to help\r\nthem when troubled with the stone in the reins or kidneys.\r\n\r\n\r\n    COLTSFOOT.\r\n\r\nCALLED also Coughwort, Foal’s-foot, Horse-hoof, and Bull’s-foot.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] This shoots up a slender stalk, with small yellowish\r\nflowers somewhat earlier, which fall away quickly, and after they are\r\npast, come up somewhat round leaves, sometimes dented about the edges,\r\nmuch lesser, thicker, and greener than those of butter-bur, with a\r\nlittle down or frieze over the green leaf on the upper side, which may\r\nbe rubbed away, and whitish or meally underneath. The root is small\r\nand white, spreading much under ground, so that where it takes it will\r\nhardly be driven away again, if any little piece be abiding therein;\r\nand from thence spring fresh leaves.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows as well in wet grounds as in drier places.\r\n\r\n_Time._] And flowers in the end of February, the leaves begin to appear\r\nin March.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The plant is under Venus, the fresh leaves\r\nor juice, or a syrup thereof is good for a hot dry cough, or wheezing,\r\nand shortness of breath. The dry leaves are best for those that have\r\nthin rheums and distillations upon their lungs, causing a cough, for\r\nwhich also the dried leaves taken as tobacco, or the root is very\r\ngood. The distilled water hereof simply, or with Elder flowers and\r\nNightshade, is a singularly good remedy against all hot agues, to drink\r\ntwo ounces at a time, and apply cloths wet therein to the head and\r\nstomach, which also does much good, being applied to any hot swellings\r\nand inflammations: It helps St. Anthony’s fire, and burnings, and is\r\nsingularly good to take away wheals and small pushes that arise through\r\nheat; as also the burning heat of the piles, or privy parts, cloths wet\r\ntherein being thereunto applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n    COMFREY.\r\n\r\nTHIS is a very common but a very neglected plant. It contains very\r\ngreat virtues.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The common Great Comfrey has divers very large hairy green\r\nleaves lying on the ground, so hairy or prickly, that if they touch any\r\ntender parts of the hands, face, or body, it will cause it to itch; the\r\nstalks that rise from among them, being two or three feet high, hollow\r\nand cornered, is very hairy also, having many such like leaves as grow\r\nbelow, but less and less up to the top: At the joints of the stalks it\r\nis divided into many branches, with some leaves thereon, and at the\r\nends stand many flowers in order one above another, which are somewhat\r\nlong and hollow like the finger of a glove, of a pale whitish colour,\r\nafter which come small black seeds. The roots are great and long,\r\nspreading great thick branches under ground, black on the outside,\r\nand whitish within, short and easy to break, and full of glutinous or\r\nclammy juice, of little or no taste at all.\r\n\r\nThere is another sort in all things like this, only somewhat less, and\r\nbears flowers of a pale purple colour.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow by ditches and water-sides, and in divers fields\r\nthat are moist, for therein they chiefly delight to grow. The first\r\ngenerally through all the land, and the other but in some places. By\r\nthe leave of my authors, I know the first grows in dry places.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in June or July, and give their seed in August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] This is an herb of Saturn, and I suppose\r\nunder the sign Capricorn, cold, dry, and earthy in quality. What was\r\nspoken of Clown’s Woundwort may be said of this. The Great Comfrey\r\nhelps those that spit blood, or make a bloody urine. The root boiled\r\nin water or wine, and the decoction drank, helps all inward hurts,\r\nbruises, wounds, and ulcer of the lungs, and causes the phlegm that\r\noppresses them to be easily spit forth: It helps the defluction of\r\nrheum from the head upon the lungs, the fluxes of blood or humours by\r\nthe belly, women’s immoderate courses, as well the reds as the whites,\r\nand the running of the reins happening by what cause soever. A syrup\r\nmade thereof is very effectual for all those inward griefs and hurts,\r\nand the distilled water for the same purpose also, and for outward\r\nwounds and sores in the fleshy or sinewy part of the body whatsoever,\r\nas also to take away the fits of agues, and to allay the sharpness\r\nof humours. A decoction of the leaves hereof is available to all\r\nthe purposes, though not so effectual as the roots. The roots being\r\noutwardly applied, help fresh wounds or cuts immediately, being bruised\r\nand laid thereto; and is special good for ruptures and broken bones;\r\nyea, it is said to be so powerful to consolidate and knit together,\r\nthat if they be boiled with dissevered pieces of flesh in a pot, it\r\nwill join them together again. It is good to be applied to women’s\r\nbreasts that grow sore by the abundance of milk coming into them; also\r\nto repress the over much bleeding of the hæmorrhoids, to cool the\r\ninflammation of the parts thereabouts, and to give ease of pains. The\r\nroots of Comfrey taken fresh, beaten small, and spread upon leather,\r\nand laid upon any place troubled with the gout, doth presently give\r\nease of the pains; and applied in the same manner, gives ease to pained\r\njoints, and profits very much for running and moist ulcers, gangrenes,\r\nmortifications, and the like, for which it hath by often experience\r\nbeen found helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CORALWORT.\r\n\r\nIT is also called by some Toothwort, Tooth Violet, Dog-Teeth Violet,\r\nand Dentaria.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] Of the many sorts of this herb two of them may be found\r\ngrowing in this nation; the first of which shoots forth one or two\r\nwinged leaves, upon long brownish foot-stalks, which are doubled down\r\nat their first coming out of the ground; when they are fully opened\r\nthey consist of seven leaves, most commonly of a sad green colour,\r\ndented about the edges, set on both sides the middle rib one against\r\nanother, as the leaves of the ash tree; the stalk bears no leaves on\r\nthe lower half of it; the upper half bears sometimes three or four,\r\neach consisting of five leaves, sometimes of three; on the top stand\r\nfour or five flowers upon short foot-stalks, with long husks; the\r\nflowers are very like the flowers of Stockgilliflowers, of a pale\r\npurplish colour, consisting of four leaves a-piece, after which come\r\nsmall pods, which contain the seed; the root is very smooth, white and\r\nshining; it does not grow downwards, but creeps along under the upper\r\ncrust of the ground, and consists of divers small round knobs set\r\ntogether; towards the top of the stalk there grows some single leaves,\r\nby each of which comes a small cloven bulb, which when it is ripe, if\r\nit be set in the ground, it will grow to be a root.\r\n\r\nAs for the other Coralwort, which grows in this nation, it is more\r\nscarce than this, being a very small plant, much like Crowfoot,\r\ntherefore some think it to be one of the sorts of Crowfoot. I know not\r\nwhere to direct you to it, therefore I shall forbear the description.\r\n\r\n_Place._] The first grows in Mayfield in Sussex, in a wood called\r\nHighread, and in another wood there also, called Fox-holes.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower from the latter end of April to the middle of May,\r\nand before the middle of July they are gone, and not to be found.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of the Moon. It\r\ncleanses the bladder, and provokes urine, expels gravel, and the stone;\r\nit eases pains in the sides and bowels, is excellently good for inward\r\nwounds, especially such as are made in the breast or lungs, by taking\r\na dram of the powder of the root every morning in wine; the same is\r\nexcellently good for ruptures, as also to stop fluxes; an ointment made\r\nof it is exceedingly good for wounds and ulcers, for it soon dries up\r\nthe watery humours which hinder the cure.\r\n\r\n\r\n    COSTMARY, OR ALCOST, OR BALSAM\r\n    HERB.\r\n\r\nTHIS is so frequently known to be an inhabitant in almost every garden,\r\nthat I suppose it needless to write a description thereof.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in June and July.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of Jupiter. The\r\nordinary Costmary, as well as Maudlin, provokes urine abundantly,\r\nand moistens the hardness of the mother; it gently purges choler\r\nand phlegm, extenuating that which is gross, and cutting that which\r\nis tough and glutinous, cleanses that which is foul, and hinders\r\nputrefaction and corruption; it dissolves without attraction, opens\r\nobstructions, and helps their evil effects, and it is a wonderful\r\nhelp to all sorts of dry agues. It is astringent to the stomach, and\r\nstrengthens the liver, and all the other inward parts; and taken in\r\nwhey works more effectually. Taken fasting in the morning, it is very\r\nprofitable for pains in the head that are continual, and to stay, dry\r\nup, and consume all thin rheums or distillations from the head into\r\nthe stomach, and helps much to digest raw humours that are gathered\r\ntherein. It is very profitable for those that are fallen into a\r\ncontinual evil disposition of the whole body, called Cachexia, but\r\nespecially in the beginning of the disease. It is an especial friend\r\nand helps to evil, weak and cold livers. The seed is familiarly given\r\nto children for the worms, and so is the infusion of the flowers\r\nin white wine given them to the quantity of two ounces at a time;\r\nit makes an excellent salve to cleanse and heal old ulcers, being\r\nboiled with oil of olive, and Adder’s tongue with it, and after it is\r\nstrained, put a little wax, rosin, and turpentine, to bring it to a\r\nconvenient body.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CUDWEED, OR COTTONWEED.\r\n\r\nBESIDES Cudweed and Cottonweed, it is also Called Chaffweed, Dwarf\r\nCotton, and Petty Cotton.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The common Cudweed rises up with one stalk sometimes,\r\nand sometimes with two or three, thick set on all sides with small,\r\nlong and narrow whitish or woody leaves, from the middle of the stalk\r\nalmost up to the top, with every leaf stands small flowers of a dun or\r\nbrownish yellow colour, or not so yellow as others; in which herbs,\r\nafter the flowers are fallen, come small seed wrapped up, with the\r\ndown therein, and is carried away with the wind; the root is small and\r\nthready.\r\n\r\nThere are other sorts hereof, which are somewhat less than the former,\r\nnot much different, save only that the stalks and leaves are shorter,\r\nso that the flowers are paler and more open.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow in dry, barren, sandy, and gravelly grounds, in\r\nmost places of this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower about July, some earlier, some later, and their\r\nseed is ripe in August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Venus is Lady of it. The plants are\r\nall astringent, binding, or drying, and therefore profitable for\r\ndefluctions of rheum from the head, and to stay fluxes of blood\r\nwheresoever, the decoction being made into red wine and drank, or the\r\npowder taken therein. It also helps the bloody-flux, and eases the\r\ntorments that come thereby, stays the immoderate courses of women,\r\nand is also good for inward or outward wounds, hurts, and bruises,\r\nand helps children both of bursting and the worms, and being either\r\ndrank or injected, for the disease called Tenesmus, which is an often\r\nprovocation to the stool without doing any thing. The green leaves\r\nbruised, and laid to any green wound, stays the bleeding, and heals it\r\nup quickly. The juice of the herb taken in wine and milk, is, as Pliny\r\nsaith, a sovereign remedy against the mumps and quinsey; and further\r\nsaith, That whosoever shall so take it, shall never be troubled with\r\nthat disease again.\r\n\r\n\r\n    COWSLIPS, OR PEAGLES.\r\n\r\nBOTH the wild and garden Cowslips are so well known, that I neither\r\ntrouble myself nor the reader with a description of them.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in April and May.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Venus lays claim to this herb as her own,\r\nand it is under the sign Aries, and our city dames know well enough the\r\nointment or distilled water of it adds beauty, or at least restores it\r\nwhen it is lost. The flowers are held to be more effectual than the\r\nleaves, and the roots of little use. An ointment being made with them,\r\ntakes away spots and wrinkles of the skin, sun-burning, and freckles,\r\nand adds beauty exceedingly; they remedy all infirmities of the head\r\ncoming of heat and wind, as vertigo, ephialtes, false apparitions,\r\nphrensies, falling-sickness, palsies, convulsions, cramps, pains in\r\nthe nerves; the roots ease pains in the back and bladder, and open the\r\npassages of urine. The leaves are good in wounds, and the flowers take\r\naway trembling. If the flowers be not well dried, and kept in a warm\r\nplace, they will soon putrefy and look green: Have a special eye over\r\nthem; If you let them see the Sun once a month, it will do neither the\r\nSun nor them harm.\r\n\r\nBecause they strengthen the brain and nerves, and remedy palsies,\r\nGreeks gave them the name Paralysis. The flowers preserved or\r\nconserved, and the quantity of a nutmeg eaten every morning, is a\r\nsufficient dose for inward diseases; but for wounds, spots, wrinkles,\r\nand sunburnings, an ointment is made of the leaves, and hog’s grease.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CRAB’S CLAWS.\r\n\r\nCALLED also Water Sengreen, Knight’s Pond Water, Water House-leek, Pond\r\nWeed, and Fresh-water Soldier.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] It has sundry long narrow leaves, with sharp prickles\r\non the edges of them, also very sharp pointed; the stalks which bear\r\nflowers, seldom grow so high as the leaves, bearing a forked head, like\r\na Crab’s Claw, out of which comes a white flower, consisting of three\r\nleaves, with divers yellowish hairy threads in the middle; it takes\r\nroot in the mud at the bottom of the water.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows plentifully in the fens in Lincolnshire.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in June, and usually from thence till August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a plant under the dominion of Venus,\r\nand therefore a great strengthener of the reins; it is excellently\r\ngood for inflammation which is commonly called St. Anthony’s Fire; it\r\nassuages inflammations, and swellings in wounds: and an ointment made\r\nof it is excellently good to heal them; there is scarcely a better\r\nremedy growing than this is, for such as have bruised their kidneys,\r\nand upon that account discharge blood; a dram of the powder of the herb\r\ntaken every morning, is a very good remedy to stop the terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BLACK CRESSES.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] IT has long leaves, deeply cut and jagged on both sides,\r\nnot much unlike wild mustard; the stalk small, very limber, though very\r\ntough: you may twist them round as you may a willow before they break.\r\nThe flowers are very small and yellow, after which comes small pods,\r\nwhich contains the seed.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It is a common herb, grows usually by the way-side, and\r\nsometimes upon mud walls about London, but it delights to grow most\r\namong stones and rubbish.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in June and July, and the seed is ripe in August\r\nand September.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a plant of a hot and biting nature,\r\nunder the dominion of Mars. The seed of Black Cresses strengthens the\r\nbrain exceedingly, being, in performing that office, little inferior\r\nto mustard seed, if at all; they are excellently good to stay those\r\nrheums which may fall down from the head upon the lungs; you may beat\r\nthe seed into powder, if you please, and make it up into an electuary\r\nwith honey; so you have an excellent remedy by you, not only for the\r\npremises, but also for the cough, yellow jaundice and sciatica. This\r\nherb boiled into a poultice, is an excellent remedy for inflammations;\r\nboth in women’s breast, and men’s testicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SCIATICA CRESSES.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THESE are of two kinds; The first rises up with a round\r\nstalk about two feet high, spreads into divers branches, whose lower\r\nleaves are somewhat larger than the upper, yet all of them cut or\r\ntorn on the edges, somewhat like the garden Cresses, but smaller, the\r\nflowers are small and white, growing at the tops of branches, where\r\nafterwards grow husks with small brownish seeds therein very strong and\r\nsharp in taste, more than the Cresses of the garden; the root is long,\r\nwhite, and woody.\r\n\r\nThe other has the lower leaves whole somewhat long and broad, not torn\r\nat all, but only somewhat deeply dented about the edges towards the\r\nends; but those that grow up higher are smaller. The flowers and seeds\r\nare like the former, and so is the root likewise, and both root and\r\nseeds as sharp as it.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow in the way-sides in untilled places, and by the\r\nsides of old walls.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in the end of June, and their seed is ripe in July.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a Saturnine plant. The leaves, but\r\nespecially the root, taken fresh in Summer-time, beaten or made into\r\na poultice or salve with old hog’s grease, and applied to the places\r\npained with the sciatica, to continue thereon four hours if it be on a\r\nman, and two hours on a woman; the place afterwards bathed with wine\r\nand oil mixed together, and then wrapped with wool or skins, after they\r\nhave sweat a little, will assuredly cure not only the same disease in\r\nhips, knuckle-bone, or other of the joints, as gout in the hands or\r\nfeet, but all other old griefs of the head, (as inveterate rheums,)\r\nand other parts of the body that are hard to be cured. And if of the\r\nformer griefs any parts remain, the same medicine after twenty days,\r\nis to be applied again. The same is also effectual in the diseases of\r\nthe spleen; and applied to the skin, takes away the blemish thereof,\r\nwhether they be scars, leprosy, scabs, or scurf, which although it\r\nulcerate the part, yet that is to be helped afterwards with a salve\r\nmade of oil and wax. Esteem this as another secret.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WATER CRESSES.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] OUR ordinary Water Cresses spread forth with many weak,\r\nhollow, sappy stalks, shooting out fibres at the joints and upwards\r\nlong winged leaves made of sundry broad sappy almost round leaves, of\r\na brownish colour. The flowers are many and white standing on long\r\nfoot-stalks after which come small yellow seed, contained in small long\r\npods like horns. The whole plant abides green in the winter, and tastes\r\nsomewhat hot and sharp.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow, for the most part, in small standing waters, yet\r\nsometimes in small rivulets of running water.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower and seed in the beginning of Summer.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb under the dominion of the\r\nMoon. They are more powerful against the scurvy, and to cleanse the\r\nblood and humours, than Brooklime is, and serve in all the other uses\r\nin which Brooklime is available, as to break the stone, and provoke\r\nurine and woman’s courses. The decoction thereof cleanses ulcers, by\r\nwashing them therewith. The leaves bruised, or the juice, is good, to\r\nbe applied to the face or other parts troubled with freckles, pimples,\r\nspots, or the like, at night, and washed away in the morning. The juice\r\nmixed with vinegar, and the fore part of the head bathed therewith, is\r\nvery good for those that are dull and drowsy, or have the lethargy.\r\n\r\nWater-cress pottage is a good remedy to cleanse the blood in the\r\nspring, and help headaches, and consume the gross humours winter has\r\nleft behind; those that would live in health, may use it if they\r\nplease; if they will not, I cannot help it. If any fancy not pottage,\r\nthey may eat the herb as a sallad.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CROSSWORT.\r\n\r\nTHIS herb receives its name from the situation of its leaves.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] Common Crosswort grows up with square hairy brown stalks\r\na little above a foot high, having four small broad and pointed, hairy\r\nyet smooth thin leaves, growing at every joint, each against other one\r\nway, which has caused the name. Towards the tops of the stalks at the\r\njoints, with the leaves in three or four rows downwards, stand small,\r\npale yellow flowers, after which come small blackish round seeds, four\r\nfor the most part, set in every husk. The root is very small, and full\r\nof fibres, or threads, taking good hold of the ground, and spreading\r\nwith the branches over a great deal of ground, which perish not in\r\nwinter, although the leaves die every year and spring again anew.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in many moist grounds, well in meadows as untilled\r\nplaces, about London, in Hampstead church-yard, at Wye in Kent, and\r\nsundry other places.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers from May all the Summer long, in one place or\r\nother, as they are more open to the sun; the seed ripens soon after.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of Saturn. This is\r\na singularly good wound herb, and is used inwardly, not only to stay\r\nbleeding of wounds, but to consolidate them, as it doth outwardly any\r\ngreen wound, which it quickly solders up, and heals. The decoction of\r\nthe herb in wine, helps to expectorate the phlegm out of the chest,\r\nand is good for obstructions in the breast, stomach, or bowels, and\r\nhelps a decayed appetite. It is also good to wash any wound or sore\r\nwith, to cleanse and heal it. The herb bruised, and then boiled applied\r\noutwardly for certain days together, renewing it often: and in the mean\r\ntime the decoction of the herb in wine, taken inwardly every day, doth\r\ncertainly cure the rupture in any, so as it be not too inveterate; but\r\nvery speedily, if it be fresh and lately taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CROWFOOT.\r\n\r\nMANY are the names this furious biting herb has obtained, almost enough\r\nto make up a Welchman’s pedigree, if he fetch no farther than John of\r\nGaunt, or William the Conquerer; for it is called Frog’s-foot, from the\r\nGreek name Barrakion: Crowfoot, Gold Knobs, Gold Cups, King’s Knob,\r\nBaffiners, Troilflowers, Polts, Locket Gouions, and Butterflowers.\r\n\r\nAbundance are the sorts of this herb, that to describe them all would\r\ntire the patience of Socrates himself, but because I have not yet\r\nattained to the spirit of Socrates, I shall but describe the most usual.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The most common Crowfoot has many thin great leaves, cut\r\ninto divers parts, in taste biting and sharp, biting and blistering\r\nthe tongue: It bears many flowers, and those of a bright, resplendent,\r\nyellow colour. I do not remember, that I ever saw any thing yellower.\r\nVirgins, in ancient time, used to make powder of them to furrow bride\r\nbeds; after which flowers come small heads, some spiked and rugged like\r\na Pine-Apple.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow very common every where; unless you turn your head\r\ninto a hedge you cannot but see them as you walk.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in May and June, even till September.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] This fiery and hot-spirited herb of Mars\r\nis no way fit to be given inwardly, but an ointment of the leaves or\r\nflowers will draw a blister, and may be so fitly applied to the nape of\r\nthe neck to draw back rheum from the eyes. The herb being bruised and\r\nmixed with a little mustard, draws a blister as well, and as perfectly\r\nas Cantharides, and with far less danger to the vessels of urine, which\r\nCantharides naturally delight to wrong; I knew the herb once applied\r\nto a pestilential rising that was fallen down, and it saved life even\r\nbeyond hope; it were good to keep an ointment and plaister of it, if it\r\nwere but for that.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CUCKOW-POINT.\r\n\r\nIT is called Aron, Janus, Barba-aron, Calve’s-foot, Ramp, Starchwort,\r\nCuckow-point, and Wake Robin.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] This shoots forth three, four or five leaves at the most,\r\nfrom one root, every one whereof is somewhat large and long, broad at\r\nthe bottom next the stalk, and forked, but ending in a point, without\r\na cut on the edge, of a full green colour, each standing upon a thick\r\nround stalk, of a hand-breadth long, or more, among which, after two\r\nor three months that they begin to wither, rises up a bare, round,\r\nwhitish green stalk, spotted and streaked with purple, somewhat higher\r\nthan the leaves: At the top whereof stands a long hollow husk close at\r\nthe bottom, but open from the middle upwards, ending in a point: in\r\nthe middle whereof stands the small long pestle or clapper, smaller at\r\nthe bottom than at the top, of a dark purple colour, as the husk is on\r\nthe inside, though green without; which, after it hath so abided for\r\nsome time, the husk with the clapper decays, and the foot or bottom\r\nthereof grows to be a small long bunch of berries, green at the first,\r\nand of a yellowish red colour when they are ripe, of the bigness of a\r\nhazel-nut kernel, which abides thereon almost until Winter; the root\r\nis round, and somewhat long, for the most part lying along, the leaves\r\nshooting forth at the largest end, which, when it bears its berries,\r\nare somewhat wrinkled and loose, another growing under it, which is\r\nsolid and firm, with many small threads hanging thereat. The whole\r\nplant is of a very sharp biting taste, pricking the tongue as nettles\r\ndo the hands, and so abides for a great while without alteration. The\r\nroot thereof was anciently used instead of starch to starch linen with.\r\n\r\nThere is another sort of Cuckow-point, with less leaves than the\r\nformer, and some times harder, having blackish spots upon them, which\r\nfor the most part abide longer green in Summer than the former, and\r\nboth leaves and roots are more sharp and fierce than it: In all things\r\nelse it is like the former.\r\n\r\n_Place._] These two sorts grow frequently almost under every hedge-side\r\nin many places of this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They shoot forth leaves in the Spring, and continue but until\r\nthe middle of Summer, or somewhat later; their husks appearing before\r\nthe fall away, and their fruit shewing in April.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of Mars. Tragus\r\nreports, that a dram weight, or more, if need be, of the spotted Wake\r\nRobin, either fresh and green, or dried, having been eaten and taken,\r\nis a present and sure remedy for poison and the plague. The juice of\r\nthe herb taken to the quantity of a spoonful has the same effect. But\r\nif there be a little vinegar added thereto, as well as to the root\r\naforesaid, it somewhat allays the sharp biting taste thereof upon the\r\ntongue. The green leaves bruised, and laid upon any boil or plague\r\nsore, doth wonderfully help to draw forth the poison: A dram of the\r\npowder of the dried root taken with twice so much sugar in the form of\r\na licking electuary, or the green root, doth wonderfully help those\r\nthat are pursy and short-winded, as also those that have a cough; it\r\nbreaks, digests, and rids away phlegm from the stomach, chest, and\r\nlungs. The milk wherein the root as been boiled is effectual also for\r\nthe same purpose. The said powder taken in wine or other drink, or\r\nthe juice of the berries, or the powder of them, or the wine wherein\r\nthey have been boiled, provokes urine, and brings down women’s courses\r\nand purges them effectually after child-bearing, to bring away the\r\nafter-birth. Taken with sheep’s milk, it heals the inward ulcers of the\r\nbowels. The distilled water thereof is effectual to all the purposes\r\naforesaid. A spoonful taken at a time heals the itch; an ounce or more\r\ntaken a time for some days together, doth help the rupture: The leaves\r\neither green or dry, or the juice of them, doth cleanse all manner of\r\nrotten and filthy ulcers, in what part of the body soever; and heals\r\nthe stinking sores in the nose, called Polypus. The water wherein the\r\nroot has been boiled, dropped into the eyes, cleanses them from any\r\nfilm or skin, cloud or mists, which begin to hinder the sight, and\r\nhelps the watering and redness of them, or when, by some chance, they\r\nbecome black and blue. The root mixed with bean-flour, and applied to\r\nthe throat or jaws that are inflamed, helps them. The juice of the\r\nberries boiled in oil of roses, or beaten into powder mixed with the\r\noil, and dropped into the ears, eases pains in them. The berries or\r\nthe roots beaten with the hot ox-dung, and applied, eases the pains of\r\nthe gout. The leaves and roots boiled in wine with a little oil, and\r\napplied to the piles, or the falling down of the fundament, eases them,\r\nand so doth sitting over the hot fumes thereof. The fresh roots bruised\r\nand distilled with a little milk, yields a most sovereign water to\r\ncleanse the skin from scurf, freckles, spots, or blemishes whatsoever\r\ntherein.\r\n\r\nAuthors have left large commendations of this herb you see, but for my\r\npart, I have neither spoken with Dr. Reason nor Dr. Experience about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CUCUMBERS.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] THERE is no dispute to be made, but that\r\nthey are under the dominion of the Moon, though they are so much cried\r\nout against for their coldness, and if they were but one degree colder\r\nthey would be poison. The best of Galenists hold them to be cold and\r\nmoist in the second degree, and then not so hot as either lettuce or\r\npurslain: They are excellently good for a hot stomach, and hot liver;\r\nthe unmeasurable use of them fills the body full of raw humours, and so\r\nindeed the unmeasurable use of any thing else doth harm. The face being\r\nwashed with their juice, cleanses the skin, and is excellently good for\r\nhot rheums in the eyes; the seed is excellently good to provoke urine,\r\nand cleanses the passages thereof when they are stopped: there is not\r\na better remedy for ulcers in the bladder growing, than Cucumbers\r\nare; The usual course is, to use the seeds in emulsions, as they make\r\nalmond milk; but a far better way (in my opinion) is this; When the\r\nseason of the year is, take the Cucumbers and bruise them well, and\r\ndistil the water from them, and let such as are troubled with ulcers in\r\nthe bladder drink no other drink. The face being washed with the same\r\nwater, cures the reddest face that is; it is also excellently good for\r\nsun-burning, freckles, and morphew.\r\n\r\n\r\n    DAISIES.\r\n\r\nTHESE are so well known almost to every child, that I suppose it\r\nneedless to write any description of them. Take therefore the virtues\r\nof them as follows.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The herb is under the sign Cancer, and under\r\nthe dominion of Venus, and therefore excellently good for wounds in\r\nthe breast, and very fitting to be kept both in oils, ointments, and\r\nplaisters, as also in syrup. The greater wild Daisy is a wound herb of\r\ngood respect, often used in those drinks or salves that are for wounds,\r\neither inward or outward. The juice or distilled water of these, or\r\nthe small Daisy, doth much temper the heat of choler, and refresh the\r\nliver, and the other inward parts. A decoction made of them and drank,\r\nhelps to cure the wounds made in the hollowness of the breast. The same\r\nalso cures all ulcers and pustules in the mouth or tongue, or in the\r\nsecret parts. The leaves bruised and applied to the privities, or to\r\nany other parts that are swoln and hot, doth dissolve it, and temper\r\nthe heat. A decoction made thereof, of Wallwort and Agrimony, and the\r\nplaces fomented and bathed therewith warm, gives great ease to them\r\nthat are troubled with the palsy, sciatica, or the gout. The same also\r\ndisperses and dissolves the knots or kernels that grow in the flesh of\r\nany part of the body, and bruises and hurts that come of falls and\r\nblows; they are also used for ruptures, and other inward burnings,\r\nwith very good success. An ointment made thereof doth wonderfully help\r\nall wounds that have inflammations about them, or by reason of moist\r\nhumours having access unto them, are kept long from healing, and such\r\nare those, for the most part, that happen to joints of the arms or\r\nlegs. The juice of them dropped into the running eyes of any, doth much\r\nhelp them.\r\n\r\n\r\n    DANDELION, VULGARLY CALLED PISS-A-BEDS.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] IT is well known to have many long and deep gashed leaves,\r\nlying on the ground round about the head of the roots; the ends of each\r\ngash or jag, on both sides looking downwards towards the roots; the\r\nmiddle rib being white, which being broken, yields abundance of bitter\r\nmilk, but the root much more; from among the leaves, which always abide\r\ngreen, arise many slender, weak, naked foot-stalks, every one of them\r\nbearing at the top one large yellow flower, consisting of many rows\r\nof yellow leaves, broad at the points, and nicked in with deep spots\r\nof yellow in the middle, which growing ripe, the green husk wherein\r\nthe flowers stood turns itself down to the stalk, and the head of down\r\nbecomes as round as a ball: with long seed underneath, bearing a part\r\nof the down on the head of every one, which together is blown away\r\nwith the wind, or may be at once blown away with one’s mouth. The root\r\ngrowing downwards exceedingly deep, which being broken off within the\r\nground, will yet shoot forth again, and will hardly be destroyed where\r\nit hath once taken deep root in the ground.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows frequently in all meadows and pasture-grounds.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in one place or other almost all the year long.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of Jupiter. It\r\nis of an opening and cleansing quality, and therefore very effectual\r\nfor the obstructions of the liver, gall and spleen, and the diseases\r\nthat arise from them, as the jaundice and hypocondriac; it opens the\r\npassages of the urine both in young and old; powerfully cleanses\r\nimposthumes and inward ulcers in the urinary passage, and by its drying\r\nand temperate quality doth afterwards heal them; for which purpose the\r\ndecoction of the roots or leaves in white wine, or the leaves chopped\r\nas pot-herbs, with a few Alisanders, and boiled in their broth, are\r\nvery effectual. And whoever is drawing towards a consumption or an\r\nevil disposition of the whole body, called Cachexia, by the use hereof\r\nfor some time together, shall find a wonderful help. It helps also to\r\nprocure rest and sleep to bodies distempered by the heat of ague fits,\r\nor otherwise: The distilled water is effectual to drink in pestilential\r\nfevers, and to wash the sores.\r\n\r\nYou see here what virtues this common herb hath, and that is the\r\nreason the French and Dutch so often eat them in the Spring; and now\r\nif you look a little farther, you may see plainly without a pair of\r\nspectacles, that foreign physicians are not so selfish as ours are, but\r\nmore communicative of the virtues of plants to people.\r\n\r\n\r\n    DARNEL.\r\n\r\nIT is called Jam and Wray: in Sussex they call it Crop, it being a\r\npestilent enemy among corn.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] This has all the winter long sundry long, flat, and rough\r\nleaves, which, when the stalk rises, which is slender and jointed, are\r\nnarrower, but rough still; on the top grows a long spike, composed of\r\nmany heads set one above another, containing two or three husks, with\r\na sharp but short beard of awns at the end; the seed is easily shaken\r\nout of the ear, the husk itself being somewhat rough.\r\n\r\n_Place._] The country husbandmen do know this too well to grow among\r\ntheir corn, or in the borders and pathways of the other fields that are\r\nfallow.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a malicious part of sullen Saturn. As\r\nit is not without some vices, so hath it also many virtues. The meal\r\nof Darnel is very good to stay gangrenes, and other such like fretting\r\nand eating cankers, and putrid sores: It also cleanses the skin of all\r\nleprosies, morphews, ringworms, and the like, if it be used with salt\r\nand raddish roots. And being used with quick brimstone and vinegar,\r\nit dissolves knots and kernels, and breaks those that are hard to be\r\ndissolved, being boiled in wine with pigeon’s dung and Linseed: A\r\ndecoction thereof made with water and honey, and the places bathed\r\ntherewith, is profitable for the sciatica. Darnel meal applied in a\r\npoultice draws forth splinters and broken bones in the flesh: The red\r\nDarnel, boiled in red wine and taken, stays the lask and all other\r\nfluxes, and women’s bloody issues; and restrains urine that passes away\r\ntoo suddenly.\r\n\r\n\r\n    DILL.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THE common Dill grows up with seldom more than one stalk,\r\nneither so high, nor so great usually as Fennel, being round and fewer\r\njoints thereon, whose leaves are sadder, and somewhat long, and so like\r\nFennel that it deceives many, but harder in handling, and somewhat\r\nthicker, and of a strong unpleasant scent: The tops of the stalks have\r\nfour branches and smaller umbels of yellow flowers, which turn into\r\nsmall seed, somewhat flatter and thinner than Fennel seed. The root is\r\nsomewhat small and woody, perishes every year after it hath borne seed:\r\nand is also unprofitable, being never put to any use.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It is most usually sown in gardens and grounds for the\r\npurpose, and is also found wild in many places.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Mercury has the dominion of this plant, and\r\ntherefore to be sure it strengthens the brain. The Dill being boiled\r\nand drank, is good to ease swellings and pains; it also stays the belly\r\nand stomach from casting. The decoction therefore helps women that\r\nare troubled with the pains and windiness of the mother, if they sit\r\ntherein. It stays the hiccough, being boiled in wine, and but smelled\r\nunto being tied in a cloth. The seed is of more use than the leaves,\r\nand more effectual to digest raw and vicious humours, and is used in\r\nmedicines that serve to expel wind, and the pains proceeding therefrom.\r\nThe seed, being roasted or fried, and used in oils or plasters,\r\ndissolve the imposthumes in the fundament; and dries up all moist\r\nulcers, especially in the fundament; an oil made of Dill is effectual\r\nto warm or dissolve humours and imposthumes, and the pains, and to\r\nprocure rest. The decoction of Dill, be it herb or seed (only if you\r\nboil the seed you must bruise it) in white wine, being drank, it is a\r\ngallant expeller of wind, and provoker of the terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n    DEVIL’S-BIT.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS rises up with a round green smooth stalk, about two\r\nfeet high, set with divers long and somewhat narrow, smooth, dark green\r\nleaves, somewhat nipped about the edges, for the most part, being else\r\nall whole, and not divided at all, or but very seldom, even to the\r\ntops of the branches, which yet are smaller than those below, with\r\none rib only in the middle. At the end of each branch stands a round\r\nhead of many flowers set together in the same manner, or more neatly\r\nthan Scabions, and of a bluish purple colour, which being past, there\r\nfollows seed which falls away. The root is somewhat thick, but short\r\nand blackish, with many strings, abiding after seed time many years.\r\nThis root was longer, until the devil (as the friars say) bit away the\r\nrest of it for spite, envying its usefulness to mankind; for sure he\r\nwas not troubled with any disease for which it is proper.\r\n\r\nThere are two other sorts hereof, in nothing unlike the former, save\r\nthat the one bears white, and the other bluish-coloured flowers.\r\n\r\n_Place._] The first grows as well in dry meadows and fields as moist,\r\nin many places of this land: But the other two are more rare, and hard\r\nto be met with, yet they are both found growing wild about Appledore,\r\nnear Rye in Kent.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower not usually until August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The plant is venereal, pleasing, and\r\nharmless. The herb or the root (all that the devil hath left of it)\r\nbeing boiled in wine, and drank, is very powerful against the plague,\r\nand all pestilential diseases or fevers, poisons also, and the bitings\r\nof venemous beasts: It helps also those that are inwardly bruised by\r\nany casuality, or outwardly by falls or blows, dissolving the clotted\r\nblood; and the herb or root beaten and outwardly applied, takes away\r\nthe black and blue marks that remain in the skin. The decoction of\r\nthe herb, with honey of roses put therein, is very effectual to help\r\nthe inveterate tumours and swellings of the almonds and throat, by\r\noften gargling the mouth therewith. It helps also to procure women’s\r\ncourses, and eases all pains of the mother and to break and discuss\r\nwind therein, and in the bowels. The powder of the root taken in drink,\r\ndrives forth the worms in the body. The juice or distilled water of\r\nthe herb, is effectual for green wounds, or old sores, and cleanses\r\nthe body inwardly, and the seed outwardly, from sores, scurf, itch,\r\npimples, freckles, morphew, or other deformities thereof, especially\r\nif a little vitriol be dissolved therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n    DOCK.\r\n\r\nMANY kinds of these are so well known, that I shall not trouble you\r\nwith a description of them: My book grows big too fast.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] All Docks are under Jupiter, of which the\r\nRed Dock, which is commonly called Bloodwort, cleanses the blood, and\r\nstrengthens the liver; but the yellow Dock-root is best to be taken\r\nwhen either the blood or liver is affected by choler. All of them\r\nhave a kind of cooling (but not all alike) drying quality, the sorrel\r\nbeing most cold, and the Blood-worts most drying. Of the Burdock, I\r\nhave spoken already by itself. The seed of most of the other kinds,\r\nwhether the gardens or fields, do stay lasks and fluxes of all sorts,\r\nthe loathing of the stomach through choler, and is helpful for those\r\nthat spit blood. The roots boiled in vinegar help the itch, scabs, and\r\nbreaking out of the skin, if it be bathed therewith. The distilled\r\nwater of the herb and roots have the same virtue, and cleanses the skin\r\nfrom freckles, morphews, and all other spots and discolourings therein.\r\n\r\nAll Docks being boiled with meat, make it boil the sooner: Besides\r\nBlood-wort is exceeding strengthening to the liver, and procures good\r\nblood, being as wholesome a pot herb as any growing in a garden; yet\r\nsuch is the nicety of our times, forsooth, that women will not put it\r\ninto a pot, because it makes the pottage black; pride and ignorance (a\r\ncouple of monsters in the creation) preferring nicety before health.\r\n\r\n\r\n    DODDER OF THYME, EPITHYMUM, AND\r\n    OTHER DODDERS.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS first from seed gives roots in the ground, which\r\nshoot forth threads or strings, grosser or finer as the property of\r\nthe plant wherein it grows, and the climate doth suffer, creeping\r\nand spreading on that plant whereon it fastens, be it high or low.\r\nThe strings have no leaves at all on them, but wind and interlace\r\nthemselves, so thick upon a small plant, that it takes away all comfort\r\nof the sun from it; and is ready to choak or strangle it. After these\r\nstrings are risen to that height, that they may draw nourishment\r\nfrom that plant, they seem to be broken off from the ground, either\r\nby the strength of their rising, or withered by the heat of the Sun.\r\nUpon these strings are found clusters of small heads or husks, out of\r\nwhich shoot forth whitish flowers, which afterwards give small pale\r\nwhite coloured seed, somewhat flat, and twice as big as Poppy-seed. It\r\ngenerally participates of the nature of the plant which it climbs upon;\r\nbut the Dodder of Thyme is accounted the best, and is the only true\r\nEpithymum.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] All Dodders are under Saturn. Tell not me of\r\nphysicians crying up Epithymum, or that Dodder which grows upon Thyme,\r\n(most of which comes from Hemetius in Greece, or Hybla in Sicily,\r\nbecause those mountains abound with Thyme,) he is a physician indeed,\r\nthat hath wit enough to choose the Dodder according to the nature of\r\nthe disease and humour peccant. We confess, Thyme is the hottest herb\r\nit usually grows upon; and therefore that which grows upon Thyme is\r\nhotter than that which grows upon cold herbs; for it draws nourishment\r\nfrom what it grows upon, as well as from the earth where its root is,\r\nand thus you see old Saturn is wise enough to have two strings to his\r\nbow. This is accounted the most effectual for melancholy diseases, and\r\nto purge black or burnt choler, which is the cause of many diseases of\r\nthe head and brain, as also for the trembling of the heart, faintings\r\nand swoonings. It is helpful in all diseases and griefs of the spleen,\r\nand melancholy that arises from the windiness of the hypochondria. It\r\npurges also the reins or kidneys by urine; it opens obstructions of\r\nthe gall, whereby it profits them that have the jaundice; as also the\r\nleaves, the spleen: Purging the veins of the choleric and phlegmatic\r\nhumours, and helps children in agues, a little worm seed being put\r\nthereto.\r\n\r\nThe other Dodders do, as I said before, participate of the nature of\r\nthose plants whereon they grow: As that which hath been found growing\r\nupon nettles in the west-country, hath by experience been found very\r\neffectual to procure plenty of urine where it hath been stopped or\r\nhindered. And so of the rest.\r\n\r\nSympathy and antipathy are two hinges upon which the whole mode of\r\nphysic turns; and that physician who minds them not, is like a door\r\noff from the hooks, more like to do a man mischief, than to secure\r\nhim. Then all the diseases Saturn causes, this helps by sympathy, and\r\nstrengthens all the parts of the body he rules; such as be caused by\r\nSol, it helps by antipathy. What those diseases are, see my judgment\r\nof diseases by astrology; and if you be pleased to look at the herb\r\nWormwood, you shall find a rational way for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n    DOG’S-GRASS, OR COUGH GRASS.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] IT is well known, that the grass creeps far about under\r\nground, with long white joined roots, and small fibres almost at every\r\njoint, very sweet in taste, as the rest of the herb is, and interlacing\r\none another, from whence shoot forth many fair grassy leaves, small at\r\nthe ends, and cutting or sharp on the edges. The stalks are jointed\r\nlike corn, with the like leaves on them, and a large spiked head, with\r\na long husk in them, and hard rough seed in them. If you know it not\r\nby this description, watch the dogs when they are sick, and they will\r\nquickly lead you to it.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows commonly through this land in divers ploughed\r\ngrounds to the no small trouble of the husbandmen, as also of the\r\ngardeners, in gardens, to weed it out, if they can; for it is a\r\nconstant customer to the place it get footing in.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] ’Tis under the dominion of Jupiter, and is\r\nthe most medicinal of all the Quick-grasses. Being boiled and drank, it\r\nopens obstructions of the liver and gall, and the stopping of urine,\r\nand eases the griping pains of the belly and inflammations; wastes the\r\nmatter of the stone in the bladder, and the ulcers thereof also. The\r\nroots bruised and applied, do consolidate wounds. The seed doth more\r\npowerfully expel urine, and stays the lask and vomiting. The distilled\r\nwater alone, or with a little wormseed, kills the worms in children.\r\n\r\nThe way of use is to bruise the roots, and having well boiled them in\r\nwhite wine, drink the decoction: ’Tis opening but not purging, very\r\nsafe: ’Tis a remedy against all diseases coming of stopping, and such\r\nare half those that are incident to the body of man; and although a\r\ngardener be of another opinion, yet a physician holds half an acre of\r\nthem to be worth five acres of Carrots twice told over.\r\n\r\n\r\n    DOVE’S-FOOT, OR CRANE’S-BILL.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS has divers small, round, pale-green leaves, cut in\r\nabout the edges, much like mallow, standing upon long, reddish, hairy\r\nstalks lying in a round compass upon the ground; among which rise up\r\ntwo or three, or more, reddish, jointed, slender, weak, hairy stalks,\r\nwith some like leaves thereon, but smaller, and more cut in up to the\r\ntops, where grow many very small bright red flowers of five leaves\r\na-piece; after which follow small heads, with small short beaks pointed\r\nforth, as all other sorts of those herbs do.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in pasture grounds, and by the path-sides in many\r\nplaces, and will also be in gardens.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in June, July, and August, some earlier and some\r\nlater; and the seed is ripe quickly after.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a very gentle, though martial plant.\r\nIt is found by experience to be singularly good for wind cholic, as\r\nalso to expel the stone and gravel in the kidneys. The decoction\r\nthereof in wine, is an excellent good cure for those that have inward\r\nwounds, hurts, or bruises, both to stay the bleeding, to dissolve and\r\nexpel the congealed blood, and to heal the parts, as also to cleanse\r\nand heal outward sores, ulcers, and fistulas; and for green wounds,\r\nmany do only bruise the herb, and apply it to the places, and it heals\r\nthem quickly. The same decoction in wine fomented to any place pained\r\nwith the gout, or to joint-aches, or pains of the sinews, gives much\r\nease. The powder or decoction of the herb taken for some time together,\r\nis found by experience to be singularly good for ruptures and burstings\r\nin people, either young or old.\r\n\r\n\r\n    DUCK’S MEAT.\r\n\r\nTHIS is so well known to swim on the tops of standing waters, as ponds,\r\npools, and ditches, that it is needless further to describe it.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Cancer claims the herb, and the Moon will\r\nbe Lady of it; a word is enough to a wise man. It is effectual to help\r\ninflammations, and St. Anthony’s Fire, as also the gout, either applied\r\nby itself, or in a poultice with Barley meal. The distilled water by\r\nsome is highly esteemed against all inward inflammations and pestilent\r\nfevers; as also to help the redness of the eyes, and swellings of\r\nprivities, and of the breasts before they be grown too much. The fresh\r\nherb applied to the forehead, eases the pains of the head-ache coming\r\nof heat.\r\n\r\n\r\n    DOWN, OR COTTON-THISTLE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS has large leaves lying on the ground, somewhat cut\r\nin, and as it were crumpled on the edges, of a green colour on the\r\nupper side, but covered with long hairy wool, or Cotton Down, set with\r\nmost sharp and cruel pricks, from the middle of whose head of flowers,\r\nthrust forth many purplish crimson threads, and sometimes (although\r\nvery seldom) white ones. The seed that follows in the heads, lying in\r\na great deal of white down, is somewhat large, long, and round, like\r\nthe seed of ladies thistle, but paler. The root is great and thick,\r\nspreading much, yet it usually dies after seed-time.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in divers ditches, banks, and in corn-fields, and\r\nhighways, generally every where throughout the land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers and bears seed about the end of Summer, when other\r\nthistles do flower and seed.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Mars owns the plant, and manifest to the\r\nworld, that though it may hurt your finger, it will help your body; for\r\nI fancy it much for the ensuing virtues. Pliny and Dioscorides write,\r\nThat the leaves and roots thereof taken in drink, help those that have\r\na crick in their neck; whereby they cannot turn their neck but their\r\nwhole body must turn also (sure they do not mean those that have got a\r\ncrick in their neck by being under the hangman’s hand.) Galen saith,\r\nthat the root and leaves hereof are of a healing quality, and good\r\nfor such persons as have their bodies drawn together by some spasm or\r\nconvulsion, as it is with children that have the rickets.\r\n\r\n\r\n    DRAGONS.\r\n\r\nTHEY are so well known to every one that plants them in their gardens,\r\nthey need no description; if not, let them look down to the lower end\r\nof the stalks, and see how like a snake they look.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The plant is under the dominion of Mars,\r\nand therefore it would be a wonder if it should want some obnoxious\r\nquality or other: In all herbs of that quality, the safest way is\r\neither to distil the herb in an alembick, in what vehicle you please,\r\nor else to press out the juice, and distil that in a glass still, in\r\nsand. It scours and cleanses the internal parts of the body mightily,\r\nand it clears the external parts also, being externally applied, from\r\nfreckles, morphew, and sun-burning: Your best way to use it externally,\r\nis to mix it with vinegar; an ointment of it is held to be good in\r\nwounds and ulcers; it consumes cankers, and that flesh growing in the\r\nnostrils, which they call Polypus: Also the distilled water being\r\ndropped into the eyes, takes away spots there, or the pin and web, and\r\nmends the dimness of sight; it is excellently good against pestilence\r\nand poison. Pliny and Dioscorides affirm, that no serpent will meddle\r\nwith him that carries this herb about him.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE ELDER TREE.\r\n\r\nI HOLD it needless to write any description of this, since every boy\r\nthat plays with a pop-gun will not mistake another tree instead of\r\nElder: I shall therefore in this place only describe the Dwarf-Elder,\r\ncalled also Dead-wort, and Wall-wort.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE DWARF-ELDER.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS is but an herb every year, dying with his stalks to\r\nthe ground, and rising afresh every Spring, and is like unto the Elder\r\nboth in form and quality, rising up with square, rough, hairy stalks,\r\nfour feet high, or more sometimes. The winged leaves are somewhat\r\nnarrower than the Elder, but else like them. The flowers are white with\r\na dash of purple, standing in umbels, very like the Elder also, but\r\nmore sweet is scent; after which come small blackish berries, full of\r\njuice while they are fresh, wherein is small hard kernels, or seed.\r\nThe root doth creep under the upper crust of the ground, springing in\r\ndivers places, being of the bigness of one’s finger or thumb sometimes.\r\n\r\n_Place._] The Elder-tree grows in hedges, being planted there to\r\nstrengthen the fences and partitions of ground, and to hold the banks\r\nby ditches and water-courses.\r\n\r\nThe Dwarf Elder grows wild in many places of England, where being once\r\ngotten into a ground, it is not easily gotten forth again.\r\n\r\n_Time._] Most of the Elder Trees, flower in June, and their fruit is\r\nripe for the most part in August. But the Dwarf Elder, or Wall-wort,\r\nflowers somewhat later, and his fruit is not ripe until September.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Both Elder and Dwarf Tree are under the\r\ndominion of Venus. The first shoots of the common Elder boiled like\r\nAsparagus, and the young leaves and stalks boiled in fat broth, doth\r\nmightily carry forth phlegm and choler. The middle or inward bark\r\nboiled in water, and given in drink, works much more violently; and\r\nthe berries, either green or dry, expel the same humour, and are often\r\ngiven with good success to help the dropsy; the bark of the root boiled\r\nin wine, or the juice thereof drank, works the same effects, but more\r\npowerfully than either the leaves or fruit. The juice of the root\r\ntaken, doth mightily procure vomitings, and purges the watery humours\r\nof the dropsy. The decoction of the root taken, cures the biting of\r\nan adder, and biting of mad dogs. It mollifies the hardness of the\r\nmother, if women sit thereon, and opens their veins, and brings down\r\ntheir courses: The berries boiled in wine perform the same effect; and\r\nthe hair of the head washed therewith is made black. The juice of the\r\ngreen leaves applied to the hot inflammations of the eyes, assuages\r\nthem; the juice of the leaves snuffed up into the nostrils, purges\r\nthe tunicles of the brain; the juice of the berries boiled with honey\r\nand dropped into the ears, helps the pains of them; the decoction of\r\nthe berries in wine, being drank, provokes urine; the distilled water\r\nof the flowers is of much use to clean the skin from sun-burning,\r\nfreckles, morphew, or the like; and takes away the head-ache, coming of\r\na cold cause, the head being bathed therewith. The leaves or flowers\r\ndistilled in the month of May, and the legs often washed with the\r\nsaid distilled water, it takes away the ulcers and sores of them. The\r\neyes washed therewith, it takes away the redness and bloodshot; and\r\nthe hands washed morning and evening therewith, helps the palsy, and\r\nshaking of them.\r\n\r\nThe Dwarf Elder is more powerful than the common Elder in opening and\r\npurging choler, phlegm, and water; in helping the gout, piles, and\r\nwomen’s diseases, colours the hair black, helps the inflammations\r\nof the eyes, and pains in the ears, the biting of serpents, or mad\r\ndogs, burnings and scaldings, the wind cholic, cholic, and stone, the\r\ndifficulty of urine, the cure of old sores and fistulous ulcers. Either\r\nleaves or bark of Elder, stripped upwards as you gather it, causes\r\nvomiting. Also, Dr. Butler, in a manuscript of his, commends Dwarf\r\nElder to the sky of dropsies, _viz._ to drink it, being boiled in white\r\nwine; to drink the decoction I mean, not the Elder.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE ELM TREE.\r\n\r\nTHIS tree is so well known, growing generally in all counties of this\r\nland, that it is needless to describe it.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a cold and saturnine plant. The leaves\r\nthereof bruised and applied, heal green wounds, being bound thereon\r\nwith its own bark. The leaves or the bark used with vinegar, cures\r\nscurf and leprosy very effectually; The decoction of the leaves, bark,\r\nor root, being bathed, heals broken bones. The water that is found\r\nin the bladders on the leaves, while it is fresh, is very effectual\r\nto cleanse the skin, and make it fair; and if cloaths be often wet\r\ntherein, and applied to the ruptures of children, it heals them, if\r\nthey be well bound up with a truss. The said water put into a glass,\r\nand set into the ground, or else in dung for twenty-five days, the\r\nmouth thereof being close stopped, and the bottom set upon a layer of\r\nordinary salt, that the fœces may settle and water become clear, is\r\na singular and sovereign balm for green wounds, being used with soft\r\ntents: The decoction of the bark of the root, fomented, mollifies hard\r\ntumours, and the shrinking of the sinews. The roots of the Elm, boiled\r\nfor a long time in water, and the fat arising on the top thereof, being\r\nclean skimmed off, and the place anointed therewith that is grown\r\nbald, and the hair fallen away, will quickly restore them again. The\r\nsaid bark ground with brine or pickle, until it come to the form of a\r\npoultice, and laid on the place pained with the gout, gives great ease.\r\nThe decoction of the bark in water, is excellent to bathe such places\r\nas have been burnt with fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ENDIVE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] COMMON garden Endive bears a longer and larger leaf than\r\nSuccory, and abides but one year, quickly running up to a stalk and\r\nseed, and then perishes; it has blue flowers, and the seed of the\r\nordinary Endive is so like Succory seed, that it is hard to distinguish\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a fine cooling, cleansing, jovial\r\nplant. The decoction of the leaves, or the juice, or the distilled\r\nwater of Endive, serve well to cool the excessive heat of the liver\r\nand stomach, and in the hot fits of agues, and all other inflammations\r\nin any part of the body; it cools the heat and sharpness of the\r\nurine, and excoriation in the urinary parts. The seeds are of the\r\nsame property, or rather more powerful, and besides are available for\r\nfainting, swoonings, and passions of the heart. Outwardly applied, they\r\nserve to temper the sharp humours of fretting ulcers, hot tumours,\r\nswellings, and pestilential sores; and wonderfully help not only the\r\nredness and inflammations of the eyes, but the dimness of the sight\r\nalso; they are also used to allay the pains of the gout. You cannot use\r\nit amiss; a syrup of it is a fine cooling medicine for fevers.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ELECAMPANE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] IT shoots forth many large leaves, long and broad, lying\r\nnear the ground, small at both ends, somewhat soft in handling of a\r\nwhitish green on the upper side, and grey underneath, each set upon\r\na short footstalk, from among which arise up divers great and strong\r\nhairy stalks, three or four feet high, with some leaves thereupon,\r\ncompassing them about at the lower end, and are branched towards the\r\ntops, bearing divers great and large flowers, like those of the corn\r\nmarigold, both the border of leaves, and the middle thrum being yellow,\r\nwhich turn into down, with long, small, brownish seeds amongst it, and\r\nis carried away with the wind. The root is great and thick, branched\r\nforth divers ways, blackish on the outside and whitish within, of a\r\nvery bitter taste, and strong, but good scent, especially when they are\r\ndried, no part else of the plant having any smell.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows on moist grounds, and shadowy places oftener than in\r\nthe dry and open borders of the fields and lanes, and in other waste\r\nplaces, almost in every county of this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in the end of June and July, and the seed is ripe\r\nin August. The roots are gathered for use, as well in the Spring\r\nbefore the leaves come forth, as in Autumn or Winter.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a plant under the dominion of Mercury.\r\nThe fresh roots of Elecampane preserved with sugar, or made into a\r\nsyrup or conserve, are very effectual to warm a cold windy stomach,\r\nor the pricking therein, and stiches in the sides caused by the\r\nspleen; and to help the cough, shortness of breath, and wheezing in\r\nthe lungs. The dried root made into powder, and mixed with sugar, and\r\ntaken, serves to the same purpose, and is also profitable for those\r\nwho have their urine stopped, or the stopping of women’s courses, the\r\npains of the mother and the stone in the reins, kidneys, or bladder;\r\nit resists poison, and stays the spreading of the venom of serpents,\r\nas also putrid and pestilential fevers, and the plague itself. The\r\nroots and herbs beaten and put into new ale or beer, and daily drank,\r\nclears, strengthens, and quickens the sight of the eyes wonderfully.\r\nThe decoction of the roots in wine, or the juice taken therein, kills\r\nand drives forth all manner of worms in the belly, stomach, and maw;\r\nand gargled in the mouth, or the root chewed, fastens loose teeth, and\r\nhelps to keep them from putrefaction; and being drank is good for those\r\nthat spit blood, helps to remove cramps or convulsions, gout, sciatica,\r\npains in the joints, applied outwardly or inwardly, and is also good\r\nfor those that are bursten, or have any inward bruise. The root boiled\r\nwell in vinegar beaten afterwards, and made into an ointment with hog’s\r\nsuet, or oil of trotters is an excellent remedy for scabs or itch in\r\nyoung or old; the places also bathed or washed with the decoction\r\ndoth the same; it also helps all sorts of filthy old putrid sores or\r\ncankers whatsoever. In the roots of this herb lieth the chief effect\r\nfor the remedies aforesaid. The distilled water of the leaves and roots\r\ntogether, is very profitable to cleanse the skin of the face, or other\r\nparts, from any morphew, spots, or blemishes therein, and make it\r\nclear.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ERINGO, OR SEA-HOLLY.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THE first leaves of our ordinary Sea-holly, are nothing so\r\nhard and prickly as when they grow old, being almost round, and deeply\r\ndented about the edges, hard and sharp pointed, and a little crumpled,\r\nof a bluish green colour, every one upon a long foot stalk; but those\r\nthat grow up higher with the stalk, do as it were compass it about. The\r\nstalk itself is round and strong, yet somewhat crested, with joints and\r\nleaves set thereat, but more divided, sharp and prickly; and branches\r\nrising from thence, which have likewise other small branches, each of\r\nthem having several bluish round prickly heads, with many small jagged\r\nprickly leaves under them, standing like a star, and sometimes found\r\ngreenish or whitish: The root grows wonderfully long, even to eight or\r\nten feet in length, set with rings and circles towards the upper part,\r\ncut smooth and without joints down lower, brownish on the outside, and\r\nvery white within, with a pith in the middle; of a pleasant taste, but\r\nmuch more, being artificially preserved, and candied with sugar.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It is found about the sea coast in almost every county of\r\nthis land which borders upon the sea.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in the end of Summer, and gives ripe seed within a\r\nmonth after.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The plant is venereal, and breeds seed\r\nexceedingly, and strengthens the spirit procreative; it is hot and\r\nmoist, and under the celestial Balance. The decoction of the root\r\nhereof in wine, is very effectual to open obstructions of the spleen\r\nand liver, and helps yellow jaundice, dropsy, pains of the loins, and\r\nwind cholic, provokes urine, and expels the stone, procures women’s\r\ncourses. The continued use of the decoction for fifteen days, taken\r\nfasting, and next to bedward, doth help the stranguary, the difficulty\r\nand stoppage of urine, and the stone, as well as all defects of the\r\nreins and kidneys; and if the said drink be continued longer, it is\r\nsaid that it cures the stone; it is found good against the French\r\npox. The roots bruised and applied outwardly, help the kernels of\r\nthe throat, commonly called the king’s evil; or taking inwardly, and\r\napplied to the place stung or bitten by any serpent, heal it speedily.\r\nIf the roots be bruised, and boiled in old hog’s grease, or salted\r\nlard, and broken bones, thorns &c. remaining in the flesh, they do\r\nnot only draw them forth, but heal up the place again, gathering new\r\nflesh where it was consumed. The juice of the leaves dropped into the\r\near, helps imposthumes therein. The distilled water of the whole herb,\r\nwhen the leaves and stalks are young, is profitable drank for all the\r\npurposes aforesaid; and helps the melancholy of the heart, and is\r\navailable in quartan and quotidian agues; as also for them that have\r\ntheir necks drawn awry, and cannot turn them without turning their\r\nwhole body.\r\n\r\n\r\n    EYEBRIGHT.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] COMMON Eyebright is a small low herb, rising up usually\r\nbut with one blackish green stalk a span high, or not much more,\r\nspread from the bottom into sundry branches, whereon are small and\r\nalmost round yet pointed dark green leaves, finely snipped about the\r\nedges, two always set together, and very thick: At the joints with the\r\nleaves, from the middle upward, come forth small white flowers, marked\r\nwith purple and yellow spots, or stripes; after which follow small\r\nround heads, with very small seed therein. The root is long, small and\r\nthready at the end.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in meadows, and grassy land.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the sign of the Lion, and Sol\r\nclaims dominion over it. If the herb was but as much used as it is\r\nneglected, it would half spoil the spectacle maker’s trade; and a man\r\nwould think, that reason should teach people to prefer the preservation\r\nof their natural before artificial spectacles; which that they may be\r\ninstructed how to do, take the virtues of Eyebright as follows.\r\n\r\nThe juice or distilled water of Eyebright, taken inwardly in white wine\r\nor broth, or dropped into the eyes for divers days together, helps all\r\ninfirmities of the eyes that cause dimness of sight. Some make conserve\r\nof the flowers to the same effect. Being used any of the ways, it also\r\nhelps a weak brain, or memory. This tunned up with strong beer, that\r\nit may work together, and drank, or the powder of the dried herb mixed\r\nwith sugar, a little Mace, and Fennel seed, and drank, or eaten in\r\nbroth; or the said powder made into an electuary with sugar, and taken,\r\nhas the same powerful effect to help and restore the sight, decayed\r\nthrough age; and Arnoldus de Ville Nova saith, it hath restored sight\r\nto them that have been blind a long time before.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FERN.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] OF this there are two kinds principally to be treated of,\r\n_viz._ the Male and Female. The Female grows higher than the Male, but\r\nthe leaves thereof are smaller, and more divided and dented, and of\r\nas strong a smell as the male; the virtue of them are both alike, and\r\ntherefore I shall not trouble you with any description or distinction\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow both in heaths and in shady places near the\r\nhedge-sides in all counties of this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower and give their seed at Midsummer.\r\n\r\nThe Female Fern is that plant which is in Sussex, called Brakes, the\r\nseed of which some authors hold to be so rare: Such a thing there is I\r\nknow, and may be easily had upon Midsummer Eve, and for ought I know,\r\ntwo or three days after it, if not more.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of Mercury, both\r\nMale and Female. The roots of both these sorts of Fern being bruised\r\nand boiled in Mead, or honeyed water, and drank, kills both the broad\r\nand long worms in the body, and abates the swelling and hardness of\r\nthe spleen. The green leaves eaten, purge the belly of choleric and\r\nwaterish humours that trouble the stomach. They are dangerous for women\r\nwith child to meddle with, by reason they cause abortions. The roots\r\nbruised and boiled in oil, or hog’s grease, make a very profitable\r\nointment to heal wounds, or pricks gotten in the flesh. The powder of\r\nthem used in foul ulcers, dries up their malignant moisture, and causes\r\ntheir speedier healing. Fern being burned, the smoke thereof drives\r\naway serpents, gnats, and other noisome creatures, which in fenny\r\ncountries do in the night time, trouble and molest people lying in\r\ntheir beds with their faces uncovered; it causes barrenness.\r\n\r\n\r\n    OSMOND ROYAL, OR WATER FERN.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS shoots forth in Spring time (for in the Winter the\r\nleaves perish) divers rough hard stalks, half round, and yellowish, or\r\nflat on the other side, two feet high, having divers branches of winged\r\nyellowish green leaves on all sides, set one against another, longer,\r\nnarrower, and not nicked on the edges as the former. From the top of\r\nsome of these stalks grow forth a long bush of small and more yellow,\r\ngreen, scaly aglets, set in the same manner on the stalks as the leaves\r\nare, which are accounted the flowers and seeds. The root is rough,\r\nthick and scabby: with a white pith in the middle, which is called the\r\nheart thereof.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows on moors, bogs, and watery places, in many parts of\r\nthis land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It is green all the summer, and the root only abides in winter.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Saturn owns the plant. This has all the\r\nvirtues mentioned in the former Ferns, and is much more effectual than\r\nthey, both for inward and outward griefs, and is accounted singularly\r\ngood in wounds, bruises, or the like. The decoction to be drank, or\r\nboiled into an ointment of oil, as a balsam or balm, and so it is\r\nsingularly good against bruises, and bones broken, or out of joint,\r\nand gives much ease to the cholic and splenetic diseases: as also\r\nfor ruptures or burstings. The decoction of the root in white wine,\r\nprovokes urine exceedingly, and cleanses the bladder and passages of\r\nurine.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FEVERFEW OR FEATHERFEW.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] COMMON Featherfew has large, fresh, green leaves, much\r\ntorn or cut on the edges. The stalks are hard and round, set with\r\nmany such like leaves, but smaller, and at the tops stand many single\r\nflowers, upon small foot stalks, consisting of many small white leaves\r\nstanding round about a yellow thrum in the middle. The root is somewhat\r\nhard and short, with many strong fibres about it. The scent of the\r\nwhole plant is very strong, and the taste is very bitter.\r\n\r\n_Place._] This grows wild in many places of the land, but is for the\r\nmost part nourished in gardens.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in the months of June and July.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Venus commands this herb, and has commended\r\nit to succour her sisters (women) and to be a general strengthener of\r\ntheir wombs, and remedy such infirmities as a careless midwife hath\r\nthere caused if they will but be pleased to make use of her herb\r\nboiled in white wine, and drink the decoction; it cleanses the womb,\r\nexpels the after-birth, and doth a woman all the good she can desire of\r\nan herb. And if any grumble because they cannot get the herb in winter,\r\ntell them, if they please, they may make a syrup of it in summer;\r\nit is chiefly used for the disease of the mother, whether it be the\r\nstrangling or rising of the mother, or hardness, or inflammation of\r\nthe same, applied outwardly thereunto. Or a decoction of the flowers\r\nin wine, with a little Nutmeg or Mace put therein, and drank often in\r\na day, is an approved remedy to bring down women’s courses speedily,\r\nand helps to expel the dead birth and after-birth. For a woman to sit\r\nover the hot fumes of the decoction of the herb made in water or wine,\r\nis effectual for the same; and in some cases to apply the boiled herb\r\nwarm to the privy parts. The decoction thereof made with some sugar, or\r\nhoney put thereto, is used by many with good success to help the cough\r\nand stuffing of the chest, by colds, as also to cleanse the reins and\r\nbladder, and helps to expel the stone in them. The powder of the herb\r\ntaken in wine, with some Oxymel, purges both choler and phlegm, and\r\nis available for those that are short winded, and are troubled with\r\nmelancholy and heaviness, or sadness of spirits. It is very effectual\r\nfor all pains in the head coming of a cold cause, the herb being\r\nbruised and applied to the crown of the head: As also for the vertigo,\r\nthat is a running or swimming in the head. The decoction thereof drank\r\nwarm, and the herb bruised with a few corns of Bay salt, and applied to\r\nthe wrists before the coming of the ague fits, doth take them away. The\r\ndistilled water takes away freckles, and other spots and deformities\r\nin the face. The herb bruised and heated on a tile, with some wine to\r\nmoisten it, or fried with a little wine and oil in a frying-pan, and\r\napplied warm outwardly to the places, helps the wind and cholic in the\r\nlower part of the belly. It is an especial remedy against opium taken\r\ntoo liberally.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FENNEL.\r\n\r\nEVERY garden affords this so plentifully, that it needs no description.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] One good old fashion is not yet left off,\r\n_viz._ to boil Fennel with fish; for it consumes that phlegmatic\r\nhumour, which fish most plentifully afford and annoy the body with,\r\nthough few that use it know wherefore they do it; I suppose the reason\r\nof its benefit this way is because it is an herb of Mercury, and under\r\nVirgo, and therefore bears antipathy to Pisces. Fennel is good to break\r\nwind, to provoke urine, and ease the pains of the stone, and helps to\r\nbreak it. The leaves or seed, boiled in barley water and drank are good\r\nfor nurses, to increase their milk, and make it more wholesome for the\r\nchild. The leaves, or rather the seeds, boiled in water, stays the\r\nhiccough, and takes away the loathings which oftentimes happen to the\r\nstomachs of sick and feverish persons and allays the heat thereof. The\r\nseed boiled in wine and drank, is good for those that are bitten with\r\nserpents, or have eaten poisonous herbs, or mushrooms. The seed and\r\nthe roots much more, help to open obstructions of the liver, spleen,\r\nand gall, and thereby help the painful and windy swellings of the\r\nspleen, and the yellow jaundice; as also the gout and cramps. The seed\r\nis of good use in medicines to help shortness of breath and wheezing\r\nby stopping of the lungs. It helps also to bring down the courses,\r\nand to cleanse the parts after delivery. The roots are of most use in\r\nphysic drinks, and broth that are taken to cleanse the blood, to open\r\nobstructions of the liver, to provoke urine, and amend the ill colour\r\nin the face after sickness, and to cause a good habit through the\r\nbody. Both leaves, seeds, and roots thereof are much used in drink or\r\nbroth, to make people more lean that are too fat. The distilled water\r\nof the whole herb, or the condensate juice dissolved, but especially\r\nthe natural juice, that in some counties issues out hereof of its own\r\naccord, dropped into the eyes, cleanses them from mists and films that\r\nhinder the sight. The sweet Fennel is much weaker in physical uses\r\nthan the common Fennel. The wild Fennel is stronger and hotter than\r\nthe tame, and therefore most powerful against the stone, but not so\r\neffectual to encrease milk, because of its dryness.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SOW-FENNEL, OR HOG’S-FENNEL.\r\n\r\nBESIDES the common name in English, Hog’s Fennel, and the Latin name\r\nPeucidanum, is called Hoar-strange, and Hoar-strong, Sulphur-wort, and\r\nBrimstone-wort.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The common Sow-Fennel has divers branched stalks of thick\r\nand somewhat long leaves, three for the most part joined together at a\r\nplace, among which arises a crested straight stalk, less than Fennel,\r\nwith some joints thereon, and leaves growing thereat, and towards the\r\ntops some branches issuing from thence; likewise on the tops of the\r\nstalks and branches stand divers tufts of yellow flowers, whereafter\r\ngrows somewhat flat, thin, and yellowish seed, bigger than Fennel seed.\r\nThe roots grow great and deep, with many other parts and fibres about\r\nthem of a strong scent like hot brimstone, and yield forth a yellowish\r\nmilk, or clammy juice, almost like a gum.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows plentifully in the salt low marshes near Feversham\r\nin Kent.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers plentifully in July and August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] This is also an herb of Mercury. The juice\r\nof Sow-Fennel (saith Dioscorides, and Galen,) used with vinegar and\r\nrose water, or the juice with a little Euphorbium put to the nose,\r\nhelps those that are troubled with the lethargy, frenzy, giddiness of\r\nthe head, the falling sickness, long and inveterate head-aches, the\r\npalsy, sciatica, and the cramp, and generally all the diseases of the\r\nsinews, used with oil and vinegar. The juice dissolved in wine, or put\r\ninto an egg, is good for a cough, or shortness of breath, and for those\r\nthat are troubled with wind in the body. It purges the belly gently,\r\nexpels the hardness of the spleen, gives ease to women that have sore\r\ntravail in child-birth, and eases the pains of the reins and bladder,\r\nand also the womb. A little of the juice dissolved in wine, and dropped\r\ninto the ears, eases much of the pains in them, and put into a hollow\r\ntooth, eases the pain thereof. The root is less effectual to all the\r\naforesaid disorders; yet the powder of the root cleanses foul ulcers,\r\nbeing put into them, and takes out splinters of broken bones, or other\r\nthings in the flesh, and heals them up perfectly: as also, dries up old\r\nand inveterate running sores, and is of admirable virtue in all green\r\nwounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FIG-WORT, OR THROAT-WORT.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] COMMON great Fig-wort sends divers great, strong, hard,\r\nsquare brown stalks, three or four feet high, whereon grow large, hard,\r\nand dark green leaves, two at a joint, harder and larger than Nettle\r\nleaves, but not stinking; at the tops of the stalks stand many purple\r\nflowers set in husks, which are sometimes gaping and open, somewhat\r\nlike those of Water Betony; after which come hard round heads, with a\r\nsmall point in the middle, wherein lie small brownish seed. The root is\r\ngreat, white, and thick, with many branches at it, growing aslope under\r\nthe upper crust of the ground, which abides many years, but keeps not\r\nhis green leaves in Winter.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows frequently in moist and shadowy woods, and in the\r\nlower parts of the fields and meadows.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers about July, and the seed will be ripe about a month\r\nafter the flowers are fallen.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Some Latin authors call it Cervicaria,\r\nbecause it is appropriated to the neck; and we Throat-wort, because it\r\nis appropriated to the throat. Venus owns the herb, and the Celestial\r\nBull will not deny it; therefore a better remedy cannot be for the\r\nking’s evil, because the Moon that rules the disease, is exalted there.\r\nThe decoction of the herb taken inwardly, and the bruised herb applied\r\noutwardly, dissolves clotted and congealed blood within the body,\r\ncoming by any wounds, bruise, or fall; and is no less effectual for the\r\nking’s evil, or any other knobs, kernel, bunches, or wens growing in\r\nthe flesh wheresoever; and for the hæmorrhoids, or piles. An ointment\r\nmade hereof may be used at all times when the fresh herb is not to be\r\nhad. The distilled water of the whole plant, roots and all, is used\r\nfor the same purposes, and dries up the superfluous, virulent moisture\r\nof hollow and corroding ulcers; it takes away all redness, spots,\r\nand freckles in the face, as also the scurf, and any foul deformity\r\ntherein, and the leprosy likewise.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FILIPENDULA, OR DROP-WORT.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS sends forth many leaves, some larger, some smaller,\r\nset on each side of a middle rib, and each of them dented about the\r\nedges, somewhat resembling wild Tansy, or rather Agrimony, but harder\r\nin handling; among which rise up one or more stalks, two or three feet\r\nhigh, with the leaves growing thereon, and sometimes also divided into\r\nother branches spreading at the top into many white, sweet-smelling\r\nflowers, consisting of five leaves a-piece, with some threads in the\r\nmiddle of them, standing together in a pith or umble, each upon a\r\nsmall foot stalk, which after they have been blown upon a good while,\r\ndo fall away, and in their places appear small, round, chaffy heads\r\nlike buttons, wherein are the chaffy seeds set and placed. The root\r\nconsists of many small, black, tuberous pieces, fastened together by\r\nmany small, long, blackish strings, which run from one to another.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in many places of this land, in the corners of dry\r\nfields and meadows, and the hedge sides.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in June and July, and their seed is ripe in August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of Venus. It\r\neffectually opens the passages of the urine, helps the stranguary; the\r\nstone in the kidneys or bladder, the gravel, and all other pains of the\r\nbladder and reins, by taking the roots in powder, or a decoction of\r\nthem in white wine, with a little honey. The roots made into powder,\r\nand mixed with honey in the form of an electuary, doth much help them\r\nwhose stomachs are swollen, dissolving and breaking the wind which was\r\nthe cause thereof; and is also very effectual for all the diseases of\r\nthe lungs, as shortness of breath, wheezing, hoarseness of the throat,\r\nand the cough; and to expectorate tough phlegm, or any other parts\r\nthereabout.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE FIG-TREE.\r\n\r\nTO give a description of a tree so well known to every body that keep\r\nit in his garden, were needless. They prosper very well in our English\r\ngardens, yet are fitter for medicine than for any other profit which is\r\ngotten by the fruit of them.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The tree is under the dominion of Jupiter.\r\nThe milk that issues out from the leaves or branches where they are\r\nbroken off, being dropped upon warts, takes them away. The decoction\r\nof the leaves is excellently good to wash sore heads with: and there\r\nis scarcely a better remedy for the leprosy than it is. It clears the\r\nface also of morphew, and the body of white scurf, scabs, and running\r\nsores. If it be dropped into old fretting ulcers, it cleanses out the\r\nmoisture, and brings up the flesh; because you cannot have the leaves\r\ngreen all the year, you may make an ointment of them whilst you can. A\r\ndecoction of the leaves being drank inwardly, or rather a syrup made\r\nof them, dissolves congealed blood caused by bruises or falls, and\r\nhelps the bloody flux. The ashes of the wood made into an ointment with\r\nhog’s grease, helps kibes and chilblains. The juice being put into an\r\nhollow tooth, eases pain: as also pain and noise in the ears, being\r\ndropped into them; and deafness. An ointment made of the juice and\r\nhog’s grease, is an excellent remedy for the bitten of mad dogs, or\r\nother venomous beasts as most are. A syrup made of the leaves, or green\r\nfruit, is excellently good for coughs, hoarseness, or shortness of\r\nbreath, and all diseases of the breast and lungs; it is also extremely\r\ngood for the dropsy and falling sickness. They say that the Fig Tree,\r\nas well as the Bay Tree, is never hurt by lightning; as also, if you\r\ntie a bull, be he ever so mad, to a Fig Tree, he will quickly become\r\ntame and gentle. As for such figs as come from beyond sea, I have\r\nlittle to say, because I write not of exoticks.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE YELLOW WATER-FLAG, OR FLOWER-DE-LUCE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS grows like the Flower-de-luce, but it has much longer\r\nand narrower sad green leaves, joined together in that fashion; the\r\nstalk also growing oftentimes as high, bearing small yellow flowers\r\nshaped like the Flower-de-luce, with three falling leaves, and other\r\nthree arched that cover their bottoms; but instead of the three\r\nupright leaves, as the Flower-de-luce has, this has only three short\r\npieces standing in their places, after which succeed thick and long\r\nthree square heads, containing in each part somewhat big and flat seed,\r\nlike those of the Flower-de-luce. The root is long and slender, of a\r\npale brownish colour on the outside, and of a horseflesh colour on the\r\ninside, with many hard fibres thereat, and very harsh in taste.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It usually grows in watery ditches, ponds, lakes, and moor\r\nsides, which are always overflowed with water.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in July, and the seed is ripe in August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of the Moon. The\r\nroot of this Water-flag is very astringent, cooling, and drying; and\r\nthereby helps all lasks and fluxes, whether of blood or humours, as\r\nbleeding at the mouth, nose, or other parts, bloody flux, and the\r\nimmoderate flux of women’s courses. The distilled water of the whole\r\nherb, flowers and roots, is a sovereign good remedy for watering eyes,\r\nboth to be dropped into them, and to have cloths or sponges wetted\r\ntherein, and applied to the forehead: It also helps the spots and\r\nblemishes that happen in and about the eyes, or in any other parts:\r\nThe said water fomented on swellings and hot inflammations of women’s\r\nbreasts, upon cancers also, and those spreading ulcers called _Noli me\r\ntangere_, do much good: It helps also foul ulcers in the privities of\r\nman or woman; but an ointment made of the flowers is better for those\r\nexternal applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FLAX-WEED, OR TOAD-FLAX.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] OUR common Flax-weed has divers stalks full fraught with\r\nlong and narrow ash-coloured leaves, and from the middle of them almost\r\nupward, stored with a number of pale yellow flowers, of a strong\r\nunpleasant scent, with deeper yellow mouths, and blackish flat seed in\r\nround heads. The root is somewhat woody and white, especially the main\r\ndownright one, with many fibres, abiding many years, shooting forth\r\nroots every way round about, and new branches every year.\r\n\r\n_Place._] This grows throughout this land, both by the way sides and\r\nin meadows, as also by hedge-sides, and upon the sides of banks, and\r\nborders of fields.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in Summer, and the seed is ripe usually before the\r\nend of August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Mars owns the herb: In Sussex we call it\r\nGallwort, and lay it in our chicken’s water to cure them of the gall;\r\nit relieves them when they are drooping. This is frequently used to\r\nspend the abundance of those watery humours by urine which cause\r\nthe dropsy. The decoction of the herb, both leaves and flowers, in\r\nwine, taken and drank, doth somewhat move the belly downwards, opens\r\nobstructions of the liver, and helps the yellow jaundice; expels\r\npoison, provokes women’s courses, drives forth the dead child, and\r\nafter-birth. The distilled water of the herb and flowers is effectual\r\nfor all the same purposes; being drank with a dram of the powder of the\r\nseeds of bark or the roots of Wall-wort, and a little Cinnamon, for\r\ncertain days together, it is held a singular remedy for the dropsy.\r\nThe juice of the herb, or the distilled water, dropped into the eyes,\r\nis a certain remedy for all heat, inflammation, and redness in them.\r\nThe juice or water put into foul ulcers, whether they be cancerous or\r\nfistulous, with tents rolled therein, or parts washed and injected\r\ntherewith, cleanses them thoroughly from the bottom, and heals them up\r\nsafely. The same juice or water also cleanses the skin wonderfully of\r\nall sorts of deformity, as leprosy, morphew, scurf, wheals, pimples,\r\nor spots, applied of itself, or used with some powder of Lupines.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FLEA-WORT.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] ORDINARY Flea-wort rises up with a stalk two feet high or\r\nmore, full of joints and branches on every side up to the top, and at\r\nevery joint two small, long and narrow whitish green leaves somewhat\r\nhairy. At the top of every branch stand divers small, short scaly, or\r\nchaffy heads out of which come forth small whitish yellow threads, like\r\nto those of the Plantain herbs, which are the bloomings of flowers. The\r\nseed enclosed in these heads is small and shining while it is fresh,\r\nvery like unto fleas both for colour and bigness, but turning black\r\nwhen it grows old. The root is not long, but white, hard and woody,\r\nperishing every year, and rising again of its own seed for divers\r\nyears, if it be suffered to shed: The whole plant is somewhat whitish\r\nand hairy, smelling somewhat like rosin.\r\n\r\nThere is another sort hereof, differing not from the former in the\r\nmanner of growing, but only that the stalk and branches being somewhat\r\ngreater, do a little more bow down to the ground: The leaves are\r\nsomewhat greater, the heads somewhat less, the seed alike; and the root\r\nand leaves abide all winter, and perish not as the former.\r\n\r\n_Place._] The first grows only in gardens, the second plentifully in\r\nfields that are near the sea.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in July or thereabouts.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The herb is cold, and dry, and saturnine.\r\nI suppose it obtained the name of Flea-wort, because the seeds are\r\nso like Fleas. The seeds fried, and taken, stays the flux or lask of\r\nthe belly, and the corrosions that come by reason of hot choleric, or\r\nsharp and malignant humours, or by too much purging of any violent\r\nmedicine, as Scammony, or the like. The mucilage of the seed made\r\nwith Rose-water, and a little sugar-candy put thereto, is very good in\r\nall hot agues and burning fevers, and other inflammations, to cool the\r\nthirst, and lenify the dryness and roughness of the tongue and throat.\r\nIt helps also hoarseness of the voice, and diseases of the breast\r\nand lungs, caused by heat, or sharp salt humours, and the pleurisy\r\nalso. The mucilage of the seed made with Plantain water, whereunto\r\nthe yoke of an egg or two, and a little Populeon are put, is a most\r\nsafe and sure remedy to ease the sharpness, pricking, and pains of the\r\nhæmorrhoids or piles, if it be laid on a cloth, and bound thereto. It\r\nhelps all inflammations in any part of the body, and the pains that\r\ncome thereby, as the headache and megrims, and all hot imposthumes,\r\nswellings, or breaking out of the skin, as blains, wheals, pushes,\r\npurples, and the like, as also the joints of those that are out of\r\njoint, the pains of the gout and sciatica, the burstings of young\r\nchildren, and the swellings of the navel, applied with oil of roses\r\nand vinegar. It is also good to heal the nipples and sore breasts of\r\nwomen, being often applied thereunto. The juice of the herb with a\r\nlittle honey put into the ears helps the running of them, and the worms\r\nbreeding in them: The same also mixed with hog’s grease, and applied to\r\ncorrupt and filthy ulcers, cleanses them and heals them.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FLUX-WEED.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] IT rises up with a round upright hard stalk, four or five\r\nfeet high, spread into sundry branches, whereon grow many greyish green\r\nleaves, very finely cut and severed into a number of short and almost\r\nround parts. The flowers are very small and yellow, growing spike\r\nfashion, after which come small long pods, with small yellowish seed in\r\nthem. The root is long and woody, perishing every year.\r\n\r\nThere is another sort, differing in nothing, save only it has somewhat\r\nbroad leaves; they have a strong evil saviour, being smelled unto, and\r\nare of a drying taste.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They flower wild in the fields by hedge-sides and highways,\r\nand among rubbish and other places.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower and seed quickly after, namely in June and July.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] This herb is saturnine also. Both the herb\r\nand seed of Flux-weed is of excellent use to stay the flux or lask of\r\nthe belly, being drank in water wherein gads of steel heated have been\r\noften quenched; and is no less effectual for the same purpose than\r\nPlantain or Comfrey, and to restrain any other flux of blood in man or\r\nwoman, as also to consoladate bones broken or out of joint. The juice\r\nthereof drank in wine, or the decoction of the herb drank, doth kill\r\nthe worms in the stomach or belly, or the worms that grow in putrid\r\nand filthy ulcers, and made into a salve doth quickly heal all old\r\nsores, how foul or malignant soever they be. The distilled water of\r\nthe herb works the same effect, although somewhat weaker, yet it is a\r\nfair medicine, and more acceptable to be taken. It is called Flux-weed\r\nbecause it cures the flux, and for its uniting broken bones, &c.\r\nParacelsus extols it to the skies. It is fitting that syrup, ointment,\r\nand plaisters of it were kept in your house.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FLOWER-DE-LUCE.\r\n\r\nIT is so well known, being nourished up in most gardens, that I shall\r\nnot need to spent time in writing a description thereof.\r\n\r\n_Time._] The flaggy kinds thereof have the most physical uses; the\r\ndwarf kinds thereof flowers in April, the greater sorts in May.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The herb is Luner. The juice or decoction\r\nof the green root of the flaggy kind of Flower-de-luce, with a little\r\nhoney drank, doth purge and cleanse the stomach of gross and tough\r\nphlegm, and choler therein; it helps the jaundice and the dropsy,\r\nevacuating those humours both upwards and downwards; and because it\r\nsomewhat hurts the stomach, is not to be taken without honey and\r\nspikenard. The same being drank, doth ease the pains and torments of\r\nthe belly and sides, the shaking of agues, the diseases of the liver\r\nand spleen, the worms of the belly, the stone in the reins, convulsions\r\nand cramps that come of old humours; it also helps those whose seed\r\npasses from them unawares: It is a remedy against the bitings and\r\nstingings of venomous creatures, being boiled in water and vinegar and\r\ndrank. Boiled in water and drank, it provokes urine, helps the cholic,\r\nbrings down women’s courses; and made up into a pessary with honey, and\r\nput up into the body, draws forth the dead child. It is much commended\r\nagainst the cough, to expectorate rough phlegm. It much eases pains in\r\nthe head, and procures sleep; being put into the nostrils it procures\r\nsneezing, and thereby purges the head of phlegm. The juice of the root\r\napplied to the piles or hæmorrhoids, gives much ease. The decoction of\r\nthe roots gargled in the mouth, eases the tooth-ache, and helps the\r\nstinking breath. Oil called Oleum Irinum, if it be rightly made of\r\nthe great broad flag Flower-de-luce and not of the great bulbous blue\r\nFlower-de-luce, (as is used by some apothecaries) and roots of the\r\nsame, of the flaggy kinds, is very effectual to warm and comfort all\r\ncold joints and sinews, as also the gout and sciatica, and mollifies,\r\ndissolves and consumes tumours and swellings in any part of the body,\r\nas also of the matrix; it helps the cramp, or convulsions of the\r\nsinews. The head and temples anointed therewith, helps the catarrh or\r\nthin rheum distilled from thence; and used upon the breast or stomach,\r\nhelps to extenuate the cold tough phlegm; it helps also the pains and\r\nnoise in the ears, and the stench of the nostrils. The root itself,\r\neither green or in powder, helps to cleanse, heal, and incarnate\r\nwounds, and to cover the naked bones with flesh again, that ulcers have\r\nmade bare; and is also very good to cleanse and heal up fistulas and\r\ncankers that are hard to be cured.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FLUELLIN, OR LLUELLIN.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] IT shoots forth many long branches partly lying upon the\r\nground, and partly standing upright, set with almost red leaves, yet\r\na little pointed, and sometimes more long than round, without order\r\nthereon, somewhat hairy, and of an evil greenish white colour; at the\r\njoints all along the stalks, and with the leaves come forth small\r\nflowers, one at a place, upon a very small short foot-stalk, gaping\r\nsomewhat like Snap-dragons, or rather like Toad-flax, with the upper\r\njaw of a yellow colour, and the lower of a purplish, with a small heel\r\nor spur behind; after which come forth small round heads, containing\r\nsmall black seed. The root is small and thready, dying every year, and\r\nrises itself again of its own sowing.\r\n\r\nThere is another sort of Lluellin which has longer branches wholly\r\ntrailing upon the ground, two or three feet long, and somewhat more\r\nthin, set with leaves thereon, upon small foot-stalks. The leaves are\r\na little larger, and somewhat round, and cornered sometimes in some\r\nplaces on the edges; but the lower part of them being the broadest,\r\nhath on each side a small point, making it seem as if they were ears,\r\nsometimes hairy, but not hoary, and of a better green colour than the\r\nformer. The flowers come forth like the former, but the colours therein\r\nare more white than yellow, and the purple not so far. It is a large\r\nflower, and so are the seed and seed-vessels. The root is like the\r\nother, and perishes every year.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow in divers corn fields, and in borders about them,\r\nand in other fertile grounds about Southfleet in Kent abundantly; at\r\nBuchrite, Hamerton, and Rickmanworth in Huntingdonshire, and in divers\r\nother places.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They are in flower about June and July, and the whole plant is\r\ndry and withered before August be done.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a Lunar herb. The leaves bruised and\r\napplied with barley meal to watering eyes that are hot and inflamed by\r\ndefluxions from the head, do very much help them, as also the fluxes of\r\nblood or humours, as the lask, bloody flux, women’s courses, and stays\r\nall manner of bleeding at the nose, mouth, or any other place, or that\r\ncomes by any bruise or hurt, or bursting a vein; it wonderfully helps\r\nall those inward parts that need consolidating or strengthening, and is\r\nno less effectual both to heal and close green wounds, than to cleanse\r\nand heal all foul or old ulcers, fretting or spreading cankers or the\r\nlike. This herb is of a fine cooling, drying quality, and an ointment\r\nor plaister of it might do a man a courtesy that hath any hot virulent\r\nsores: ’Tis admirable for the ulcers of the French pox; if taken\r\ninwardly, may cure the desease.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FOX-GLOVE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] IT has many long and broad leaves lying upon the ground\r\ndented upon the edges, a little soft or woolly, and of a hoary green\r\ncolour, among which rise up sometimes sundry stalks, but one very\r\noften, bearing such leaves thereon from the bottom to the middle, from\r\nwhence to the top it is stored with large and long hollow reddish\r\npurple flowers, a little more long and eminent at the lower edge, with\r\nsome white spots within them, one above another with small green leaves\r\nat every one, but all of them turning their heads one way, and hanging\r\ndownwards, having some threads also in the middle, from whence rise\r\nround heads, pointed sharp at the ends, wherein small brown seed lies.\r\nThe roots are so many small fibres, and some greater strings among\r\nthem; the flowers have no scent, but the leaves have a bitter hot taste.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows on dry sandy ground for the most part, and as well\r\non the higher as the lower places under hedge-sides in almost every\r\ncounty of this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It seldom flowers before July, and the seed is ripe in August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The plant is under the dominion of Venus,\r\nbeing of a gentle cleansing nature, and withal very friendly to\r\nnature. The herb is familiarly and frequently used by the Italians to\r\nheal any fresh or green wound, the leaves being but bruised and bound\r\nthereon; and the juice thereof is also used in old sores, to cleanse,\r\ndry, and heal them. The decoction hereof made up with some sugar or\r\nhoney, is available to cleanse and purge the body both upwards and\r\ndownwards, sometimes of tough phlegm and clammy humours, and to open\r\nobstructions of the liver and spleen. It has been found by experience\r\nto be available for the king’s evil, the herb bruised and applied, or\r\nan ointment made with the juice thereof, and so used; and a decoction\r\nof two handfuls thereof, with four ounces of Polipody in ale, has been\r\nfound by late experience to cure divers of the falling sickness, that\r\nhave been troubled with it above twenty years. I am confident that an\r\nointment of it is one of the best remedies for scabby head that is.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FUMITORY.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] OUR common Fumitory is a tender sappy herb, sends forth\r\nfrom one square, a slender weak stalk, and leaning downwards on all\r\nsides, many branches two or three feet long, with finely cut and\r\njagged leaves of a whitish or rather blueish sea green colour; At the\r\ntops of the branches stand many small flowers, as it were in a long\r\nspike one above another, made like little birds, of a reddish purple\r\ncolour, whith whitish bellies, after which come small round husks,\r\ncontaining small black seeds. The root is yellow, small, and not very\r\nlong, full of juice while it is green, but quickly perishes with the\r\nripe seed. In the corn fields in Cornwall, it bears white flowers.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in corn fields almost every where, as well as in\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in May, for the most part, and the seed ripens\r\nshortly after.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Saturn owns the herb, and presents it to\r\nthe world as a cure for his own disease, and a strengthener of the\r\nparts of the body he rules. If by my astrological judgment of diseases,\r\nfrom the decumbiture, you find Saturn author of the disease, or if by\r\ndirection from a nativity you fear a saturnine disease approaching,\r\nyou may by this herb prevent it in the one, and cure it in the other,\r\nand therefore it is fit you keep a syrup of it always by you. The\r\njuice or syrup made thereof, or the decoction made in whey by itself,\r\nwith some other purging or opening herbs and roots to cause it to\r\nwork the better (itself being but weak) is very effectual for the\r\nliver and spleen, opening the obstructions thereof, and clarifying the\r\nblood from saltish, choleric, and adust humours, which cause leprosy,\r\nscabs, tetters, and itches, and such like breakings-out of the skin,\r\nand after the purgings doth strengthen all the inwards parts. It is\r\nalso good against the yellow-jaundice, and spends it by urine, which\r\nit procures in abundance. The powder of the dried herb given for some\r\ntime together, cures melancholy, but the seed is strongest in operation\r\nfor all the former diseases. The distilled water of the herb is also\r\nof good effect in the former diseases, and conduces much against the\r\nplague and pestilence, being taken with good treacle. The distilled\r\nwater also, with a little water and honey of roses, helps all sores\r\nof the mouth or throat, being gargled often therewith. The juice\r\ndropped into the eyes, clears the sight and takes away redness and\r\nother defects in them, although it procure some pain for the present,\r\nand cause tears. Dioscorides saith it hinders any fresh springing of\r\nhairs on the eye-lids (after they are pulled away) if the eye-lids be\r\nanointed with the juice hereof, with Gum Arabic dissolved therein. The\r\njuice of the Fumitory and Docks mingled with vinegar, and the places\r\ngently washed therewith, cures all sorts of scabs, pimples, blotches,\r\nwheals, and pushes which arise on the face or hands or any other parts\r\nof the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE FURZE BUSH.\r\n\r\nIT is as well known by this name, as it is in some counties by the\r\nname of Gorz or Whins, that I shall not need to write any description\r\nthereof, my intent being to teach my countrymen what they know not,\r\nrather than to tell them again of that which is generally known before.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They are known to grow on dry barren heaths, and other waste,\r\ngravelly or sandy grounds, in all counties of this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They also flower in the Summer months.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Mars owns the herb. They are hot and dry,\r\nand open obstructions of the liver and spleen. A decoction made with\r\nthe flowers thereof hath been found effectual against the jaundice, as\r\nalso to provoke urine, and cleanse the kidneys from gravel or stone\r\ningendered in them. Mars doth also this by sympathy.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GARLICK.\r\n\r\nTHE offensiveness of the breath of him that hath eaten Garlick, will\r\nlead you by the nose to the knowledge hereof, and (instead of a\r\ndescription) direct you to the place where it grows in gardens, which\r\nkinds are the best, and most physical.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Mars owns this herb. This was anciently\r\naccounted the poor man’s treacle, it being a remedy for all diseases\r\nand hurts (except those which itself breed.) It provokes urine, and\r\nwomen’s courses, helps the biting of mad dogs and other venomous\r\ncreatures, kills worms in children, cuts and voids tough phlegm,\r\npurges the head, helps the lethargy, is a good preservative against,\r\nand a remedy for any plague, sore, or foul ulcers; takes away spots\r\nand blemishes in the skin, eases pains in the ears, ripens and breaks\r\nimposthumes, or other swellings. And for all those diseases the onions\r\nare as effectual. But the Garlick hath some more peculier virtues\r\nbesides the former, _viz._ it hath a special quality to discuss\r\ninconveniences coming by corrupt agues or mineral vapours; or by\r\ndrinking corrupt and stinking waters; as also by taking wolf-bane,\r\nhenbane, hemlock, or other poisonous and dangerous herbs. It is also\r\nheld good in hydropick diseases, the jaundice, falling sickness,\r\ncramps, convulsions, the piles or hæmorrhoids, or other cold diseases.\r\nMany authors quote many diseases this is good for; but conceal its\r\nvices. Its heat is very vehement, and all vehement hot things send\r\nup but ill-favoured vapours to the brain. In coleric men it will add\r\nfuel to the fire; in men oppressed by melancholy, it will attenuate\r\nthe humour, and send up strong fancies, and as many strange visions to\r\nthe head; therefore let it be taken inwardly with great moderation;\r\noutwardly you may make more bold with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GENTIAN, FELWORT, OR BALDMONY.\r\n\r\nIT is confessed that Gentian, which is most used amongst us, is brought\r\nover from beyond sea, yet we have two sorts of it growing frequently\r\nin our nation, which, besides the reasons so frequently alledged why\r\nEnglish herbs should be fittest for English bodies, has been proved by\r\nthe experience of divers physicians, to be not a wit inferior in virtue\r\nto that which comes from beyond sea, therefore be pleased to take the\r\ndescription of them as follows.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The greater of the two hath many small long roots thrust\r\ndown deep into the ground, and abiding all the Winter. The stalks are\r\nsometimes more, sometimes fewer, of a brownish green colour, which is\r\nsometimes two feet high, if the ground be fruitful, having many long,\r\nnarrow, dark green leaves, set by couples up to the top; the flowers\r\nare long and hollow, of a purple colour, ending in fine corners. The\r\nsmaller sort which is to be found in our land, grows up with sundry\r\nstalks, not a foot high, parted into several small branches, whereon\r\ngrow divers small leaves together, very like those of the lesser\r\nCentaury, of a whitish green colour; on the tops of these stalks grow\r\ndivers perfect blue flowers, standing in long husks, but not so big as\r\nthe other; the root is very small, and full of threads.\r\n\r\n_Place._] The first grows in divers places of both the East and West\r\ncounties, and as well in wet as in dry grounds; as near Longfield,\r\nby Gravesend, near Cobham in Kent, near Lillinstone in Kent, also in\r\na chalk pit hard by a paper-mill not far from Dartford in Kent. The\r\nsecond grows also in divers places in Kent, as about Southfleet, and\r\nLongfield; upon Barton’s hills in Bedfordshire; also not far from St.\r\nAlbans, upon a piece of waste chalky ground, as you go out by Dunstable\r\nway towards Gorhambury.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] They are under the dominion of Mars, and\r\none of the principal herbs he is ruler of. They resist putrefactions,\r\npoison, and a more sure remedy cannot be found to prevent the\r\npestilence than it is; it strengthens the stomach exceedingly, helps\r\ndigestion, comforts the heart, and preserves it against faintings and\r\nswoonings: The powder of the dry roots helps the biting of mad dogs\r\nand venomous beasts, opens obstructions of the liver, and restores\r\nan appetite for their meat to such as have lost it. The herb steeped\r\nin wine, and the wine drank, refreshes such as be over-weary with\r\ntraveling, and grow lame in their joints, either by cold or evil\r\nlodgings; it helps stitches, and griping pains in the sides; is an\r\nexcellent remedy for such as are bruised by falls; it provokes urine\r\nand the terms exceedingly, therefore let it not be given to women with\r\nchild: The same is very profitable for such as are troubled with cramps\r\nand convulsions, to drink the decoction: Also they say it breaks the\r\nstone, and helps ruptures most certainly: it is excellent in all cold\r\ndiseases, and such as are troubled with tough phlegm, scabs, itch,\r\nor any fretting sores and ulcers; it is an admirable remedy to kill\r\nthe worms, by taking half a dram of the powder in a morning in any\r\nconvenient liquor; the same is excellently good to be taken inwardly\r\nfor the king’s evil. It helps agues of all sorts, and the yellow\r\njaundice, as also the bots in cattle; when kine are bitten on the udder\r\nby any venomous beast, do but stroke the place with the decoction of\r\nany of these, and it will instantly heal them.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CLOVE GILLIFLOWERS.\r\n\r\nIT is vain to describe an herb so well known.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] They are gallant, fine, temperate flowers,\r\nof the nature and under the dominion of Jupiter; yea, so temperate,\r\nthat no excess, neither in heat, cold, dryness, nor moisture, can be\r\nperceived in them; they are great strengtheners both of the brain and\r\nheart, and will therefore serve either for cordials or cephalics, as\r\nyour occasion will serve. There is both a syrup and a conserve made of\r\nthem alone, commonly to be had at every apothecary’s. To take now and\r\nthen a little of either, strengthens nature much, in such as are in\r\nconsumptions. They are also excellently good in hot pestilent fevers,\r\nand expel poison.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GERMANDER.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] COMMON Germander shoots forth sundry stalks, with small\r\nand somewhat round leaves, dented about the edges. The flowers\r\nstand at the tops of a deep purple colour. The root is composed of\r\ndivers sprigs, which shoots forth a great way round about, quickly\r\noverspreading a garden.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows usually with us in gardens.\r\n\r\n_Time._] And flowers in June and July.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a most prevalent herb of Mercury,\r\nand strengthens the brain and apprehension exceedingly when weak, and\r\nrelieves them when drooping. This taken with honey (saith Dioscorides)\r\nis a remedy for coughs, hardness of the spleen and difficulty of urine,\r\nand helps those that are fallen into a dropsy, especially at the\r\nbeginning of the disease, a decoction being made thereof when it is\r\ngreen, and drank. It also brings down women’s courses, and expels the\r\ndead child. It is most effectual against the poison of all serpents,\r\nbeing drank in wine, and the bruised herb outwardly applied; used with\r\nhoney, it cleanses old and foul ulcers; and made into an oil, and the\r\neyes anointed therewith, takes away the dimness and moistness. It is\r\nlikewise good for the pains in the sides and cramps. The decoction\r\nthereof taken for four days together, drives away and cures both\r\ntertain and quartan agues. It is also good against all diseases of the\r\nbrain, as continual head-ache, falling-sickness, melancholy, drowsiness\r\nand dullness of the spirits, convulsions and palsies. A dram of the\r\nseed taken in powder purges by urine, and is good against the yellow\r\njaundice. The juice of the leaves dropped into the ears kills the\r\nworms in them. The tops thereof, when they are in flowers, steeped\r\ntwenty-four hours in a draught of white wine, and drank, kills the\r\nworms in the belly.\r\n\r\n\r\n    STINKING GLADWIN.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS is one of the kinds of Flower-de-luce, having\r\ndivers leaves arising from the roots, very like a Flower-de-luce, but\r\nthat they are sharp-edged on both sides, and thicker in the middle,\r\nof a deeper green colour narrower and sharper pointed, and a strong\r\nill-scent, if they be bruised between the fingers. In the middle\r\nrises up a reasonably strong stalk, a yard high at least, bearing\r\nthree or four flowers at the top, made somewhat like the flowers of\r\nthe Flower-de-luce, with three upright leaves, of a dead purplish\r\nash-colour, with some veins discoloured in them; the other three do not\r\nfall down, nor are the three other small ones so arched, nor cover the\r\nlower leaves as the Flower-de-luce doth, but stand loose or asunder\r\nfrom them. After they are past, there come up three square hard husks,\r\nopening wide into three parts when they are ripe, wherein lie reddish\r\nseed, turns black when it hath abiden long. The root is like that of\r\nthe Flower-de-luce, but reddish on the outside, and whitish within,\r\nvery sharp and hot in the taste, of as evil a scent as the leaves.\r\n\r\n_Place._] This grows as well in upland grounds, as in moist places,\r\nwoods, and shadowy places by the sea-side in many places of this land,\r\nand is usually nursed up in gardens.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers not until July, and the seed is ripe in August or\r\nSeptember, yet the husks after they are ripe, opening themselves, will\r\nhold their seed with them for two or three months, and not shed them.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is supposed to be under the dominion of\r\nSaturn. It is used by many country people to purge corrupt phlegm and\r\ncholer, which they do by drinking the decoction of the roots; and some\r\nto make it more gentle, do but infuse the sliced roots in ale; and some\r\ntake the leaves, which serve well for the weaker stomach: The juice\r\nhereof put up, or snuffed up the nose, causes sneezing, and draws from\r\nthe head much corruption; and the powder thereof doth the same. The\r\npowder thereof drank in wine, helps those that are troubled with the\r\ncramps and convulsions, or with the gout and sciatica, and gives ease\r\nto those that have griping pains in their body and belly, and helps\r\nthose that have the stranguary. It is given with much profit to those\r\nthat have had long fluxes by the sharp and evil quality of humours,\r\nwhich it stays, having first cleansed and purged them by the drying\r\nand binding property therein. The root boiled in wine and drank, doth\r\neffectually procure women’s courses, and used as a pessary, works the\r\nsame effect, but causes abortion in women with child. Half a dram of\r\nthe seed beaten to powder, and taken in wine, doth speedily cause one\r\nto make water abundantly. The same taken with vinegar, dissolves the\r\nhardness and swellings of the spleen. The root is very effectual in all\r\nwounds, especially of the head; as also to draw forth any splinters,\r\nthorns, or broken bones, or any other thing sticking in the flesh,\r\nwithout causing pains, being used with a little verdigrease and honey,\r\nand the great Centaury root. The same boiled in vinegar, and laid upon\r\nan eruption or swelling, doth very effectually dissolve and consume\r\nthem; yea, even the swellings of the throat called the king’s evil;\r\nthe juice of the leaves or roots heals the itch, and all running or\r\nspreading scabs, sores, blemishes, or scars in the skin, wheresoever\r\nthey be.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GOLDEN ROD.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS rises up with brownish small round stalks, two feet\r\nhigh, and sometimes more, having thereon many narrow and long dark\r\ngreen leaves, very seldom with any dents about the edges, or any stalks\r\nor white spots therein, yet they are sometimes so found divided at the\r\ntops into many small branches, with divers small yellow flowers on\r\nevery one of them, all which are turned one way, and being ripe, do\r\nturn into down, and are carried away by the wind. The root consists of\r\nmany small fibres, which grows not deep in the ground, but abides all\r\nthe winter therein, shooting forth new branches every year, the old one\r\nlying down to the ground.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in the open places of woods and copses, on both\r\nmoist and dry grounds, in many places of this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers about the month of July.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Venus claims the herb, and therefore to\r\nbe sure it respects beauty lost. Arnoldus de Villa Nova commends it\r\nmuch against the stone in the reins and kidneys, and to provoke urine\r\nin abundance, whereby also the gravel and stone may be voided. The\r\ndecoction of the herb, green or dry, or the distilled water thereof,\r\nis very effectual for inward bruises, as also to be outwardly applied,\r\nit stays bleeding in any part of the body, and of wounds; also the\r\nfluxes of humours, the bloody-flux, and women’s courses; and is no\r\nless prevalent in all ruptures or burstings, being drank inwardly, and\r\noutwardly applied. It is a sovereign wound herb, inferior to none,\r\nboth for the inward and outward hurts; green wounds, old sores and\r\nulcers, are quickly cured therewith. It also is of especial use in all\r\nlotions for sores or ulcers in the mouth, throat, or privy parts of man\r\nor woman. The decoction also helps to fasten the teeth that are loose\r\nin the gums.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GOUT-WORT, OR HERB GERRARD.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] IT is a low herb, seldom rising half a yard high, having\r\nsundry leaves standing on brownish green stalks by three, snipped\r\nabout, and of a strong unpleasant savour: The umbels of the flowers\r\nare white, and the seed blackish, the root runs in the ground, quickly\r\ntaking a great deal of room.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows by hedge and wall-sides, and often in the border and\r\ncorner of fields, and in gardens also.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers and seeds about the end of July.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Saturn rules it. Neither is it to be supposed\r\nGout-wort hath its name for nothing but upon experiment to heal the\r\ngout and sciatica; as also joint-aches, and other cold griefs. The very\r\nbearing of it about one eases the pains of the gout, and defends him\r\nthat bears it from the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GROMEL.\r\n\r\nOF this I shall briefly describe their kinds, which are principally\r\nused in physic, the virtues whereof are alike, though somewhat\r\ndifferent in their manner and form of growing.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The greater Gromel grows up with slender hard and hairy\r\nstalks, trailing and taking root in the ground, as it lies thereon,\r\nand parted into many other small branches with hairy dark green leaves\r\nthereon. At the joints, with the leaves, come forth very small blue\r\nflowers, and after them hard stony roundish seed. The root is long and\r\nwoody, abiding the Winter, and shoots forth fresh stalks in the spring.\r\n\r\nThe smaller wild Gromel sends forth divers upright hard branched\r\nstalks, two or three feet high full of joints, at every one of which\r\ngrow small, long, hard, and rough leaves like the former, but less;\r\namong which leaves come forth small white flowers, and after them\r\ngreyish round seed like the former; the root is not very big, but with\r\nmany strings thereat.\r\n\r\nThe garden Gromel as divers upright, slender, woody, hairy stalks,\r\nblown and cressed, very little branched, with leaves like the former,\r\nand white flowers; after which, in rough brown husks, is contained a\r\nwhite, hard, round seed, shining like pearls, and greater than either\r\nthe former; the root is like the first described, with divers branches\r\nand sprigs thereat, which continues (as the first doth) all the Winter.\r\n\r\n_Place._] The two first grow wild in barren or untilled places, and by\r\nthe way side in many places of this land. The last is a nursling in the\r\ngardens of the curious.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They all flower from Midsummer until September sometimes, and\r\nin the mean time the seed ripens.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The herb belongs to Dame Venus; and\r\ntherefore if Mars cause the cholic or stone, as usually he doth, if\r\nin Virgo, this is your cure. These are accounted to be of as singular\r\nforce as any herb or seed whatsoever, to break the stone and to void\r\nit, and the gravel either in the reins or bladder, as also to provoke\r\nurine being stopped, and to help stranguary. The seed is of greatest\r\nuse, being bruised and boiled in white wine or in broth, or the like,\r\nor the powder of the seed taken therein. Two drams of the seed in\r\npowder taken with women’s breast milk, is very effectual to procure a\r\nvery speedy delivery to such women as have sore pains in their travail,\r\nand cannot be delivered: The herb itself, (when the seed is not to be\r\nhad) either boiled, or the juice thereof drank, is effectual to all\r\nthe purposes aforesaid, but not so powerful or speedy in operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GOOSEBERRY BUSH.\r\n\r\nCALLED also Feapberry, and in Sussex Dewberry-Bush, and in some\r\nCounties Wineberry.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] They are under the dominion of Venus. The\r\nberries, while they are unripe, being scalded or baked, are good to\r\nstir up a fainting or decayed appetite, especially such whose stomachs\r\nare afflicted by choleric humours: They are excellently good to stay\r\nlongings of women with child. You may keep them preserved with sugar\r\nall the year long. The decoction of the leaves of the tree cools hot\r\ndwellings and inflammations; as also St. Anthony’s fire. The ripe\r\nGooseberries being eaten, are an excellent remedy to allay the violent\r\nheat both of the stomach and liver. The young and tender leaves break\r\nthe stone, and expel gravel both from the kidneys and bladder. All\r\nthe evil they do to the body of man is, they are supposed to breed\r\ncrudities, and by crudities, worms.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WINTER-GREEN.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS sends forth seven, eight, or nine leaves from a small\r\nbrown creeping root, every one standing upon a long foot stalk, which\r\nare almost as broad as long, round pointed, of a sad green colour, and\r\nhard in handling, and like the leaf of a Pear-tree; from whence arises\r\na slender weak stalk, yet standing upright, bearing at the top many\r\nsmall white sweet-smelling flowers, laid open like a star, consisting\r\nof five round pointed leaves, with many yellow threads standing in the\r\nmiddle about a green head, and a long stalk with them, which in time\r\ngrows to be the seed-vessel, which being ripe is found five square,\r\nwith a small point at it, wherein is contained seed as small as dust.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows seldom in fields, but frequent in the woods\r\nnorthwards, _viz._ in Yorkshire, Lancashire, and Scotland.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers about June and July.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Winter-green is under the dominion of\r\nSaturn, and is a singularly good wound herb, and an especial remedy\r\nfor healing green wounds speedily, the green leaves being bruised\r\nand applied, or the juice of them. A salve made of the green herb\r\nstamped, or the juice boiled with hog’s lard, or with salad oil and\r\nwax, and some turpentine added to it, is a sovereign salve, and highly\r\nextolled by the Germans, who use it to heal all manner of wounds and\r\nsores. The herb boiled in wine and water, and given to drink to them\r\nthat have any inward ulcers in their kidneys, or neck of the bladder,\r\ndoth wonderfully help them. It stays all fluxes, as the lask, bloody\r\nfluxes, women’s courses, and bleeding of wounds, and takes away any\r\ninflammations rising upon pains of the heart; it is no less helpful\r\nfor foul ulcers hard to be cured; as also for cankers or fistulas. The\r\ndistilled water of the herb effectually performs the same things.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GROUNDSEL.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] OUR common Groundsel has a round green and somewhat\r\nbrownish stalk, spreading toward the top into branches, set with long\r\nand somewhat narrow green leaves, cut in on the edges, somewhat like\r\nthe oak-leaves, but less, and round at the end. At the tops of the\r\nbranches stand many small green heads, out of which grow several small,\r\nyellow threads or thumbs, which are the flowers, and continue many days\r\nblown in that manner, before it pass away into down, and with the seed\r\nis carried away in the wind. The root is small and thready, and soon\r\nperishes, and as soon rises again of its own sowing, so that it may be\r\nseen many months in the year both green and in flower, and seed; for it\r\nwill spring and seed twice in a year at least, if it be suffered in a\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow almost every where, as well on tops of walls, as\r\nat the foot amongst rubbish and untilled grounds, but especially in\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers, as was said before, almost every month throughout\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] This herb is Venus’s mistress-piece, and is\r\nas gallant and universal a medicine for all diseases coming of heat,\r\nin what part of the body soever they be, as the sun shines upon; it\r\nis very safe and friendly to the body of man: yet causes vomiting if\r\nthe stomach be afflicted; if not, purging: and it doth it with more\r\ngentleness than can be expected; it is moist, and something cold\r\nwithal, thereby causing expulsion, and repressing the heat caused\r\nby the motion of the internal parts in purges and vomits. Lay by\r\nour learned receipts; take so much Sena, so much Scammony, so much\r\nColocynthis, so much infusion of Crocus Metallorum, &c. this herb alone\r\npreserved in a syrup, in a distilled water, or in an ointment, shall do\r\nthe deed for you in all hot diseases, and, shall do it, 1, Safely; 2,\r\nSpeedily.\r\n\r\nThe decoction of this herb (saith Dioscorides) made with wine, and\r\ndrank, helps the pains of the stomach, proceeding of choler, (which it\r\nmay well do by a vomit) as daily experience shews. The juice thereof\r\ntaken in drink, or the decoction of it in ale, gently performs the\r\nsame. It is good against the jaundice and falling sickness, being\r\ntaken in wine; as also against difficulty of making water. It provokes\r\nurine, expels gravel in the reins or kidneys; a dram thereof given\r\nin oxymel, after some walking or stirring of the body. It helps also\r\nthe sciatica, griping of the belly, the cholic, defects of the liver,\r\nand provokes women’s courses. The fresh herb boiled and made into\r\na poultice, applied to the breasts of women that are swollen with\r\npain and heat, as also the privy parts of man or woman, the seat or\r\nfundament, or the arteries, joints, and sinews, when they are inflamed\r\nand swollen, doth much ease them; and used with some salt, helps to\r\ndissolve knots or kernels in any part of the body. The juice of the\r\nherb, or as (Dioscorides saith) the leaves and flowers, with some fine\r\nFrankincense in powder, used in wounds of the body, nerves or sinews,\r\ndoth singularly help to heal them. The distilled water of the herb\r\nperforms well all the aforesaid cures, but especially for inflammations\r\nor watering of the eyes, by reason of the defluxion of rheum unto them.\r\n\r\n\r\n    HEART’S-EASE.\r\n\r\nTHIS is that herb which such physicians as are licensed to blaspheme by\r\nauthority, without danger of having their tongues burned through with\r\nan hot iron, called an herb of the Trinity. It is also called by those\r\nthat are more moderate, Three Faces in a Hood, Live in Idleness, Cull\r\nme to you; and in Sussex we call them Pancies.\r\n\r\n_Place._] Besides those which are brought up in gardens, they grow\r\ncommonly wild in the fields, especially in such as are very barren:\r\nsometimes you may find it on the tops of the high hills.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower all the Spring and Summer long.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The herb is really saturnine, something\r\ncold, viscous, and slimy. A strong decoction of the herbs and flowers\r\n(if you will, you may make it into syrup) is an excellent cure for\r\nthe French pox, the herb being a gallant antivenereal: and that\r\nantivenereals are the best cure for that disease, far better and safer\r\nthan to torment them with the flux, divers foreign physicians have\r\nconfessed. The spirit of it is excellently good for the convulsions in\r\nchildren, as also for the falling sickness, and a gallant remedy for\r\nthe inflammation of the lungs and breasts, pleurisy, scabs, itch, &c.\r\nIt is under the celestial sign Cancer.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ARTICHOKES.\r\n\r\nTHE Latins call them Cinera, only our college calls them Artichocus.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] They are under the dominion of Venus, and\r\ntherefore it is no marvel if they provoke lust, as indeed they do,\r\nbeing somewhat windy meat; and yet they stay the involuntary course of\r\nnatural seed in man, which is commonly called nocturnal pollutions. And\r\nhere I care not greatly if I quote a little of Galen’s nonsense in his\r\ntreatise of the faculties of nourishment. He saith, they contain plenty\r\nof choleric juice, (which notwithstanding I can scarcely believe,) of\r\nwhich he saith is engendered melancholy juice, and of that melancholy\r\njuice thin choleric blood. But, to proceed; this is certain, that the\r\ndecoction of the root boiled in wine, or the root bruised and distilled\r\nin wine in an alembic, and being drank, purges by urine exceedingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n    HART’S-TONGUE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS has divers leaves arising from the root, every\r\none severally, which fold themselves in their first springing and\r\nspreading: when they are full grown, are about a foot long, smooth and\r\ngreen above, but hard and with little sap in them, and streaked on the\r\nback, athwart on both sides of the middle rib, with small and somewhat\r\nlong and brownish marks; the bottoms of the leaves are a little bowed\r\non each side of the middle rib, somewhat small at the end. The root is\r\nof many black threads, folded or interlaced together.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It is green all the Winter; but new leaves spring every year.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Jupiter claims dominion over this herb,\r\ntherefore it is a singular remedy for the liver, both to strengthen it\r\nwhen weak, and ease it when afflicted, you shall do well to keep it\r\nin a syrup all the year; For though authors say it is green all the\r\nyear, I scarcely believe it. Hart’s Tongue is much commended against\r\nthe hardness and stoppings of the spleen and liver, and against the\r\nheat of the liver and stomach, and against lasks, and the bloody-flux.\r\nThe distilled water thereof is also very good against the passions\r\nof the heart, and to stay the hiccough, to help the falling of the\r\npalate, and to stay the bleeding of the gums, being gargled in the\r\nmouth. Dioscorides saith, it is good against the stinging or biting of\r\nserpents. As for the use of it, my direction at the latter end will be\r\nsufficient, and enough for those that are studious in physic, to whet\r\ntheir brains upon for one year or two.\r\n\r\n\r\n    HAZEL-NUT.\r\n\r\nHAZEL Nuts are so well known to every body, that they need no\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] They are under the dominion of Mercury.\r\nThe parted kernels made into an electuary, or the milk drawn from the\r\nkernels with mead or honeyed water, is very good to help an old cough;\r\nand being parched, and a little pepper put to them and drank, digests\r\nthe distillations of rheum from the head. The dried husks and shells,\r\nto the weight of two drams, taken in red wine, stays lasks and women’s\r\ncourses, and so doth the red skin that covers the kernels, which is\r\nmore effectual to stay women’s courses.\r\n\r\nAnd if this be true, as it is, then why should the vulgar so familiarly\r\naffirm, that eating nuts causes shortness of breath, than which nothing\r\nis falser? For, how can that which strengthens the lungs, cause\r\nshortness of breath? I confess, the opinion is far older than I am; I\r\nknew tradition was a friend to error before, but never that he was\r\nthe father of slander; Or are men’s tongues so given to slander one\r\nanother, that they must slander Nuts too, to keep their tongues in use?\r\nIf any part of the Hazel Nut be stopping, it is the husks and shells,\r\nand no one is so mad as to eat them unless physically; and the red skin\r\nwhich covers the kernel, you may easily pull off And so thus have I\r\nmade an apology for Nuts, which cannot speak for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n    HAWK-WEED.\r\n\r\nTHERE are several sorts of Hawk-weed, but they are similar in virtues.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] It has many large leaves lying upon the ground, much rent\r\nor torn on the sides into gashes like Dandelion, but with greater\r\nparts, more like the smooth Sow Thistle, from among which rises a\r\nhollow, rough stalk, two or three feet high, branched from the middle\r\nupward, whereon are set at every joint longer leaves, little or nothing\r\nrent or cut, bearing on them sundry pale, yellow flowers, consisting of\r\nmany small, narrow leaves, broad pointed, and nicked in at the ends,\r\nset in a double row or more, the outermost being larger than the inner,\r\nwhich form most of the Hawk-weeds (for there are many kinds of them) do\r\nhold, which turn into down, and with the small brownish seed is blown\r\naway with the wind. The root is long and somewhat great, with many\r\nsmall fibres thereat. The whole plant is full of bitter-milk.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in divers places about the field sides, and the\r\npath-ways in dry grounds.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers and flies away in the Summer months.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Saturn owns it. Hawk-weed (saith\r\nDioscorides) is cooling, somewhat drying and binding, and therefore\r\ngood for the heat of the stomach, and gnawings therein; for\r\ninflammations and the hot fits of agues. The juice thereof in wine,\r\nhelps digestion, discusses wind, hinders crudities abiding in the\r\nstomach, and helps the difficulty of making water, the biting of\r\nvenomous serpents, and stinging of the scorpion, if the herb be also\r\noutwardly applied to the place, and is very good against all other\r\npoisons. A scruple of the dried root given in wine and vinegar, is\r\nprofitable for those that have the dropsy. The decoction of the herb\r\ntaken in honey, digests the phlegm in the chest or lungs, and with\r\nHyssop helps the cough. The decoction thereof, and of wild Succory,\r\nmade with wine, and taken, helps the wind cholic and hardness of the\r\nspleen; it procures rest and sleep, hinders venery and venerous dreams,\r\ncooling heats, purges the stomach, increases blood, and helps the\r\ndiseases of the reins and bladder. Outwardly applied, it is singularly\r\ngood for all the defects and diseases of the eyes, used with some\r\nwomen’s milk; and used with good success in fretting or creeping\r\nulcers, especially in the beginning. The green leaves bruised, and with\r\na little salt applied to any place burnt with fire, before blisters\r\ndo rise, helps them; as also inflammations, St. Anthony’s fire, and\r\nall pushes and eruptions, hot and salt phlegm. The same applied with\r\nmeal and fair water in manner of a poultice, to any place affected\r\nwith convulsions, the cramp, and such as are out of joint, doth give\r\nhelp and ease. The distilled water cleanses the skin, and takes away\r\nfreckles, spots, morphew, or wrinkles in the face.\r\n\r\n\r\n    HAWTHORN.\r\n\r\nIT is not my intention to trouble you with a description of this tree,\r\nwhich is so well known that it needs none. It is ordinarily but a\r\nhedge bush, although being pruned and dressed, it grows to a tree of a\r\nreasonable height.\r\n\r\nAs for the Hawthorn Tree at Glastonbury, which is said to flower\r\nyearly on Christmas-day, it rather shews the superstition of those\r\nthat observe it for the time of its flowering, than any great wonder,\r\nsince the like may be found in divers other places of this land; as in\r\nWhey-street in Romney Marsh, and near unto Nantwich in Cheshire, by a\r\nplace called White Green, where it flowers about Christmas and May. If\r\nthe weather be frosty, it flowers not until January, or that the hard\r\nweather be over.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a tree of Mars. The seeds in the\r\nberries beaten to powder being drank in wine, are held singularly good\r\nagainst the stone, and are good for the dropsy. The distilled water\r\nof the flowers stay the lask. The seed cleared from the down, bruised\r\nand boiled in wine, and drank, is good for inward tormenting pains. If\r\ncloths or sponges be wet in the distilled water, and applied to any\r\nplace wherein thorns and splinters, or the like, do abide in the flesh,\r\nit will notably draw them forth.\r\n\r\nAnd thus you see the thorn gives a medicine for its own pricking, and\r\nso doth almost every thing else.\r\n\r\n\r\n    HEMLOCK.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THE common great Hemlock grows up with a green stalk, four\r\nor five feet high, or more, full of red spots sometimes, and at the\r\njoints very large winged leaves set at them, which are divided into\r\nmany other winged leaves, one set against the other, dented about the\r\nedges, of a sad green colour, branched towards the top, where it is\r\nfull of umbels of white flowers, and afterwards with whitish flat seed:\r\nThe root is long, white, and sometimes crooked, and hollow within. The\r\nwhole plant, and every part, has a strong, heady, and ill-savoured\r\nscent, much offending the senses.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in all counties of this land, by walls and\r\nhedge-sides, in waste grounds and untilled places.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers and seeds in July, or thereabouts.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Saturn claims dominion over this herb, yet\r\nI wonder why it may not be applied to the privities in a Priapism,\r\nor continual standing of the yard, it being very beneficial to that\r\ndisease; I suppose, my author’s judgment was first upon the opposite\r\ndisposition of Saturn to Venus in those faculties, and therefore he\r\nforbade the applying of it to those parts, that it might not cause\r\nbarrenness, or spoil the spirit procreative; which if it do, yet\r\napplied to the privities, it stops its lustful thoughts. Hemlock is\r\nexceedingly cold, and very dangerous, especially to be taken inwardly.\r\nIt may safely be applied to inflammations, tumours, and swellings in\r\nany part of the body (save the privy parts) as also to St. Anthony’s\r\nfire, wheals, pushes, and creeping ulcers that arise of hot sharp\r\nhumours, by cooling and repelling the heat; the leaves bruised and\r\nlaid to the brow or forehead are good for their eyes that are red and\r\nswollen; as also to take away a pin and web growing in the eye; this\r\nis a tried medicine: Take a small handful of this herb, and half so\r\nmuch bay salt, beaten together, and applied to the contrary wrist of\r\nthe hand, for 24 hours, doth remove it in thrice dressing. If the root\r\nthereof be roasted under the embers, wrapped in double wet paper, until\r\nit be soft and tender, and then applied to the gout in the hands or\r\nfingers, it will quickly help this evil. If any through mistake eat\r\nthe herb Hemlock instead of Parsley, or the roots instead of a Parsnip\r\n(both of which it is very like) whereby happens a kind of frenzy, or\r\nperturbation of the senses, as if they were stupid and drunk, the\r\nremedy is (as Pliny saith) to drink of the best and strongest pure\r\nwine, before it strikes to the heart, or Gentian put in wine, or a\r\ndraught of vinegar, wherewith Tragus doth affirm, that he cured a woman\r\nthat had eaten the root.\r\n\r\n\r\n    HEMP.\r\n\r\nTHIS is so well known to every good housewife in the country, that I\r\nshall not need to write any description of it.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It is sown in the very end of March, or beginning of April,\r\nand is ripe in August or September.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a plant of Saturn, and good for\r\nsomething else, you see, than to make halters only. The seed of Hemp\r\nconsumes wind, and by too much use thereof disperses it so much that\r\nit dries up the natural seed for procreation; yet, being boiled in\r\nmilk and taken, helps such as have a hot dry cough. The Dutch make an\r\nemulsion out of the seed, and give it with good success to those that\r\nhave the jaundice, especially in the beginning of the disease, if there\r\nbe no ague accompanying it, for it opens obstructions of the gall,\r\nand causes digestion of choler. The emulsion or decoction of the seed\r\nstays lasks and continual fluxes, eases the cholic, and allays the\r\ntroublesome humours in the bowels, and stays bleeding at the mouth,\r\nnose, or other places, some of the leaves being fried with the blood\r\nof them that bleed, and so given them to eat. It is held very good to\r\nkill the worms in men or beasts; and the juice dropped into the ears\r\nkills worms in them; and draws forth earwigs, or other living creatures\r\ngotten into them. The decoction of the root allays inflammations of\r\nthe head, or any other parts: the herb itself, or the distilled water\r\nthereof doth the like. The decoction of the root eases the pains of the\r\ngout, the hard humours of knots in the joints, the pains and shrinking\r\nof the sinews, and the pains of the hips. The fresh juice mixed with a\r\nlittle oil and butter, is good for any place that hath been burnt with\r\nfire, being thereto applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n    HENBANE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] OUR common Henbane has very large, thick, soft, woolly\r\nleaves, lying on the ground, much cut in, or torn on the edges, of\r\na dark, ill greyish green colour; among which arise up divers thick\r\nand short stalks, two or three feet high, spread into divers small\r\nbranches, with lesser leaves on them, and many hollow flowers, scarce\r\nappearing above the husk, and usually torn on one side, ending in five\r\nround points, growing one above another, of a deadish yellowish colour,\r\nsomewhat paler towards the edges, with many purplish veins therein,\r\nand of a dark, yellowish purple in the bottom of the flower, with a\r\nsmall point of the same colour in the middle, each of them standing in\r\na hard close husk, which after the flowers are past, grow very like\r\nthe husk of Asarabacca, and somewhat sharp at the top points, wherein\r\nis contained much small seed, very like Poppy seed, but of a dusky,\r\ngreyish colour. The root is great, white, and thick, branching forth\r\ndivers ways under ground, so like a Parsnip root (but that it is not so\r\nwhite) that it has deceived others. The whole plant more than the root,\r\nhas a very heavy, ill, soporiferous smell, somewhat offensive.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It commonly grows by the way-sides, and under hedge-sides and\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in July, and springs again yearly of its own seed.\r\nI doubt my authors mistook July for June, if not for May.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] I wonder how astrologers could take on\r\nthem to make this an herb of Jupiter; and yet Mizaldus, a man of\r\na penetrating brain, was of that opinion as well as the rest; the\r\nherb is indeed under the dominion of Saturn, and I prove it by this\r\nargument: All the herbs which delight most to grow in saturnine places,\r\nare saturnine herbs. Both Henbane delights most to grow in saturnine\r\nplaces, and whole cart loads of it may be found near the places where\r\nthey empty the common Jakes, and scarce a ditch to be found without it\r\ngrowing by it. Ergo, it is an herb of Saturn. The leaves of Henbane do\r\ncool all hot inflammations in the eyes, or any other part of the body;\r\nand are good to assuage all manner of swellings of the privities, or\r\nwomen’s breast, or elsewhere, if they be boiled in wine, and either\r\napplied themselves, or the fomentation warm; it also assuages the pain\r\nof the gout, the sciatica, and other pains in the joints which arise\r\nfrom a hot cause. And applied with vinegar to the forehead and temples,\r\nhelps the head-ache and want of sleep in hot fevers. The juice of the\r\nherb or seed, or the oil drawn from the seed, does the like. The oil\r\nof the seed is helpful for deafness, noise, and worms in the ears,\r\nbeing dropped therein; the juice of the herb or root doth the same. The\r\ndecoction of the herb or seed, or both, kills lice in man or beast.\r\nThe fume of the dried herb, stalks and seed, burned, quickly heals\r\nswellings, chilblains or kibes in the hands or feet, by holding them in\r\nthe fume thereof. The remedy to help those that have taken Henbane is\r\nto drink goat’s milk, honeyed water, or pine kernels, with sweet wine;\r\nor, in the absence of these, Fennel seed, Nettle seed, the seed of\r\nCresses, Mustard, or Radish; as also Onions or Garlic taken in wine, do\r\nall help to free them from danger, and restore them to their due temper\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nTake notice, that this herb must never be taken inwardly; outwardly,\r\nan oil ointment, or plaister of it, is most admirable for the\r\ngout, to cool the veneral heat of the reins in the French pox; to\r\nstop the toothache, being applied to the aching side: to allay all\r\ninflammations, and to help the diseases before premised.\r\n\r\n\r\n    HEDGE HYSSOP.\r\n\r\nDIVERS sorts there are of this plant; the first of which is an Italian\r\nby birth, and only nursed up here in the gardens of the curious. Two\r\nor three sorts are found commonly growing wild here, the description of\r\ntwo of which I shall give you.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The first is a smooth, low plant, not a foot high, very\r\nbitter in taste, with many square stalks, diversly branched from the\r\nbottom to the top, with divers joints, and two small leaves at each\r\njoint, broader at the bottom than they are at the end, a little dented\r\nabout the edges, of a sad green colour, and full of veins. The flowers\r\nstand at the joints, being of a fair purple colour, with some white\r\nspots in them, in fashion like those of dead nettles. The seed is small\r\nand yellow, and the roots spread much under ground.\r\n\r\nThe second seldom grows half a foot high, sending up many small\r\nbranches, whereon grow many small leaves, set one against the other,\r\nsomewhat broad, but very short. The flowers are like the flowers of the\r\nother fashion, but of a pale reddish colour. The seeds are small and\r\nyellowish. The root spreads like the other, neither will it yield to\r\nits fellow one ace of bitterness.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow in wet low grounds, and by the water-sides; the\r\nlast may be found among the bogs on Hampstead Heath.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in June or July, and the seed is ripe presently\r\nafter.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] They are herbs of Mars, and as choleric and\r\nchurlish as he is, being most violent purges, especially of choler\r\nand phlegm. It is not safe taking them inwardly, unless they be well\r\nrectified by the art of the alchymist, and only the purity of them\r\ngiven; so used they may be very helpful both for the dropsy, gout,\r\nand sciatica; outwardly used in ointments they kill worms, the belly\r\nanointed with it, and are excellently good to cleanse old and filthy\r\nulcers.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BLACK HELLEBORE.\r\n\r\nIT is also called Setter-wort, Setter-grass, Bear’s-foot,\r\nChristmas-herb, and Christmas-flowers.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] It hath sundry fair green leaves rising from the root,\r\neach of them standing about an handful high from the earth; each leaf\r\nis divided into seven, eight, or nine parts, dented from the middle\r\nof the leaf to the point on both sides, abiding green all the Winter;\r\nabout Christmas-time, if the weather be any thing temperate, the\r\nflowers appear upon foot stalks, also consisting of five large, round,\r\nwhite leaves a-piece, which sometimes are purple towards the edges,\r\nwith many pale yellow thumbs in the middle; the seeds are divided\r\ninto several cells, like those of Columbines, save only that they are\r\ngreater; the seeds are in colour black, and in form long and round. The\r\nroot consists of numberless blackish strings all united into one head.\r\nThere is another Black Hellebore, which grows up and down in the woods\r\nvery like this, but only that the leaves are smaller and narrower, and\r\nperish in the Winter, which this doth not.\r\n\r\n_Place._] The first is maintained in gardens. The second is commonly\r\nfound in the woods in Northamptonshire.\r\n\r\n_Time._] The first flowers in December or January; the second in\r\nFebruary or March.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of Saturn, and therefore no\r\nmarvel if it has some sullen conditions with it, and would be far\r\nsafer, being purified by the art of the alchymist than given raw. If\r\nany have taken any harm by taking it, the common cure is to take goat’s\r\nmilk: If you cannot get goat’s milk, you must make a shift with such\r\nas you can get. The roots are very effectual against all melancholy\r\ndiseases, especially such as are of long standing, as quartan agues and\r\nmadness; it helps the falling sickness, the leprosy, both the yellow\r\nand black jaundice, the gout, sciatica, and convulsions; and this was\r\nfound out by experience, that the root of that which grows wild in our\r\ncountry, works not so churlishly as those do which are brought from\r\nbeyond sea, as being maintained by a more temperate air. The root used\r\nas a pessary, provokes the terms exceedingly; also being beaten into\r\npowder, and strewed upon foul ulcers, it consumes the dead flesh, and\r\ninstantly heals them; nay, it will help gangrenes in the beginning.\r\nTwenty grains taken inwardly is a sufficient dose for one time, and\r\nlet that be corrected with half so much cinnamon; country people used\r\nto rowel their cattle with it. If a beast be troubled with a cough,\r\nor have taken any poison, they bore a hole through the ear, and put\r\na piece of the root in it, this will help him in 24 hours time. Many\r\nother uses farriers put it to which I shall forbear.\r\n\r\n\r\n    HERB ROBERT.\r\n\r\nTHE Herb Robert is held in great estimation by farmers, who use it in\r\ndiseases of their cattle.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] It rises up with a reddish stalk two feet high, having\r\ndivers leaves thereon, upon very long and reddish foot-stalks, divided\r\nat the ends into three or five divisions, each of them cut in on\r\nthe edges, which sometimes turn reddish. At the tops of the stalks\r\ncome forth divers flowers made of five leaves, much larger than the\r\nDove’s-foot, and of a more reddish colour; after which come black\r\nheads, as in others. The root is small and thready, and smells, as the\r\nwhole plant, very strong, almost stinking.\r\n\r\n_Place._] This grows frequently every where by the way-sides, upon\r\nditch banks and waste grounds wheresoever one goes.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in June and July chiefly, and the seed is ripe\r\nshortly after.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of Venus. Herb\r\nRobert is commended not only against the stone, but to stay blood,\r\nwhere or howsoever flowing, it speedily heals all green wounds, and\r\nis effectual in old ulcers in the privy parts, or elsewhere. You may\r\npersuade yourself this is true, and also conceive a good reason for it,\r\ndo but consider it is an herb of Venus, for all it hath a man’s name.\r\n\r\n\r\n    HERB TRUE-LOVE, OR ONE-BERRY.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] ORDINARY Herb True-love has a small creeping root running\r\nunder the uppermost crust of the ground, somewhat like couch grass\r\nroot, but not so white, shooting forth stalks with leaves, some whereof\r\ncarry no berries, the others do; every stalk smooth without joints,\r\nand blackish green, rising about half a foot high, if it bear berries,\r\notherwise seldom so high, bearing at the top four leaves set directly\r\none against another, in manner of a cross or ribband tied (as it is\r\ncalled in a true-loves knot,) which are each of them apart somewhat\r\nlike unto a night-shade leaf, but somewhat broader, having sometimes\r\nthree leaves, sometimes five, sometimes six, and those sometimes\r\ngreater than in others, in the middle of the four leaves rise up one\r\nsmall slender stalk, about an inch high, bearing at the tops thereof\r\none flower spread open like a star, consisting of four small and long\r\nnarrow pointed leaves of a yellowish green colour, and four others\r\nlying between them lesser than they; in the middle whereof stands\r\na round dark purplish button or head, compassed about with eight\r\nsmall yellow mealy threads with three colours, making it the more\r\nconspicuous, and lovely to behold. This button or head in the middle,\r\nwhen the other leaves are withered, becomes a blackish purple berry,\r\nfull of juice, of the bigness of a reasonable grape, having within it\r\nmany white seeds. The whole plant is without any manifest taste.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in woods and copses, and sometimes in the corners or\r\nborders of fields, and waste grounds in very many places of this land,\r\nand abundantly in the woods, copses, and other places about Chislehurst\r\nand Maidstone in Kent.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They spring up in the middle of April or May, and are in\r\nflower soon after. The berries are ripe in the end of May, and in some\r\nplaces in June.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Venus owns it; the leaves or berries hereof\r\nare effectual to expel poison of all sorts, especially that of the\r\naconites; as also, the plague, and other pestilential disorders;\r\nMatthiolus saith, that some that have lain long in a lingering\r\nsickness, and others that by witchcraft (as it was thought) were become\r\nhalf foolish, by taking a dram of the seeds or berries hereof in\r\npowder every day for 20 days together, were restored to their former\r\nhealth. The roots in powder taken in wine eases the pains of the cholic\r\nspeedily. The leaves are very effectual as well for green wounds, as to\r\ncleanse and heal up filthy old sores and ulcers; and is very powerful\r\nto discuss all tumours and swellings in the privy parts, the groin, or\r\nin any part of the body, and speedily to allay all inflammations. The\r\njuice of the leaves applied to felons, or those nails of the hands or\r\ntoes that have imposthumes or sores gathered together at the roots of\r\nthem, heals them in a short space. The herb is not to be described for\r\nthe premises, but is fit to be nourished in every good woman’s garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n    HYSSOP.\r\n\r\nHYSSOP is so well known to be an inhabitant in every garden, that it\r\nwill save me labour in writing a description thereof. The virtues are\r\nas follow.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The herb is Jupiter’s, and the sign Cancer.\r\nIt strengthens all the parts of the body under Cancer and Jupiter;\r\nwhich what they may be, is found amply described in my astrological\r\njudgment of diseases. Dioscorides saith, that Hyssop boiled with\r\nrue and honey, and drank, helps those that are troubled with coughs,\r\nshortness of breath, wheezing and rheumatic distillation upon the\r\nlungs; taken also with oxymel, it purges gross humours by stool; and\r\nwith honey, kills worms in the belly; and with fresh and new figs\r\nbruised, helps to loosen the belly, and more forcibly if the root of\r\nFlower-de-luce and cresses be added thereto. It amends and cherishes\r\nthe native colour of the body, spoiled by the yellow jaundice; and\r\nbeing taken with figs and nitre, helps the dropsy and spleen; being\r\nboiled with wine, it is good to wash inflammations, and takes away the\r\nblack and blue spots and marks that come by strokes, bruises, or falls,\r\nbeing applied with warm water. It is an excellent medicine for the\r\nquinsy, or swellings in the throat, to wash and gargle it, being boiled\r\nin figs; it helps the tooth-ache, being boiled in vinegar and gargled\r\ntherewith. The hot vapours of the decoction taken by a funnel in at the\r\nears, eases the inflammations and singing noise of them. Being bruised,\r\nand salt, honey, and cummin seed put to it, helps those that are stung\r\nby serpents. The oil thereof (the head being anointed) kills lice, and\r\ntakes away itching of the head. It helps those that have the falling\r\nsickness, which way soever it be applied. It helps to expectorate tough\r\nphlegm, and is effectual in all cold griefs or diseases of the chests\r\nor lungs, being taken either in syrup or licking medicine. The green\r\nherb bruised and a little sugar put thereto, doth quickly heal any cut\r\nor green wounds, being thereunto applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n    HOPS.\r\n\r\nTHESE are so well known that they need no description; I mean the\r\nmanured kind, which every good husband or housewife is acquainted with.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The wild hop grows up as the other doth, ramping upon\r\ntrees or hedges, that stand next to them, with rough branches and\r\nleaves like the former, but it gives smaller heads, and in far less\r\nplenty than it, so that there is scarcely a head or two seen in a year\r\non divers of this wild kind, wherein consists the chief difference.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They delight to grow in low moist grounds, and are found in\r\nall parts of this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They spring not until April, and flower not until the latter\r\nend of June; the heads are not gathered until the middle or latter end\r\nof September.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of Mars. This, in\r\nphysical operations, is to open obstructions of the liver and spleen,\r\nto cleanse the blood, to loosen the belly, to cleanse the reins from\r\ngravel, and provoke urine. The decoction of the tops of Hops, as well\r\nof the tame as the wild, works the same effects. In cleansing the blood\r\nthey help to cure the French diseases, and all manner of scabs, itch,\r\nand other breakings-out of the body; as also all tetters, ringworms,\r\nand spreading sores, the morphew and all discolouring of the skin. The\r\ndecoction of the flowers and hops, do help to expel poison that any one\r\nhath drank. Half a dram of the seed in powder taken in drink, kills\r\nworms in the body, brings down women’s courses, and expels urine. A\r\nsyrup made of the juice and sugar, cures the yellow jaundice, eases the\r\nhead-ache that comes of heat, and tempers the heat of the liver and\r\nstomach, and is profitably given in long and hot agues that rise in\r\ncholer and blood. Both the wild and the manured are of one property,\r\nand alike effectual in all the aforesaid diseases. By all these\r\ntestimonies beer appears to be better than ale.\r\n\r\nMars owns the plant, and then Dr. Reason will tell you how it performs\r\nthese actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n    HOREHOUND.\r\n\r\nTHERE are two kinds of Horehound, the white and the black. The black\r\nsort is likewise called Hen-bit; but the white one is here spoken of.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] Common Horehound grows up with square hairy stalks, half a\r\nyard or two feet high, set at the joints with two round crumpled rough\r\nleaves of a sullen hoary green colour, of a reasonable good scent, but\r\na very bitter taste. The flowers are small, white, and gaping, set in a\r\nrough, hard prickly husk round about the joints, with the leaves from\r\nthe middle of the stalk upward, wherein afterward is found small round\r\nblackish seed. The root is blackish, hard and woody, with many strings,\r\nand abides many years.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It is found in many parts of this land, in dry grounds, and\r\nwaste green places.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in July, and the seed is ripe in August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of Mercury. A decoction of\r\nthe dried herb, with the seed, or the juice of the green herb taken\r\nwith honey, is a remedy for those that are short-winded, have a cough,\r\nor are fallen into a consumption, either through long sickness, or\r\nthin distillations of rheum upon the lungs. It helps to expectorate\r\ntough phlegm from the chest, being taken from the roots of Iris or\r\nOrris. It is given to women to bring down their courses, to expel the\r\nafter-birth, and to them that have taken poison, or are stung or bitten\r\nby venemous serpents. The leaves used with honey, purge foul ulcers,\r\nstay running or creeping sores, and the growing of the flesh over\r\nthe nails. It also helps pains of the sides. The juice thereof with\r\nwine and honey, helps to clear the eyesight, and snuffed up into the\r\nnostrils, purges away the yellow-jaundice, and with a little oil of\r\nroses dropped into the ears, eases the pains of them. Galen saith, it\r\nopens obstructions both of the liver and spleen, and purges the breast\r\nand lungs of phlegm: and used outwardly it both cleanses and digests. A\r\ndecoction of Horehound (saith Matthiolus) is available for those that\r\nhave hard livers, and for such as have itches and running tetters.\r\nThe powder hereof taken, or the decoction, kills worms. The green\r\nleaves bruised, and boiled in old hog’s grease into an ointment, heals\r\nthe biting of dogs, abates the swellings and pains that come by any\r\npricking of thorns, or such like means; and used with vinegar, cleanses\r\nand heals tetters. There is a syrup made of Horehound to be had at the\r\napothecaries, very good for old coughs, to rid the tough phlegm; as\r\nalso to void cold rheums from the lungs of old folks, and for those\r\nthat are asthmatic or short-winded.\r\n\r\n\r\n    HORSETAIL.\r\n\r\nOF that there are many kinds, but I shall not trouble you nor myself\r\nwith any large description of them, which to do, were but, as the\r\nproverb is, To find a knot in a rush, all the kinds thereof being\r\nnothing else but knotted rushes, some with leaves, and some without.\r\nTake the description of the most eminent sort as follows.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The great Horsetail at the first springing has heads\r\nsomewhat like those of asparagus, and afterwards grow to be hard,\r\nrough, hollow stalks, jointed at sundry places up to the top, a foot\r\nhigh, so made as if the lower parts were put into the upper, where grow\r\non each side a bush of small long rush-like hard leaves, each part\r\nresembling a horsetail, from whence it is so called. At the tops of the\r\nstalks come forth small catkins, like those of trees. The root creeps\r\nunder ground, having joints at sundry places.\r\n\r\n_Place._] This (as most of the other sorts hereof) grows in wet\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They spring up in April, and their blooming catkins in July,\r\nseeding for the most part in August, and then perish down to the\r\nground, rising afresh in the Spring.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The herb belongs to Saturn, yet is very\r\nharmless, and excellently good for the things following: Horsetail, the\r\nsmoother rather than the rough, and the leaves rather than the bare, is\r\nmost physical. It is very powerful to staunch bleeding either inward or\r\noutward, the juice or the decoction thereof being drank, or the juice,\r\ndecoction, or distilled water applied outwardly. It also stays all\r\nsorts of lasks and fluxes in man or woman, and bloody urine; and heals\r\nalso not only the inward ulcers, and the excoriation of the entrails,\r\nbladder, &c. but all other sorts of foul, moist and running ulcers, and\r\nsoon solders together the tops of green wounds. It cures all ruptures\r\nin children. The decoction thereof in wine being drank, provokes urine,\r\nand helps the stone and stranguary; and the distilled water thereof\r\ndrank two or three times in a day, and a small quantity at a time,\r\nalso eases the bowels, and is effectual against a cough that comes by\r\ndistillations from the head. The juice or distilled water being warmed,\r\nand hot inflammations, pustules or red wheals, and other breakings-out\r\nin the skin, being bathed therewith, doth help them, and doth no less\r\nthe swelling heat and inflammation of the lower parts in men and women.\r\n\r\n\r\n    HOUSELEEK OR SENGREEN.\r\n\r\nBOTH these are so well known to my countrymen, that I shall not need to\r\nwrite any description of them.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows commonly upon walls and house-sides, and flowers in\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of Jupiter, and it is reported\r\nby Mezaldus, to preserve what it grows upon from fire and lightning.\r\nOur ordinary Houseleek is good for all inward heats as well as\r\noutward, and in the eyes or other parts of the body; a posset made with\r\nthe juice of Houseleek, is singularly good in all hot agues, for it\r\ncools and tempers the blood and spirits, and quenches the thirst; and\r\nalso good to stay all hot defluctions or sharp and salt rheums in the\r\neyes, the juice being dropped into them, or into the ears. It helps\r\nalso other fluxes of humours in the bowels, and the immoderate courses\r\nof women. It cools and restrains all other hot inflammations, St.\r\nAnthony’s fire, scaldings and burnings, the shingles, fretting ulcers,\r\ncankers, tettors, ringworms, and the like; and much eases the pains\r\nof the gout proceeding from any hot cause. The juice also takes away\r\nworts and corns in the hands or feet, being often bathed therewith, and\r\nthe skin and leaves being laid on them afterwards. It eases also the\r\nhead-ache, and distempered heat of the brain in frenzies, or through\r\nwant of sleep, being applied to the temples and forehead. The leaves\r\nbruised and laid upon the crown or seam of the head, stays bleeding at\r\nthe nose very quickly. The distilled water of the herb is profitable\r\nfor all the purposes aforesaid. The leaves being gently rubbed on any\r\nplace stung with nettles or bees, doth quickly take away the pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n    HOUND’S TONGUE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THE great ordinary Hound’s Tongue has many long and\r\nsomewhat narrow, soft, hairy, darkish green leaves, lying on the\r\nground, somewhat like unto Bugloss leaves, from among which rises up\r\na rough hairy stalk about two feet high, with some smaller leaves\r\nthereon, and branched at the tops into divers parts, with a small leaf\r\nat the foot of every branch, which is somewhat long, with many flowers\r\nset along the same, which branch is crooked or turned inwards before\r\nit flowers, and opens by degrees as the flowers blow, which consist\r\nof small purplish red leaves of a dead colour, rising out of the husks\r\nwherein they stand with some threads in the middle. It has sometimes a\r\nwhite flower. After the flowers are past, there comes rough flat seed,\r\nwith a small pointle in the middle, easily cleaving to any garment that\r\nit touches, and not so easily pulled off again. The root is black,\r\nthick, and long, hard to break, and full of clammy juice, smelling\r\nsomewhat strong, of an evil scent, as the leaves also do.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in moist places of this land, in waste grounds, and\r\nuntilled places, by highway sides, lanes, and hedge-sides.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers about May or June, and the seed is ripe shortly\r\nafter.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a plant under the dominion of Mercury.\r\nThe root is very effectually used in pills, as well as the decoction,\r\nor otherwise, to stay all sharp and thin defluxions of rheum from the\r\nhead into the eyes or nose, or upon the stomach or lungs, as also\r\nfor coughs and shortness of breath. The leaves boiled in wine (saith\r\nDioscorides, but others do rather appoint it to be made with water, and\r\nadd thereto oil and salt) molifies or opens the belly downwards. It\r\nalso helps to cure the biting of a mad dog, some of the leaves being\r\nalso applied to the wound: The leaves bruised, or the juice of them\r\nboiled in hog’s lard, and applied, helps falling away of the hair,\r\nwhich comes of hot and sharp humours; as also for any place that is\r\nscalded or burnt; the leaves bruised and laid to any green wound doth\r\nheal it up quickly: the root baked under the embers, wrapped in paste\r\nor wet paper, or in a wet double cloth, and thereof a suppository made,\r\nand put up into or applied to the fundament, doth very effectually help\r\nthe painful piles or hæmorrhoids. The distilled water of the herbs and\r\nroots is very good to all the purposes aforesaid, to be used as well\r\ninwardly to drink, as outwardly to wash any sore place, for it heals\r\nall manner of wounds and punctures, and those foul ulcers that arise by\r\nthe French pox. Mizaldus adds that the leaves laid under the feet, will\r\nkeep the dogs from barking at you. It is called Hound’s-tongue, because\r\nit ties the tongues of hounds; whether true, or not, I never tried, yet\r\nI cured the biting of a mad dog with this only medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n    HOLLY, HOLM, OR HULVER BUSH.\r\n\r\nFOR to describe a tree so well known is needless.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The tree is Saturnine. The berries expel\r\nwind, and therefore are held to be profitable in the cholic. The\r\nberries have a strong faculty with them; for if you eat a dozen of them\r\nin the morning fasting when they are ripe and not dried, they purge the\r\nbody of gross and clammy phlegm: but if you dry the berries, and beat\r\nthem into powder, they bind the body, and stop fluxes, bloody-fluxes,\r\nand the terms in women. The bark of the tree, and also the leaves, are\r\nexcellently good, being used in fomentations for broken bones, and such\r\nmembers as are out of joint. Pliny saith, the branches of the tree\r\ndefend houses from lightning, and men from witchcraft.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ST. JOHN’S WORT.\r\n\r\nTHIS is a very beautiful shrub, and is a great ornament to our meadows.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] Common St. John’s Wort shoots forth brownish, upright,\r\nhard, round stalks, two feet high, spreading many branches from the\r\nsides up to the tops of them, with two small leaves set one against\r\nanother at every place, which are of a deep green colour, somewhat\r\nlike the leaves of the lesser Centaury, but narrow, and full of small\r\nholes in every leaf, which cannot be so well perceived, as when they\r\nare held up to the light; at the tops of the stalks and branches stand\r\nyellow flowers of five leaves a-piece, with many yellow threads in the\r\nmiddle, which being bruised do yield a reddish juice like blood; after\r\nwhich come small round heads, wherein is contained small blackish seed\r\nsmelling like rosin. The root is hard and woody, with divers strings\r\nand fibres at it, of a brownish colour, which abides in the ground many\r\nyears, shooting anew every Spring.\r\n\r\n_Place._] This grows in woods and copses, as well those that are shady,\r\nas open to the sun.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower about Midsummer and July, and their seed is ripe\r\nin the latter end of July or August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the celestial sign Leo, and the\r\ndominion of the Sun. It may be, if you meet a Papist, he will tell\r\nyou, especially if he be a lawyer, that St. John made it over to him\r\nby a letter of attorney. It is a singular wound herb; boiled in wine\r\nand drank, it heals inward hurts or bruises; made into an ointment,\r\nit open obstructions, dissolves swellings, and closes up the lips of\r\nwounds. The decoction of the herb and flowers, especially of the seed,\r\nbeing drank in wine, with the juice of knot-grass, helps all manner of\r\nvomiting and spitting of blood, is good for those that are bitten or\r\nstung by any venomous creature, and for those that cannot make water.\r\nTwo drams of the seed of St. John’s Wort made into powder, and drank\r\nin a little broth, doth gently expel choler or congealed blood in the\r\nstomach. The decoction of the leaves and seeds drank somewhat warm\r\nbefore the fits of agues, whether they be tertains or quartans, alters\r\nthe fits, and, by often using, doth take them quite away. The seed\r\nis much commended, being drank for forty days together, to help the\r\nsciatica, the falling-sickness, and the palsy.\r\n\r\n\r\n    IVY.\r\n\r\nIT is so well known to every child almost, to grow in woods upon the\r\ntrees, and upon the stone walls of churches, houses, &c. and sometimes\r\nto grow alone of itself, though but seldom.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers not until July, and the berries are not ripe till\r\nChristmas, when they have felt Winter frosts.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of Saturn. A pugil\r\nof the flowers, which may be about a dram, (saith Dioscorides) drank\r\ntwice a day in red wine, helps the lask, and bloody flux. It is an\r\nenemy to the nerves and sinews, being much taken inwardly, but very\r\nhelpful to them, being outwardly applied. Pliny saith, the yellow\r\nberries are good against the jaundice; and taken before one be set\r\nto drink hard, preserves from drunkenness, and helps those that spit\r\nblood; and that the white berries being taken inwardly, or applied\r\noutwardly, kills the worms in the belly. The berries are a singular\r\nremedy to prevent the plague, as also to free them from it that have\r\ngot it, by drinking the berries thereof made into a powder, for two or\r\nthree days together. They being taken in wine, do certainly help to\r\nbreak the stone, provoke urine, and women’s courses. The fresh leaves\r\nof Ivy, boiled in vinegar, and applied warm to the sides of those that\r\nare troubled with the spleen, ache, or stitch in the sides, do give\r\nmuch ease: The same applied with some Rosewater, and oil of Roses, to\r\nthe temples and forehead, eases the head-ache, though it be of long\r\ncontinuance. The fresh leaves boiled in wine, and old filthy ulcers\r\nhard to be cured washed therewith, do wonderfully help to cleanse\r\nthem. It also quickly heals green wounds, and is effectual to heal all\r\nburnings and scaldings, and all kinds of exulcerations coming thereby,\r\nor by salt phlegm or humours in other parts of the body. The juice of\r\nthe berries or leaves snuffed up into the nose, purges the head and\r\nbrain of thin rheum that makes defluxions into the eyes and nose, and\r\ncuring the ulcers and stench therein; the same dropped into the ears\r\nhelps the old and running sores of them, those that are troubled with\r\nthe spleen, shall find much ease by continual drinking out of a cup\r\nmade of Ivy, so as the drink may stand some small time therein before\r\nit be drank. Cato saith, That wine put into such a cup, will soak\r\nthrough it, by reason of the antipathy that is between them.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a very great antipathy between wine and Ivy; for if\r\none hath got a surfeit by drinking of wine, his speediest cure is to\r\ndrink a draught of the same wine wherein a handful of Ivy leaves, being\r\nfirst bruised, have been boiled.\r\n\r\n\r\n    JUNIPER BUSH.\r\n\r\nFOR to give a description of a bush so commonly known is needless.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow plentifully in divers woods in Kent, Warney common\r\nnear Brentwood in Essex, upon Finchley Common without Highgate; hard\r\nby the Newfound Wells near Dulwich, upon a Common between Mitcham and\r\nCroydon, in the Highgate near Amersham in Buckinghamshire, and many\r\nother places.\r\n\r\n_Time._] The berries are not ripe the first year, but continue green\r\ntwo Summers and one Winter before they are ripe; at which time they are\r\nall of a black colour, and therefore you shall always find upon the\r\nbush green berries; the berries are ripe about the fall of the leaf.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] This admirable solar shrub is scarce to be\r\nparalleled for its virtues. The berries are hot in the third degree,\r\nand dry but in the first, being a most admirable counter-poison,\r\nand as great a resister of the pestilence, as any growing; they are\r\nexcellent good against the biting of venomous beasts, they provoke\r\nurine exceedingly, and therefore are very available to dysuries and\r\nstranguaries. It is so powerful a remedy against the dropsy, that the\r\nvery lye made of the ashes of the herb being drank, cures the disease.\r\nIt provokes the terms, helps the fits of the mother, strengthens the\r\nstomach exceedingly, and expels the wind. Indeed there is scarce a\r\nbetter remedy for wind in any part of the body, or the cholic, than the\r\nchymical oil drawn from the berries; such country people as know not\r\nhow to draw the chymical oil, may content themselves by eating ten or\r\na dozen of the ripe berries every morning fasting. They are admirably\r\ngood for a cough, shortness of breath, and consumption, pains in the\r\nbelly, ruptures, cramps, and convulsions. They give safe and speedy\r\ndelivery to women with child, they strengthen the brain exceedingly,\r\nhelp the memory, and fortify the sight by strengthening the optic\r\nnerves; are excellently good in all sorts of agues; help the gout and\r\nsciatica, and strengthen the limbs of the body. The ashes of the wood\r\nis a speedy remedy to such as have the scurvy, to rub their gums with.\r\nThe berries stay all fluxes, help the hæmorrhoids or piles, and kill\r\nworms in children. A lye made of the ashes of the wood, and the body\r\nbathed with it, cures the itch, scabs and leprosy. The berries break\r\nthe stone, procure appetite when it is lost, and are excellently good\r\nfor all palsies, and falling-sickness.\r\n\r\n\r\n    KIDNEYWORT, OR WALL PENNYROYAL,\r\n    OR WALL PENNYWORT.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] IT has many thick, flat, and round leaves growing from the\r\nroot, every one having a long footstalk, fastened underneath, about the\r\nmiddle of it, and a little unevenly weaved sometimes about the edges,\r\nof a pale green colour, and somewhat yellow on the upper side like\r\na saucer; from among which arise one or more tender, smooth, hollow\r\nstalks half a foot high, with two or three small leaves thereon,\r\nusually not round as those below, but somewhat long, and divided at\r\nthe edges: the tops are somewhat divided into long branches, bearing\r\na number of flowers, set round about a long spike one above another,\r\nwhich are hollow and like a little bell of a whitish green colour,\r\nafter which come small heads, containing very small brownish seed,\r\nwhich falling on the ground, will plentifully spring up before Winter,\r\nif it have moisture. The root is round and most usually smooth, greyish\r\nwithout, and white within, having small fibres at the head of the root,\r\nand bottom of the stalk.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows very plentifully in many places of this land, but\r\nespecially in all the west parts thereof, upon stone and mud walls,\r\nupon rocks also, and in stony places upon the ground, at the bottom of\r\nold trees, and sometimes on the bodies of them that are decayed and\r\nrotten.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It usually flowers in the beginning of May, and the seed\r\nripening quickly after, sheds itself; so that about the end of May,\r\nusually the stalks and leaves are withered, dry, and gone until\r\nSeptember, then the leaves spring up again, and so abide all winter.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Venus challenges the herb under Libra. The\r\njuice or the distilled water being drank, is very effectual for all\r\ninflammations and unnatural heats, to cool a fainting hot stomach, a\r\nhot liver, or the bowels: the herb, juice, or distilled water thereof,\r\noutwardly applied, heals pimples, St. Anthony’s fire, and other outward\r\nheats. The said juice or water helps to heal sore kidneys, torn or\r\nfretted by the stone, or exulcerated within; it also provokes urine,\r\nis available for the dropsy, and helps to break the stone. Being used\r\nas a bath, or made into an ointment, it cools the painful piles or\r\nhæmorrhoidal veins. It is no less effectual to give ease to the pains\r\nof the gout, the sciatica, and helps the kernels or knots in the neck\r\nor throat, called the king’s evil: healing kibes and chilblains if\r\nthey be bathed with the juice, or anointed with ointment made thereof,\r\nand some of the skin of the leaf upon them: it is also used in green\r\nwounds to stay the blood, and to heal them quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n    KNAPWEED.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THE common sort hereof has many long and somewhat dark\r\ngreen leaves, rising from the root, dented about the edges, and\r\nsometimes a little rent or torn on both sides in two or three places,\r\nand somewhat hairy withal; amongst which arises a long round stalk,\r\nfour or five feet high, divided into many branches, at the tops whereof\r\nstand great scaly green heads, and from the middle of them thrust forth\r\na number of dark purplish red thrumbs or threads, which after they are\r\nwithered and past, there are found divers black seeds, lying in a great\r\ndeal of down, somewhat like unto Thistle seed, but smaller; the root\r\nis white, hard and woody, and divers fibres annexed thereunto, which\r\nperishes not, but abides with leaves thereon all the Winter, shooting\r\nout fresh every spring.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in most fields and meadows, and about their borders\r\nand hedges, and in many waste grounds also every where.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It usually flowers in June and July, and the seed is ripe\r\nshortly after.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Saturn challenges the herb for his own. This\r\nKnapweed helps to stay fluxes, both of blood at the mouth or nose,\r\nor other outward parts, and those veins that are inwardly broken, or\r\ninward wounds, as also the fluxes of the belly; it stays distillation\r\nof thin and sharp humours from the head upon the stomach and lungs; it\r\nis good for those that are bruised by any fall, blows or otherwise,\r\nand is profitable for those that are bursten, and have ruptures, by\r\ndrinking the decoction of the herb and roots in wine, and applying\r\nthe same outwardly to the place. It is singularly good in all running\r\nsores, cancerous and fistulous, drying up of the moisture, and healing\r\nthem up so gently, without sharpness; it doth the like to running sores\r\nor scabs of the head or other parts. It is of special use for the\r\nsoreness of the throat, swelling of the uvula and jaws, and excellently\r\ngood to stay bleeding, and heal up all green wounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n    KNOTGRASS.\r\n\r\nIT is generally known so well that it needs no description.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in every county of this land by the highway sides,\r\nand by foot-paths in fields; as also by the sides of old walls.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It springs up late in the Spring, and abides until the Winter,\r\nwhen all the branches perish.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Saturn seems to me to own the herb, and yet\r\nsome hold the Sun; out of doubt ’tis Saturn. The juice of the common\r\nkind of Knotgrass is most effectual to stay bleeding of the mouth,\r\nbeing drank in steeled or red wine; and the bleeding at the nose, to\r\nbe applied to the forehead or temples, or to be squirted up into the\r\nnostrils. It is no less effectual to cool and temper the heat of the\r\nblood and stomach, and to stay any flux of the blood and humours, as\r\nlasks, bloody-flux, women’s courses, and running of the reins. It is\r\nsingularly good to provoke urine, help the stranguary, and allays the\r\nheat that comes thereby; and is powerful by urine to expel the gravel\r\nor stone in the kidneys and bladder, a dram of the powder of the herb\r\nbeing taken in wine for many days together. Being boiled in wine and\r\ndrank, it is profitable to those that are stung or bitten by venemous\r\ncreatures, and very effectual to stay all defluxions of rheumatic\r\nhumours upon the stomach, and kills worms in the belly or stomach,\r\nquiets inward pains that arise from the heat, sharpness and corruption\r\nof blood and choler. The distilled water hereof taken by itself or with\r\nthe powder of the herb or seed, is very effectual to all the purposes\r\naforesaid, and is accounted one of the most sovereign remedies to cool\r\nall manner of inflammations, breaking out through heat, hot swellings\r\nand imposthumes, gangrene and fistulous cankers, or foul filthy ulcers,\r\nbeing applied or put into them; but especially for all sorts of ulcers\r\nand sores happening in the privy parts of men and women. It helps all\r\nfresh and green wounds, and speedily heals them. The juice dropped into\r\nthe ears, cleanses them being foul, and having running matter in them.\r\n\r\nIt is very prevalent for the premises; as also for broken joints and\r\nruptures.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LADIES’ MANTLE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] IT has many leaves rising from the root standing upon\r\nlong hairy foot-stalks, being almost round, and a little cut on the\r\nedges, into eight or ten parts, making it seem like a star, with so\r\nmany corners and points, and dented round about, of a light green\r\ncolour, somewhat hard in handling, and as it were folded or plaited at\r\nfirst, and then crumpled in divers places, and a little hairy, as the\r\nstalk is also, which rises up among them to the height of two or three\r\nfeet; and being weak, is not able to stand upright, but bended to the\r\nground, divided at the top into two or three small branches, with small\r\nyellowish green heads, and flowers of a whitish colour breaking out of\r\nthem; which being past, there comes a small yellowish seed like a poppy\r\nseed: The root is somewhat long and black, with many strings and fibres\r\nthereat.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows naturally in many pastures and wood sides in\r\nHertfordshire, Wiltshire, and Kent, and other places of this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in May and June, abides after seedtime green all\r\nthe Winter.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Venus claims the herb as her own. Ladies’\r\nMantle is very proper for those wounds that have inflammations, and\r\nis very effectual to stay bleeding, vomitings, fluxes of all sorts,\r\nbruises by falls or otherwise, and helps ruptures; and such women as\r\nhave large breasts, causing them to grow less and hard, being both\r\ndrank and outwardly applied; the distilled water drank for 20 days\r\ntogether helps conception, and to retain the birth; if the women do\r\nsometimes also sit in a bath made of the decoction of the herb. It is\r\none of the most singular wound herbs that is, and therefore highly\r\nprized and praised by the Germans, who use it in all wounds inward and\r\noutward, to drink a decoction thereof, and wash the wounds therewith,\r\nor dip tents therein, and put them into the wounds, which wonderfully\r\ndries up all humidity of the sores, and abates inflammations therein.\r\nIt quickly heals all green wounds, not suffering any corruption to\r\nremain behind, and cures all old sores, though fistulous and hollow.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LAVENDER.\r\n\r\nBEING an inhabitant almost in every garden, it is so well known, that\r\nit needs no description.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers about the end of June, and beginning of July.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Mercury owns the herb; and it carries his\r\neffects very potently. Lavender is of a special good use for all the\r\ngriefs and pains of the head and brain that proceed of a cold cause,\r\nas the apoplexy, falling-sickness, the dropsy, or sluggish malady,\r\ncramps, convulsions, palsies, and often faintings. It strengthens the\r\nstomach, and frees the liver and spleen from obstructions, provokes\r\nwomen’s courses, and expels the dead child and after-birth. The\r\nflowers of Lavender steeped in wine, helps them to make water that\r\nare stopped, or are troubled with the wind or cholic, if the place\r\nbe bathed therewith. A decoction made with the flowers of Lavender,\r\nHore-hound, Fennel and Asparagus root, and a little Cinnamon, is very\r\nprofitably used to help the falling-sickness, and the giddiness or\r\nturning of the brain: to gargle the mouth with the decoction thereof is\r\ngood against the tooth-ache. Two spoonfuls of the distilled water of\r\nthe flowers taken, helps them that have lost their voice, as also the\r\ntremblings and passions of the heart, and faintings and swooning, not\r\nonly being drank, but applied to the temples, or nostrils to be smelled\r\nunto; but it is not safe to use it where the body is replete with blood\r\nand humours, because of the hot and subtile spirits wherewith it is\r\npossessed. The chymical oil drawn from Lavender, usually called Oil of\r\nSpike, is of so fierce and piercing a quality, that it is cautiously\r\nto be used, some few drops being sufficient, to be given with other\r\nthings, either for inward or outward griefs.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LAVENDER-COTTON.\r\n\r\nIT being a common garden herb, I shall forbear the description, only\r\ntake notice, that it flowers in June and July.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of Mercury. It\r\nresists poison, putrefaction, and heals the biting of venomous beasts:\r\nA dram of the powder of the dried leaves taken every morning fasting,\r\nstops the running of the reins in men, and whites in women. The seed\r\nbeaten into powder, and taken as worm-seed, kills the worms, not only\r\nin children, but also in people of riper years; the like doth the herb\r\nitself, being steeped in milk, and the milk drank; the body bathed with\r\nthe decoction of it, helps scabs and itch.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LADIES-SMOCK, OR CUCKOW-FLOWER.\r\n\r\nTHIS is a very pretty ornament to the sides of most meadows.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The root is composed of many small white threads from\r\nwhence spring up divers long stalks of winged leaves, consisting of\r\nround, tender, dark, green leaves, set one against another upon a\r\nmiddle rib, the greatest being at the end, amongst which arise up\r\ndivers tender, weak, round, green stalks, somewhat streaked, with\r\nlonger and smaller leaves upon them; on the tops of which stand\r\nflowers, almost like the Stock Gilliflowers, but rounder, and not so\r\nlong, of a blushing white colour; the seed is reddish, and grows to\r\nsmall branches, being of a sharp biting taste, and so has the herb.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow in moist places, and near to brooksides.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in April and May, and the lower leaves continue\r\ngreen all the Winter.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] They are under the dominion of the Moon, and\r\nvery little inferior to Water Cresses in all their operations; they\r\nare excellently good for the scurvy, they provoke urine, and break the\r\nstone, and excellently warm a cold and weak stomach, restoring lost\r\nappetite, and help digestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LETTUCE.\r\n\r\nIT is so well known, being generally used as a Sallad-herb, that it is\r\naltogether needless to write any description thereof.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The Moon owns them, and that is the reason\r\nthey cool and moisten what heat and dryness Mars causeth, because Mars\r\nhas his fall in Cancer; and they cool the heat because the Sun rules\r\nit, between whom and the Moon is a reception in the generation of men,\r\nas you may see in my Guide for Women. The juice of Lettuce mixed or\r\nboiled with Oil of Roses, applied to the forehead and temples procures\r\nsleep, and eases the headache proceeding of an hot cause: Being eaten\r\nboiled, it helps to loosen the belly. It helps digestion, quenches\r\nthirst, increases milk in nurses, eases griping pains in the stomach\r\nor bowels, that come of choler. Applied outwardly to the region of the\r\nheart, liver or reins, or by bathing the said places with the juice\r\nof distilled water, wherein some white Sanders, or red Roses are put;\r\nnot only represses the heat and inflammations therein, but comforts\r\nand strengthens those parts, and also tempers the heat of urine. Galen\r\nadvises old men to use it with spice; and where spices are wanting,\r\nto add Mints, Rochet, and such like hot herbs, or else Citron Lemon,\r\nor Orange seeds, to abate the cold of one and heat of the other. The\r\nseed and distilled water of the Lettuce work the same effects in all\r\nthings; but the use of Lettuce is chiefly forbidden to those that are\r\nshort-winded, or have any imperfection in the lungs, or spit blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WATER LILY.\r\n\r\nOF these there are two principally noted kinds, _viz._ the White and\r\nthe Yellow.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The White Lily has very large and thick dark green\r\nleaves lying on the water, sustained by long and thick foot-stalks,\r\nthat arise from a great, thick, round, and long tuberous black root\r\nspongy or loose, with many knobs thereon, green on the outside, but as\r\nwhite as snow within, consisting of divers rows of long and somewhat\r\nthick and narrow leaves, smaller and thinner the more inward they be,\r\nencompassing a head with many yellow threads or thrums in the middle;\r\nwhere, after they are past, stand round Poppy-like heads, full of broad\r\noily and bitter seed.\r\n\r\nThe yellow kind is little different from the former, save only that it\r\nhas fewer leaves on the flowers, greater and more shining seed, and a\r\nwhitish root, both within and without. The root of both is somewhat\r\nsweet in taste.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They are found growing in great pools, and standing waters,\r\nand sometimes in slow running rivers, and lesser ditches of water, in\r\nsundry places of this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower most commonly about the end of May, and their seed\r\nis ripe in August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The herb is under the dominion of the Moon,\r\nand therefore cools and moistens like the former. The leaves and\r\nflowers of the Water Lilies are cold and moist, but the roots and seeds\r\nare cold and dry; the leaves do cool all inflammations, both outward\r\nand inward heat of agues; and so doth the flowers also, either by the\r\nsyrup or conserve; the syrup helps much to procure rest, and to settle\r\nthe brain of frantic persons, by cooling the hot distemperature of the\r\nhead. The seed as well as the root is effectual to stay fluxes of blood\r\nor humours, either of wounds or of the belly; but the roots are most\r\nused, and more effectual to cool, bind, and restrain all fluxes in man\r\nor woman. The root is likewise very good for those whose urine is hot\r\nand sharp, to be boiled in wine and water, and the decoction drank. The\r\ndistilled water of the flowers is very effectual for all the diseases\r\naforesaid, both inwardly taken, and outwardly applied; and is much\r\ncommended to take away freckles, spots, sunburn, and morphew from the\r\nface, or other parts of the body. The oil made of the flowers, as oil\r\nof Roses is made, is profitably used to cool hot tumours, and to ease\r\nthe pains, and help the sores.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LILY OF THE VALLEY.\r\n\r\nCALLED also Conval Lily, Male Lily, and Lily Confancy.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The root is small, and creeps far in the ground, as grass\r\nroots do. The leaves are many, against which rises up a stalk half\r\na foot high, with many white flowers, like little bells with turned\r\nedges of a strong, though pleasing smell; the berries are red, not\r\nmuch unlike those of Asparagus.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow plentifully upon Hampstead-Heath, and many other\r\nplaces in this nation.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in May, and the seed is ripe in September.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT AND VIRTUES.] It is under the dominion of Mercury, and\r\ntherefore it strengthens the brain, recruits a weak memory, and makes\r\nit strong again: The distilled water dropped into the eyes, helps\r\ninflammations there; as also that infirmity which they call a pin and\r\nweb. The spirit of the flowers distilled in wine, restores lost speech,\r\nhelps the palsy, and is excellently good in the apoplexy, comforts\r\nthe heart and vital spirits. Gerrard saith, that the flowers being\r\nclose stopped up in a glass, put into an ant-hill, and taken away\r\nagain a month after, ye shall find a liquor in the glass, which, being\r\noutwardly applied, helps the gout.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WHITE LILIES.\r\n\r\nIT were in vain to describe a plant so commonly known in every one’s\r\ngarden; therefore I shall not tell you what they are, but what they are\r\ngood for.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] They are under the dominion of the Moon,\r\nand by antipathy to Mars expel poison; they are excellently good in\r\npestilential fevers, the roots being bruised and boiled in wine, and\r\nthe decoction drank; for it expels the venom to the exterior parts of\r\nthe body: The juice of it being tempered with barley meal, baked, and\r\nso eaten for ordinary bread, is an excellent cure for the dropsy: An\r\nointment made of the root, and hog’s grease, is excellently good for\r\nscald heads, unites the sinews when they are cut, and cleanses ulcers.\r\nThe root boiled in any convenient decoction, gives speedy delivery to\r\nwomen in travail, and expels the afterbirth. The root roasted, and\r\nmixed with a little hog’s grease, makes a gallant poultice to ripen and\r\nbreak plague-sores. The ointment is excellently good for swellings in\r\nthe privities, and will cure burnings and scaldings without a scar, and\r\ntrimly deck a blank place with hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LIQUORICE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] OUR English Liquorice rises up with divers woody stalks,\r\nwhereon are set at several distances many narrow, long, green leaves,\r\nset together on both sides of the stalk, and an odd one at the end,\r\nvery well resembling a young ash tree sprung up from the seed. This\r\nby many years continuance in a place without removing, and not else,\r\nwill bring forth flowers, many standing together spike fashion, one\r\nabove another upon the stalk, of the form of pease blossoms, but of a\r\nvery pale blue colour, which turn into long, somewhat flat and smooth\r\ncods, wherein is contained a small, round, hard seed: The roots run\r\ndown exceeding deep into the ground, with divers other small roots and\r\nfibres growing with them, and shoot out suckers from the main roots\r\nall about, whereby it is much increased, of a brownish colour on the\r\noutside, and yellow within.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It is planted in fields and gardens, in divers places of this\r\nland, and thereof good profit is made.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of Mercury.\r\nLiquorice boiled in fair water, with some Maiden-hair and figs, makes a\r\ngood drink for those that have a dry cough or hoarseness, wheezing or\r\nshortness of breath, and for all the griefs of the breast and lungs,\r\nphthisic or consumptions caused by the distillation of salt humours\r\non them. It is also good in all pains of the reins, the stranguary,\r\nand heat of urine: The fine powder of Liquorice blown through a\r\nquill into the eyes that have a pin and web (as they call it) or\r\nrheumatic distillations in them, doth cleanse and help them. The juice\r\nof Liquorice is as effectual in all the diseases of the breast and\r\nlungs, the reins and bladder, as the decoction. The juice distilled in\r\nRose-water, with some Gum Tragacanth, is a fine licking medicine for\r\nhoarseness, wheezing, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LIVERWORT.\r\n\r\nTHERE are, according to some botanists, upwards of three hundred\r\ndifferent kinds of Liverwort.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] Common Liverwort grows close, and spreads much upon the\r\nground in moist and shady places, with many small green leaves, or\r\nrather (as it were) sticking flat to one another, very unevenly cut\r\nin on the edges, and crumpled; from among which arise small slender\r\nstalks, an inch or two high at most, bearing small star-like flowers at\r\nthe top; the roots are very fine and small.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of Jupiter, and\r\nunder the sign Cancer. It is a singularly good herb for all the\r\ndiseases of the liver, both to cool and cleanse it, and helps the\r\ninflammations in any part, and the yellow jaundice likewise. Being\r\nbruised and boiled in small beer, and drank, it cools the heat of the\r\nliver and kidneys, and helps the running of the reins in men, and the\r\nwhites in women; it is a singular remedy to stay the spreading of\r\ntetters, ringworms, and other fretting and running sores and scabs, and\r\nis an excellent remedy for such whose livers are corrupted by surfeits,\r\nwhich cause their bodies to break out, for it fortifies the liver\r\nexceedingly, and makes it impregnable.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LOOSESTRIFE OR WILLOW-HERB.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] COMMON yellow Loosestrife grows to be four or five feet\r\nhigh, or more, with great round stalks, a little crested, diversly\r\nbranched from the middle of them to the tops into great and long\r\nbranches, on all which, at the joints, there grow long and narrow\r\nleaves, but broader below, and usually two at a joint, yet sometimes\r\nthree or four, somewhat like willow leaves, smooth on the edges, and\r\nof a fair green colour from the upper joints of the branches, and at\r\nthe tops of them also stand many yellow flowers of five leaves a-piece,\r\nwith divers yellow threads in the middle, which turn into small round\r\nheads, containing small cornered seeds: the root creeps under ground,\r\nalmost like coughgrass, but greater, and shoots up every Spring\r\nbrownish heads which afterwards grow up into stalks. It has no scent or\r\ntaste, and is only astringent.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in many places of the land in moist meadows, and by\r\nwater sides.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers from June to August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] This herb is good for all manner of bleeding\r\nat the mouth, nose, or wounds, and all fluxes of the belly, and the\r\nbloody-flux, given either to drink or taken by clysters; it stays also\r\nthe abundance of women’s courses; it is a singular good wound-herb for\r\ngreen wounds, to stay the bleeding, and quickly close together the lips\r\nof the wound, if the herb be bruised, and the juice only applied. It is\r\noften used in gargles for sore mouths, as also for the secret parts.\r\nThe smoak hereof being bruised, drives away flies and gnats, which in\r\nthe night time molest people inhabiting near marshes, and in the fenny\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LOOSESTRIFE, WITH SPIKED HEADS OF\r\n    FLOWERS.\r\n\r\nIT is likewise called Grass-polly.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] This grows with many woody square stalks, full of joints,\r\nabout three feet high at least; at every one whereof stand two long\r\nleaves, shorter, narrower, and a greener colour than the former, and\r\nsome brownish. The stalks are branched into many long stems of spiked\r\nflowers half a foot long, growing in bundles one above another, out\r\nof small husks, very like the spiked heads of Lavender, each of which\r\nflowers have five round-pointed leaves of a purple violet colour, or\r\nsomewhat inclining to redness; in which husks stand small round heads\r\nafter the flowers are fallen, wherein is contained small seed. The\r\nroot creeps under ground like unto the yellow, but is greater than it,\r\nand so are the heads of the leaves when they first appear out of the\r\nground, and more brown than the other.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows usually by rivers, and ditch-sides in wet ground, as\r\nabout the ditches at and near Lambeth, and in many places of this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in the months of June and July.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of the Moon, and under the\r\nsign Cancer; neither do I know a better preserver of the sight when\r\nit is well, nor a better cure for sore eyes than Eyebright, taken\r\ninwardly, and this used outwardly; it is cold in quality. This herb\r\nis nothing inferior to the former, it having not only all the virtues\r\nwhich the former hath, but more peculiar virtues of its own, found\r\nout by experience; as, namely, The distilled water is a present\r\nremedy for hurts and blows on the eyes, and for blindness, so as the\r\nChristalline humours be not perished or hurt; and this hath been\r\nsufficiently proved true by the experience of a man of judgment, who\r\nkept it long to himself as a great secret. It clears the eyes of dust,\r\nor any thing gotten into them, and preserves the sight. It is also very\r\navailable against wounds and thrusts, being made into an ointment in\r\nthis manner: To every ounce of the water, add two drams of May butter\r\nwithout salt, and of sugar and wax, of each as much also; let them\r\nboil gently together. Let tents dipped into the liquor that remains\r\nafter it is cold, be put into the wounds, and the place covered with\r\na linen cloth doubled and anointed with the ointment; and this is also\r\nan approved medicine. It likewise cleanses and heals all foul ulcers,\r\nand sores whatsoever, and stays their inflammations by washing them\r\nwith the water, and laying on them a green leaf or two in the Summer,\r\nor dry leaves in the Winter. This water, gargled warm in the mouth,\r\nand sometimes drank also, doth cure the quinsy, or king’s evil in the\r\nthroat. The said water applied warm, takes away all spots, marks, and\r\nscabs in the skin; and a little of it drank, quenches thirst when it is\r\nextreme.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LOVAGE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] IT has many long and green stalks of large winged leaves,\r\ndivided into many parts, like Smallage, but much larger and greater,\r\nevery leaf being cut about the edges, broadest forward, and smallest at\r\nthe stalk, of a sad green colour, smooth and shining; from among which\r\nrise up sundry strong, hollow green stalks, five or six, sometimes\r\nseven or eight feet high, full of joints, but lesser leaves set on\r\nthem than grow below; and with them towards the tops come forth large\r\nbranches, bearing at their tops large umbels of yellow flowers, and\r\nafter them flat brownish seed. The roots grow thick, great and deep,\r\nspreading much, and enduring long, of a brownish colour on the outside,\r\nand whitish within. The whole plant and every part of it smelling\r\nstrong, and aromatically, and is of a hot, sharp, biting taste.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It is usually planted in gardens, where, if it be suffered,\r\nit grows huge and great.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in the end of July, and seeds in August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of the Sun, under the sign\r\nTaurus. If Saturn offend the throat (as he always doth if he be\r\noccasioner of the malady, and in Taurus is the Genesis) this is your\r\ncure. It opens, cures and digests humours, and mightily provokes\r\nwomen’s courses and urine. Half a dram at a time of the dried root\r\nin powder taken in wine, doth wonderfully warm a cold stomach, helps\r\ndigestion, and consumes all raw and superfluous moisture therein; eases\r\nall inward gripings and pains, dissolves wind, and resists poison and\r\ninfection. It is a known and much praised remedy to drink the decoction\r\nof the herb for any sort of ague, and to help the pains and torments\r\nof the body and bowels coming of cold. The seed is effectual to all\r\nthe purposes aforesaid (except the last) and works more powerfully.\r\nThe distilled water of the herb helps the quinsy in the throat, if\r\nthe mouth and throat be gargled and washed therewith, and helps the\r\npleurisy, being drank three or four times. Being dropped into the eyes,\r\nit takes away the redness or dimness of them; it likewise takes away\r\nspots or freckles in the face. The leaves bruised, and fried with a\r\nlittle hog’s lard, and put hot to any blotch or boil, will quickly\r\nbreak it.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LUNGWORT.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS is a kind of moss, that grows on sundry sorts of\r\ntrees, especially oaks and beeches, with broad, greyish, tough leaves\r\ndiversly folded, crumpled, and gashed in on the edges, and some spotted\r\nalso with many small spots on the upper-side. It was never seen to bear\r\nany stalk or flower at any time.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Jupiter seems to own this herb. It is of\r\ngreat use to physicians to help the diseases of the lungs, and for\r\ncoughs, wheezings, and shortness of breath, which it cures both in man\r\nand beast. It is very profitable to put into lotions that are taken to\r\nstay the moist humours that flow to ulcers, and hinder their healing,\r\nas also to wash all other ulcers in the privy parts of a man or woman.\r\nIt is an excellent remedy boiled in beer for broken-winded horses.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MADDER.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] GARDEN Madder shoots forth many very long, weak,\r\nfour-square, reddish stalks, trailing on the ground a great way, very\r\nrough or hairy, and full of joints: At every one of these joints come\r\nforth divers long and narrow leaves, standing like a star about the\r\nstalks, round also and hairy, towards the tops whereof come forth many\r\nsmall pale yellow flowers, after which come small round heads, green at\r\nfirst, and reddish afterwards, but black when they are ripe, wherein\r\nis contained the seed. The root is not very great, but exceeding long,\r\nrunning down half a man’s length into the ground, red and very clear,\r\nwhile it is fresh, spreading divers ways.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It is only manured in gardens, or larger fields, for the\r\nprofit that is made thereof.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers towards the end of Summer, and the seed is ripe\r\nquickly after.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of Mars. It hath an opening\r\nquality, and afterwards to bind and strengthen. It is a sure remedy\r\nfor the yellow jaundice, by opening the obstructions of the liver and\r\ngall, and cleansing those parts; it opens also the obstructions of the\r\nspleen, and diminishes the melancholy humour. It is available for the\r\npalsy and sciatica, and effectual for bruises inward and outward, and\r\nis therefore much used in vulnerary drinks. The root for all those\r\naforesaid purposes, is to be boiled in wine or water, as the cause\r\nrequires, and some honey and sugar put thereunto afterwards. The seed\r\nhereof taken in vinegar and honey, helps the swelling and hardness\r\nof the spleen. The decoction of the leaves and branches is a good\r\nfomentation for women that have not their courses. The leaves and roots\r\nbeaten and applied to any part that is discoloured with freckles,\r\nmorphew, the white scurf, or any such deformity of the skin, cleanses\r\nthoroughly, and takes them away.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MAIDEN HAIR.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] OUR common Maiden-Hair doth, from a number of hard black\r\nfibres, send forth a great many blackish shining brittle stalks, hardly\r\na span long, in many not half so long, on each side set very thick with\r\nsmall, round, dark green leaves, and spitted on the back of them like a\r\nfern.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows upon old stone walls in the West parts in Kent,\r\nand divers other places of this land; it delights likewise to grow by\r\nsprings, wells, and rocky moist and shady places, and is always green.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WALL RUE, OR, WHITE MAIDEN-HAIR.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS has very fine, pale green stalks, almost as fine as\r\nhairs, set confusedly with divers pale green leaves on every short\r\nfoot stalk, somewhat near unto the colour of garden Rue, and not much\r\ndiffering in form but more diversly cut in on the edges, and thicker,\r\nsmooth on the upper part, and spotted finely underneath.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in many places of this land, at Dartford, and the\r\nbridge at Ashford in Kent, at Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire, at Wolly\r\nin Huntingtonshire, on Framlingham Castle in Suffolk, on the church\r\nwalls at Mayfield in Sussex, in Somersetshire, and divers other places\r\nof this land; and is green in Winter as well as Summer.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Both this and the former are under the\r\ndominion of Mercury, and so is that also which follows after, and the\r\nvirtue of both are so near alike, that though I have described them and\r\ntheir places of growing severally, yet I shall in writing the virtues\r\nof them, join them both together as follows.\r\n\r\nThe decoction of the herb Maiden-Hair being drank, helps those that are\r\ntroubled with the cough, shortness of breath, the yellow jaundice,\r\ndiseases of the spleen, stopping of urine, and helps exceedingly to\r\nbreak the stone in the kidneys, (in all which diseases the Wall Rue\r\nis also very effectual.) It provokes women’s courses, and stays both\r\nbleedings and fluxes of the stomach and belly, especially when the\r\nherb is dry; for being green, it loosens the belly, and voids choler\r\nand phlegm from the stomach and liver; it cleanses the lungs, and by\r\nrectifying the blood, causes a good colour to the whole body. The herb\r\nboiled in oil of Camomile, dissolves knots, allays swellings, and dries\r\nup moist ulcers. The lye made thereof is singularly good to cleanse\r\nthe head from scurf, and from dry and running sores, stays the falling\r\nor shedding of the hair, and causes it to grow thick, fair, and well\r\ncoloured; for which purpose some boil it in wine, putting some Smallage\r\nseed thereto, and afterwards some oil. The Wall Rue is as effectual as\r\nMaiden-Hair, in all diseases of the head, or falling and recovering of\r\nthe hair again, and generally for all the aforementioned diseases: And\r\nbesides, the powder of it taken in drink for forty days together, helps\r\nthe burstings in children.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GOLDEN MAIDEN HAIR\r\n\r\nTo the former give me leave to add this, and I shall say no more but\r\nonly describe it to you, and for the virtues refer you to the former,\r\nsince whatever is said of them, may be also said of this.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] It has many small, brownish, red hairs, to make up the\r\nform of leaves growing about the ground from the root; and in the\r\nmiddle of them, in Summer, rise small stalks of the same colour, set\r\nwith very fine yellowish green hairs on them, and bearing a small gold,\r\nyellow head, less than a wheat corn, standing in a great husk. The root\r\nis very small and thready.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in bogs and moorish places, and also on dry shady\r\nplaces, as Hampstead Heath, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MALLOWS AND MARSHMALLOWS.\r\n\r\nCOMMON Mallows are generally so well known that they need no\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nOur common Marshmallows have divers soft hairy white stalks, rising to\r\nbe three or four feet high, spreading forth many branches, the leaves\r\nwhereof are soft and hairy, somewhat less than the other Mallow leaves,\r\nbut longer pointed, cut (for the most part) into some few divisions,\r\nbut deep. The flowers are many, but smaller also than the other\r\nMallows, and white, or tending to a bluish colour. After which come\r\nsuch long, round cases and seeds, as in the other Mallows. The roots\r\nare many and long, shooting from one head, of the bigness of a thumb\r\nor finger, very pliant, tough, and being like liquorice, of a whitish\r\nyellow colour on the outside, and more whitish within, full of a slimy\r\njuice, which being laid in water, will thicken, as if it were a jelly.\r\n\r\n_Place._] The common Mallows grow in every county of this land. The\r\ncommon Marsh-mallows in most of the salt marshes, from Woolwich down\r\nto the sea, both on the Kentish and Essex shores, and in divers other\r\nplaces of this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower all the Summer months, even until the Winter do\r\npull them down.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Venus owns them both. The leaves of either\r\nof the sorts, both specified, and the roots also boiled in wine or\r\nwater, or in broth with Parsley or Fennel roots, do help to open the\r\nbody, and are very convenient in hot agues, or other distempers of the\r\nbody, to apply the leaves so boiled warm to the belly. It not only\r\nvoids hot, choleric, and other offensive humours, but eases the pains\r\nand torments of the belly coming thereby; and are therefore used in all\r\nclysters conducing to those purposes. The same used by nurses procures\r\nthem store of milk. The decoction of the seed of any of the common\r\nMallows made in milk or wine, doth marvellously help excoriations,\r\nthe phthisic, pleurisy, and other diseases of the chest and lungs,\r\nthat proceed of hot causes, if it be continued taking for some time\r\ntogether. The leaves and roots work the same effects. They help much\r\nalso in the excoriations of the bowels, and hardness of the mother, and\r\nin all hot and sharp diseases thereof. The juice drank in wine, or the\r\ndecoction of them therein, do help women to a speedy and easy delivery.\r\nPliny saith, that whosoever takes a spoonful of any of the Mallows,\r\nshall that day be free from all diseases that may come unto him; and\r\nthat it is especially good for the falling-sickness. The syrup also and\r\nconserve made of the flowers, are very effectual for the same diseases,\r\nand to open the body, being costive. The leaves bruised, and laid to\r\nthe eyes with a little honey, take away the imposthumations of them.\r\nThe leaves bruised or rubbed upon any place stung with bees, wasps, or\r\nthe like, presently take away the pain, redness, and swelling that rise\r\nthereupon. And Dioscorides saith, The decoction of the roots and leaves\r\nhelps all sorts of poison, so as the poison be presently voided by\r\nvomit. A poultice made of the leaves boiled and bruised, with some bean\r\nor barley flower, and oil of Roses added, is an especial remedy against\r\nall hard tumours and inflammations, or imposthumes, or swellings of\r\nthe privities, and other parts, and eases the pains of them; as also\r\nagainst the hardness of the liver or spleen, being applied to the\r\nplaces. The juice of Mallows boiled in old oil and applied, takes away\r\nall roughness of the skin, as also the scurf, dandriff, or dry scabs\r\nin the head, or other parts, if they be anointed therewith, or washed\r\nwith the decoction, and preserves the hair from falling off. It is also\r\neffectual against scaldings and burnings, St. Anthony’s fire, and all\r\nother hot, red, and painful swellings in any part of the body. The\r\nflowers boiled in oil or water (as every one is disposed) whereunto a\r\nlittle honey and allum is put, is an excellent gargle to wash, cleanse\r\nor heal any sore mouth or throat in a short space. If the feet be\r\nbathed or washed with the decoction of the leaves, roots, and flowers,\r\nit helps much the defluxions of rheum from the head; if the head be\r\nwashed therewith, it stays the falling and shedding of the hair. The\r\ngreen leaves (saith Pliny) beaten with nitre, and applied, draw out\r\nthorns or prickles in the flesh.\r\n\r\nThe Marshmallows are more effectual in all the diseases before\r\nmentioned: The leaves are likewise used to loosen the belly gently,\r\nand in decoctions or clysters to ease all pains of the body, opening\r\nthe strait passages, and making them slippery, whereby the stone may\r\ndescend the more easily and without pain, out of the reins, kidneys,\r\nand bladder, and to ease the torturing pains thereof. But the roots\r\nare of more special use for those purposes, as well for coughs,\r\nhoarseness, shortness of breath and wheezings, being boiled in wine,\r\nor honeyed water, and drank. The roots and seeds hereof boiled in wine\r\nor water, are with good success used by them that have excoriations\r\nin the bowels, or the bloody flux, by qualifying the violence of\r\nsharp fretting humours, easing the pains, and healing the soreness.\r\nIt is profitably taken by them that are troubled with ruptures,\r\ncramps, or convulsions of the sinews; and boiled in white wine, for\r\nthe imposthumes by the throat, commonly called the king’s evil, and\r\nof those kernels that rise behind the ears, and inflammations or\r\nswellings in women’s breasts. The dried roots boiled in milk and drank,\r\nis especially good for the chin-cough. Hippocrates used to give the\r\ndecoction of the roots, or the juice thereof, to drink, to those that\r\nare wounded, and ready to faint through loss of blood, and applied the\r\nsame, mixed with honey and rosin, to the wounds. As also, the roots\r\nboiled in wine to those that have received any hurt by bruises, falls,\r\nor blows, or had any bone or member out of joint, or any swelling-pain,\r\nor ache in the muscles, sinews or arteries. The muscilage of the roots,\r\nand of Linseed and Fenugreek put together, is much used in poultices,\r\nointments, and plaisters, to molify and digest all hard swellings, and\r\nthe inflammation of them, and to ease pains in any part of the body.\r\nThe seed either green or dry, mixed with vinegar, cleanses the skin of\r\nmorphew, and all other discolourings being boiled therewith in the Sun.\r\n\r\nYou may remember that not long since there was a raging disease called\r\nthe bloody-flux; the college of physicians not knowing what to make of\r\nit, called it the inside plague, for their wits were at _Ne plus ultra_\r\nabout it: My son was taken with the same disease, and the excoriation\r\nof his bowels was exceeding great; myself being in the country, was\r\nsent for up, the only thing I gave him, was Mallows bruised and boiled\r\nboth in milk and drink, in two days (the blessing of God being upon\r\nit) it cured him. And I here, to shew my thankfulness to God, in\r\ncommunicating it to his creatures, leave it to posterity.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MAPLE TREE.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] IT is under the dominion of Jupiter. The\r\ndecoction either of the leaves or bark, must needs strengthen the liver\r\nmuch, and so you shall find it to do, if you use it. It is excellently\r\ngood to open obstructions both of the liver and spleen, and eases pains\r\nof the sides thence proceeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WIND MARJORAM.\r\n\r\nCALLED also Origanum, Eastward Marjoram; Wild Marjoram, and Grove\r\nMarjoram.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] Wild or field Marjoram hath a root which creeps much under\r\nground, which continues a long time, sending up sundry brownish, hard,\r\nsquare stalks, with small dark green leaves, very like those of Sweet\r\nMarjoram, but harder, and somewhat broader; at the top of the stalks\r\nstand tufts of flowers, of a deep purplish red colour. The seed is\r\nsmall and something blacker than that of Sweet Marjoram.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows plentifully in the borders of corn fields, and in\r\nsome copses.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers towards the latter end of the Summer.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] This is also under the dominion of Mercury.\r\nIt strengthens the stomach and head much, there being scarce a better\r\nremedy growing for such as are troubled with a sour humour in the\r\nstomach; it restores the appetite being lost; helps the cough, and\r\nconsumption of the lungs; it cleanses the body of choler, expels\r\npoison, and remedies the infirmities of the spleen; helps the bitings\r\nof venomous beasts, and helps such as have poisoned themselves by\r\neating Hemlock, Henbane, or Opium. It provokes urine and the terms\r\nin women, helps the dropsy, and the scurvy, scabs, itch, and yellow\r\njaundice. The juice being dropped into the ears, helps deafness, pain\r\nand noise in the ears. And thus much for this herb, between which and\r\nadders, there is a deadly antipathy.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SWEET MARJORAM.\r\n\r\nSWEET Marjoram is so well known, being an inhabitant in every garden,\r\nthat it is needless to write any description thereof, neither of the\r\nWinter Sweet Marjoram, or Pot Marjoram.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow commonly in gardens; some sorts grow wild in the\r\nborders of corn fields and pastures, in sundry places of this land;\r\nbut it is not my purpose to insist upon them. The garden kinds being\r\nmost used and useful.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in the end of Summer.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of Mercury, and under Aries,\r\nand therefore is an excellent remedy for the brain and other parts of\r\nthe body and mind, under the dominion of the same planet. Our common\r\nSweet Marjoram is warming and comfortable in cold diseases of the head,\r\nstomach, sinews, and other parts, taken inwardly, or outwardly applied.\r\nThe decoction thereof being drank, helps all diseases of the chest\r\nwhich hinder the freeness of breathing, and is also profitable for the\r\nobstructions of the liver and spleen. It helps the cold griefs of the\r\nwomb, and the windiness thereof, and the loss of speech, by resolution\r\nof the tongue. The decoction thereof made with some Pellitory of\r\nSpain, and long Pepper, or with a little Acorns or Origanum, being\r\ndrank, is good for those that cannot make water, and against pains and\r\ntorments in the belly; it provokes women’s courses, if it be used as a\r\npessary. Being made into powder, and mixed with honey, it takes away\r\nthe black marks of blows, and bruises, being thereunto applied; it is\r\ngood for the inflammations and watering of the eyes, being mixed with\r\nfine flour, and laid unto them. The juice dropped into the ears eases\r\nthe pains and singing noise in them. It is profitably put into those\r\nointments and salves that are warm, and comfort the outward parts, as\r\nthe joints and sinews; for swellings also, and places out of joint. The\r\npowder thereof snuffed up into the nose provokes sneezing, and thereby\r\npurges the brain; and chewed in the mouth, draws forth much phlegm.\r\nThe oil made thereof, is very warm and comfortable to the joints that\r\nare stiff, and the sinews that are hard, to molify and supple them.\r\nMarjoram is much used in all odoriferous water, powders, &c. that are\r\nfor ornament or delight.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MARIGOLDS.\r\n\r\nTHESE being so plentiful in every garden, and so well known that they\r\nneed no description.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower all the Summer long, and sometimes in Winter, if\r\nit be mild.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of the Sun, and under Leo.\r\nThey strengthen the heart exceedingly, and are very expulsive, and a\r\nlittle less effectual in the small-pox and measles than saffron. The\r\njuice of Marigold leaves mixed with vinegar, and any hot swelling\r\nbathed with it, instantly gives ease, and assuages it. The flowers,\r\neither green or dried, are much used in possets, broths, and drink, as\r\na comforter of the heart and spirits, and to expel any malignant or\r\npestilential quality which might annoy them. A plaister made with the\r\ndry flowers in powder, hog’s-grease, turpentine, and rosin, applied to\r\nthe breast, strengthens and succours the heart infinitely in fevers,\r\nwhether pestilential or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MASTERWORT.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] COMMON Masterwort has divers stalks of winged leaves\r\ndivided into sundry parts, three for the most part standing together\r\nat a small foot-stalk on both sides of the greater, and three likewise\r\nat the end of the stalk, somewhat broad, and cut in on the edges into\r\nthree or more divisions, all of them dented about the brims, of a dark\r\ngreen colour, somewhat resembling the leaves of Angelica, but that\r\nthese grow lower to the ground, and on lesser stalks; among which rise\r\nup two or three short stalks about two feet high, and slender, with\r\nsuch like leaves at the joints which grow below, but with lesser and\r\nfewer divisions, bearing umbels of white flowers, and after them thin,\r\nflat blackish seeds, bigger than Dill seeds. The root is somewhat\r\ngreater and growing rather side-ways than down deep in the ground,\r\nshooting forth sundry heads, which taste sharp, biting on the tongue,\r\nand is the hottest and sharpest part of the plant, and the seed next\r\nunto it being somewhat blackish on the outside, and smelling well.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It is usually kept in gardens with us in England.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers and seeds about the end of August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of Mars. The root of\r\nMasterwort is hotter than pepper, and very available in cold griefs\r\nand diseases both of the stomach and body, dissolving very powerfully\r\nupwards and downwards. It is also used in a decoction with wine against\r\nall cold rheums, distillations upon the lungs, or shortness of breath,\r\nto be taken morning and evening. It also provokes urine, and helps\r\nto break the stone, and expel the gravel from the kidneys; provokes\r\nwomen’s courses, and expels the dead birth. It is singularly good for\r\nstrangling of the mother, and other such like feminine diseases. It is\r\neffectual also against the dropsy, cramps, and falling sickness; for\r\nthe decoction in wine being gargled in the mouth, draws down much water\r\nand phlegm, from the brain, purging and easing it of what oppresses it.\r\nIt is of a rare quality against all sorts of cold poison, to be taken\r\nas there is cause; it provokes sweat. But lest the taste hereof, or of\r\nthe seed (which works to the like effect, though not so powerfully)\r\nshould be too offensive, the best way is to take the water distilled\r\nboth from the herb and root. The juice hereof dropped, or tents dipped\r\ntherein, and applied either to green wounds or filthy rotten ulcers,\r\nand those that come by envenomed weapons, doth soon cleanse and heal\r\nthem. The same is also very good to help the gout coming of a cold\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SWEET MAUDLIN.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] COMMON Maudlin hath somewhat long and narrow leaves,\r\nsnipped about the edges. The stalks are two feet high, bearing at the\r\ntops many yellow flowers set round together and all of an equal height,\r\nin umbels or tufts like unto tansy; after which follow small whitish\r\nseed, almost as big as wormseed.\r\n\r\n_Place and Time._] It grows in gardens, and flowers in June and July.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The Virtues hereof being the same with\r\nCostmary or Alecost, I shall not make any repetition thereof, lest my\r\nbook grow too big; but rather refer you to Costmary for satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE MEDLAR.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THE Tree grows near the bigness of the Quince Tree,\r\nspreading branches reasonably large, with longer and narrower leaves\r\nthan either the apple or quince, and not dented about the edges. At\r\nthe end of the sprigs stand the flowers, made of five white, great,\r\nbroad-pointed leaves, nicked in the middle with some white threads\r\nalso; after which comes the fruit, of a brownish green colour, being\r\nripe, bearing a crown as it were on the top, which were the five green\r\nleaves; and being rubbed off, or fallen away, the head of the fruit\r\nis seen to be somewhat hollow. The fruit is very harsh before it is\r\nmellowed, and has usually five hard kernels within it. There is another\r\nkind hereof nothing differing from the former, but that it hath some\r\nthorns on it in several places, which the other hath not; and usually\r\nthe fruit is small, and not so pleasant.\r\n\r\n_Time and Place._] They grow in this land, and flower in May for the\r\nmost part, and bear fruit in September and October.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The fruit is old Saturn’s, and sure a better\r\nmedicine he hardly hath to strengthen the retentive faculty; therefore\r\nit stays women’s longings: The good old man cannot endure women’s\r\nminds should run a gadding. Also a plaister made of the fruit dried\r\nbefore they are rotten, and other convenient things, and applied to\r\nthe reins of the back, stops miscarriage in women with child. They are\r\npowerful to stay any fluxes of blood or humours in men or women; the\r\nleaves also have this quality. The decoction of them is good to gargle\r\nand wash the mouth, throat and teeth, when there is any defluxions of\r\nblood to stay it, or of humours, which causes the pains and swellings.\r\nIt is a good bath for women, that have their courses flow too abundant:\r\nor for the piles when they bleed too much. If a poultice or plaister be\r\nmade with dried medlars, beaten and mixed with the juice of red roses,\r\nwhereunto a few cloves and nutmegs may be added, and a little red coral\r\nalso, and applied to the stomach that is given to casting or loathing\r\nof meat, it effectually helps. The dried leaves in powder strewed on\r\nfresh bleeding wounds restrains the blood, and heals up the wound\r\nquickly. The medlar-stones made into powder, and drank in wine, wherein\r\nsome Parsley-roots have lain infused all night, or a little boiled, do\r\nbreak the stone in the kidneys, helping to expel it.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MELLILOT, OR KING’S CLAVER.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS hath many green stalks, two or three feet high,\r\nrising from a tough, long, white root, which dies not every year, set\r\nround about at the joints with small and somewhat long, well-smelling\r\nleaves, set three together, unevently dented about the edges. The\r\nflowers are yellow, and well-smelling also, made like other trefoil,\r\nbut small, standing in long spikes one above another, for an hand\r\nbreadth long or better, which afterwards turn into long crooked pods,\r\nwherein is contained flat seed, somewhat brown.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows plentifully in many places of this land, as in the\r\nedge of Suffolk and in Essex, as also in Huntingdonshire, and in other\r\nplaces, but most usually in corn fields, in corners of meadows.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in June and July, and is ripe quickly after.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Melilot, boiled in wine, and applied,\r\nmollifies all hard tumours and inflammations that happen in the eyes,\r\nor other parts of the body, and sometimes the yolk of a roasted egg, or\r\nfine flour, or poppy seed, or endive, is added unto it. It helps the\r\nspreading ulcers in the head, it being washed with a lye made thereof.\r\nIt helps the pains of the stomach, being applied fresh, or boiled\r\nwith any of the aforenamed things; also, the pains of the ears, being\r\ndropped into them; and steeped in vinegar, or rose water, it mitigates\r\nthe head-ache. The flowers of Mellilot or Camomile are much used to\r\nbe put together in clysters to expel wind, and ease pains; and also\r\nin poultices for the same purpose, and to assuage swelling tumours in\r\nthe spleen or other parts, and helps inflammations in any part of the\r\nbody. The juice dropped into the eyes, is a singularly good medicine to\r\ntake away the film or skin that clouds or dimns the eye-sight. The head\r\noften washed with the distilled water of the herb and flower, or a lye\r\nmade therewith, is effectual for those that suddenly lose their senses;\r\nas also to strengthen the memory, to comfort the head and brain, and to\r\npreserve them from pain, and the apoplexy.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FRENCH AND DOG MERCURY.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS rises up with a square green stalk full of joints,\r\ntwo feet high, or thereabouts, with two leaves at every joint, and the\r\nbranches likewise from both sides of the stalk, set with fresh green\r\nleaves, somewhat broad and long, about the bigness of the leaves of\r\nBazil, finely dented about the edges; towards the tops of the stalk\r\nand branches, come forth at every joint in the male Mercury two\r\nsmall, round green heads, standing together upon a short foot stalk,\r\nwhich growing ripe, are seeds, not having flowers. The female stalk is\r\nlonger, spike-fashion, set round about with small green husks, which\r\nare the flowers, made small like bunches of grapes, which give no\r\nseed, but abiding long upon the stalks without shedding. The root is\r\ncomposed of many small fibres, which perishes every year at the first\r\napproach of Winter, and rises again of its own sowing; and if once it\r\nis suffered to sow itself, the ground will never want afterwards, even\r\nboth sorts of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n    DOG MERCURY.\r\n\r\nHAVING described unto you that which is called French Mercury, I come\r\nnow to shew you a description of this kind also.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] This is likewise of two kinds, male and Female, having\r\nmany stalks slender and lower than Mercury, without any branches at all\r\nupon them, the root is set with two leaves at every joint, somewhat\r\ngreater than the female, but more pointed and full of veins, and\r\nsomewhat harder in handling: of a dark green colour, and less denied\r\nor snipped about the edges. At the joints with the leaves come forth\r\nlonger stalks than the former, with two hairy round seeds upon them,\r\ntwice as big as those of the former Mercury. The taste hereof is herby,\r\nand the smell somewhat strong and virulent. The female has much harder\r\nleaves standing upon longer footstalks, and the stalks are also longer;\r\nfrom the joints come forth spikes of flowers like the French Female\r\nMercury. The roots of them both are many, and full of small fibres\r\nwhich run under ground, and mat themselves very much, not perishing\r\nas the former Mercuries do, but abide the Winter, and shoot forth new\r\nbranches every year, for the old lie down to the ground.\r\n\r\n_Place._] The male and female French Mercury are found wild in divers\r\nplaces of this land, as by a village called Brookland in Rumney Marsh\r\nin Kent.\r\n\r\nThe Dog Mercury in sundry places of Kent also, and elsewhere; but the\r\nfemale more seldom than the male.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in the Summer months, and therein give their seed.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Mercury, they say, owns the herb, but I\r\nrather think it is Venus’s, and I am partly confident of it too, for\r\nI never heard that Mercury ever minded women’s business so much:\r\nI believe he minds his study more. The decoction of the leaves of\r\nMercury, or the juice thereof in broth, or drank with a little sugar\r\nput to it, purges choleric and waterish humours. Hippocrates commended\r\nit wonderfully for women’s diseases, and applied to the secret parts,\r\nto ease the pains of the mother; and used the decoction of it, both to\r\nprocure women’s courses, and to expel the after-birth; and gave the\r\ndecoction thereof with myrrh or pepper, or used to apply the leaves\r\noutwardly against the stranguary and diseases of the reins and bladder.\r\nHe used it also for sore and watering eyes, and for the deafness and\r\npains in the ears, by dropping the juice thereof into them, and bathing\r\nthem afterwards in white wine. The decoction thereof made with water\r\nand a cock chicken, is a most safe medicine against the hot fits of\r\nagues. It also cleanses the breast and lungs of phlegm, but a little\r\noffends the stomach. The juice or distilled water snuffed up into the\r\nnostrils, purges the head and eyes of catarrhs and rheums. Some use to\r\ndrink two or three ounces of the distilled water, with a little sugar\r\nput to it, in the morning fasting, to open and purge the body of gross,\r\nviscous, and melancholy humours. Matthiolus saith, that both the seed\r\nof the male and female Mercury boiled with Wormwood and drank, cures\r\nthe yellow jaundice in a speedy manner. The leaves or the juice rubbed\r\nupon warts, takes them away. The juice mingled with some vinegar, helps\r\nall running scabs, tetters, ringworms, and the itch. Galen saith, that\r\nbeing applied in manner of a poultice to any swelling or inflammation,\r\nit digests the swelling, and allays the inflammation, and is therefore\r\ngiven in clysters to evacuate from the belly offensive humours. The Dog\r\nMercury, although it be less used, yet may serve in the same manner, to\r\nthe same purpose, to purge waterish and melancholy humours.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MINT.\r\n\r\nOF all the kinds of Mint, the Spear Mint, or Heart Mint, being most\r\nusual, I shall only describe as follows:\r\n\r\n_Descript._] Spear Mint has divers round stalks, and long but narrowish\r\nleaves set thereon, of a dark green colour. The flowers stand in spiked\r\nheads at the tops of the branches, being of a pale blue colour. The\r\nsmell or scent thereof is somewhat near unto Bazil; it encreases by the\r\nroot under ground as all the others do.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It is an usual inhabitant in gardens; and because it seldom\r\ngives any good seed, the seed is recompensed by the plentiful increase\r\nof the root, which being once planted in a garden, will hardly be rid\r\nout again.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers not until the beginning of August, for the most\r\npart.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of Venus. Dioscorides saith\r\nit hath a healing, binding and drying quality, and therefore the juice\r\ntaken in vinegar, stays bleeding: It stirs up venery, or bodily lust;\r\ntwo or three branches thereof taken in the juice of four pomegranates,\r\nstays the hiccough, vomiting, and allays the choler. It dissolves\r\nimposthumes being laid to with barley-meal. It is good to repress the\r\nmilk in women’s breasts, and for such as have swollen, flagging, or\r\ngreat breasts. Applied with salt, it helps the biting of a mad dog;\r\nwith mead and honeyed water, it eases the pains of the ears, and takes\r\naway the roughness of the tongue, being rubbed thereupon. It suffers\r\nnot milk to curdle in the stomach, if the leaves thereof be steeped\r\nor boiled in it before you drink it. Briefly it is very profitable to\r\nthe stomach. The often use hereof is a very powerful medicine to stay\r\nwomen’s courses and the whites. Applied to the forehead and temples,\r\nit eases the pains in the head, and is good to wash the heads of young\r\nchildren therewith, against all manner of breakings-out, sores or\r\nscabs, therein. It is also profitable against the poison of venomous\r\ncreatures. The distilled water of Mint is available to all the purposes\r\naforesaid, yet more weakly. But if a spirit thereof be rightly and\r\nchymically drawn, it is much more powerful than the herb itself. Simeon\r\nSethi saith, it helps a cold liver, strengthens the belly, causes\r\ndigestion, stays vomits and hiccough; it is good against the gnawing of\r\nthe heart, provokes appetite, takes away obstructions of the liver, and\r\nstirs up bodily lust; but therefore too much must not be taken, because\r\nit makes the blood thin and wheyish, and turns it into choler, and\r\ntherefore choleric persons must abstain from it. It is a safe medicine\r\nfor the biting of a mad dog, being bruised with salt and laid thereon.\r\nThe powder of it being dried and taken after meat, helps digestion, and\r\nthose that are splenetic. Taken with wine, it helps women in their sore\r\ntravail in child-bearing. It is good against the gravel and stone in\r\nthe kidneys, and the stranguary. Being smelled unto, it is comfortable\r\nfor the head and memory. The decoction hereof gargled in the mouth,\r\ncures the gums and mouth that are sore, and mends an ill-savoured\r\nbreath; as also the Rue and Coriander, causes the palate of the mouth\r\nto turn to its place, the decoction being gargled and held in the\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nThe virtues of the Wild or Horse Mint, such as grow in ditches (whose\r\ndescription I purposely omitted, in regard they are well known) are\r\nserviceable to dissolve wind in the stomach, to help the cholic, and\r\nthose that are short-winded, and are an especial remedy for those\r\nthat have veneral dreams and pollutions in the night, being outwardly\r\napplied. The juice dropped into the ears eases the pains of them,\r\nand destroys the worms that breed therein. They are good against the\r\nvenemous biting of serpents. The juice laid on warm, helps the king’s\r\nevil, or kernels in the throat. The decoction or distilled water helps\r\na stinking breath, proceeding from corruption of the teeth, and snuffed\r\nup the nose, purges the head. Pliny saith, that eating of the leaves\r\nhath been found by experience to cure the leprosy, applying some of\r\nthem to the face, and to help the scurf or dandriff of the head used\r\nwith vinegar. They are extremely bad for wounded people; and they say a\r\nwounded man that eats Mint, his wound will never be cured, and that is\r\na long day.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MISSELTO.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS rises up from the branch or arm of the tree whereon\r\nit grows, with a woody stem, putting itself into sundry branches,\r\nand they again divided into many other smaller twigs, interlacing\r\nthemselves one within another, very much covered with a greyish green\r\nbark, having two leaves set at every joint, and at the end likewise,\r\nwhich are somewhat long and narrow, small at the bottom, but broader\r\ntowards the end. At the knots or joints of the boughs and branches grow\r\nsmall yellow flowers, which run into small, round, white, transparent\r\nberries, three or four together, full of a glutinous moisture, with a\r\nblackish seed in each of them, which was never yet known to spring,\r\nbeing put into the ground, or any where else to grow.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows very rarely on oaks with us; but upon sundry others\r\nas well timber as fruit trees, plentifully in woody groves, and the\r\nlike, through all this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in the Spring-time, but the berries are not ripe\r\nuntil October, and abides on the branches all the Winter, unless the\r\nblackbirds, and other birds, do devour them.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] This is under the dominion of the Sun, I\r\ndo not question; and can also take for granted, that which grows upon\r\noaks, participates something of the nature of Jupiter, because an oak\r\nis one of his trees; as also that which grows upon pear trees, and\r\napple trees, participates something of his nature, because he rules\r\nthe tree it grows upon, having no root of its own. But why that should\r\nhave most virtues that grows upon oaks I know not, unless because it\r\nis rarest and hardest to come by; and our college’s opinion is in this\r\ncontrary to scripture, which saith, _God’s tender mercies are over\r\nall his works_; and so it is, let the college of physicians walk as\r\ncontrary to him as they please, and that is as contrary as the east\r\nto the west. Clusius affirms that which grows upon pear trees to be\r\nas prevalent, and gives order, that it should not touch the ground\r\nafter it is gathered; and also saith, that, being hung about the\r\nneck, it remedies witchcraft. Both the leaves and berries of Misselto\r\ndo heat and dry, and are of subtle parts; the birdlime doth molify\r\nhard knots, tumours, and imposthumes; ripens and discusses them, and\r\ndraws forth thick as well as thin humours from the remote parts of\r\nthe body, digesting and separating them. And being mixed with equal\r\nparts of rozin and wax, doth molify the hardness of the spleen, and\r\nhelps old ulcers and sores. Being mixed with Sandaric and Orpiment,\r\nit helps to draw off foul nails; and if quick-lime and wine lees be\r\nadded thereunto, it works the stronger. The Misselto itself of the oak\r\n(as the best) made into powder, and given in drink to those that have\r\nthe falling sickness, does assuredly heal them, as Matthiolus saith:\r\nbut it is fit to use it for forty days together. Some have so highly\r\nesteemed it for the virtues thereof, that they have called it _Lignum\r\nSanctiæ Crucis_, Wood of the Holy Cross, believing it helps the falling\r\nsickness, apoplexy and palsy very speedily, not only to be inwardly\r\ntaken, but to be hung at their neck. Tragus saith, that the fresh wood\r\nof any Misselto bruised, and the juice drawn forth and dropped in the\r\nears that have imposthumes in them, doth help and ease them within a\r\nfew days.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MONEYWORT, OR HERB TWOPENCE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THE common Moneywort sends forth from a small thready\r\nroot divers long, weak, and slender branches, lying and running upon\r\nthe ground two or three feet long or more, set with leaves two at a\r\njoint one against another at equal distances, which are almost round,\r\nbut pointed at the ends, smooth, and of a good green colour. At the\r\njoints with the leaves from the middle forward come forth at every\r\npoint sometimes one yellow flower, and sometimes two, standing each on\r\na small foot-stalk, and made of five leaves, narrow-pointed at the end,\r\nwith some yellow threads in the middle, which being past, there stand\r\nin their places small round heads of seed.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows plentifully in almost all places of this land,\r\ncommonly in moist grounds by hedge-sides, and in the middle of grassy\r\nfields.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in June and July, and their seed is ripe quickly\r\nafter.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Venus owns it. Moneywort is singularly\r\ngood to stay all fluxes in man or woman, whether they be lasks,\r\nbloody-fluxes, bleeding inwardly or outwardly, or the weakness of the\r\nstomach that is given to casting. It is very good also for the ulcers\r\nor excoriations of the lungs, or other inward parts. It is exceedingly\r\ngood for all wounds, either fresh or green, to heal them speedily,\r\nand for all old ulcers that are of spreading natures. For all which\r\npurposes the juice of the herb, or the powder drank in water wherein\r\nhot steel hath been often quenched; or the decoction of the green herb\r\nin wine or water drank, or used to the outward place, to wash or bathe\r\nthem, or to have tents dipped therein and put into them, are effectual.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MOONWORT.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] IT rises up usually but with one dark green, thick and\r\nflat leaf, standing upon a short foot-stalk not above two fingers\r\nbreadth; but when it flowers it may be said to bear a small slender\r\nstalk about four or five inches high, having but one leaf in the middle\r\nthereof, which is much divided on both sides into sometimes five or\r\nseven parts on a side, sometimes more; each of which parts is small\r\nlike the middle rib, but broad forwards, pointed and round, resembling\r\ntherein a half-moon, from whence it took the name; the uppermost parts\r\nor divisions being bigger than the lowest. The stalks rise above this\r\nleaf two or three inches, bearing many branches of small long tongues,\r\nevery one like the spiky head of the adder’s tongue, of a brownish\r\ncolour, (which, whether I shall call them flowers, or the seed, I well\r\nknow not) which, after they have continued awhile, resolve into a mealy\r\ndust. The root is small and fibrous. This hath sometimes divers such\r\nlike leaves as are before described, with so many branches or tops\r\nrising from one stalk, each divided from the other.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows on hills and heaths, yet where there is much grass,\r\nfor therein it delights to grow.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It is to be found only in April and May; for in June, when\r\nany hot weather comes, for the most part it is withered and gone.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The Moon owns the herb. Moonwort is cold\r\nand drying more than Adder’s Tongue, and is therefore held to be more\r\navailable for all wounds both inward and outward. The leaves boiled\r\nin red wine, and drank, stay the immoderate flux of women’s courses,\r\nand the whites. It also stays bleeding, vomiting, and other fluxes.\r\nIt helps all blows and bruises, and to consolidate all fractures and\r\ndislocations. It is good for ruptures, but is chiefly used, by most\r\nwith other herbs, to make oils or balsams to heal fresh or green\r\nwounds (as I said before) either inward or outward, for which it is\r\nexcellently good.\r\n\r\nMoonwort is an herb which (they say) will open locks, and unshoe such\r\nhorses as tread upon it: This some laugh to scorn, and those no small\r\nfools neither; but country people, that I know, call it Unshoe the\r\nHorse. Besides I have heard commanders say, that on White Down in\r\nDevonshire, near Tiverton, there were found thirty horse shoes, pulled\r\noff from the feet of the Earl of Essex’s horses, being there drawn up\r\nin a body, many of them being but newly shod, and no reason known,\r\nwhich caused much admiration: the herb described usually grows upon\r\nheaths.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MOSSES.\r\n\r\nI SHALL not trouble the reader with a description of these, since my\r\nintent is to speak only of two kinds, as the most principal, viz.\r\nGround Moss and Tree Moss, both which are very well known.\r\n\r\n_Place._] The Ground Moss grows in our moist woods, and at the bottom\r\nof hills, in boggy grounds, and in shadowy ditches and many other such\r\nlike places. The Tree Moss grows only on trees.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] All sorts of Mosses are under the dominion\r\nof Saturn. The Ground Moss is held to be singularly good to break the\r\nstone, and to expel and drive it forth by urine, being boiled in wine\r\nand drank. The herb being bruised and boiled in water, and applied,\r\neases all inflammations and pains coming from an hot cause; and is\r\ntherefore used to ease the pains of the gout.\r\n\r\nThe Tree Mosses are cooling and binding, and partake of a digesting and\r\nmolifying quality withal, as Galen saith. But each Moss partakes of the\r\nnature of the tree from whence it is taken; therefore that of the oak\r\nis more binding, and is of good effect to stay fluxes in man or woman;\r\nas also vomiting or bleeding, the powder thereof being taken in wine.\r\nThe decoction thereof in wine is very good for women to be bathed in,\r\nthat are troubled with the overflowing of their courses. The same being\r\ndrank, stays the stomach that is troubled with casting, or hiccough;\r\nand, as Avicena saith, it comforts the heart. The powder thereof\r\ntaken in drink for some time together, is thought available for the\r\ndropsy. The oil that has had fresh Moss steeped therein for a time, and\r\nafterwards boiled and applied to the temples and forehead, marvellously\r\neases the head-ache coming of a hot cause; as also the distillations of\r\nhot rheums or humours in the eyes, or other parts. The ancients much\r\nused it in their ointments and other medicines against the lassitude,\r\nand to strengthen and comfort the sinews: For which, if it was good\r\nthen, I know no reason but it may be found so still.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MOTHERWORT.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS hath a hard, square, brownish, rough, strong stalk,\r\nrising three or four feet high at least, spreading into many branches,\r\nwhereon grow leaves on each side, with long foot-stalks, two at\r\nevery joint, which are somewhat broad and long, as if it were rough\r\nor crumpled, with many great veins therein of a sad green colour, and\r\ndeeply dented about the edges, and almost divided. From the middle of\r\nthe branches up to the tops of them (which are long and small) grow the\r\nflowers round them at distances, in sharp pointed, rough, hard husks,\r\nof a more red or purple colour than Balm or Horehound, but in the\r\nsame manner or form as the Horehound, after which come small, round,\r\nblackish seeds in great plenty. The root sends forth a number of long\r\nstrings and small fibres, taking strong hold in the ground, of a dark\r\nyellowish or brownish colour, and abides as the Horehound does: the\r\nsmell of the one not much differs from the other.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows only in gardens with us in England.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Venus owns the herb, and it is under Leo.\r\nThere is no better herb to take melancholy vapours from the heart, to\r\nstrengthen it, and make a merry, chearful, blithe soul than this herb.\r\nIt may be kept in a syrup or conserve; therefore the Latins called\r\nit Cardiaca. Besides, it makes women joyful mothers of children, and\r\nsettles their wombs as they should be, therefore we call it Motherwort.\r\nIt is held to be of much use for the trembling of the heart, and\r\nfaintings and swoonings; from whence it took the name Cardiaca. The\r\npowder thereof, to the quantity of a spoonful, drank in wine, is\r\na wonderful help to women in their sore travail, as also for the\r\nsuffocating or risings of the mother, and for these effects, it is\r\nlikely it took the name of Motherwort with us. It also provokes urine\r\nand women’s courses, cleanses the chest of cold phlegm, oppressing it,\r\nkills worms in the belly. It is of good use to warm and dry up the cold\r\nhumours, to digest and disperse them that are settled in the veins,\r\njoints, and sinews of the body, and to help cramps and convulsions.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MOUSE-EAR.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] MOUSE-EAR is a low herb, creeping upon the ground by small\r\nstrings, like the Strawberry plant, whereby it shoots forth small\r\nroots, whereat grow, upon the ground, many small and somewhat short\r\nleaves, set in a round form together, and very hairy, which, being\r\nbroken, do give a whitish milk: From among these leaves spring up two\r\nor three small hoary stalks about a span high, with a few smaller\r\nleaves thereon; at the tops whereof stands usually but one flower,\r\nconsisting of many pale yellow leaves, broad at the point, and a little\r\ndented in, set in three or four rows (the greater uppermost) very like\r\na Dandelion flower, and a little reddish underneath about the edges,\r\nespecially if it grow in a dry ground; which after they have stood long\r\nin flower do turn into down, which with the seed is carried away with\r\nthe wind.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows on ditch banks, and sometimes in ditches, if they be\r\ndry, and in sandy grounds.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers about June or July, and abides green all the Winter.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The Moon owns this herb also; and though\r\nauthors cry out upon Alchymists, for attempting to fix quicksilver by\r\nthis herb and Moonwort, a Roman would not have judged a thing by the\r\nsuccess; if it be to be fixed at all, it is by lunar influence. The\r\njuice thereof taken in wine, or the decoction thereof drank, doth help\r\nthe jaundice, although of long continuance, to drink thereof morning\r\nand evening, and abstain from other drink two or three hours after.\r\nIt is a special remedy against the stone, and the tormenting pains\r\nthereof: as also other tortures and griping pains of the bowels. The\r\ndecoction thereof with Succory and Centaury is held very effectual\r\nto help the dropsy, and them that are inclining thereunto, and the\r\ndiseases of the spleen. It stays the fluxes of blood, either at the\r\nmouth or nose, and inward bleeding also, for it is a singular wound\r\nherb for wounds both inward and outward: It helps the bloody flux, and\r\nhelps the abundance of women’s courses. There is a syrup made of the\r\njuice hereof and sugar, by the apothecaries of Italy, and other places,\r\nwhich is of much account with them, to be given to those that are\r\ntroubled with the cough or phthisic. The same also is singularly good\r\nfor ruptures or burstings. The green herb bruised and presently bound\r\nto any cut or wound, doth quickly solder the lips thereof. And the\r\njuice, decoction, or powder of the dried herb is most singular to stay\r\nthe malignity of spreading and fretting cankers and ulcers whatsoever,\r\nyea in the mouth and secret parts. The distilled water of the plant is\r\navailable in all the diseases aforesaid, and to wash outward wounds and\r\nsores, by applying tents of cloths wet therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MUGWORT.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] COMMON Mugwort hath divers leaves lying upon the ground,\r\nvery much divided, or cut deeply in about the brims, somewhat like\r\nWormwood, but much larger, of a dark green colour on the upper side,\r\nand very hoary white underneath. The stalks rise to be four or five\r\nfeet high, having on it such like leaves as those below, but somewhat\r\nsmaller, branching forth very much towards the top, whereon are set\r\nvery small, pale, yellowish flowers like buttons, which fall away, and\r\nafter them come small seeds inclosed in round heads. The root is long\r\nand hard, with many small fibres growing from it, whereby it takes\r\nstrong hold on the ground; but both stalks and leaves do lie down every\r\nyear, and the root shoots anew in the Spring. The whole plant is of a\r\nreasonable scent, and is more easily propagated by the slips than the\r\nseed.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows plentifully in many places of this land, by the\r\nwater-sides; as also by small water courses, and in divers other places.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers and seeds in the end of Summer.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] This is an herb of Venus, therefore\r\nmaintains the parts of the body she rules, remedies the diseases of\r\nthe parts that are under her signs, Taurus and Libra. Mugwort is with\r\ngood success put among other herbs that are boiled for women to apply\r\nthe hot decoction to draw down their courses, to help the delivery of\r\nthe birth, and expel the after-birth. As also for the obstructions and\r\ninflammations of the mother. It breaks the stone, and opens the urinary\r\npassages where they are stopped. The juice thereof made up with Myrrh,\r\nand put under as a pessary, works the same effects, and so does the\r\nroot also. Being made up with hog’s grease into an ointment, it takes\r\naway wens and hard knots and kernels that grow about the neck and\r\nthroat, and eases the pains about the neck more effectually, if some\r\nField Daisies be put with it. The herb itself being fresh, or the juice\r\nthereof taken, is a special remedy upon the overmuch taking of opium.\r\nThree drams of the powder of the dried leaves taken in wine, is a\r\nspeedy and the best certain help for the sciatica. A decoction thereof\r\nmade with Camomile and Agrimony, and the place bathed therewith while\r\nit is warm, takes away the pains of the sinews, and the cramp.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE MULBERRY-TREE.\r\n\r\nTHIS is so well known where it grows, that it needs no description.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It bears fruit in the months of July and August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Mercury rules the tree, therefore are its\r\neffects variable as his are. The Mulberry is of different parts; the\r\nripe berries, by reason of their sweetness and slippery moisture,\r\nopening the body, and the unripe binding it, especially when they are\r\ndried, and then they are good to stay fluxes, lasks, and the abundance\r\nof women’s courses. The bark of the root kills the broad worms in the\r\nbody. The juice, or the syrup made of the juice of the berries, helps\r\nall inflammations or sores in the mouth, or throat, and palate of the\r\nmouth when it is fallen down. The juice of the leaves is a remedy\r\nagainst the biting of serpents, and for those that have taken aconite.\r\nThe leaves beaten with vinegar, are good to lay on any place that is\r\nburnt with fire. A decoction made of the bark and leaves is good to\r\nwash the mouth and teeth when they ache. If the root be a little slit\r\nor cut, and a small hole made in the ground next thereunto, in the\r\nHarvest-time, it will give out a certain juice, which being hardened\r\nthe next day, is of good use to help the tooth-ache, to dissolve knots,\r\nand purge the belly. The leaves of Mulberries are said to stay bleeding\r\nat the mouth or nose, or the bleeding of the piles, or of a wound,\r\nbeing bound unto the places. A branch of the tree taken when the moon\r\nis at the full, and bound to the wrists of a woman’s arm, whose courses\r\ncome down too much, doth stay them in a short space.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MULLEIN.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] COMMON White Mullein has many fair, large, woolly white\r\nleaves, lying next the ground, somewhat larger than broad, pointed at\r\nthe end, and as it were dented about the edges. The stalk rises up to\r\nbe four or five feet high, covered over with such like leaves, but\r\nless, so that no stalk can be seen for the multitude of leaves thereon\r\nup to the flowers, which come forth on all sides of the stalk, without\r\nany branches for the most part, and are many set together in a long\r\nspike, in some of a yellow colour, in others more pale, consisting of\r\nfive round pointed leaves, which afterwards have small round heads,\r\nwherein is small brownish seed contained. The root is long, white, and\r\nwoody, perishing after it hath borne seed.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows by way-sides and lanes, in many places of this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in July or thereabouts.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of Saturn. A small\r\nquantity of the root given in wine, is commended by Dioscorides,\r\nagainst lasks and fluxes of the belly. The decoction hereof drank, is\r\nprofitable for those that are bursten, and for cramps and convulsions,\r\nand for those that are troubled with an old cough. The decoction\r\nthereof gargled, eases the pains of the tooth-ache. And the oil made\r\nby the often infusion of the flowers, is of very good effect for the\r\npiles. The decoction of the root in red wine or in water, (if there be\r\nan ague) wherein red hot steel hath been often quenched, doth stay the\r\nbloody-flux. The same also opens obstructions of the bladder and reins.\r\nA decoction of the leaves hereof, and of Sage, Marjoram, and Camomile\r\nflowers, and the places bathed therewith, that have sinews stiff with\r\ncold or cramps, doth bring them much ease and comfort. Three ounces of\r\nthe distilled water of the flowers drank morning and evening for some\r\ndays together, is said to be the most excellent remedy for the gout.\r\nThe juice of the leaves and flowers being laid upon rough warts, as\r\nalso the powder of the dried roots rubbed on, doth easily take them\r\naway, but doth no good to smooth warts. The powder of the dried flowers\r\nis an especial remedy for those that are troubled with the belly-ache,\r\nor the pains of the cholic. The decoction of the root, and so likewise\r\nof the leaves, is of great effect to dissolve the tumours, swellings,\r\nor inflammations of the throat. The seed and leaves boiled in wine, and\r\napplied, draw forth speedily thorns or splinters gotten into the flesh,\r\nease the pains, and heal them also. The leaves bruised and wrapped in\r\ndouble papers, and covered with hot ashes and embers to bake a while,\r\nand then taken forth and laid warm on any blotch or boil happening in\r\nthe groin or share, doth dissolve and heal them. The seed bruised and\r\nboiled in wine, and laid on any member that has been out of joint, and\r\nnewly set again, takes away all swelling and pain thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MUSTARD.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] OUR common Mustard hath large and broad rough leaves, very\r\nmuch jagged with uneven and unorderly gashes, somewhat like turnip\r\nleaves, but less and rougher. The stalk rises to be more than a foot\r\nhigh, and sometimes two feet high, being round, rough, and branched at\r\nthe top, bearing such like leaves thereon as grow below, but lesser,\r\nand less divided, and divers yellow flowers one above another at the\r\ntops, after which come small rough pods, with small, lank, flat ends,\r\nwherein is contained round yellowish seed, sharp, hot, and biting upon\r\nthe tongue. The root is small, long, and woody when it bears stalks,\r\nand perishes every year.\r\n\r\n_Place._] This grows with us in gardens only, and other manured places.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It is an annual plant, flowering in July, and the seed is ripe\r\nin August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an excellent sauce for such whose\r\nblood wants clarifying, and for weak stomachs, being an herb of Mars,\r\nbut naught for choleric people, though as good for such as are aged,\r\nor troubled with cold diseases. Aries claims something to do with it,\r\ntherefore it strengthens the heart, and resists poison. Let such whose\r\nstomachs are so weak they cannot digest their meat, or appetite it,\r\ntake of Mustard-seed a dram, Cinnamon as much, and having beaten them\r\nto powder, and half as much Mastich in powder, and with gum Arabic\r\ndissolved in rose-water, make it up into troches, of which they may\r\ntake one of about half a dram weight an hour or two before meals; let\r\nold men and women make much of this medicine, and they will either give\r\nme thanks, or shew manifest ingratitude. Mustard seed hath the virtue\r\nof heat, discussing, ratifying, and drawing out splinters of bones, and\r\nother things of the flesh. It is of good effect to bring down women’s\r\ncourses, for the falling-sickness or lethargy, drowsy forgetful evil,\r\nto use it both inwardly and outwardly, to rub the nostrils, forehead\r\nand temples, to warm and quicken the spirits; for by the fierce\r\nsharpness it purges the brain by sneezing, and drawing down rheum and\r\nother viscous humours, which by their distillations upon the lungs and\r\nchest, procure coughing, and therefore, with some, honey added thereto,\r\ndoth much good therein. The decoction of the seed made in wine, and\r\ndrank, provokes urine, resists the force of poison, the malignity of\r\nmushrooms, and venom of scorpions, or other venomous creatures, if it\r\nbe taken in time; and taken before the cold fits of agues, alters,\r\nlessens, and cures them. The seed taken either by itself, or with other\r\nthings, either in an electuary or drink, doth mightily stir up bodily\r\nlust, and helps the spleen and pains in the sides, and gnawings in the\r\nbowels; and used as a gargle draws up the palate of the mouth, being\r\nfallen down; and also it dissolves the swellings about the throat, if\r\nit be outwardly applied. Being chewed in the mouth it oftentimes helps\r\nthe tooth-ache. The outward application hereof upon the pained place\r\nof the sciatica, discusses the humours, and eases the pains, as also\r\nthe gout, and other joint aches; and is much and often used to ease\r\npains in the sides or loins, the shoulder, or other parts of the body,\r\nupon the plying thereof to raise blisters, and cures the disease by\r\ndrawing it to the outward parts of the body. It is also used to help\r\nthe falling off the hair. The seed bruised mixed with honey, and\r\napplied, or made up with wax, takes away the marks and black and blue\r\nspots of bruises, or the like, the roughness or scabbiness of the skin,\r\nas also the leprosy, and lousy evil. It helps also the crick in the\r\nneck. The distilled water of the herb, when it is in the flower, is\r\nmuch used to drink inwardly to help in any of the diseases aforesaid,\r\nor to wash the mouth when the palate is down, and for the disease of\r\nthe throat to gargle, but outwardly also for scabs, itch, or other the\r\nlike infirmities, and cleanses the face from morphew, spots, freckles,\r\nand other deformities.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE HEDGE-MUSTARD.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS grows up usually but with one blackish green stalk,\r\ntough, easy to bend, but not to break, branched into divers parts, and\r\nsometimes with divers stalks, set full of branches, whereon grow long,\r\nrough, or hard rugged leaves, very much tore or cut on the edges in\r\nmany parts, some bigger, and some less, of a dirty green colour. The\r\nflowers are small and yellow, that grow on the tops of the branches in\r\nlong spikes, flowering by degrees; so that continuing long in flower,\r\nthe stalk will have small round cods at the bottom, growing upright and\r\nclose to the stalk, while the top flowers yet shew themselves, in which\r\nare contained small yellow seed, sharp and strong, as the herb is also.\r\nThe root grows down slender and woody, yet abiding and springing again\r\nevery year.\r\n\r\n_Place._] This grows frequently in this land, by the ways and\r\nhedge-sides, and sometimes in the open fields.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers most usually about July.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Mars owns this herb also. It is singularly\r\ngood in all the diseases of the chest and lungs, hoarseness of voice:\r\nand by the use of the decoction thereof for a little space, those have\r\nbeen recovered who had utterly lost their voice, and almost their\r\nspirits also. The juice thereof made into a syrup, or licking medicine,\r\nwith honey or sugar, is no less effectual for the same purpose, and\r\nfor all other coughs, wheezing, and shortness of breath. The same is\r\nalso profitable for those that have the jaundice, pleurisy, pains in\r\nthe back and loins, and for torments in the belly, or cholic, being\r\nalso used in clysters. The seed is held to be a special remedy against\r\npoison and venom. It is singularly good for the sciatica, and in\r\njoint-aches, ulcers, and cankers in the mouth, throat, or behind the\r\nears, and no less for the hardness and swelling of the testicles, or of\r\nwomen’s breasts.\r\n\r\n\r\n    NAILWORT, OR WHITLOW-GRASS.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS very small and common herb hath no roots, save only\r\na few strings: neither doth it ever grow to be above a hand’s breadth\r\nhigh, the leaves are very small, and something long, not much unlike\r\nthose of Chickweed, among which rise up divers slender stalks, bearing\r\nmany white flowers one above another, which are exceeding small; after\r\nwhich come small flat pouches containing the seed, which is very small,\r\nbut of a sharp taste.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows commonly upon old stone and brick walls, and\r\nsometimes in gravelly grounds, especially if there be grass or moss\r\nnear to shadow it.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower very early in the year, sometimes in January, and\r\nin February; for before the end of April they are not to be found.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is held to be exceedingly good for\r\nthose imposthumes in the joints, and under the nails, which they call\r\nWhitlows, Felons, Andicorns and Nail-wheals.\r\n\r\n\r\n    NEP, OR CATMINT.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] COMMON Garden Nep shoots forth hard four-square stalks,\r\nwith a hoariness on them, a yard high or more, full of branches,\r\nbearing at every joint two broad leaves like balm, but longer pointed,\r\nsofter, white, and more hoary, nicked about the edges, and of a strong\r\nsweet scent. The flowers grow in large tufts at the tops of the\r\nbranches, and underneath them likewise on the stalks many together, of\r\na whitish purple colour. The roots are composed of many long strings\r\nor fibres, fastening themselves stronger in the ground, and abide with\r\ngreen leaves thereon all the winter.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It is only nursed up in our gardens.\r\n\r\n_Time._] And it flowers in July, or thereabouts.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of Venus. Nep is generally\r\nused for women to procure their courses, being taken inwardly or\r\noutwardly, either alone, or with other convenient herbs in a decoction\r\nto bathe them, or sit over the hot fumes thereof; and by the frequent\r\nuse thereof, it takes away barrenness, and the wind, and pains of the\r\nmother. It is also used in pains of the head coming of any cold cause,\r\ncatarrhs, rheums, and for swimming and giddiness thereof, and is of\r\nspecial use for the windiness of the stomach and belly. It is effectual\r\nfor any cramp, or cold aches, to dissolve cold and wind that afflict\r\nthe place, and is used for colds, coughs, and shortness of breath. The\r\njuice thereof drank in wine, is profitable for those that are bruised\r\nby an accident. The green herb bruised and applied to the fundament and\r\nlying there two or three hours, eases the pains of the piles; the juice\r\nalso being made up into an ointment, is effectual for the same purpose.\r\nThe head washed with a decoction thereof, it takes away scabs, and may\r\nbe effectual for other parts of the body also.\r\n\r\n\r\n    NETTLES.\r\n\r\nNETTLES are so well known, that they need no description; they may be\r\nfound by feeling, in the darkest night.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] This is also an herb Mars claims dominion\r\nover. You know Mars is hot and dry, and you know as well that Winter is\r\ncold and moist; then you may know as well the reason why Nettle-tops\r\neaten in the Spring consume the phlegmatic superfluities in the body of\r\nman, that the coldness and moistness of Winter hath left behind. The\r\nroots or leaves boiled, or the juice of either of them, or both made\r\ninto an electuary with honey and sugar, is a safe and sure medicine\r\nto open the pipes and passages of the lungs, which is the cause of\r\nwheezing and shortness of breath, and helps to expectorate tough\r\nphlegm, as also to raise the imposthumed pleurisy; and spend it by\r\nspitting; the same helps the swelling of the almonds of the throat, the\r\nmouth and throat being gargled therewith. The juice is also effectual\r\nto settle the palate of the mouth in its place, and to heal and temper\r\nthe inflammations and soreness of the mouth and throat. The decoction\r\nof the leaves in wine, being drank, is singularly good to provoke\r\nwomen’s courses, and settle the suffocation, strangling of the mother,\r\nand all other diseases thereof; it is also applied outwardly with a\r\nlittle myrrh. The same also, or the seed provokes urine, and expels the\r\ngravel and stone in the reins or bladder, often proved to be effectual\r\nin many that have taken it. The same kills the worms in children, eases\r\npains in the sides, and dissolves the windiness in the spleen, as also\r\nin the body, although others think it only powerful to provoke venery.\r\nThe juice of the leaves taken two or three days together, stays\r\nbleeding at the mouth. The seed being drank, is a remedy against the\r\nstinging of venomous creatures, the biting of mad dogs, the poisonous\r\nqualities of Hemlock, Henbane, Nightshade, Mandrake, or other such\r\nlike herbs that stupify or dull the senses; as also the lethargy,\r\nespecially to use it outwardly, to rub the forehead or temples in the\r\nlethargy, and the places stung or bitten with beasts, with a little\r\nsalt. The distilled water of the herb is also effectual (though not so\r\npowerful) for the diseases aforesaid; as for outward wounds and sores\r\nto wash them, and to cleanse the skin from morphew, leprosy, and other\r\ndiscolourings thereof. The seed or leaves bruised, and put into the\r\nnostrils, stays the bleeding of them, and takes away the flesh growing\r\nin them called polypus. The juice of the leaves, or the decoction of\r\nthem, or of the root, is singularly good to wash either old, rotten,\r\nor stinking sores or fistulous, and gangrenes, and such as fretting,\r\neating, or corroding scabs, manginess, and itch, in any part of the\r\nbody, as also green wounds, by washing them therewith, or applying the\r\ngreen herb bruised thereunto, yea, although the flesh were separated\r\nfrom the bones; the same applied to our wearied members, refresh them,\r\nor to place those that have been out of joint, being first set up\r\nagain, strengthens, dries, and comforts them, as also those places\r\ntroubled with aches and gouts, and the defluxion of humours upon the\r\njoints or sinews; it eases the pains, and dries or dissolves the\r\ndefluctions. An ointment made of the juice, oil, and a little wax, is\r\nsingularly good to rub cold and benumbed members. An handful of the\r\nleaves of green Nettles, and another of Wallwort, or Deanwort, bruised\r\nand applied simply themselves to the gout, sciatica, or joint aches in\r\nany part, hath been found to be an admirable help thereunto.\r\n\r\n\r\n    NIGHTSHADE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] COMMON Nightshade hath an upright, round, green, hollow\r\nstalk, about a foot or half a yard high, bushing forth in many\r\nbranches, whereon grow many green leaves, somewhat broad, and pointed\r\nat the ends, soft and full of juice, somewhat like unto Bazil, but\r\nlonger and a little unevenly dented about the edges: At the tops of the\r\nstalks and branches come forth three or four more white flowers made\r\nof five small pointed leaves a-piece, standing on a stalk together,\r\none above another, with yellow pointels in the middle, composed of\r\nfour or five yellow threads set together, which afterwards run into so\r\nmany pendulous green berries, of the bigness of small pease, full of\r\ngreen juice, and small whitish round flat seed lying within it. The\r\nroot is white, and a little woody when it hath given flower and fruit,\r\nwith many small fibres at it; The whole plant is of a waterish insipid\r\ntaste, but the juice within the berries is somewhat viscous, and of a\r\ncooling and binding quality.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows wild with us under our walls, and in rubbish, the\r\ncommon paths, and sides of hedges and fields, as also in our gardens\r\nhere in England, without any planting.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It lies down every year, and rises up again of its own sowing,\r\nbut springs not until the latter end of April at the soonest.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a cold Saturnine plant. The common\r\nNightshade is wholly used to cool hot inflammations either inwardly\r\nor outwardly, being no ways dangerous to any that use it, as most\r\nof the rest of the Nightshades are; yet it must be used moderately.\r\nThe distilled water only of the whole herb is fittest and safest to\r\nbe taken inwardly: The juice also clarified and taken, being mingled\r\nwith a little vinegar, is good to wash the mouth and throat that is\r\ninflamed: But outwardly the juice of the herb or berries, with oil of\r\nroses and a little vinegar and ceruse laboured together in a leaden\r\nmortar, is very good to anoint all hot inflammations in the eyes. It\r\nalso doth much good for the shingles, ringworms, and in all running,\r\nfretting and corroding ulcers, applied thereunto. The juice dropped\r\ninto the ears, eases pains thereof that arise of heat or inflammations.\r\nAnd Pliny saith, it is good for hot swellings under the throat. Have\r\na care you mistake not the deadly Nightshade for this; if you know\r\nit not, you may let them both alone, and take no harm, having other\r\nmedicines sufficient in the book.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE OAK.\r\n\r\nIT is so well known (the timber thereof being the glory and safety of\r\nthis nation by sea) that it needs no description.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Jupiter owns the tree. The leaves and bark\r\nof the Oak, and the acorn cups, do bind and dry very much. The inner\r\nbark of the tree, and the thin skin that covers the acorn, are most\r\nused to stay the spitting of blood, and the bloody-flux. The decoction\r\nof that bark, and the powder of the cups, do stay vomitings, spitting\r\nof blood, bleeding at the mouth, or other fluxes of blood, in men or\r\nwomen; lasks also, and the nocturnal involuntary flux of men. The acorn\r\nin powder taken in wine, provokes urine, and resists the poison of\r\nvenomous creatures. The decoction of acorns and the bark made in milk\r\nand taken, resists the force of poisonous herbs and medicines, as also\r\nthe virulency of cantharides, when one by eating them hath his bladder\r\nexulcerated, and voids bloody urine. Hippocrates saith, he used the\r\nfumes of Oak leaves to women that were troubled with the strangling\r\nof the mother; and Galen applied them, being bruised, to cure green\r\nwounds. The distilled water of the Oaken bud, before they break out\r\ninto leaves is good to be used either inwardly or outwardly, to assuage\r\ninflammations, and to stop all manner of fluxes in man or woman. The\r\nsame is singularly good in pestilential and hot burning fevers; for\r\nit resists the force of the infection, and allays the heat: It cools\r\nthe heat of the liver, breaking the stone in the kidneys, and stays\r\nwomen’s courses. The decoction of the leaves works the same effects.\r\nThe water that is found in the hollow places of old Oaks, is very\r\neffectual against any foul or spreading scabs. The distilled water (or\r\nconcoction, which is better) of the leaves, is one of the best remedies\r\nthat I know of for the whites in women.\r\n\r\n\r\n    OATS,\r\n\r\nARE so well known that they need no description.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Oats fried with bay salt, and applied to\r\nthe sides, take away the pains of stitches and wind in the sides or\r\nthe belly. A poultice made of meal of Oats, and some oil of Bays put\r\nthereunto, helps the itch and the leprosy, as also the fistulas of the\r\nfundament, and dissolves hard imposthumes. The meal of Oats boiled with\r\nvinegar, and applied, takes away freckles and spots in the face, and\r\nother parts of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ONE BLADE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS small plant never bears more than one leaf, but only\r\nwhen it rises up with his stalk, which thereon bears another, and\r\nseldom more, which are of a blueish green colour, pointed, with many\r\nribs or veins therein, like Plantain. At the top of the stalk grow many\r\nsmall white flowers, star fashion, smelling somewhat sweet; after which\r\ncome small red berries, when they are ripe. The root is small, of the\r\nbigness of a rush, lying and creeping under the upper crust of the\r\nearth, shooting forth in divers places.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in moist, shadowy and grassy places of woods, in\r\nmany parts of this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers about May, and the berries are ripe in June, and\r\nthen quickly perishes, until the next year it springs from the same\r\nroot again.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a precious herb of the Sun. Half a\r\ndram, or a dram at most, in powder of the roots hereof taken in wine\r\nand vinegar, of each equal parts, and the party laid presently to sweat\r\nthereupon, is held to be a sovereign remedy for those that are infected\r\nwith the plague, and have a sore upon them, by expelling the poison and\r\ninfection, and defending the heart and spirits from danger. It is a\r\nsingularly good wound herb, and is thereupon used with other the like\r\neffects in many compound balms for curing of wounds, be they fresh and\r\ngreen, or old and malignant, and especially if the sinews be burnt.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ORCHIS.\r\n\r\nIT has almost as many several names attributed to the several sorts of\r\nit, as would almost fill a sheet of paper; as dog-stones, goat-stones,\r\nfool-stones, fox-stones, satiricon, cullians, together with many others\r\ntoo tedious to rehearse.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] To describe all the several sorts of it were an endless\r\npiece of work; therefore I shall only describe the roots because they\r\nare to be used with some discretion. They have each of them a double\r\nroot within, some of them are round, in others like a hand; these roots\r\nalter every year by course, when the one rises and waxes full, the\r\nother waxes lank, and perishes. Now, it is that which is full which is\r\nto be used in medicines, the other being either of no use at all, or\r\nelse, according to the humour of some, it destroys and disannuls the\r\nvirtues of the other, quite undoing what that doth.\r\n\r\n_Time._] One or other of them may be found in flower from the beginning\r\nof April to the latter end of August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] They are hot and moist in operation, under\r\nthe dominion of Dame Venus, and provoke lust exceedingly, which, they\r\nsay, the dried and withered roots do restrain. They are held to kill\r\nworms in children; as also, being bruised and applied to the place, to\r\nheal the king’s evil.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ONIONS.\r\n\r\nTHEY are so well known, that I need not spend time about writing a\r\ndescription of them.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Mars owns them, and they have gotten this\r\nquality, to draw any corruption to them, for if you peel one, and\r\nlay it upon a dunghill, you shall find it rotten in half a day, by\r\ndrawing putrefaction to it; then, being bruised and applied to a plague\r\nsore, it is very probable it will do the like. Onions are flatulent,\r\nor windy; yet they do somewhat provoke appetite, increase thirst,\r\nease the belly and bowels, provoke women’s courses, help the biting\r\nof a mad dog, and of other venomous creatures, to be used with honey\r\nand rue, increase sperm, especially the seed of them. They also kill\r\nworms in children if they drink the water fasting wherein they have\r\nbeen steeped all night. Being roasted under the embers, and eaten\r\nwith honey or sugar and oil, they much conduce to help an inveterate\r\ncough, and expectorate the cough phlegm. The juice being snuffed up\r\ninto the nostrils, purges the head, and helps the lethargy, (yet the\r\noften eating them is said to procure pains in the head.) It hath been\r\nheld by divers country people a great preservative against infection,\r\nto eat Onions fasting with bread and salt: As also to make a great\r\nOnion hollow, filling the place with good treacle, and after to roast\r\nit well under the embers, which, after taking away the outermost skin\r\nthereof, being beaten together, is a sovereign salve for either plague\r\nor sore, or any other putrefied ulcer. The juice of Onions is good for\r\neither scalding or burning by fire, water, or gunpowder, and used with\r\nvinegar, takes away all blemishes, spots and marks in the skin: and\r\ndropped in the ears, eases the pains and noise of them. Applied also\r\nwith figs beaten together, helps to ripen and break imposthumes, and\r\nother sores.\r\n\r\nLeeks are as like them in quality, as the pome-water is like an apple:\r\nThey are a remedy against a surfeit of mushrooms, being baked under\r\nthe embers and taken, and being boiled and applied very warm, help\r\nthe piles. In other things they have the same property as the Onions,\r\nalthough not so effectual.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ORPINE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] COMMON Orpine rises up with divers rough brittle stalks,\r\nthick set with fat and fleshy leaves, without any order, and little\r\nor nothing dented about the edges, of a green colour: The flowers are\r\nwhite, or whitish, growing in tufts, after which come small chaffy\r\nhusks, with seeds like dust in them. The roots are divers thick, round,\r\nwhite tuberous clogs; and the plant grows not so big in some places as\r\nin others where it is found.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It is frequent in almost every county of this land, and is\r\ncherished in gardens with us, where it grows greater than that which is\r\nwild, and grows in shadowy sides of fields and woods.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers about July, and the seed is ripe in August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The Moon owns the herb, and he that knows\r\nbut her exaltaration, knows what I say is true. Orpine is seldom used\r\nin inward medicines with us, although Tragus saith from experience in\r\nGermany, that the distilled water thereof is profitable for gnawings\r\nor excoriations in the stomach or bowels, or for ulcers in the lungs,\r\nliver, or other inward parts, as also in the matrix, and helps all\r\nthose diseases, being drank for certain days together. It stays the\r\nsharpness of humours in the bloody-flux, and other fluxes in the body,\r\nor in wounds. The root thereof also performs the like effect. It is\r\nused outwardly to cool any heat or inflammation upon any hurt or wound,\r\nand eases the pains of them; as, also, to heal scaldings or burnings,\r\nthe juice thereof being beaten with some green sallad oil, and\r\nanointed. The leaf bruised, and laid to any green wound in the hand or\r\nlegs, doth heal them quickly; and being bound to the throat, much helps\r\nthe quinsy; it helps also ruptures and burstenness. If you please to\r\nmake the juice thereof into a syrup with honey or sugar, you may safely\r\ntake a spoonful or two at a time, (let my author say what he will) for\r\na quinsy, and you shall find the medicine pleasant, and the cure speedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PARSLEY.\r\n\r\nTHIS is so well known, that it needs no description.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of Mercury; is very\r\ncomfortable to the stomach; helps to provoke urine and women’s courses,\r\nto break wind both in the stomach and bowels, and doth a little open\r\nthe body, but the root much more. It opens obstructions both of liver\r\nand spleen, and is therefore accounted one of the five opening roots.\r\nGalen commended it against the falling sickness, and to provoke urine\r\nmightily; especially if the roots be boiled, and eaten like Parsnips.\r\nThe seed is effectual to provoke urine and women’s courses, to expel\r\nwind, to break the stone, and ease the pains and torments thereof;\r\nit is also effectual against the venom of any poisonous creature,\r\nand the danger that comes to them that have the lethargy, and is as\r\ngood against the cough. The distilled water of Parsley is a familiar\r\nmedicine with nurses to give their children when they are troubled\r\nwith wind in the stomach or belly which they call the frets; and is\r\nalso much available to them that are of great years. The leaves of\r\nParsley laid to the eyes that are inflamed with heat, or swollen, doth\r\nmuch help them, if it be used with bread or meal; and being fried\r\nwith butter, and applied to women’s breasts that are hard through the\r\ncurdling of their milk, it abates the hardness quickly; and also takes\r\naway black and blue marks coming of bruises or falls. The juice thereof\r\ndropped into the ears with a little wine, eases the pains. Tragus sets\r\ndown an excellent medicine to help the jaundice and falling sickness,\r\nthe dropsy, and stone in the kidneys, in this manner: Take of the seed\r\nof Parsley, Fennel, Annise and Carraways, of each an ounce; of the\r\nroots of Parsley, Burnet, Saxifrage, and Carraways, of each an ounce\r\nand an half; let the seeds be bruised, and the roots washed and cut\r\nsmall; let them lie all night to steep in a bottle of white wine, and\r\nin the morning be boiled in a close earthen vessel until a third part\r\nor more be wasted; which being strained and cleared, take four ounces\r\nthereof morning and evening first and last, abstaining from drink after\r\nit for three hours. This opens obstructions of the liver and spleen,\r\nand expels the dropsy and jaundice by urine.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PARSLEY PIERT, OR PARSLEY BREAK\r\n    STONE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THE root, although it be very small and thready, yet it\r\ncontinues many years, from which arise many leaves lying along on the\r\nground, each standing upon a long small foot-stalk, the leaves as broad\r\nas a man’s nail, very deeply dented on the edges, somewhat like a\r\nparsley-leaf, but of a very dusky green colour. The stalks are very\r\nweak and slender, about three or four fingers in length, set so full\r\nof leaves that they can hardly be seen, either having no foot-stalk at\r\nall, or but very short; the flowers are so small they can hardly be\r\nseen, and the seed as small as may be.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It is a common herb throughout the nation, and rejoices\r\nin barren, sandy, moist places. It may be found plentifully about\r\nHampstead Heath, Hyde Park, and in Tothill-fields.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It may be found all the Summer-time, even from the beginning\r\nof April to the end of October.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Its operation is very prevalent to provoke\r\nurine, and to break the stone. It is a very good sallad herb. It were\r\ngood the gentry would pickle it up as they pickle up Samphire for\r\ntheir use all the Winter. I cannot teach them how to do it; yet this\r\nI can tell them, it is a very wholesome herb. They may also keep the\r\nherb dry, or in a syrup, if they please. You may take a dram of the\r\npowder of it in white wine; it would bring away gravel from the kidneys\r\ninsensibly, and without pain. It also helps the stranguary.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PARSNIPS.\r\n\r\nTHE garden kind thereof is so well known (the root being commonly\r\neaten) that I shall not trouble you with any description of it. But the\r\nwild kind being of more physical use, I shall in this place describe it\r\nunto you.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The wild Parsnip differs little from the garden, but\r\ngrows not so fair and large, nor hath so many leaves, and the root is\r\nshorter, more woody, and not so fit to be eaten, and therefore more\r\nmedicinal.\r\n\r\n_Place._] The name of the first shews the place of its growth. The\r\nother grows wild in divers places, as in the marshes in Rochester,\r\nand elsewhere, and flowers in July; the seed being ripe about the\r\nbeginning of August, the second year after its sowing; for if they do\r\nflower the first year, the country people call them Madneps.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The garden Parsnips are under Venus. The\r\ngarden Parsnip nourishes much, and is good and wholesome nourishment,\r\nbut a little windy, whereby it is thought to procure bodily lust; but\r\nit fastens the body much, if much need. It is conducible to the stomach\r\nand reins, and provokes urine. But the wild Parsnips hath a cutting,\r\nattenuating, cleansing, and opening quality therein. It resists and\r\nhelps the bitings of serpents, eases the pains and stitches in the\r\nsides, and dissolves wind both in the stomach and bowels, which is the\r\ncholic, and provokes urine. The root is often used, but the seed much\r\nmore. The wild being better than the tame, shews Dame Nature to be the\r\nbest physician.\r\n\r\n\r\n    COW PARSNIPS.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS grows with three or four large, spread winged, rough\r\nleaves, lying often on the ground, or else raised a little from it,\r\nwith long, round, hairy foot-stalks under them, parted usually into\r\nfive divisions, the two couples standing each against the other; and\r\none at the end, and each leaf, being almost round, yet somewhat deeply\r\ncut in on the edges in some leaves, and not so deep in others, of a\r\nwhitish green colour, smelling somewhat strongly; among which rises\r\nup a round, crusted, hairy stalk, two or three feet high, with a few\r\njoints and leaves thereon, and branched at the top, where stand large\r\numbels of white, and sometimes reddish flowers, and after them flat,\r\nwhitish, thin, winged seed, two always joined together. The root is\r\nlong and white, with two or three long strings growing down into the\r\nground, smelling likewise strongly and unpleasant.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in moist meadows, and the borders and corners of\r\nfields, and near ditches, through this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in July, and seeds in August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Mercury hath the dominion over them. The\r\nseed thereof, as Galen saith, is of a sharp and cutting quality, and\r\ntherefore is a fit medicine for a cough and shortness of breath,\r\nthe falling sickness and jaundice. The root is available to all the\r\npurposes aforesaid, and is also of great use to take away the hard skin\r\nthat grows on a fistula, if it be but scraped upon it. The seed hereof\r\nbeing drank, cleanses the belly from tough phlegmatic matter therein,\r\neases them that are liver-grown, women’s passions of the mother, as\r\nwell being drank as the smoke thereof received, and likewise raises\r\nsuch as are fallen into a deep sleep, or have the lethargy, by burning\r\nit under their nose. The seed and root boiled in oil, and the head\r\nrubbed therewith, helps not only those that are fallen into a frenzy,\r\nbut also the lethargy or drowsy evil, and those that have been long\r\ntroubled with the head-ache, if it be likewise used with Rue. It helps\r\nalso the running scab and shingles. The juice of the flowers dropped\r\ninto the ears that run and are full of matter, cleanses and heals them.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE PEACH TREE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] A PEACH tree grows not so great as the Apricot tree, yet\r\nspreads branches reasonable well, from whence spring smaller reddish\r\ntwigs, whereon are set long and narrow green leaves dented about the\r\nedges. The blossoms are greater than the plumb, and of a light purple\r\ncolour; the fruit round, and sometimes as big as a reasonable Pippin,\r\nothers smaller, as also differing in colour and taste, as russet, red,\r\nor yellow, waterish or firm, with a frize or cotton all over, with a\r\ncleft therein like an Apricot, and a rugged, furrowed, great stone\r\nwithin it, and a bitter kernel within the stone. It sooner waxes old,\r\nand decays, than the Apricot, by much.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They are nursed in gardens and orchards through this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in the Spring, and fructify in Autumn.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Lady Venus owns this tree, and by it opposes\r\nthe ill effects of Mars, and indeed for children and young people,\r\nnothing is better to purge choler and the jaundice, than the leaves or\r\nflowers of this tree being made into a syrup or conserve. Let such as\r\ndelight to please their lust regard the fruit; but such as have lost\r\ntheir health, and their children’s, let them regard what I say, they\r\nmay safely give two spoonfuls of the syrup at a time; it is as gentle\r\nas Venus herself. The leaves of peaches bruised and laid on the belly,\r\nkill worms, and so they do also being boiled in ale and drank, and\r\nopen the belly likewise; and, being dried, is a far safer medicine to\r\ndiscuss humours. The powder of them strewed upon fresh bleeding wounds\r\nstays their bleeding, and closes them up. The flowers steeped all\r\nnight in a little wine standing warm, strained forth in the morning,\r\nand drank fasting, doth gently open the belly, and move it downward. A\r\nsyrup made of them, as the syrup of roses is made, works more forcibly\r\nthan that of roses, for it provokes vomiting, and spends waterish and\r\nhydropic humours by the continuance thereof. The flowers made into a\r\nconserve, work the same effect. The liquor that dropped from the tree,\r\nbeing wounded, is given in the decoction of Coltsfoot, to those that\r\nare troubled with a cough or shortness of breath, by adding thereunto\r\nsome sweet wine, and putting some saffron also therein. It is good for\r\nthose that are hoarse, or have lost their voice; helps all defects\r\nof the lungs, and those that vomit and spit blood. Two drams hereof\r\ngiven in the juice of lemons, or of radish, is good for them that are\r\ntroubled with the stone, the kernels of the stones do wonderfully ease\r\nthe pains and wringings of the belly through wind or sharp humours, and\r\nhelp to make an excellent medicine for the stone upon all occasions,\r\nin this manner: _I take fifty kernels of peach-stones, and one hundred\r\nof the kernels of cherry-stones, a handful of elder flowers fresh or\r\ndried, and three pints of Muscadel; set them in a close pot into a bed\r\nof horse-dung for ten days, after which distil in a glass with a gentle\r\nfire_, and keep it for your use: You may drink upon occasion three or\r\nfour ounces at a time. The milk or cream of these kernels being drawn\r\nforth with some Vervain water and applied to the forehead and temples,\r\ndoth much help to procure rest and sleep to sick persons wanting it.\r\nThe oil drawn from the kernels, the temples being therewith anointed,\r\ndoth the like. The said oil put into clysters, eases the pains of the\r\nwind cholic: and anointed on the lower part of the belly, doth the\r\nlike, and dropped into the ears, eases pains in them; the juice of the\r\nleaves doth the like. Being also anointed on the forehead and temples,\r\nit helps the megrim, and all other pains in the head. If the kernels\r\nbe bruised and boiled in vinegar, until they become thick, and applied\r\nto the head, it marvellously procures the hair to grow again upon bald\r\nplaces, or where it is too thin.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE PEAR TREE.\r\n\r\nPEAR Trees are so well known, that they need no description.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The Tree belongs to Venus, and so doth the\r\nApple tree. For their physical use they are best discerned by their\r\ntaste. All the sweet and luscious sorts, whether manured or wild, do\r\nhelp to move the belly downwards, more or less. Those that are hard and\r\nsour, do, on the contrary, bind the belly as much, and the leaves do\r\nso also: Those that are moist do in some sort cool, but harsh or wild\r\nsorts much more, and are very good in repelling medicines; and if the\r\nwild sort be boiled with mushrooms, it makes them less dangerous. The\r\nsaid Pears boiled with a little honey, help much the oppressed stomach,\r\nas all sorts of them do, some more, some less: but the harsher sorts\r\ndo more cool and bind, serving well to be bound to green wounds, to\r\ncool and stay the blood, and heal up the green wound without farther\r\ntrouble, or inflammation, as Galen saith he hath found by experience.\r\nThe wild Pears do sooner close up the lips of green wounds than others.\r\n\r\nSchola Selerni advises to drink much wine after Pears, or else (say\r\nthey) they are as bad as poison; nay, and they curse the tree for it\r\ntoo; but if a poor man find his stomach oppressed by eating Pears, it\r\nis but working hard, and it will do as well as drinking wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PELLITORY OF SPAIN.\r\n\r\nCOMMON Pellitory of Spain, if it be planted in our gardens, will\r\nprosper very well; yet there is one sort growing ordinarily here wild,\r\nwhich I esteem to be little inferior to the other, if at all. I shall\r\nnot deny you the description of them both.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] Common Pellitory is a very common plant, and will not be\r\nkept in our gardens without diligent looking to. The root goes down\r\nright into the ground bearing leaves, being long and finely cut upon\r\nthe stalk, lying on the ground, much larger than the leaves of the\r\nCamomile are. At the top it bears one single large flower at a place,\r\nhaving a border of many leaves, white on the upper side, and reddish\r\nunderneath, with a yellow thrum in the middle, not standing so close as\r\nthat of Camomile.\r\n\r\nThe other common Pellitory which grows here, hath a root of a sharp\r\nbiting taste, scarcely discernible by the taste from that before\r\ndescribed, from whence arise divers brittle stalks, a yard high and\r\nmore, with narrow leaves finely dented about the edges, standing one\r\nabove another up to the tops. The flowers are many and white, standing\r\nin tufts like those of Yarrow, with a small yellowish thrum in the\r\nmiddle. The seed is very small.\r\n\r\n_Place._] The last grows in fields by the hedge sides and paths, almost\r\nevery where.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers at the latter end of June and July.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the government of Mercury, and\r\nI am persuaded it is one of the best purgers of the brain that grows.\r\nAn ounce of the juice taken in a draught of Muskadel an hour before the\r\nfit of the ague comes, it will assuredly drive away the ague at the\r\nsecond or third time taken at the farthest. Either the herb or root\r\ndried and chewed in the mouth, purges the brain of phlegmatic humours;\r\nthereby not only easing pains in the head and teeth, but also hinders\r\nthe distilling of the brain upon the lungs and eyes, thereby preventing\r\ncoughs, phthisicks and consumption, the apoplexy and falling sickness.\r\nIt is an excellently approved remedy in the lethargy. The powder of\r\nthe herb or root being snuffed up the nostrils, procures sneezing, and\r\neases the head-ache; being made into an ointment with hog’s grease, it\r\ntakes away black and blue spots occasioned by blows or falls, and helps\r\nboth the gout and sciatica.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PELLITORY OF THE WALL.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] IT rises with brownish, red, tender, weak, clear, and\r\nalmost transparent stalks, about two feet high, upon which grow at the\r\njoints two leaves somewhat broad and long, of a dark green colour,\r\nwhich afterwards turn brownish, smooth on the edges, but rough and\r\nhairy, as the stalks are also. At the joints with the leaves from the\r\nmiddle of the stalk upwards, where it spreads into branches, stand many\r\nsmall, pale, purplish flowers in hairy, rough heads, or husks, after\r\nwhich come small, black, rough seed, which will stick to any cloth\r\nor garment that shall touch it. The root is somewhat long, with small\r\nfibres thereat, of a dark reddish colour, which abides the Winter,\r\nalthough the stalks and leaves perish and spring every year.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows wild generally through the land, about the borders\r\nof fields, and by the sides of walls, and among rubbish. It will endure\r\nwell being brought up in gardens, and planted on the shady side, where\r\nit will spring of its own sowing.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in June and July, and the seed is ripe soon after.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of Mercury. The\r\ndried herb Pellitory made up into an electuary with honey, or the\r\njuices of the herb, or the decoction thereof made up with sugar or\r\nhoney, is a singular remedy for an old or dry cough, the shortness of\r\nbreath, and wheezing in the throat. Three ounces of the juice thereof\r\ntaken at a time, doth wonderfully help stopping of the urine, and to\r\nexpel the stone or gravel in the kidneys or bladder, and is therefore\r\nusually put among other herbs used in clysters to mitigate pains in\r\nthe back, sides, or bowels, proceeding of wind, stopping of urine, the\r\ngravel or stone, as aforesaid. If the bruised herb, sprinkled with\r\nsome Muskadel, be warmed upon a tile, or in a dish upon a few quick\r\ncoals in a chafing-dish, and applied to the belly, it works the same\r\neffect. The decoction of the herb being drank, eases pains of the\r\nmother, and brings down women’s courses: It also eases those griefs\r\nthat arise from obstructions of the liver, spleen, and reins. The same\r\ndecoction, with a little honey added thereto, is good to gargle a\r\nsore throat. The juice held a while in the mouth, eases pains in the\r\nteeth. The distilled water of the herb drank with some sugar, works\r\nthe same effects, and cleanses the skin from spots, freckles, purples,\r\nwheals, sun-burn, morphew, &c. The juice dropped into the ears, eases\r\nthe noise in them, and takes away the pricking and shooting pains\r\ntherein: The same, or the distilled water, assuages hot and swelling\r\nimposthumes, burnings and scaldings by fire or water; as also all\r\nother hot tumours and inflammations, or breakings-out, of heat, being\r\nbathed often with wet cloths dipped therein: The said juice made into\r\na liniment with ceruss, and oil of roses, and anointed therewith,\r\ncleanses foul rotten ulcers, and stays spreading or creeping ulcers,\r\nand running scabs or sores in children’s heads; and helps to stay the\r\nhair from falling off the head. The said ointment, or the herb applied\r\nto the fundament, opens the piles, and eases their pains; and being\r\nmixed with goats’ tallow, helps the gout. The juice is very effectual\r\nto cleanse fistulas, and to heal them up safely; or the herb itself\r\nbruised and applied with a little salt. It is likewise also effectual\r\nto heal any green wound; if it be bruised and bound thereto for three\r\ndays, you shall need no other medicine to heal it further. A poultice\r\nmade hereof with Mallows, and boiled in wine and wheat bran and bean\r\nflour, and some oil put thereto, and applied warm to any bruised\r\nsinews, tendon, or muscle, doth in a very short time restore them to\r\ntheir strength, taking away the pains of the bruises, and dissolves the\r\ncongealed blood coming of blows, or falls from high places.\r\n\r\nThe juice of Pellitory of the Wall clarified and boiled in a syrup with\r\nhoney, and a spoonful of it drank every morning by such as are subject\r\nto the dropsy; if continuing that course, though but once a week, they\r\never have the dropsy, let them but come to me, and I will cure them\r\n_gratis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PENNYROYAL.\r\n\r\nPENNYROYAL is so well known unto all, I mean the common kind, that it\r\nneeds no description.\r\n\r\nThere is a greater kind than the ordinary sort found wild with us,\r\nwhich so abides, being brought into gardens, and differs not from it,\r\nbut only in the largeness of the leaves and stalks, in rising higher,\r\nand not creeping upon the ground so much. The flowers whereof are\r\npurple, growing in rundles about the stalks like the other.\r\n\r\n_Place._] The first, which is common in gardens, grows also in many\r\nmoist and watery places of this land.\r\n\r\nThe second is found wild in effect in divers places by the highways\r\nfrom London to Colchester, and thereabouts, more abundantly than in any\r\nother counties, and is also planted in their gardens in Essex.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in the latter end of Summer, about August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The herb is under Venus. Dioscorides saith,\r\nthat Pennyroyal makes thin tough phlegm, warms the coldness of any part\r\nwhereto it is applied, and digests raw or corrupt matter; Being boiled\r\nand drank, it provokes women’s courses, and expels the dead child and\r\nafter-birth, and stays the disposition to vomit, being taken in water\r\nand vinegar mingled together. And being mingled with honey and salt,\r\nit voids phlegm out of the lungs, and purges melancholy by the stool.\r\nDrank with wine, it helps such as are bitten and stung with venomous\r\nbeasts, and applied to the nostrils with vinegar, revives those that\r\nare fainting and swooning. Being dried and burnt, it strengthens the\r\ngums. It is helpful to those that are troubled with the gout, being\r\napplied of itself to the place until it was red; and applied in a\r\nplaister, it takes away spots or marks in the face; applied with salt,\r\nit profits those that are splenetic, or livergrown. The decoction doth\r\nhelp the itch, if washed therewith. The green herb bruised and put into\r\nvinegar, cleanses foul ulcers, and takes away the marks of bruises and\r\nblows about the eyes, and all discolourings of the face by fire, yea,\r\nand the leprosy, being drank and outwardly applied: Boiled in wine\r\nwith honey and salt, it helps the tooth-ache. It helps the cold griefs\r\nby the joints, taking away the pains, and warms the cold part, being\r\nfast bound to the place, after a bathing or sweating in a hot house.\r\nPliny adds, that Pennyroyal and Mints together, help faintings, being\r\nput into vinegar, and smelled unto, or put into the nostrils or mouth.\r\nIt eases head-aches, pains of the breast and belly, and gnawings of\r\nthe stomach; applied with honey, salt, and vinegar, it helps cramps or\r\nconvulsions of the sinews: Boiled in milk, and drank, it is effectual\r\nfor the cough, and for ulcers and sores in the mouth; drank in wine it\r\nprovokes women’s courses, and expels the dead child, and after-birth.\r\nMatthiolus saith, The decoction thereof being drank, helps the jaundice\r\nand dropsy, all pains of the head and sinews that come of a cold cause,\r\nand clears the eye-sight. It helps the lethargy, and applied with\r\nbarley-meal, helps burnings; and put into the ears, eases the pains of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MALE AND FEMALE PEONY.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] MALE Peony rises up with brownish stalks, whereon grow\r\ngreen and reddish leaves, upon a stalk without any particular division\r\nin the leaf at all. The flowers stand at the top of the stalks,\r\nconsisting of five or six broad leaves, of a fair purplish red colour,\r\nwith many yellow threads in the middle standing about the head, which\r\nafter rises up to be the seed vessels, divided into two, three, or\r\nfour crooked pods like horns, which being full ripe, open and turn\r\nthemselves down backwards, shewing with them divers round, black,\r\nshining seeds, having also many crimson grains, intermixed with black,\r\nwhereby it makes a very pretty shew. The roots are great, thick and\r\nlong, spreading and running down deep in the ground.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary Female Peony hath as many stalks, and more leaves on them\r\nthan the Male; the leaves not so large, but nicked on the edges, some\r\nwith great and deep, others with small cuts and divisions, of a dead\r\ngreen colour. The flowers are of a strong heady scent, usually smaller,\r\nand of a more purple colour than the Male, with yellow thrums about\r\nthe head, as the Male hath. The seed vessels are like horns, as in\r\nthe Male, but smaller, the seed is black, but less shining. The root\r\nconsists of many short tuberous clogs, fastened at the end of long\r\nstrings, and all from the heads of the roots, which is thick and short,\r\nand of the like scent with the Male.\r\n\r\n_Place and Time._] They grow in gardens, and flower usually about May.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of the Sun, and under the\r\nLion. Physicians say, Male Peony roots are best; but Dr. Reason told\r\nme Male Peony was best for men, and Female Peony for women, and he\r\ndesires to be judged by his brother Dr. Experience. The roots are\r\nheld to be of more virtue than the seed; next the flowers; and, last\r\nof all, the leaves. The roots of the Male Peony, fresh gathered,\r\nhaving been found by experience to cure the falling sickness; but the\r\nsurest way is, besides hanging it about the neck, by which children\r\nhave been cured, to take the root of the Male Peony washed clean, and\r\nstamped somewhat small, and laid to infuse in sack for 24 hours at the\r\nleast, afterwards strain it, and take it first and last, morning and\r\nevening, a good draught for sundry days together, before and after a\r\nfull moon: and this will also cure old persons, if the disease be not\r\ngrown too old, and past cure, especially if there be a due and orderly\r\npreparation of the body with posset-drink made of Betony, &c. The\r\nroot is also effectual for women that are not sufficiently cleansed\r\nafter child-birth, and such as are troubled with the mother; for\r\nwhich likewise the black seed beaten to powder, and given in wine,\r\nis also available. The black seed also taken before bed-time, and in\r\nthe morning, is very effectual for such as in their sleep are troubled\r\nwith the disease called Ephialtes, or Incubus, but we do commonly call\r\nit the Night-mare: a disease which melancholy persons are subject\r\nunto: It is also good against melancholy dreams. The distilled water\r\nor syrup made of the flowers, works the same effects that the root\r\nand seed do, although more weakly. The Female’s is often used for the\r\npurpose aforesaid, by reason the Male is so scarce a plant, that it is\r\npossessed by few, and those great lovers of rarities in this kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEPPERWORT, OR DITTANDER.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] OUR common Pepperwort sends forth somewhat long and broad\r\nleaves, of a light blueish green colour, finely dented about the edges,\r\nand pointed at the ends, standing upon round hard stalks, three or\r\nfour feet high, spreading many branches on all sides, and having many\r\nsmall white flowers at the tops of them, after which follow small seeds\r\nin small heads. The root is slender, running much under ground, and\r\nshooting up again in many places, and both leaves and roots are very\r\nhot and sharp of taste, like pepper, for which cause it took the name.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows naturally in many places of this land, as at Clare\r\nin Essex; also near unto Exeter in Devonshire; upon Rochester common\r\nin Kent; in Lancashire, and divers other places; but usually kept in\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in the end of June, and in July.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Here is another martial herb for you, make\r\nmuch of it. Pliny and Paulus Ægineta say, that Pepperwort is very\r\nsuccessful for the sciatica, or any other gout or pain in the joints,\r\nor any other inveterate grief: The leaves hereof to be bruised, and\r\nmixed with old hog’s grease, and applied to the place, and to continue\r\nthereon four hours in men, and two hours in women, the place being\r\nafterwards bathed with wine and oil mixed together, and then wrapped up\r\nwith wool or skins, after they have sweat a little. It also amends the\r\ndeformities or discolourings of the skin, and helps to take away marks,\r\nscars, and scabs, or the foul marks of burning with fire or iron. The\r\njuice hereof is by some used to be given in ale to drink, to women with\r\nchild, to procure them a speedy delivery in travail.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PERIWINKLE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THE common sort hereof hath many branches trailing or\r\nrunning upon the ground, shooting out small fibres at the joints as it\r\nruns, taking thereby hold in the ground, and rooteth in divers places.\r\nAt the joints of these branches stand two small, dark-green, shining\r\nleaves, somewhat like bay leaves, but smaller, and with them come forth\r\nalso the flowers (one at a joint) standing upon a tender foot-stalk,\r\nbeing somewhat long and hollow, parted at the brims, sometimes into\r\nfour, sometimes into five leaves: The most ordinary sorts are of a pale\r\nblue colour; some are pure white, some of a dark reddish purple colour.\r\nThe root is little bigger than a rush, bushing in the ground, and\r\ncreeping with his branches far about, whereby it quickly possesses a\r\ngreat compass, and is therefore most usually planted under hedges where\r\nit may have room to run.\r\n\r\n_Place._] Those with the pale blue, and those with the white flowers,\r\ngrow in woods and orchards, by the hedge-sides, in divers places of\r\nthis land; but those with the purple flowers, in gardens only.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in March and April.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Venus owns this herb, and saith, That the\r\nleaves eaten by man and wife together, cause love between them. The\r\nPeriwinkle is a great binder, stays bleeding both at mouth and nose,\r\nif some of the leaves be chewed. The French used it to stay women’s\r\ncourses. Dioscorides, Galen, and Ægineta, commend it against the lasks\r\nand fluxes of the belly to be drank in wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ST. PETER’S WORT.\r\n\r\nIF Superstition had not been the father of Tradition, as well as\r\nIgnorance the Mother of Devotion, this herb, (as well as St. John’s\r\nWort) hath found some other name to be known by; but we may say of our\r\nforefathers, as St. Paul of the Athenians, _I perceive in many things\r\nyou are too superstitious_. Yet seeing it is come to pass, that custom\r\nhaving got in possession, pleads prescription for the name, I shall let\r\nit pass, and come to the description of the herb, which take as follows.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] It rises up with square upright stalks for the most part,\r\nsome greater and higher than St. John’s Wort (and good reason too, St.\r\nPeter being the greater apostle, (ask the Pope else;) for though God\r\nwould have the saints equal, the Pope is of another opinion,) but brown\r\nin the same manner, having two leaves at every joint, somewhat like,\r\nbut larger, than St. John’s Wort, and a little rounder pointed, with\r\nfew or no holes to be seen thereon, and having sometimes some smaller\r\nleaves rising from the bosom of the greater, and sometimes a little\r\nhairy also. At the tops of two stalks stand many star-like flowers,\r\nwith yellow threads in the middle, very like those of St. John’s\r\nWort, insomuch that this is hardly discerned from it, but only by the\r\nlargeness and height, the seed being alike also in both. The root\r\nabides long, sending forth new shoots every year.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in many groves, and small low woods, in divers\r\nplaces of this land, as in Kent, Huntingdon, Cambridge, and\r\nNorthamptonshire; as also near water-courses in other places.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in June and July, and the seed is ripe in August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] There is not a straw to choose between this\r\nand St. John’s Wort, only St. Peter must have it, lest he should want\r\npot herbs; It is of the same property of St. John’s Wort, but somewhat\r\nweaker, and therefore more seldom used. Two drams of the seed taken at\r\na time in honied water, purges choleric humours, (as saith Dioscorides,\r\nPliny, and Galen,) and thereby helps those that are troubled with the\r\nsciatica. The leaves are used as St. John’s Wort, to help those places\r\nof the body that have been burnt with fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PIMPERNEL.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] COMMON Pimpernel hath divers weak square stalks lying\r\non the ground, beset all with two small and almost round leaves at\r\nevery joint, one against another, very like Chickweed, but hath no\r\nfoot-stalks; for the leaves, as it were, compase the stalk. The flowers\r\nstand singly each by themselves at them and the stalk, consisting of\r\nfive small round-pointed leaves, of a pale red colour, tending to an\r\norange, with so many threads in the middle, in whose places succeed\r\nsmooth round heads, wherein is contained small seed. The root is small\r\nand fibrous, perishing every year.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows almost every where as well in the meadows and\r\ncorn-fields, as by the way-sides, and in gardens, arising of itself.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers from May until April, and the seed ripens in the\r\nmean time, and falls.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a gallant solar herb, of a cleansing\r\nattractive quality, whereby it draws forth thorns or splinters, or\r\nother such like things gotten into the flesh; and put up into the\r\nnostrils, purges the head; and Galen saith also, they have a drying\r\nfaculty, whereby they are good to solder the lips of wounds, and to\r\ncleanse foul ulcers. The distilled water or juice is much esteemed by\r\nFrench dames to cleanse the skin from any roughness and deformity, or\r\ndiscolouring thereof; being boiled in wine and given to drink, it is\r\na good remedy against the plague, and other pestilential fevers, if\r\nthe party after taking it be warm in his bed, and sweat for two hours\r\nafter, and use the same for twice at least. It helps also all stingings\r\nand bitings of venomous beasts, or mad dogs, being used inwardly, and\r\napplied outwardly. The same also opens obstructions of the liver, and\r\nis very available against the infirmities of the reins: It provokes\r\nurine, and helps to expel the stone and gravel out of the kidneys and\r\nbladder, and helps much in all inward pains and ulcers. The decoction,\r\nor distilled water, is no less effectual to be applied to all wounds\r\nthat are fresh and green, or old, filthy, fretting, and running ulcers,\r\nwhich it very effectually cures in a short space. A little mixed with\r\nthe juice, and dropped into the eyes, cleanses them from cloudy mists,\r\nor thick films which grow over them, and hinder the sight. It helps the\r\ntooth-ache, being dropped into the ear on a contrary side of the pain.\r\nIt is also effectual to ease the pains of the hæmorrhoids or piles.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GROUND PINE, OR CHAMEPITYS.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] OUR common Ground Pine grows low, seldom rising above a\r\nhand’s breadth high, shooting forth divers small branches, set with\r\nslender, small, long, narrow, greyish, or whitish leaves, somewhat\r\nhairy, and divided into three parts, many bushing together at a joint,\r\nsome growing scatteringly upon the stalks, smelling somewhat strong,\r\nlike unto rozin: The flowers are small, and of a pale yellow colour,\r\ngrowing from the joint of the stalk all along among the leaves;\r\nafter which come small and round husks. The root is small and woody,\r\nperishing every year.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows more plentifully in Kent than any other county of\r\nthis land, as namely, in many places on this side Dartford, along to\r\nSouthfleet, Chatham, and Rochester, and upon Chatham down, hard by the\r\nBeacon, and half a mile from Rochester, in a field near a house called\r\nSelesys.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers and gives seed in the Summer months.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Mars owns the herb. The decoction of Ground\r\nPine drank, doth wonderfully prevail against the stranguary, or any\r\ninward pains arising from the diseases of the reins and urine, and\r\nis especially good for all obstructions of the liver and spleen, and\r\ngently opens the body; for which purpose they were wont in former\r\ntimes to make pills with the powder thereof, and the pulp of figs.\r\nIt marvellously helps all the diseases of the mother, inwardly or\r\noutwardly applied, procuring women’s courses, and expelling the dead\r\nchild and after-birth; yea, it is so powerful upon those feminine\r\nparts, that it is utterly forbidden for women with child, for it will\r\ncause abortion or delivery before the time. The decoction of the herb\r\nin wine taken inwardly, or applied outwardly, or both, for some time\r\ntogether, is also effectual in all pains and diseases of the joints,\r\nas gouts, cramps, palsies, sciatica, and aches; for which purpose the\r\npills made with powder of Ground Pine, and of Hermodactyls with Venice\r\nTurpentine are very effectual. The pills also, continued for some\r\ntime, are special good for those that have the dropsy, jaundice, and\r\nfor griping pains of the joints, belly, or inward parts. It helps also\r\nall diseases of the brain, proceeding of cold and phlegmatic humours\r\nand distillations, as also for the falling sickness. It is a special\r\nremedy for the poison of the aconites, and other poisonous herbs, as\r\nalso against the stinging of any venomous creature. It is a good remedy\r\nfor a cold cough, especially in the beginning. For all the purposes\r\naforesaid, the herb being tunned up in new drink and drank, is almost\r\nas effectual, but far more acceptable to weak and dainty stomachs. The\r\ndistilled water of the herb hath the same effects, but more weakly. The\r\nconserve of the flowers doth the like, which Matthiolus much commends\r\nagainst the palsy. The green herb, or the decoction thereof, being\r\napplied, dissolves the hardness of women’s breasts, and all other hard\r\nswellings in any other part of the body. The green herb also applied,\r\nor the juice thereof with some honey, not only cleanses putrid,\r\nstinking, foul, and malignant ulcers and sores of all sorts, but heals\r\nand solders up the lips of green wounds in any part also. Let pregnant\r\nwomen forbear, for it works violently upon the feminine part.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PLANTAIN.\r\n\r\nTHIS grows usually in meadows and fields, and by path sides, and is so\r\nwell known, that it needs no description.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It is in its beauty about June, and the seed ripens shortly\r\nafter.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is true, Misaldus and others, yea, almost\r\nall astrology-physicians, hold this to be an herb of Mars, because\r\nit cures the diseases of the head and privities, which are under the\r\nhouses of Mars, Aries, and Scorpio: The truth is, it is under the\r\ncommand of Venus, and cures the head by antipathy to Mars, and the\r\nprivities by sympathy to Venus; neither is there hardly a martial\r\ndisease but it cures.\r\n\r\nThe juice of Plantain clarified and drank for divers days together,\r\neither of itself, or in other drink, prevails wonderfully against\r\nall torments or excoriations in the intestines or bowels, helps the\r\ndistillations of rheum from the head, and stays all manner of fluxes,\r\neven women’s courses, when they flow too abundantly. It is good to stay\r\nspitting of blood and other bleedings at the mouth, or the making of\r\nfoul and bloody water, by reason of any ulcer in the reins or bladder,\r\nand also stays the too free bleeding of wounds. It is held an especial\r\nremedy for those that are troubled with the phthisic, or consumption\r\nof the lungs, or ulcers of the lungs, or coughs that come of heat.\r\nThe decoction or powder of the roots or seeds, is much more binding\r\nfor all the purposes aforesaid than the leaves. Dioscorides saith,\r\nthat three roots boiled in wine and taken, helps the tertain agues,\r\nand for the quartan agues, (but letting the number pass as fabulous)\r\nI conceive the decoction of divers roots may be effectual. The herb\r\n(but especially the seed) is held to be profitable against the dropsy,\r\nthe falling-sickness, the yellow jaundice, and stoppings of the liver\r\nand reins. The roots of Plantain, and Pellitory of Spain, beaten into\r\npowder, and put into the hollow teeth, takes away the pains of them.\r\nThe clarified juice, or distilled water, dropped into the eyes, cools\r\nthe inflammations in them, and takes away the pin and web; and dropped\r\ninto the ears, eases the pains in them, and heals and removes the heat.\r\nThe same also with the juice of Houseleek is profitable against all\r\ninflammations and breakings out of the skin, and against burnings and\r\nscaldings by fire and water. The juice or decoction made either of\r\nitself, or other things of the like nature, is of much use and good\r\neffect for old and hollow ulcers that are hard to be cured, and for\r\ncankers and sores in the mouth or privy parts of man or woman; and\r\nhelps also the pains of the piles in the fundament. The juice mixed\r\nwith oil of roses, and the temples and forehead anointed therewith,\r\neases the pains of the head proceeding from heat, and helps lunatic and\r\nfrantic persons very much; as also the biting of serpents, or a mad\r\ndog. The same also is profitably applied to all hot gouts in the feet\r\nor hands, especially in the beginning. It is also good to be applied\r\nwhere any bone is out of joint, to hinder inflammations, swellings, and\r\npains that presently rise thereupon. The powder of the dried leaves\r\ntaken in drink, kills worms of the belly; and boiled in wine, kills\r\nworms that breed in old and foul ulcers. One part of Plantain water,\r\nand two parts of the brine of powdered beef, boiled together and\r\nclarified, is a most sure remedy to heal all spreading scabs or itch\r\nin the head and body, all manner of tetters, ringworms, the shingles,\r\nand all other running and fretting sores. Briefly, the Plantains are\r\nsingularly good wound herbs, to heal fresh or old wounds or sores,\r\neither inward or outward.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PLUMS.\r\n\r\nARE so well known that they need no description.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] All Plums are under Venus, and are like\r\nwomen, some better, and some worse. As there is great diversity of\r\nkinds, so there is in the operation of Plums, for some that are sweet\r\nmoisten the stomach, and make the belly soluble; those that are sour\r\nquench thirst more, and bind the belly; the moist and waterish do\r\nsooner corrupt in the stomach, but the firm do nourish more, and offend\r\nless. The dried fruit sold by the grocers under the names of Damask\r\nPrunes, do somewhat loosen the belly, and being stewed, are often\r\nused, both in health and sickness, to relish the mouth and stomach,\r\nto procure appetite, and a little to open the body, allay choler, and\r\ncool the stomach. Plum-tree leaves boiled in wine, are good to wash\r\nand gargle the mouth and throat, to dry the flux of rheum coming to\r\nthe palate, gums, or almonds of the ear. The gum of the tree is good\r\nto break the stone. The gum or leaves boiled in vinegar, and applied,\r\nkills tetters and ringworms. Matthiolus saith, The oil preserved out of\r\nthe kernels of the stones, as oil of almonds is made, is good against\r\nthe inflamed piles, the tumours or swellings of ulcers, hoarseness of\r\nthe voice, roughness of the tongue and throat, and likewise the pains\r\nin the ears. And that five ounces of the said oil taken with one ounce\r\nof muskadel, drives forth the stone, and helps the cholic.\r\n\r\n\r\n    POLYPODY OF THE OAK.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS is a small herb consisting of nothing but roots and\r\nleaves, bearing neither stalk, flower, nor seed, as it is thought. It\r\nhath three or four leaves rising from the root, every one single by\r\nitself, of about a hand length, are winged, consisting of many small\r\nnarrow leaves cut into the middle rib, standing on each side of the\r\nstalk, large below, and smaller up to the top, not dented nor notched\r\nat the edges at all, as the male fern hath, of sad green colour, and\r\nsmooth on the upper side, but on the other side somewhat rough by\r\nreason of some yellowish flowers set thereon. The root is smaller than\r\none’s little finger, lying aslope, or creeping along under the upper\r\ncrust of the earth, brownish on the outside and greenish within, of a\r\nsweetish harshness in taste, set with certain rough knags on each side\r\nthereof, having also much mossiness or yellow hairiness upon it, and\r\nsome fibres underneath it, whereby it is nourished.\r\n\r\nPLACE.] It grows as well upon old rotten stumps, or trunks of trees, as\r\noak, beech, hazel, willow, or any other, as in the woods under them,\r\nand upon old mud walls, as also in mossy, stony, and gravelly places\r\nnear unto wood. That which grows upon oak is accounted the best; but\r\nthe quantity thereof is scarce sufficient for the common use.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It being always green, may be gathered for use at any time.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Polypodium of the Oak, that which grows\r\nupon the earth is best; it is an herb of Saturn, to purge melancholy;\r\nif the humour be otherwise, chuse your Polypodium accordingly. Meuse\r\n(who is called the Physician’s Evangelist for the certainty of his\r\nmedicines, and the truth of his opinion) saith, That it dries up\r\nthin humours, digests thick and tough, and purges burnt choler, and\r\nespecially tough and thick phlegm, and thin phlegm also, even from the\r\njoints, and therefore good for those that are troubled with melancholy,\r\nor quartan agues, especially if it be taken in whey or honied water,\r\nor in barley-water, or the broth of a chicken with Epithymum, or with\r\nBeets and Mallows. It is good for the hardness of the spleen, and for\r\npricking or stitches in the sides, as also for the cholic: Some use\r\nto put to it some Fennel seeds, or Annis seeds, or Ginger, to correct\r\nthat loathing it brings to the stomach, which is more than needs, it\r\nbeing a safe and gentle medicine, fit for all persons, which daily\r\nexperience confirms; and an ounce of it may be given at a time in a\r\ndecoction, if there be not Sena, or some other strong purger put with\r\nit. A dram or two of the powder of the dried roots, taken fasting in\r\na cup of honied water, works gently, and for the purposes aforesaid.\r\nThe distilled water both of roots and leaves, is much commended for\r\nthe quartan ague, to be taken for many days together, as also against\r\nmelancholy, or fearful and troublesome sleeps or dreams; and with some\r\nsugar-candy dissolved therein, is good against the cough, shortness of\r\nbreath, and wheezings, and those distillations of thin rheum upon the\r\nlungs, which cause phthisicks, and oftentimes consumptions. The fresh\r\nroots beaten small, or the powder of the dried roots mixed with honey,\r\nand applied to the member that is out of joint, doth much help it; and\r\napplied also to the nose, cures the disease called Polypus, which is\r\na piece of flesh growing therein, which in time stops the passage of\r\nbreath through that nostril; and it helps those clefts or chops that\r\ncome between the fingers or toes.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE POPLAR TREE.\r\n\r\nTHERE are two sorts of Poplars, which are most familiar with us, viz.\r\nthe Black and White, both which I shall here describe unto you.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The White Poplar grows great, and reasonably high, covered\r\nwith thick, smooth, white bark, especially the branches; having long\r\nleaves cut into several divisions almost like a vine leaf, but not\r\nof so deep a green on the upper side, and hoary white underneath,\r\nof a reasonable good scent, the whole form representing the form of\r\nColtsfoot. The catkins which it brings forth before the leaves, are\r\nlong, and of a faint reddish colour, which fall away, bearing seldom\r\ngood seed with them. The wood hereof is smooth, soft, and white, very\r\nfinely waved, whereby it is much esteemed.\r\n\r\nThe Black Poplar grows higher and straighter than the White, with a\r\ngreyish bark, bearing broad green leaves, somewhat like ivy leaves, not\r\ncut in on the edges like the White, but whole and dented, ending in a\r\npoint, and not white underneath, hanging by slender long foot stalks,\r\nwhich with the air are continually shaken, like as the Aspen leaves\r\nare. The catkins hereof are greater than those of the White, composed\r\nof many round green berries, as if they were set together in a long\r\ncluster, containing much downy matter, which being ripe, is blown away\r\nwith the wind. The clammy buds hereof, before they spread into leaves,\r\nare gathered to make Unguentum and Populneum, and are of a yellowish\r\ngreen colour, and somewhat small, sweet, but strong. The wood is\r\nsmooth, tough, and white, and easy to be cloven. On both these trees\r\ngrows a sweet kind of musk, which in former times was used to put into\r\nsweet ointments.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow in moist woods, and by water-sides in sundry places\r\nof this land; yet the White is not so frequent as the other.\r\n\r\n_Time._] Their time is likewise expressed before: The catkins coming\r\nforth before the leaves in the end of Summer.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Saturn hath dominion over both. White\r\nPoplar, saith Galen, is of a cleansing property: The weight of an\r\nounce in powder, of the bark thereof, being drank, saith Dioscorides,\r\nis a remedy for those that are troubled with the sciatica, or the\r\nstranguary. The juice of the leaves dropped warm into the ears,\r\neases the pains in them. The young clammy buds or eyes, before they\r\nbreak out into leaves, bruised, and a little honey put to them, is a\r\ngood medicine for a dull sight. The Black Poplar is held to be more\r\ncooling than the White, and therefore the leaves bruised with vinegar\r\nand applied, help the gout. The seed drank in vinegar, is held good\r\nagainst the falling-sickness. The water that drops from the hollow\r\nplaces of this tree, takes away warts, pushes, wheals, and other the\r\nlike breakings-out of the body. The young Black Poplar buds, saith\r\nMatthiolus, are much used by women to beautify their hair, bruising\r\nthem with fresh butter, straining them after they have been kept for\r\nsome time in the sun. The ointment called Populneon, which is made of\r\nthis Poplar, is singularly good for all heat and inflammations in any\r\npart of the body, and tempers the heat of wounds. It is much used to\r\ndry up the milk of women’s breasts when they have weaned their children.\r\n\r\n\r\n    POPPY.\r\n\r\nOF this I shall describe three kinds, _viz._ the White and Black of\r\nthe Garden, and the Erratic Wild Poppy, or Corn Rose.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The White Poppy hath at first four or five whitish green\r\nleaves lying upon the ground, which rise with the stalk, compassing\r\nit at the bottom of them, and are very large, much cut or torn on the\r\nedges, and dented also besides: The stalk, which is usually four or\r\nfive feet high, hath sometimes no branches at the top, and usually but\r\ntwo or three at most, bearing every one but one head wrapped up in a\r\nthin skin, which bows down before it is ready to blow, and then rising,\r\nand being broken, the flowers within it spreading itself open, and\r\nconsisting of four very large, white, round leaves, with many whitish\r\nround threads in the middle, set about a small, round, green head,\r\nhaving a crown, or star-like cover at the head thereof, which growing\r\nripe, becomes as large as a great apple, wherein are contained a great\r\nnumber of small round seeds, in several partitions or divisions next\r\nunto the shell, the middle thereof remaining hollow, and empty. The\r\nwhole plant, both leaves, stalks, and heads, while they are fresh,\r\nyoung, and green, yield a milk when they are broken, of an unpleasant\r\nbitter taste, almost ready to provoke casting, and of a strong heady\r\nsmell, which being condensed, is called Opium. The root is white and\r\nwoody, perishing as soon as it hath given ripe seed.\r\n\r\nThe Black Poppy little differs from the former, until it bears its\r\nflower, which is somewhat less, and of a black purplish colour, but\r\nwithout any purple spots in the bottom of the leaf. The head of the\r\nseed is much less than the former, and opens itself a little round\r\nabout the top, under the crown, so that the seed, which is very black,\r\nwill fall out, if one turn the head thereof downward.\r\n\r\nThe wild Poppy, or Corn Rose, hath long and narrow leaves, very much\r\ncut in on the edges into many divisions, of a light green colour,\r\nsometimes hairy withal. The stalk is blackish and hairy also, but not\r\nso tall as the garden kind, having some such like leaves thereon to\r\ngrow below, parted into three or four branches sometimes, whereon grow\r\nsmall hairy heads bowing down before the skin break, wherein the flower\r\nis inclosed, which when it is fully blown open, is of a fair yellowish\r\nred or crimson colour, and in some much paler, without any spot in the\r\nbottom of the leaves, having many black soft threads in the middle,\r\ncompassing a small green head, which when it is ripe, is not bigger\r\nthan one’s little finger’s end, wherein is contained much black seeds\r\nsmaller than that of the garden. The root perishes every year, and\r\nsprings again of its own sowing. Of this kind there is one lesser in\r\nall parts thereof, and differs in nothing else.\r\n\r\n_Place._] The garden kinds do not naturally grow wild in any place, but\r\nall are sown in gardens where they grow.\r\n\r\nThe Wild Poppy or Corn Rose, is plentifully enough, and many times too\r\nmuch so in the corn fields of all counties through this land, and also\r\non ditch banks, and by hedge sides. The smaller wild kind is also found\r\nin corn fields, and also in some other places, but not so plentifully\r\nas the former.\r\n\r\n_Time._] The garden kinds are usually sown in the spring, which then\r\nflower about the end of May, and somewhat earlier, if they spring of\r\ntheir own sowing.\r\n\r\nThe wild kind flower usually from May until July, and the seed of them\r\nis ripe soon after the flowering.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The herb is Lunar, and of the juice of it\r\nis made opium; only for lucre of money they cheat you, and tell you it\r\nis a kind of tear, or some such like thing, that drops from Poppies\r\nwhen they weep, and that is somewhere beyond the seas, I know not where\r\nbeyond the Moon. The garden Poppy heads with seeds made into a syrup,\r\nis frequently, and to good effect used to procure rest, and sleep, in\r\nthe sick and weak, and to stay catarrhs and defluxions of thin rheums\r\nfrom the head into the stomach and lungs, causing a continual cough,\r\nthe fore-runner of a consumption; it helps also hoarseness of the\r\nthroat, and when one have lost their voice, which the oil of the seed\r\ndoth likewise. The black seed boiled in wine, and drank, is said also\r\nto dry the flux of the belly, and women’s courses. The empty shells,\r\nor poppy heads, are usually boiled in water, and given to procure\r\nrest and sleep: so doth the leaves in the same manner; as also if the\r\nhead and temples be bathed with the decoction warm, or with the oil\r\nof Poppies, the green leaves or the heads bruised and applied with\r\na little vinegar, or made into a poultice with barley-meal or hog’s\r\ngrease, cools and tempers all inflammations, as also the disease called\r\nSt. Anthony’s fire. It is generally used in treacle and mithridate, and\r\nin all other medicines that are made to procure rest and sleep, and to\r\nease pains in the head as well as in other parts. It is also used to\r\ncool inflammations, agues, or frenzies, or to stay defluxions which\r\ncause a cough, or consumptions, and also other fluxes of the belly or\r\nwomen’s courses; it is also put into hollow teeth, to ease the pain,\r\nand hath been found by experience to ease the pains of the gout.\r\n\r\nThe Wild Poppy, or Corn Rose (as Matthiolus saith) is good to prevent\r\nthe falling-sickness. The syrup made with the flower, is with good\r\neffect given to those that have the pleurisy; and the dried flowers\r\nalso, either boiled in water, or made into powder and drank, either\r\nin the distilled water of them, or some other drink, works the like\r\neffect. The distilled water of the flowers is held to be of much good\r\nuse against surfeits, being drank evening and morning; It is also more\r\ncooling than any of the other Poppies, and therefore cannot but be as\r\neffectual in hot agues, frenzies, and other inflammations either inward\r\nor outward. Galen saith, The seed is dangerous to be used inwardly.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PURSLAIN.\r\n\r\nGARDEN Purslain (being used as a sallad herb) is so well known that it\r\nneeds no description; I shall therefore only speak of its virtues as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] ’Tis an herb of the Moon. It is good to\r\ncool any heat in the liver, blood, reins, and stomach, and in hot\r\nagues nothing better: It stays hot and choleric fluxes of the belly,\r\nwomen’s courses, the whites, and gonorrhæa, or running of the reins,\r\nthe distillation from the head, and pains therein proceeding from heat,\r\nwant of sleep, or the frenzy. The seed is more effectual than the herb,\r\nand is of singular good use to cool the heat and sharpness of urine,\r\nvenereous dreams, and the like; insomuch that the over frequent use\r\nhereof extinguishes the heat and virtue of natural procreation. The\r\nseed bruised and boiled in wine, and given to children, expels the\r\nworms. The juice of the herb is held as effectual to all the purposes\r\naforesaid; as also to stay vomitings, and taken with some sugar or\r\nhoney, helps an old and dry cough, shortness of breath, and the\r\nphthisick, and stays immoderate thirst. The distilled water of the herb\r\nis used by many (as the more pleasing) with a little sugar to work the\r\nsame effects. The juice also is singularly good in the inflammations\r\nand ulcers in the secret parts of man or woman, as also the bowels\r\nand hæmorrhoids, when they are ulcerous, or excoriations in them. The\r\nherb bruised and applied to the forehead and temples, allays excessive\r\nheat therein, that hinders rest and sleep; and applied to the eyes,\r\ntakes away the redness and inflammation in them, and those other parts\r\nwhere pushes, wheals, pimples, St. Anthony’s fire and the like, break\r\nforth; if a little vinegar be put to it, and laid to the neck, with as\r\nmuch of galls and linseed together, it takes away the pains therein,\r\nand the crick in the neck. The juice is used with oil of roses for the\r\nsame causes, or for blasting by lightning, and burnings by gunpowder,\r\nor for women’s sore breasts, and to allay the heat in all other sores\r\nor hurts; applied also to the navels of children that stick forth, it\r\nhelps them; it is also good for sore mouths and gums that are swollen,\r\nand to fasten loose teeth. Camerarius saith, the distilled water used\r\nby some, took away the pain of their teeth, when all other remedies\r\nfailed, and the thickened juice made into pills with the powder of gum\r\nTragicanth and Arabic, being taken, prevails much to help those that\r\nmake bloody water. Applied to the gout it eases pains thereof, and\r\nhelps the hardness of the sinews, if it come not of the cramp, or a\r\ncold cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PRIMROSES.\r\n\r\nTHEY are so well known, that they need no description. Of the leaves of\r\nPrimroses is made as fine a salve to heal wounds as any that I know;\r\nyou shall be taught to make salves of any herb at the latter end of the\r\nbook: make this as you are taught there, and do not (you that have any\r\ningenuity in you) see your poor neighbours go with wounded limbs when\r\nan halfpenny cost will heal them.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PRIVET.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] OUR common Privet is carried up with many slender branches\r\nto a reasonable height and breadth, to cover arbours, bowers and\r\nbanquetting houses, and brought, wrought, and cut into so many forms,\r\nof men, horses, birds, &c. which though at first supported, grows\r\nafterwards strong of itself. It bears long and narrow green leaves by\r\nthe couples, and sweet smelling white flowers in tufts at the end of\r\nthe branches, which turn into small black berries that have a purplish\r\njuice with them, and some seeds that are flat on the one side, with a\r\nhole or dent therein.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in this land, in divers woods.\r\n\r\n_Time._] Our Privet flowers in June and July, the berries are ripe in\r\nAugust and September.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The Moon is lady of this. It is little used\r\nin physic with us in these times, more than in lotions, to wash sores\r\nand sore mouths, and to cool inflammations, and dry up fluxes. Yet\r\nMatthiolus saith, it serves all the uses for which Cypress, or the East\r\nPrivet, is appointed by Dioscorides and Galen. He further saith, That\r\nthe oil that is made of the flowers of Privet infused therein, and set\r\nin the Sun, is singularly good for the inflammations of wounds, and\r\nfor the headache, coming of a hot cause. There is a sweet water also\r\ndistilled from the flowers, that is good for all those diseases that\r\nneed cooling and drying, and therefore helps all fluxes of the belly\r\nor stomach, bloody-fluxes, and women’s courses, being either drank or\r\napplied; as all those that void blood at the mouth, or any other place,\r\nand for distillations of rheum in the eyes, especially if it be used\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\n\r\n    QUEEN OF THE MEADOWS, MEADOW\r\n    SWEET, OR MEAD SWEET.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THE stalks of these are reddish, rising to be three feet\r\nhigh, sometimes four or five feet, having at the joints thereof large\r\nwinged leaves, standing one above another at distances, consisting of\r\nmany and somewhat broad leaves, set on each side of a middle rib, being\r\nhard, rough, or rugged, crumpled much like unto elm leaves, having\r\nalso some smaller leaves with them (as Agrimony hath) somewhat deeply\r\ndented about the edges, of a sad green colour on the upper side, and\r\ngreyish underneath, of a pretty sharp scent and taste, somewhat like\r\nunto the Burnet, and a leaf hereof put into a cup of claret wine, gives\r\nalso a fine relish to it. At the tops of the stalks and branches stand\r\nmany tufts of small white flowers thrust thick together, which smell\r\nmuch sweeter than the leaves; and in their places, being fallen, come\r\ncrooked and cornered seed. The root is somewhat woody, and blackish on\r\nthe outside, and brownish within, with divers great strings, and lesser\r\nfibres set thereat, of a strong scent, but nothing so pleasant as the\r\nflowers and leaves, and perishes not, but abides many years, shooting\r\nforth a-new every Spring.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in moist meadows that lie mostly wet, or near the\r\ncourses of water.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in some places or other all the three Summer\r\nmonths, that is, June, July, and August, and the seed is ripe soon\r\nafter.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Venus claims dominion over the herb. It is\r\nused to stay all manner of bleedings, fluxes, vomitings, and women’s\r\ncourses, also their whites: It is said to alter and take away the fits\r\nof the quartan agues, and to make a merry heart, for which purpose some\r\nuse the flowers, and some the leaves. It helps speedily those that\r\nare troubled with the cholic; being boiled in wine, and with a little\r\nhoney, taken warm, it opens the belly; but boiled in red wine, and\r\ndrank, it stays the flux of the belly. Outwardly applied, it helps old\r\nulcers that are cankerous, or hollow fistulous, for which it is by many\r\nmuch commended, as also for the sores in the mouth or secret parts. The\r\nleaves when they are full grown, being laid on the skin, will, in a\r\nshort time, raise blisters thereon, as Tragus saith. The water thereof\r\nhelps the heat and inflammation in the eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE QUINCE TREE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THE ordinary Quince Tree grows often to the height and\r\nbigness of a reasonable apple tree, but more usually lower, and\r\ncrooked, with a rough bark, spreading arms, and branches far abroad.\r\nThe leaves are somewhat like those of the apple tree, but thicker,\r\nbroader, and full of veins, and whiter on the under side, not dented\r\nat all about the edges. The flowers are large and white, sometimes\r\ndashed over with a blush. The fruit that follows is yellow, being near\r\nripe, and covered with a white freeze, or cotton; thick set on the\r\nyounger, and growing less as they grow to be thorough ripe, bunched out\r\noftentimes in some places, some being like an apple, and some a pear,\r\nof a strong heady scent, and not durable to keep, and is sour, harsh,\r\nand of an unpleasant taste to eat fresh; but being scalded, roasted,\r\nbaked, or preserved, becomes more pleasant.\r\n\r\n_Place and Time._] It best likes to grow near ponds and water sides,\r\nand is frequent through this land: and flowers not until the leaves be\r\ncome forth. The fruit is ripe in September or October.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Old Saturn owns the Tree. Quinces when they\r\nare green, help all sorts of fluxes in men or women, and choleric\r\nlasks, casting, and whatever needs astriction, more than any way\r\nprepared by fire; yet the syrup of the juice, or the conserve, are much\r\nconducible, much of the binding quality being consumed by the fire;\r\nif a little vinegar be added, it stirs up the languishing appetite,\r\nand the stomach given to casting; some spices being added, comforts\r\nand strengthens the decaying and fainting spirits, and helps the liver\r\noppressed, that it cannot perfect the digestion, or corrects choler and\r\nphlegm. If you would have them purging, put honey to them instead of\r\nsugar; and if more laxative, for choler, Rhubarb; for phlegm, Turbith;\r\nfor watery humours, Scammony; but if more forcible to bind, use the\r\nunripe Quinces, with roses and acacia, hypocistis, and some torrified\r\nrhubarb. To take the crude juice of Quinces, is held a preservative\r\nagainst the force of deadly poison; for it hath been found most\r\ncertainly true, that the very smell of a Quince hath taken away all\r\nthe strength of the poison of white Hellebore. If there be need of any\r\noutwardly binding and cooling of hot fluxes, the oil of Quinces, or\r\nother medicines that may be made thereof, are very available to anoint\r\nthe belly or other parts therewith; it likewise strengthens the stomach\r\nand belly, and the sinews that are loosened by sharp humours falling on\r\nthem, and restrains immoderate sweatings. The muscilage taken from the\r\nseeds of Quinces, and boiled in a little water, is very good to cool\r\nthe heat and heal the sore breasts of women. The same, with a little\r\nsugar, is good to lenify the harshness and hoarseness of the throat,\r\nand roughness of the tongue. The cotton or down of Quinces boiled and\r\napplied to plague sores, heals them up: and laid as a plaister, made\r\nup with wax, it brings hair to them that are bald, and keeps it from\r\nfalling, if it be ready to shed.\r\n\r\n\r\n    RADDISH, OR HORSE-RADDISH.\r\n\r\nTHE garden Raddish is so well known, that it needs no description.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The Horse-Raddish hath its first leaves, that rise before\r\nWinter, about a foot and a half long, very much cut in or torn on the\r\nedges into many parts, of a dark green colour, with a great rib in the\r\nmiddle; after these have been up a while, others follow, which are\r\ngreater, rougher, broader and longer, whole and not divided at first,\r\nbut only somewhat rougher dented about the edges; the stalks when it\r\nbears flowers (which is seldom) is great, rising up with some few\r\nlesser leaves thereon, to three or four feet high, spreading at the top\r\nmany small branches of whitish flowers, made of four leaves a-piece;\r\nafter which come small pods, like those of Shepherd’s Purse, but seldom\r\nwith any seed in them. The root is great, long, white and rugged,\r\nshooting up divers heads of leaves, which may be parted for increase,\r\nbut it doth not creep in the ground, nor run above ground, and is of a\r\nstrong, sharp, and bitter taste almost like mustard.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It is found wild in some places, but is chiefly planted in\r\ngardens, and joys in moist and shadowy places.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It seldom flowers, but when it doth, it is in July.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] They are both under Mars. The juice of\r\nHorse-raddish given to drink, is held to be very effectual for the\r\nscurvy. It kills the worms in children, being drank, and also laid upon\r\nthe belly. The root bruised and laid to the place grieved with the\r\nsciatica, joint-ache, or the hard swellings of the liver and spleen,\r\ndoth wonderfully help them all. The distilled water of the herb and\r\nroot is more familiar to be taken with a little sugar for all the\r\npurposes aforesaid.\r\n\r\nGarden Raddishes are in wantonness by the gentry eaten as a sallad, but\r\nthey breed but scurvy humours in the stomach, and corrupt the blood,\r\nand then send for a physician as fast as you can; this is one cause\r\nwhich makes the owners of such nice palates so unhealthful; yet for\r\nsuch as are troubled with the gravel, stone, or stoppage of urine, they\r\nare good physic, if the body be strong that takes them; you may make\r\nthe juice of the roots into a syrup if you please, for that use: they\r\npurge by urine exceedingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n    RAGWORT.\r\n\r\nIT is called also St. James’-wort, and Stagger-wort, and Stammer-wort,\r\nand Segrum.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The greater common Ragwort hath many large and long, dark\r\ngreen leaves lying on the ground, very much rent and torn on the\r\nsides in many places: from among which rise up sometimes but one, and\r\nsometimes two or three square or crested blackish or brownish stalks,\r\nthree or four feet high, sometimes branched, bearing divers such-like\r\nleaves upon them, at several distances upon the top, where it branches\r\nforth into many stalks bearing yellow flowers, consisting of divers\r\nleaves, set as a pale or border, with a dark yellow thrum in the\r\nmiddle, which do abide a great while, but at last are turned into down,\r\nand with the small blackish grey seed, are carried away with the wind.\r\nThe root is made of many fibres, whereby it is firmly fastened into the\r\nground, and abides many years.\r\n\r\nThere is another sort thereof differs from the former only in this,\r\nthat it rises not so high; the leaves are not so finely jagged, nor of\r\nso dark a green colour, but rather somewhat whitish, soft and woolly,\r\nand the flowers usually paler.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow, both of them, wild in pastures, and untilled\r\ngrounds in many places, and oftentimes both in one field.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in June and July, and the seed is ripe in August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Ragwort is under the command of Dame Venus,\r\nand cleanses, digests, and discusses. The decoction of the herb is good\r\nto wash the mouth or throat that hath ulcers or sores therein: and for\r\nswellings, hardness, or imposthumes, for it thoroughly cleanses and\r\nheals them; as also the quinsy, and the king’s evil. It helps to stay\r\ncatarrhs, thin rheums, and defluxions from the head into the eyes,\r\nnose, or lungs. The juice is found by experience to be singularly good\r\nto heal green wounds, and to cleanse and heal all old and filthy ulcers\r\nin the privities, and in other parts of the body, as also inward wounds\r\nand ulcers; stays the malignity of fretting and running cankers, and\r\nhollow fistulas, not suffering them to spread farther. It is also\r\nmuch commended to help aches and pains either in the fleshy part, or\r\nin the nerves and sinews, as also the sciatica, or pain of the hips or\r\nknuckle-bone, to bathe the places with the decoction of the herb, or\r\nto anoint them with an ointment made of the herb bruised and boiled in\r\nold hog’s suet, with some Mastick and Olibanum in powder added unto it\r\nafter it is strained forth. In Sussex we call it Ragweed.\r\n\r\n\r\n    RATTLE GRASS.\r\n\r\nOF this there are two kinds which I shall speak of, _viz._ the red and\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The common Red Rattle hath sundry reddish, hollow stalks,\r\nand sometimes green, rising from the root, lying for the most part\r\non the ground, some growing more upright, with many small reddish or\r\ngreen leaves set on both sides of a middle rib, finely dented about the\r\nedges: The flowers stand at the tops of the stalks and branches, of a\r\nfine purplish red colour, like small gaping hooks; after which come\r\nblackish seed in small husks, which lying loose therein, will rattle\r\nwith shaking. The root consists of two or three small whitish strings\r\nwith some fibres thereat.\r\n\r\nThe common Yellow Rattle hath seldom above one round great stalk,\r\nrising from the foot, about half a yard, or two feet high, and but few\r\nbranches thereon, having two long and somewhat broad leaves set at\r\na joint, deeply cut in on the edges, resembling the comb of a cock,\r\nbroadest next to the stalk, and smaller to the end. The flowers grow\r\nat the tops of the stalks, with some shorter leaves with them, hooded\r\nafter the same manner that the others are, but of a fair yellow colour,\r\nor in some paler, and in some more white. The seed is contained in\r\nlarge husks, and being ripe, will rattle or make a noise with lying\r\nloose in them. The root is small and slender, perishing every year.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow in meadows and woods generally through this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They are in flower from Midsummer until August be past,\r\nsometimes.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] They are both of them under the dominion of\r\nthe Moon. The Red Rattle is accounted profitable to heal up fistulas\r\nand hollow ulcers, and to stay the flux of humours in them, as also\r\nthe abundance of women’s courses, or any other fluxes of blood, being\r\nboiled in red wine, and drank.\r\n\r\nThe yellow Rattle, or Cock’s Comb, is held to be good for those that\r\nare troubled with a cough, or dimness of sight, if the herb, being\r\nboiled with beans, and some honey put thereto, be drank or dropped into\r\nthe eyes. The whole seed being put into the eyes, draws forth any skin,\r\ndimness or film, from the sight, without trouble, or pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n    REST HARROW, OR CAMMOCK.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] COMMON Rest Harrow rises up with divers rough woody twigs\r\nhalf a yard or a yard high, set at the joints without order, with\r\nlittle roundish leaves, sometimes more than two or three at a place,\r\nof a dark green colour, without thorns while they are young; but\r\nafterwards armed in sundry places, with short and sharp thorns. The\r\nflowers come forth at the tops of the twigs and branches, whereof it\r\nis full fashioned like pease or broom blossoms, but lesser, flatter,\r\nand somewhat closer, of a faint purplish colour; after which come small\r\npods containing small, flat, round seed: The root is blackish on the\r\noutside, and whitish within, very rough, and hard to break when it is\r\nfresh and green, and as hard as an horn when it is dried, thrusting\r\ndown deep into the ground, and spreading likewise, every piece being\r\napt to grow again if it be left in the ground.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in many places of this land, as well in the arable\r\nas waste ground.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers about the beginning or middle of July, and the seed\r\nis ripe in August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of Mars. It is\r\nsingularly good to provoke urine when it is stopped, and to break and\r\ndrive forth the stone, which the powder of the bark of the root taken\r\nin wine performs effectually. Matthiolus saith, The same helps the\r\ndisease called _Herma Carnosa_, the fleshy rupture, by taking the said\r\npowder for three months together constantly, and that it hath cured\r\nsome which seemed incurable by any other means than by cutting or\r\nburning. The decoction thereof made with some vinegar, gargled in the\r\nmouth, eases the tooth-ache, especially when it comes of rheum; and the\r\nsaid decoction is very powerful to open obstructions of the liver and\r\nspleen, and other parts. A distilled water in _Balneo Mariæ_, with four\r\npounds of the root hereof first sliced small, and afterwards steeped\r\nin a gallon of Canary wine, is singularly good for all the purposes\r\naforesaid, and to cleanse the urinary passages. The powder of the said\r\nroot made into an electuary, or lozenges, with sugar, as also the bark\r\nof the fresh roots boiled tender, and afterwards beaten to a conserve\r\nwith sugar, works the like effect. The powder of the roots strewed upon\r\nthe brims of ulcers, or mixed with any other convenient thing, and\r\napplied, consumes the hardness, and causes them to heal the better.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ROCKET.\r\n\r\nIN regard the Garden Rocket is rather used as a sallad herb than to any\r\nphysical purposes, I shall omit it, and only speak of the common wild\r\nRocket. The description whereof take as follows.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The common wild Rocket has longer and narrower leaves,\r\nmuch more divided into slender cuts and jags on both sides the middle\r\nrib than the garden kinds have; of a sad green colour, from among\r\nwhich rise up divers stalks two or three feet high, sometimes set with\r\nthe like leaves, but smaller and smaller upwards, branched from the\r\nmiddle into divers stiff stalks, bearing sundry yellow flowers on them,\r\nmade of four leaves a-piece, as the others are, which afterwards yield\r\nthem small reddish seed, in small long pods, of a more bitter and hot\r\nbiting taste than the garden kinds, as the leaves are also.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It is found wild in divers places of this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers about June or July, and the seed is ripe in August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The wild Rockets are forbidden to be used\r\nalone, in regard their sharpness fumes into the head, causing aches\r\nand pains therein, and are less hurtful to hot and choleric persons,\r\nfor fear of inflaming their blood, and therefore for such we may say\r\na little doth but a little harm, for angry Mars rules them, and he\r\nsometimes will be restive when he meets with fools. The wild Rocket is\r\nmore strong and effectual to increase sperm and venerous qualities,\r\nwhereunto all the seed is more effectual than the garden kind. It\r\nserves also to help digestion, and provokes urine exceedingly. The seed\r\nis used to cure the biting of serpents, the scorpion, and the shrew\r\nmouse, and other poisons, and expels worms, and other noisome creatures\r\nthat breed in the belly. The herb boiled or stewed, and some sugar put\r\nthereto, helps the cough in children, being taken often. The seed also\r\ntaken in drink, takes away the ill scent of the arm-pits, increases\r\nmilk in nurses, and wastes the spleen. The seed mixed with honey,\r\nand used on the face, cleanses the skin from morphew, and used with\r\nvinegar, takes away freckles and redness in the face, or other parts;\r\nand with the gall of an ox, it mends foul scars, black and blue spots,\r\nand the marks of the small-pox.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WINTER-ROCKET, OR CRESSES.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] WINTER-Rocket, or Winter-Cresses, hath divers somewhat\r\nlarge sad green leaves lying upon the ground, torn or cut in divers\r\nparts, somewhat like unto Rocket or turnip leaves, with smaller pieces\r\nnext the bottom, and broad at the ends, which so abide all the Winter\r\n(if it spring up in Autumn, when it is used to be eaten) from among\r\nwhich rise up divers small round stalks, full of branches, bearing many\r\nsmall yellow flowers of four leaves a-piece, after which come small\r\npods, with reddish seed in them. The root is somewhat stringy, and\r\nperishes every year after the seed is ripe.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows of its own accord in gardens and fields, by the\r\nway-sides, in divers places, and particularly in the next pasture to\r\nthe Conduit-head behind Gray’s Inn, that brings water to Mr. Lamb’s\r\nconduit in Holborn.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in May, seeds in June, and then perishes.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] This is profitable to provoke urine, to help\r\nstranguary, and expel gravel and stone. It is good for the scurvy,\r\nand found by experience to be a singularly good wound herb to cleanse\r\ninward wounds; the juice or decoction being drank, or outwardly applied\r\nto wash foul ulcers and sores, cleansing them by sharpness, and\r\nhindering or abating the dead flesh from growing therein, and healing\r\nthem by their drying quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ROSES.\r\n\r\nI HOLD it altogether needless to trouble the reader with a description\r\nof any of these, since both the garden Roses, and the Roses of the\r\nbriars are well enough known: take therefore the virtues of them as\r\nfollows; And first I shall begin with the garden kinds.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] What a pother have authors made with Roses!\r\nWhat a racket have they kept? I shall add, red Roses are under Jupiter,\r\nDamask under Venus, White under the Moon, and Provence under the King\r\nof France. The white and red Roses are cooling and drying, and yet the\r\nwhite is taken to exceed the red in both the properties, but is seldom\r\nused inwardly in any medicine: The bitterness in the Roses when they\r\nare fresh, especially the juice, purges choler, and watery humours; but\r\nbeing dried, and that heat which caused the bitterness being consumed,\r\nthey have then a binding and astringent quality: Those also that are\r\nnot full blown, do both cool and bind more than those that are full\r\nblown, and the white Rose more than the Red. The decoction of red\r\nRoses made with wine and used, is very good for the head-ache, and\r\npains in the eyes, ears, throat, and gums; as also for the fundament,\r\nthe lower part of the belly and the matrix, being bathed or put into\r\nthem. The same decoction with the Roses remaining in it, is profitably\r\napplied to the region of the heart to ease the inflammation therein;\r\nas also St. Anthony’s fire, and other diseases of the stomach. Being\r\ndried and beaten to powder, and taken in steeled wine or water, it\r\nhelps to stay women’s courses. The yellow threads in the middle of\r\nthe Roses (which are erroneously called the Rose Seed) being powdered\r\nand drank in the distilled water of Quinces, stays the overflowing of\r\nwomen’s courses, and doth wonderfully stay the defluctions of rheum\r\nupon the gums and teeth, preserving them from corruption, and fastening\r\nthem if they be loose, being washed and gargled therewith, and some\r\nvinegar of Squills added thereto. The heads with the seed being used\r\nin powder, or in a decoction, stays the lask and spitting of blood.\r\nRed Roses do strengthen the heart, the stomach and the liver, and the\r\nretentive faculty: They mitigate the pains that arise from heat,\r\nassuage inflammations, procure rest and sleep, stay both whites and\r\nreds in women, the gonorrhea, or running of the reins, and fluxes of\r\nthe belly: the juice of them doth purge and cleanse the body from\r\ncholer and phlegm. The husks of the Roses, with the beards and nails\r\nof the Roses, are binding and cooling, and the distilled water of\r\neither of them is good for the heat and redness in the eyes, and to\r\nstay and dry up the rheums and watering of them. Of the Red Roses are\r\nusually made many compositions, all serving to sundry good uses, viz.\r\nElectuary of Roses, Conserve, both moist and dry, which is more usually\r\ncalled Sugar of roses, Syrup of dry Roses, and Honey of Roses. The\r\ncordial powder called _Diarrhoden Abbatis_, and _Aromatica Rosarum_.\r\nThe distilled Water of Roses, Vinegar of Roses, Ointment, and Oil of\r\nRoses, and the Rose leaves dried, are of great use and effect. To\r\nwrite at large of every one of these, would make my book smell too\r\nbig, it being sufficient for a volume of itself, to speak fully of\r\nthem. But briefly, the Electuary is purging, whereof two or three drams\r\ntaken by itself in some convenient liquor, is a purge sufficient for\r\na weak constitution, but may be increased to six drams, according to\r\nthe strength of the patient. It purges choler without trouble, it is\r\ngood in hot fevers, and pains of the head arising from hot choleric\r\nhumours, and heat in the eyes, the jaundice also, and joint-aches\r\nproceeding of hot humours. The moist Conserve is of much use, both\r\nbinding and cordial; for until it be about two years old, it is more\r\nbinding than cordial, and after that, more cordial than binding. Some\r\nof the younger Conserve taken with mithridate mixed together, is good\r\nfor those that are troubled with distillations of rheum from the brain\r\nto the nose, and defluctions of rheum into the eyes; as also for\r\nfluxes and lasks of the belly; and being mixed with the powder of\r\nmastich, is very good for the gonorrhea, and for the looseness of the\r\nhumours in the body. The old Conserve mixed with Aromaticum Rosarum,\r\nis a very good cordial against faintings, swoonings, weakness, and\r\ntremblings of the heart, strengthens, both it and a weak stomach,\r\nhelps digestion, stays casting, and is a very good preservative in\r\nthe time of infection. The dry Conserve, which is called the Sugar of\r\nRoses, is a very good cordial to strengthen the heart and spirits; as\r\nalso to stay defluctions. The syrup of dried red Roses strengthens a\r\nstomach given to casting, cools an over-heated liver, and the blood\r\nin agues, comforts the heart, and resists putrefaction and infection,\r\nand helps to stay lasks and fluxes. Honey of Roses is much used in\r\ngargles and lotions to wash sores, either in the mouth, throat, or\r\nother parts, both to cleanse and heal them, and to stay the fluxes\r\nof humours falling upon them. It is also used in clysters both to\r\ncool and cleanse. The cordial powders, called Diarrhoden Abbatis and\r\nAromaticum Rosarum, do comfort and strengthen the heart and stomach,\r\nprocure an appetite, help digestion, stay vomiting, and are very good\r\nfor those that have slippery bowels, to strengthen them, and to dry\r\nup their moisture. Red Rose-water is well known, and of familiar use\r\non all occasions, and better than Damask Rose-water, being cooling\r\nand cordial, refreshing, quickening the weak and faint spirits, used\r\neither in meats or broths, to wash the temples, to smell at the nose,\r\nor to smell the sweet vapours thereof out of a perfuming pot, or cast\r\ninto a hot fire shovel. It is also of much good use against the redness\r\nand inflammations of the eyes to bathe them therewith, and the temples\r\nof the head; as also against pain and ache, for which purpose also\r\nVinegar of Roses is of much good use, and to procure rest and sleep,\r\nif some thereof, and Rose-water together, be used to smell unto, or\r\nthe nose and temples moistened therewith, but more usually to moisten\r\na piece of a red Rose-cake, cut for the purpose, and heated between\r\na double folded cloth, with a little beaten nutmeg, and poppy-seed\r\nstrewed on the side that must lie next to the forehead and temples,\r\nand bound so thereto all night. The ointment of Roses is much used\r\nagainst heat and inflammations in the head, to anoint the forehead\r\nand temples, and being mixt with _Unguentum Populneum_, to procure\r\nrest: it is also used for the heat of the liver, the back and reins,\r\nand to cool and heal pushes, wheals, and other red pimples rising in\r\nthe face or other parts. Oil of Roses is not only used by itself to\r\ncool any hot swellings or inflammations, and to bind and stay fluxes\r\nof humours unto sores, but is also put into ointments and plaisters\r\nthat are cooling and binding, and restraining the flux of humours. The\r\ndried leaves of the red Roses are used both inwardly and outwardly,\r\nboth cooling, binding, and cordial, for with them are made both\r\n_Aromaticum_, _Rosarum_, _Diarrhoden Abbatis_, and _Saccharum Rosarum_,\r\neach of whose properties are before declared. Rose leaves and mint,\r\nheated and applied outwardly to the stomach, stays castings, and very\r\nmuch strengthen a weak stomach; and applied as a fomentation to the\r\nregion of the liver and heart, do much cool and temper them, and also\r\nserve instead of a Rose-cake (as is said before) to quiet the over-hot\r\nspirits, and cause rest and sleep. The syrup of Damask Roses is both\r\nsimple and compound, and made with Agaric. The simple solutive syrup\r\nis a familiar, safe, gentle and easy medicine, purging choler, taken\r\nfrom one ounce to three or four, yet this is remarkable herein, that\r\nthe distilled water of this syrup should notably bind the belly. The\r\nsyrup with Agaric is more strong and effectual, for one ounce thereof\r\nby itself will open the body more than the other, and works as much on\r\nphlegm as choler. The compound syrup is more forcible in working on\r\nmelancholic humours; and available against the leprosy, itch, tetters,\r\n&c. and the French disease: Also honey of Roses solutive is made of the\r\nsame infusions that the syrup is made of, and therefore works the same\r\neffect, both opening and purging, but is oftener given to phlegmatic\r\nthan choleric persons, and is more used in clysters than in potions,\r\nas the syrup made with sugar is. The conserve and preserved leaves of\r\nthose Roses are also operative in gently opening the belly.\r\n\r\nThe simple water of Damask Roses is chiefly used for fumes to sweeten\r\nthings, as the dried leaves thereof to make sweet powders, and fill\r\nsweet bags; and little use they are put to in physic, although they\r\nhave some purging quality; the wild Roses also are few or none of them\r\nused in physic, but are generally held to come near the nature of the\r\nmanured Roses. The fruit of the wild briar, which are called Hips,\r\nbeing thoroughly ripe, and made into a conserve with sugar, besides\r\nthe pleasantness of the taste, doth gently bind the belly, and stay\r\ndefluctions from the head upon the stomach, drying up the moisture\r\nthereof, and helps digestion. The pulp of the hips dried into a hard\r\nconsistence, like to the juice of the liquorice, or so dried that\r\nit may be made into powder and taken into drink, stays speedily the\r\nwhites in women. The briar ball is often used, being made into powder\r\nand drank, to break the stone, to provoke urine when it is stopped,\r\nand to ease and help the cholic; some appoint it to be burnt, and then\r\ntaken for the same purpose. In the middle of the balls are often found\r\ncertain white worms, which being dried and made into powder, and some\r\nof it drank, is found by experience of many to kill and drive forth the\r\nworms of the belly.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ROSA SOLIS, OR SUN DEW.\r\n\r\nIT is likewise called Red-rot, and Youth-wort.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] It hath, divers small, round, hollow leaves somewhat\r\ngreenish, but full of certain red hairs, which make them seem red,\r\nevery one standing upon his own foot-stalk, reddish, hairy likewise.\r\nThe leaves are continually moist in the hottest day, yea, the hotter\r\nthe sun shines on them, the moister they are, with a sliminess that\r\nwill rope (as we say,) the small hairs always holding the moisture.\r\nAmong these leaves rise up slender stalks, reddish also, three or four\r\nfingers high, bearing divers small white knobs one above another, which\r\nare flowers; after which in the heads are contained small seeds. The\r\nroot is a few small hairs.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows usually in bogs and wet places, and sometimes in\r\nmoist woods.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in June, and the leaves are then fittest to be\r\ngathered.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The Sun rules it, and it is under the\r\nsign Cancer. Rose Solis is accounted good to help those that have a\r\nsalt rheum distilling on their lungs, which breeds a consumption,\r\nand therefore the distilled water thereof in wine is held fit and\r\nprofitable for such to drink, which water will be of a good yellow\r\ncolour. The same water is held to be good for all other diseases of the\r\nlungs, as phthisicks, wheezings, shortness of breath, or the cough;\r\nas also to heal the ulcers that happen in the lungs; and it comforts\r\nthe heart and fainting spirits. The leaves, outwardly applied to the\r\nskin will raise blisters, which has caused some to think it dangerous\r\nto be taken inwardly; but there are other things which will also draw\r\nblisters, yet nothing dangerous to be taken inwardly. There is an usual\r\ndrink made thereof with aqua vitæ and spices frequently, and without\r\nany offence or danger, but to good purpose used in qualms and passions\r\nof the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ROSEMARY.\r\n\r\nOUR garden Rosemary is so well known, that I need not describe it.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in April and May with us, sometimes again in August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The Sun claims privilege in it, and it is\r\nunder the celestial Ram. It is an herb of as great use with us in these\r\ndays as any whatsoever, not only for physical but civil purposes. The\r\nphysical use of it (being my present task) is very much used both for\r\ninward and outward diseases, for by the warming and comforting heat\r\nthereof it helps all cold diseases, both of the head, stomach, liver,\r\nand belly. The decoction thereof in wine, helps the cold distillations\r\nof rheum into the eyes, and all other cold diseases of the head and\r\nbrain, as the giddiness or swimmings therein, drowsiness or dullness\r\nof the mind and senses like a stupidness, the dumb palsy, or loss of\r\nspeech, the lethargy, and fallen-sickness, to be both drank, and the\r\ntemples bathed therewith. It helps the pains in the gums and teeth,\r\nby rheum falling into them, not by putrefaction, causing an evil\r\nsmell from them, or a stinking breath. It helps a weak memory, and\r\nquickens the senses. It is very comfortable to the stomach in all the\r\ncold griefs thereof, helps both retention of meat, and digestion,\r\nthe decoction or powder being taken in wine. It is a remedy for the\r\nwindiness in the stomach, bowels, and spleen, and expels it powerfully.\r\nIt helps those that are liver-grown, by opening the obstructions\r\nthereof. It helps dim eyes, and procures a clear sight, the flowers\r\nthereof being taken all the while it is flowering every morning\r\nfasting, with bread and salt. Both Dioscorides and Galen say, That if\r\na decoction be made thereof with water, and they that have the yellow\r\njaundice exercise their bodies directly after the taking thereof, it\r\nwill certainly cure them. The flowers and conserve made of them, are\r\nsingularly good to comfort the heart, and to expel the contagion of\r\nthe pestilence; to burn the herb in houses and chambers, corrects the\r\nair in them. Both the flowers and leaves are very profitable for women\r\nthat are troubled with the whites, if they be daily taken. The dried\r\nleaves shred small, and taken in a pipe, as tobacco is taken, helps\r\nthose that have any cough, phthisic, or consumption, by warming and\r\ndrying the thin distillations which cause those diseases. The leaves\r\nare very much used in bathings; and made into ointments or oil, are\r\nsingularly good to help cold benumbed joints, sinews, or members. The\r\nchymical oil drawn from the leaves and flowers, is a sovereign help for\r\nall the diseases aforesaid, to touch the temples and nostrils with two\r\nor three drops for all the diseases of the head and brain spoken of\r\nbefore; as also to take one drop, two, or three, as the case requires,\r\nfor the inward griefs: Yet must it be done with discretion, for it is\r\nvery quick and piercing, and therefore but a little must be taken at a\r\ntime. There is also another oil made by insolation in this manner: Take\r\nwhat quantity you will of the flowers, and put them into a strong glass\r\nclose stopped, tie a fine linen cloth over the mouth, and turn the\r\nmouth down into another strong glass, which being set in the sun, an\r\noil will distil down into the lower glass, to be preserved as precious\r\nfor divers uses, both inward and outward, as a sovereign balm to heal\r\nthe disease before-mentioned, to clear dim sights, and to take away\r\nspots, marks, and scars in the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n    RHUBARB, OR REPHONTIC.\r\n\r\nDO not start, and say, This grows you know not how far off: and then\r\nask me, How it comes to pass that I bring it among our English simples?\r\nFor though the name may speak it foreign, yet it grows with us in\r\nEngland, and that frequent enough in our gardens; and when you have\r\nthoroughly pursued its virtues, you will conclude it nothing inferior\r\nto that which is brought out of China, and by that time this hath been\r\nas much used as that hath been, the name which the other hath gotten\r\nwill be eclipsed by the fame of this; take therefore a description at\r\nlarge of it as follows:\r\n\r\n_Descript._] At the first appearing out of the ground, when the winter\r\nis past, it hath a great round brownish head, rising from the middle\r\nor sides of the root, which opens itself into sundry leaves one after\r\nanother, very much crumpled or folded together at the first, and\r\nbrownish: but afterwards it spreads itself, and becomes smooth, very\r\nlarge and almost round, every one standing on a brownish stalk of the\r\nthickness of a man’s thumb, when they are grown to their fulness, and\r\nmost of them two feet and more in length, especially when they grow in\r\nany moist or good ground; and the stalk of the leaf, from the bottom\r\nthereof to the leaf itself, being also two feet, the breadth thereof\r\nfrom edge to edge, in the broadest place, being also two feet, of a\r\nsad or dark green colour, of a fine tart or sourish taste, much more\r\npleasant than the garden or wood sorrel. From among these rise up some,\r\nbut not every year, strong thick stalks, not growing so high as the\r\nPatience, or garden Dock, with such round leaves as grow below, but\r\nsmall at every joint up to the top, and among the flowers, which are\r\nwhite, spreading forth into many branches, consisting of five or six\r\nsmall leaves a-piece, hardly to be discerned from the white threads in\r\nthe middle, and seeming to be all threads, after which come brownish\r\nthree square seeds, like unto other Docks, but larger, whereby it\r\nmay be plainly known to be a Dock. The root grows in time to be very\r\ngreat, with divers and sundry great spreading branches from it, of a\r\ndark brownish or reddish colour on the outside, having a pale yellow\r\nskin under it, which covers the inner substance or root, which rind\r\nand skin being pared away, the root appears of so fresh and lively a\r\ncolour, with fresh coloured veins running through it, that the choicest\r\nof that Rhubarb that is brought us from beyond the seas cannot excel\r\nit, which root, if it be dried carefully, and as it ought (which must\r\nbe in our country by the gentle heat of a fire, in regard the sun is\r\nnot hot enough here to do it, and every piece kept from touching one\r\nanother) will hold its colour almost as well as when it is fresh, and\r\nhas been approved of, and commended by those who have oftentimes used\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in gardens, and flowers about the beginning and\r\nmiddle of June, and the seed is ripe in July.\r\n\r\n_Time._] The roots that are to be dried and kept all the year\r\nfollowing, are not to be taken up before the stalk and leaves be\r\nquite turned red and gone, and that is not until the middle or end of\r\nOctober, and if they be taken a little before the leaves do spring, or\r\nwhen they are sprung up, the roots will not have half so good a colour\r\nin them.\r\n\r\nI have given the precedence unto this, because in virtues also it\r\nhath the pre-eminence. I come now to describe unto you that which is\r\ncalled Patience, or Monk’s Rhubarb; and the next unto that, the great\r\nround-leaved Dock, or Bastard Rhubarb, for the one of these may happily\r\nsupply in the absence of the other, being not much unlike in their\r\nvirtues, only one more powerful and efficacious than the other. And\r\nlastly, shall shew you the virtues of all the three sorts.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GARDEN-PATIENCE, OR MONK’S RHUBARB.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS is a Dock bearing the name of Rhubarb for some\r\npurging quality therein, and grows up with large tall stalks, set\r\nwith somewhat broad and long, fair, green leaves, not dented at all.\r\nThe tops of the stalks being divided into many small branches, bear\r\nreddish or purplish flowers, and three-square seed, like unto other\r\nDocks. The root is long, great and yellow, like unto the wild Docks,\r\nbut a little redder; and if it be a little dried, shews less store of\r\ndiscoloured veins than the other does when it is dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GREAT ROUND-LEAVED DOCK, OR BASTARD\r\n    RHUBARB.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS has divers large, round, thin, yellowish green leaves\r\nrising from the root, a little waved about the edges, every one\r\nstanding upon a reasonably thick and long brownish footstalk, from\r\namong which rises up a pretty big stalk, about two feet high, with\r\nsome such high leaves growing thereon, but smaller; at the top whereof\r\nstand in a long spike many small brownish flowers, which turn into a\r\nhard three square shining brown seed, like the garden Patience before\r\ndescribed. The root grows greater than that, with many branches or\r\ngreat fibres thereat, yellow on the outside, and somewhat pale; yellow\r\nwithin, with some discoloured veins like to the Rhubarb which is first\r\ndescribed, but much less than it, especially when it is dry.\r\n\r\n_Place and Time._] These also grow in gardens, and flower and seed at\r\nor near the same time that our true Rhubarb doth, viz. they flower in\r\nJune, and the seed is ripe in July.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Mars claims predominancy over all these\r\nwholesome herbs: You cry out upon him for an unfortunate, when God\r\ncreated him for your good (only he is angry with fools.) What dishonour\r\nis this, not to Mars, but to God himself. A dram of the dried root of\r\nMonk’s Rhubarb, with a scruple of Ginger made into powder, and taken\r\nfasting in a draught or mess of warm broth, purges choler and phlegm\r\ndownwards very gently and safely without danger. The seed thereof\r\ncontrary doth bind the belly, and helps to stay any sort of lasks or\r\nbloody-flux. The distilled water thereof is very profitably used to\r\nheal scabs; also foul ulcerous sores, and to allay the inflammation\r\nof them; the juice of the leaves or roots or the decoction of them in\r\nvinegar, is used as the most effectual remedy to heal scabs and running\r\nsores.\r\n\r\nThe Bastard Rhubarb hath all the properties of the Monk’s Rhubarb, but\r\nmore effectual for both inward and outward diseases. The decoction\r\nthereof without vinegar dropped into the ears, takes away the pains;\r\ngargled in the mouth, takes away the tooth ache; and being drank, heals\r\nthe jaundice. The seed thereof taken, eases the gnawing and griping\r\npains of the stomach, and takes away the loathing thereof unto meat.\r\nThe root thereof helps the ruggedness of the nails, and being boiled\r\nin wine helps the swelling of the throat, commonly called the king’s\r\nevil, as also the swellings of the kernels of the ears. It helps them\r\nthat are troubled with the stone, provokes urine, and helps the dimness\r\nof the sight. The roots of this Bastard Rhubarb are used in opening\r\nand purging diet-drinks, with other things, to open the liver, and to\r\ncleanse and cool the blood.\r\n\r\nThe properties of that which is called the English Rhubarb are the same\r\nwith the former, but much more effectual, and hath all the properties\r\nof the true Italian Rhubarbs, except the force in purging, wherein it\r\nis but of half the strength thereof, and therefore a double quantity\r\nmust be used: it likewise hath not that bitterness and astriction; in\r\nother things it works almost in an equal quantity, which are these: It\r\npurges the body of choler and phlegm, being either taken of itself,\r\nmade into powder, and drank in a draught of white wine, or steeped\r\ntherein all night, and taken fasting, or put among other purges, as\r\nshall be thought convenient, cleansing the stomach, liver, and blood,\r\nopening obstructions, and helping those griefs that come thereof, as\r\nthe jaundice, dropsy, swelling of the spleen, tertain and daily agues,\r\nand pricking pains of the sides; and also stays spitting of blood.\r\nThe powder taken with cassia dissolved, and washed Venice turpentine,\r\ncleanses the reins and strengthens them afterwards, and is very\r\neffectual to stay the gonorrhea. It is also given for the pains and\r\nswellings in the head, for those that are troubled with melancholy,\r\nand helps the sciatica, gout, and the cramp. The powder of the Rhubarb\r\ntaken with a little mummia and madder roots in some red wine, dissolves\r\nclotted blood in the body, happening by any fall or bruise, and helps\r\nburstings and broken parts, as well inward as outward. The oil likewise\r\nwherein it hath been boiled, works the like effects being anointed.\r\nIt is used to heal those ulcers that happen in the eyes or eyelids,\r\nbeing steeped and strained; as also to assuage the swellings and\r\ninflammations; and applied with honey, boiled in wine, it takes away\r\nall blue spots or marks that happen therein. Whey or white wine are the\r\nbest liquors to steep it in, and thereby it works more effectual in\r\nopening obstructions, and purging the stomach and liver. Many do use a\r\nlittle Indian Spikenard as the best corrector thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MEADOW-RUE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] MEADOW-RUE rises up with a yellow stringy root, much\r\nspreading in the ground, shooting forth new sprouts round about, with\r\nmany herby green stalks, two feet high, crested all the length of them,\r\nset with joints here and there, and many large leaves on them, above\r\nas well as below, being divided into smaller leaves, nicked or dented\r\nin the fore part of them, of a red green colour on the upper-side, and\r\npale green underneath; Toward the top of the stalk there shoots forth\r\ndivers short branches, on every one whereof stand two, three or four\r\nsmall heads, or buttons, which breaking the skin that incloses them,\r\nshoots forth a tuft of pale greenish yellow threads, which falling\r\naway, there come in their places small three-cornered cods, wherein\r\nis contained small, long and round seed. The whole plant has a strong\r\nunpleasant scent.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in many places of this land, in the borders of moist\r\nmeadows, and ditch-sides.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers about July, or the beginning of August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Dioscorides saith, That this herb bruised\r\nand applied, perfectly heals old sores, and the distilled water of\r\nthe herb and flowers doth the like. It is used by some among other\r\npot-herbs to open the body, and make it soluble; but the roots washed\r\nclean, and boiled in ale and drank, provokes to stool more than the\r\nleaves, but yet very gently. The root boiled in water, and the places\r\nof the body most troubled with vermin and lice washed therewith while\r\nit is warm, destroys them utterly. In Italy it is good against the\r\nplague, and in Saxony against the jaundice, as _Camerarius_ saith.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GARDEN-RUE.\r\n\r\nGARDEN-RUE is so well known by this name, and the name Herb of Grace,\r\nthat I shall not need to write any farther description of it, but shall\r\nshew you the virtue of it, as follows.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of the Sun, and under Leo.\r\nIt provokes urine and women’s courses, being taken either in meat\r\nor drink. The seed thereof taken in wine, is an antidote against\r\nall dangerous medicines or deadly poisons. The leaves taken either\r\nby themselves, or with figs and walnuts, is called Mithridate’s\r\ncounter-poison against the plague, and causes all venomous things\r\nto become harmless; being often taken in meat and drink, it abates\r\nvenery. A decoction thereof with some dried dill leaves and flowers,\r\neases all pains and torments, inwardly to be drank, and outwardly to\r\nbe applied warm to the place grieved. The same being drank, helps the\r\npains both of the chest and sides, as also coughs and hardness of\r\nbreathing, the inflammations of the lungs, and the tormenting pains of\r\nthe sciatica and the joints, being anointed, or laid to the places;\r\nas also the shaking fits of agues, to take a draught before the fit\r\ncomes. Being boiled or infused in oil, it is good to help the wind\r\ncholic, the hardness and windiness of the mother, and frees women from\r\nthe strangling or suffocation thereof, if the share and the parts\r\nthereabouts be anointed therewith. It kills and drives forth the worms\r\nof the belly, if it be drank after it is boiled in wine to the half,\r\nwith a little honey; it helps the gout or pains in the joints, hands,\r\nfeet or knees, applied thereunto; and with figs it helps the dropsy,\r\nbeing bathed therewith: Being bruised and put into the nostrils, it\r\nstays the bleeding thereof. It takes away wheals and pimples, if being\r\nbruised with a few myrtle leaves, it be made up with wax, and applied.\r\nIt cures the morphew, and takes away all sorts of warts, if boiled in\r\nwine with some pepper and nitre, and the place rubbed therewith, and\r\nwith almond and honey helps the dry scabs, or any tetter or ringworm.\r\nThe juice thereof warmed in a pomegranate shell or rind, and dropped\r\ninto the ears, helps the pains of them. The juice of it and fennel,\r\nwith a little honey, and the gall of a cock put thereunto, helps the\r\ndimness of the eye-sight. An ointment made of the juice thereof with\r\noil of roses, ceruse, and a little vinegar, and anointed, cures St.\r\nAnthony’s fire, and all running sores in the head: and the stinking\r\nulcers of the nose, or other parts. The antidote used by Mithridates,\r\nevery morning fasting, to secure himself from any poison or infection,\r\nwas this: Take twenty leaves of rue, a little salt, a couple of\r\nwalnuts, and a couple of figs, beaten together into a mess, with twenty\r\njuniper berries, which is the quantity appointed for every day. Another\r\nelectuary is made thus: Take of nitre, pepper, and cummin seed, of\r\neach equal parts; of the leaves of Rue clean picked, as much in weight\r\nas all the other three weighed; beat them well together, and put as\r\nmuch honey as will make it up into an electuary (but you must first\r\nsteep your cummin seed in vinegar twenty four hours, and then dry\r\nit, or rather roast it in a hot fire-shovel, or in an oven) and is a\r\nremedy for the pains or griefs in the chest or stomach, of the spleen,\r\nbelly, or sides, by wind or stitches; of the liver by obstructions;\r\nof the reins and bladder by the stopping of urine; and helps also to\r\nextenuate fat corpulent bodies. What an infamy is cast upon the ashes\r\nof Mithridates, or Methridates (as the Augustines read his name)\r\nby unworthy people. They that deserve no good report themselves,\r\nlove to give none to others, _viz._ That renowned King of Pontus\r\nfortified his body by poison against poison. (_He cast out devils by_\r\nBeelzebub, _Prince of the devils._) What a sot is he that knows not\r\nif he had accustomed his body to cold poisons, but poisons would have\r\ndispatched him? on the contrary, if not, corrosions would have done\r\nit. The whole world is at this present time beholden to him for his\r\nstudies in physic, and he that uses the quantity but of an hazel-nut\r\nof that receipt every morning, to which his name is adjoined, shall\r\nto admiration preserve his body in health, if he do but consider that\r\nRue is an herb of the Sun, and under Leo, and gather it and the rest\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n    RUPTURE-WORT.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS spreads very many thready branches round about upon\r\nthe ground, about a span long, divided into many other smaller parts\r\nfull of small joints set very thick together, whereat come forth two\r\nvery small leaves of a French yellow, green coloured branches and\r\nall, where grows forth also a number of exceedingly small yellowish\r\nflowers, scarce to be discerned from the stalks and leaves, which turn\r\ninto seeds as small as the very dust. The root is very long and small,\r\nthrusting down deep into the ground. This has neither smell nor taste\r\nat first, but afterwards has a little astringent taste, without any\r\nmanifest heat; yet a little bitter and sharp withal.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in dry, sandy, and rocky places.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It is fresh and green all the Summer.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] They say Saturn causes ruptures; if he\r\ndo, he does no more than he can cure; if you want wit, he will teach\r\nyou, though to your cost. This herb is Saturn’s own, and is a noble\r\nantivenerean. Rupture-wort hath not its name in vain: for it is found\r\nby experience to cure the rupture, not only in children but also in\r\nelder persons, if the disease be not too inveterate, by taking a dram\r\nof the powder of the dried herb every day in wine, or a decoction made\r\nand drank for certain days together. The juice or distilled water of\r\nthe green herb, taken in the same manner, helps all other fluxes either\r\nof man or woman; vomitings also, and the gonorrhea, being taken any of\r\nthe ways aforesaid. It doth also most assuredly help those that have\r\nthe stranguary, or are troubled with the stone or gravel in the reins\r\nor bladder. The same also helps stitches in the sides, griping pains\r\nof the stomach or belly, the obstructions of the liver, and cures the\r\nyellow jaundice; likewise it kills also the worms in children. Being\r\noutwardly applied, it conglutinates wounds notably, and helps much to\r\nstay defluctions of rheum from the head to the eyes, nose, and teeth,\r\nbeing bruised green and bound thereto; or the forehead, temples, or the\r\nnape of the neck behind, bathed with the decoction of the dried herb.\r\nIt also dries up the moisture of fistulous ulcers, or any other that\r\nare foul and spreading.\r\n\r\n\r\n    RUSHES.\r\n\r\nALTHOUGH there are many kinds of Rushes, yet I shall only here insist\r\nupon those which are best known, and most medicinal; as the bulrushes,\r\nand other of the soft and smooth kinds, which grow so commonly in\r\nalmost every part of this land, and are so generally noted, that I\r\nsuppose it needless to trouble you with any description of them:\r\nBriefly then take the virtues of them as follows:\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The seed of the soft Rushes, (saith\r\nDioscorides and Galen, toasted, saith Pliny) being drank in wine and\r\nwater, stays the lask and women’s courses, when they come down too\r\nabundantly: but it causes head-ache; it provokes sleep likewise,\r\nbut must be given with caution. The root boiled in water, to the\r\nconsumption of one third, helps the cough.\r\n\r\nThus you see that conveniences have their inconveniences, and virtue is\r\nseldom unaccompanied with some vices. What I have written concerning\r\nRushes, is to satisfy my countrymen’s questions: _Are our Rushes good\r\nfor nothing?_ Yes, and as good let them alone as taken. There are\r\nremedies enough without them for any disease, and therefore as the\r\nproverb is, I care not a rush for them; or rather they will do you as\r\nmuch good as if one had given you a Rush.\r\n\r\n\r\n    RYE.\r\n\r\nTHIS is so well known in all the counties of this land, and especially\r\nto the country-people, who feed much thereon, that if I did describe\r\nit, they would presently say, I might as well have spared that labour.\r\nIts virtue follows.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Rye is more digesting than wheat; the bread\r\nand the leaven thereof ripens and breaks imposthumes, boils, and other\r\nswellings: The meal of Rye put between a double cloth, and moistened\r\nwith a little vinegar, and heated in a pewter dish, set over a chafing\r\ndish of coals, and bound fast to the head while it is hot, doth much\r\nease the continual pains of the head. Matthiolus saith, that the ashes\r\nof Rye straw put into water, and steeped therein a day and a night, and\r\nthe chops of the hands or feet washed therewith, doth heal them.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SAFFRON.\r\n\r\nTHE herb needs no description, it being known generally where it grows.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows frequently at Walden in Essex, and in Cambridgeshire.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of the Sun, and under the\r\nLion, and therefore you need not demand a reason why it strengthens the\r\nheart so exceedingly. Let not above ten grains be given at one time,\r\nfor the Sun, which is the fountain of light, may dazzle the eyes, and\r\nmake them blind; a cordial being taken in an immoderate quantity, hurts\r\nthe heart instead of helping it. It quickens the brain, for the Sun is\r\nexalted in Aries, as he hath his house in Leo. It helps consumptions of\r\nthe lungs, and difficulty of breathing. It is excellent in epidemical\r\ndiseases, as pestilence, small-pox, and measles. It is a notable\r\nexpulsive medicine, and a notable remedy for the yellow jaundice. My\r\nopinion is, (but I have no author for it) that hermodactyls are nothing\r\nelse but the roots of Saffron dried; and my reason is, that the roots\r\nof all crocus, both white and yellow, purge phlegm as hermodactyls do;\r\nand if you please to dry the roots of any crocus, neither your eyes\r\nnor your taste shall distinguish them from hermodactyls.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SAGE.\r\n\r\nOUR ordinary garden Sage needs no description.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in or about July.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Jupiter claims this, and bids me tell you,\r\nit is good for the liver, and to breed blood. A decoction of the leaves\r\nand branches of Sage made and drank, saith Dioscorides, provokes urine,\r\nbrings down women’s courses, helps to expel the dead child, and causes\r\nthe hair to become black. It stays the bleeding of wounds, and cleanses\r\nfoul ulcers. Three spoonfuls of the juice of Sage taken fasting, with\r\na little honey, doth presently stay the spitting or casting of blood\r\nof them that are in a consumption. These pills are much commended;\r\nTake of spikenard, ginger, of each two drams; of the seed of Sage\r\ntoasted at the fire, eight drams; of long pepper, twelve drams; all\r\nthese being brought into powder, put thereto so much juice of Sage\r\nas may make them into a mass of pills, taking a dram of them every\r\nmorning fasting, and so likewise at night, drinking a little pure water\r\nafter them. Matthiolus saith, it is very profitable for all manner of\r\npains in the head coming of cold and rheumatic humours: as also for\r\nall pains of the joints, whether inwardly or outwardly, and therefore\r\nhelps the falling-sickness, the lethargy, such as are dull and heavy\r\nof spirit, the palsy; and is of much use in all defluctions of rheum\r\nfrom the head, and for the diseases of the chest or breast. The leaves\r\nof Sage and nettles bruised together, and laid upon the imposthume\r\nthat rises behind the ears, doth assuage it much. The juice of Sage\r\ntaken in warm water, helps a hoarseness and a cough. The leaves sodden\r\nin wine, and laid upon the place affected with the palsy, helps much,\r\nif the decoction be drank; Also Sage taken with wormwood is good for\r\nthe bloody-flux. Pliny saith, it procures women’s courses, and stays\r\nthem coming down too fast: helps the stinging and biting of serpents,\r\nand kills the worms that breed in the ear, and in sores. Sage is of\r\nexcellent use to help the memory, warming and quickening the senses;\r\nand the conserve made of the flowers is used to the same purpose, and\r\nalso for all the former recited diseases. The juice of Sage drank\r\nwith vinegar, hath been of good use in time of the plague at all\r\ntimes. Gargles likewise are made with Sage, rosemary, honey-suckles,\r\nand plantain, boiled in wine or water, with some honey or allum put\r\nthereto, to wash sore mouths and throats, cankers, or the secret parts\r\nof man or woman, as need requires. And with other hot and comfortable\r\nherbs, Sage is boiled to bathe the body and the legs in the Summer\r\ntime, especially to warm cold joints, or sinews, troubled with the\r\npalsy and cramp, and to comfort and strengthen the parts. It is much\r\ncommended against the stitch, or pains in the side coming of wind, if\r\nthe place be fomented warm with the decoction thereof in wine, and the\r\nherb also after boiling be laid warm thereunto.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WOOD-SAGE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] WOOD-SAGE rises up with square hoary stalks, two feet\r\nhigh at the least, with two leaves set at every joint, somewhat like\r\nother Sage leaves, but smaller, softer, whiter, and rounder, and a\r\nlittle dented about the edges, and smelling somewhat stronger. At the\r\ntops of the stalks and branches stand the flowers, on a slender like\r\nspike, turning themselves all one way when they blow, and are of a\r\npale and whitish colour, smaller than Sage, but hooded and gaping like\r\nunto them. The seed is blackish and round; four usually seem in a husk\r\ntogether: the root is long and stringy, with divers fibres thereat,\r\nand abides many years.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in woods, and by wood-sides; as also in divers\r\nfields and bye-lanes in the land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in June, July, and August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The herb is under Venus. The decoction of\r\nthe Wood Sage provokes urine and women’s courses: It also provokes\r\nsweat, digests humours, and discusses swellings and nodes in the\r\nflesh, and is therefore thought to be good against the French pox.\r\nThe decoction of the green herb, made with wine, is a safe and sure\r\nremedy for those who by falls, bruises, or blows, suspect some vein\r\nto be inwardly broken, to disperse and void the congealed blood, and\r\nto consolidate the veins. The drink used inwardly, and the herb used\r\noutwardly, is good for such as are inwardly or outwardly bursten, and\r\nis found to be a sure remedy for the palsy. The juice of the herb,\r\nor the powder thereof dried, is good for moist ulcers and sores in\r\nthe legs, and other parts, to dry them, and cause them to heal more\r\nspeedily. It is no less effectual also in green wounds, to be used upon\r\nany occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SOLOMON’S SEAL.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THE common Solomon’s Seal rises up with a round stalk half\r\na yard high, bowing or bending down to the ground, set with single\r\nleaves one above another, somewhat large, and like the leaves of the\r\nlily-convally, or May-lily, with an eye of bluish upon the green,\r\nwith some ribs therein, and more yellowish underneath. At the foot of\r\nevery leaf, almost from the bottom up to the top of the stalk, come\r\nforth small, long, white and hollow pendulous flowers, somewhat like\r\nthe flowers of May-lily, but ending in five long points, for the most\r\npart two together, at the end of a long foot-stalk, and sometimes but\r\none, and sometimes also two stalks, and flowers at the foot of a leaf,\r\nwhich are without any scent at all, and stand on the top of the stalk.\r\nAfter they are past, come in their places small round berries great at\r\nthe first, and blackish green, tending to blueness when they are ripe,\r\nwherein lie small, white, hard, and stony seeds. The root is of the\r\nthickness of one’s finger or thumb, white and knotted in some places, a\r\nflat round circle representing a Seal, whereof it took the name, lying\r\nalong under the upper crust of the earth, and not growing downward, but\r\nwith many fibres underneath.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It is frequent in divers places of this land; as, namely\r\nin a wood two miles from Canterbury, by Fish-Pool Hill, as also in\r\nBushy Close belonging to the parsonage of Alderbury, near Clarendon,\r\ntwo miles from Salisbury: in Cheffon wood, on Chesson Hill, between\r\nNewington and Sittingbourn in Kent, and divers other places in Essex,\r\nand other counties.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers about May: The root abides and shoots a-new every\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Saturn owns the plant, for he loves his\r\nbones well. The root of Solomon’s Seal is found by experience to be\r\navailable in wounds, hurts, and outward sores, to heal and close up the\r\nlips of those that are green, and to dry up and restrain the flux of\r\nhumours to those that are old. It is singularly good to stay vomitings\r\nand bleeding wheresoever, as also all fluxes in man or woman; also,\r\nto knit any joint, which by weakness uses to be often out of place,\r\nor will not stay in long when it is set; also to knit and join broken\r\nbones in any part of the body, the roots being bruised and applied to\r\nthe places; yea, it hath been found by experience, and the decoction\r\nof the root in wine, or the bruised root put into wine or other\r\ndrink, and after a night’s infusion, strained forth hard and drank,\r\nhath helped both man and beast, whose bones hath been broken by any\r\noccasion, which is the most assured refuge of help to people of divers\r\ncounties of the land that they can have. It is no less effectual to\r\nhelp ruptures and burstings, the decoction in wine, or the powder in\r\nbroth or drink, being inwardly taken, and outwardly applied to the\r\nplace. The same is also available for inward or outward bruises, falls\r\nor blows, both to dispel the congealed blood, and to take away both the\r\npains and the black and blue marks that abide after the hurt. The same\r\nalso, or the distilled water of the whole plant, used to the face, or\r\nother parts of the skin, cleanses it from morphew, freckles, spots, or\r\nmarks whatsoever, leaving the place fresh, fair, and lovely; for which\r\npurpose it is much used by the Italian Dames.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SAMPHIRE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] ROCK Samphire grows up with a tender green stalk about\r\nhalf a yard, or two feet high at the most, branching forth almost\r\nfrom the very bottom, and stored with sundry thick and almost round\r\n(somewhat long) leaves of a deep green colour, sometimes two together,\r\nand sometimes more on a stalk, and sappy, and of a pleasant, hot, and\r\nspicy taste. At the top of the stalks and branches stand umbels of\r\nwhite flowers, and after them come large seed, bigger than fennel seed,\r\nyet somewhat like it. The root is great, white, and long, continuing\r\nmany years, and is of an hot and spicy taste likewise.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows on the rocks that are often moistened at the least,\r\nif not overflowed with the sea water.\r\n\r\n_Time._] And it flowers and seeds in the end of July and August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of Jupiter, and was in former\r\ntimes wont to be used more than now it is; the more is the pity. It is\r\nwell known almost to every body, that ill digestions and obstructions\r\nare the cause of most of the diseases which the frail nature of man\r\nis subject to; both which might be remedied by a more frequent use of\r\nthis herb. If people would have sauce to their meat, they may take some\r\nfor profit as well as for pleasure. It is a safe herb, very pleasant\r\nboth to taste and stomach, helps digestion, and in some sort opening\r\nobstructions of the liver and spleen: provokes urine, and helps thereby\r\nto wash away the gravel and stone engendered in the kidneys or bladder.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SANICLE.\r\n\r\nTHIS herb is by many called Butter-wort.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] Ordinary Sanicle sends forth many great round leaves,\r\nstanding upon long brownish stalks, every one somewhat deeply cut or\r\ndivided into five or six parts, and some of these also cut in somewhat\r\nlike the leaf of crow’s-foot, or dove’s-foot, and finely dented about\r\nthe edges, smooth, and of a dark shining colour, and somewhat reddish\r\nabout the brims; from among which arise up small, round green stalks,\r\nwithout any joint or leaf thereon, saving at the top, where it branches\r\nforth into flowers, having a leaf divided into three or four parts at\r\nthat joint with the flowers, which are small and white, starting out of\r\nsmall round greenish yellow heads, many standing together in a tuft,\r\nin which afterwards are the seeds contained, which are small round\r\nburs, somewhat like the leaves of clevers, and stick in the same manner\r\nupon any thing that they touch. The root is composed of many blackish\r\nstrings or fibres, set together at a little long head, which abides\r\nwith green leaves all the Winter, and perishes not.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It is found in many shadowy woods, and other places of this\r\nland.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in June, and the seed is ripe shortly after.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] This is one of Venus’s herbs, to cure the\r\nwounds or mischiefs Mars inflicts upon the body of man. It heals green\r\nwounds speedily, or any ulcers, imposthumes, or bleedings inward, also\r\ntumours in any part of the body; for the decoction or powder in drink\r\ntaken, and the juice used outwardly, dissipates the humours: and there\r\nis not found any herb that can give such present help either to man\r\nor beast, when the disease falleth upon the lungs or throat, and to\r\nheal up putrid malignant ulcers in the mouth, throat, and privities,\r\nby gargling or washing with the decoction of the leaves and roots made\r\nin water, and a little honey put thereto. It helps to stay women’s\r\ncourses, and all other fluxes of blood, either by the mouth, urine, or\r\nstool, and lasks of the belly; the ulcerations of the kidneys also, and\r\nthe pains in the bowels, and gonorrhea, being boiled in wine or water,\r\nand drank. The same also is no less powerful to help any ruptures or\r\nburstings, used both inwardly and outwardly: And briefly, it is as\r\neffectual in binding, restraining, consolidating, heating, drying and\r\nhealing, as comfrey, bugle, self-heal, or any other of the vulnerary\r\nherbs whatsoever.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SARACEN’S CONFOUND, OR SARACEN’S\r\n    WOUNDWORT.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS grows sometimes, with brownish stalks, and other\r\nwhiles with green, to a man’s height, having narrow green leaves\r\nsnipped about the edges, somewhat like those of the peach-tree, or\r\nwillow leaves, but not of such a white green colour. The tops of the\r\nstalks are furnished with many yellow star-like flowers, standing in\r\ngreen heads, which when they are fallen, and the seed ripe, which\r\nis somewhat long, small and of a brown colour, wrapped in down, is\r\ntherefore carried away with the wind. The root is composed of fibres\r\nset together at a head, which perishes not in Winter, although the\r\nstalks dry away and no leaf appears in the Winter. The taste hereof is\r\nstrong and unpleasant; and so is the smell also.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in moist and wet grounds, by wood-sides, and\r\nsometimes in moist places of shadowy groves, as also by the water side.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in July, and the seed is soon ripe, and carried\r\naway with the wind.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Saturn owns the herb, and it is of a sober\r\ncondition, like him. Among the Germans, this wound herb is preferred\r\nbefore all others of the same quality. Being boiled in wine, and drank,\r\nit helps the indisposition of the liver, and freeth the gall from\r\nobstructions; whereby it is good for the yellow jaundice and for the\r\ndropsy in the beginning of it; for all inward ulcers of the reins,\r\nmouth or throat, and inward wounds and bruises, likewise for such sores\r\nas happen in the privy parts of men and women; being steeped in wine,\r\nand then distilled, the water thereof drank, is singularly good to\r\nease all gnawings in the stomach, or other pains of the body, as also\r\nthe pains of the mother: and being boiled in water, it helps continual\r\nagues; and the said water, or the simple water of the herb distilled,\r\nor the juice or decoction, are very effectual to heal any green wound,\r\nor old sore or ulcer whatsoever, cleansing them from corruption, and\r\nquickly healing them up: Briefly, whatsoever hath been said of bugle or\r\nsanicle, may be found herein.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SAUCE-ALONE, OR JACK-BY-THE-HEDGE-SIDE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THE lower leaves of this are rounder than those that grow\r\ntowards the top of the stalks, and are set singly on a joint being\r\nsomewhat round and broad, pointed at the ends, dented also about the\r\nedges, somewhat resembling nettle leaves for the form, but of a fresher\r\ngreen colour, not rough or pricking: The flowers are white, growing\r\nat the top of the stalks one above another, which being past, follow\r\nsmall round pods, wherein are contained round seed somewhat blackish.\r\nThe root stringy and thready, perishes every year after it hath given\r\nseed, and raises itself again of its own sowing. The plant, or any part\r\nthereof, being bruised, smells of garlic, but more pleasantly, and\r\ntastes somewhat hot and sharp, almost like unto rocket.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows under walls, and by hedge-sides, and path-ways in\r\nfields in many places.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in June, July, and August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of Mercury. This is eaten by\r\nmany country people as sauce to their salt fish, and helps well to\r\ndigest the crudities and other corrupt humours engendered thereby. It\r\nwarms also the stomach, and causes digestion. The juice thereof boiled\r\nwith honey is accounted to be as good as hedge mustard for the cough,\r\nto cut and expectorate the tough phlegm. The seed bruised and boiled\r\nin wine, is a singularly good remedy for the wind colic, or the stone,\r\nbeing drank warm: It is also given to women troubled with the mother,\r\nboth to drink, and the seed put into a cloth, and applied while it is\r\nwarm, is of singularly good use. The leaves also, or the seed boiled,\r\nis good to be used in clysters to ease the pains of the stone. The\r\ngreen leaves are held to be good to heal the ulcers in the legs.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WINTER AND SUMMER SAVOURY.\r\n\r\nBOTH these are so well known (being entertained as constant inhabitants\r\nin our gardens) that they need no description.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Mercury claims dominion over this herb,\r\nneither is there a better remedy against the colic and iliac passion,\r\nthan this herb; keep it dry by you all the year, if you love yourself\r\nand your ease, and it is a hundred pounds to a penny if you do not;\r\nkeep it dry, make conserves and syrups of it for your use, and withal,\r\ntake notice that the Summer kind is the best. They are both of them\r\nhot and dry, especially the Summer kind, which is both sharp and quick\r\nin taste, expelling wind in the stomach and bowels, and is a present\r\nhelp for the rising of the mother procured by wind; provokes urine and\r\nwomen’s courses, and is much commended for women with child to take\r\ninwardly, and to smell often unto. It cures tough phlegm in the chest\r\nand lungs, and helps to expectorate it the more easily; quickens the\r\ndull spirits in the lethargy, the juice thereof being snuffed up into\r\nthe nostrils. The juice dropped into the eyes, clears a dull sight, if\r\nit proceed of thin cold humours distilled from the brain. The juice\r\nheated with the oil of Roses, and dropped into the ears, eases them\r\nof the noise and singing in them, and of deafness also. Outwardly\r\napplied with wheat flour, in manner of a poultice, it gives ease to\r\nthe sciatica and palsied members, heating and warming them, and takes\r\naway their pains. It also takes away the pain that comes by stinging of\r\nbees, wasps, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SAVINE.\r\n\r\nTO describe a plant so well known is needless, it being nursed up\r\nalmost in every garden, and abides green all the Winter.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of Mars, being hot\r\nand dry in the third degree, and being of exceeding clean parts, is of\r\na very digesting quality. If you dry the herb into powder, and mix it\r\nwith honey, it is an excellent remedy to cleanse old filthy ulcers and\r\nfistulas; but it hinders them from healing. The same is excellently\r\ngood to break carbuncles and plague-sores; also helps the king’s evil,\r\nbeing applied to the place. Being spread over a piece of leather, and\r\napplied to the navel, kills the worms in the belly, helps scabs and\r\nitch, running sores, cankers, tetters, and ringworms; and being applied\r\nto the place, may haply cure venereal sores. This I thought good to\r\nspeak of, as it may be safely used outwardly, for inwardly it cannot be\r\ntaken without manifest danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE COMMON WHITE SAXIFRAGE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS hath a few small reddish kernels of roots covered\r\nwith some skins, lying among divers small blackish fibres, which\r\nsend forth divers round, faint or yellow green leaves, and greyish\r\nunderneath, lying above the grounds, unevenly dented about the edges,\r\nand somewhat hairy, every one upon a little foot-stalk, from whence\r\nrises up round, brownish, hairy, green stalks, two or three feet\r\nhigh, with a few such like round leaves as grow below, but smaller,\r\nand somewhat branched at the top, whereon stand pretty large white\r\nflowers of five leaves a-piece, with some yellow threads in the middle,\r\nstanding in a long crested, brownish green husk. After the flowers are\r\npast, there arises sometimes a round hard head, forked at the top,\r\nwherein is contained small black seed, but usually they fall away\r\nwithout any seed, and it is the kernels or grains of the root which are\r\nusually called the White Saxifrage-seed, and so used.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in many places of our land, as well in the\r\nlower-most, as in the upper dry corners of meadows, and grassy sandy\r\nplaces. It used to grow near Lamb’s conduit, on the backside of Gray’s\r\nInn.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in May, and then gathered, as well for that which\r\nis called the seed, as to distil, for it quickly perishes down to the\r\nground when any hot weather comes.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is very effectual to cleanse the reins\r\nand bladder, and to dissolve the stone engendered in them, and to\r\nexpel it and the gravel by urine; to help the stranguary; for which\r\npurpose the decoction of the herb or roots in white wine, is most\r\nusual, or the powder of the small kernelly root, which is called the\r\nseed, taken in white wine, or in the same decoction made with white\r\nwine, is most usual. The distilled water of the whole herb, root\r\nand flowers, is most familiar to be taken. It provokes also women’s\r\ncourses, and frees and cleanses the stomach and lungs from thick and\r\ntough phlegm that trouble them. There are not many better medicines to\r\nbreak the stone than this.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BURNET SAXIFRAGE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THE greater sort of our English Burnet Saxifrage grows\r\nup with divers long stalks of winged leaves, set directly opposite\r\none to another on both sides, each being somewhat broad, and a little\r\npointed and dented about the edges, of a sad green colour. At the top\r\nof the stalks stand umbels of white flowers, after which come small and\r\nblackish seed. The root is long and whitish, abiding long. Our lesser\r\nBurnet Saxifrage hath much finer leaves than the former, and very\r\nsmall, and set one against another, deeply jagged about the edges, and\r\nof the same colour as the former. The umbels of the flowers are white,\r\nand the seed very small, and so is the root, being also somewhat hot\r\nand quick in taste.\r\n\r\n_Place._] These grow in moist meadows of this land, and are easy to be\r\nfound being well sought for among the grass, wherein many times they\r\nlay hid scarcely to be discerned.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower about July, and their seed is ripe in August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] They are both of them herbs of the Moon.\r\nThe Saxifrages are hot as pepper; and Tragus saith, by his experience,\r\nthat they are wholesome. They have the same properties the parsleys\r\nhave, but in provoking urine, and causing the pains thereof, and of\r\nthe wind and colic, are much more effectual, the roots or seed being\r\nused either in powder, or in decoctions, or any other way; and likewise\r\nhelps the windy pains of the mother, and to procure their courses, and\r\nto break and void the stone in the kidneys, to digest cold, viscous,\r\nand tough phlegm in the stomach, and is an especial remedy against all\r\nkind of venom. Castoreum being boiled in the distilled water thereof,\r\nis singularly good to be given to those that are troubled with cramps\r\nand convulsions. Some do use to make the seeds into comfits (as they do\r\ncarraway seeds) which is effectual to all the purposes aforesaid. The\r\njuice of the herb dropped into the most grievous wounds of the head,\r\ndries up their moisture, and heals them quickly. Some women use the\r\ndistilled water to take away freckles or spots in the skin or face; and\r\nto drink the same sweetened with sugar for all the purposes aforesaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SCABIOUS, THREE SORTS.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] COMMON field Scabious grows up with many hairy, soft,\r\nwhitish green leaves, some whereof are very little, if at all jagged\r\non the edges, others very much rent and torn on the sides, and have\r\nthreads in them, which upon breaking may be plainly seen; from among\r\nwhich rise up divers hairy green stalks, three or four feet high,\r\nwith such like hairy green leaves on them, but more deeply and finely\r\ndivided and branched forth a little: At the tops thereof, which\r\nare naked and bare of leaves for a good space, stand round heads\r\nof flowers, of a pale blueish colour, set together in a head, the\r\noutermost whereof are larger than the inward, with many threads also\r\nin the middle, somewhat flat at the top, as the head with the seed is\r\nlikewise; the root is great, white and thick, growing down deep into\r\nthe ground, and abides many years.\r\n\r\nThere is another sort of Field Scabious different in nothing from the\r\nformer, but only it is smaller in all respects.\r\n\r\nThe Corn Scabious differs little from the first, but that it is greater\r\nin all respects, and the flowers more inclining to purple, and the root\r\ncreeps under the upper crust of the earth, and runs not deep into the\r\nground as the first doth.\r\n\r\n_Place._] The first grows more usually in meadows, especially about\r\nLondon every where.\r\n\r\nThe second in some of the dry fields about this city, but not so\r\nplentifully as the former.\r\n\r\nThe third in standing corn, or fallow fields, and the borders of such\r\nlike fields.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in June and July, and some abide flowering until\r\nit be late in August, and the seed is ripe in the mean time.\r\n\r\nThere are many other sorts of Scabious, but I take these which I have\r\nhere described to be most familiar with us. The virtues of both these\r\nand the rest, being much alike, take them as follow.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Mercury owns the plant. Scabious is very\r\neffectual for all sorts of coughs, shortness of breath, and all other\r\ndiseases of the breast and lungs, ripening and digesting cold phlegm,\r\nand other tough humours, voids them forth by coughing and spitting: It\r\nripens also all sorts of inward ulcers and imposthumes; pleurisy also,\r\nif the decoction of the herb dry or green be made in wine, and drank\r\nfor some time together. Four ounces of the clarified juice of Scabious\r\ntaken in the morning fasting, with a dram of mithridate, or Venice\r\ntreacle, frees the heart from any infection of pestilence, if after the\r\ntaking of it the party sweat two hours in bed, and this medicine be\r\nagain and again repeated, if need require. The green herb bruised and\r\napplied to any carbuncle or plague sore, is found by certain experience\r\nto dissolve and break it in three hours space. The same decoction also\r\ndrank, helps the pains and stitches in the side. The decoction of the\r\nroots taken for forty days together, or a dram of the powder of them\r\ntaken at a time in whey, doth (as Matthiolus saith) wonderfully help\r\nthose that are troubled with running of spreading scabs, tetters,\r\nringworms, yea, although they proceed from the French pox, which, he\r\nsaith he hath tried by experience. The juice or decoction drank, helps\r\nalso scabs and breakings-out of the itch, and the like. The juice also\r\nmade up into an ointment and used, is effectual for the same purpose.\r\nThe same also heals all inward wounds by the drying, cleansing, and\r\nhealing quality therein: And a syrup made of the juice and sugar, is\r\nvery effectual to all the purposes aforesaid, and so is the distilled\r\nwater of the herb and flowers made in due season, especially to be\r\nused when the green herb is not in force to be taken. The decoction of\r\nthe herb and roots outwardly applied, doth wonderfully help all sorts\r\nof hard or cold swellings in any part of the body, is effectual for\r\nshrunk sinews or veins, and heals green wounds, old sores, and ulcers.\r\nThe juice of Scabious, made up with the powder of Borax and Samphire,\r\ncleanses the skin of the face, or other parts of the body, not only\r\nfrom freckles and pimples, but also from morphew and leprosy; the head\r\nwashed with the decoction, cleanses it from dandriff, scurf, sores,\r\nitch, and the like, used warm. The herb bruised and applied, doth in\r\na short time loosen, and draw forth any splinter, broken bone, arrow\r\nhead, or other such like thing lying in the flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SCURVYGRASS.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THE ordinary English Scurvygrass hath many thick flat\r\nleaves, more long than broad, and sometimes longer and narrower;\r\nsometimes also smooth on the edges, and sometimes a little waved;\r\nsometimes plain, smooth and pointed, of a sad green, and sometimes a\r\nblueish colour, every one standing by itself upon a long foot-stalk,\r\nwhich is brownish or greenish also, from among which arise many slender\r\nstalks, bearing few leaves thereon like the other, but longer and less\r\nfor the most part: At the tops whereof grow many whitish flowers,\r\nwith yellow threads in the middle, standing about a green head, which\r\nbecomes the seed vessel, which will be somewhat flat when it is ripe,\r\nwherein is contained reddish seed, tasting somewhat hot. The root is\r\nmade of many white strings, which stick deeply into the mud, wherein it\r\nchiefly delights, yet it will well abide in the more upland and drier\r\nground, and tastes a little brackish and salt even there, but not so\r\nmuch as where it hath the salt water to feed upon.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows all along the Thames sides, both on the Essex and\r\nKentish shores, from Woolwich round about the sea coasts to Dover,\r\nPortsmouth, and even to Bristol, where it is had in plenty; the other\r\nwith round leaves grows in the marshes in Holland, in Lincolnshire, and\r\nother places of Lincolnshire by the sea side.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] There is also another sort called Dutch Scurvygrass, which\r\nis most known, and frequent in gardens, which has fresh, green, and\r\nalmost round leaves rising from the root, not so thick as the former,\r\nyet in some rich ground, very large, even twice as big as in others,\r\nnot dented about the edges, or hollow in the middle, standing on a long\r\nfoot-stalk; from among these rise long, slender stalks, higher than\r\nthe former, with more white flowers at the tops of them, which turn\r\ninto small pods, and smaller brownish seed than the former. The root is\r\nwhite, small and thready. The taste is nothing salt at all; it hath a\r\nhot, aromatical spicy taste.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in April and May, and gives seed ripe quickly after.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of Jupiter. The English Scurvy\r\ngrass is more used for the salt taste it bears, which doth somewhat\r\nopen and cleanse; but the Dutch Scurvygrass is of better effect, and\r\nchiefly used (if it may be had) by those that have the scurvy, and\r\nis of singular good effect to cleanse the blood, liver, and spleen,\r\ntaking the juice in the Spring every morning fasting in a cup of drink.\r\nThe decoction is good for the same purpose, and opens obstructions,\r\nevacuating cold, clammy and phlegmatic humours both from the liver and\r\nthe spleen, and bringing the body to a more lively colour. The juice\r\nalso helps all foul ulcers and sores in the mouth, gargled therewith;\r\nand used outwardly, cleanses the skin from spots, marks, or scars that\r\nhappen therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SELF-HEAL.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THE common Self-heal which is called also Prunel,\r\nCarpenter’s Herb, Hook-heal, and Sickle-wort, is a small, low, creeping\r\nherb, having many small, roundish pointed leaves, like leaves of wild\r\nmints, of a dark green colour, without dents on the edges; from among\r\nwhich rise square hairy stalks, scarce a foot high, which spread\r\nsometimes into branches with small leaves set thereon, up to the top,\r\nwhere stand brown spiked heads of small brownish leaves like scales and\r\nflowers set together, almost like the heads of Cassidony, which flowers\r\nare gaping, and of a blueish purple, or more pale blue, in some places\r\nsweet, but not so in others. The root consists of many fibres downward,\r\nand spreading strings also whereby it increases. The small stalks, with\r\nthe leaves creeping on the ground, shoot forth fibres taking hold on\r\nthe ground, whereby it is made a great tuft in a short time.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It is found in woods and fields every where.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in May, and sometimes in April.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Here is another herb of Venus, Self-heal,\r\nwhereby when you are hurt you may heal yourself: It is a special herb\r\nfor inward and outward wounds. Take it inwardly in syrups for inward\r\nwounds: outwardly in unguents, and plaisters for outward. As Self-heal\r\nis like Bugle in form, so also in the qualities and virtues, serving\r\nfor all the purposes whereto Bugle is applied to with good success,\r\neither inwardly or outwardly, for inward wounds or ulcers whatsoever\r\nwithin the body, for bruises or falls, and such like hurts. If it be\r\naccompanied with Bugle, Sanicle, and other the like wound herbs, it\r\nwill be more effectual to wash or inject into ulcers in the parts\r\noutwardly. Where there is cause to repress the heat and sharpness of\r\nhumours flowing to any sore, ulcers, inflammations, swellings, or the\r\nlike, or to stay the fluxes of blood in any wound or part, this is used\r\nwith some good success; as also to cleanse the foulness of sores, and\r\ncause them more speedily to be healed. It is an especial remedy for all\r\ngreen wounds, to solder the lips of them, and to keep the place from\r\nany further inconveniencies. The juice hereof used with oil of roses to\r\nanoint the temples and forehead, is very effectual to remove head ache,\r\nand the same mixed with honey of roses, cleanses and heals all ulcers,\r\nin the mouth, and throat, and those also in the secret parts. And the\r\nproverb of the Germans, French, and others, is verified in this, _That\r\nhe needs neither physician nor surgeon that hath _Self-heal_ and\r\n_Sanicle_ to help himself_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE SERVICE-TREE.\r\n\r\nIT is so well known in the place where it grows, that it needs no\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers before the end of May, and the fruit is ripe in\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Services, when they are mellow, are fit to\r\nbe taken to stay fluxes, scouring, and casting, yet less than medlers.\r\nIf they be dried before they be mellow, and kept all the year, they\r\nmay be used in decoctions for the said purpose, either to drink, or to\r\nbathe the parts requiring it; and are profitably used in that manner to\r\nstay the bleeding of wounds, and of the mouth or nose, to be applied to\r\nthe forehead and nape of the neck; and are under the dominion of Saturn.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SHEPHERD’S PURSE.\r\n\r\nIT is called Whoreman’s Permacety, Shepherd’s Scrip, Shepherd’s Pounce,\r\nToy-wort, Pickpurse, and Casewort.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The root is small, white, and perishes every year. The\r\nleaves are small and long, of a pale green colour, and deeply cut in\r\non both sides, among which spring up a stalk which is small and round,\r\ncontaining small leaves upon it even to the top. The flowers are white\r\nand very small; after which come the little cases which hold the seed,\r\nwhich are flat, almost in the form of a heart.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They are frequent in this nation, almost by every path-side.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower all the Summer long; nay some of them are so\r\nfruitful, that they flower twice a year.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of Saturn, and of\r\na cold, dry, and binding nature, like to him. It helps all fluxes of\r\nblood, either caused by inward or outward wounds; as also flux of the\r\nbelly, and bloody flux, spitting blood, and bloody urine, stops the\r\nterms in women; being bound to the wrists of the hands, and the soles\r\nof the feet, it helps the yellow jaundice. The herb being made into a\r\npoultice, helps inflammations and St. Anthony’s fire. The juice being\r\ndropped into the ears, heals the pains, noise, and mutterings thereof.\r\nA good ointment may be made of it for all wounds, especially wounds in\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SMALLAGE.\r\n\r\nTHIS is also very well known, and therefore I shall not trouble the\r\nreader with any description thereof.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows naturally in dry and marshy ground; but if it be\r\nsown in gardens, it there prospers very well.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It abides green all the Winter, and seeds in August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of Mercury. Smallage is\r\nhotter, drier, and much more medicinal than parsley, for it much more\r\nopens obstructions of the liver and spleen, rarefies thick phlegm,\r\nand cleanses it and the blood withal. It provokes urine and women’s\r\ncourses, and is singularly good against the yellow jaundice, tertian\r\nand quartan agues, if the juice thereof be taken, but especially\r\nmade up into a syrup. The juice also put to honey of roses, and\r\nbarley-water, is very good to gargle the mouth and throat of those\r\nthat have sores and ulcers in them, and will quickly heal them. The\r\nsame lotion also cleanses and heals all other foul ulcers and cankers\r\nelsewhere, if they be washed therewith. The seed is especially used to\r\nbreak and expel wind, to kill worms, and to help a stinking breath.\r\nThe root is effectual to all the purposes aforesaid, and is held\r\nto be stronger in operation than the herb, but especially to open\r\nobstructions, and to rid away any ague, if the juice thereof be taken\r\nin wine, or the decoction thereof in wine used.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SOPEWORT, OR BRUISEWORT.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THE roots creep under ground far and near, with many\r\njoints therein, of a brown colour on the outside and yellowish within,\r\nshooting forth in divers places weak round stalks, full of joints, set\r\nwith two leaves a-piece at every one of them on a contrary side, which\r\nare ribbed somewhat like to plantain, and fashioned like the common\r\nfield white campion leaves, seldom having any branches from the sides\r\nof the stalks, but set with flowers at the top, standing in long husks\r\nlike the wild campions, made of five leaves a-piece, round at the ends,\r\nand dented in the middle, of a rose colour, almost white, sometimes\r\ndeeper, sometimes paler; of a reasonable scent.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows wild in many low and wet grounds of this land, by\r\nbrooks and the sides of running waters.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers usually in July, and so continues all August, and\r\npart of September, before they be quite spent.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Venus owns it. The country people in divers\r\nplaces do use to bruise the leaves of Sopewort, and lay it to their\r\nfingers, hands or legs, when they are cut, to heal them up again. Some\r\nmake great boast thereof, that it is diuretical to provoke urine, and\r\nthereby to expel gravel and the stone in the reins or kidneys, and do\r\nalso account it singularly good to void hydropical waters: and they no\r\nless extol it to perform an absolute cure in the French pox, more than\r\neither sarsaparilla, guiacum, or China can do; which, how true it is, I\r\nleave others to judge.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SORREL.\r\n\r\nOUR ordinary Sorrel, which grows in gardens, and also wild in the\r\nfields, is so well known, that it needs no description.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of Venus. Sorrel\r\nis prevalent in all hot diseases, to cool any inflammation and heat\r\nof blood in agues pestilential or choleric, or sickness and fainting,\r\narising from heat, and to refresh the overspent spirits with the\r\nviolence of furious or fiery fits of agues; to quench thirst, and\r\nprocure an appetite in fainting or decaying stomachs: For it resists\r\nthe putrefaction of the blood, kills worms, and is a cordial to the\r\nheart, which the seed doth more effectually, being more drying and\r\nbinding, and thereby stays the hot fluxes of women’s courses, or of\r\nhumours in the bloody flux, or flux of the stomach. The root also in a\r\ndecoction, or in powder, is effectual for all the said purposes. Both\r\nroots and seeds, as well as the herb, are held powerful to resist the\r\npoison of the scorpion. The decoction of the roots is taken to help\r\nthe jaundice, and to expel the gravel and the stone in the reins or\r\nkidneys. The decoction of the flowers made with wine and drank, helps\r\nthe black jaundice, as also the inward ulcers of the body and bowels. A\r\nsyrup made with the juice of Sorrel and fumitory, is a sovereign help\r\nto kill those sharp humours that cause the itch. The juice thereof,\r\nwith a little vinegar, serves well to be used outwardly for the same\r\ncause, and is also profitable for tetters, ringworms, &c. It helps also\r\nto discuss the kernels in the throat; and the juice gargled in the\r\nmouth, helps the sores therein. The leaves wrapt in a colewort leaf and\r\nroasted in the embers, and applied to a hard imposthume, botch, boil,\r\nor plague sore, doth both ripen and break it. The distilled water of\r\nthe herb is of much good use for all the purposes aforesaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WOOD SORREL.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS grows upon the ground, having a number of leaves\r\ncoming from the root made of three leaves, like a trefoil, but broad\r\nat the ends, and cut in the middle, of a yellowish green colour, every\r\none standing on a long foot-stalk, which at their first coming up are\r\nclose folded together to the stalk, but opening themselves afterwards,\r\nand are of a fine sour relish, and yielding a juice which will turn\r\nred when it is clarified, and makes a most dainty clear syrup. Among\r\nthese leaves rise up divers slender, weak foot-stalks, with every one\r\nof them a flower at the top, consisting of five small pointed leaves,\r\nstar-fashion, of a white colour, in most places, and in some dashed\r\nover with a small show of blueish, on the back side only. After the\r\nflowers are past, follow small round heads, with small yellowish seed\r\nin them. The roots are nothing but small strings fastened to the end of\r\na small long piece; all of them being of a yellowish colour.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in many places of our land, in woods and wood-sides,\r\nwhere they be moist and shadowed, and in other places not too much upon\r\nthe Sun.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in April and May.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Venus owns it. Wood Sorrel serves to all the\r\npurposes that the other Sorrels do, and is more effectual in hindering\r\nputrefaction of blood, and ulcers in the mouth and body, and to quench\r\nthirst, to strengthen a weak stomach, to procure an appetite, to stay\r\nvomiting, and very excellent in any contagious sickness or pestilential\r\nfevers. The syrup made of the juice, is effectual in all the cases\r\naforesaid, and so is the distilled water of the herb. Sponges or linen\r\ncloths wet in the juice and applied outwardly to any hot swelling or\r\ninflammations, doth much cool and help them. The same juice taken\r\nand gargled in the mouth, and after it is spit forth, taken afresh,\r\ndoth wonderfully help a foul stinking canker or ulcer therein. It is\r\nsingularly good to heal wounds, or to stay the bleeding of thrusts or\r\nscabs in the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SOW THISTLE.\r\n\r\nSOW Thistles are generally so well known, that they need no description.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow in gardens and manured grounds, sometimes by old\r\nwalls, pathsides of fields, and high ways.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] This and the former are under the influence\r\nof Venus. Sow Thistles are cooling, and somewhat binding, and are very\r\nfit to cool a hot stomach, and ease the pains thereof. The herb boiled\r\nin wine, is very helpful to stay the dissolution of the stomach, and\r\nthe milk that is taken from the stalks when they are broken, given\r\nin drink, is beneficial to those that are short winded, and have a\r\nwheezing. Pliny saith, That it hath caused the gravel and stone to be\r\nvoided by urine, and that the eating thereof helps a stinking breath.\r\nThe decoction of the leaves and stalks causes abundance of milk in\r\nnurses, and their children to be well coloured. The juice or distilled\r\nwater is good for all hot inflammations, wheals, and eruptions or heat\r\nin the skin, itching of the hæmorrhoids. The juice boiled or thoroughly\r\nheated in a little oil of bitter almonds in the peel of a pomegranate,\r\nand dropped into the ears, is a sure remedy for deafness, singings,\r\n&c. Three spoonfuls of the juice taken, warmed in white wine, and some\r\nwine put thereto, causes women in travail to have so easy and speedy\r\na delivery, that they may be able to walk presently after. It is\r\nwonderful good for women to wash their faces with, to clear the skin,\r\nand give it a lustre.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SOUTHERN WOOD.\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN Wood is so well known to be an ordinary inhabitant in our\r\ngardens, that I shall not need to trouble you with any description\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers for the most part in July and August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a gallant mercurial plant, worthy of\r\nmore esteem than it hath. Dioscorides saith, That the seed bruised,\r\nheated in warm water, and drank, helps those that are bursten, or\r\ntroubled with cramps or convulsions of the sinews, the sciatica, or\r\ndifficulty in making water, and bringing down women’s courses. The same\r\ntaken in wine is an antidote, or counter-poison against all deadly\r\npoison, and drives away serpents and other venomous creatures; as also\r\nthe smell of the herb, being burnt, doth the same. The oil thereof\r\nanointed on the back-bone before the fits of agues come, takes them\r\naway: It takes away inflammations in the eyes, if it be put with some\r\npart of a roasted quince, and boiled with a few crumbs of bread, and\r\napplied. Boiled with barley-meal it takes away pimples, pushes or\r\nwheals that arise in the face, or other parts of the body. The seed as\r\nwell as the dried herb, is often given to kill the worms in children:\r\nThe herb bruised and laid to, helps to draw forth splinters and thorns\r\nout of the flesh. The ashes thereof dries up and heals old ulcers,\r\nthat are without inflammation, although by the sharpness thereof it\r\nbites sore, and puts them to sore pains; as also the sores in the privy\r\nparts of man or woman. The ashes mingled with old sallad oil, helps\r\nthose that have hair fallen, and are bald, causing the hair to grow\r\nagain either on the head or beard. Daranters saith, That the oil made\r\nof Southern-wood, and put among the ointments that are used against\r\nthe French disease, is very effectual, and likewise kills lice in the\r\nhead. The distilled water of the herb is said to help them much that\r\nare troubled with the stone, as also for the diseases of the spleen and\r\nmother. The Germans commend it for a singular wound herb, and therefore\r\ncall it Stabwort. It is held by all writers, ancient and modern, to be\r\nmore offensive to the stomach than worm-wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SPIGNEL, OR SPIKENARD.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THE roots of common Spignel do spread much and deep in\r\nthe ground, many strings or branches growing from one head, which is\r\nhairy at the top, of a blackish brown colour on the outside, and white\r\nwithin, smelling well, and of an aromatical taste from whence rise\r\nsundry long stalks of most fine cut leaves like hair, smaller than\r\ndill, set thick on both sides of the stalks, and of a good scent. Among\r\nthese leaves rise up round stiff stalks, with a few joints and leaves\r\non them, and at the tops an umbel of pure white flowers; at the edges\r\nwhereof sometimes will be seen a shew of the reddish blueish colour,\r\nespecially before they be full blown, and are succeeded by small,\r\nsomewhat round seeds, bigger than the ordinary fennel, and of a brown\r\ncolour, divided into two parts, and crusted on the back, as most of the\r\numbelliferous seeds are.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows wild in Lancashire, Yorkshire, and other northern\r\ncounties, and is also planted in gardens.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of Venus. Galen saith, The\r\nroots of Spignel are available to provoke urine, and women’s courses;\r\nbut if too much thereof be taken, it causes head-ache. The roots\r\nboiled in wine or water, and drank, helps the stranguary and stoppings\r\nof the urine, the wind, swellings and pains in the stomach, pains of\r\nthe mother, and all joint-aches. If the powder of the root be mixed\r\nwith honey, and the same taken as a licking medicine, it breaks tough\r\nphlegm, and dries up the rheum that falls on the lungs. The roots are\r\naccounted very effectual against the stinging or biting of any venomous\r\ncreature.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SPLEENWORT, CETERACH, OR HEART’S\r\n    TONGUE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THE smooth Spleenwort, from a black, thready and bushy\r\nroot, sends forth many long single leaves, cut in on both sides into\r\nround dents almost to the middle, which is not so hard as that of\r\npolypody, each division being not always set opposite unto the other,\r\ncut between each, smooth, and of a light green on the upper side, and a\r\ndark yellowish roughness on the back, folding or rolling itself inward\r\nat the first springing up.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows as well upon stone walls, as moist and shadowy\r\nplaces, about Bristol, and other west parts plentifully; as also on\r\nFramlingham Castle, on Beaconsfield church in Berkshire, at Stroud in\r\nKent, and elsewhere, and abides green all the Winter.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Saturn owns it. It is generally used against\r\ninfirmities of the Spleen: It helps the stranguary, and wasteth the\r\nstone in the bladder, and is good against the yellow jaundice and the\r\nhiccough; but the juice of it in women hinders conception. Matthiolus\r\nsaith, That if a dram of the dust that is on the backside of the leaves\r\nbe mixed with half a dram of amber in powder, and taken with the juice\r\nof purslain or plantain, it helps the gonorrhea speedily, and that the\r\nherb and root being boiled and taken, helps all melancholy diseases,\r\nand those especially that arise from the French diseases. Camerarius\r\nsaith, That the distilled water thereof being drank, is very effectual\r\nagainst the stone in the reins and bladder; and that the lye that is\r\nmade of the ashes thereof being drank for some time together, helps\r\nsplenetic persons. It is used in outward remedies for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n    STAR THISTLE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] A COMMON Star Thistle has divers narrow leaves lying next\r\nthe ground, cut on the edges somewhat deeply into many parts, soft\r\nor a little wooly, all over green, among which rise up divers weak\r\nstalks, parted into many branches: all lying down to the ground, that\r\nit seems a pretty bush, set with divers the like divided leaves up to\r\nthe tops, where severally do stand small whitish green heads, set with\r\nsharp white pricks (no part of the plant else being prickly) which\r\nare somewhat yellowish; out of the middle whereof rises the flowers,\r\ncomposed of many small reddish purple threads; and in the heads, after\r\nthe flowers are past, come small whitish round seed, lying down as\r\nothers do. The root is small, long and woody, perishing every year, and\r\nrising again of its own sowing.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows wild in the fields about London in many places, as\r\nat Mile-End green, and many other places.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers early, and seeds in July, and sometimes in August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] This, as almost all Thistles are, is under\r\nMars. The seed of this Star Thistle made into powder, and drank in\r\nwine, provokes urine, and helps to break the stone, and drives it\r\nforth. The root in powder, and given in wine and drank, is good against\r\nthe plague and pestilence; and drank in the morning fasting for some\r\ntime together, it is very profitable for fistulas in any part of the\r\nbody. Baptista Sardas doth much commend the distilled water thereof,\r\nbeing drank, to help the French disease, to open the obstructions\r\nof the liver, and cleanse the blood from corrupted humours, and is\r\nprofitable against the quotidian or tertian ague.\r\n\r\n\r\n    STRAWBERRIES.\r\n\r\nTHESE are so well known through this land, that they need no\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in May ordinarily, and the fruit is ripe shortly\r\nafter.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Venus owns the herb. Strawberries, when they\r\nare green, are cool and dry; but when they are ripe, they are cool and\r\nmoist: The berries are excellently good to cool the liver, the blood,\r\nand the spleen, or an hot choleric stomach; to refresh and comfort\r\nthe fainting spirits, and quench thirst: They are good also for other\r\ninflammations; yet it is not amiss to refrain from them in a fever,\r\nlest by their putrifying in the stomach they increase the fits. The\r\nleaves and roots boiled in wine and water, and drank, do likewise cool\r\nthe liver and blood, and assuage all inflammations in the reins and\r\nbladder, provoke urine, and allay the heat and sharpness thereof. The\r\nsame also being drank stays the bloody flux and women’s courses, and\r\nhelps the swelling of the spleen. The water of the Berries carefully\r\ndistilled, is a sovereign remedy and cordial in the panting and beating\r\nof the heart, and is good for the yellow jaundice. The juice dropped\r\ninto foul ulcers, or they washed therewith, or the decoction of the\r\nherb and root, doth wonderfully cleanse and help to cure them. Lotions\r\nand gargles for sore mouths, or ulcers therein, or in the privy parts\r\nor elsewhere, are made with the leaves and roots thereof; which is also\r\ngood to fasten loose teeth, and to heal spungy foul gums. It helps also\r\nto stay catarrhs, or defluctions of rheum in the mouth, throat, teeth,\r\nor eyes. The juice or water is singularly good for hot and red inflamed\r\neyes, if dropped into them, or they bathed therewith. It is also of\r\nexcellent property for all pushes, wheals and other breakings forth of\r\nhot and sharp humours in the face and hands, and other parts of the\r\nbody, to bathe them therewith, and to take away any redness in the\r\nface, or spots, or other deformities in the skin, and to make it clear\r\nand smooth. Some use this medicine, Take so many Strawberries as you\r\nshall think fitting, and put them into a distillatory, or body of glass\r\nfit for them, which being well closed, set it in a bed of horse dung\r\nfor your use. It is an excellent water for hot inflamed eyes, and to\r\ntake away a film or skin that begins to grow over them, and for such\r\nother defects in them as may be helped by any outward medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SUCCORY, OR CHICORY.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THE garden Succory hath long and narrower leaves than the\r\nEndive, and more cut in or torn on the edges, and the root abides many\r\nyears. It bears also blue flowers like Endive, and the seed is hardly\r\ndistinguished from the seed of the smooth or ordinary Endive.\r\n\r\nThe wild Succory hath divers long leaves lying on the ground, very much\r\ncut in or torn on the edges, on both sides, even to the middle rib,\r\nending in a point; sometimes it hath a rib down to the middle of the\r\nleaves, from among which rises up a hard, round, woody stalk, spreading\r\ninto many branches, set with smaller and less divided leaves on them up\r\nto the tops, where stand the flowers, which are like the garden kind,\r\nand the seed is also (only take notice that the flowers of the garden\r\nkind are gone in on a sunny day, they being so cold, that they are not\r\nable to endure the beams of the sun, and therefore more delight in the\r\nshade) the root is white, but more hard and woody than the garden kind.\r\nThe whole plant is exceedingly bitter.\r\n\r\n_Place._] This grows in many places of our land in waste untilled and\r\nbarren fields. The other only in gardens.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of Jupiter. Garden Succory,\r\nas it is more dry and less cold than Endive, so it opens more. An\r\nhandful of the leaves, or roots boiled in wine or water, and a draught\r\nthereof drank fasting, drives forth choleric and phlegmatic humours,\r\nopens obstructions of the liver, gall and spleen; helps the yellow\r\njaundice, the heat of the reins, and of the urine; the dropsy also;\r\nand those that have an evil disposition in their bodies, by reason\r\nof long sickness, evil diet, &c. which the Greeks call Cachexia. A\r\ndecoction thereof made with wine, and drank, is very effectual against\r\nlong lingering agues; and a dram of the seed in powder, drank in wine,\r\nbefore the fit of the ague, helps to drive it away. The distilled water\r\nof the herb and flowers (if you can take them in time) hath the like\r\nproperties, and is especially good for hot stomachs, and in agues,\r\neither pestilential or of long continuance; for swoonings and passions\r\nof the heart, for the heat and head-ache in children, and for the blood\r\nand liver. The said water, or the juice, or the bruised leaves applied\r\noutwardly, allay swellings, inflammations, St. Anthony’s fire, pushes,\r\nwheals, and pimples, especially used with a little vinegar; as also to\r\nwash pestiferous sores. The said water is very effectual for sore eyes\r\nthat are inflamed with redness, for nurses’ breasts that are pained by\r\nthe abundance of milk.\r\n\r\nThe wild Succory, as it is more bitter, so it is more strengthening to\r\nthe stomach and liver.\r\n\r\n\r\n    STONE-CROP, PRICK-MADAM, OR SMALL-HOUSELEEK.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] IT grows with divers trailing branches upon the ground,\r\nset with many thick, flat, roundish, whitish green leaves, pointed at\r\nthe ends. The flowers stand many of them together, somewhat loosely.\r\nThe roots are small, and run creeping under ground.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows upon the stone walls and mud walls, upon the tiles\r\nof houses and pent-houses, and amongst rubbish, and in other gravelly\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in June and July, and the leaves are green all the\r\nWinter.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of the Moon,\r\ncold in quality, and something binding, and therefore very good to\r\nstay defluctions, especially such as fall upon the eyes. It stops\r\nbleeding, both inward and outward, helps cankers, and all fretting\r\nsores and ulcers; it abates the heat of choler, thereby preventing\r\ndiseases arising from choleric humours. It expels poison much, resists\r\npestilential fevers, being exceeding good also for tertian agues: You\r\nmay drink the decoction of it, if you please, for all the foregoing\r\ninfirmities. It is so harmless an herb, you can scarce use it amiss:\r\nBeing bruised and applied to the place, it helps the king’s evil, and\r\nany other knots or kernels in the flesh; as also the piles.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ENGLISH TOBACCO.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS rises up with a round thick stalk, about two feet\r\nhigh, whereon do grow thick, flat green leaves, nothing so large as\r\nthe other Indian kind, somewhat round pointed also, and nothing dented\r\nabout the edges. The stalk branches forth, and bears at the tops divers\r\nflowers set on great husks like the other, but nothing so large: scarce\r\nstanding above the brims of the husks, round pointed also, and of a\r\ngreenish yellow colour. The seed that follows is not so bright, but\r\nlarger, contained in the like great heads. The roots are neither so\r\ngreat nor woody; it perishes every year with the hard frosts in Winter,\r\nbut rises generally from its own sowing.\r\n\r\n_Place._] This came from some parts of Brazil, as it is thought, and is\r\nmore familiar in our country than any of the other sorts; early giving\r\nripe seed, which the others seldom do.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers from June, sometimes to the end of August, or\r\nlater, and the seed ripens in the mean time.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a martial plant. It is found by\r\ngood experience to be available to expectorate tough phlegm from the\r\nstomach, chest, and lungs. The juice thereof made into a syrup, or the\r\ndistilled water of the herb drank with some sugar, or without, if you\r\nwill, or the smoak taken by a pipe, as is usual, but fainting, helps\r\nto expel worms in the stomach and belly, and to ease the pains in the\r\nhead, or megrim, and the griping pains in the bowels. It is profitable\r\nfor those that are troubled with the stone in the kidneys, both to\r\nease the pains by provoking urine, and also to expel gravel and the\r\nstone engendered therein, and hath been found very effectual to expel\r\nwindiness, and other humours, which cause the strangling of the mother.\r\nThe seed hereof is very effectual to expel the tooth ache, and the\r\nashes of the burnt herb to cleanse the gums, and make the teeth white.\r\nThe herb bruised and applied to the place grieved with the king’s\r\nevil, helps it in nine or ten days effectually. Monardus saith, it is\r\na counter poison against the biting of any venomous creature, the herb\r\nalso being outwardly applied to the hurt place. The distilled water\r\nis often given with some sugar before the fit of an ague, to lessen\r\nit, and take it away in three or four times using. If the distilled\r\nfæces of the herb, having been bruised before the distillation, and not\r\ndistilled dry, be set in warm dung for fourteen days, and afterwards\r\nbe hung in a bag in a wine cellar, the liquor that distills therefrom\r\nis singularly good to use in cramps, aches, the gout and sciatica,\r\nand to heal itches, scabs, and running ulcers, cankers, and all foul\r\nsores whatsoever. The juice is also good for all the said griefs, and\r\nlikewise to kill lice in children’s heads. The green herb bruised and\r\napplied to any green wounds, cures any fresh wound or cut whatsoever:\r\nand the juice put into old sores, both cleanses and heals them. There\r\nis also made hereof a singularly good salve to help imposthumes, hard\r\ntumours, and other swellings by blows and falls.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE TAMARISK TREE.\r\n\r\nIT is so well known in the place where it grows, that it needs no\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers about the end of May, or June, and the seed is\r\nripe and blown away in the beginning of September.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] A gallant Saturnine herb it is. The root,\r\nleaves, young branches, or bark boiled in wine, and drank, stays the\r\nbleeding of the hæmorrhodical veins, the spitting of blood, the too\r\nabounding of women’s courses, the jaundice, the cholic, and the biting\r\nof all venomous serpents, except the asp; and outwardly applied, is\r\nvery powerful against the hardness of the spleen, and the tooth-ache,\r\npains in the ears, red and watering eyes. The decoction, with some\r\nhoney put thereto, is good to stay gangrenes and fretting ulcers, and\r\nto wash those that are subject to nits and lice. Alpinus and Veslingius\r\naffirm, That the Egyptians do with good success use the wood of it to\r\ncure the French disease, as others do with lignum vitæ or guiacum; and\r\ngive it also to those who have the leprosy, scabs, ulcers, or the like.\r\nIts ashes doth quickly heal blisters raised by burnings or scaldings.\r\nIt helps the dropsy, arising from the hardness of the spleen, and\r\ntherefore to drink out of cups made of the wood is good for splenetic\r\npersons. It is also helpful for melancholy, and the black jaundice that\r\narise thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GARDEN TANSY.\r\n\r\nGARDEN Tansy is so well known, that it needs no description.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in June and July.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Dame Venus was minded to pleasure women with\r\nchild by this herb, for there grows not an herb, fitter for their use\r\nthan this is; it is just as though it were cut out for the purpose.\r\nThis herb bruised and applied to the navel, stays miscarriages; I\r\nknow no herb like it for that use: Boiled in ordinary beer, and the\r\ndecoction drank, doth the like; and if her womb be not as she would\r\nhave it, this decoction will make it so. Let those women that desire\r\nchildren love this herb, it is their best companion, their husbands\r\nexcepted. Also it consumes the phlegmatic humours, the cold and\r\nmoist constitution of Winter most usually affects the body of man\r\nwith, and that was the first reason of eating tansies in the Spring.\r\nThe decoction of the common Tansy, or the juice drank in wine, is a\r\nsingular remedy for all the griefs that come by slopping of the urine,\r\nhelps the stranguary and those that have weak reins and kidneys. It is\r\nalso very profitable to dissolve and expel wind in the stomach, belly,\r\nor bowels, to procure women’s courses, and expel windiness in the\r\nmatrix, if it be bruised and often smelled unto, as also applied to the\r\nlower part of the belly. It is also very profitable for such women as\r\nare given to miscarry. It is used also against the stone in the reins,\r\nespecially to men. The herb fried with eggs (as it is the custom in\r\nthe Spring-time) which is called a Tansy, helps to digest and carry\r\ndownward those bad humours that trouble the stomach. The seed is very\r\nprofitably given to children for the worms, and the juice in drink is\r\nas effectual. Being boiled in oil, it is good for the sinews shrunk by\r\ncramps, or pained with colds, if thereto applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILD TANSY, OR SILVER WEED.\r\n\r\nTHIS is also so well known, that it needs no description.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in every place.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in June and July.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Now Dame Venus hath fitted women with\r\ntwo herbs of one name, the one to help conception, and the other to\r\nmaintain beauty, and what more can be expected of her? What now remains\r\nfor you, but to love your husbands, and not to be wanting to your poor\r\nneighbours? Wild Tansy stays the lask, and all the fluxes of blood in\r\nmen and women, which some say it will do, if the green herb be worn in\r\nthe shoes, so it be next the skin; and it is true enough, that it will\r\nstop the terms, if worn so, and the whites too, for ought I know. It\r\nstays also spitting or vomiting of blood. The powder of the herb taken\r\nin some of the distilled water, helps the whites in women, but more\r\nespecially if a little coral and ivory in powder be put to it. It is\r\nalso recommended to help children that are bursten, and have a rupture,\r\nbeing boiled in water and salt. Being boiled in water and drank, it\r\neases the griping pains of the bowels, and is good for the sciatica\r\nand joint-aches. The same boiled in vinegar, with honey and allum,\r\nand gargled in the mouth, eases the pains of the tooth-ache, fastens\r\nloose teeth, helps the gums that are sore, and settles the palate of\r\nthe mouth in its place, when it is fallen down. It cleanses and heals\r\nulcers in the mouth, or secret parts, and is very good for inward\r\nwounds, and to close the lips of green wounds, and to heal old, moist,\r\nand corrupt running sores in the legs or elsewhere. Being bruised\r\nand applied to the soles of the feet and hand wrists, it wonderfully\r\ncools the hot fits of agues, be they never so violent. The distilled\r\nwater cleanses the skin of all discolourings therein, as morphew,\r\nsun-burnings, &c. as also pimples, freckles, and the like; and dropped\r\ninto the eyes, or cloths wet therein and applied, takes away the heat\r\nand inflammations in them.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THISTLES.\r\n\r\nOF these are many kinds growing here in England which are so well\r\nknown, that they need no description: Their difference is easily known\r\non the places where they grow, _viz._\r\n\r\n_Place._] Some grow in fields, some in meadows, and some among the\r\ncorn; others on heaths, greens, and waste grounds in many places.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in June and August and their seed is ripe quickly\r\nafter.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Surely Mars rules it, it is such a prickly\r\nbusiness. All these thistles are good to provoke urine, and to mend\r\nthe stinking smell thereof; as also the rank smell of the arm-pits, or\r\nthe whole body; being boiled in wine and drank, and are said to help a\r\nstinking breath, and to strengthen the stomach. Pliny saith, That the\r\njuice bathed on the place that wants hair, it being fallen off, will\r\ncause it to grow speedily.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE MELANCHOLY THISTLE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] IT rises up with tender single hoary green stalks, bearing\r\nthereon four or five green leaves, dented about the edges; the points\r\nthereof are little or nothing prickly, and at the top usually but one\r\nhead, yet sometimes from the bosom of the uppermost leaves there shoots\r\nforth another small head, scaly and prickly, with many reddish thrumbs\r\nor threads in the middle, which being gathered fresh, will keep the\r\ncolour a long time, and fades not from the stalk a long time, while it\r\nperfects the seed, which is of a mean bigness, lying in the down. The\r\nroot hath many strings fastened to the head, or upper part, which is\r\nblackish, and perishes not.\r\n\r\nThere is another sort little differing from the former, but that the\r\nleaves are more green above, and more hoary underneath, and the stalk\r\nbeing about two feet high, bears but one scaly head, with threads and\r\nseeds as the former.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow in many moist meadows of this land, as well in the\r\nsouthern, as in the northern parts.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower about July or August, and their seed ripens\r\nquickly after.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under Capricorn, and therefore under\r\nboth Saturn and Mars, one rids melancholy by sympathy, the other by\r\nantipathy. Their virtues are but few, but those not to be despised; for\r\nthe decoction of the thistle in wine being drank, expels superfluous\r\nmelancholy out of the body, and makes a man as merry as a cricket;\r\nsuperfluous melancholy causes care, fear, sadness, despair, envy,\r\nand many evils more besides; but religion teaches to wait upon God’s\r\nprovidence, and cast our care upon him who cares for us. What a fine\r\nthing were it if men and women could live so? And yet seven years’\r\ncare and fear makes a man never the wiser, nor a farthing richer.\r\nDioscorides saith, the root borne about one doth the like, and removes\r\nall diseases of melancholy. Modern writers laugh at him; _Let them\r\nlaugh that win_: my opinion is, that it is the best remedy against all\r\nmelancholy diseases that grows; they that please may use it.\r\n\r\n\r\n    OUR LADY’S THISTLE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] OUR Lady’s Thistle hath divers very large and broad leaves\r\nlying on the ground cut in, and as it were crumpled, but somewhat hairy\r\non the edges, of a white green shining colour, wherein are many lines\r\nand streaks of a milk white colour, running all over, and set with many\r\nsharp and stiff prickles all about, among which rises up one or more\r\nstrong, round, and prickly stalks, set full of the like leaves up to\r\nthe top, where at the end of every branch, comes forth a great prickly\r\nThistle-like head, strongly armed with prickles, and with bright purple\r\nthumbs rising out of the middle; after they are past, the seed grows in\r\nthe said heads, lying in soft white down, which is somewhat flattish\r\nin the ground, and many strings and fibres fastened thereunto. All the\r\nwhole plant is bitter in taste.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It is frequent on the banks of almost every ditch.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers and seeds in June, July, and August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Our Lady’s Thistle is under Jupiter, and\r\nthought to be as effectual as Carduus Benedictus for agues, and to\r\nprevent and cure the infection of the plague: as also to open the\r\nobstructions of the liver and spleen, and thereby is good against the\r\njaundice. It provokes urine, breaks and expels the stone, and is good\r\nfor the dropsy. It is effectual also for the pains in the sides, and\r\nmany other inward pains and gripings. The seed and distilled water\r\nis held powerful to all the purposes aforesaid, and besides, it is\r\noften applied both outwardly with cloths or spunges to the region of\r\nthe liver, to cool the distemper thereof, and to the region of the\r\nheart, against swoonings and the passions of it. It cleanses the blood\r\nexceedingly: and in Spring, if you please to boil the tender plant (but\r\ncut off the prickles, unless you have a mind to choak yourself) it will\r\nchange your blood as the season changes, and that is the way to be safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE WOOLLEN, OR, COTTON THISTLE.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS has many large leaves lying upon the ground, somewhat\r\ncut in, and as it were crumpled on the edges, of a green colour on the\r\nupper side, but covered over with a long hairy wool or cotton down, set\r\nwith most sharp and cruel pricks; from the middle of whose heads of\r\nflowers come forth many purplish crimson threads, and sometimes white,\r\nalthough but seldom. The seed that follow in those white downy heads,\r\nis somewhat large and round, resembling the seed of Lady’s Thistle, but\r\npaler. The root is great and thick, spreading much, yet usually dies\r\nafter seed time.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows on divers ditch-banks, and in the corn-fields,\r\nand highways, generally throughout the land, and is often growing in\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a plant of Mars. Dioscorides and Pliny\r\nwrite, That the leaves and roots hereof taken in drink, help those that\r\nhave a crick in their neck, that they cannot turn it, unless they turn\r\ntheir whole body. Galen saith, That the roots and leaves hereof are\r\ngood for such persons that have their bodies drawn together by some\r\nspasm or convulsion, or other infirmities; as the rickets (or as the\r\ncollege of physicians would have it, Rachites, about which name they\r\nhave quarrelled sufficiently) in children, being a disease that hinders\r\ntheir growth, by binding their nerves, ligaments, and whole structure\r\nof their body.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE FULLER’S THISTLE, OR TEASLE.\r\n\r\nIT is so well known, that it needs no description, being used with the\r\nclothworkers.\r\n\r\nThe wild Teasle is in all things like the former, but that the prickles\r\nare small, soft, and upright, not hooked or stiff, and the flowers\r\nof this are of a fine blueish, or pale carnation colour, but of the\r\nmanured kind, whitish.\r\n\r\n_Place._] The first grows, being sown in gardens or fields for the use\r\nof clothworkers: The other near ditches and rills of water in many\r\nplaces of this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in July, and are ripe in the end of August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of Venus. Dioscorides saith,\r\nThat the root bruised and boiled in wine, till it be thick, and kept\r\nin a brazen vessel, and after spread as a salve, and applied to the\r\nfundament, doth heal the cleft thereof, cankers and fistulas therein,\r\nalso takes away warts and wens. The juice of the leaves dropped into\r\nthe ears, kills worms in them. The distilled water of the leaves\r\ndropped into the eyes, takes away redness and mists in them that\r\nhinder the sight, and is often used by women to preserve their beauty,\r\nand to take away redness and inflammations, and all other heat or\r\ndiscolourings.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TREACLE MUSTARD.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] IT rises up with a hard round stalk, about a foot high,\r\nparted into some branches, having divers soft green leaves, long\r\nand narrow, set thereon, waved, but not cut into the edges, broadest\r\ntowards the ends, somewhat round pointed; the flowers are white that\r\ngrow at the tops of the branches, spike-fashion, one above another;\r\nafter which come round pouches, parted in the middle with a furrow,\r\nhaving one blackish brown seed on either side, somewhat sharp in taste,\r\nand smelling of garlick, especially in the fields where it is natural,\r\nbut not so much in gardens: The roots are small and thready, perishing\r\nevery year.\r\n\r\nGive me leave here to add Mithridate Mustard, although it may seem more\r\nproperly by the name to belong to M, in the alphabet.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MITHRIDATE MUSTARD.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS grows higher than the former, spreading more and\r\nhigher branches, whose leaves are smaller and narrower, sometimes\r\nunevenly dented about the edges. The flowers are small and white,\r\ngrowing on long branches, with much smaller and rounder vessels after\r\nthem, and parted in the same manner, having smaller brown seeds than\r\nthe former, and much sharper in taste. The root perishes after seed\r\ntime, but abides the first Winter after springing.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow in sundry places in this land, as half a mile from\r\nHatfield, by the river side, under a hedge as you go to Hatfield, and\r\nin the street of Peckham on Surrey side.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower and seed from May to August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Both of them are herbs of Mars. The Mustards\r\nare said to purge the body both upwards and downwards, and procure\r\nwomen’s courses so abundantly, that it suffocates the birth. It breaks\r\ninward imposthumes, being taken inwardly; and used in clysters, helps\r\nthe sciatica. The seed applied, doth the same. It is an especial\r\ningredient in mithridate and treacle, being of itself an antidote\r\nresisting poison, venom and putrefaction. It is also available in many\r\ncases for which the common Mustard is used, but somewhat weaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE BLACK THORN, OR SLOE-BUSH.\r\n\r\nIT is so well known, that it needs no description.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in every county in the hedges and borders of fields.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in April, and sometimes in March, but the fruit\r\nripens after all other plums whatsoever, and is not fit to be eaten\r\nuntil the Autumn frost mellow them.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] All the parts of the Sloe-Bush are binding,\r\ncooling, and dry, and all effectual to stay bleeding at the nose and\r\nmouth, or any other place; the lask of the belly or stomach, or the\r\nbloody flux, the too much abounding of women’s courses, and helps\r\nto ease the pains of the sides, and bowels, that come by overmuch\r\nscouring, to drink the decoction of the bark of the roots, or more\r\nusually the decoction of the berries, either fresh or dried. The\r\nconserve also is of very much use, and more familiarly taken for the\r\npurposes aforesaid. But the distilled water of the flower first steeped\r\nin sack for a night, and drawn therefrom by the heat of Balneum and\r\nAnglico, a bath, is a most certain remedy, tried and approved, to\r\nease all manner of gnawings in the stomach, the sides and bowels,\r\nor any griping pains in any of them, to drink a small quantity when\r\nthe extremity of pain is upon them. The leaves also are good to make\r\nlotions to gargle and wash the mouth and throat, wherein are swellings,\r\nsores, or kernels; and to stay the defluctions of rheum to the eyes,\r\nor other parts; as also to cool the heat and inflammations of them,\r\nand ease hot pains of the head, to bathe the forehead and temples\r\ntherewith. The simple distilled water of the flowers is very effectual\r\nfor the said purposes, and the condensate juice of the Sloes. The\r\ndistilled water of the green berries is used also for the said effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THOROUGH WAX, OR THOROUGH LEAF.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] COMMON Thorough-Wax sends forth a strait round stalk, two\r\nfeet high, or better, whose lower leaves being of a bluish colour, are\r\nsmaller and narrower than those up higher, and stand close thereto,\r\nnot compassing it; but as they grow higher, they do not encompass\r\nthe stalks, until it wholly pass through them, branching toward the\r\ntop into many parts, where the leaves grow smaller again, every one\r\nstanding singly, and never two at a joint. The flowers are small\r\nand yellow, standing in tufts at the heads of the branches, where\r\nafterwards grow the seed, being blackish, many thick thrust together.\r\nThe root is small, long and woody, perishing every year, after\r\nseed-time, and rising again plentifully of its own sowing.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It is found growing in many corn-fields and pasture grounds\r\nin this land.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in July, and the seed is ripe in August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Both this and the former are under the\r\ninfluence of Saturn. Thorough-Wax is of singular good use for all sorts\r\nof bruises and wounds either inward or outward; and old ulcers and\r\nsores likewise, if the decoction of the herb with water and wine be\r\ndrank, and the place washed therewith, or the juice of the green herb\r\nbruised, or boiled, either by itself, or with other herbs, in oil or\r\nhog’s grease, to be made into an ointment to serve all the year. The\r\ndecoction of the herb, or powder of the dried herb, taken inwardly, and\r\nthe same, or the leaves bruised, and applied outwardly, is singularly\r\ngood for all ruptures and burstings, especially in children before they\r\nbe too old. Being applied with a little flour and wax to children’s\r\nnavels that stick forth, it helps them.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THYME.\r\n\r\nIT is in vain to describe an herb so commonly known.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a noble strengthener of the lungs, as\r\nnotable a one as grows; neither is there scarce a better remedy growing\r\nfor that disease in children which they commonly call the Chin-cough,\r\nthan it is. It purges the body of phlegm, and is an excellent remedy\r\nfor shortness of breath. It kills worms in the belly, and being a\r\nnotable herb of Venus, provokes the terms, gives safe and speedy\r\ndelivery to women in travail, and brings away the after birth. It is so\r\nharmless you need not fear the use of it. An ointment made of it takes\r\naway hot swellings and warts, helps the sciatica and dullness of sight,\r\nand takes away pains and hardness of the spleen. ’Tis excellent for\r\nthose that are troubled with the gout. It eases pains in the loins and\r\nhips. The herb taken any way inwardly, comforts the stomach much, and\r\nexpels wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILD THYME, OR MOTHER OF THYME.\r\n\r\nWILD Thyme also is so well known, that it needs no description.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It may be found commonly in commons, and other barren places\r\nthroughout the nation.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of Venus, and\r\nunder the sign Aries, and therefore chiefly appropriated to the head.\r\nIt provokes urine and the terms, and eases the griping pain of the\r\nbelly, cramps, ruptures, and inflamation of the liver. If you make a\r\nvinegar of the herb, as vinegar of roses is made (you may find out\r\nthe way in my translation of the London Dispensatory) and anoint the\r\nhead with it, it presently stops the pains thereof. It is excellently\r\ngood to be given either in phrenzy or lethargy, although they are two\r\ncontrary diseases: It helps spitting and voiding of blood, coughing,\r\nand vomiting; it comforts and strengthens the head, stomach, reins, and\r\nwomb, expels wind, and breaks the stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TORMENTIL, OR SEPTFOIL.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS hath reddish, slender, weak branches rising from the\r\nroot, lying on the ground, rather leaning than standing upright, with\r\nmany short leaves that stand closer to the stalk than cinquefoil (to\r\nwhich this is very like) with the root-stalk compassing the branches\r\nin several places; but those that grow to the ground are set upon\r\nlong foot stalks, each whereof are like the leaves of cinquefoil, but\r\nsomewhat long and lesser dented about the edges, many of them divided\r\ninto five leaves, but most of them into seven, whence it is also called\r\nSeptfoil; yet some may have six, and some eight, according to the\r\nfertility of the soil. At the tops of the branches stand divers small\r\nyellow flowers, consisting of five leaves, like those of cinquefoil,\r\nbut smaller. The root is smaller than bistort, somewhat thick, but\r\nblacker without, and not so red within, yet sometimes a little crooked,\r\nhaving blackish fibres thereat.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows as well in woods and shadowy places, as in the open\r\nchampain country, about the borders of fields in many places of this\r\nland, and almost in every broom field in Essex.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers all the Summer long.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] This is a gallant herb of the Sun. Tormentil\r\nis most excellent to stay all kind of fluxes of blood or humours in man\r\nor woman, whether at nose, mouth, or belly. The juice of the herb and\r\nroot, or the decoction thereof, taken with some Venice treacle, and\r\nthe person laid to sweat, expels any venom or poison, or the plague,\r\nfever, or other contagious diseases, as pox, measles, &c. for it is an\r\ningredient in all antidotes or counter poisons. Andreas Urlesius is of\r\nopinion that the decoction of this root is no less effectual to cure\r\nthe French pox than Guiacum or China; and it is not unlikely, because\r\nit so mightily resists putrefaction. The root taken inwardly is most\r\neffectual to help any flux of the belly, stomach, spleen, or blood; and\r\nthe juice wonderfully opens obstructions of the liver and lungs, and\r\nthereby helps the yellow jaundice. The powder or decoction drank, or\r\nto sit thereon as a bath, is an assured remedy against abortion, if it\r\nproceed from the over flexibility or weakness of the inward retentive\r\nfaculty; as also a plaster made therewith, and vinegar applied to\r\nthe reins of the back, doth much help not only this, but also those\r\nthat cannot hold their water, the powder being taken in the juice of\r\nplantain, and is also commended against the worms in children. It\r\nis very powerful in ruptures and burstings, as also for bruises and\r\nfalls, to be used as well outwardly as inwardly. The root hereof made\r\nup with pellitory of Spain and allum, and put into a hollow tooth, not\r\nonly assuages the pain, but stays the flux of humours which causes it.\r\nTormentil is no less effectual and powerful a remedy against outward\r\nwounds, sores and hurts, than for inward, and is therefore a special\r\ningredient to be used in wound drinks, lotions and injections, for\r\nfoul corrupt rotten sores and ulcers of the mouth, secrets, or other\r\nparts of the body. The juice or powder of the root put in ointments,\r\nplaisters, and such things that are to be applied to wounds or sores,\r\nis very effectual, as the juice of the leaves and the root bruised\r\nand applied to the throat or jaws, heals the king’s evil, and eases\r\nthe pain of the sciatica; the same used with a little vinegar, is a\r\nspecial remedy against the running sores of the head or other parts;\r\nscabs also, and the itch or any such eruptions in the skin, proceeding\r\nof salt and sharp humours. The same is also effectual for the piles\r\nor hæmorrhoids, if they be washed or bathed therewith, or with the\r\ndistilled water of the herb and roots. It is found also helpful to dry\r\nup any sharp rheum that distills from the head into the eyes, causing\r\nredness, pain, waterings, itching, or the like, if a little prepared\r\ntutia, or white amber, be used with the distilled water thereof. And\r\nhere is enough, only remember the Sun challengeth this herb.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TURNSOLE, OR HELIOTROPIUM.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THE greater Turnsole rises with one upright stalk, about a\r\nfoot high, or more, dividing itself almost from the bottom, into divers\r\nsmall branches, of a hoary colour; at each joint of the stalk and\r\nbranches grow small broad leaves, somewhat white and hairy. At the tops\r\nof the stalks and branches stand small white flowers, consisting of\r\nfour, and sometimes five small leaves, set in order one above another,\r\nupon a small crooked spike, which turns inwards like a bowed finger,\r\nopening by degrees as the flowers blow open; after which in their place\r\ncome forth cornered seed, four for the most part standing together; the\r\nroot is small and thready, perishing every year, and the seed shedding\r\nevery year, raises it again the next spring.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in gardens, and flowers and seeds with us,\r\nnotwithstanding it is not natural to this land, but to Italy, Spain,\r\nand France, where it grows plentifully.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of the Sun, and a good one\r\ntoo. Dioscorides saith, That a good handful of this, which is called\r\nthe Great Turnsole, boiled in water, and drank, purges both choler and\r\nphlegm; and boiled with cummin, helps the stone in the reins, kidneys,\r\nor bladder, provokes urine and women’s courses, and causes an easy\r\nand speedy delivery in child-birth. The leaves bruised and applied to\r\nplaces pained with the gout, or that have been out of joint and newly\r\nset, and full of pain, do give much ease; the seed and juice of the\r\nleaves also being rubbed with a little salt upon warts and wens, and\r\nother kernels in the face, eye-lids, or any other part of the body,\r\nwill, by often using, take them away.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MEADOW TREFOIL, OR HONEYSUCKLES.\r\n\r\nIT is so well known, especially by the name of Honeysuckles, white and\r\nred, that I need not describe them.\r\n\r\n_Place._] They grow almost every where in this land.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Mercury hath dominion over the common sort.\r\nDodoneus saith, The leaves and flowers are good to ease the griping\r\npains of the gout, the herb being boiled and used in a clyster. If\r\nthe herb be made into a poultice, and applied to inflammations, it\r\nwill ease them. The juice dropped in the eyes, is a familiar medicine,\r\nwith many country people, to take away the pin and web (as they call\r\nit) in the eyes; it also allays the heat and blood shooting of them.\r\nCountry people do also in many places drink the juice thereof against\r\nthe biting of an adder; and having boiled the herb in water, they\r\nfirst wash the place with the decoction, and then lay some of the herb\r\nalso to the hurt place. The herb also boiled in swine’s grease, and so\r\nmade into an ointment, is good to apply to the biting of any venomous\r\ncreature. The herb also bruised and heated between tiles, and applied\r\nhot to the share, causes them to make water who had it stopt before.\r\nIt is held likewise to be good for wounds, and to take away seed. The\r\ndecoction of the herb and flowers, with the seed and root, taken for\r\nsome time, helps women that are troubled with the whites. The seed and\r\nflowers boiled in water, and afterwards made into a poultice with some\r\noil, and applied, helps hard swellings and imposthumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n    HEART TREFOIL.\r\n\r\nBESIDES the ordinary sort of Trefoil, here are two more remarkable, and\r\none of which may be properly called Heart Trefoil, not only because the\r\nleaf is triangular, like the heart of a man, but also because each leaf\r\ncontains the perfection of a heart, and that in its proper colour, viz.\r\na flesh colour.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows between Longford and Bow, and beyond Southwark, by\r\nthe highway and parts adjacent.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of the Sun, and if\r\nit were used, it would be found as great a strengthener of the heart,\r\nand cherisher of the vital spirits as grows, relieving the body against\r\nfainting and swoonings, fortifying it against poison and pestilence,\r\ndefending the heart against the noisome vapours of the spleen.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEARL TREFOIL.\r\n\r\nIT differs not from the common sort, save only in this particular, it\r\nhath a white spot in the leaf like a pearl. It is particularly under\r\nthe dominion of the Moon, and its icon shews that it is of a singular\r\nvirtue against the pearl, or pin and web in the eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TUSTAN, OR PARK LEAVES.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] IT hath brownish shining round stalks, crested the length\r\nthereof, rising two by two, and sometimes three feet high, branching\r\nforth even from the bottom, having divers joints, and at each of them\r\ntwo fair large leaves standing, of a dark blueish green colour on the\r\nupper side, and of a yellowish green underneath, turning reddish toward\r\nAutumn. At the top of the stalks stand large yellow flowers, and heads\r\nwith seed, which being greenish at the first and afterwards reddish,\r\nturn to be of a blackish purple colour when they are ripe, with small\r\nbrownish seed within them, and they yield a reddish juice or liquor,\r\nsomewhat resinous, and of a harsh and stypick taste, as the leaves also\r\nand the flowers be, although much less, but do not yield such a clear\r\nclaret wine colour, as some say it doth, the root is brownish, somewhat\r\ngreat, hard and woody, spreading well in the ground.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows in many woods, groves, and woody grounds, as parks\r\nand forests, and by hedge-sides in many places in this land, as in\r\nHampstead wood, by Ratley in Essex, in the wilds of Kent, and in many\r\nother places needless to recite.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers later than St. John’s or St. Peter’s-wort.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is an herb of Saturn, and a most noble\r\nanti-venerean. Tustan purges choleric humours, as St. Peter’s-wort,\r\nis said to do, for therein it works the same effects, both to help\r\nthe sciatica and gout, and to heal burning by fire; it stays all the\r\nbleedings of wounds, if either the green herb be bruised, or the powder\r\nof the dry be applied thereto. It hath been accounted, and certainly it\r\nis, a sovereign herb to heal either wound or sore, either outwardly or\r\ninwardly, and therefore always used in drinks, lotions, balms, oils,\r\nointments, or any other sorts of green wounds, ulcers, or old sores, in\r\nall which the continual experience of former ages hath confirmed the\r\nuse thereof to be admirably good, though it be not so much in use now,\r\nas when physicians and surgeons were so wise as to use herbs more than\r\nnow they do.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GARDEN VALERIAN.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS hath a thick short greyish root, lying for the most\r\npart above ground, shooting forth on all other sides such like small\r\npieces of roots, which have all of them many long green strings and\r\nfibres under them in the ground, whereby it draws nourishment. From\r\nthe head of these roots spring up many green leaves, which at first\r\nare somewhat broad and long, without any divisions at all in them, or\r\ndenting on the edges; but those that rise up after are more and more\r\ndivided on each side, some to the middle rib, being winged, as made of\r\nmany leaves together on a stalk, and those upon a stalk, in like manner\r\nmore divided, but smaller towards the top than below; the stalk rises\r\nto be a yard high or more, sometimes branched at the top, with many\r\nsmall whitish flowers, sometimes dashed over at the edges with a pale\r\npurplish colour, of a little scent, which passing away, there follows\r\nsmall brownish white seed, that is easily carried away with the wind.\r\nThe root smells more strong than either leaf or flower, and is of more\r\nuse in medicines.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It is generally kept with us in gardens.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in June and July, and continues flowering until the\r\nfrost pull it down.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] This is under the influence of Mercury.\r\nDioscorides saith, That the Garden Valerian hath a warming faculty,\r\nand that being dried and given to drink it provokes urine, and helps\r\nthe stranguary. The decoction thereof taken, doth the like also, and\r\ntakes away pains of the sides, provokes women’s courses, and is used\r\nin antidotes. Pliny saith, That the powder of the root given in drink,\r\nor the decoction thereof taken, helps all stoppings and stranglings\r\nin any part of the body, whether they proceed of pains in the chest\r\nor sides, and takes them away. The root of Valerian boiled with\r\nliquorice, raisins, and anniseed, is singularly good for those that are\r\nshort-winded, and for those that are troubled with the cough, and helps\r\nto open the passages, and to expectorate phlegm easily. It is given to\r\nthose that are bitten or stung by any venomous creature, being boiled\r\nin wine. It is of a special virtue against the plague, the decoction\r\nthereof being drank, and the root being used to smell to. It helps\r\nto expel the wind in the belly. The green herb with the root taken\r\nfresh, being bruised and applied to the head, takes away the pains and\r\nprickings there, stays rheum and thin distillation, and being boiled\r\nin white wine, and a drop thereof put into the eyes, takes away the\r\ndimness of the sight, or any pin or web therein. It is of excellent\r\nproperty to heal any inward sores or wounds, and also for outward hurts\r\nor wounds, and drawing away splinters or thorns out of the flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n    VERVAIN.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THE common Vervain hath somewhat long broad leaves next\r\nthe ground deeply gashed about the edges, and some only deeply dented,\r\nor cut all alike, of a blackish green colour on the upper side,\r\nsomewhat grey underneath. The stalk is square, branched into several\r\nparts, rising about two feet high, especially if you reckon the long\r\nspike of flowers at the tops of them, which are set on all sides one\r\nabove another, and sometimes two or three together, being small and\r\ngaping, of a blue colour and white intermixed, after which come small\r\nround seed, in small and somewhat long heads. The root is small and\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows generally throughout this land in divers places of\r\nthe hedges and way-sides, and other waste grounds.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in July, and the seed is ripe soon after.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] This is an herb of Venus, and excellent\r\nfor the womb to strengthen and remedy all the cold griefs of it, as\r\nPlantain doth the hot. Vervain is hot and dry, opening obstructions,\r\ncleansing and healing. It helps the yellow jaundice, the dropsy and the\r\ngout; it kills and expels worms in the belly, and causes a good colour\r\nin the face and body, strengthens as well as corrects the diseases\r\nof the stomach, liver, and spleen; helps the cough, wheezings, and\r\nshortness of breath, and all the defects of the reins and bladder,\r\nexpelling the gravel and stone. It is held to be good against the\r\nbiting of serpents, and other venomous beasts, against the plague,\r\nand both tertian and quartan agues. It consolidates and heals also\r\nall wounds, both inward and outward, stays bleedings, and used with\r\nsome honey, heals all old ulcers and fistulas in the legs or other\r\nparts of the body; as also those ulcers that happen in the mouth; or\r\nused with hog’s grease, it helps the swellings and pains of the secret\r\nparts in man or woman, also for the piles or hæmorrhoids; applied with\r\nsome oil of roses and vinegar unto the forehead and temples, it eases\r\nthe inveterate pains and ache of the head, and is good for those that\r\nare frantic. The leaves bruised, or the juice of them mixed with some\r\nvinegar, doth wonderfully cleanse the skin, and takes away morphew,\r\nfreckles, fistulas, and other such like inflamations and deformities\r\nof the skin in any parts of the body. The distilled water of the herb\r\nwhen it is in full strength, dropped into the eyes, cleanses them\r\nfrom films, clouds, or mists, that darken the sight, and wonderfully\r\nstrengthens the optic nerves. The said water is very powerful in all\r\nthe diseases aforesaid, either inward or outward, whether they be old\r\ncorroding sores, or green wounds. The dried root, and peeled, is known\r\nto be excellently good against all scrophulous and scorbutic habits\r\nof body, by being tied to the pit of the stomach, by a piece of white\r\nribband round the neck.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE VINE.\r\n\r\nTHE leaves of the English vine (I do not mean to send you to the\r\nCanaries for a medicine) being boiled, makes a good lotion for sore\r\nmouths; being boiled with barley meal into a poultice, it cools\r\ninflammations of wounds; the dropping of the vine, when it is cut in\r\nthe Spring, which country people call Tears, being boiled in a syrup,\r\nwith sugar, and taken inwardly, is excellent to stay women’s longings\r\nafter every thing they see, which is a disease many women with child\r\nare subject to. The decoction of Vine leaves in white wine doth the\r\nlike. Also the tears of the Vine, drank two or three spoonfuls at a\r\ntime, breaks the stone in the bladder. This is a very good remedy, and\r\nit is discreetly done, to kill a Vine to cure a man, but the salt of\r\nthe leaves are held to be better. The ashes of the burnt branches will\r\nmake teeth that are as black as a coal, to be as white as snow, if you\r\nbut every morning rub them with it. It is a most gallant Tree of the\r\nSun, very sympathetical with the body of men, and that is the reason\r\nspirit of wine is the greatest cordial among all vegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\n    VIOLETS.\r\n\r\nBOTH the tame and the wild are so well known, that they need no\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower until the end of July, but are best in March, and\r\nthe beginning of April.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] They are a fine pleasing plant of Venus,\r\nof a mild nature, no way harmful. All the Violets are cold and moist\r\nwhile they are fresh and green, and are used to cool any heat,\r\nor distemperature of the body, either inwardly or outwardly, as\r\ninflammations in the eyes, in the matrix or fundament, in imposthumes\r\nalso, and hot swellings, to drink the decoction of the leaves and\r\nflowers made with water in wine, or to apply them poultice-wise to the\r\ngrieved places: it likewise eases pains in the head, caused through\r\nwant of sleep; or any other pains arising of heat, being applied in\r\nthe same manner, or with oil of roses. A dram weight of the dried\r\nleaves or flower of Violets, but the leaves more strongly, doth purge\r\nthe body of choleric humours, and assuages the heat, being taken in a\r\ndraught of wine, or any other drink; the powder of the purple leaves\r\nof the flowers, only picked and dried and drank in water, is said to\r\nhelp the quinsy, and the falling-sickness in children, especially in\r\nthe beginning of the disease. The flowers of the white Violets ripen\r\nand dissolve swellings. The herb or flowers, while they are fresh, or\r\nthe flowers when they are dry, are effectual in the pleurisy, and all\r\ndiseases of the lungs, to lenify the sharpness in hot rheums, and the\r\nhoarseness of the throat, the heat also and sharpness of urine, and\r\nall the pains of the back or reins, and bladder. It is good also for\r\nthe liver and the jaundice, and all hot agues, to cool the heat, and\r\nquench the thirst; but the syrup of Violets is of most use, and of\r\nbetter effect, being taken in some convenient liquor: and if a little\r\nof the juice or syrup of lemons be put to it, or a few drops of the\r\noil of vitriol, it is made thereby the more powerful to cool the heat,\r\nand quench the thirst, and gives to the drink a claret wine colour,\r\nand a fine tart relish, pleasing to the taste. Violets taken, or made\r\nup with honey, do more cleanse and cool, and with sugar contrary-wise.\r\nThe dried flower of Violets are accounted amongst the cordial drinks,\r\npowders, and other medicines, especially where cooling cordials are\r\nnecessary. The green leaves are used with other herbs to make plaisters\r\nand poultices to inflammations and swellings, and to ease all pains\r\nwhatsoever, arising of heat, and for the piles also, being fried with\r\nyolks of eggs, and applied thereto.\r\n\r\n\r\n    VIPER’S BUGLOSS.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] THIS hath many long rough leaves lying on the ground,\r\nfrom among which rises up divers hard round stalks, very rough, as if\r\nthey were thick set with prickles or hairs, whereon are set such like\r\nrough, hairy, or prickly sad green leaves, somewhat narrow; the middle\r\nrib for the most part being white. The flowers stand at the top of the\r\nstalk, branched forth in many long spiked leaves of flowers bowing or\r\nturning like the turnsole, all opening for the most part on the one\r\nside, which are long and hollow, turning up the brims a little, of a\r\npurplish violet colour in them that are fully blown, but more reddish\r\nwhile they are in the bud, as also upon their decay and withering; but\r\nin some places of a paler purplish colour, with a long pointel in the\r\nmiddle, feathered or parted at the top. After the flowers are fallen,\r\nthe seeds growing to be ripe, are blackish, cornered and pointed\r\nsomewhat like the head of a viper. The root is somewhat great and\r\nblackish, and woolly, when it grows toward seed-time, and perishes in\r\nthe Winter.\r\n\r\nThere is another sort, little differing from the former, only in this,\r\nthat it bears white flowers.\r\n\r\n_Place._] The first grows wild almost every where. That with white\r\nflowers about the castle-walls at Lewis in Sussex.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in Summer, and their seed is ripe quickly after.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a most gallant herb of the Sun; it\r\nis a pity it is no more in use than it is. It is an especial remedy\r\nagainst the biting of the Viper, and all other venomous beasts, or\r\nserpents; as also against poison, or poisonous herbs. Dioscorides and\r\nothers say, That whosoever shall take of the herb or root before they\r\nbe bitten, shall not be hurt by the poison of any serpent. The root or\r\nseed is thought to be most effectual to comfort the heart, and expel\r\nsadness, or causeless melancholy; it tempers the blood, and allays\r\nhot fits of agues. The seed drank in wine, procures abundance of milk\r\nin women’s breasts. The same also being taken, eases the pains in the\r\nloins, back, and kidneys. The distilled water of the herb when it is\r\nin flower, or its chief strength, is excellent to be applied either\r\ninwardly or outwardly, for all the griefs aforesaid. There is a syrup\r\nmade hereof very effectual for the comforting the heart, and expelling\r\nsadness and melancholy.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WALL FLOWERS, OR WINTER GILLI-FLOWERS.\r\n\r\nTHE garden kind are so well known that they need no description.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The common single Wall-flowers, which grow wild abroad,\r\nhave sundry small, long, narrow, dark green leaves, set without order\r\nupon small round, whitish, woody stalks, which bear at the tops divers\r\nsingle yellow flowers one above another, every one bearing four leaves\r\na-piece, and of a very sweet scent: after which come long pods,\r\ncontaining a reddish seed. The roots are white, hard and thready.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows upon church walls, and old walls of many houses, and\r\nother stone walls in divers places; The other sort in gardens only.\r\n\r\n_Time._] All the single kinds do flower many times in the end of\r\nAutumn; and if the Winter be mild, all the Winter long, but especially\r\nin the months of February, March, and April, and until the heat of\r\nthe spring do spend them. But the double kinds continue not flowering\r\nin that manner all the year long, although they flower very early\r\nsometimes, and in some places very late.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The Moon rules them. Galen, in his seventh\r\nbook of simple medicines, saith, That the yellow Wall-flowers work more\r\npowerfully than any of the other kinds, and are therefore of more use\r\nin physic. It cleanses the blood, and fretteth the liver and reins from\r\nobstructions, provokes women’s courses, expels the secundine, and the\r\ndead child; helps the hardness and pain of the mother, and of spleen\r\nalso; stays inflammations and swellings, comforts and strengthens any\r\nweak part, or out of joint; helps to cleanse the eyes from mistiness or\r\nfilms upon them, and to cleanse the filthy ulcers in the mouth, or any\r\nother part, and is a singular remedy for the gout, and all aches and\r\npains in the joints and sinews. A conserve made of the flowers, is used\r\nfor a remedy both for the apoplexy and palsy.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE WALLNUT TREE.\r\n\r\nIT is so well known, that it needs no description.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It blossoms early before the leaves come forth, and the fruit\r\nis ripe in September.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] This is also a plant of the Sun. Let the\r\nfruit of it be gathered accordingly, which you shall find to be of most\r\nvirtues while they are green, before they have shells. The bark of\r\nthe Tree doth bind and dry very much, and the leaves are much of the\r\nsame temperature: but the leaves when they are older, are heating and\r\ndrying in the second degree, and harder of digestion than when they\r\nare fresh, which, by reason of their sweetness, are more pleasing,\r\nand better digesting in the stomach; and taken with sweet wine, they\r\nmove the belly downwards, but being old, they grieve the stomach; and\r\nin hot bodies cause the choler to abound and the head-ach, and are an\r\nenemy to those that have the cough; but are less hurtful to those that\r\nhave a colder stomach, and are said to kill the broad worms in the\r\nbelly or stomach. If they be taken with onions, salt, and honey, they\r\nhelp the biting of a mad dog, or the venom or infectious poison of any\r\nbeast, &c. Caias Pompeius found in the treasury of Mithridates, king\r\nof Pontus, when he was overthrown, a scroll of his own hand writing,\r\ncontaining a medicine against any poison or infection; which is this;\r\nTake two dry walnuts, and as many good figs, and twenty leaves of\r\nrue, bruised and beaten together with two or three corns of salt and\r\ntwenty juniper berries, which take every morning fasting, preserves\r\nfrom danger of poison, and infection that day it is taken. The juice\r\nof the other green husks boiled with honey is an excellent gargle for\r\nsore mouths, or the heat and inflammations in the throat and stomach.\r\nThe kernels, when they grow old, are more oily, and therefore not\r\nfit to be eaten, but are then used to heal the wounds of the sinews,\r\ngangrenes, and carbuncles. The said kernels being burned, are very\r\nastringent, and will stay lasks and women’s courses, being taken in\r\nred wine, and stay the falling of the hair, and make it fair, being\r\nanointed with oil and wine. The green husks will do the like, being\r\nused in the same manner. The kernels beaten with rue and wine, being\r\napplied, help the quinsy; and bruised with some honey, and applied to\r\nthe ears, ease the pains and inflammation of them. A piece of the green\r\nhusks put into a hollow tooth, eases the pain. The catkins hereof,\r\ntaken before they fall off, dried, and given a dram thereof in powder\r\nwith white wine, wonderfully helps those that are troubled with the\r\nrising of the mother. The oil that is pressed out of the kernels,\r\nis very profitable, taken inwardly like oil of almonds, to help the\r\ncholic, and to expel wind very effectually; an ounce or two thereof may\r\nbe taken at any time. The young green nuts taken before they be half\r\nripe, and preserved with sugar, are of good use for those that have\r\nweak stomachs, or defluctions thereon. The distilled water of the green\r\nhusks, before they be half ripe, is of excellent use to cool the heat\r\nof agues, being drank an ounce or two at a time: as also to resist the\r\ninfection of the plague, if some of the same be also applied to the\r\nsores thereof. The same also cools the heat of green wounds and old\r\nulcers, and heals them, being bathed therewith. The distilled water of\r\nthe green husks being ripe, when they are shelled from the nuts, and\r\ndrank with a little vinegar, is good for the place, so as before the\r\ntaking thereof a vein be opened. The said water is very good against\r\nthe quinsy, being gargled and bathed therewith, and wonderfully helps\r\ndeafness, the noise, and other pains in the ears. The distilled water\r\nof the young green leaves in the end of May, performs a singular cure\r\non foul running ulcers and sores, to be bathed, with wet cloths or\r\nspunges applied to them every morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WOLD, WELD, OR DYER’S WEED.\r\n\r\nTHE common kind grows bushing with many leaves, long, narrow and\r\nflat upon the ground; of a dark blueish green colour, somewhat like\r\nunto Woad, but nothing so large, a little crumpled, and as it were\r\nround-pointed, which do so abide the first year; and the next spring\r\nfrom among them, rise up divers round stalks, two or three feet high,\r\nbeset with many such like leaves thereon, but smaller, and shooting\r\nforth small branches, which with the stalks carry many small yellow\r\nflowers, in a long spiked head at the top of them, where afterwards\r\ncome the seed, which is small and black, inclosed in heads that are\r\ndivided at the tops into four parts. The root is long, white and thick,\r\nabiding the Winter. The whole herb changes to be yellow, after it hath\r\nbeen in flower awhile.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows every where by the way sides, in moist grounds, as\r\nwell as dry, in corners of fields and bye lanes, and sometimes all over\r\nthe field. In Sussex and Kent they call it Green Weed.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in June.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Matthiolus saith, that the root hereof cures\r\ntough phlegm, digests raw phlegm, thins gross humours, dissolves hard\r\ntumours, and opens obstructions. Some do highly commend it against\r\nthe biting of venomous creatures, to be taken inwardly and applied\r\noutwardly to the hurt place; as also for the plague or pestilence. The\r\npeople in some countries of this land, do use to bruise the herb, and\r\nlay it to cuts or wounds in the hands or legs, to heal them.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WHEAT.\r\n\r\nALL the several kinds thereof are so well known unto almost all people,\r\nthat it is all together needless to write a description thereof.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under Venus. Dioscorides saith, That\r\nto eat the corn of green Wheat is hurtful to the stomach, and breeds\r\nworms. Pliny saith, That the corn of Wheat, roasted upon an iron pan,\r\nand eaten, are a present remedy for those that are chilled with cold.\r\nThe oil pressed from wheat, between two thick plates of iron, or copper\r\nheated, heals all tetters and ring-worms, being used warm; and hereby\r\nGalen saith, he hath known many to be cured. Matthiolus commends the\r\nsame to be put into hollow ulcers to heal them up, and it is good for\r\nchops in the hands and feet, and to make rugged skin smooth. The green\r\ncorns of Wheat being chewed, and applied to the place bitten by a mad\r\ndog, heals it; slices of Wheat bread soaked in red rose water, and\r\napplied to the eyes that are hot, red, and inflamed, or blood-shotten,\r\nhelps them. Hot bread applied for an hour, at times, for three days\r\ntogether, perfectly heals the kernels in the throat, commonly called\r\nthe king’s evil. The flour of Wheat mixed with the juice of henbane,\r\nstays the flux of humours to the joints, being laid thereon. The said\r\nmeal boiled in vinegar, helps the shrinking of the sinews, saith Pliny;\r\nand mixed with vinegar, and boiled together, heals all freckles, spots\r\nand pimples on the face. Wheat flour, mixed with the yolk of an egg,\r\nhoney, and turpentine, doth draw, cleanse and heal any boil, plague,\r\nsore, or foul ulcer. The bran of Wheat meal steeped in sharp vinegar,\r\nand then bound in a linen cloth, and rubbed on those places that have\r\nthe scurf, morphew, scabs or leprosy, will take them away, the body\r\nbeing first well purged and prepared. The decoction of the bran of\r\nWheat or barley, is of good use to bathe those places that are bursten\r\nby a rupture; and the said bran boiled in good vinegar, and applied\r\nto swollen breasts, helps them, and stays all inflamations. It helps\r\nalso the biting of vipers (which I take to be no other than our English\r\nadder) and all other venomous creatures. The leaves of Wheat meal\r\napplied with some salt, take away hardness of the skin, warts, and hard\r\nknots in the flesh. Wafers put in water, and drank, stays the lask\r\nand bloody flux, and are profitably used both inwardly and outwardly\r\nfor the ruptures in children. Boiled in water unto a thick jelly, and\r\ntaken, it stays spitting of blood; and boiled with mint and butter, it\r\nhelps the hoarseness of the throat.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE WILLOW TREE.\r\n\r\nTHESE are so well known that they need no description. I shall\r\ntherefore only shew you the virtues therof.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] The Moon owns it. Both the leaves, bark,\r\nand the seed, are used to stanch bleeding of wounds, and at mouth and\r\nnose, spitting of blood, and other fluxes of blood in man or woman,\r\nand to stay vomiting, and provocation thereunto, if the decoction of\r\nthem in wine be drank. It helps also to stay thin, hot, sharp, salt\r\ndistillations from the head upon the lungs, causing a consumption. The\r\nleaves bruised with some pepper, and drank in wine, helps much the wind\r\ncholic. The leaves bruised and boiled in wine, and drank, stays the\r\nheat of lust in man or woman, and quite extinguishes it, if it be long\r\nused: The seed also is of the same effect. Water that is gathered from\r\nthe Willow, when it flowers, the bark being slit, and a vessel fitting\r\nto receive it, is very good for redness and dimness of sight, or films\r\nthat grow over the eyes, and stay the rheums that fall into them; to\r\nprovoke urine, being stopped, if it be drank; to clear the face and\r\nskin from spots and discolourings. Galen saith, The flowers have an\r\nadmirable faculty in drying up humours, being a medicine without any\r\nsharpness or corrosion; you may boil them in white wine, and drink as\r\nmuch as you will, so you drink not yourself drunk. The bark works the\r\nsame effect, if used in the same manner, and the Tree hath always a\r\nbark upon it, though not always flowers; the burnt ashes of the bark\r\nbeing mixed with vinegar, takes away warts, corns, and superfluous\r\nflesh, being applied to the place. The decoction of the leaves or bark\r\nin wine, takes away scurff and dandriff by washing the place with it.\r\nIt is a fine cool tree, the boughs of which are very convenient to be\r\nplaced in the chamber of one sick of a fever.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WOAD.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] IT hath divers large leaves, long, and somewhat broad\r\nwithal, like those of the greater plantain, but larger, thicker, of a\r\ngreenish colour, somewhat blue withal. From among which leaves rises up\r\na lusty stalk, three or four feet high, with divers leaves set thereon;\r\nthe higher the stalk rises, the smaller are the leaves; at the top it\r\nspreads divers branches, at the end of which appear very pretty, little\r\nyellow flowers, and after they pass away like other flowers of the\r\nfield, come husks, long and somewhat flat withal; in form they resemble\r\na tongue, in colour they are black, and they hang bobbing downwards.\r\nThe seed contained within these husks (if it be a little chewed) gives\r\nan azure colour. The root is white and long.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It is sowed in fields for the benefit of it, where those\r\nthat sow it, cut it three times a year.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers in June, but it is long after before the seed is\r\nripe.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is a cold and dry plant of Saturn. Some\r\npeople affirm the plant to be destructive to bees, and fluxes them,\r\nwhich, if it be, I cannot help it. I should rather think, unless bees\r\nbe contrary to other creatures, it possesses them with the contrary\r\ndisease, the herb being exceeding dry and binding. However, if any bees\r\nbe diseased thereby, the cure is, to set urine by them, but set it in\r\na vessel, that they cannot drown themselves, which may be remedied, if\r\nyou put pieces of cork in it. The herb is so drying and binding, that\r\nit is not fit to be given inwardly. An ointment made thereof stanches\r\nbleeding. A plaister made thereof, and applied to the region of the\r\nspleen which lies on the left side, takes away the hardness and pains\r\nthereof. The ointment is excellently good in such ulcers as abound with\r\nmoisture, and takes away the corroding and fretting humours: It cools\r\ninflammations, quenches St. Anthony’s fire, and stays defluxion of the\r\nblood to any part of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WOODBINE, OR HONEY-SUCKLES.\r\n\r\nIT is a plant so common, that every one that hath eyes knows it, and he\r\nthat hath none, cannot read a description, if I should write it.\r\n\r\n_Time._] They flower in June, and the fruit is ripe in August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Doctor Tradition, that grand introducer of\r\nerrors, that hater of truth, lover of folly, and the mortal foe to Dr.\r\nReason, hath taught the common people to use the leaves or flowers of\r\nthis plant in mouth-water, and by long continuance of time, hath so\r\ngrounded it in the brains of the vulgar, that you cannot beat it out\r\nwith a beetle: All mouth-waters ought to be cooling and drying, but\r\nHoney Suckles are cleansing, consuming and digesting, and therefore\r\nfit for inflammations; thus Dr. Reason. Again if you please, we will\r\nleave Dr. Reason a while, and come to Dr. Experience, a learned\r\ngentleman, and his brother. Take a leaf and chew it in your mouth, and\r\nyou will quickly find it likelier to cause a sore mouth and throat\r\nthan to cure it. Well then, if it be not good for this, What is it\r\ngood for? It is good for something, for God and nature made nothing in\r\nvain. It is an herb of Mercury, and appropriated to the lungs; Crab\r\nclaims dominion over it; neither is it a foe to the Lion; if the lungs\r\nbe afflicted by Jupiter, this is your cure: It is fitting a conserve\r\nmade of the flowers of it were kept in every gentlewoman’s house; I\r\nknow no better cure for an asthma than this: besides, it takes away\r\nthe evil of the spleen, provokes urine, procures speedy delivery\r\nof women in travail, helps cramps, convulsions, and palsies, and\r\nwhatsoever griefs come of cold or stopping; if you please to make use\r\nof it as an ointment, it will clear your skin of morphew, freckles,\r\nand sun-burnings, or whatsoever else discolours it, and then the maids\r\nwill love it. Authors say, The flowers are of more effect than the\r\nleaves, and that is true; but they say the seeds are least effectual\r\nof all. But Dr. Reason told me, That there was a vital spirit in every\r\nseed to beget its like; and Dr. Experience told me, That there was a\r\ngreater heat in the seed than there was in any other part of the plant;\r\nand withal, That heat was the mother of action, and then judge if old\r\nDr. Tradition (who may well be honoured for his age, but not for his\r\ngoodness) hath not so poisoned the world with errors before I was born,\r\nthat it was never well in its wits since, and there is a great fear it\r\nwill die mad.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WORMWOOD.\r\n\r\nTHREE Wormwoods are familiar with us; one I shall not describe, another\r\nI shall describe, and the third be critical at; and I care not greatly\r\nif I begin with the last first.\r\n\r\n_Sea Wormwood_ hath gotten as many names as virtues, (and perhaps one\r\nmore) Seriphian, Santomeon, Belchion, Narbinense, Hantonicon, Misneule,\r\nand a matter of twenty more which I shall not blot paper withal. A\r\npapist got the toy by the end, and he called it Holy Wormwood; and in\r\ntruth I am opinion, their giving so much holiness to herbs, is the\r\nreason there remains so little in themselves. The seed of this Wormwood\r\nis that which women usually give their children for the worms. Of all\r\nWormwoods that grow here, this is the weakest, but Doctors commend\r\nit, and apothecaries sell it; the one must keep his credit, and the\r\nother get money, and that is the key of the work. The herb is good for\r\nsomething, because God made nothing in vain: Will you give me leave\r\nto weigh things in the balance of reason; Then thus: The seeds of\r\nthe common Wormwood are far more prevalent than the seed of this, to\r\nexpel worms in children, or people of ripe age; of both some are weak,\r\nsome are strong. The Seriphian Wormwood is the weakest, and haply may\r\nprove to be fittest for the weak bodies, (for it is weak enough of all\r\nconscience.) Let such as are strong take the common Wormwood, for the\r\nothers will do but little good. Again, near the sea many people live,\r\nand Seriphian grows near them, and therefore is more fitting for their\r\nbodies, because nourished by the same air; and this I had from Dr.\r\nReason. In whose body Dr. Reason dwells not, dwells Dr. Madness, and\r\nhe brings in his brethren, Dr. Ignorance, Dr. Folly, and Dr. Sickness,\r\nand these together make way for Death, and the latter end of that man\r\nis worse than the beginning. Pride was the cause of Adam’s fall; pride\r\nbegat a daughter, I do not know the father of it, unless the devil,\r\nbut she christened it, and called it Appetite, and sent her daughter\r\nto taste these wormwoods, who finding this the least bitter, made the\r\nsqueamish wench extol it to the skies, though the virtues of it never\r\nreached the middle region of the air. Its due praise is this; It is\r\nweakest, therefore fittest for weak bodies, and fitter for those bodies\r\nthat dwell near it, than those that dwell far from it; my reason is,\r\nthe sea (those that live far from it, know when they come near it)\r\ncasts not such a smell as the land doth. The tender mercies of God\r\nbeing over all his works, hath by his eternal Providence, planted\r\nSeriphian by the seaside, as a fit medicine for the bodies of those\r\nthat live near it. Lastly, It is known to all that know any thing in\r\nthe course of nature, that the liver delights in sweet things, if\r\nso, it abhors bitter; then if your liver be weak, it is none of the\r\nwisest courses to plague it with an enemy. If the liver be weak, a\r\nconsumption follows; would you know the reason? It is this, A man’s\r\nflesh is repaired by blood, by a third concoction, which transmutes the\r\nblood into flesh, it is well I said, (concoction) say I, if I had said\r\n(boiling) every cook would have understood me. The liver makes blood,\r\nand if it be weakened that if it makes not enough, the flesh wastes;\r\nand why must flesh always be renewed? Because the eternal God, when he\r\nmade the creation, made one part of it in continual dependency upon\r\nanother; and why did he so? Because himself only is permanent; to teach\r\nus, That we should not fix our affections upon what is transitory, but\r\nwhat endures for ever. The result of this is, if the liver be weak, and\r\ncannot make blood enough, I would have said, Sanguify, if I had written\r\nonly to scholars, the Seriphian, which is the weakest of Wormwoods, is\r\nbetter than the best. I have been critical enough, if not too much.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows familiarly in England, by the sea-side.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] It starts up out of the earth, with many round, woody,\r\nhairy stalks from one root. Its height is four feet, or three at least.\r\nThe leaves in longitude are long, in latitude narrow, in colour white,\r\nin form hoary, in similitude like Southernwood, only broader and\r\nlonger; in taste rather salt than bitter, because it grows so near the\r\nsalt-water; at the joints, with the leaves toward the tops it bears\r\nlittle yellow flowers; the root lies deep, and is woody.\r\n\r\n_Common Wormwood_ I shall not describe, for every boy that can eat an\r\negg knows it.\r\n\r\n_Roman Wormwood_; and why Roman, seeing it grows familiarly in England?\r\nIt may be so called, because it is good for a stinking breath, which\r\nthe Romans cannot be very free from, maintaining so many bad houses by\r\nauthority of his Holiness.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] The stalks are slender, and shorter than the common\r\nWormwood by one foot at least; the leaves are more finely cut and\r\ndivided than they are, but something smaller; both leaves and stalks\r\nare hoary, the flowers of a pale yellow colour; it is altogether like\r\nthe common Wormwood, save only in bigness, for it is smaller; in taste,\r\nfor it is not so bitter; in smell, for it is spicy.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It grows upon the tops of the mountains (it seems ’tis\r\naspiring) there ’tis natural, but usually nursed up in gardens for the\r\nuse of the apothecaries in London.\r\n\r\n_Time._] All Wormwoods usually flower in August, a little sooner or\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] Will you give me leave to be critical a\r\nlittle? I must take leave. Wormwood is an herb of Mars, and if Pontanus\r\nsay otherwise, he is beside the bridge; I prove it thus: What delights\r\nin martial places, is a martial herb; but Wormwood delights in martial\r\nplaces (for about forges and iron works you may gather a cart-load\r\nof it,) _ergo_, it is a martial herb. It is hot and dry in the first\r\ndegree, viz. just as hot as your blood, and no hotter. It remedies the\r\nevils choler can inflict on the body of man by sympathy. It helps\r\nthe evils Venus and the wanton Boy produce, by antipathy; and it doth\r\nsomething else besides. It cleanses the body of choler (who dares say\r\nMars doth no good?) It provokes urine, helps surfeits, or swellings\r\nin the belly; it causes appetite to meat, because Mars rules the\r\nattractive faculty in man: The sun never shone upon a better herb for\r\nthe yellow jaundice than this; Why should men cry out so much upon\r\nMars for an infortunate, (or Saturn either?) Did God make creatures to\r\ndo the creation a mischief? This herb testifies, that Mars is willing\r\nto cure all diseases he causes; the truth is, Mars loves no cowards,\r\nnor Saturn fools, nor I neither. Take of the flowers of Wormwood,\r\nRosemary, and Black Thorn, of each a like quantity, half that quantity\r\nof saffron; boil this in Rhenish wine, but put it not in saffron till\r\nit is almost boiled; This is the way to keep a man’s body in health,\r\nappointed by Camerarius, in his book intitled _Hortus Medicus_, and\r\nit is a good one too. Besides all this, Wormwood provokes the terms.\r\nI would willingly teach astrologers, and make them physicians (if I\r\nknew how) for they are most fitting for the calling; if you will not\r\nbelieve me, ask Dr. Hippocrates, and Dr. Galen, a couple of gentlemen\r\nthat our college of physicians keep to vapour with, not to follow. In\r\nthis our herb, I shall give the pattern of a ruler, the sons of art\r\nrough cast, yet as near the truth as the men of Benjamin could throw\r\na stone: Whereby, my brethren, the astrologers may know by a penny\r\nhow a shilling is coined: As for the college of physicians, they are\r\ntoo stately to college or too proud to continue. They say a mouse is\r\nunder the dominion of the Moon, and that is the reason they feed in the\r\nnight; the house of the Moon is Cancer; rats are of the same nature\r\nwith mice, but they are a little bigger; Mars receives his fall in\r\nCancer, _ergo_, Wormwood being an herb of Mars, is a present remedy\r\nfor the biting of rats and mice. Mushrooms (I cannot give them the\r\ntitle of Herba, Frutex, or Arbor) are under the dominion of Saturn,\r\n(and take one time with another, they do as much harm as good;) if any\r\nhave poisoned himself by eating them, Wormwood, an herb of Mars, cures\r\nhim, because Mars is exalted in Capricorn, the house of Saturn, and\r\nthis it doth by sympathy, as it did the other by antipathy. Wheals,\r\npushes, black and blue spots, coming either by bruises or beatings.\r\nWormwood, an herb of Mars, helps, because Mars, (as bad you love him,\r\nand as you hate him) will not break your head, but he will give you\r\na plaister. If he do but teach you to know yourselves, his courtesy\r\nis greater than his discourtesy. The greatest antipathy between the\r\nplanets, is between Mars and Venus: one is hot, the other cold; one\r\ndiurnal, the other nocturnal; one dry, the other moist; their houses\r\nare opposite, one masculine, the other feminine; one public, the other\r\nprivate; one is valiant, the other effeminate; one loves the light, the\r\nother hates it; one loves the field, the other sheets; then the throat\r\nis under Venus, the quinsy lies in the throat, and is an inflammation\r\nthere; Venus rules the throat, (it being under Taurus her sign.) Mars\r\neradicates all diseases in the throat by his herbs (for wormwood is\r\none) and sends them to Egypt on an errand never to return more, this\r\ndone by antipathy. The eyes are under the Luminaries; the right eye of\r\na man, and the left eye of a woman the Sun claims dominion over: the\r\nleft eye of a man, and the right eye of a woman, are privileges of the\r\nMoon, Wormwood, an herb of Mars cures both; what belongs to the Sun\r\nby sympathy, because he is exalted in his house; but what belongs to\r\nthe Moon by antipathy, because he hath his fall in hers. Suppose a man\r\nbe bitten or stung by a martial creature, imagine a wasp, a hornet,\r\na scorpion, Wormwood, an herb of Mars, gives you a present cure; that\r\nMars, choleric as he is, hath learned that patience, to pass by your\r\nevil speeches of him, and tells you by my pen, That he gives you no\r\naffliction, but he gives you a cure; you need not run to Apollo, nor\r\nÆsculapius; and if he was so choleric as you make him to be, he would\r\nhave drawn his sword for anger, to see the ill conditions of these\r\npeople that can spy his vices, and not his virtues. The eternal God,\r\nwhen he made Mars, made him for public good, and the sons of men shall\r\nknow it in the latter end of the world. _Et cælum Mars solus babet._\r\nYou say Mars is a destroyer; mix a little Wormwood, an herb of Mars,\r\nwith your ink, neither rats nor mice touch the paper written with it,\r\nand then Mars is a preserver. Astrologers think Mars causes scabs and\r\nitch, and the virgins are angry with him, because wanton Venus told\r\nthem he deforms their skins; but, quoth Mars, my only desire is, they\r\nshould know themselves; my herb Wormwood will restore them to the\r\nbeauty they formerly had, and in that I will not come an inch behind my\r\nopposite, Venus: for which doth the greatest evil, he that takes away\r\nan innate beauty, and when he has done, knows how to restore it again?\r\nor she that teaches a company of wanton lasses to paint their faces?\r\nIf Mars be in a Virgin, in the nativity, they say he causes the cholic\r\n(it is well God hath set some body to pull down the pride of man.) He\r\nin the Virgin troubles none with the cholic, but them that know not\r\nthemselves (for who knows himself, may easily know all the world.)\r\nWormwood, an herb of Mars, is a present cure for it; and whether it be\r\nmost like a Christian to love him for his good, or hate him for his\r\nevil, judge ye. I had almost forgotten, that charity thinks no evil. I\r\nwas once in the Tower and viewed the wardrobe, and there was a great\r\nmany fine clothes: (I can give them no other title, for I was never\r\neither linen or woolen draper) yet as brave as they looked, my opinion\r\nwas that the moths might consume them; moths are under the dominion of\r\nMars; this herb Wormwood being laid among cloaths, will make a moth\r\nscorn to meddle with the cloaths, as much as a lion scorns to meddle\r\nwith a mouse, or an eagle with a fly. You say Mars is angry, and it is\r\ntrue enough he is angry with many countrymen, for being such fools to\r\nbe led by the noses by the college of physicians, as they lead bears to\r\nParis garden. Melancholy men cannot endure to be wronged in point of\r\ngood fame, and that doth sorely trouble old Saturn, because they call\r\nhim the greatest infortunate; in the body of man he rules the spleen,\r\n(and that makes covetous man so splenetic) the poor old man lies crying\r\nout of his left side. Father Saturn’s angry, Mars comes to him; Come,\r\nbrother, I confess thou art evil spoken of, and so am I; thou knowest I\r\nhave my exaltation in thy house, I give him an herb of mine, Wormwood,\r\nto cure the old man: Saturn consented, but spoke little, and so Mars\r\ncured him by sympathy. When Mars was free from war, (for he loves to\r\nbe fighting, and is the best friend a soldier hath) I say, when Mars\r\nwas free from war, he called a council of war in his own brain, to know\r\nhow he should do poor sinful man good, desiring to forget his abuses in\r\nbeing called an infortunate. He musters up his own forces, and places\r\nthem in battalia. Oh! quoth he, why do I hurt a poor silly man or\r\nwoman? His angel answers him, It is because they have offended their\r\nGod, (Look back to Adam:) Well, says Mars, though they speak evil of\r\nme, I will do good to them; Death’s cold, my herb shall heat them: they\r\nare full of ill humours (else they would never have spoken ill of me;)\r\nmy herb shall cleanse them, and dry them; they are poor weak creatures,\r\nmy herb shall strengthen them; they are dull witted, my herb shall\r\nfortify their apprehensions; and yet among astrologers all this does\r\nnot deserve a good word: Oh the patience of Mars!\r\n\r\n   _Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere caucas,\r\n    Inque domus superum scandere cura facit._\r\n    O happy he that can the knowledge gain,\r\n    To know the eternal God made nought in vain.\r\n\r\n    To this I add,\r\n\r\n    I know the reason causeth such a dearth\r\n    Of knowledge; ’tis because men love the earth.\r\n\r\nThe other day Mars told me he met with Venus, and he asked her, What\r\nwas the reason that she accused him for abusing women? He never gave\r\nthem the pox. In the dispute they fell out, and in anger parted, and\r\nMars told me that his brother Saturn told him, that an antivenerean\r\nmedicine was the best against the pox. Once a month he meets with the\r\nMoon. Mars is quick enough of speech, and the Moon not much behind\r\nhand, (neither are most women.) The Moon looks much after children, and\r\nchildren are much troubled with the worms; she desired a medicine of\r\nhim, he bid her take his own herb, Wormwood. He had no sooner parted\r\nwith the Moon, but he met with Venus, and she was as drunk as a hog;\r\nAlas! poor Venus, quoth he; What! thou a fortune, and be drunk? I’ll\r\ngive thee antipathetical cure; Take my herb Wormwood, and thou shall\r\nnever get a surfeit by drinking. A poor silly countryman hath got an\r\nague, and cannot go about his business: he wishes he had it not, and\r\nso do I; but I will tell him a remedy, whereby he shall prevent it;\r\nTake the herb of Mars, Wormwood, and if infortunes will do good, what\r\nwill fortunes do? Some think the lungs are under Jupiter; and if the\r\nlungs then the breath; and though sometimes a man gets a stinking\r\nbreath, and yet Jupiter is a fortune, forsooth; up comes Mars to him;\r\nCome brother Jupiter, thou knowest I sent thee a couple of trines to\r\nthy house last night, the one from Aries, and the other from Scorpio;\r\ngive me thy leave by sympathy to cure this poor man with drinking a\r\ndraught of Wormwood beer every morning. The Moon was weak the other\r\nday, and she gave a man two terrible mischiefs, a dull brain and a weak\r\nsight; Mars laid by his sword, and comes to her; Sister Moon, said\r\nhe, this man hath angered thee, but I beseech thee take notice he is\r\nbut a fool; prithee be patient, I will with my herb wormwood cure him\r\nof both infirmities by antipathy, for thou knowest thou and I cannot\r\nagree; with that the Moon began to quarrel; Mars (not delighting much\r\nin women’s tongues) went away, and did it whether she would or no.\r\n\r\nHe that reads this, and understands what he reads, hath a jewel of more\r\nworth than a diamond; he that understands it not, is as little fit to\r\ngive physick. There lies a key in these words which will unlock, (if it\r\nbe turned by a wise hand) the cabinet of physick: I have delivered it\r\nas plain as I durst; it is not only upon Wormwood as I wrote, but upon\r\nall plants, trees, and herbs; he that understands it not, is unfit (in\r\nmy opinion) to give physic. This shall live when I am dead. And thus\r\nI leave it to the world, not caring a farthing whether they like it\r\nor dislike it. The grave equals all men, and therefore shall equal me\r\nwith all princes; until which time the eternal Providence is over me:\r\nThen the ill tongue of a prating fellow, or one that hath more tongue\r\nthan wit, or more proud than honest, shall never trouble me. _Wisdom is\r\njustified by her children._ And so much for Wormwood.\r\n\r\n\r\n    YARROW, CALLED NOSE-BLEED, MILFOIL\r\n    AND THOUSAND-LEAL.\r\n\r\n_Descript._] IT hath many long leaves spread upon the ground, finely\r\ncut, and divided into many small parts. Its flowers are white, but not\r\nall of a whiteness and stayed in knots, upon divers green stalks which\r\nrise from among the leaves.\r\n\r\n_Place._] It is frequent in all pastures.\r\n\r\n_Time._] It flowers late, even in the latter end of August.\r\n\r\n_Government and virtues._] It is under the influence of Venus. An\r\nointment of them cures wounds, and is most fit for such as have\r\ninflammations, it being an herb of Dame Venus; it stops the terms in\r\nwomen, being boiled in white wine, and the decoction drank; as also the\r\nbloody flux; the ointment of it is not only good for green wounds, but\r\nalso for ulcers and fistulas, especially such as abound with moisture.\r\nIt stays the shedding of hair, the head being bathed with the decoction\r\nof it; inwardly taken it helps the retentive faculty of the stomach: it\r\nhelps the gonorrhea in men, and the whites in women, and helps such as\r\ncannot hold their water; and the leaves chewed in the mouth eases the\r\ntooth-ache, and these virtues being put together, shew the herb to be\r\ndrying and binding. Achilles is supposed to be the first that left the\r\nvirtues of this herb to posterity, having learned them of this master\r\nChiron, the Centaur; and certainly a very profitable herb it is in\r\ncramps, and therefore called Militaris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR MAKING SYRUPS, CONSERVES,\r\n\r\n_&c._ _&c._\r\n\r\n\r\nHAVING in divers places of this Treatise promised you the way of making\r\nSyrups, Conserves, Oils, Ointments, &c., of herbs, roots, flowers, &c.\r\nwhereby you may have them ready for your use at such times when they\r\ncannot be had otherwise; I come now to perform what I promised, and you\r\nshall find me rather better than worse than my word.\r\n\r\nThat this may be done methodically, I shall divide my directions into\r\ntwo grand sections, and each section into several chapters, and then\r\nyou shall see it look with such a countenance as this is.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.\r\n\r\n_Of gathering, drying, and keeping Simples, and their juices._\r\n\r\n    CHAP. I.    _Of leaves of Herbs, &c._\r\n    CHAP. II.   _Of Flowers._\r\n    CHAP. III.  _Of Seeds._\r\n    CHAP. IV.   _Of Roots._\r\n    CHAP. V.    _Of Barks._\r\n    CHAP.

XV.   _The way of fitting Medicines to Compound Diseases._\r\n\r\n    Of all these in order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n_Of Leaves of Herbs, or Trees._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. OF leaves, choose only such as are green, and full of juice; pick\r\nthem carefully, and cast away such as are any way declining, for they\r\nwill putrify the rest: So shall one handful be worth ten of those you\r\nbuy at the physic herb shops.\r\n\r\n2. Note what places they most delight to grow in, and gather them\r\nthere; for Betony that grows in the shade, is far better than that\r\nwhich grows in the Sun, because it delights in the shade; so also such\r\nherbs as delight to grow near the water, shall be gathered near it,\r\nthough happily you may find some of them upon dry ground: The Treatise\r\nwill inform you where every herb delights to grow.\r\n\r\n3. The leaves of such herbs as run up to seed, are not so good when\r\nthey are in flower as before (some few excepted, the leaves of which\r\nare seldom or never used) in such cases, if through ignorance they were\r\nnot known, or through negligence forgotten, you had better take the top\r\nand the flowers, then the leaf.\r\n\r\n4. Dry them well in the Sun, and not in the shade, as the saying of\r\nphysicians is; for if the sun draw away the virtues of the herb, it\r\nmust need do the like by hay, by the same rule, which the experience of\r\nevery country farmer will explode for a notable piece of nonsense.\r\n\r\n5. Such as are artists in astrology, (and indeed none else are fit to\r\nmake physicians) such I advise; let the planet that governs the herb be\r\nangular, and the stronger the better; if they can, in herbs of Saturn,\r\nlet Saturn be in the ascendant; in the herbs of Mars, let Mars be in\r\nthe mid heaven, for in those houses they delight; let the Moon apply to\r\nthem by good aspect, and let her not be in the houses of her enemies;\r\nif you cannot well stay till she apply to them, let her apply to a\r\nplanet of the same triplicity; if you cannot wait that time neither,\r\nlet her be with a fixed star of their nature.\r\n\r\n6. Having well dried them, put them up in brown paper, sewing the paper\r\nup like a sack, and press them not too hard together, and keep them in\r\na dry place near the fire.\r\n\r\n7. As for the duration of dried herbs, a just time cannot be given, let\r\nauthors prate their pleasure; for,\r\n\r\n1st. Such as grow upon dry grounds will keep better than such as grow\r\non moist.\r\n\r\n2dly, Such herbs as are full of juice, will not keep so long as such as\r\nare drier.\r\n\r\n3dly. Such herbs as are well dried, will keep longer than such as are\r\nslack dried. Yet you may know when they are corrupted, by their loss of\r\ncolour, or smell, or both; and if they be corrupted, reason will tell\r\nyou that they must needs corrupt the bodies of those people that take\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n4. Gather all leaves in the hour of that planet that governs them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n_Of Flowers._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE flower, which is the beauty of the plant, and of none of the\r\nleast use in physick, grows yearly, and is to be gathered when it is in\r\nits prime.\r\n\r\n2. As for the time of gathering them, let the planetary hour, and the\r\nplanet they come of, be observed, as we shewed you in the foregoing\r\nchapter: as for the time of the day, let it be when the sun shine upon\r\nthem, that so they may be dry; for, if you gather either flowers or\r\nherbs when they are wet or dewy, they will not keep.\r\n\r\n3. Dry them well in the sun, and keep them in papers near the fire, as\r\nI shewed you in the foregoing chapter.\r\n\r\n4. So long as they retain the colour and smell, they are good; either\r\nof them being gone, so is the virtue also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n_Of Seeds._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE seed is that part of the plant which is endowed with a vital\r\nfaculty to bring forth its like, and it contains potentially the whole\r\nplant in it.\r\n\r\n2. As for place, let them be gathered from the place where they delight\r\nto grow.\r\n\r\n3. Let them be full ripe when they are gathered; and forget not the\r\ncelestial harmony before mentioned, for I have found by experience that\r\ntheir virtues are twice as great at such times as others: “There is an\r\nappointed time for every thing under the sun.”\r\n\r\n4. When you have gathered them, dry them a little, and but a little in\r\nthe sun, before you lay them up.\r\n\r\n5. You need not be so careful of keeping them so near the fire, as\r\nthe other before-mentioned, because they are fuller of spirit, and\r\ntherefore not so subject to corrupt.\r\n\r\n6. As for the time of their duration, it is palpable they will keep a\r\ngood many years; yet, they are best the first year, and this I make\r\nappear by a good argument. They will grow sooner the first year they be\r\nset, therefore then they are in their prime; and it is an easy matter\r\nto renew them yearly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n_Of Roots._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. OF roots, chuse such as are neither rotten nor worm-eaten, but\r\nproper in their taste, colour, and smell; such as exceed neither in\r\nsoftness nor hardness.\r\n\r\n2. Give me leave to be a little critical against the vulgar received\r\nopinion, which is, That the sap falls down into the roots in the\r\nAutumn, and rises again in the Spring, as men go to bed at night, and\r\nrise in the morning; and this idle talk of untruth is so grounded in\r\nthe heads, not only of the vulgar, but also of the learned, that a\r\nman cannot drive it out by reason. I pray let such sapmongers answer\r\nme this argument; If the sap falls into the roots in the fall of the\r\nleaf, and lies there all the Winter, then must the root grow only in\r\nthe Winter. But the root grows not at all in the Winter, as experience\r\nteaches, but only in the Summer: Therefore, If you set an apple-kernel\r\nin the Spring, you shall find the root to grow to a pretty bigness in\r\nthe Summer, and be not a whit bigger next Spring. What doth the sap do\r\nin the root all that while? Pick straws? ’Tis as rotten as a rotten\r\npost.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, when the sun declines from the tropic of Cancer, the sap\r\nbegins to congeal both in root and branch; when he touches the tropic\r\nof Capricorn, and ascends to us-ward, it begins to wax thin again, and\r\nby degrees, as it congealed. But to proceed.\r\n\r\n3. The drier time you gather the roots in, the better they are; for\r\nthey have the less excrementitious moisture in them.\r\n\r\n4. Such roots as are soft, your best way is to dry in the sun, or else\r\nhang them in the chimney corner upon a string; as for such as are hard,\r\nyou may dry them any where.\r\n\r\n5. Such roots as are great, will keep longer than such as are small;\r\nyet most of them will keep a year.\r\n\r\n6. Such roots as are soft, it is your best way to keep them always near\r\nthe fire, and to take this general rule for it: If in Winter-time you\r\nfind any of your roots, herbs or flowers begin to be moist, as many\r\ntimes you shall (for it is your best way to look to them once a month)\r\ndry them by a very gentle fire; or, if you can with convenience keep\r\nthem near the fire, you may save yourself the labour.\r\n\r\n7. It is in vain to dry roots that may commonly be had, as Parsley,\r\nFennel, Plantain, &c. but gather them only for present need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n_Of Barks._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. BARKS, which physicians use in medicine, are of these sorts: Of\r\nfruits, of roots, of boughs.\r\n\r\n2. The barks of fruits are to be taken when the fruit is full ripe,\r\nas Oranges, Lemons, &c. but because I have nothing to do with exotics\r\nhere, I pass them without any more words.\r\n\r\n3. The barks of trees are best gathered in the Spring, if of oaks, or\r\nsuch great trees; because then they come easier off, and so you may dry\r\nthem if you please; but indeed the best way is to gather all barks only\r\nfor present use.\r\n\r\n4. As for the barks of roots, ’tis thus to be gotten. Take the roots of\r\nsuch herbs as have a pith in them, as parsley, fennel, &c. slit them in\r\nthe middle, and when you have taken out the pith (which you may easily\r\ndo) that which remains is called (tho’ improperly) the bark, and indeed\r\nis only to be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n_Of Juices._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. JUICES are to be pressed out of herbs when they are young and\r\ntender, out of some stalks and tender tops of herbs and plants, and\r\nalso out of some flowers.\r\n\r\n2. Having gathered the herb, would you preserve the juice of it, when\r\nit is very dry (for otherwise the juice will not be worth a button)\r\nbruise it very well in a stone mortar with a wooden pestle, then having\r\nput it into a canvas bag, the herb I mean, not the mortar, for that\r\nwill give but little juice, press it hard in a press, then take the\r\njuice and clarify it.\r\n\r\n3. The manner of clarifying it is this: Put it into a pipkin or\r\nskillet, or some such thing, and set it over the fire; and when the\r\nscum arises, take it off; let it stand over the fire till no more scum\r\narise; when you have your juice clarified, cast away the scum as a\r\nthing of no use.\r\n\r\n4. When you have thus clarified it, you have two ways to preserve it\r\nall the year.\r\n\r\n(1.) When it is cold, put it into a glass, and put so much oil on it as\r\nwill cover it to the thickness of two fingers; the oil will swim at the\r\ntop, and so keep the air from coming to putrify it: When you intend to\r\nuse it, pour it into a porringer, and if any oil come out with it, you\r\nmay easily scum it off with a spoon, and put the juice you use not into\r\nthe glass again, it will quickly sink under the oil. This is the first\r\nway.\r\n\r\n(2.) The second way is a little more difficult, and the juice of fruits\r\nis usually preserved this way. When you have clarified it, boil it over\r\nthe fire, till (being cold) it be of the thickness of honey; This is\r\nmost commonly used for diseases of the mouth, and is called Roba and\r\nSaba. And thus much for the first section, the second follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\n_The way of making and keeping all necessary Compounds._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n_Of distilled Waters._\r\n\r\n\r\nHITHERTO we have spoken of medicines which consist in their own nature,\r\nwhich authors vulgarly call Simples, though sometimes improperly; for\r\nin truth, nothing is simple but pure elements; all things else are\r\ncompounded of them. We come now to treat of the artificial medicines,\r\nin the form of which (because we must begin somewhere) we shall place\r\ndistilled waters in which consider,\r\n\r\n1. Waters are distilled of herbs, flowers, fruits, and roots.\r\n\r\n2. We treat not of strong waters, but of cold, as being to act Galen’s\r\npart, and not Paracelsus’s.\r\n\r\n3. The herbs ought to be distilled when they are in the greatest\r\nvigour, and so ought the flowers also.\r\n\r\n4. The vulgar way of distillations which people use, because they know\r\nno better, is in a pewter still; and although distilled waters are the\r\nweakest of artificial medicines, and good for little but mixtures of\r\nother medicines, yet they are weaker by many degrees, than they would\r\nbe were they distilled in sand. If I thought it not impossible, to\r\nteach you the way of distilling in sand, I would attempt it.\r\n\r\n5. When you have distilled your water, put it into a glass, covered\r\nover with a paper pricked full of holes, so that the excrementitious\r\nand fiery vapours may exhale, which cause that settling in distilled\r\nwaters called the Mother, which corrupt them, then cover it close, and\r\nkeep it for your use.\r\n\r\n6. Stopping distilled waters with a cork, makes them musty, and so\r\ndoes paper, if it but touch the water: it is best to stop them with a\r\nbladder, being first put in water, and bound over the top of the glass.\r\n\r\nSuch cold waters as are distilled in a pewter still (if well kept) will\r\nendure a year; such as are distilled in sand, as they are twice as\r\nstrong, so they endure twice as long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n_Of Syrups._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A SYRUP is a medicine of a liquid form, composed of infusion,\r\ndecoction and juice. And, 1. For the more grateful taste. 2. For the\r\nbetter keeping of it: with a certain quantity of honey or sugar,\r\nhereafter mentioned, boiled to the thickness of new honey.\r\n\r\n2. You see at the first view, That this aphorism divides itself into\r\nthree branches, which deserve severally to be treated of, viz.\r\n\r\n    1. Syrups made by infusion.\r\n    2. Syrups made by decoction.\r\n    3. Syrups made by juice.\r\n\r\nOf each of these, (for your instruction-sake, kind countrymen and\r\nwomen) I speak a word or two apart.\r\n\r\n1st, Syrups made by infusion, are usually made of flowers, and of such\r\nflowers as soon lose their colour and strength by boiling, as roses,\r\nviolets, peach flowers, &c. They are thus made: Having picked your\r\nflowers clean, to every pound of them add three pounds or three pints,\r\nwhich you will (for it is all one) of spring water, made boiling hot;\r\nfirst put your flowers into a pewter-pot, with a cover, and pour the\r\nwater on them; then shutting the pot, let it stand by the fire, to\r\nkeep hot twelve hours, and strain it out: (in such syrups as purge), as\r\ndamask roses, peach flowers, &c. the usual, and indeed the best way, is\r\nto repeat this infusion, adding fresh flowers to the same liquor divers\r\ntimes, that so it may be the stronger) having strained it out, put the\r\ninfusion into a pewter bason, or an earthen one well glazed, and to\r\nevery pint of it add two pounds of sugar, which being only melted over\r\nthe fire, without boiling, and scummed, will produce you the syrup you\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\n2dly, Syrups made by decoction are usually made of compounds, yet may\r\nany simple herb be thus converted into syrup: Take the herb, root,\r\nor flowers you would make into a syrup, and bruise it a little; then\r\nboil it in a convenient quantity of spring water; the more water you\r\nboil it in, the weaker it will be; a handful of the herb or root is a\r\nconvenient quantity for a pint of water, boil it till half the water\r\nbe consumed, then let it stand till it be almost cold, and strain\r\nit through a woollen cloth, letting it run out at leisure: without\r\npressing. To every pint of this decoction add one pound of sugar, and\r\nboil it over the fire till it come to a syrup, which you may know, if\r\nyou now and then cool a little of it with a spoon: Scum it all the\r\nwhile it boils, and when it is sufficiently boiled, whilst it is hot,\r\nstrain it again through a woollen cloth, but press it not. Thus you\r\nhave the syrup perfected.\r\n\r\n3dly, Syrups made of juice, are usually made of such herbs as are full\r\nof juice, and indeed they are better made into a syrup this way than\r\nany other; the operation is thus: Having beaten the herb in a stone\r\nmortar, with a wooden pestle, press out the juice, and clarify it, as\r\nyou are taught before in the juices; then let the juice boil away till\r\nabout a quarter of it be consumed; to a pint of this add a pound of\r\nsugar, and when it is boiled, strain it through a woollen cloth, as we\r\ntaught you before, and keep it for your use.\r\n\r\n3. If you make a syrup of roots that are any thing hard, as parsley,\r\nfennel, and grass roots, &c. when you have bruised them, lay them in\r\nsteep some time in that water which you intend to boil them in hot, so\r\nwill the virtue the better come out.\r\n\r\n4. Keep your syrups either in glasses or stone pots, and stop them not\r\nwith cork nor bladder, unless you would have the glass break, and the\r\nsyrup lost, only bind paper about the mouth.\r\n\r\n5. All syrups, if well made, continue a year with some advantage; yet\r\nsuch as are made by infusion, keep shortest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n_Of Juleps._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. JULEPS were first invented, as I suppose, in Arabia; and my reason\r\nis, because the word Julep is an Arabic word.\r\n\r\n2. It signifies only a pleasant potion, as is vulgarly used by such as\r\nare sick, and want help, or such as are in health, and want no money\r\nto quench thirst.\r\n\r\n3. Now-a-day it is commonly used—\r\n\r\n    1. To prepare the body for purgation.\r\n    2. To open obstructions and the pores.\r\n    3. To digest tough humours.\r\n    4. To qualify hot distempers, &c.\r\n\r\n4. Simple Juleps, (for I have nothing to say to compounds here) are\r\nthus made; Take a pint of such distilled water, as conduces to the cure\r\nof your distemper, which this treatise will plentifully furnish you\r\nwith, to which add two ounces of syrup, conducing to the same effect;\r\n(I shall give you rules for it in the next chapter) mix them together,\r\nand drink a draught of it at your pleasure. If you love tart things,\r\nadd ten drops of oil of vitriol to your pint, and shake it together,\r\nand it will have a fine grateful taste.\r\n\r\n5. All juleps are made for present use; and therefore it is in vain to\r\nspeak of their duration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n_Of Decoctions._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ALL the difference between decoctions, and syrups made by decoction,\r\nis this; Syrups are made to keep, decoctions only for present use; for\r\nyou can hardly keep a decoction a week at any time; if the weather be\r\nhot, not half so long.\r\n\r\n2. Decoctions are made of leaves, roots, flowers, seeds, fruits or\r\nbarks, conducing to the cure of the disease you make them for; are made\r\nin the same manner as we shewed you in syrups.\r\n\r\n3. Decoctions made with wine last longer than such as are made with\r\nwater; and if you take your decoction to cleanse the passages of the\r\nurine, or open obstructions, your best way is to make it with white\r\nwine instead of water, because this is penetrating.\r\n\r\n4. Decoctions are of most use in such diseases as lie in the passages\r\nof the body, as the stomach, bowels, kidneys, passages of urine and\r\nbladder, because decoctions pass quicker to those places than any other\r\nform of medicines.\r\n\r\n5. If you will sweeten your decoction with sugar, or any syrup fit for\r\nthe occasion you take it for, which is better, you may, and no harm.\r\n\r\n6. If in a decoction, you boil both roots, herbs, flowers, and seed\r\ntogether, let the roots boil a good while first, because they retain\r\ntheir virtue longest; then the next in order by the same rule, _viz._\r\n1. Barks. 2. The herbs. 3. The seeds. 4. The flowers. 5. The spices, if\r\nyou put any in, because their virtues come soonest out.\r\n\r\n7. Such things as by boiling cause sliminess to a decoction, as figs,\r\nquince-seed, linseed, &c. your best way is, after you have bruised\r\nthem, to tie them up in a linen rag, as you tie up calf’s brains, and\r\nso boil them.\r\n\r\n8. Keep all decoctions in a glass close stopped, and in the cooler\r\nplace you keep them, the longer they will last ere they be sour.\r\n\r\nLastly, The usual dose to be given at one time, is usually two, three,\r\nfour, or five ounces, according to the age and strength of the patient,\r\nthe season of the year, the strength of the medicine, and the quality\r\nof the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n_Of Oils._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. OIL Olive, which is commonly known by the name of Sallad Oil, I\r\nsuppose, because it is usually eaten with sallads by them that love it,\r\nif it be pressed out of ripe olives, according to Galen, is temperate,\r\nand exceeds in no one quality.\r\n\r\n2. Of oils, some are simple, and some are compound.\r\n\r\n3 Simple oils, are such as are made of fruits or seeds by expression,\r\nas oil of sweet and bitter almonds, linseed and rape-seed oil, &c. of\r\nwhich see in my Dispensatory.\r\n\r\n4. Compound oils, are made of oil of olives, and other simples, imagine\r\nherbs, flowers, roots, &c.\r\n\r\n5. The way of making them is this: Having bruised the herbs or flowers\r\nyou would make your oil of, put them into an earthen pot, and to two or\r\nthree handfuls of them pour a pint of oil, cover the pot with a paper,\r\nset it in the sun about a fortnight or so, according as the sun is in\r\nhotness; then having warmed it very well by the fire, press out the\r\nherb, &c. very hard in a press, and add as many more herbs to the same\r\noil; bruise the herbs (I mean not the oil) in like manner, set them in\r\nthe sun as before; the oftener you repeat this, the stronger your oil\r\nwill be; At last when you conceive it strong enough, boil both herbs\r\nand oil together, till the juice be consumed, which you may know by its\r\nbubbling, and the herbs will be crisp; then strain it while it is hot,\r\nand keep it in a stone or glass vessel for your use.\r\n\r\n6. As for chymical oils, I have nothing to say here.\r\n\r\n7. The general use of these oils, is for pains in the limbs, roughness\r\nof the skin, the itch, &c. as also for ointments and plaisters.\r\n\r\n8. If you have occasion to use it for wounds or ulcers, in two ounces\r\nof oil, dissolve half an ounce of turpentine, the heat of the fire\r\nwill quickly do it; for oil itself is offensive to wounds, and the\r\nturpentine qualifies it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n_Of Electuaries._\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICIANS make more a quoil than needs by half, about electuaries.\r\nI shall prescribe but one general way of making them up; as for\r\ningredients, you may vary them as you please, and as you find\r\noccasion, by the last chapter.\r\n\r\n1. That you may make electuaries when you need them, it is requisite\r\nthat you keep always herbs, roots, flowers, seeds, &c. ready dried in\r\nyour house, that so you may be in a readiness to beat them into powder\r\nwhen you need them.\r\n\r\n2. It is better to keep them whole than beaten; for being beaten,\r\nthey are more subject to lose their strength; because the air soon\r\npenetrates them.\r\n\r\n3. If they be not dry enough to beat into powder when you need them,\r\ndry them by a gentle fire till they are so.\r\n\r\n4. Having beaten them, sift them through a fine tiffany searce, that no\r\ngreat pieces may be found in your electuary.\r\n\r\n5. To one ounce of your powder add three ounces of clarified honey;\r\nthis quantity I hold to be sufficient. If you would make more or less\r\nelectuary, vary your proportion accordingly.\r\n\r\n6. Mix them well together in a mortar, and take this for a truth, you\r\ncannot mix them too much.\r\n\r\n7. The way to clarify honey, is to set it over the fire in a convenient\r\nvessel, till the scum rise, and when the scum is taken off, it is\r\nclarified.\r\n\r\n8. The usual dose of cordial electuaries, is from half a dram to two\r\ndrams; of purging electuaries, from half an ounce to an ounce.\r\n\r\n9. The manner of keeping them is in a pot.\r\n\r\n10. The time of taking them, is either in a morning fasting, and\r\nfasting an hour after them; or at night going to bed, three or four\r\nhours after supper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n_Of Conserves._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE way of making conserves is two-fold, one of herbs and flowers,\r\nand the other of fruits.\r\n\r\n2. Conserves of herbs and flowers, are thus made: if you make your\r\nconserves of herbs, as of scurvy-grass, wormwood, rue, and the like,\r\ntake only the leaves and tender tops (for you may beat your heart out\r\nbefore you can beat the stalks small) and having beaten them, weigh\r\nthem, and to every pound of them add three pounds of sugar, you cannot\r\nbeat them too much.\r\n\r\n3. Conserves of fruits, as of barberries, sloes and the like, is thus\r\nmade: First, Scald the fruit, then rub the pulp through a thick hair\r\nsieve made for the purpose, called a pulping sieve; you may do it for a\r\nneed with the back of a spoon: then take this pulp thus drawn, and add\r\nto it its weight of sugar, and no more; put it into a pewter vessel,\r\nand over a charcoal fire; stir it up and down till the sugar be melted,\r\nand your conserve is made.\r\n\r\n4. Thus you have the way of making conserves; the way of keeping them\r\nis in earthen pots.\r\n\r\n5. The dose is usually the quantity of a nutmeg at a time morning and\r\nevening, or (unless they are purging) when you please.\r\n\r\n6. Of conserves, some keep many years, as conserves of roses: others\r\nbut a year, as conserves of Borage, Bugloss, Cowslips and the like.\r\n\r\n7. Have a care of the working of some conserves presently after they\r\nare made; look to them once a day, and stir them about; conserves of\r\nBorage, Bugloss, Wormwood, have got an excellent faculty at that sport.\r\n\r\n8. You may know when your conserves are almost spoiled by this; you\r\nshall find a hard crust at top with little holes in it, as though worms\r\nhad been eating there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n_Of Preserves._\r\n\r\n\r\nOF Preserves are sundry sorts, and the operation of all being somewhat\r\ndifferent, we will handle them all apart. These are preserved with\r\nsugar:\r\n\r\n    1. Flowers.\r\n    2. Fruits.\r\n    3. Roots.\r\n    4. Barks.\r\n\r\n1. Flowers are very seldom preserved; I never saw any that I remember,\r\nsave only cowslip flowers, and that was a great fashion in Sussex when\r\nI was a boy. It is thus done, Take a flat glass, we call them jat\r\nglasses; strew on a laying of fine sugar, on that a laying of flowers,\r\nand on that another laying of sugar, on that another laying of flowers,\r\nso do till your glass be full; then tie it over with a paper, and in a\r\nlittle time, you shall have very excellent and pleasant preserves.\r\n\r\nThere is another way of preserving flowers; namely, with vinegar and\r\nsalt, as they pickle capers and broom-buds; but as I have little skill\r\nin it myself, I cannot teach you.\r\n\r\n2. Fruits, as quinces, and the like, are preserved two ways;\r\n\r\n(1.) Boil them well in water, and then pulp them through a sieve, as\r\nwe shewed you before; then with the like quantity of sugar, boil the\r\nwater they were boiled in into a syrup, viz. a pound of sugar to a pint\r\nof liquor; to every pound of this syrup, add four ounces of the pulp;\r\nthen boil it with a very gentle fire to their right consistence, which\r\nyou may easily know if you drop a drop of it upon a trencher; if it be\r\nenough, it will not stick to your fingers when it is cold.\r\n\r\n(2.) Another way to preserve fruits is this; First, Pare off the rind;\r\nthen cut them in halves, and take out the core: then boil them in water\r\ntill they are soft; if you know when beef is boiled enough, you may\r\neasily know when they are; Then boil the water with its like weight of\r\nsugar into a syrup; put the syrup into a pot, and put the boiled fruit\r\nas whole as you left it when you cut it into it, and let it remain\r\nuntil you have occasion to use it.\r\n\r\n3. Roots are thus preserved; First, Scrape them very clean, and cleanse\r\nthem from the pith, if they have any, for some roots have not, as\r\nEringo and the like; Boil them in water till they be soft, as we shewed\r\nyou before in the fruits; then boil the water you boiled the root in\r\ninto a syrup, as we shewed you before; then keep the root whole in the\r\nsyrup till you use them.\r\n\r\n4. As for barks, we have but few come to our hands to be done, and of\r\nthose the few that I can remember, are, oranges, lemons, citrons, and\r\nthe outer bark of walnuts, which grow without-side the shell, for the\r\nshells themselves would make but scurvy preserves; these be they I can\r\nremember, if there be any more put them into the number.\r\n\r\nThe way of preserving these, is not all one in authors, for some are\r\nbitter, some are hot; such as are bitter, say authors, must be soaked\r\nin warm water, oftentimes changing till their bitter taste be fled; But\r\nI like not this way and my reason is this; Because I doubt when their\r\nbitterness is gone, so is their virtue also; I shall then prescribe one\r\ncommon way, namely, the same with the former, _viz._ First, boil them\r\nwhole till they be soft, then make a syrup with sugar and the liquor\r\nyou boil them in, and keep the barks in the syrup.\r\n\r\n5. They are kept in glasses or in glaz’d pots.\r\n\r\n6. The preserved flowers will keep a year, if you can forbear eating of\r\nthem; the roots and barks much longer.\r\n\r\n7. This art was plainly and first invented for delicacy, yet came\r\nafterwards to be of excellent use in physic; For,\r\n\r\n(1.) Hereby medicines are made pleasant for sick and squeamish\r\nstomachs, which else would loath them.\r\n\r\n(2.) Hereby they are preserved from decaying a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n_Of Lohocks._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THAT which the Arabians call Lohocks, and the Greeks Eclegma, the\r\nLatins call Linctus, and in plain English signifies nothing else but a\r\nthing to be licked up.\r\n\r\n2. They are in body thicker than a syrup, and not so thick as an\r\nelectuary.\r\n\r\n3. The manner of taking them is, often to take a little with a\r\nliquorice stick, and let it go down at leisure.\r\n\r\n4. They are easily thus made; Make a decoction of pectoral herbs, and\r\nthe treatise will furnish you with enough, and when you have strained\r\nit, with twice its weight of honey or sugar, boil it to a lohock; if\r\nyou are molested with much phlegm, honey is better than sugar; and if\r\nyou add a little vinegar to it, you will do well; if not, I hold sugar\r\nto be better than honey.\r\n\r\n5. It is kept in pots, and may be kept a year and longer.\r\n\r\n6. It is excellent for roughness of the wind-pipe, inflammations and\r\nulcers of the lungs, difficulty of breathing, asthmas, coughs, and\r\ndistillation of humours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n_Of Ointments._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. VARIOUS are the ways of making ointments, which authors have left\r\nto posterity, which I shall omit, and quote one which is easiest to\r\nbe made, and therefore most beneficial to people that are ignorant in\r\nphysic, for whose sake I write this. It is thus done:\r\n\r\nBruise those herbs, flowers, or roots, you will make an ointment of,\r\nand to two handfuls of your bruised herbs add a pound of hog’s grease\r\ndried, or cleansed from the skins, beat them very well together in a\r\nstone mortar with a wooden pestle, then put it into a stone pot, (the\r\nherb and grease I mean, not the mortar,) cover it with a paper and set\r\nit either in the sun, or some other warm place; three, four, or five\r\ndays, that it may melt; then take it out and boil it a little; then\r\nwhilst it is hot, strain it out, pressing it out very hard in a press:\r\nto this grease add as many more herbs bruised as before; let them stand\r\nin like manner as long, then boil them as you did the former; If you\r\nthink your ointment is not strong enough, you may do it the third and\r\nfourth time; yet this I will tell you, the fuller of juice the herbs\r\nare, the sooner will your ointment be strong; the last time you boil\r\nit, boil it so long till your herbs be crisp, and the juice consumed,\r\nthen strain it pressing it hard in a press, and to every pound of\r\nointment add two ounces of turpentine, and as much wax, because grease\r\nis offensive to wounds, as well as oil.\r\n\r\n2. Ointments are vulgarly known to be kept in pots, and will last above\r\na year, some above two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n_Of Plaisters._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE Greeks made their plaisters of divers simples, and put metals\r\ninto the most of them, if not all; for having reduced their metals into\r\npowder, they mixed them with that fatty substance whereof the rest of\r\nthe plaister consisted, whilst it was thus hot, continually stirring\r\nit up and down, lest it should sink to the bottom; so they continually\r\nstirred it till it was stiff; then they made it up in rolls, which when\r\nthey needed for use, they could melt by the fire again.\r\n\r\n2. The Arabians made up theirs with oil and fat, which needed not so\r\nlong boiling.\r\n\r\n3. The Greeks emplaisters consisted of these ingredients, metals,\r\nstones, divers sorts of earth, feces, juices, liquors, seeds, roots,\r\nherbs, excrements of creatures, wax, rosin, gums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n_Of Poultices._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. POULTICES are those kind of things which the Latins call\r\n_Cataplasmata_, and our learned fellows, that if they can read English,\r\nthat’s all, call them Cataplasms, because ’tis a crabbed word few\r\nunderstand; it is indeed a very fine kind of medicine to ripen sores.\r\n\r\n2. They are made of herbs and roots, fitted for the disease, and\r\nmembers afflicted, being chopped small, and boiled in water almost to\r\na jelly; then by adding a little barleymeal, or meal of lupins, and a\r\nlittle oil, or rough sweet suet, which I hold to be better, spread upon\r\na cloth and apply to the grieved places.\r\n\r\n3. Their use is to ease pain, to break sores, to cool inflammations,\r\nto dissolve hardness, to ease the spleen, to concoct humours, and\r\ndissipate swellings.\r\n\r\n4. I beseech you take this caution along with you; Use no poultices (if\r\nyou can help it) that are of an healing nature, before you have first\r\ncleansed the body, because they are subject to draw the humours to them\r\nfrom every part of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n_Of Troches._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE Latins call them _Placentula_, or little cakes, and the Greeks\r\n_Prochikois_, _Kukliscoi_, and _Artiscoi_; they are usually little\r\nround flat cakes, or you may make them square if you will.\r\n\r\n2. Their first invention was, that powders being so kept might resist\r\nthe intermission of air, and so endure pure the longer.\r\n\r\n3. Besides, they are easier carried in the pockets of such as travel;\r\nas many a man (for example) is forced to travel whose stomach is too\r\ncold, or at least not so hot as it should be, which is most proper,\r\nfor the stomach is never cold till a man be dead; in such a case, it\r\nis better to carry troches of wormwood, or galangal, in a paper in his\r\npocket, than to lay a gallipot along with him.\r\n\r\n4. They are made thus; At night when you go to bed, take two drams of\r\nfine gum tragacanth; put it into a gallipot, and put half a quarter of\r\na pint of any distilled water fitting for the purpose you would make\r\nyour troches for to cover it, and the next morning you shall find it in\r\nsuch a jelly as the physicians call mucilage; With this you may (with\r\na little pains taken) make a powder into a paste, and that paste into\r\ncakes called troches.\r\n\r\n5. Having made them, dry them in the shade, and keep them in a pot for\r\nyour use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n_Of Pills._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THEY are called _Pilulæ_, because they resemble little balls; the\r\nGreeks call them _Catapotia_.\r\n\r\n2. It is the opinion of modern physicians, that this way of making\r\nmedicines, was invented only to deceive the palate, that so by\r\nswallowing them down whole, the bitterness of the medicine might not be\r\nperceived, or at least it might not be unsufferable: and indeed most of\r\ntheir pills, though not all, are very bitter.\r\n\r\n3. I am of a clean contrary opinion to this. I rather think they\r\nwere done up in this hard form, that so they might be the longer in\r\ndigesting; and my opinion is grounded upon reason too, not upon fancy,\r\nor hearsay. The first invention of pills was to purge the head, now, as\r\nI told you before, such infirmities as lie near the passages were best\r\nremoved by decoctions, because they pass to the grieved part soonest;\r\nso here, if the infirmity lies in the head, or any other remote part,\r\nthe best way is to use pills, because they are longer in digestion,\r\nand therefore the better able to call the offending humour to them.\r\n\r\n4. If I should tell you here a long tale of medicine working by\r\nsympathy and antipathy, you would not understand a word of it: They\r\nthat are set to make physicians may find it in the treatise. All modern\r\nphysicians know not what belongs to a sympathetical cure, no more than\r\na cuckow what belongs to flats and sharps in music, but follow the\r\nvulgar road, and call it a hidden quality, because ’tis hidden from the\r\neyes of dunces, and indeed none but astrologers can give a reason for\r\nit; and physic without reason is like a pudding without fat.\r\n\r\n5. The way to make pills is very easy, for with the help of a pestle\r\nand mortar, and a little diligence, you may make any powder into pills,\r\neither with syrup, or the jelly I told you before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n    _The way of mixing Medicines according to the Cause of the\r\n    Disease, and Parts of the Body afflicted._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS being indeed the key of the work, I shall be somewhat the more\r\ndiligent in it. I shall deliver myself thus;\r\n\r\n1. To the Vulgar.\r\n\r\n2. To such as study Astrology; or such as study physic astrologically.\r\n\r\n1st, To the Vulgar. Kind souls, I am sorry it hath been your hard\r\nmishap to have been so long trained in such Egyptian darkness which to\r\nyour sorrow may be felt; The vulgar road of physic is not my practice,\r\nand I am therefore the more unfit to give you advice. I have now\r\npublished a little book, (_Galen’s Art of Physic_,) which will fully\r\ninstruct you, not only in the knowledge of your own bodies, but also\r\nin fit medicines to remedy each part of it when afflicted; in the mean\r\nseason take\r\n\r\n1. With the disease, regard the cause, and the part of the body\r\nafflicted; for example, suppose a woman be subject to miscarry, through\r\nwind, thus do;\r\n\r\n(1.) Look Abortion in the table of diseases, and you shall be directed\r\nby that, how many herbs prevent miscarriage.\r\n\r\n(2.) Look Wind in the same table, and you shall see how many of these\r\nherbs expel wind.\r\n\r\nThese are the herbs medicinal for your grief.\r\n\r\n2. In all diseases strengthen the part of the body afflicted.\r\n\r\n3. In mix’d diseases there lies some difficulty, for sometimes two\r\nparts of the body are afflicted with contrary humours, as sometimes the\r\nliver is afflicted with choler and water, as when a man hath both the\r\ndropsy and the yellow-jaundice; and this is usually mortal.\r\n\r\nIn the former, Suppose the brain be too cool and moist, and the liver\r\nbe too hot and dry; thus do;\r\n\r\n1. Keep your head outwardly warm.\r\n\r\n2. Accustom yourself to the smell of hot herbs.\r\n\r\n3. Take a pill that heats the head at night going to bed.\r\n\r\n4. In the morning take a decoction that cools the liver, for that\r\nquickly passes the stomach, and is at the liver immediately.\r\n\r\nYou must not think, courteous people, that I can spend time to give you\r\nexamples of all diseases; These are enough to let you see so much light\r\nas you without art are able to receive; If I should set you to look at\r\nthe sun, I should dazzle your eyes, and make you blind.\r\n\r\n2dly, To such as study Astrology, (who are the only men I know that are\r\nfit to study physic, physic without astrology being like a lamp without\r\noil) you are the men I exceedingly respect, and such documents as my\r\nbrain can give you at present (being absent from my study) I shall give\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n1. Fortify the body with herbs of the nature of the Lord of the\r\nAscendant, ’tis no matter whether he be a Fortune or Infortune in this\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n2. Let your medicine be something antipathetical to the Lord of the\r\nsixth.\r\n\r\n3. Let your medicine be something of the nature of the sign ascending.\r\n\r\n4. If the Lord of the Tenth be strong, make use of his medicines.\r\n\r\n5. If this cannot well be, make use of the medicines of the Light of\r\nTime.\r\n\r\n6. Be sure always to fortify the grieved part of the body by\r\nsympathetical remedies.\r\n\r\n7. Regard the heart, keep that upon the wheels, because the Sun is the\r\nfoundation of life, and therefore those universal remedies, _Aurum\r\nPotabile_, and the Philosopher’s Stone, cure all diseases by fortifying\r\nthe heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nENGLISH PHYSICIAN\r\n\r\nAND\r\n\r\nFAMILY DISPENSATORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ASTROLOGO-PHYSICAL DISCOURSE OF THE HUMAN VIRTUES IN THE BODY OF\r\nMAN; BOTH PRINCIPAL AND ADMINISTERING.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMAN virtues are either PRINCIPAL for _procreation, and conservation_;\r\nor ADMINISTRING, for _Attraction, Digestion, Retention, or Expulsion_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVirtues _conservative_, are Vital, Natural, and Animal.\r\n\r\nBy the _natural_ are bred Blood, Choler, Flegm, and Melancholy.\r\n\r\nThe _animal virtue_ is Intellective, and Sensitive.\r\n\r\nThe _Intellective_ is Imagination, Judgment, and Memory.\r\n\r\nThe _sensitive_ is Common, and Particular.\r\n\r\nThe _particular_ is Seeing, Hearing, Smelling, Tasting, and Feeling.\r\n\r\nTHE scope of this discourse is, To preserve in soundness and vigour,\r\nthe mind and understanding of man; to strengthen the brain, preserve\r\nthe body in health, to teach a man to be an able co-artificer, or\r\nhelper of nature, to withstand and expel Diseases.\r\n\r\nI shall touch only the principal faculties both of body and mind; which\r\nbeing kept in a due decorum, preserve the body in health, and the mind\r\nin vigour.\r\n\r\nI shall in this place speak of them only in the general, as they are\r\nlaid down to your view in the _Synopsis_, in the former pages, and in\r\nthe same order.\r\n\r\n_Virtue Procreative._] The first in order, is the Virtue Procreative:\r\nfor natural regards not only the conservation of itself, but to beget\r\nits like, and conserve in _Species_.\r\n\r\nThe seat of this is the Member of Generation, and is governed\r\nprincipally by the influence of _Venus_.\r\n\r\nIt is augmented and encreased by the strength of _Venus_, by her Herbs,\r\nRoots, Trees, Minerals, &c.\r\n\r\nIt is diminished and purged by those of _Mars_, and quite extinguished\r\nby those of _Saturn_.\r\n\r\nObserve the hour and Medicines of _Venus_, to fortify; of _Mars_, to\r\ncleanse this virtue; of _Saturn_, to extinguish it.\r\n\r\n_Conservative._] The conservative virtue is Vital, Natural, Animal.\r\n\r\n_Vital._] The Vital spirit hath its residence in the heart, and is\r\ndispersed from it by the Arteries; and is governed by the influence\r\nof the Sun. And it is to the body, as the Sun is to the Creation; as\r\nthe heart is in the _Microcosm_, so is the Sun in the _Megacosm_: for\r\nas the Sun gives life, light, and motion to the Creation, so doth the\r\nheart to the body; therefore it is called _Sol Corporis_, as the Sun is\r\ncalled _Cor Cœli_, because their operations are similar.\r\n\r\nInimical and destructive to this virtue, are _Saturn_ and _Mars_.\r\n\r\nThe Herbs and Plants of _Sol_, wonderfully fortify it.\r\n\r\n_Natural._] The natural faculty or virtue resides in the liver, and is\r\ngenerally governed by _Jupiter_, _Quasi Juvans Pater_; its office is to\r\nnourish the body, and is dispersed through the body by the veins.\r\n\r\nFrom this are bred four particular humours, _Blood, Choler, Flegm, and\r\nMelancholy_.\r\n\r\n_Blood_ is made of meat perfectly concocted, in quality hot and moist,\r\ngoverned by _Jupiter_: It is by a third concoction transmuted into\r\nflesh, the superfluity of it into seed, and its receptacle is the\r\nveins, by which it is dispersed through the body.\r\n\r\n_Choler_ is made of meat more than perfectly concocted; and it is\r\nthe spume or froth of blood: it clarifies all the humours, heats the\r\nbody, nourishes the apprehension, as blood doth the judgment: It is in\r\nquality hot and dry; fortifies the attractive faculty, as blood doth\r\nthe digestive; moves man to activity and valour: its receptacle is the\r\ngall, and it is under the influence of _Mars_.\r\n\r\n_Flegm_ is made of meat not perfectly digested; it fortifies the virtue\r\nexpulsive, makes the body slippery, fit for ejection; it fortifies the\r\nbrain by its consimilitude with it; yet it spoils apprehension by its\r\nantipathy to it: It qualifies choler, cools and moistens the heart,\r\nthereby sustaining it, and the whole body, from the fiery effects,\r\nwhich continual motion would produce. Its receptacle is the lungs,\r\nand is governed by _Venus_, some say by the _Moon_, perhaps it may be\r\ngoverned by them both, it is cold and moist in quality.\r\n\r\n_Melancholy_ is the sediment of blood, cold and dry in quality,\r\nfortifying the retentive faculty, and memory; makes men sober, solid,\r\nand staid, fit for study; stays the unbridled toys of lustful blood,\r\nstays the wandering thoughts, and reduces them home to the centre: its\r\nreceptacle is in the spleen, and it is governed by _Saturn_.\r\n\r\nOf all these humours blood is the chief, all the rest are superfluities\r\nof blood; yet are they necessary superfluities, for without any of\r\nthem, man cannot live.\r\n\r\nNamely; Choler is the fiery superfluities; Flegm, the Watery;\r\nMelancholy, the Earthly.\r\n\r\n_Animal._] The third principal virtue remains, which is Animal; its\r\nresidence is in the brain, and _Mercury_ is the general significator of\r\nit. _Ptolomy_ held the _Moon_ signified the Animal virtue; and I am of\r\nopinion, both _Mercury_ and the _Moon_ dispose it; and my reason is,\r\n1, Because both of them in nativities, either fortify, or impedite it.\r\n2, Ill directions to either, or from either, afflict it, as good ones\r\nhelp it. Indeed the _Moon_ rules the bulk of it, as also the sensitive\r\npart of it: _Mercury_ the rational part: and that’s the reason, if in\r\na nativity the _Moon_ be stronger than _Mercury_, sense many times\r\nover-powers reason; but if _Mercury_ be strong, and the _Moon_ weak,\r\nreason will be master ordinarily in despite of sense.\r\n\r\nIt is divided into Intellective, and Sensitive.\r\n\r\n1. _Intellective._] The Intellectual resides in the brain, within the\r\n_Pia mater_, is governed generally by _Mercury_.\r\n\r\nIt is divided into Imagination, Judgment, and Memory.\r\n\r\n_Imagination_ is seated in the forepart of the brain; it is hot and\r\ndry in quality, quick, active, always working; it receives vapours\r\nfrom the heart, and coins them into thoughts: it never sleeps, but\r\nalways is working, both when the man is sleeping and waking; only when\r\nJudgment is awake it regulates the Imagination, which runs at random\r\nwhen Judgment is asleep, and forms any thought according to the nature\r\nof the vapour sent up to it. _Mercury_ is out of question the disposer\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nA man may easily perceive his Judgment asleep before himself many\r\ntimes, and then he shall perceive his thoughts run at random.\r\n\r\nJudgment always sleeps when men do, Imagination never sleeps; Memory\r\nsometimes sleeps when men sleep, and sometimes it doth not: so then\r\nwhen memory is awake, and the man asleep, then memory remembers what\r\napprehension coins, and that is a dream: The thoughts would have been\r\nthe same, if memory had not been awake to remember it.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts are commonly (I mean in sleep, when they are purely\r\nnatural,) framed according to the nature of the humour, called\r\ncomplexion, which is predominate in the body; and if the humour be\r\npeccant it is always so.\r\n\r\nSo that it is one of the surest rules to know a man’s own complexion,\r\nby his dreams, I mean a man void of distractions, or deep studies:\r\n(this most assuredly shews _Mercury_ to dispose of the Imagination,\r\nas also because it is mutable, applying itself to any object, as\r\n_Mercury’s_ nature is to do;) for then the imagination will follow its\r\nold bent; for if a man be bent upon a business, his apprehension will\r\nwork as much when he is asleep, and find out as many truths by study,\r\nas when the man is awake; and perhaps more too, because then it is not\r\nhindered by ocular objects.\r\n\r\nAnd thus much for imagination, which is governed by _Mercury_, and\r\nfortified by his influence; and is also strong or weak in man,\r\naccording as _Mercury_ is strong or weak in the nativity.\r\n\r\n_Judgment_ is seated in the midst of the brain, to shew that it ought\r\nto bear rule over all the other faculties: it is the judge of the\r\nlittle world, to approve of what is good, and reject what is bad; it is\r\nthe seat of reason, and the guide of actions; so that all failings are\r\ncommitted through its infirmity, it not rightly judging between a real\r\nand an apparent good. It is hot and moist in quality, and under the\r\ninfluence of _Jupiter_.\r\n\r\n_Memory_ is seated in the hinder cell of the brain, it is the great\r\nregister to the little world; and its office is to record things either\r\ndone and past, or to be done.\r\n\r\nIt is in quality cold and dry, melancholic, and therefore generally\r\nmelancholic men have best memories, and most tenacious every way. It is\r\nunder the dominion of _Saturn_, and is fortified by his influence, but\r\npurged by the luminaries.\r\n\r\n2. _Sensitive._] The second part of the animal virtue, is sensitive,\r\nand it is divided into two parts, common and particular.\r\n\r\nCommon sense is an imaginary term, and that which gives virtue to all\r\nthe particular senses, and knits and unites them together within the\r\n_Pia Mater_. It is regulated by _Mercury_, (perhaps this is one reason\r\nwhy men are so fickle-headed) and its office is to preserve a harmony\r\namong the senses.\r\n\r\nParticular senses are five, _viz._ _seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting,\r\nand feeling_.\r\n\r\nThese senses are united in one, in the brain, by the common sense, but\r\nare operatively distinguished into their several seats, and places of\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\nThe _sight_ resides in the eyes, and particularly in the christaline\r\nhumour. It is in quality cold and moist, and governed by the\r\nluminaries. They who have them weak in their genesis, have always weak\r\nsights; if one of them be so, the weakness possesses but one eye.\r\n\r\nThe _hearing_ resides in the ears; is in quality, cold and dry,\r\nmelancholy, and under the dominion of _Saturn_.\r\n\r\nThe _smelling_ resides in the nose, is in quality hot and dry,\r\ncholeric, and that is the reason choleric creatures have so good\r\nsmells, as dogs. It is under the influence of _Mars_.\r\n\r\nThe _taste_ resides in the palate, which is placed at the root of the\r\ntongue on purpose to discern what food is congruous for the stomach,\r\nand what not; as the meseraik veins are placed to discern what\r\nnourishment is proper for the liver to convert into blood. In some very\r\nfew men, and but a few, and in those few, but in few instances these\r\ntwo tasters agree not, and that is the reason some men covet meats that\r\nmake them sick, _viz._ the taste craves them, and the meseraik veins\r\nreject them: In quality hot and moist, and is ruled by _Jupiter_.\r\n\r\nThe _feeling_ is deputed to no particular organ, but is spread abroad,\r\nover the whole body; is of all qualities, hot, cold, dry, and moist,\r\nand is the index of all tangible things; for if it were only hot alone,\r\nit could not feel a quality contrary, _viz._ cold, and this might be\r\nspoken of other qualities. It is under the dominion of _Venus_, some\r\nsay, _Mercury_: A thousand to one, but it is under _Mercury_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe four ADMINISTERING VIRTUES are, _attractive, digestive, retentive,\r\nand expulsive_.\r\n\r\nThe _attractive_ virtue is hot and dry, hot by quality, active, or\r\nprincipal, and that appears because the fountain of all heat is\r\nattractive, _viz._ the sun. Dry by a quality passive, or an effect of\r\nits heat; its office is to remain in the body, and call for what nature\r\nwants.\r\n\r\nIt is under the influence of the _Sun_, say authors, and not under\r\n_Mars_, because he is of a corrupting nature, yet if we cast an\r\nimpartial eye upon experience, we shall find, that martial men call\r\nfor meat none of the least, and for drink the most of all other men,\r\nalthough many times they corrupt the body by it, and therefore I see\r\nno reason why _Mars_ being of the same quality with the _Sun_, should\r\nnot have a share in the dominion. It is in vain to object, that the\r\ninfluence of _Mars_ is evil, and therefore he should have no dominion\r\nover this virtue; for then,\r\n\r\n1. By the same rule, he should have no dominion at all in the body of\r\nman.\r\n\r\n2. All the virtues in man are naturally evil, and corrupted by _Adam’s_\r\nfall.\r\n\r\nThis _attractive_ virtue ought to be fortified when the _Moon_ is in\r\nfiery signs, _viz._ _Aries_ and _Sagitary_, but not in _Leo_, for the\r\nsign is so violent, that no physic ought to be given when the _Moon_ is\r\nthere: (and why not _Leo_, seeing that is the most attractive sign of\r\nall; and that’s the reason such as have it ascending in their genesis,\r\nare such greedy eaters.) If you cannot stay till the _Moon_ be in one\r\nof them, let one of them ascend when you administer the medicine.\r\n\r\nThe _digestive_ virtue is hot and moist, and is the principal of them\r\nall, the other like handmaids attend it.\r\n\r\nThe _attractive_ virtue draws that which it should digest, and serves\r\ncontinually to feed and supply it.\r\n\r\nThe _retentive_ virtue, retains the substance with it, till it be\r\nperfectly digested.\r\n\r\nThe _expulsive_ virtue casteth out, expels what is superfluous by\r\ndigestion. It is under the influence of _Jupiter_, and fortified by his\r\nherbs and plants, &c. In fortifying it, let your _Moon_ be in _Gemini_,\r\n_Aquary_, or the first half of _Libra_, or if matters be come to that\r\nextremity, that you cannot stay till that time, let one of them ascend,\r\nbut both of them together would do better, always provided that the\r\n_Moon_ be not in the ascendent. I cannot believe the _Moon_ afflicts\r\nthe ascendent so much as they talk of, if she be well dignified, and in\r\na sign she delights in.\r\n\r\nThe _retentive_ virtue is in quality cold and dry; cold, because the\r\nnature of cold is to compress, witness the ice; dry, because the nature\r\nof dryness, is to keep and hold what is compressed. It is under the\r\ninfluence of _Saturn_, and that is the reason why usually Saturnine men\r\nare so covetous and tenacious. In fortifying of it, make use of the\r\nherbs and plants, &c. of _Saturn_, and let the _Moon_ be in _Taurus_\r\nor _Virgo_, _Capricorn_ is not so good, say authors, (I can give no\r\nreason for that neither;) let not _Saturn_ nor his ill aspect molest\r\nthe ascendent.\r\n\r\nThe _expulsive_ faculty is cold and moist; cold because that compasses\r\nthe superfluities; moist, because that makes the body slippery and\r\nfit for ejection, and disposes it to it. It is under the dominion of\r\n_Luna_, with whom you may join _Venus_, because she is of the same\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nAlso in whatsoever is before written, of the nature of the planets,\r\ntake notice, that fixed stars of the same nature, work the same effect.\r\n\r\nIn fortifying this, (which ought to be done in all purgations,) let\r\nthe _Moon_ be in _Cancer_, _Scorpio_, or _Pisces_, or let one of these\r\nsigns ascend.\r\n\r\n_Although I did what I could throughout the whole book to express\r\nmyself in such a language as might be understood by all, and therefore\r\navoided terms of art as much as might be, Yet, 1. Some words of\r\nnecessity fall in which need explanation. 2. It would be very tedious\r\nat the end of every receipt to repeat over and over again, the way of\r\nadministration of the receipt, or ordering your bodies after it, or to\r\ninstruct you in the mixture of medicines, and indeed would do nothing\r\nelse but stuff the book full of tautology._\r\n\r\n_To answer to both these is my task at this time._\r\n\r\n_To the first: The words which need explaining, such as are obvious to\r\nmy eye, are these that follow._\r\n\r\n_1. To distil in _Balneo Mariæ_, is the usual way of distilling\r\nin water. It is no more than to place your glass body which holds the\r\nmatter to be distilled in a convenient vessel of water, when the water\r\nis cold (for fear of breaking) put a wisp of straw, or the like under\r\nit, to keep it from the bottom, then make the water boil, that so the\r\nspirit may be distilled forth; take not the glass out till the water be\r\ncold again, for fear of breaking: It is impossible for a man to learn\r\nhow to do it, unless he saw it done._\r\n\r\n2. _Manica Hippocrates_, Hippocrates’s sleeve, is a piece of woolen\r\ncloth, new and white, sewed together in form of a sugar-loaf. Its use\r\nis, to strain any syrup or decoction through, by pouring it into it,\r\nand suffering it to run through without pressing or crushing it.\r\n\r\n3. _Calcination_, is a burning of a thing in a crucible or other such\r\nconvenient vessel that will endure the fire. A crucible is such a thing\r\nas goldsmiths melt silver in, and founders metals; you may place it in\r\nthe midst of the fire, with coals above, below, and on every side of it.\r\n\r\n4. _Filtrition_, is straining of a liquid body through a brown paper:\r\nmake up the paper in form of a funnel, the which having placed in a\r\nfunnel, and the funnel and the paper in it in an empty glass, pour in\r\nthe liquor you would filter, and let it run through at its leisure.\r\n\r\n5. _Coagulation_, is curdling or hardening: it is used in physic for\r\nreducing a liquid body to hardness by the heat of the fire.\r\n\r\n6. Whereas you find _vital_, _natural_, and _animal spirits_ often\r\nmentioned in the virtues or receipts, I shall explain what they be, and\r\nwhat their operation is in the body of man.\r\n\r\nThe actions or operations of the animal virtues, are, 1. _sensitive_,\r\n2. _motive_.\r\n\r\nThe sensitive is, 1. _external_, 2. _internal_.\r\n\r\nThe external senses are, 1. _seeing_, 2. _hearing_, 3. _tasting_, 4.\r\n_smelling_, 5. _feeling_.\r\n\r\nThe internal senses are, 1. _the Imagination, to apprehend a thing_. 2.\r\n_Judgment, to judge of it_. 3. _Memory, to remember it_.\r\n\r\nThe seat of all these is in the brain.\r\n\r\nThe _vital spirits_ proceed from the heart, and cause in man _mirth_,\r\n_joy_, _hope_, _trust_, _humanity_, _mildness_, _courage_, _&c._ and\r\ntheir opposite: _viz._ _sadness_, _fear_, _care_, _sorrow_, _despair_,\r\n_envy_, _hatred_, _stubbornness_, _revenge_, _&c._ by heat natural or\r\nnot natural.\r\n\r\nThe _natural spirit_ nourishes the body throughout (as the vital\r\nquickens it, and the animal gives it sense and motion) its office is to\r\nalter or concoct food into chile, chile into blood, blood into flesh,\r\nto form, engender, nourish, and increase the body.\r\n\r\n7. _Infusion_, is to steep a gross body into one more liquid.\r\n\r\n8. _Decoction_, is the liquor in which any thing is boiled.\r\n\r\nAs for the manner of using or ordering the body after any sweating,\r\nor purging medicines, or pills, or the like, they will be found in\r\ndifferent parts of the work, as also in the next page.\r\n\r\nThe different forms of making up medicines, as some into syrups,\r\nothers into electuaries, pills, troches, &c. was partly to please\r\nthe different palates of people, that so medicines might be more\r\ndelightful, or at least less burdensome. You may make the mixtures\r\nof them in what form you please, only for your better instruction at\r\npresent, accept of these few lines.\r\n\r\n1. Consider, that all diseases are cured by their contraries, but all\r\nparts of the body maintained by their likes: then if heat be the cause\r\nof the disease, give the cold medicine appropriated to it; if wind, see\r\nhow many medicines appropriated to that disease expel wind, and use\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n2. Have a care you use not such medicines to one part of your body\r\nwhich are appropriated to another, for if your brain be over heated,\r\nand you use such medicines as cool the heart or liver, you may make bad\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n3. The distilled water of any herb you would take for a disease, is a\r\nfit mixture for the syrup of the same herb, or to make any electuary\r\ninto a drink, if you affect such liquid medicines best; if you have not\r\nthe distilled water, make use of the decoction.\r\n\r\n4. Diseases that lie in the parts of the body remote from the stomach\r\nand bowels, it is in vain to think to carry away the cause at once, and\r\ntherefore you had best do it by degrees; pills, and such like medicines\r\nwhich are hard in the body, are fittest for such a business, because\r\nthey are longest before they digest.\r\n\r\n5. Use no strong medicines, if weak will serve the turn, you had better\r\ntake one too weak by half, than too strong in the least.\r\n\r\n6. Consider the natural temper of the part of the body afflicted, and\r\nmaintain it in that, else you extinguish nature, as the heart is hot,\r\nthe brain cold, or at least the coldest part of the body.\r\n\r\n7. Observe this general rule; That such medicines as are hot in the\r\nfirst degree are most habitual to our bodies, because they are just of\r\nthe heat of our blood.\r\n\r\n8. All opening medicines, and such as provoke urine or the menses, or\r\nbreak the stone, may most conveniently be given in white wine, because\r\nwhite wine of itself is of an opening nature, and cleanses the veins.\r\n\r\n9. Let all such medicines as are taken to stop fluxes or looseness, be\r\ntaken before meat, about an hour before, more or less, that so they may\r\nstrengthen the digestion and retentive faculty, before the food come\r\ninto the stomach, but such as are subject to vomit up their meat, let\r\nthem take such medicines as stay vomiting presently after meat, at the\r\nconclusion of their meals, that so they may close up the mouth of the\r\nstomach; and that is the reason why usually men eat a bit of cheese\r\nafter meat, because by its sourness and binding it closes the mouth of\r\nthe stomach, thereby staying belching and vomiting.\r\n\r\n10. In taking purges be very careful, and that you may be so, observe\r\nthese rules.\r\n\r\n(1.) Consider what the humour offending is, and let the medicine be\r\nsuch as purges that humour, else you will weaken nature, not the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n(2.) Take notice, if the humour you would purge out be thin, then\r\ngentle medicines will serve the turn, but if it be tough and viscous,\r\nthen such medicines as are cutting and opening, the night before you\r\nwould take the purge.\r\n\r\n(3.) In purging tough humours, forbear as much as may be such medicines\r\nas leave a binding quality behind them.\r\n\r\n(4.) Have a care of taking purges when your body is astringent; your\r\nbest way, is first to open it by a clyster.\r\n\r\n(5.) In taking opening medicines, you may safely take them at night,\r\neating but a little supper three or four hours before, and the next\r\nmorning drinking a draught of warm posset-drink, and you need not\r\nfear to go about your business. In this manner you may take _Lenitive\r\nElectuary_, _Diacatholicon_, _Pulp of Cassia_, and the like gentle\r\nelectuaries, as also all pills that have neither _Diagrydium_ nor\r\n_Colocynthus_, in them. But all violent purges require a due ordering\r\nof the body; such ought to be taken in the morning after you are up,\r\nand not to sleep after them before they are done working, at least\r\nbefore night: two hours after you have taken them, drink a draught\r\nof warm posset-drink, or broth, and six hours after eat a bit of\r\nmutton, often walking about the chamber; let there be a good fire in\r\nthe chamber, and stir not out of the chamber till the purge have done\r\nworking, or not till next day.\r\n\r\nLastly, Take sweating medicines when you are in bed, covered warm, and\r\nin the time of your sweating drink posset-drink as hot as you can. If\r\nyou sweat for a fever, boil sorrel and red sage in your posset-drink,\r\nsweat an hour or longer if your strength will permit, then (the chamber\r\nbeing kept very warm) shift yourself all but your head, about which\r\n(the cap which you sweat in being still kept on) wrap a napkin very\r\nhot, to repel the vapours back.\r\n\r\nI confess these, or many of these directions may be found in one place\r\nof the book or other, and I delight as little to write tautology as\r\nanother, but considering it might make for the public good, I inserted\r\nthem in this place: if, notwithstanding, any will be so mad as to do\r\nthemselves a mischief, the fault is not mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ROOTS.\r\n\r\n_Acanths, Brancæ Ursinæ._ Of bearsbreech, or brankursine, it is meanly\r\nhot and dry, helps aches and numness of the joints, and is of a binding\r\nquality, good for wounds and broken bones. _Dioscorides_ saith, they\r\nare profitable for ruptures, or such as are bursten, or burnt with\r\nfire, a dram of the root in powder being taken in the morning fasting,\r\nin a decoction made with the same root and water.\r\n\r\n_Acori, Veri, Perigrini, vulgaris, &c._ See _Calamus Aromaticus_. I\r\nshall not speak concerning the several sorts of it, one of which is\r\nWater-flag, or Flower-de-luce, which is hot and dry in the second\r\ndegree, binds, strengthens, stops fluxes of the belly, and immoderate\r\nflowing of the menses, a dram being taken in red wine every morning.\r\n\r\n_Allium._ Garlic. It is hot and dry in the fourth degree, breeds\r\ncorrupt blood, yet is an enemy to all poisons, and such as are bitten\r\nby cold venomous beasts, viz. Adders, Toads, Spiders, &c. it provokes\r\nurine, and expels wind.\r\n\r\n_Alcannæ._ Of privet. See the leaves.\r\n\r\n_Althææ._ Of Marsh mallows, are meanly hot, of a digesting, softening\r\nnature, ease pains, help bloody fluxes, the stone, and gravel; being\r\nbruised and boiled in milk, and the milk drank, is a good remedy for\r\ngripings of the belly, and the bloody flux. If a fever accompany the\r\ndisease, boil a handful of common mallow leaves with a handful of these\r\nroots.\r\n\r\n_Angelicæ._ Of Angelica; is hot and dry in the third degree,\r\nstrengthens the heart, and is good against pestilence and poison, half\r\na dram taken in the morning fasting.\r\n\r\n_Anchusæ._ Of Alkanet; cold and dry, binding, good for old ulcers.\r\n\r\n_Anthoræ._ A foreign root, the counterpoison for Monkshood, it is an\r\nadmirable remedy for the wind cholic, and resists poison.\r\n\r\n_Apii._ Of smallage. See the barks.\r\n\r\n_Aristolochiæ._ Of birthwort; of which are three sorts, long, round,\r\nand climing: All hot and dry in the third degree. The long, being\r\ndrank in wine, brings away both birth and after-birth, and whatsoever\r\na careless midwife hath left behind. _Dioscorides, Galen._ The round,\r\nbeing drank with wine, helps (besides the former) stuffings of the\r\nlungs, hardness of the spleen, ruptures, convulsions; both of them\r\nresist poison.

They say they are hot and dry in the fourth degree;\r\nthey breed ill-favoured nourishment at the best, they spoil the eyes,\r\nheat the body, cause troublesome sleep, and are noisome to the stomach:\r\nyet are they good for something else, for the juice of them dropped\r\ninto the ears takes away the noise of them, mixed with a little vinegar\r\nand snuffed up the nose, it stays the bleeding of it, they are better\r\nof the two boiled than raw, but both ways exceedingly hurtful for\r\nulcers in the bladder: and so are onions and garlic.\r\n\r\n_Prunellorum Silvestrium._ Of Sloe-bush, or Sloe-tree. I think the\r\ncollege set this amongst the roots only for fashion sake, and I did it\r\nbecause they did.\r\n\r\n_Pyrethri Salivaris, &c._ Pelitory of Spain. It is hot and dry in\r\nthe fourth degree, chewed in the mouth, it draws away rheum in the\r\ntooth-ache; bruised and boiled in oil, it provokes sweat by unction;\r\ninwardly taken, they say it helps palsies and other cold effects in the\r\nbrain and nerves.\r\n\r\n_Rhapontici_, Rhupontick, or Rhubarb of Pontus.

It gently purges choler from the stomach\r\nand liver, opens stoppings, withstands the dropsy, Hypocondriac\r\nMelancholly; a little boiling takes away the virtue of it, and\r\ntherefore it is best given by infusion only; If your body be any thing\r\nstrong, you may take two drams of it at a time being sliced thin and\r\nsteeped all night in white wine, in the morning strain it out and drink\r\nthe white wine; it purges but gently, it leaves a binding quality\r\nbehind it, therefore dried a little by the fire and beaten into powder,\r\nit is usually given in fluxes.\r\n\r\n_Rhaphani, Domesticœ and Sylvestris._ Of Raddishes, garden and wild.\r\nGarden Raddishes provoke urine, break the stone, and purge by urine\r\nexceedingly, yet breed very bad blood, are offensive to the stomach,\r\nand hard of digestion, hot and dry in quality.

They are hot and moist in\r\ntemper, provoke venery, and increase seed; each branch bears two roots,\r\nboth spongy, yet the one more solid than the other, which is of most\r\nvirtue, and indeed only to be used, for some say the most spongy root\r\nis quite contrary in operation to the other, as the one increaseth, the\r\nother decreaseth.\r\n\r\n_Saxifragiæ albæ._ Of white Saxifrage, in _Sussex_ we call them\r\nLady-smocks.

This and _Zurumbet_, according to\r\n_Rhasis_, and _Mesue_, are all one; _Avicenna_ thinks them different:\r\nI hold with _Mesue_; indeed they differ in form, for the one is long,\r\nthe other round; they are both hot and dry in the second degree, expel\r\nwind, resist poison, stop fluxes, and the menses, stay vomiting, help\r\nthe cholic, and kill worms; you may take half a dram at a time.\r\n\r\n_Zingiberis._ Of Ginger.

Take notice here, that the Barks\r\nboth of this root, as also of Parsley, Fennel, &c. is all of the root\r\nwhich is in use, neither can it properly be called bark, for it is all\r\nthe root, the hard pith in the middle excepted, which is always thrown\r\naway, when the roots are used. It is something hotter and drier than\r\nParsley, and more medicinal; it opens stoppings, provokes urine, helps\r\ndigestion, expels wind, and warms a cold stomach: use them like grass\r\nroots.\r\n\r\n_Avellanarum._ Of Hazel. The rind of the tree provokes urine, breaks\r\nthe stone; the husks and shells of the nuts, dried and given in powder,\r\nstay the immoderate flux of the menses.\r\n\r\n_Aurantiorum._ Of Oranges. Both these, and also Lemons and Citrons,\r\nare of different qualities: the outward bark, _viz._ what looks red,\r\nis hot and dry, the white is cold and moist, the juice colder than it,\r\nthe seeds hot and dry; the outward bark is that which here I am to\r\nspeak to, it is somewhat hotter than either that of Lemons or Citrons,\r\ntherefore it warms a cold stomach more, and expels wind better, but\r\nstrengthens not the heart so much.\r\n\r\n_Berber, &c._ Barberries. The Rind of the tree according to _Clœsius_,\r\nbeing steeped in wine, and the wine drank, purges choler, and is a\r\nsingular remedy for the yellow jaundice. Boil it in white wine and\r\ndrink it.

In ointments it takes\r\naway red pimples, and the like deformities from the face. There is\r\nscarce a better remedy for women in labour, than a dram of Cinnamon\r\nnewly beaten into powder, and taken in white wine.\r\n\r\n_Citrij._ Of Pome Citrons. The outward pill, which I suppose is that\r\nwhich is meant here: It strengthens the heart, resists poison, amends\r\na stinking breath, helps digestion, comforts a cold stomach.\r\n\r\n_Ebuli Rad._ Of the roots of Dwarf-Elder, or Walwort.

Pomegranate flowers are\r\nof the same virtue.\r\n\r\n_Gatrujaci._ See the wood.\r\n\r\n_Juglandium Virid._ Of green Walnuts. As for the outward green bark of\r\nWalnuts, I suppose the best time to take them is before the Walnuts\r\nbe shelled at all, and then you may take nuts and all (if they may\r\nproperly be called nuts at such a time) you shall find them exceeding\r\ncomfortable to the stomach, they resist poison, and are a most\r\nexcellent preservative against the plague, inferior to none: they are\r\nadmirable for such as are troubled with consumptions of the lungs.\r\n\r\n_Lauri._ Of the Bay-tree. See the root.\r\n\r\n_Limonum._ Of Lemons.

You may take half a dram at a time.\r\n\r\n_Mastich_, strengthens the stomach exceedingly, helps such as vomit or\r\nspit blood, it fastens the teeth and strengthens the gums, being chewed\r\nin the mouth.\r\n\r\n_Frankinsense_, and _Olibanum_, heat and bind, fill up old ulcers with\r\nflesh, stop bleeding, but is extremely bad for mad people.\r\n\r\n_Turpentine_, Purges, cleanses the reins, helps the running of them.\r\n\r\n_Styrax Calamitis_, helps coughs, and distillations upon the lungs,\r\nhoarseness, want of voice, hardness of the womb, but it is bad for\r\nhead-aches.\r\n\r\n_Ammonicaum_, applied to the side, helps the hardness and pains of the\r\nspleen.\r\n\r\n_Camphire_, eases pains of the head coming of heat, takes away\r\ninflammations, and cools any place to which it is applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n    JUICES.\r\n\r\nTHAT all juices have the same virtues with the herbs or fruits whereof\r\nthey are made, I suppose few or none will deny, therefore I shall only\r\nname a few of them, and that briefly.\r\n\r\n_Sugar_ is held to be hot in the first degree, strengthens the lungs,\r\ntakes away the roughness of the throat, succours the reins and bladder.\r\n\r\nThe juice of _Citrons_ cools the blood, strengthens the heart,\r\nmitigates the violent heat of fevers.\r\n\r\nThe juice of _Lemons_ works the same effect, but not so powerfully.\r\n\r\nJuice of _Liquorice_, strengthens the lungs, helps coughs and colds.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THINGS BRED FROM PLANTS.\r\n\r\n_These have been treated of before, only two excepted. The first of\r\nwhich is,_\r\n\r\nAgaricus. _Agarick: It purges flegm, choler, and melancholy, from the\r\nbrain, nerves, muscles, marrow, (or more properly brain) of the back,\r\nit cleanses the breast, lungs, liver, stomach, spleen, reins, womb,\r\njoints; it provokes urine, and the menses, kills worms, helps pains in\r\nthe joints, and causes a good colour: it is very seldom or never taken\r\nalone. See Syrup of Roses with Agarick._\r\n\r\n_Lastly, _Vicus Quircinus_, or Misleto of the Oak, helps the\r\nfalling-sickness being either taken inwardly, or hung about one’s\r\nneck._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    LIVING CREATURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMillepedes _(so called from the multitude of their feet, though it\r\ncannot be supposed they have a thousand) sows, hog-lice, wood-lice,\r\nbeing bruised and mixed with wine, they provoke urine, help the yellow\r\njaundice, outwardly being boiled in oil, help pains in the ears, a drop\r\nbeing put into them_.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of vipers _being eaten, clear the sight, help the vices of\r\nthe nerves, resist poison exceedingly, neither is there any better\r\nremedy under the sun for their bitings than the head of the viper that\r\nbit you, bruised and applied to the place, and the flesh eaten, you\r\nneed not eat above a dram at a time, and make it up as you shall be\r\ntaught in troches of vipers. Neither any comparable to the stinging of\r\nbees and wasps, &c. than the same that sting you, bruised and applied\r\nto the place._\r\n\r\nLand Scorpions _cure their own stingings by the same means; the ashes\r\nof them (being burnt) potently provokes urine, and breaks the stone_.\r\n\r\nEarth-worms, _are an admirable remedy for cut nerves being applied to\r\nthe place; they provoke urine; see the oil of them, only let me not\r\nforget one notable thing quoted by _Mizaldus_, which is, That the\r\npowder of them put into an hollow tooth, makes it drop out_.\r\n\r\nTo draw a tooth without pain, _fill an earthen crucible full of Emmets,\r\nAnts, or Pismires, eggs and all, and when you have burned them, keep\r\nthe ashes, with which if you touch a tooth it will fall out_.\r\n\r\nEels, _being put into wine or beer, and suffered to die in it, he that\r\ndrinks it will never endure that sort of liquor again_.\r\n\r\nOysters _applied alive to a pestilential swelling, draw the venom to\r\nthem_.\r\n\r\nCrab-fish, _burnt to ashes, and a dram of it taken every morning helps\r\nthe bitings of mad dogs, and all other venomous beasts_.\r\n\r\nSwallows, _being eaten, clear the sight, the ashes of them (being\r\nburnt) eaten, preserve from drunkenness, helps sore throats being\r\napplied to them, and inflammations_.\r\n\r\nGrass-hoppers, _being eaten, ease the cholic, and pains in the bladder_.\r\n\r\nHedge Sparrows, _being kept in salt, or dried and eaten raw, are an\r\nadmirable remedy for the stone_.\r\n\r\nYoung Pigeons _being eaten, help pains in the reins, and the disease\r\ncalled Tenesmus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PARTS OF LIVING CREATURES,\r\n    AND EXCREMENTS.\r\n\r\nTHE brain of _Sparrows_ being eaten, provokes lust exceedingly.\r\n\r\nThe brain of an _Hare_ being roasted, helps trembling, it makes\r\nchildren breed teeth easily, their gums being rubbed with it, it also\r\nhelps scald heads, and falling off of hair, the head being anointed\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nThe head of a young _Kite_, being burnt to ashes and the quantity of\r\na drachm of it taken every morning in a little water, is an admirable\r\nremedy against the gout.\r\n\r\n_Crab-eyes_ break the stone, and open stoppings of the bowels.\r\n\r\nThe lungs of a _Fox_, well dried, (but not burned) is an admirable\r\nstrengthener to the lungs: see the Lohoch of Fox lungs.\r\n\r\nThe liver of a _Duck_, stops fluxes, and strengthens the liver\r\nexceedingly.\r\n\r\nThe liver of a _Frog_, being dried and eaten, helps quartan agues, or\r\nas the vulgar call them, _third-day agues_.\r\n\r\n_Castoreum_ resists poison, the bitings of venomous beasts; it provokes\r\nthe menses, and brings forth birth and after-birth; it expels wind,\r\neases pains and aches, convulsions, sighings, lethargies; the smell of\r\nit allays the fits of the mother; inwardly given, it helps tremblings,\r\nfalling-sickness, and other such ill effects of the brain and nerves: A\r\nscruple is enough to take at a time, and indeed spirit of Castorium is\r\nbetter than Castorium, raw, to which I refer you.\r\n\r\nA _Sheep’s_ or _Goat’s_ bladder being burnt, and the ashes given\r\ninwardly, helps the _Diabetes_.\r\n\r\nA flayed _Mouse_ dried and beaten into powder, and given at a time,\r\nhelps such as cannot hold their water, or have a _Diabetes_, if you do\r\nthe like three days together.\r\n\r\n_Ivory_, or _Elephant’s tooth_, binds, stops the _Whites_, it\r\nstrengthens the heart and stomach, helps the yellow jaundice, and makes\r\nwomen fruitful.\r\n\r\nThose small bones which are found in the fore-feet of an _Hare_, being\r\nbeaten into powder and drank in wine, powerfully provoke urine.\r\n\r\n_Goose grease, and Capons grease_, are both softening, help gnawing\r\nsores, stiffness of the womb, and mitigate pain.\r\n\r\nI am of opinion that the suet of a _Goat_ mixed with a little saffron,\r\nis as excellent an ointment for the gout, especially the gout in the\r\nknees, as any is.\r\n\r\n_Bears grease_ stays the falling off of the hair.\r\n\r\n_Fox grease_ helps pains in the ears.\r\n\r\n_Elk’s Claws or hoofs_ are a sovereign remedy for the falling sickness,\r\nthough it be but worn in a ring, much more being taken inwardly; but\r\nsaith _Mizaldus_, it must be the hoof of the right foot behind.\r\n\r\n_Milk_ is an extreme windy meat; therefore I am of the opinion of\r\n_Dioscorides_, _viz._ that it is not profitable in head-aches; yet\r\nthis is for certain, that it is an admirable remedy for inward ulcers\r\nin any part of the body, or any corrosions, or excoriations, pains in\r\nthe reins and bladder: but it is very bad in diseases of the liver,\r\nspleen, the falling-sickness, vertigo, or dissiness in the head, fevers\r\nand head-aches; Goat’s milk is held to be better than Cow’s for Hectic\r\nfevers, phthisick, and consumptions, and so is Ass’s also.\r\n\r\n_Whey_, attenuates and cleanses both choler and melancholy:\r\nwonderfully helps melancholy and madness coming of it; opens stoppings\r\nof the bowels; helps such as have the dropsy and are troubled with the\r\nstoppings of the spleen, rickets and hypochondriac melancholy: for such\r\ndiseases you may make up your physic with whey. Outwardly it cleanses\r\nthe skin of such deformities as come through choler or melancholy, as\r\nscabs, itch, morphew, leprosies, &c.\r\n\r\n_Honey_ is of a gallant cleansing quality, exceeding profitable in all\r\ninward ulcers in what part of the body soever; it opens the veins,\r\ncleanses the reins and bladder. I know no vices belonging to it, but\r\nonly it is soon converted into choler.\r\n\r\n_Wax_, softens, heats, and meanly fills sores with flesh, it suffers\r\nnot the milk to curdle in women’s breasts; inwardly it is given (ten\r\ngrains at a time) against bloody-fluxes.\r\n\r\n_Raw-silk_, heats and dries, cheers the heart, drives away sadness,\r\ncomforts all the spirits, both natural, vital and animal.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BELONGING TO THE SEA.\r\n\r\n_Sperma Cœti_, is well applied outwardly to eating ulcers, the marks\r\nwhich the small pox leaves behind them; it clears the sight, provokes\r\nsweat; inwardly it troubles the stomach and belly, helps bruises,\r\nand stretching of the nerves, and therefore is good for women newly\r\ndelivered.\r\n\r\n_Amber-grease_, heats and dries, strengthens the brain and nerves\r\nexceedingly, if the infirmity of them come of cold, resists pestilence.\r\n\r\n_Sea-sand_, a man that hath the dropsy, being set up to the middle in\r\nit, it draws out all the water.\r\n\r\n_Red Coral_, is cold, dry and binding, stops the immoderate flowing of\r\nthe menses, bloody-fluxes, the running of the reins, and the Fluor\r\nAlbus, helps such as spit blood, it is an approved remedy for the\r\nfalling sickness. Also if ten grains of red Coral be given to a child\r\nin a little breast-milk so soon as it is born, before it take any other\r\nfood, it will never have the falling-sickness, nor convulsions. The\r\ncommon dose is from ten grains to thirty.\r\n\r\n_Pearls_, are a wonderful strengthener to the heart, encrease milk\r\nin nurses, and amend it being naught, they restore such as are in\r\nconsumptions; both they and the red Coral preserve the body in health,\r\nand resist fevers. The dose is ten grains or fewer; more, I suppose,\r\nbecause it is dear, than because it would do harm.\r\n\r\n_Amber_, (_viz._ yellow Amber) heats and dries, therefore prevails\r\nagainst moist diseases of the head; it helps violent coughs, helps\r\nconsumption of the lungs, spitting of blood, the Fluor Albus; it stops\r\nbleeding at the nose, helps difficulty of urine: You may take ten or\r\ntwenty grains at a time.\r\n\r\nThe Froth of the _Sea_, it is hot and dry, helps scabs, itch, and\r\nleprosy, scald heads, &c. it cleanses the skin, helps difficulty of\r\nurine, makes the teeth white, being rubbed with it, the head being\r\nwashed with it, it helps baldness, and trimly decks the head with hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n    METALS, MINERALS, AND\r\n    STONES.\r\n\r\nGOLD is temperate in quality, it wonderfully strengthens the heart and\r\nvital spirits, which one perceiving, very wittily inserted these verses:\r\n\r\n    For Gold is cordial; and that’s the reason,\r\n    Your raking Misers live so long a season.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is certain, in cordials, it resists melancholy,\r\nfaintings, swoonings, fevers, falling-sickness, and all such like\r\ninfirmities, incident either to the vital or animal spirit.\r\n\r\n_Alum._ Heats, binds, and purges; scours filthy ulcers, and fastens\r\nloose teeth.\r\n\r\n_Brimstone_, or flower of brimstone, which is brimstone refined, and\r\nthe better for physical uses; helps coughs and rotten flegm; outwardly\r\nin ointments it takes away leprosies, scabs, and itch; inwardly it\r\nhelps yellow jaundice, as also worms in the belly, especially being\r\nmixed with a little Salt-petre: it helps lethargies being snuffed up in\r\nthe nose.\r\n\r\n_Litharge_, both of gold and silver; binds and dries much, fills up\r\nulcers with flesh, and heals them.\r\n\r\n_Lead_ is of a cold dry earthly quality, of an healing nature; applied\r\nto the place it helps any inflammation, and dries up humours.\r\n\r\n_Pompholix_, cools, dries and binds.\r\n\r\n_Jacynth_, strengthens the heart being either beaten into powder, and\r\ntaken inwardly, or only worn in a ring.\r\n\r\n_Sapphire_, quickens the senses, helps such as are bitten by venomous\r\nbeasts, ulcers in the bowels.\r\n\r\n_Emerald_; called a chaste stone because it resists lust: being worn\r\nin a ring, it helps, or at least mitigates the falling sickness and\r\nvertigo; it strengthens the memory, and stops the unruly passions of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n_Ruby_ (or _carbuncle_, if there be such a stone) restrains lust;\r\nresists pestilence; takes away idle and foolish thoughts, makes men\r\ncheerful. _Cardanus._\r\n\r\n_Granite._ Strengthens the heart, but hurts the brain, causes anger,\r\ntakes away sleep.\r\n\r\n_Diamond_, is reported to make him that bears it unfortunate.\r\n\r\n_Amethist_, being worn, makes men sober and steady, keeps men from\r\ndrunkenness and too much sleep, it quickens the wit, is profitable in\r\nhuntings and fightings, and repels vapours from the head.\r\n\r\n_Bezoar_, is a notable restorer of nature, a great cordial, no way\r\nhurtful nor dangerous, is admirably good in fevers, pestilences, and\r\nconsumptions, _viz._ taken inwardly; for this stone is not used to be\r\nworn as a jewel; the powder of it put upon wounds made by venomous\r\nbeasts, draws out the poison.\r\n\r\n_Topaz_ (if _Epiphanius_ spake truth) if you put it into boiling\r\nwater, it doth so cool it that you may presently put your hands into\r\nit without harm; if so, then it cools inflammations of the body by\r\ntouching them.\r\n\r\n_Toadstone_; Being applied to the place helps the bitings of venomous\r\nbeasts, and quickly draws all the poison to it; it is known to be a\r\ntrue one by this; hold it near to any toad, and she will make proffer\r\nto take it away from you if it be right; else not. _Lemnius._\r\n\r\n_Nephritichus lapis_; helps pains in the stomach, and is of great force\r\nin breaking and bringing away the stone and gravel.\r\n\r\n_Jasper_; being worn, stops bleeding, eases the labour in women, stops\r\nlust, resists fevers and dropsies. _Mathiolus._\r\n\r\n_Atites_, or the stone with child, because being hollow in the middle,\r\nit contains another little stone within it, is found in an Eagle’s\r\nnest, and in many other places; this stone being bound to the left arm\r\nof women with child, stays their miscarriage or abortion, but when\r\nthe time of their labour comes, remove it from their arm, and bind it\r\nto the inside of their thigh, and it brings forth the child, and that\r\n(almost) without any pain at all. _Dioscorides, Pliny._\r\n\r\n_Lapis Lazuli_, purges melancholy being taken inwardly; outwardly worn\r\nas a jewel, it makes men cheerful, fortunate and rich.\r\n\r\nAnd thus I end the stones, the virtues of which if any think\r\nincredible, I answer; 1. I quoted the authors where I had them. 2. I\r\nknow nothing to the contrary but why it may be as possible as the sound\r\nof a trumpet is to incite a man to valour; or a fiddle to dancing: and\r\nif I have added a few simples which the Colledge left out, I hope my\r\nfault is not much, or at a leastwise, venial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    A CATALOGUE OF SIMPLES\r\n\r\n    IN THE\r\n\r\n    NEW DISPENSATORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ROOTS.\r\n\r\nCollege.] _Sorrel, Calamus Aromaticus, Water-flag, Privet, Garlick,\r\nMarsh-mallows, Alcanet, Angelica, Anthora, Smallage, Aron, Birth-wort\r\nlong and round, Sowbread, Reeds, Asarabacca, Virginian Snakeweed,\r\nSwall-wort, Asparagus, Asphodel, male and female.

It seems the college\r\nholds a strange opinion, viz. That it would do an Englishman a mischief\r\nto know what the herbs in his garden are good for.\r\n\r\nBut my opinion is, that those herbs, roots, plants, &c. which grow\r\nnear a man, are far better and more congruous to his nature than any\r\noutlandish rubbish whatsoever, and this I am able to give a reason\r\nof to any that shall demand it of me, therefore I am so copious in\r\nhandling of them, you shall observe them ranked in this order.\r\n\r\n1. The temperature of the roots, herbs, flowers, &c. _viz._ Hot, cold,\r\ndry, moist, together with the degree of each quality.\r\n\r\n2. What part of the body each root, herb, flower, is appropriated to,\r\n_viz._ head, throat, breast, heart, stomach, liver, spleen, bowels,\r\nreins, bladder, womb, joints, and in those which heat those places, and\r\nwhich cool them.\r\n\r\n3.

Of the Juices.\r\n    2. Of the Gums and Rosins.\r\n\r\n    _Concrete Juices, or Juices made thick, are either_\r\n\r\n_Temperate_, _as_, Juice of Liquorice, white starch.\r\n\r\n_Hot in the first degree._ Sugar.\r\n\r\n_In the second._ Labdanum.\r\n\r\n_In the third._ Benzoin, Assafœtida.\r\n\r\n_Cold in the third degree._ Sanguis Draconis, Acacia.\r\n\r\n_In the third._ Hypocistis.\r\n\r\n_In the fourth._ Opium, and yet some authors think Opium is hot because\r\nof its bitter taste.\r\n\r\n_Aloes and Manna_ purge choler gently; and Scamony doth purge choler\r\nviolently, that it is no ways fit for a vulgar man’s use, for it\r\ncorrodes the Bowels. Opopoanax purges flegm very gently.\r\n\r\n_White starch_ gently levigates or makes smooth such parts as are\r\nrough, syrup of Violets being made thick with it and so taken on the\r\npoint of a knife, helps coughs, roughness of the throat, wheezing,\r\nexcoriations of the bowels, the bloody-flux.\r\n\r\nJuice of _Liquorice_ helps roughness of the _Trachea Arteria_, which\r\nis in plain English called the windpipe, the roughness of which causes\r\ncoughs and hoarseness, difficulty of breathing, &c. It allays the heat\r\nof the stomach and liver, eases pains, soreness and roughness of the\r\nreins and bladder, it quencheth thirst, and strengthens the stomach\r\nexceedingly: It may easily be carried about in one’s pocket, and eat a\r\nlittle now and then.\r\n\r\n_Sugar_ cleanses and digests, takes away roughness of the tongue, it\r\nstrengthens the reins and bladder, being weakened: being beaten into\r\nfine powder and put into the eyes, it takes away films that grow over\r\nthe sight.\r\n\r\n_Labdanum_ is in operation, thickening, heating and mollifying, it\r\nopens the passage of the veins, and keeps the hair from falling off;\r\nthe use of it is usually external: being mixed with wine, myrrh, and\r\noil of mirtles, and applied like a plaister, it takes away filthy\r\nscars, and the deformity the small pox leaves behind them; being mixed\r\nwith oil of Roses, and dropped into the ears, it helps pains there;\r\nbeing used as a pessary, it provokes the menses, and helps hardness or\r\nstiffness of the womb. It is sometimes used inwardly in such medicines\r\nas ease pains and help the cough: if you mix a little of it with old\r\nwhite wine and drink it, it both provokes urine and stops looseness or\r\nfluxes.\r\n\r\n_Dragons blood_, cools, binds, and repels.\r\n\r\n_Acasia_, and _Hyposistis_, do the like.\r\n\r\nThe juice of _Maudlin_, or, for want of it Costmary, which is the same\r\nin effect, and better known to the vulgar, the juice is made thick for\r\nthe better keeping of it; first clarify the juice before you boil it to\r\nits due thickness, which is something thicker than honey.\r\n\r\nIt is appropriated to the liver, and the quantity of a dram taken\r\nevery morning, helps the _Cachexia_, or evil disposition of the\r\nbody proceeding from coldness of the liver: it helps the rickets\r\nand worms in children, provokes urine, and gently (without purging)\r\ndisburdens the body of choler and flegm; it succours the lungs, opens\r\nobstructions, and resists putrifaction of blood.\r\n\r\n_Gums are either temperate_, _as_, Lacca, Elemi, Tragacanth, &c.\r\n\r\n_Intemperate_, _and so are hot in the first degree_, as Bdellium, Gum\r\nof Ivy.\r\n\r\n_In the second_, Galbanum, Myrrh, Mastich, Frankincense, Olibanum,\r\nPitch, Rozin, Styrax.\r\n\r\n_In the third._ Amoniacum.\r\n\r\n_In the fourth._ Euphorbium.\r\n\r\nGum Arabick is cold.\r\n\r\nColophonia and Styrax soften.\r\n\r\nGum Arabick and Tragacanth, Sandarack or Juniper Gum, and Sarcocolla\r\nbind.\r\n\r\nGum of Cherry trees, breaks the stone.\r\n\r\nStyrax provokes the menses.\r\n\r\nOpopanax gently purges flegm.\r\n\r\nFrom the prickly _Cedar_ when it is burned comes forth that which, with\r\nus, is usually known by the name of Tar, and is excellently good for\r\nunction either for scabs, itch, or manginess, either in men or beasts,\r\nas also against the leprosy, tetters, ringworms, and scald heads.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of _Rozins_ fill up hollow ulcers, and relieve the body sore\r\npressed with cold griefs.\r\n\r\nThe _Rozin_ of Pitch-tree, is that which is commonly called Burgundy\r\npitch, and is something hotter and sharper than the former, being\r\nspread upon a cloth is excellently good for old aches coming of former\r\nbruises or dislocations.\r\n\r\n_Pitch_ mollifies hard swellings, and brings boils and sores to\r\nsuppuration, it breaks carbuncles, disperses aposthumes, cleanses\r\nulcers of corruption and fills them with flesh.\r\n\r\n_Bdellium_ heats and mollifies, and that very temperately, being mixed\r\nwith any convenient ointment or plaister, it helps kernels in the neck\r\nand throat, _Scrophula_, or that disease which was called the King’s\r\nEvil. Inwardly taken in any convenient medicine, it provokes the\r\nmenses, and breaks the stone, it helps coughs and bitings of venomous\r\nbeasts: it helps windiness of the spleen, and pains in the sides thence\r\ncoming. Both outwardly applied to the place and inwardly taken, it\r\nhelps ruptures or such as are burst, it softens the hardness of the\r\nwomb, dries up the moisture thereof and expels the dead child.\r\n\r\n_Bitumen Jadaicum_ is a certain dry pitch which the dead sea, or lake\r\nof _Sodom in India_ casts forth at certain times, the inhabitants\r\nthereabouts pitch their ships with it. It is of excellent use to\r\nmollify the hardness of swellings and discuss them, as also against\r\ninflammations; the smoke of it burnt is excellently good for the fits\r\nof the mother, and the falling-sickness: Inwardly taken in wine\r\nit provokes the menses, helps the bitings of venomous beasts, and\r\ndissolves congealed blood in the body.\r\n\r\n_Ambergreese_ is hot and dry in the second degree, I will not dispute\r\nwhether it be a Gum or not: It strengthens nature much which way\r\nsoever it be taken, there are but few grains usually given of it at a\r\ntime: mixed with a little ointment of Orange flowers, and the temples\r\nand forehead anointed with it, it eases the pains of the head and\r\nstrengthens the brain exceedingly; the same applied to the privities,\r\nhelps the fits of the mother; inwardly taken it strengthens the brain\r\nand memory, the heart and vital spirit, warms cold stomachs, and is\r\nan exceeding strengthener of nature to old people, adding vigour to\r\ndecayed and worn-out spirits: it provokes venery, and makes barren\r\nwomen fruitful, if coldness and moisture or weakness be the cause\r\nimpediting.\r\n\r\n_Assafœtida_ being smelled to, is vulgarly known to repress the fits of\r\nthe mother; a little bit put into an aching tooth, presently eases the\r\npain, ten grains of it taken before dinner, walking half an hour after\r\nit, provokes appetite, helps digestion, strengthens the stomach, and\r\ntakes away loathing of meat, it provokes lust exceedingly and expels\r\nwind as much.\r\n\r\n_Borax_, besides the virtues it has to solder Gold, Silver, Copper, &c.\r\ninwardly given in small quantities, it stops fluxes, and the running of\r\nthe reins: being in fine powder, and put into green wounds, it cures\r\nthem at once dressing.\r\n\r\n_Gambuge_, which the College calls _Gutta Gamba_. I know no good of it.\r\n\r\n_Caranna_ outwardly applied, is excellent for aches and swellings in\r\nthe nerves and joints: If you lay it behind the ears, it draws back\r\nhumours from the eyes; applied to the temples as they usually do\r\nMastich, it helps the tooth-ache.\r\n\r\n_Gum Elimi_, authors appropriate to fractures in the skull and head.\r\nSee _Arceus’_ liniment.\r\n\r\n_Gum Lacca_ being well purified, and the quantity of half a dram taken\r\nin any convenient liquor, strengthens the stomach and liver, opens\r\nobstructions, helps the yellow jaundice and dropsy; provokes urine,\r\nbreaks the stone in the reins and bladder.\r\n\r\nLiquid _Amber_ is not much unlike liquid _Styrax_: by unction it warms\r\nand comforts a cold and moist brain, it eases all griefs coming of\r\na cold cause, it mightily comforts and strengthens a weak stomach,\r\nbeing anointed with it, and helps digestion exceedingly, it dissolves\r\nswellings. It is hot in the third degree, and moist in the first.\r\n\r\nI think it would do the commonwealth no harm if I should speak a word\r\nor two on _Manna_ here, although it be no Gum: I confess authors make\r\nsome flutter about it, what it is, some holding it to be the juice\r\nof a tree; I am confident it is the very same condensated that our\r\nhoney-dews here are, only the contries whence it comes being far\r\nhotter, it falls in great abundance. Let him that desires reason for\r\nit, be pleased to read _Butler’s_ book of Bees, a most excellent\r\nexperimental work, there he shall find reason enough to satisfy any\r\nreasonable man. Choose the driest and whitest; it is a very gentle\r\npurger of choler, quenches thirst, provokes appetite, eases the\r\nroughness of the throat, helps bitterness in the throat, and often\r\nproneness to vomit, it is very good for such as are subject to be\r\ncostive to put it into their drink instead of sugar, it hath no\r\nobnoxious quality at all in it, but may be taken by a pregnant woman\r\nwithout any danger; a child of a year old may take an ounce of it at\r\na time dissolved in milk, it will melt like sugar, neither will it be\r\nknown from it by the taste.\r\n\r\n_Myrrh_ is hot and dry in the second degree, dangerous for pregnant\r\nwomen, it is bitter, and yet held to be good for the roughness of\r\nthe throat and wind-pipe; half a dram of it taken at a time helps\r\nrheumatic distillations upon the lungs, pains in the sides; it stops\r\nfluxes, provokes the menses, brings away both birth and after-birth,\r\nsoftens the hardness of the womb; being taken two hours before the\r\nfit comes, it helps agues. _Mathiolus_ saith he seldom used any other\r\nmedicine for the quartan ague than a dram of myrrh given in Muskadel\r\nan hour before the fit usually came; if you make it up into pills with\r\ntreacle, and take one of them every morning fasting, it is a sovereign\r\npreservative against the pestilence, against the poison of serpents,\r\nand other venomous beasts; a singular remedy for a stinking breath if\r\nit arise from putrefaction of the stomach, it fastens loose teeth, and\r\nstays the shedding off of the hair, outwardly used it breeds flesh in\r\ndeep wounds, and covers the naked bones with flesh.\r\n\r\n_Olibanum_ is hot in the second degree, and dry in the first, you may\r\ntake a dram of it at a time, it stops looseness and the running of\r\nthe reins; it strengthens the memory exceedingly, comforts the heart,\r\nexpels sadness and melancholy, strengthens the heart, helps coughs,\r\nrheums and pleurises; your best way (in my opinion,) to take it is to\r\nmix it with conserve of roses, and take it in the morning fasting.\r\n\r\n_Tachamacha_ is seldom taken inwardly, outwardly spread upon leather,\r\nand applied to the navel; it stays the fits of the mother, applied to\r\nthe side, it mitigates speedily, and in little time quite takes away\r\nthe pain and windiness of the spleen; the truth is, whatsoever ache\r\nor swelling proceeds of wind or cold raw humours, I know no better\r\nplaister coming from beyond sea than this gum. It strengthens the\r\nbrain and memory exceedingly, and stops all such defluctions thence as\r\ntrouble the eyes, ears, or teeth, it helps the gout and sciatica.\r\n\r\n_Gum Coopal, and Gum Anime_, are very like one another both in body and\r\noperation, the former is hard to come by, the last not very easy. It\r\nstops defluctions from the head, if you perfume your cap with the smoke\r\nof it, it helps the headache and megrim, strengthens the brain, and\r\ntherefore the sinews.\r\n\r\n_Gum Tragaganth_, which the vulgar call Gum Dragon, being mixed with\r\npectoral Syrups, (which you shall find noted in their proper places)\r\nit helps coughs and hoarseness, salt and sharp distillations upon the\r\nlungs, being taken with a liquorice stick, being dissolved in sweet\r\nwine, it helps (being drank) gnawing in the bowels, sharpness and\r\nfreetings of the urine, which causes excoriations either in the reins\r\nor bladder, being dissolved in milk and the eyes washed with it, it\r\ntakes away weals and scabs that grow on the eyelids, it is excellently\r\ngood to be put in poultice to fodder wounds, especially if the nerves\r\nor sinews be hurt.\r\n\r\n_Sagapen_, dissolved in juice of rue and taken, wonderfully breaks the\r\nstone in the bladder, expels the dead child and afterbirth, clears\r\nthe sight; dissolved in wine and drank, it helps the cough, and\r\ndistillation upon the lungs, and the fits of the mother; outwardly\r\nin oils or ointments, it helps such members as are out of joint or\r\nover-stretched.\r\n\r\n_Galbanum_ is of the same operation, and also taken from the same\r\nplant, _viz._ Fennel, Giant.\r\n\r\n_Gum Arabic_, thickens and cools, and corrects choleric sharp humours\r\nin the body, being dissolved in the white of an egg, well beaten, it\r\nhelps burnings, and keeps the place from blistering.\r\n\r\n_Mastich_ stays fluxes, being taken inwardly any way. Three or four\r\nsmall grains of Mastich, swallowed at night going to bed, is a remedy\r\nfor pains in the stomach, being beaten into powder, and mixed with\r\nconserve of Roses, it strengthens the stomach, stops distillations\r\nupon the lungs, stay, vomiting, and causes a sweet breath; being mixed\r\nwith white wine and the mouth washed with it, it cleanses the gums of\r\ncorruption, and fastens loose teeth.\r\n\r\n_Frankincense_ being used outwardly in the way of a plaister, heats and\r\nbinds; being applied to the temples, stops the rheums that flow to the\r\neyes, helps green wounds, and fills hollow ulcers with flesh, stops\r\nthe bleeding of wounds, though the arteries be cut; being made into an\r\nointment with Vinegar and Hog’s-grease, helps the itch, pains in the\r\nears, inflammations in women’s breasts commonly called agues in the\r\nbreast; beware of taking it inwardly, lest it cause madness.\r\n\r\n_Turpentine_ is hot in the second degree, it heals, softens, it\r\ndiscusses and purges, cleanses the reins, provokes urine.\r\n\r\n_Styrax Calamitis_ is hot and dry in the second degree, it heals,\r\nmollifies, and concocts; being taken inwardly helps the cough, and\r\ndistillations of the lungs, hoarseness and loss of voice, helps the\r\nhardness of the womb, and provokes the menses.\r\n\r\n_Ammoniacum_, hot and dry in the third degree, softens, draws, and\r\nheats; being dissolved in vinegar, strained and applied plaister-wise,\r\nit takes away carbuncles and hardness in the flesh, it is one of the\r\nbest remedies that I know for infirmities of the spleen, being applied\r\nto the left side; being made into an ointment with oil, it is good to\r\nanoint the limbs of such as are weary: a scruple of it being taken in\r\nthe form of a pill loosens the belly, gives speedy delivery to women in\r\ntravail, helps diseases of the spleen, the sciatica and all pains in\r\nthe joints, and have any humour afflicting their breast.\r\n\r\n_Camphire_, it is held by all authority to be cold and dry in the\r\nthird degree, it is of very thin subtile parts, insomuch that being\r\nbeaten into very fine powder it will vanquish away into the air,\r\nbeing beaten into powder and mixed with oil, and the temples anointed\r\ntherewith, eases headaches proceeding of heat, all inflammations\r\nwhatsoever, the back being anointed with the same, cools the reins,\r\nand seminal vessels, stops the running of the reins and Fluor Albus,\r\nthe moderate use of Venery, the like it doth if it be drank inwardly\r\nwith Bettony-water, take but a small quantity of it at a time inwardly,\r\nit resist poison and bitings by venomous beasts; outwardly, applied\r\nas before, and the eyes anointed with it, stops hot rheums that flow\r\nthither.\r\n\r\n_Opopanax_ purges thick flegm from the most remote parts of the body,\r\n_viz._ the brain, joints, hands, and feet, the nerves and breast, and\r\nstrengthens all those parts when they are weak, if the weakness proceed\r\nof cold, as usually it doth; it helps weakness of the sight, old rotten\r\ncoughs, and gouts of all sorts, dropsies, and swellings of the spleen,\r\nit helps the stranguary and difficulty of making urine, provokes the\r\nmenses, and helps all cold afflictions of the womb; have a care you\r\ngive it not to any pregnant women. The dose is one dram at most,\r\ncorrected with a little Mastich, dissolved in Vinegar and outwardly\r\napplied helps the passions of the spleen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    In the next place the College tells you a tale concerning\r\n    Liquid, Juices, and Tears, which are to be kept for present\r\n    use, _viz._\r\n\r\nCollege.] _Vinegar, Juice of Citrons, Juice of sour Grapes, Oranges,\r\nBarberries, Tears of a Birch-tree, Juice of Cherries, Quinces,\r\nPomegranates, Lemons, Wood-sorrel, Oil of unripe Olives, and ripe\r\nOlives, both new and old, Juice of red and Damask Roses, Wine Tears of\r\na Vine._\r\n\r\n_Culpeper._] The virtues of the most of these may be found in the\r\nSyrups, and are few of them used alone.\r\n\r\n       *

Moss, Viscus Quercinus, Oak, Apples._\r\n\r\n_Culpeper._] As the College would have you know this, so would I know\r\nwhat the chief of them are good for.\r\n\r\n_Jew’s-ears_ boiled in milk and drank, helps sore throats.\r\n\r\n_Moss_ is cold, dry, and binding, therefore good for fluxes of all\r\nsorts.\r\n\r\n_Misleto of the Oak_, it helps the falling sickness and the\r\nconvulsions; being discreetly gathered and used.\r\n\r\n_Oak Apples_ are dry and binding; being boiled in milk and drank, they\r\nstop fluxes and the menses, and being boiled in vinegar, and the body\r\nanointed with the vinegar, cures the itch.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Then the College acquaints you, That there are certain\r\n    living Creatures called\r\n\r\nCollege.] _Bees, Woodlice, Silkworms, Toads, Crabs of the River, little\r\nPuppy Dogs, Grass-hoppers, Cantharides, Cothanel, Hedge-hogs, Emmets\r\nor Ants, Larks, Swallows, and their young ones, Horse-leeches,

Foxes._\r\n\r\n_Culpeper._] That part of this crew of Cattle and some others which\r\nthey have not been pleased to learn, may be made beneficial to your\r\nsick bodies, be pleased to understand, that\r\n\r\n_Bees_ being burnt to ashes, and a lye made with the ashes, trimly\r\ndecks a bald head being washed with it.\r\n\r\n_Snails_ with shells on their backs, being first washed from the dirt,\r\nthen the shells broken, and they boiled in spring water, but not\r\nscummed at all, for the scum will sink of itself, and the water drank\r\nfor ordinary drink is a most admirable remedy for consumption; being\r\nbruised and applied to the place they help the gout, draw thorns out of\r\nthe flesh, and held to the nose help the bleeding thereof.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *

dryer, &c. or if they be full of Juice, by distilling the\r\n    juice in a convenient bath, that so burning may be avoided,\r\n    which hitherto hath seldom been. But let the other Herbs,\r\n    Flowers, or Roots, be bruised, and by adding Tartar, common\r\n    salt, or leven be digested, then putting spring water to\r\n    them, distil them in an Alembick with its refrigeratory, or\r\n    Worm, till the change of the taste shew the virtue to be\r\n    drawn off; then let the oil (if any) be separated from the\r\n    water according to art.\r\n\r\nInto the number of these waters may be ascribed.\r\n\r\nThe Tears of Vines, the liquor of the Birch-tree, May dew.\r\n\r\n_Culpeper._] That my country may receive the benefit of these waters,\r\nI shall first shew the temperatures, secondly, the virtues of the\r\nmost usual and most easy to come by: If any should take exceptions\r\nthat I mention not all, I answer first, I mention enough.

SPIRIT AND COMPOUND\r\n    DISTILLED WATERS.\r\n\r\n_Culpeper._] Before I begin these, I thought good to premise a few\r\nwords: They are all hot in operation, and therefore not to be meddled\r\nwith by people of hot constitutions when they are in health, for fear\r\nof fevers and adustion of blood, but for people of cold constitutions,\r\nas melancholy and flegmatic people. If they drink of them moderately\r\nnow and then for recreation, due consideration being had to the part\r\nof the body which is weakest, they may do them good: yet in diseases\r\nof melancholy, neither strong waters nor sack is to be drank, for they\r\nmake the humour thin, and then up to the head it flies, where it fills\r\nthe brain with foolish and fearful imaginations.\r\n\r\n2. Let all young people forbear them whilst they are in health, for\r\ntheir blood is usually hot enough without them.\r\n\r\n3. Have regard to the season of the year, so shall you find them more\r\nbeneficial in Summer than in Winter, because in summer the body is\r\nalways coldest within, and digestion weakest, and that is the reason\r\nwhy men and women eat less in Summer than in Winter.\r\n\r\nThus much for people in health, which drink strong waters for\r\nrecreation.\r\n\r\nAs for the medicinal use of them, it shall be shewed at the latter\r\nend of every receipt, only in general they are (due respect had to\r\nthe humours afflicting, and part of the body afflicted) medicinal for\r\ndiseases of cold and flegm, chilliness of the spirits, &c.\r\n\r\nBut that my countrymen may not be mistaken in this, I shall give them\r\nsome symptoms of each complexion how a man may know when it exceeds its\r\ndue limits.\r\n\r\n    _Signs of choler abounding._\r\n\r\nLeanness of body, costiveness, hollow eyes, anger without a cause, a\r\ntesty disposition, yellowness of the skin, bitterness in the throat,\r\npricking pains in the head, the pulse swifter and stronger than\r\nordinary, the urine higher coloured, thinner and brighter, troublesome\r\nsleeps, much dreaming of fire, lightning, anger, and fighting.\r\n\r\n    _Signs of blood abounding._\r\n\r\nThe veins are bigger (or at least they seem so) and fuller then\r\nordinary; the skin is red, and as it were swollen; pricking pains in\r\nthe sides, and about the temples, shortness of breath, head-ache, the\r\npulse great and full, urine high coloured and thick, dreams of blood,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n    _Signs of melancholy abounding._\r\n\r\nFearfulness without a cause, fearful and foolish imaginations, the skin\r\nrough and swarthy, leanness, want of sleep, frightful dreams, sourness\r\nin the throat, the pulse very weak, solitariness, thin clear urine,\r\noften sighing, &c.\r\n\r\n    _Signs of flegm abounding._\r\n\r\nSleepiness, dulness, slowness, heaviness, cowardliness, forgetfulness,\r\nmuch spitting, much superfluities at the nose, little appetite to meat\r\nand as bad digestion, the skin whiter, colder and smoother than it was\r\nwant to be; the pulse slow and deep: the urine thick and low coloured:\r\ndreams of rain, floods, and water, &c.\r\n\r\nThese things thus premised, I come to the matter.\r\n\r\nThe first the College presents you with, is\r\n\r\n    _Spiritus et Aqua Absinthis minus Composita._\r\n\r\nOr, Spirit and water of Wormwood, the lesser composition.\r\n\r\n_College._] Take of the leaves of dryed Wormwood two pounds, Annis\r\nseeds, half a pound: steep them in six gallons of small wine twenty\r\nfour hours, then distil them in an Alembick, adding to every pound of\r\nthe distilled water two ounces of the best Sugar.\r\n\r\nLet the two first pound you draw out be called Spirit of Wormwood,\r\nthose which follow, Wormwood water the lesser composition.\r\n\r\n_Culpeper._] I like this distinction of the College very well, because\r\nwhat is first stilled out, is far stronger than the rest, and therefore\r\nvery fitting to be kept by itself: you may take which you please,\r\naccording as the temperature of your body, either to heat or cold, and\r\nthe season of year requires.\r\n\r\nIt hath the same virtues Wormwood hath, only fitter to be used by such\r\nwhose bodies are chilled by age, and whose natural heat abates. You\r\nmay search the herbs for the virtues, it heats the stomach, and helps\r\ndigestion.\r\n\r\n_The College._] After the same manner (only omitting the Annis seeds)\r\nis distilled spirit and water of Angelica, both Herb and Root, Bawm,\r\nMints, Sage, &c. the Flowers of Rosemary, Clary, Clove-gilliflowers,\r\n&c. the seeds of Caraway, &c. Juniper-berries, Orange Pills, Lemons,\r\nCitrons, &c. Cinnamon, Nutmegs, &c.\r\n\r\n    _Spiritus et Aqua Absynthii magis composita._\r\n\r\nOr spirit and water of Wormwood, the greater composition.\r\n\r\n_The College._] Take of common and Roman Wormwood, of each a pound;\r\nSage, Mints, Bawm, of each two handfuls; the Roots of Galanga, Ginger,\r\nCalamus, Aromaticus, Elecampane, of each three drachms; Liquorice, an\r\nounce, Raisins of the Sun stoned, three ounces, Annis seeds, and sweet\r\nFennel seeds, of each three drachms; Cinnamon, Cloves, Nutmegs, of each\r\ntwo drachms; Cardamoms, Cubebs, of each one drachm: let the things\r\nbe cut that are to be cut, and the things be bruised that are to be\r\nbruised, all of them infused in twenty four pints of Spanish wine, for\r\ntwenty four hours, then, distilled in an Alembick, adding two ounces of\r\nwhite sugar to every pint of distilled water.\r\n\r\nLet the first pint be called Spirit of Wormwood the greater composition.\r\n\r\n_Culpeper._] The opinion of Authors is, That it heats the stomach,\r\nand strengthens it and the lungs, expels wind, and helps digestion in\r\nancient people.\r\n\r\n    _Spiritus et Aqua Angelica magis composita._\r\n\r\nOr Spirit and water of Angelica, the greater composition.\r\n\r\n_The College._] Take of the leaves of Angelica eight ounces, of Carduus\r\nBenedictus six ounces, of Bawm and Sage, of each four ounces, Angelica\r\nseeds six ounces; sweet Fennel seeds nine ounces. Let the herbs, being\r\ndryed, and the seeds be grossly bruised, to which add of the species\r\ncalled Aromaticum Rosarum; and of the species called Diamoschu Dulce,\r\nof each an ounce and a half, infuse them two days in thirty two pints\r\nof Spanish Wine, then distil them with a gentle fire, and with every\r\npound mix two ounces of sugar dissolved in Rose-water.\r\n\r\nLet the three first pounds be called by the name of Spirit, the rest by\r\nthe name of water.\r\n\r\n_Culpeper._] The chief end of composing this medicine, was to\r\nstrengthen the heart and resist infection, and therefore is very\r\nwholesome in pestilential times, and for such as walk in stinking air.\r\n\r\nI shall now quote you their former receipt in their former dispensatory.\r\n\r\n    _Angelica water the greater composition._\r\n\r\n_The College._] Take of Angelica two pounds, Annis seed half a pound,\r\nCoriander and Caraway seeds, of each four ounces, Zedoary bruised,\r\nthree ounces: steep them twenty four hours in six gallons of small\r\nwine, then draw out the spirit, and sweeten it with sugar.\r\n\r\n_Culpeper._] It comforts the heart, cherishes the vital spirits,\r\nresists the pestilence, and all corrupt airs, which indeed are the\r\nnatural causes of epidemical diseases, the sick may take a spoonful\r\nof it in any convenient cordial, and such as are in health, and have\r\nbodies either cold by nature, or cooled by age, may take as much either\r\nin the morning fasting, or a little before meat.\r\n\r\n    _Spiritus Lavendula compositus Matthiæ._\r\n    Or compound spirit of Lavender. Matthias.\r\n\r\n_The College._] Take of Lavender flowers one gallon, to which pour\r\nthree gallons of the best spirits of wine, let them stand together\r\nin the sun six days, then distil them with an Alembick with this\r\nrefrigeratory.\r\n\r\nTake of the flowers of Sage, Rosemary, and Bettony, of each one\r\nhandful; the flowers of Borrage, Bugloss, Lilies of the Valley,\r\nCowslips, of each two handfuls: let the flowers be newly and seasonably\r\ngathered, being infused in one gallon of the best spirits of wine,\r\nand mingled with the foregoing spirit of Lavender flowers, adding\r\nthe leaves of Bawm, Feather-few, and Orange tree fresh gathered; the\r\nflowers of Stœchas and Orange tree, Bay berries, of each one ounce.\r\nAfter convenient digestion distil it again, after which add Citron\r\npills the outward bark, Peony seed husked, of each six drams, cinnamon,\r\nMace, Nutmegs, Cardamoms, Cubebs, yellow Sanders, of each half an\r\nounce, Wood of Aloes one dram, the best Jujubes, the stones being taken\r\nout, half a pound, digest them six weeks, then strain it and filter it,\r\nand add to it prepared Pearls two drams, Emeralds prepared a scruple,\r\nAmbergrease, Musk, Saffron, of each half a scruple, red Roses dryed,\r\nred Sanders, of each half an ounce, yellow Sanders, Citron Pills,\r\ndryed, of each one dram. Let the species being tyed up in a rag, be\r\nhung into the aforementioned spirit.\r\n\r\n_Culpeper._] I could wish the Apothecaries would desire to be certified\r\nby the College.\r\n\r\n1. Whether the gallon of Lavender flowers must be filled by heap,\r\nor by strike. 2. Next, whether the flowers must be pressed down\r\nin the measure or not. 3. How much must be drawn off in the first\r\ndistillation. 4. Where they should get Orange leaves and flowers fresh\r\ngathered. 5. What they mean by _convenient digestion_. 6. Where you\r\nshall find Borrage, Bugloss, and Cowslips, flowering together, that\r\nso you may have them all fresh according to their prescript, the one\r\nflowering in the latter end of April, and beginning of May, the other\r\nin the end of June, and beginning of July. 7. If they can make a shift\r\nto make it, how, or which way the virtues of it will countervail the\r\none half of the charge and cost, to leave the pains and trouble out.\r\n\r\n    _Spiritus Castorii._\r\n    Or Spirit of Castoreum.\r\n\r\n_The College._] Take of fresh Castoreum four ounces, Lavender flower\r\nan ounce, the tops of Sage and Rosemary, of each half an ounce,\r\nCinnamon six drams, Mace, Cloves, of each two drachms, spirits of Wine\r\nrectified, six pounds, digest them in a phial filled only to the third\r\npart, close stopped with cork and bladder in warm ashes for two days,\r\nthen distilled in Balneo Mariæ, and the distilled water kept close\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n_Culpeper._] By reason of its heat it is no ways fit to be taken alone,\r\nbut mixed with other convenient medicines appropriated to the diseases\r\nyou would give it for, it resists poison, and helps such as are bitten\r\nby venomous beasts: it causes speedy delivery to women in travail, and\r\ncasteth out the Placenta: it helps the fits of the mother, lethargies\r\nand convulsions, being mixed with white wine, and dropped into the\r\nears, it helps deafness; if stopping be the cause of it, the dose to be\r\ngiven inwardly is between one dram, and half a dram, according to the\r\nstrength and age of the patient.\r\n\r\n    _Aqua Petasitidis composita._\r\n    Or, compound water of Butter-bur.\r\n\r\n_The College._] Take of the fresh roots of Butter-bur bruised, one\r\npound and a half, the roots of Angelica and Masterwort, of each half a\r\npound, steep them in ten pints of strong Ale, then distil them till the\r\nchange of the taste gives a testimony that the strength is drawn out.\r\n\r\n_Culpeper._] This water is very effectual being mixed with other\r\nconvenient cordials, for such as have pestilential fevers: also a\r\nspoonful taken in the morning, may prove a good preservative in\r\npestilential times: it helps the fits of the mother, and such as are\r\nshort winded, and being taken inwardly, dries up the moisture of such\r\nsores as are hard to be cured.\r\n\r\n    _Aqua Raphani Composita._\r\n    Or Compound water of Radishes.\r\n\r\n_The College._] Take of the leaves of both sorts of Scurvy-grass, of\r\neach six pound, having bruised them, press the juice out of them, with\r\nwhich mix of the juice of brooklime, and Water-cresses, of each one\r\npound and a half, of the best white wine, eight pounds, twelve whole\r\nLemons, pills and all, fresh Briony roots four pound, the roots of wild\r\nRadishes two pound, Captain Winter’s Cinnamon half a pound, Nutmegs\r\nfour ounces, steep them altogether, and then distil them.\r\n\r\n_Culpeper._] I fancy it not, and so I leave it;

Of the extract you may take ten grains at a\r\ntime, or somewhat more, if your body be not feverish, half a spoonful\r\nof water is sufficient at a time, and that mixed with other cordials or\r\nmedicines appropriated to the disease that troubles you.\r\n\r\n    _Aqua et Spiritus Lambricorum, magistralis._\r\n    Or Water and Spirit of Earthworms.\r\n\r\n_College._] Take of Earthworms well cleansed, three pound, Snails, with\r\nshells on their backs cleansed, two gallons, beat them in a mortar, and\r\nput them into a convenient vessel, adding stinging Nettles, roots and\r\nall, six handfuls, wild Angelica, four handfuls, brank Ursine, seven\r\nhandfuls, Agrimony, Bettony, of each three handfuls, Rue one handful,\r\ncommon Wormwood two handfuls, Rosemary flowers six ounces, Dock roots\r\nten ounces, the roots of Sorrel five ounces, Turmerick, the inner bark\r\nof Barberries, of each four ounces, Fenugreek seeds two ounces, Cloves\r\nthree ounces, Hart’s-horn, Ivory in gross powder, of each four ounces,\r\nSaffron three drams, small spirits of Wine four gallons and a half,\r\nafter twenty-four hours infusion, distil them in an alembick.

If there be no fever, you may take a spoonful by\r\nitself; if there be, you may, if you please, mix it with some cooler\r\nmedicine appropriated to the same use you would give it for.\r\n\r\n    _Aqua Gilbertii._\r\n    Or Gilbert’s Water.\r\n\r\n_College._] Take of Scabious, Burnet, Dragons, Bawm, Angelica,\r\nPimpernel, with purple flowers, Tormentil, roots and all, of each two\r\nhandfuls, let all of them, being rightly gathered and prepared, be\r\nsteeped in four gallons of Canary Wine, still off three gallons in an\r\nalembick, to which add three ounces of each of the cordial flowers,\r\nClove-gilliflowers six ounces, Saffron half an ounce, Turmerick two\r\nounces, Galanga, Bazil seeds, of each one dram, Citron pills one\r\nounce, the seed of Citrons and Carduus, Cloves of each five ounces,\r\nHart’s-horn four ounces, steep them twenty four hours and then distil\r\nthem in _Balneo Mariæ_: to the distilled water add Pearls prepared,\r\nan ounce and a half, red Coral, Crabs eyes, white Amber, of each\r\ntwo drams, Crabs claws, six drams, Bezoar, Ambergrease, of each two\r\nscruples, steep them six weeks in the sun, in a vessel well stopped,\r\noften shaking it, then filter it, (you may keep the powders for\r\nSpicord. temp.) by mixing twelve ounces of Sugar candy, with six\r\nounces of red Rose-water, and four ounces of spirit of Cinnamon with it.\r\n\r\n_Culpeper._] I suppose this was invented for a cordial to strengthen\r\nthe heart, to relieve languishing nature. It is exceeding dear.

Besides, Vinegars are often, nay, most commonly used\r\nexternally, viz. to bathe the place, then look amongst the simples,\r\nand see what place of the body the simple is appropriated to, and you\r\ncannot but know both what Vinegar to use, and to what place to apply it.\r\n\r\n    _Acetum Scilliticum._\r\n    Or Vinegar of Squils.\r\n\r\n_College._] Take of that part of the Squill which is between the\r\noutward bark and the bottom, cut in thin slices, and placed thirty or\r\nforty days in the sun or some remiss heat, then a pound of them (being\r\ncut small with a knife made of ivory or some white wood) being put in\r\na vessel, and six pounds of Vinegar put to them; set the vessel, being\r\nclose stopped, in the sun thirty or forty days, afterwards strain it,\r\nand keep it for use.\r\n\r\n_Culpeper._] A little of this medicine being taken in the morning\r\nfasting, and walking half an hour after, preserves the body in health,\r\nto extreme old age, (as _Sanius_ tried, who using no other medicine but\r\nthis, lived in perfect health till one hundred and seventeen years of\r\nage) it makes the digestion good, a long wind, a clear voice, an acute\r\nsight, a good colour, it suffers no offensive thing to remain in the\r\nbody, neither wind, flegm, choler, melancholy, dung, nor urine, but\r\nbrings them forth; it brings forth filth though it lie in the bones, it\r\ntakes away salt and sour belchings, though a man be never so licentious\r\nin diet, he shall feel no harm: It hath cured such as have the\r\nphthisic, that have been given over by all Physicians: It cures such\r\nas have the falling sickness, gouts, and diseases and swellings of the\r\njoints: It takes away the hardness of the liver and spleen. We should\r\nnever have done if we should reckon up the particular benefits of this\r\nmedicine: Therefore we commend it as a wholesome medicine for soundness\r\nof body, preservation of health, and vigour of mind.

A Syrup is a medicine\r\nof a liquid body, compounded of Decoction, Infusion, or Juice, with\r\nSugar or Honey, and brought by the heat of the fire, into the thickness\r\nof Honey. 2. Because all Honey is not of a thickness, understand new\r\nHoney, which of all other is thinnest. 3. The reason why Decoctions,\r\nInfusions, Juices, are thus used, is, Because thereby, First, They will\r\nkeep the longer. Secondly, They will taste the better. 4. In boiling\r\nSyrups have a great care of their just consistence, for if you boil\r\nthem too much they will candy, if too little, they will sour. 5. All\r\nsimple Syrups have the virtues of the simples they are made of, and are\r\nfar more convenient for weak people, and delicate stomachs.\r\n\r\n    _Syrupus de Absinthio simplex._\r\n    Or Syrup of Wormwood simple.\r\n\r\n_The College._] Take of the clarified Juice of common Wormwood,\r\nclarified Sugar, of each four pounds, make it into a Syrup according\r\nto art.

If you take it as a preparative for an\r\nemetic, take half an ounce of it when you go to bed the night before\r\nyou intend it to operate, it will work the easier, but if for any of\r\nthe foregoing occasions, take it with a liquorice stick.\r\n\r\n    _Syrupus Acetosus compositus._\r\n    Or Syrup of Vinegar compound.\r\n\r\n_College._] Take of the roots of Smallage, Fennel, Endive, of each\r\nthree ounces, the seeds of Annis, Smallage, Fennel, of each one ounce,\r\nof Endive half an ounce, clear Water six pounds, boil it gently in an\r\nearthen vessel till half the water be consumed, then strain and clarify\r\nit, and with three pounds of Sugar, and a pound and a half of white\r\nWine Vinegar, boil it into a Syrup.\r\n\r\n_Culpeper._] This in my opinion is a gallant Syrup for such whose\r\nbodies are stuffed either with flegm, or tough humours, for it opens\r\nobstructions or stoppings both of the stomach, liver, spleen, and\r\nreins; it cuts and brings away tough flegm and choler, and is therefore\r\na special remedy for such as have a stuffing at their stomach.\r\n\r\n    _Syrupus de Agno Casto._\r\n    Or Syrup of Agnus Castus.\r\n\r\n_College._] Take of the seeds of Rue and Hemp, of each half a dram,\r\nof Endive, Lettice, Purslain, Gourds, Melons, of each two drams, of\r\nFleawort half an ounce, of Agnus Castus four ounces, the flowers of\r\nWater Lilies, the leaves of Mints, of each half a handful, decoction\r\nof seeds of Lentils, and Coriander seeds, of each half an ounce, three\r\npounds of the decoction, boil them all over a gentle fire till two\r\npounds be consumed, add to the residue, being strained, two ounces of\r\njuice of Lemons, a pound and a half of white sugar, make it into a\r\nSyrup according to art.\r\n\r\n_Culpeper._] A pretty Syrup, and good for little.\r\n\r\n    _Syrupus de Althæa._\r\n    Or Syrup of Marsh-mallows.\r\n\r\n_College._] Take of roots of Marsh-mallows, two ounces, the roots of\r\nGrass Asparagus, Liquorice, Raisins of the Sun stoned, of each half\r\nan ounce, the tops of Mallows, Marsh-mallows, Pellitory of the Wall,\r\nBurnet, Plantain, Maiden-hair white and black, of each a handful, red\r\nCicers an ounce, of the four greater and four lesser cold seeds, of\r\neach three drams, boil them in six pounds of clear Water till four\r\nremain, which being strained, boil into a syrup with four pounds of\r\nwhite sugar.\r\n\r\n_Culpeper._] It is a fine cooling, opening, slipery Syrup, and chiefly\r\ncommendable for the cholic, stone, or gravel, in the kidneys or bladder.\r\n\r\n    _Syrupus de Ammoniaca._\r\n    Or Syrup of Ammoniacum.\r\n\r\n_College._] Take of Maudlin and Cetrach, of each four handfuls, common\r\nWormwood an ounce, the roots of Succory, Sparagus, bark of Caper roots,\r\nof each two ounces, after due preparation steep them twenty-four hours\r\nin three ounces of white Wine, Radish and Fumitory water, of each two\r\npounds, then boil it away to one pound eight ounces, let it settle,\r\nin four ounces of which, whilst it is warm, dissolve by itself Gum\r\nAmmoniacum, first dissolved in white Wine Vinegar, two ounces, boil the\r\nrest with a pound and an half of white sugar into a Syrup, adding the\r\nmixtures of the Gum at the end.\r\n\r\n_Culpeper._] It cools the liver, and opens obstructions both of it and\r\nthe spleen, helps old surfeits, and such like diseases, as scabs, itch,\r\nleprosy, and what else proceed from the liver over heated.

Such as are\r\nobvious to the senses, especially to the taste and smell: for it hath\r\nbeen the practice of most Physicians, in these latter ages as well as\r\nours, to say, when they cannot give, nor are minded to study a reason,\r\nwhy an herb, plant, &c. hath such an operation, or produces such an\r\neffect in the body of man: It doth it by an hidden quality, for they\r\nnot minding the whole creation, as one united body, not knowing what\r\nbelongs to _astral influence_, not regarding that excellent harmony\r\nthe only wise God hath made in a composition of contraries (in the\r\nknowledge of which consists the whole ground and foundation of physic)\r\nare totally led astray by _Tradition_.\r\n\r\nIt is the manifest qualities of medicines that here I am to speak to,\r\nand you may be pleased to behold it in this order.\r\n\r\n    SECTION. 1. _Of the Temperature of Medicines._\r\n    SECTION. 2. _Of the appropriation of Medicines._\r\n    SECTION. 3. _Of the Properties of Medicines._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    SECTION I.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Of the Temperature of Medicines._\r\n\r\nHerbs, plants, and other medicines manifestly operate, either by heat,\r\ncoldness, dryness, or moisture, for the world being composed of so\r\nmany qualities, they and only they can be found in the world, and the\r\nmixtures of them one with another.\r\n\r\nBut that they may appear as clear as the sun when he is upon the\r\nmeridian, I shall treat of them severally, and in this order\r\n\r\n    1. _Of Medicines temperate._\r\n    2. _Of Medicines hot._\r\n    3. _Of Medicines cold._\r\n    4. _Of Medicines moist._\r\n    5. _Of Medicines dry._\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Of Medicines Temperate._\r\n\r\nIf the world be composed of extremes, then it acts by extremes, for\r\nas the man is, so is his work: therefore it is impossible that any\r\nmedicine can be temperate, but may be reduced to heat, cold, dryness,\r\nor moisture, and must operate, (I mean such as operate by manifest\r\nquality) by one of these, because there is no other to operate by, and\r\nthat there should be such a temperate mixture, so exquisitely of these\r\nqualities in any medicine, that one of them should not manifestly excel\r\nthe other, I doubt it is a system too rare to find.\r\n\r\nThus then I conclude the matter to be, those Medicines are called\r\ntemperate (not because they have no excess of temperature at all in\r\nthem) which can neither be said, to heat nor cool so much as will\r\namount to the first degree of excess, for daily experience witnesses\r\nthat they being added to medicines, change not their qualities, they\r\nmake them neither hotter nor colder.\r\n\r\n_Their use._ They are used in such diseases where there is no manifest\r\ndistemper of the first qualities, viz. heat and cold, for example;\r\nIn obstruction of the bowels, where cold medicines might make the\r\nobstruction greater, and hot medicines cause a fever.\r\n\r\nIn fevers of flegm, where the cause is cold and moist, and the effect\r\nhot and dry; in such, use temperate medicines which may neither\r\nencrease the fever by their heat, nor condensate the flegm by their\r\ncoldness.\r\n\r\nBesides, because contraries are taken away by their contraries,\r\nand every like maintained by its like, they are of great use, to\r\npreserve the constitution of the body temperate, and the body itself\r\nin strength and vigour, and may be used without danger, or fear of\r\ndanger, by considering which part of the body is weak, and using such\r\ntemperate medicines as are appropriated to that part.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Of Medicines hot._\r\n\r\nThe care of the ancient Physicians was such that they did not labour\r\nto hide from, but impart to posterity, not only the temperature of\r\nmedicines in general, but also their degrees in temperature, that so\r\nthe distempered part may be brought to its temperature, and no further;\r\nfor all things which are of a contrary temperature, conduce not to\r\ncure, but the strength of the contrariety must be observed, that so the\r\nmedicine may be neither weaker nor stronger, than just to take away\r\nthe distemper; for if the distemper be but meanly hot, and you apply\r\na medicine cold in the fourth degree, it is true, you may soon remove\r\nthat distemper of heat, and bring another of cold twice as bad. _Galen,\r\nde simp. med. facul. lib. 3. cap. 12._\r\n\r\nThen, secondly, Not only the distemper itself, but also the part of\r\nthe body distempered must be heeded; for if the head be distempered by\r\nheat, and you give such medicines as cool the heart or liver, you will\r\nbring another disease, and not cure the former.\r\n\r\nThe degrees then of temperature are to be diligently heeded, which\r\nantient physicians have concluded to be four in the qualities, viz.\r\nheat and cold, of each we shall speak a word or two severally.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Of Medicines hot in the first degree._\r\n\r\nThose are said to be hot in the first degree, which induce a moderate\r\nand natural heat to the body, and to the parts thereof; either cold by\r\nnature, or cooled by accident, by which natural heat is cherished when\r\nweak, or restored when wanting.\r\n\r\n_Effect 1._ The first effect then of medicines hot in the first degree,\r\nis, by their sweet and temperate heat to reduce the body to its\r\nnatural heat, as the fire doth the external parts in cold weather,\r\nunless the affliction of cold be so great that such mild medicines will\r\nnot serve the turn.\r\n\r\n_Effect 2._ The second effect is, the mitigation of pain arising from\r\nsuch a distemper, and indeed this effect hath other medicines, some\r\nthat are cold, and some that are hotter than the first degree, they\r\nbeing rationally applied to the distemper. These medicines the Greeks\r\ncall _Anodyna_, and shall be spoken of in their proper places. In this\r\nplace let it suffice that medicines hot in the first degree, make\r\nthe offending humours thin, and expel them by sweat, or insensible\r\ntranspiration, and these of all others are most congruous or agreeable\r\nto the body of man, for there is no such equal temperature of heat\r\nand cold in a sound man, but heat exceeds, for we live by heat and\r\nmoisture, and not by cold.\r\n\r\nMedicines then which are hot in the first degree, are such as just\r\ncorrespond to the natural heat of our bodies; such as are hotter or\r\ncolder, are more subject to do mischief, being administered by an\r\nunskilful hand, than these are, because of their contrariety to nature;\r\nwhereas these are grateful to the body by their moderate heat.\r\n\r\n_Effect 3._ Thirdly, These take away weariness, and help fevers, being\r\noutwardly applied, because they open the pores of the skin, and by\r\ntheir gentle heat prepare the humours, and take away those fuliginous\r\nvapours that are caused by fevers.\r\n\r\n_Discommodities._] Yet may discommodities arise by heedless giving\r\neven of these, which I would have young students in physic to be very\r\ncareful in, lest they do more mischief than they are aware of, viz.\r\nIt is possible by too much use of them, to consume not only what is\r\ninimical in the body, but also the substance itself, and the strength\r\nof the spirits, whence comes faintings, and sometimes death: besides,\r\nby applying them to the parts of the body they are not appropriated\r\nto, or by not heeding well the complexion of the patient, or the\r\nnatural temper of the part of the body afflicted, for the heart is hot,\r\nbut the brain temperate.\r\n\r\n_Effect 4._ Lastly, Medicines hot in the first degree, cherish heat in\r\nthe internal parts, help concoction, breed good blood, and keep it good\r\nin temper, being bred.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Of Medicines hot in the second degree._\r\n\r\nThese are something hotter than the natural temper of a man.\r\n\r\n_Use._ Their use for such whose stomachs are filled with moisture,\r\nbecause their faculty is too hot and dry; they take away obstructions\r\nor stoppings, open the pores of the skin, but not in the same manner\r\nthat such do as are hot in the first degree, for they do it without\r\nforce, by a gentle heat, concocting, and expelling the humours, by\r\nstrengthening and helping nature in the work; but these cut tough\r\nhumours, and scatter them by their own force and power when nature\r\ncannot.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Of Medicines hot in the third degree._\r\n\r\nThose which attain the third degree of heat, have the same faculties\r\nwith those before mentioned; but as they are hotter, so are they more\r\npowerful in their operations, for they are so powerful in heating and\r\ncutting, that if unadvisedly given they cause fevers. _Use._ Their use\r\nis to cut tough and compacted humours, to provoke sweat abundantly;\r\nhence it comes to pass they all of them resist poison.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Of Medicines hot in the fourth degree._\r\n\r\nThose medicines obtain the highest degree of heat, which are so hot\r\nthat they burn the body of a man, being outwardly applied to it, and\r\ncause inflammations, or raise blisters, as Crowfoot, Mustard-seed,\r\nOnions, &c. Of these more hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Of cooling Medicines._\r\n\r\nPhysicians have also observed four degrees of coldness in medicines,\r\nwhich I shall briefly treat of in order.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Of Medicines cold in the first degree._\r\n\r\nThose medicines which are least cold of all, obtain the first degree of\r\ncoldness; and I beseech you take notice of this, that seeing our bodies\r\nare nourished by heat, and we live by heat, therefore no cold medicines\r\nare friendly to the body, but what good they do our bodies, they do it\r\nby removing an unnatural heat, or the body heated above its natural\r\ntemper.\r\n\r\nThe giving then of cold medicines to a man in his natural temper, the\r\nseason of the year also being but moderately hot, extinguishes natural\r\nheat in the body of man.\r\n\r\nYet have these a necessary use in them too, though not so frequent as\r\nhot medicines have; and that may be the reason why an all wise God hath\r\nfurnished us with far more hot herbs and plants, &c. than cold.\r\n\r\n_Use 1._ Their use is first, in nourishment, that so the heat of food\r\nmay be qualified, and made for a weak stomach to digest.\r\n\r\n_Use 2._ Secondly, To restrain and assuage the heat of the bowels, and\r\nto cool the blood in fevers.\r\n\r\nTherefore if the distemper of heat be but gentle, medicines cold in\r\nthe first degree will suffice; also children, and such people whose\r\nstomachs are weak, are easily hurt by cold medicines.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Of Medicines cold in the second and third degree._\r\n\r\n_Use 1._ Such whose stomachs are strong, and livers hot, may easily\r\nbear such medicines as are cold in the second degree, and in cases of\r\nextremity find much help by them: as also by such as are cold in the\r\nthird degree, the extremity of the disease considered, for by both\r\nthese the unbridled heat of choler is assuaged.\r\n\r\n_Use 2._ Also they are outwardly applied to hot swellings, due\r\nconsideration being had, that if the inflammation be not great, use\r\nthose that are less; if the inflammation be vehement, make use of\r\nmedicines cold in the second or third degree, always let the remedy\r\ncorrespond to the just proportion of the affliction.\r\n\r\n_Use 3._ Thirdly, Sometimes the spirits are moved inordinately through\r\nheat, thence follows immoderate watchings, if not deprivation of the\r\nsenses, this also must be remedied with cold medicines, for cold stops\r\nthe pores of the skin, makes the humours thick, represses sweat, and\r\nkeeps up the spirits from fainting.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Of Medicines cold in the fourth degree._\r\n\r\nLastly, The use of medicines cold in the fourth degree, is, To mitigate\r\ndesperate and vehement pains, stupifying the senses, when no other\r\ncourse can be taken to save life: of the use of which more hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Of moistening Medicines._\r\n\r\nThere can be no such difference found amongst moistening medicines,\r\nthat they should surpass the second degree. For seeing all medicines\r\nare either hot or cold, neither heat nor cold, seeing they are\r\nextremes, can consist with moisture, for the one dries it up, the other\r\ncondensates it.\r\n\r\n_Use._ Phylosophers therefore call moisture and dryness, _passive\r\nqualities_, yet have they their operation likewise; for moist medicines\r\nlenify and make slippery, ease the cough, and help the roughness of the\r\nthroat. These operations are proper to medicines moist in the first\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nThose which are moister, take away naturally strength, help the\r\nsharpness of humours, make both blood and spirits thicker, looses the\r\nbelly, and fits it for purgation.\r\n\r\nThe immoderate or indiscreet use of them dulls the body, and makes it\r\nunfit for action.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Of drying Medicines._\r\n\r\nDrying medicines have contrary faculties to these, viz. To consume\r\nmoisture, stop fluxes, and make such parts dry as are slippery, they\r\nmake the body and members firm, when they are weakened by too much\r\nmoisture, that so they may perform their proper functions.\r\n\r\nYet although the members be strengthened by drying medicines, they have\r\nnotwithstanding their own proper moisture in them, which ought to be\r\nconserved, and not destroyed, for without it they cannot consist: If\r\nthen this moisture be consumed by using, or rather over use of drying\r\nmedicines, the members can neither be nourished, nor yet perform their\r\nproper actions.\r\n\r\nSuch medicines as are dry in the third degree, being unadvisedly\r\ngiven, hinder the parts of the body they are appropriated to, of their\r\nnourishment, and by that means brings them into consumption.\r\n\r\nBesides, There is a certain moisture in the body of man, which is\r\ncalled _radical moisture_, which being taken away, the parts must needs\r\ndie, seeing natural heat and life also consists in it, and this may be\r\ndone by too frequent use of medicines dry in the fourth degree: And it\r\nmay be this was the reason of _Galen’s_ writing, that things dry in the\r\nfourth degree, must of necessity burn; which is an effect of heat, and\r\nnot of dryness, unless by burning, _Galen_ means consuming the radical\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\nThe use then of drying medicines, is only to such bodies, and parts of\r\nthe body, as abound with moisture, in which observe these rules.\r\n\r\n1. If the moisture be not extreme, let not the medicine be extremely\r\ndrying.\r\n\r\n2. Let it be proper to the part of the body afflicted, for if the liver\r\nbe afflicted by moisture, and you go about to dry the brain or heart,\r\nyou may sooner kill than cure.\r\n\r\nThus have we briefly spoken of the first qualities of medicines, and in\r\nthe general only, and but briefly, because we shall always touch upon\r\nthem in the exposition of the other qualities, in which you must always\r\nhave an eye to these.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    SECTION II.\r\n\r\n    _Of the appropriation of Medicines to the\r\n    several parts of the body._\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the qualities and use of these medicines may be found out, and\r\nunderstood by every one, and so my country reap the benefit of my\r\nlabour, they shall find them presented to their view in this order.\r\n\r\nMedicines appropriated.\r\n\r\n    1. _To the head._\r\n    2. _To the breast and lungs._\r\n    3. _To the heart._\r\n    4. _To the stomach._\r\n    5. _To the liver._\r\n    6. _To the spleen._\r\n    7. _To the reins and bladder._\r\n    8. _To the womb._\r\n    9. _To the joints._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n_Of Medicines appropriated to the head._\r\n\r\n\r\nBy [_head_] is usually understood all that part of the body which is\r\nbetween the top of the crown, and the uppermost joint of the neck,\r\nyet are those medicines properly called _Cephalical_, which are\r\nappropriated to the brain, not to the eyes, ears, nor teeth; neither\r\nare those medicines which are proper to the ears, proper also to the\r\neyes, therefore (my intent being to write as plain as I can) I shall\r\nsubdivide this chapter into these parts.\r\n\r\nMedicines appropriated\r\n\r\n    1. _To the brain._\r\n    2. _To the eyes._\r\n    3. _To the mouth, and nostrils._\r\n    4. _To the ears._\r\n    5. _To the teeth._\r\n\r\nFor what medicines are appropriated to an unruly tongue, is not in my\r\npower at present to determine.\r\n\r\n    _Of Medicines appropriated to the brain._\r\n\r\nBefore we treat of medicines appropriated to the brain, it is requisite\r\nthat we describe what the nature and affection of the brain is.\r\n\r\nThe brain which is the seat of apprehension, judgment, and memory, the\r\noriginal of sense and motion, is by nature temperate, and if so, then\r\nyou will grant me that it may easily be afflicted both by heat and\r\ncold, and it is indeed more subject to affliction by either of them,\r\nthan any other part of the body, for if it be afflicted by heat, sense\r\nand reason, it is immoderately moved, if by cold, they languish, and\r\nare dulled, to pass by other symptoms which invade the head, if the\r\nbrain be altered from its proper temper.\r\n\r\nAlso this is peculiar to the brain, that it is delighted or offended by\r\nsmells, sights, and sounds, but I shall meddle no further with these\r\nhere, because they are not medicines.\r\n\r\n_Cephalical_ Medicines may be found out from the affections of the\r\nbrain itself. The brain is usually oppressed with moisture in such\r\nafflictions; therefore give such medicines as very gently warm,\r\ncleanse, cut, and dry: but withal, let them be such as are appropriated\r\nto the head, such as physicians say (by an hidden quality) strengthen\r\nthe brain.\r\n\r\nAgain, if you consider the situation of the brain, you shall find\r\nit placed in the highest part of the body, therefore it is easily\r\nafflicted with hot vapours: this punishes a man with watching and\r\nhead-ache, as the former did with sottishness and sleepiness, in such\r\ncases use such _Cephalecs_ as gently cool the brain.\r\n\r\nTo make _Cephalecs_ of _Narcoticks_, or stupifying medicines, is not my\r\nintent, for I am confident they are inimical both to brain and senses.\r\nOf these, and such medicines as also purge the brain, I shall speak by\r\nand by. To return to my purpose.\r\n\r\nSome Cephalics purge the brain, some heat it, some cool it, some\r\nstrengthen it; but how they perform this office peculiarly to the\r\nbrain, most physicians confess they could neither comprehend by reason,\r\nnor describe by precepts, only thus, they do it by an hidden quality,\r\neither by strengthening the brain, thereby descending it from diseases,\r\nor by a certain antipathy between them and the diseases incident to the\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\nLastly, For the use of Cephalics, observe, if the brain be much\r\nafflicted, you cannot well strengthen it before you have purged it,\r\nneither can you well purge the brain before you have cleansed the rest\r\nof the body, it is so subject to receive the vapours up to it; give\r\ncooling Cephalics when the brain is too hot, and hot Cephalics when it\r\nis too cold.\r\n\r\nBeware of using cooling medicines to the brain when the crisis of a\r\ndisease is near: how that time may be known, I shall (God assisting\r\nme) instruct you hereafter, let it suffice now, that according as the\r\ndisease afflicting your head is, so let your remedy be.\r\n\r\n    _Of Medicines appropriated to the eyes._\r\n\r\nTake such medicines as are appropriated to the eyes under the name of\r\n(_Ocular Medicines_) I do it partly to avoid multiplicity of words,\r\nand partly to instruct my countrymen in the terms of art belonging to\r\nphysic, (I would have called them [_Ophthalmics_] had not the word\r\nbeen troublesome to the reading, much more to the understanding of a\r\ncountryman) as I even now called such medicines [_Cephalics_] as were\r\nappropriated to the brain.\r\n\r\nOcular medicines are two-fold, viz. such as are referred to the visive\r\nvirtues, and such as are referred to the eyes themselves.\r\n\r\nSuch as strengthen the visive virtue or the optick nerves which convey\r\nit to the eyes (say Doctors) do it by an hidden virtue, into the\r\nreason which no man can dive, unless they should fetch it from the\r\nsimilitude of the substance: And yet they say a Goat’s liver conduces\r\nmuch to make one see in the night, and they give this reason, because\r\nGoats see as well in the night as in the day. Yet is there no affinity\r\nin temperature nor substance between the liver and the eyes: However\r\nAstrologers know well enough that all herbs, plants, &c. that are under\r\nthe dominion of either sun or moon, and appropriated to the head, be\r\nthey hot or cold they strengthen the visive virtue, as Eyebright, which\r\nis hot, _Lunaria_, or Moonwort which is cold.\r\n\r\nAs for what appertains to the constitution of the eyes themselves,\r\nseeing they are exact in sense, they will not endure the least\r\ninconvenience, therefore such medicines as are outwardly applied to\r\nthem (for such medicines as strengthen the visive virtues are always\r\ngiven inwardly) let them neither hurt by their hardness nor gnawing\r\nquality, nor be so tough that they should stick to them. Therefore\r\nlet ocular medicines be neither in powders nor ointments, because oil\r\nitself is offensive to the eyes, and how pleasing powders are to them,\r\nyou may perceive yourself by just going into the dust.\r\n\r\n    _Medicines appropriated to the mouth and nose._\r\n\r\nApply no stinking medicine to a disease in the nose, for such offend\r\nnot only the nose, but also the brain; neither administer medicines\r\nof any ill taste to a disease in the mouth, for that subverts the\r\nstomach, because the tunicle of the mouth and of the stomach is the\r\nsame: and because both mouth and nostrils are ways by which the brain\r\nis cleansed, therefore are they infected with such vices as need almost\r\ncontinual cleansing, and let the medicines you apply to them be either\r\npleasant, or at least, not ingrateful.\r\n\r\n    _Medicines appropriated to the ears._\r\n\r\nThe ears are easily afflicted by cold, because they are always open,\r\ntherefore they require hot medicines. And because they are of\r\nthemselves very dry, therefore they require medicines which dry much.\r\n\r\n    _Medicines appropriated to the teeth._\r\n\r\nVehement heat, and vehement cold, are inimical to the teeth, but they\r\nare most of all offended by sharp and sour things, and the reason is,\r\nbecause they have neither skin nor flesh to cover them, they delight in\r\nsuch medicines as are cleansing and binding, because they are troubled\r\nwith defluxions and rheums upon every light occasion; and that’s the\r\nreason the common use of fat and sweet things, soon rots the teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n_Of Medicines appropriated to the breast and lungs._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe medicines appropriated to the breast and lungs, you shall find\r\ncalled all along by the name of [_pectorals_] that’s the term\r\nPhysicians give them, when you heat them talk of pectoral Syrups,\r\npectoral rows, or pectoral Ointments.\r\n\r\nThey are divers, some of which regard the part afflicted, others the\r\nmatter afflicting.\r\n\r\nBut although sometimes in ulcers of the lungs, we are forced to\r\nuse binding medicines, to join the ulcer, yet are not these called\r\npectorals, because binding medicines are extreme hurtful to the breast\r\nand lungs, both because they hinder one’s fetching his breath, and also\r\nbecause they hinder the avoiding that flegm by which the breast is\r\noppressed.\r\n\r\nSuch medicines are called pectorals, which are of a lenifying nature.\r\n\r\nBesides, Those which make thin matter thicker are of two sorts, _viz._\r\nSome are mild and gentle, which may safely be administered, be the\r\nmatter hot or cold which offendeth; others are very cold, which are\r\nused only when the matter offending is sharp.\r\n\r\nBut because such medicines as conduce to the cure of the phthisics\r\n(which is an ulceration of the lungs, and the disease usually called,\r\nthe consumption of the lungs,) are also reckoned in amongst pectorals,\r\nit is not amiss to speak a word or two of them.\r\n\r\nIn the cure of this disease are three things to be regarded.\r\n\r\n    1. _To cut and bring away the concreted blood._\r\n    2. _To cherish and strengthen the lungs._\r\n    3. _To conglutinate the ulcer._\r\n\r\nAnd indeed some particular simples will perform all these, and\r\nphysicians confess it; which shews the wonderful mystery the all-wise\r\nGod hath made in the creation, that one and the same simple should\r\nperform two contrary operations on the same part of the body; for the\r\nmore a medicine cleanses, the more it conglutinates.\r\n\r\nTo conclude then, Pectoral Medicines are such as either cut and cleanse\r\nout the compacted humours from the arteries of the lungs, or make thin\r\ndefluxions thick, or temper those that are sharp, help the roughness of\r\nthe wind-pipe, or are generally lenitive and softening, being outwardly\r\napplied to the breast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n_Of Medicines appropriated to the heart._\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are they which are generally given under the notion of Cordials;\r\ntake them under that name here.\r\n\r\nThe heart is the seat of the vital spirit, the fountain of life, the\r\noriginal of infused heat, and of the natural affections of man.\r\n\r\nSo then these two things are proper to the heart.\r\n\r\n    1. By its heat to cherish life throughout the body.\r\n    2. To add vigour to the affections.\r\n\r\nAnd if these be proper to the heart, you will easily grant me, that\r\nit is the property of cordials to administer to the heart in these\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\nOf Cordials, some cheer the mind, some strengthen the heart, and\r\nrefresh the spirits thereof, being decayed.\r\n\r\nThose which cheer the mind, are not one and the same; for as the heart\r\nis variously disturbed, either by anger, love, fear, hatred, sadness,\r\n&c. So such things as flatter lovers or appease the angry, or comfort\r\nthe fearful, or please the hateful, may well be called cordials; for\r\nthe heart, seeing it is placed in the middle between the brain and the\r\nliver, is wrought upon by reason, as well as by digestion, yet these,\r\nbecause they are not medicines, are beside my present scope.\r\n\r\nAnd although it is true, that mirth, love, &c. are actions, or motions\r\nof the mind, not of the body; yet many have been induced to think such\r\naffections may be wrought in the body by medicines.\r\n\r\nThe heart is chiefly afflicted by too much heat, by poison, and\r\nby stinking vapours, and these are remedied by the second sort of\r\ncordials, and indeed chiefly belong to our present scope.\r\n\r\nAccording to these three afflictions, _viz._\r\n\r\n    1. _Excessive heat._\r\n    2. _Poison._\r\n    3. _Melancholy vapours._\r\n\r\nAre three kinds of remedies which succour the afflicted heart.\r\n\r\nSuch as\r\n\r\n    1. _By their cooling nature mitigate the heat of fevers._\r\n    2. _Resist poison._\r\n    3. _Cherish the vital spirits when they languish._\r\n\r\nAll these are called Cordials.\r\n\r\n1. Such as cool the heart in fevers, yet is not every thing that\r\ncooleth cordial, for lead is colder than gold, yet is not lead cordial\r\nas gold is, some hold it cordial by a hidden quality, others by reason.\r\n\r\n2. Such as resist poison; there is a two-fold resisting of poison.\r\n\r\n1. _By an antipathy between the medicine and poison._\r\n\r\n2. _By a sympathy between the medicine and the heart._\r\n\r\nOf the first we shall speak anon, in a chapter by itself. The latter\r\nbelongs to this chapter, and they are such medicines, whose nature is\r\nto strengthen the heart, and fortify it against the poison, as Rue,\r\nAngelica, &c. For as the operation of the former is upon the poison,\r\nwhich afflicteth the heart, so the operation of the latter is upon the\r\nheart afflicted by the poison.\r\n\r\nTo this class may be referred all such medicines as strengthen the\r\nheart either by astral influence, or by likeness of substance, if there\r\nbe such a likeness in medicines, for a Bullock’s heart is of like\r\nsubstance to man’s, yet I question whether it be cordial or not.\r\n\r\n3. And lastly, Such as refresh the spirits, and make them lively and\r\nactive, both because they are appropriated to the office, and also\r\nbecause they drive stinking and melancholy vapours from the heart, for\r\nas the animal spirit be refreshed by fragrant smells, and the natural\r\nspirits by spices, so are the vital spirits refreshed by all such\r\nmedicines as keep back melancholy vapours from the heart, as Borrage,\r\nBugloss, Rosemary, Citron Pills, the compositions of them, and many\r\nothers, which this treatise will amply furnish you with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n_Of Medicines appropriated to the stomach._\r\n\r\n\r\nBy stomach, I mean that ventricle which contains the food till it be\r\nconcocted into chyle.\r\n\r\nMedicines appropriated to the stomach are usually called stomachicals.\r\n\r\nThe infirmities usually incident to the stomach are three.\r\n\r\n    1. Appetite lost.\r\n    2. Digestion weakened.\r\n    3. The retentive faculty corrupted.\r\n\r\nWhen the appetite is lost, the man feels no hunger when his body needs\r\nnourishment.\r\n\r\nWhen digestion is weakened it is not able to concoct the meat received\r\ninto the stomach, but it putrifies there.\r\n\r\nWhen the retentive faculty is spoiled the stomach is not able to retain\r\nthe food till it be digested, but either vomits it up again, or causes\r\nfluxes.\r\n\r\nSuch medicines then as remedy all these, are called stomachicals. And\r\nof them in order.\r\n\r\n1. Such as provoke appetite are usually of a sharp or sourish taste,\r\nand yet withal of a grateful taste to the palate, for although loss of\r\nappetite may proceed from divers causes, as from choler in the stomach,\r\nor putrefied humours or the like, yet such things as purge this choler\r\nor humours, are properly called _Orecticks_, not stomachicals; the\r\nformer strengthen appetite after these are expelled.\r\n\r\n2. Such medicines help digestion as strengthen the stomach, either by\r\nconvenient heat, or aromatic (viz. spicy) faculty, by hidden property,\r\nor congruity of nature.\r\n\r\n3. The retentive faculty of the stomach is corrected by binding\r\nmedicines, yet not by all binding medicines neither, for some of them\r\nare adverse to the stomach, but by such binding medicines as are\r\nappropriated to the stomach.\r\n\r\nFor the use of these.\r\n\r\n_Use 1._ Use not such medicines as provoke appetite before you have\r\ncleansed the stomach of what hinders it.\r\n\r\n_Use 2._ Such medicines as help digestion, give them a good time before\r\nmeat that so they may pass to the bottom of the stomach, (for the\r\ndigestive faculty lies there,) before the food come into it.\r\n\r\n_Use 3._ Such as strengthen the retentive faculty, give them a little\r\nbefore meat, if to stay fluxes, a little after meat, if to stay\r\nvomiting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n_Of Medicines appropriated to the liver._\r\n\r\n\r\nBe pleased to take these under the name of _Hepatics_, for that is the\r\nusual name physicians give them, and these also are of three sorts.\r\n\r\n    1. Some the liver is delighted in.\r\n    2. Others strengthen it.\r\n    3. Others help its vices.\r\n\r\nThe palate is the seat of taste, and its office is to judge what food\r\nis agreeable to the stomach, and what not, by that is both the quality\r\nand quantity of food for the stomach discerned: the very same office\r\nthe _meseraik_ veins perform to the liver.\r\n\r\nSometimes such food pleases the palate which the liver likes not (but\r\nnot often) and therefore the _meseraik_ veins refuse it, and that is\r\nthe reason some few men fancy such food as makes them sick after the\r\neating thereof.\r\n\r\n1. The liver is delighted exceedingly with sweet things, draws them\r\ngreedily, and digests them as swiftly, and that is the reason honey is\r\nso soon turned into choler.\r\n\r\n2. Such medicines strengthen the liver, as (being appropriated to it)\r\nvery gently bind, for seeing the office of the liver is to concoct,\r\nit needs some adstriction, that so both the heat and the humour to be\r\nconcocted may be stayed, that so the one slip not away, nor the other\r\nbe scattered.\r\n\r\nYet do not hepatical medicines require so great a binding faculty as\r\nstomachicals do, because the passages of the stomach are more open\r\nthan those of the liver by which it either takes in chyle, or sends\r\nout blood to the rest of the body, therefore medicines that are very\r\nbinding are hurtful to the liver, and either cause obstructions, or\r\nhinder the distribution of the blood, or both.\r\n\r\nAnd thus much for the liver, the office of which is to concoct chyle,\r\n(which is a white substance the stomach digests the food into) into\r\nblood, and distributes it, by the veins, to every part of the body,\r\nwhereby the body is nourished, and decaying flesh restored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n_Of Medicines appropriated to the spleen._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the breeding of blood, are three excrements most conspicuous, viz.\r\n_urine_, _choler_, and _melancholy_.\r\n\r\nThe proper seat of choler is in the gall.\r\n\r\nThe urine passeth down to the reins or kidneys, which is all one.\r\n\r\nThe spleen takes the thickest or melancholy blood to itself.\r\n\r\nThis excrement of blood is twofold: for either by excessive heat, it\r\nis addust, and this is that the Latins call _Atra Bilis_: or else it\r\nis thick and earthly of itself, and this properly is called melancholy\r\nhumour.\r\n\r\nHence then is the nature of splenical medicines to be found out, and\r\nby these two is the spleen usually afflicted for _Atra bilis_, (I know\r\nnot what distinct English name to give it) many times causes madness,\r\nand pure melancholy causeth obstructions of the bowels, and tumours,\r\nwhereby the concoction of the blood is vitiated, and dropsies many\r\ntimes follow.\r\n\r\nMedicines then peculiar to the spleen must needs be twofold also, some\r\nappropriated to _Atra bilis_, others to pure melancholy; but of purging\r\neither of them, I shall omit till I come to treat of purging in a\r\nchapter by itself.\r\n\r\n1. Such medicines are splenical, which by cooling and moistening temper\r\n_Atra bilis_: let not these medicines be too cold neither, for there is\r\nno such heat in _Atra bilis_ as there is in choler, and therefore it\r\nneeds no such excessive cooling: amongst the number of these are such\r\nas we mentioned amongst the cordials to repel melancholy vapours from\r\nthe heart, such temper and assuage the malice of _Atra bilis_.\r\n\r\n2. Those medicines are also splenical, by which melancholy humours are\r\ncorrected and so prepared, that they may the more easily be evacuated:\r\nsuch medicines are cutting and opening, and they differ from hepaticals\r\nin this that they are no ways binding; for the spleen being no ways\r\naddicted to concoction, binding medicines do it harm, and not good.\r\n\r\n3. Sometimes the spleen is not only obstructed, but also hardened by\r\nmelancholy humours, and in such cases emolient medicines may be well\r\ncalled splenicals, not such as are taken inwardly, for they operate\r\nupon the stomach and bowels, but such as are outwardly applied to the\r\nregion of the spleen.\r\n\r\nAnd although sometimes medicines, are outwardly applied to hardness of\r\nthe liver, yet they differ from splenicals, because they are binding,\r\nso are not splenicals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n_Of Medicines appropriated to the reins and bladder._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe office of the reins is, to make a separation between the blood and\r\nthe urine; to receive this urine thus separated from the blood, is the\r\nbladder ordained, which is of a sufficient bigness to contain it.\r\n\r\nBoth these parts of the body officiating about the urine, they are both\r\nusually afflicted by the vices of the urine.\r\n\r\n    1. _By stones._\r\n    2. _By inflammation._\r\n    3. _By thick humours._\r\n\r\nMedicines appropriated to the reins and bladder are usually called\r\n_Nephriticals_, and are threefold; some cool, others cut gross humours,\r\nand a third sort breaks the stone.\r\n\r\nIn the use of all these, take notice, that the constitution of the\r\nreins and bladder is such, that they abhor all binding medicines\r\nbecause they cause stoppage of urine.\r\n\r\nTake notice, that the reins and bladder being subject to inflammations\r\nendure not very hot medicines.\r\n\r\nBecause the bladder is further remote from the centre of the body than\r\nthe kidnies are, therefore it requires stronger medicines than the\r\nkidnies do, lest the strength of the medicine be spent before it be\r\ncome to the part afflicted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n_Of Medicines appropriated to the womb._\r\n\r\n\r\nThese, physicians call _Hystericals_, and to avoid multiplicity of\r\nwords, take them in this discourse under that notion.\r\n\r\nTake notice that such medicines as provoke the menses, or stop them\r\nwhen they flow immoderately, are properly hystericals, but shall be\r\nspoken to by and by in a chapter by themselves.\r\n\r\nAs for the nature of the womb, it seems to be much like the nature of\r\nthe brain and stomach, for experience teacheth that it is delighted\r\nwith sweet and aromatical medicines, and flies from their contraries.\r\n\r\nFor example: a woman being troubled with the fits of the mother, which\r\nis drawing of the womb upward, apply sweet things, as Civet, or the\r\nlike, to the place of conception, it draws it down again; but apply\r\nstinking things to the nose, as Assafœtida, or the like, it expels it\r\nfrom it, and sends it down to its proper place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n_Of Medicines appropriated to the joints._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe joints are usually troubled with cephalic diseases, and then are to\r\nbe cured by cephalic medicines.\r\n\r\nMedicines appropriated to the joints, are called by the name\r\n_Arthritical_ medicines.\r\n\r\nThe joints, seeing they are very nervous, require medicines which are\r\nof a heating and drying nature, with a gentle binding, and withal, such\r\nas by peculiar virtue are appropriated to them, and add strength to\r\nthem. It is true, most cephalics do so, yet because the joints are more\r\nremote from the centre, they require stronger medicines.\r\n\r\nFor removing pains in the joints this is the method of proceeding.\r\n\r\nPain is either taken away or eased, for the true cure is to take away\r\nthe cause of the pain, sometimes the vehemency of the pain is so great\r\nthat you must be forced to use _Anodines_ (for so physicians call such\r\nmedicines as ease pain) before you can meddle with the cause, and\r\nthis is usually when the part pained is inflamed, for those medicines\r\nwhich take away the cause of pain being very hot, if there be any\r\ninflammation in the part pained, you must abstain from them till the\r\ninflammation be taken away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    SECTION III.\r\n\r\n    _Of the propriety or operation of Medicines._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n_Of Emolient Medicines._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe various mixtures of heat, cold, dryness, and moisture in simples,\r\nmust of necessity produce variety of faculties, and operations in them,\r\nwhich now we come to treat of, beginning first at emolients.\r\n\r\nWhat is hard, and what is soft, most men know, but few are able to\r\nexpress. Phylosophers define that to be hard which yields not to\r\ntouching, and soft to be the contrary. An emolient, or softening\r\nmedicine is one which reduceth a hard substance to its proper\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nBut to leave phylosophy, and keep to physic: physicians describe\r\nhardness to be two-fold.\r\n\r\n1. A distention or stretching of a part by too much fulness.\r\n\r\n2. Thick humours which are destitute of heat, growing hard in that part\r\nof the body into which they flow.\r\n\r\nSo many properties then ought emolient medicines to have, viz. To\r\nmoisten what is dry, to discuss what is stretched, to warm what is\r\ncongealed by cold; yet properly, that only is said to mollify which\r\nreduceth a hard substance to its proper temperature.\r\n\r\nDryness and thickness of humours being the cause of hardness, emolient\r\nmedicines must of necessity be hot and moist; and although you may\r\nperadventure find some of them dry in the second or third degrees, yet\r\nmust this dryness be tempered and qualified with heat and moisture, for\r\nreason will tell you that dry medicines make hard parts harder.\r\n\r\nMollifying medicines are known, 1. by their taste, 2. by their feeling.\r\n\r\n1. In taste, they are near unto sweat, but fat and oily; they are\r\nneither sharp, nor austere, nor sour, nor salt, neither do they\r\nmanifest either binding, or vehement heat, or cold to be in them.\r\n\r\n2. In feeling you can perceive no roughness, neither do they stick to\r\nyour fingers like Birdlime, for they ought to penetrate the parts to\r\nbe mollified, and therefore many times if occasion be, are cutting\r\nmedicines mixed with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n_Of hardening Medicines._\r\n\r\n\r\nGalen in _Lib. 5. de Simple, Med. Facult. Cap. 10._ determines\r\nhardening medicines to be cold and moist, and he brings some arguments\r\nto prove it, against which other physicians contest.\r\n\r\nI shall not here stand to quote the dispute, only take notice, that\r\nif softening medicines be hot and moist (as we shewed even now) then\r\nhardening medicines must needs be cold and dry, because they are\r\ncontrary to them.\r\n\r\nThe universal course of nature will prove it, for dryness and moisture\r\nare passive qualities, neither can extremeties consist in moisture as\r\nyou may know, if you do but consider that dryness is not attributed to\r\nthe air, nor water, but to the fire, and earth.\r\n\r\n2. The thing to be _congealed_ must needs be moist, therefore the\r\nmedicine _congealing_ must of necessity be dry, for if cold be joined\r\nwith dryness, it contracts the pores, that so the humours cannot be\r\nscattered.\r\n\r\nYet you must observe a difference between medicines drying, making\r\nthick, hardening, and congealing, of which differences, a few words\r\nwill not do amiss.\r\n\r\n1. Such medicines are said to dry, which draw out, or drink up the\r\nmoisture, as a spunge drinks up water.\r\n\r\n2. Such medicines are said to make thick, as do not consume the\r\nmoisture, but add dryness to it, as you make syrups into a thick\r\nelectuary by adding powders to them.\r\n\r\n3. Such as congeal, neither draw out the moisture, nor make it thick\r\nby adding dryness to it, but contract it by vehement cold, as water is\r\nfrozen into ice.\r\n\r\n4. Hardness differs from all these, for the parts of the body swell,\r\nand are filled with flegmatic humours, or melancholy blood, which at\r\nlast grows hard.\r\n\r\nThat you may clearly understand this, observe but these two things.\r\n\r\n    1. What it is which worketh.\r\n    2. What it worketh upon.\r\n\r\nThat which worketh is outwardly cold. That which is wrought upon, is a\r\ncertain thickness and dryness, of humours, for if the humour were fluid\r\nas water is, it might properly be said to be congealed by cold, but not\r\nso properly hardened. Thus you see cold and dryness to be the cause of\r\nhardening. This hardening being so far from being useful, that it is\r\nobnoxious to the body of man. I pass it without more words. I suppose\r\nwhen _Galen_ wrote of hardening medicines, he intended such as make\r\nthick, and therefore amongst them he reckons up Fleawort, Purslain,\r\nHouseleek, and the like, which assuage the heat of the humours in\r\nswellings, and stops subtil and sharp defluxions upon the lungs; but of\r\nthese more anon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n_Of Loosening Medicines._\r\n\r\n\r\nBy loosening here, I do not mean purging, nor that which is opposite\r\nto astringency; but that which is opposite to stretching: I knew\r\nnot suddenly what fitter English name to give it, than loosening or\r\nlaxation, which latter is scarce English.\r\n\r\nThe members are distended or stretched divers ways, and ought to be\r\nloosened by as many, for they are stretched sometimes by dryness,\r\nsometimes by cold, sometimes by repletion or fullness, sometimes by\r\nswellings, and sometimes by some of these joined together. I avoid\r\nterms of art as much as I can, because it would profit my country\r\nbut little, to give them the rules of physic in such English as they\r\nunderstand not.\r\n\r\nI confess the opinion of ancient physicians hath been various about\r\nthese loosening medicines. _Galen’s_ opinion was, that they might be\r\nreferred either to moistening, or heating, or mollifying, or evacuating\r\nmedicines, and therefore ought not to be referred to a chapter by\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIt is likely they may, and so may all other medicines be referred to\r\nheat, or coldness, or dryness, or moisture: but we speak not here of\r\nthe particular properties of medicines, but of their joined properties,\r\nas they heat and moisten.\r\n\r\nOthers, they question how they can be distinguished from such as\r\nmollify, seeing such as are loosening, and such as are emolient, are\r\nboth of them hot and moist.\r\n\r\nTo that, thus: stretching and loosening are ascribed to the moveable\r\nparts of the body, as to the muscles and their tendons, to the\r\nligaments and _Membranæ_; but softness and hardness to such parts\r\nof the body as may be felt with the hand: I shall make clear by a\r\nsimilitude, Wax is softened, being hard, but Fiddle-strings are\r\nloosened being stretched. And if you say that the difference lying only\r\nin the parts of the body is no true difference, then take notice, that\r\nsuch medicines which loosen, are less hot, and more moistening, than\r\nsuch as soften, for they operate most by heat, these by moisture.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, I am of opinion the difference is not much, nay, scarce\r\nsensible, between emolient and loosening medicines; only I quoted this\r\nin a chapter by itself, not so much because some authors do, as because\r\nit conduceth to the increase of knowledge in physic, for want of which,\r\nthis poor nation is almost spoiled.\r\n\r\nThe chief use of loosening medicines is in convulsions and cramps, and\r\nsuch like infirmities which cause distention or stretching.\r\n\r\nThey are known by the very same marks and tokens that emolient\r\nmedicines are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n_Of drawing Medicines._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opinion of physicians is, concerning these, as it is concerning\r\nother medicines, viz. Some draw by a manifest quality, some by a\r\nhidden, and so (quoth they) they draw to themselves both humours and\r\nthorns, or splinters that are gotten into the flesh; however this is\r\ncertain, they are all of them hot, and of thin parts; hot because the\r\nnature of heat is to draw off thin parts that so they may penetrate to\r\nthe humours that are to to be drawn out.\r\n\r\n    Their use is various, _viz._\r\n\r\n_Use 1._ That the bowels may be disburdened of corrupt humours.\r\n\r\n2. Outwardly used, by them the offending humour (I should have said the\r\npeccant humour, had I written only to scholars,) is called from the\r\ninternal parts of the body to the superfices.\r\n\r\n3. By them the crisis of a disease is much helped forward.\r\n\r\n4. They are exceedingly profitable to draw forth poison out of the body.\r\n\r\n5. Parts of the body over cooled are cured by these medicines, viz.\r\nby applying them outwardly to the place, not only because they heat,\r\nbut also because they draw the spirits by which life and heat are\r\ncherished, to the part of the body which is destitute of them: you\r\ncannot but know that many times parts of the body fall away in flesh,\r\nand their strength decays, as in some persons arms or legs, or the\r\nlike, the usual reason is, because the vital spirit decays in those\r\nparts, to which use such plaisters or ointments as are attractive\r\n(which is the physical term for drawing medicines) for they do not only\r\ncherish the parts by their own proper heat, but draw the vital and\r\nnatural spirits thither, whereby they are both quickened and nourished.\r\n\r\nThey are known almost by the same tokens that attenuating medicines\r\nare, seeing heat; and thinness of parts is in them both, they differ\r\nonly in respect of quantity, thinness of parts being most proper to\r\nattenuating medicines, but attractive medicines are hotter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n_Of discussive Medicines._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nature of discussing (or sweating) medicines is almost the same\r\nwith attractive, for there are no discussive medicines but are\r\nattractive, nor scarce any attractive medicine but is in some measure\r\nor other discussing. The difference then is only this; that discussive\r\nmedicines are hotter than attractive, and therefore nothing else need\r\nbe written of their nature.\r\n\r\n_Use._ Their use may be known even from their very name; for diseases\r\nthat come by repletion or fulness, are cured by evacuation or emptying;\r\nyet neither blood nor gross humours are to be expelled by sweating,\r\nor insensible transpiration (as they call it) but the one requires\r\nblood-letting, the other purgation, but _scrosus_ or thin humours and\r\nfilthy vapours, and such like superfluities, are to be expelled by\r\nsweat, and be wary in this too, for many of them work violently, and\r\nviolent medicines are not rashly to be given.\r\n\r\n_Caution 2._ Besides, swellings are sometimes made so hard by sweating\r\nmedicines, that afterwards they can never be cured; for what is thin\r\nbeing by such medicines taken away, nothing but what is perfectly hard\r\nremains: If you fear such a thing, mix emolients with them.\r\n\r\n_Caut. 3._ Again, sometimes by using discussives, the humours offending\r\n(which physicians usually call the _peccant humours_) is driven to some\r\nmore noble part of the body, or else it draws more than it discusseth;\r\nin such cases, concoct and attenuate the matter offending before you go\r\nabout to discuss it.\r\n\r\nFrom hence may easily be gathered at what time of the disease\r\ndiscussive medicines are to be used, viz. about the declining of the\r\ndisease, although in diseases arising from heat of blood, we sometimes\r\nuse them in the encrease and state of them.\r\n\r\nThey are known by the same marks and tokens attenuating medicines are,\r\nviz. by their burning and biting quality, they being very hot, and of\r\nthin parts, void of any biting quality, therefore they contract not the\r\ntongue in tasting of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n_Of repelling Medicines._\r\n\r\n\r\nRepelling medicines are of contrary operation to these three last\r\nmentioned, viz. attenuating, drawing, and discussive medicines: It is\r\ntrue, there is but little difference between these three, some hold\r\nnone at all; and if you will be so nice, you may oppose them thus. And\r\nso medicines making thick, correspond to attenuating medicines, or such\r\nas make thin, repelling medicines are opposed to such as draw, and such\r\nas retain the humours and make them tough, are opposite to such as\r\ndiscuss, some hold this niceness needless.\r\n\r\n2. The sentence of authors about repulsive medicines is various.\r\n\r\nFor seeing an influxion may be caused many ways, a repulsive hath got\r\nas many definitions.\r\n\r\nFor such things as cool, bind, stop, and make thick, stay influxions,\r\nand therefore repulsives are by authors opposed, not only to\r\nattractives, but also to attenuating, and discussing medicines.\r\n\r\nBut properly such things are called repulsives, which do not only stay\r\ninfluxions, (for so do such medicines which stop and make thick) but\r\nsuch as drive the humours flowing to, or inherit in the place, to some\r\nother place.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, binding is inherent to repulsives, so is not coldness nor\r\nmaking thick: Yet such as are binding, cold and thin in operation, are\r\nmost effectual.\r\n\r\nYour taste will find repulsives to be, tart, or sharp, or austere, with\r\na certain binding which contracts the tongue.\r\n\r\n_Use 1._ Their use is manifold, as in hot tumours, head-aches, or the\r\nlike.\r\n\r\n_Use 2._ By these in fevers are the vapours driven from the head,\r\nVinegar of Roses is notable.\r\n\r\n_Time of giving._ They are most commodious in the beginning and\r\nencrease of a disease, for then influxions most prevail.\r\n\r\nBut seeing that in the cure of tumours there are two scopes, 1. That\r\nthat which flows to it may be repelled. 2. That that which is already\r\nin it may be discussed; repulsives are most commodiously used in the\r\nbeginning, discussives in the latter end.\r\n\r\nIn the middle you may mix them, with this proviso, that repulsives\r\nexceed in the beginning, discussives in the latter end.\r\n\r\n_Caution 1._ If the matter offending be of a venomous quality, either\r\nabstain from repulsives altogether, or use purging first, lest the\r\nmatter fly to the bowels and prove dangerous, especially if the bowels\r\nbe weak.\r\n\r\n2. Also forbear repulsives, if the pain be great.\r\n\r\n3. Lastly, Have a care lest by repulsives you contract the pores so\r\nmuch, that the matter cannot be removed by discussives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n_Of cleansing Medicines._\r\n\r\n\r\nCleansing medicines can neither be defined by heat, nor coldness,\r\nbecause some of both sorts cleanse.\r\n\r\nA cleansing medicine, then, is of a terrene quality, which takes away\r\nthe filth with it, and carries it out.\r\n\r\n_Definition._] Here, to avoid confusion, a difference must be made\r\nbetween washing and cleansing.\r\n\r\nA thing which washeth, carries away by fluxion, as a man washeth the\r\ndirt off from a thing.\r\n\r\nA cleansing medicine by a certain roughness or nitrous quality, carries\r\naway the compacted filth with it.\r\n\r\nThis also is the difference between cleansing and discussing medicines,\r\nthe one makes thick humours thin, and so scatters them, but a cleansing\r\nmedicine takes the most tenacious humour along with it, without any\r\nalteration.\r\n\r\nBesides, of cleansing medicines, some are of a gentler nature, some are\r\nmore vehement.\r\n\r\nThese are not known one and the same way; for some are sweet, some\r\nsalt, and some bitter.\r\n\r\nThe use of cleansing is external, as the use of purges are internal.\r\n\r\nThey are used to cleanse the sanies and other filth of ulcers, yea, and\r\nto consume and eat away the flesh itself, as burnt Alum, _precipitate_,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nWhen these must be used, not only the effects of the ulcers, but also\r\nthe temperature of the body will tell you.\r\n\r\nFor if you see either a disease of fulness, which our physicians call\r\n[_Plethora_] or corrupted humours which they call [_Cacochyma_] you\r\nmust empty the body of these, viz. fulness by bleeding, and corrupt\r\nhumours, or evil state of the body, by purging before you use cleansing\r\nmedicines to the ulcer, else your cure will never proceed prosperously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n_Of Emplasters._\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Emplasters, here, I do mean things glutinative, and they are quite\r\ncontrary to things cleansing.\r\n\r\nThey are of a far more glutinous and tenacious substance.\r\n\r\nThey differ from things stopping because they do not stop the pores so\r\nmuch, as stick to them like Birdlime.\r\n\r\nThey have a certain glutinous heat, tempered both with coldness and\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\nFrom these plasters take their names.\r\n\r\nTheir taste is either none at all, or not discernable whether hot or\r\ncold, but fat, insipid, or without taste, or sweet, and viscous in\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nTheir use is to stop flowing of blood, and other fluxes, to cause\r\nsuppuration, to continue the heat, that so tumours may be ripened.\r\n\r\nAlso they are mixed with other medicines, that they may the better be\r\nbrought into the form of an emplaster, and may stick the better to the\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n_Of suppuring Medicines._\r\n\r\n\r\nThese have a great affinity with emolients, like to them in\r\ntemperature, only emolients are somewhat hotter.\r\n\r\nYet is there a difference as apparent as the sun when he is upon the\r\nmeridian, and the use is manifest. For,\r\n\r\nEmolients are to make hard things soft, but what suppures, rather makes\r\na generation than an alteration of the humour.\r\n\r\nNatural heat is the efficient cause of suppuration, neither can it be\r\ndone by any external means.\r\n\r\nTherefore such things are said to suppure, which by a gentle heat\r\ncherish the inbred heat of man.\r\n\r\nThis is done by such medicines which are not only temperate in heat,\r\nbut also by a gentle viscosity, fill up or stop the pores, that so the\r\nheat of the part affected be not scattered.\r\n\r\nFor although such things as bind hinder the dissipation of the spirits,\r\nand internal heat, yet they retain not the moisture as suppuring\r\nmedicines properly and especially do.\r\n\r\nThe heat then of suppuring medicines is like the internal heat of our\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nAs things then very hot, are ingrateful either by biting, as Pepper,\r\nor bitterness: in suppuring medicines, no biting, no binding, no\r\nnitrous quality is perceived by the taste, (I shall give you better\r\nsatisfaction both in this and others, by and by.)\r\n\r\nFor reason will tell a man, that such things hinder rather than help\r\nthe work of nature in maturation.\r\n\r\nYet it follows not from hence, that all suppuring medicines are\r\ngrateful to the taste, for many things grateful to the taste provokes\r\nvomiting, therefore why may not the contrary be?\r\n\r\nThe most frequent use of suppuration is, to ripen _Phlegmonæ_, a\r\ngeneral term physicians give to all swellings proceeding of blood,\r\nbecause nature is very apt to help such cures, and physic is an art to\r\nhelp, not to hinder nature.\r\n\r\nThe time of use is usually in the height of the disease, when the flux\r\nis stayed, as also to ripen matter that it may be the easier purged\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n_Of Medicines provoking urine._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe causes by which urine is suppressed are many.\r\n\r\n1. By too much drying, or sweating, it may be consumed.\r\n\r\n2. By heat or inflammation of the reins, or passages whereby it passes\r\nfrom the reins, it may be stopped by compression.\r\n\r\nUrine is the thinnest part of blood, separated from the thickest part\r\nin the reins.\r\n\r\nIf then the blood be more thick and viscous than ordinary, it cannot\r\neasily be separated without cutting and cleansing medicines.\r\n\r\nThis is for certain, that blood can neither be separated nor\r\ndistributed without heat.\r\n\r\nYet amongst diureticks are some cold things, as the four greater cold\r\nseeds, Winter-cherries, and the like.\r\n\r\nAlthough this seem a wonder, yet it may be, and doth stand with truth.\r\n\r\nFor cool diureticks, though they further not the separation of the\r\nblood one jot, yet they cleanse and purge the passages of the urine.\r\n\r\nDiureticks then are of two sorts:\r\n\r\n1. Such as conduce to the separation of the blood.\r\n\r\n2. Such as open the urinal passages.\r\n\r\nThe former are biting (and are known by their taste) very hot and\r\ncutting, whence they penetrate to the reins, and cut the gross humours\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nBitter things, although they be very hot, and cut gross humours, yet\r\nare they of a more dry and terrene substance than is convenient to\r\nprovoke urine.\r\n\r\nHence then we may safely gather, that bitter things are not so moist\r\nnor penetrating, as such as bite like Pepper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n_Of Medicines breeding flesh._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many things diligently to be observed in the cures of wounds\r\nand ulcers, which incur and hinder that the cure cannot be speedily\r\ndone, nor the separated parts reduced to their natural state.\r\n\r\n_Viz._ Fluxes of blood, inflammation, hardness, pain, and other things\r\nbesides our present scope.\r\n\r\nOur present scope is, to shew how the cavity of ulcers may be filled\r\nwith flesh.\r\n\r\nSuch medicines are called _Sarcoticks_.\r\n\r\nThis, though it be the work of nature, yet it is helped forward with\r\nmedicines, that the blood may be prepared, that it may the easier be\r\nturned into flesh.\r\n\r\nThese are not medicines which breed good blood, nor which correct the\r\nintemperature of the place afflicted, but which defend the blood and\r\nthe ulcer itself from corruption in breeding flesh.\r\n\r\nFor nature in breeding flesh produceth two sorts of excrements, viz.\r\nscrosus humours, and purulent dross.\r\n\r\nThose medicines then which cleanse and consume, these by drying are\r\nsaid to breed flesh, because by their helps nature performs that office.\r\n\r\nAlso take notice that these medicines are not so drying that they\r\nshould consume the blood also as well as the sanies, nor so cleansing\r\nthat they should consume the flesh with the dross.\r\n\r\nLet them not then exceed the first degree unless the ulcer be very\r\nmoist.\r\n\r\nTheir difference are various, according to the part wounded, which\r\nought to be restored with the same flesh.\r\n\r\nThe softer then, and tenderer the place is, the gentler let the\r\nmedicines be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n_Of glutinative Medicines._\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is the true cure of an ulcer which joins the mouth of it together.\r\n\r\nThat is a glutinative medicine, which couples together by drying and\r\nbinding, the sides of an ulcer before brought together.\r\n\r\nThese require a greater drying faculty than the former, not only to\r\nconsume what flows out, but what remains liquid in the flesh, for\r\nliquid flesh is more subject to flow abroad than stick to together.\r\n\r\nThe time of using them, any body may know without teaching, viz. when\r\nthe ulcer is cleansed and filled with flesh, and such symptoms as\r\nhinder are taken away.\r\n\r\nFor many times ulcers must be kept open that the sanies, or fords that\r\nlie in them may be purged out, whereas of themselves they would heal\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nOnly beware, lest by too much binding you cause pain in tender parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n_Of Medicines resisting poison._\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch medicines are called _Alexiteria_, and _Alexipharmaca_, which\r\nresist poison.\r\n\r\nSome of these resist poison by astral influence, and some physicians\r\n(though but few) can give a reason for it.\r\n\r\nThese they have sorted into three ranks:\r\n\r\n1. Such as strengthen nature, that so it may tame the poison the easier.\r\n\r\n2. Such as oppose the poison by a contrary quality.\r\n\r\n3. Such as violently thrust it out of doors.\r\n\r\nSuch as strengthen nature against poison, either do it to the body\r\nuniversally, or else strengthen some particular part thereof.\r\n\r\nFor many times one particular part of the body is most afflicted by\r\nthe poison, suppose the stomach, liver, brain, or any other part: such\r\nas cherish and strengthen those parts, being weakened, may be said to\r\nresist poison.\r\n\r\nSuch as strengthen the spirits, strengthen all the body.\r\n\r\nSometimes poisons kill by their quality, and then are they to be\r\ncorrected by their contraries.\r\n\r\nThey which kill by cooling are to be remedied by heating, and the\r\ncontrary; they which kill by corroding, are to be cured by lenitives,\r\nsuch as temper their acrimony.\r\n\r\nThose which kill by induration, or coagulation, require cutting\r\nmedicines.\r\n\r\nAlso because all poisons are in motion, neither stay they in one till\r\nthey have seized and oppressed the fountain of life, therefore they\r\nhave invented another faculty to stay their motion, viz. terrene and\r\nemplastic.\r\n\r\nFor they judge, if the poison light upon these medicines, they embrace\r\nthem round with a viscous quality.\r\n\r\nAlso they say the ways and passages are stopped by such means, to\r\nhinder their proceeding; take _Terra Lemnia_ for one.\r\n\r\nTruly if these reasons be good, which I leave to future time to\r\ndetermine, it may be done for little cost.\r\n\r\nSome are of opinion that the safest way is to expel the poison out of\r\nthe body, so soon as may be, and that is done by vomit, or purge, or\r\nsweat.\r\n\r\nYou need not question the time, but do it as soon as may be; for there\r\nis no parlying with poison.\r\n\r\nLet vomiting be the first, purging the next, and sweating the last.\r\nThis is general. But,\r\n\r\nIf thou dost but observe the nature and motion of the venom, that will\r\nbe thy best instructor.\r\n\r\nIn the stomach it requires vomiting, in the blood and spirits,\r\nsweating, if the body be plethoric, bleeding, if full of evil humours,\r\npurging.\r\n\r\nLastly, The cure being ended, strengthen the parts afflicted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n_Of purging Medicines._\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch jarring hath been amongst physicians about purging medicines,\r\nnamely, whether they draw the humours to them by a hidden quality,\r\nwhich in plain English is, they know not how; or whether they perform\r\ntheir office by manifest quality, viz. by heat, dryness, coldness, or\r\nmoisture: it is not my present scope to enter the lists of a dispute\r\nabout the business, neither seem it such an hidden thing to me that\r\nevery like should draw its like, only to make the matter as plain as I\r\ncan, I sub-divide this chapter into these following parts.\r\n\r\n    1. _Cautions concerning purging._\r\n    2. _Of the choice of purging medicines._\r\n    3. _Of the time of taking them._\r\n    4. _Of the correcting of them._\r\n    5. _Of the manner of purging._\r\n\r\n    _Cautions concerning purging._\r\n\r\nIn this, first consider diligently, and be exceeding cautious in it\r\ntoo, what the matter offending is, what part of the body is afflicted\r\nby it, and which is the best way to bring it out.\r\n\r\nOnly here, by the way, first, have a care of giving vomits, for they\r\nusually work more violently, and afflict the body more than purges do,\r\ntherefore are not fit for weak bodies; be sure the matter offending lie\r\nin the tunicle of the stomach, else is a vomit given in vain.\r\n\r\nVomits are more dangerous for women than men, especially such as are\r\neither with child, or subject to the fits of the mother.\r\n\r\nWhat medicine is appropriated to the purging of such a humour, for\r\nseeing the offending matter is not alike in all, the purging medicine\r\nought not to be the same to all. I shall speak more of this anon. As\r\nalso of the divers ways whereby medicines draw out or cast out humours,\r\n_viz._ by lenifying, cleansing, provoking nature to expulsion, and\r\n(which is stranger than the doctor’s _hidden quality_) some purge by\r\nbinding, but indeed, and in truth, such as are properly called purging\r\nmedicines, which, besides these faculties, have gotten another, by\r\nwhich they draw or call out the humours from the most remote parts\r\nof the body, whether these do it by heat or by an hidden quality,\r\nphysicians are scarce able to determine, it being very well known\r\nto modern physicians, though the ancients denied it, that many cold\r\nmedicines purge.\r\n\r\nThere is this faculty in all the purges of _Galen’s_ model, (because he\r\ngives the whole _simple_ which must needs consist of divers qualities,\r\nbecause the creation is made up of and consists by an harmony of\r\ncontraries) there is (I say) this faculty in all purges of that nature,\r\nthat they contain in them a substance which is inimical both to the\r\nstomach and bowels, and some are of opinion this doth good, namely,\r\nprovokes nature the more to expulsion; the reason might be good if\r\nthe foundation of it were so, for by this reason nature herself\r\nshould purge, not the medicine, and a physician should help nature\r\nin her business and not hinder her. But to forbear being critical,\r\nthis substance which I told you was inimical to the stomach, must be\r\ncorrected in every purge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    _CULPEPER’S LAST LEGACIES._\r\n\r\n    [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    _Select Medicinal Aphorisms and Receipts, for many diseases our frail\r\n    natures are incident to._\r\n\r\n    1. _A general Caution._\r\n\r\nLET such as love their heads or brains, either forbear such things\r\nas are obnoxious to the brain, as Garlick, Leeks, Onions, beware of\r\nsurfeiting and drunkenness.\r\n\r\n    2. _To purge the Head._\r\n\r\nThe head is purged by Gargarisms, of which Mustard, in my opinion, is\r\nexcellent, and therefore a spoonful of Mustard put into the mouth, is\r\nexcellent for one that is troubled with the lethargy: also the head is\r\npurged by sneezing; but be sure if you would keep your brain clear,\r\nkeep your stomach clean.\r\n\r\n    3. _For a rheum in the Head, and the Palsy._\r\n\r\nTake a red Onion, and bruise it well, and boil it in a little Verjuice,\r\nand put thereto a little clarified honey, and a great spoonful of good\r\nMustard, when it is well boiled, raise the sick upright, and let him\r\nreceive the smell up his nose twice a day, whilst it is very hot.\r\n\r\n    4. _For a rheum in the Head._\r\n\r\nBoil Pimpernel well in Wine, and drink a draught of the Wine in the\r\nevening, hot, but in the morning cold.\r\n\r\n    5. _Another._\r\n\r\nStew Onions in a close pot, and bathe the head and mouth, and nose\r\ntherewith.\r\n\r\n    6. _For the falling off of the Hair._\r\n\r\nBeat Linseeds very well, and mix them with Sallad-oil; and when you\r\nhave well mixed them, anoint the head therewith, and in three or four\r\ntimes using it will help you.\r\n\r\n    7. _To purge the Head._\r\n\r\nChew the root of Pellitory of Spain, and chew it on both sides of thy\r\nmouth, and as the rheum falls down into thy mouth, spit it out, but\r\nretain the root there still, till you think the head is purged enough\r\nfor that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FOR THE EYES, AND THEIR IMPEDIMENTS.\r\n\r\n    8. _For Eyes that are blasted._\r\n\r\nOnly wear a piece of black Sarcenet before thy eyes, and meddle with no\r\nmedicine; only forbear wine and strong drink.\r\n\r\n    9. _An excellent water to clear the Sight._\r\n\r\nTake of Fennel, Eyebright, Roses, white, Celandine, Vervain and Rue, of\r\neach a handful, the liver of a Goat chopt small, infuse them well in\r\nEyebright-water, then distil them in an alembic, and you shall have a\r\nwater will clear the sight beyond comparison.\r\n\r\n    10. _For a hurt in the Eye with a stroke._\r\n\r\nTake Agrimony, and bruise it very well, and temper it with white Wine,\r\nand the white of an egg: spread it pretty thick upon a cloth, like a\r\nplaster, and apply it to the outside of the eye-lid, and, although it\r\nbe almost out, it will cure it.\r\n\r\n    11. _To draw rheum back from the Eyes._\r\n\r\nTake an egg and roast it hard, then pull off the shell, and slit it in\r\ntwo, and apply it hot to the nape of the neck, and thou shalt find ease\r\npresently.\r\n\r\n    12. _For the web in the Eye._\r\n\r\nTake the gall of a hare, and clarified honey, of each equal\r\nproportions: mix them together, and lay it to the web.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FOR THE EARS, AND THEIR IMPEDIMENTS.\r\n\r\n    13. _For pain in the Ears._\r\n\r\nDrop a little oil of sweet Almonds into the ear, and it easeth the\r\npain instantly: (and yet oil of bitter Almonds is our doctor’s common\r\nremedy.)\r\n\r\n    14. _For an imposthume in the Ear._\r\n\r\nBoil some milk, and put it into a stone pot with a narrow mouth, and\r\nhold the sore ear over the pot whilst the milk is very hot, that the\r\nvapour of the milk may ascend into the ear: this is an often approved\r\nremedy to take away the pain, and break the imposthume.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FOR THE NOSE, AND ITS INFIRMITIES.\r\n\r\n    15. _For Polypus; or a fleshy substance growing\r\n    in the Nose._\r\n\r\nTake the juice of Ivy, and make a tent with a little cotton, the which\r\ndip in the juice and put it up in the nostril.\r\n\r\n    16. _To cleanse the Nose._\r\n\r\nSnuff up the juice of red Beet-root; it will cleanse not only the nose,\r\nbut also the head, this is a singular remedy for such as are troubled\r\nwith hard congealed stuff in their nostrils.\r\n\r\n    17. _For bleeding at the Nose._\r\n\r\nBind the arms and legs as hard as you can with a piece of\r\ntape-ribboning; that, perhaps, may call back the blood.\r\n\r\n    18. _For a Canker in the Nose._\r\n\r\nBoil strong ale till it be thick, if the Canker be in the outside of\r\nthe nose, spread it as a plaster, and apply it; if in the inside, make\r\na tent of a linen rag, and put it up the nostril.\r\n\r\n    19. _Another for the Polypus._\r\n\r\nThe water of Adder’s-tongue snuffed up the nose, is very good: but it\r\nwere better, in my opinion, to keep a rag continually moistened with it\r\nin the nose.\r\n\r\n    20. _For bleeding at the Nose._\r\n\r\nTake Amber and bruise into gross powder, put it upon a chafing-dish of\r\ncoals, and receive the smoke up into the nose with a funnel.\r\n\r\n    21. _Another._\r\n\r\nWhen no other means will stop the bleeding at the nose, it has been\r\nknown that it hath been stopped by opening a vein in the ear.\r\n\r\n\r\n    OF THE MOUTH, AND ITS DISEASES.\r\n\r\n    22. _A Caution._\r\n\r\nWhosoever would keep their mouth, or tongue, or nose, or eyes, or ears,\r\nor teeth, from pain or infirmities, let them often use sneezing, and\r\nsuch gargarisms as they were instructed in a preceding chapter; for,\r\nindeed, most of the infirmities, if not all, which infest those parts,\r\nproceed from rheum.\r\n\r\n    23. _For extreme heat of the Mouth._\r\n\r\nTake Rib-wort, and boil it in red Wine, and hold the decoction as warm\r\nin your mouth as you can endure it.\r\n\r\n    24. _For a Canker in the Mouth._\r\n\r\nWash the mouth often with Verjuice.\r\n\r\n\r\n    OF THE TEETH, AND THEIR MEDICINES.\r\n\r\n    25. _A Caution._\r\n\r\nIf you will keep your teeth from rotting, or aching, wash your mouth\r\ncontinually every morning with juice of Lemons, and afterwards rub your\r\nteeth either with a Sage-leaf, or else with a little Nutmeg in powder;\r\nalso wash your mouth with a little fair water after meats; for the only\r\nway to keep teeth sound, and free from pain, is to keep them clean.\r\n\r\n    26. _To keep Teeth white._\r\n\r\nDip a little piece of white cloth in Vinegar of Quinces, and rub your\r\ngums with it, for it is of a gallant binding quality, and not only\r\nmakes the teeth white, but also strengthens the gums, fastens the\r\nteeth, and also causeth a sweet breath.\r\n\r\n    27. _To fasten the Teeth._\r\n\r\nSeethe the roots of Vervain in old Wine, and wash your teeth often with\r\nthem, and it will fasten them.\r\n\r\n    28. _For the Tooth-ache._\r\n\r\nTake the inner rind of an Elder-tree, and bruise it, and put thereto a\r\nlittle Pepper, and make it into balls, and hold them between the teeth\r\nthat ache.\r\n\r\n\r\n    OF THE GUMS, AND THEIR INFIRMITIES.\r\n\r\n    29. _For a Scurvy in the gums._\r\n\r\nTake Cloves, and boil them in Rose-water, then dry them, and beat them\r\nto powder, and rub the gums with the powder, and drink the decoction in\r\nthe morning fasting an hour after it. Use red Rose-water, for that is\r\nthe best.\r\n\r\n    30. _For rotting and consuming of the gums._\r\n\r\nTake Sage-water, and wash your mouth with it every morning, and\r\nafterwards rub your mouth with a Sage-leaf.\r\n\r\n\r\n    OF THE FACE, AND ITS INFIRMITIES.\r\n\r\n    31. _The cause._\r\n\r\nIt is palpable, that the cause of redness and breaking out of the\r\nface, is a venomous matter, or filthy vapours ascending from the\r\nstomach towards the head; where meeting with a rheum or flegm thence\r\ndescending, mix with it, and break out in the face. Therefore let the\r\nfirst intention of cure be to cleanse the stomach.\r\n\r\n    32. _Caution negative._\r\n\r\nLet such as are troubled with red faces, abstain from salt meats, salt\r\nfish and herrings, drinking of strong beer, strong waters or Wine,\r\nGarlick, Onions, and Mustard.\r\n\r\n    33. _For a face full of red pimples._\r\n\r\nDissolve Camphire in Vinegar, and mix it, and the Vinegar with\r\nCelandine-water, and wash the face with it: this cured a maid in twenty\r\ndays, that had been troubled with the infirmity half so many years.\r\n\r\n    34. _To take away the marks of the small pox._\r\n\r\nTake the juice of Fennel, heat it lukewarm, and when the small Pox are\r\nwell scabbed, anoint the face with it divers times in a day, three or\r\nfour days together.\r\n\r\n\r\n    OF THE THROAT, AND ITS INFIRMITIES.\r\n\r\n    35. _A caution._\r\n\r\nDiseases in the throat, most commonly proceed of rheum descending from\r\nthe head upon the _trachea arteria_, or wind-pipe; in such cases there\r\nis many times no other cure than first to purge the body of flegm, and\r\nthen the head of rheum, as you were taught in the first chapter.\r\n\r\n    36. _For hoarseness._\r\n\r\nTake of sugar so much as will fill a common taster, then put so much\r\nrectified spirit of Wine to it as will just wet it, eat this up at\r\nnight going to bed, use this three or four times together.\r\n\r\n    37. _Another._\r\n\r\nIf the body be feverish, use the former medicine as before, only use\r\nOil of sweet Almonds, or for want of it, the best Salled-oil instead of\r\nspirit of Wine.\r\n\r\n    38. _Another._\r\n\r\nTake Penny-royal, and seethe it in running water, and drink a good\r\ndraught of the decoction at night going to bed, with a little sugar in\r\nit.\r\n\r\n    39. _For the Quinsey._\r\n\r\nTake notice that bleeding is good in all inflammations, therefore in\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nIt were very convenient that a syrup, and an ointment of Orpine were\r\nalways ready in the house for such occasions; for I know no better\r\nremedy for the Quinsey, than to drink the one, and anoint the throat\r\nwith the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n    OF WOMEN’S BREASTS, THEIR INFIRMITIES\r\n    AND CURES.\r\n\r\n    40. _For sore Breasts._\r\n\r\nTake a handful of Figs, and stamp them well till the kernels are\r\nbroken, then temper them with a little fresh grease, and apply them to\r\nthe breast as hot as the patient can endure; it will presently take\r\naway the anguish, and if the breast will break, it will break it, else\r\nit will cure it without breaking.\r\n\r\n    41. _An inward medicine for a sore Breast._\r\n\r\nLet her drink either the juice or decoction of Vervain: it were fit\r\nthat syrup were made of it to keep all the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n    OF THE STOMACH, AND ITS INFIRMITIES.\r\n\r\n    42. _A caution._\r\n\r\nInfirmities of the stomach usually proceed from surfeiting.\r\n\r\n    43. _Another._\r\n\r\nLet such as have weak stomachs, avoid all sweet things, as honey,\r\nsugar, and the like; milk, cheese and all fat meats: let him not eat\r\ntill he is hungry, nor drink before he is dry; let him avoid anger,\r\nsadness, much travel, and all fryed meats: let him not vomit by any\r\nmeans, nor eat when he is hot.\r\n\r\n    44. _For moisture of the Stomach._\r\n\r\nTake a drachm of Galanga, in powder, every morning in a draught of that\r\nWine you like best.\r\n\r\n    45. _For heat of the Stomach._\r\n\r\nSwallow four or five grains of Mastich every night going to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n    OF THE LIVER, AND ITS INFIRMITIES.\r\n\r\n    46. _A caution._\r\n\r\nIf the liver be too hot, it usually proceeds from too much blood, and\r\nis known by redness of urine, the pulse is swift, the veins great and\r\nfull, the spittle, mouth, and tongue, seem sweeter than they used to\r\nbe: the cure is letting blood in the right arm.\r\n\r\n    47. _To cause the Liver well to digest._\r\n\r\nTake Oil of Wormwood, and so much Mastich in powder as will make it\r\ninto a poultice, lay it warm to your right side.\r\n\r\n    48. _A caution._\r\n\r\nIf the liver be stopped, the face will swell, and you shall be as sure\r\nto have a pain in your right side, as though you had it there already.\r\n\r\n    49. _For stoppage of the Liver._\r\n\r\nUse Garden-thyme in all your drinks and broaths, it will prevent\r\nstoppages before they come, and cure them after they are come.\r\n\r\n    50. _For the liver._\r\n\r\nThe liver of a Hare dryed, and beaten into powder, cures all the\r\ndiseases of the liver of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FINIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

Due to the\r\nage of the manuscript, most spelling and hyphenation variations\r\nwere retained as printed. For example, if the reader is looking for\r\nanniseed, search also for annis-seed, aniseed and annis seed, etc.\r\nChanges made to the text are noted below. Only things that seemed to\r\nbe clearly typos instead of 1600s spelling variations were changed and\r\nnoted below. For example, text consistently uses “tertain” instead of\r\n“tertian.” Also watch for œ where one might expect æ and vice versa.\r\n“Bean” is often spelled as “Been.”\r\n\r\nOccasionally, items are out of alphabetical order. For example,\r\n_Malahathram_ is located in the beginning of the F section. This was\r\nretained as printed. At times, in long lists of names, certain plants\r\nare repeated and this was retained.\r\n\r\nMost but not all Latin terms are italicized. These were retained as\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\nSome section titles were formatted in a certain way with a change made\r\nmid-section. Each was retained as printed. For example at the end of\r\npage 283, the paragraph after the italic title that began with “Or”\r\nwas laid out as all other paragraphs. Two pages later, the paragraphs\r\nbeginning with “Or” were included with the italic centered title.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there are a few instances of unmatched parentheses that\r\nwere retained as printed for no clear location of the match could be\r\nascertained. An asterisk below indicates a blank or smudged place in\r\nthe original type.\r\n\r\nPage 4, “tartian” changed to “tertian” (tertian or quartan agues)\r\n\r\nPage 10, “CARDEN” changed to “GARDEN” (GARDEN ARRACH)\r\n\r\nPage 11, “then” changed to “than” (drier than the stinging)\r\n\r\nPage 12, “yon” changed to “you” (from it, if you will)\r\n\r\nPage 16 et seq., the first word of a description such as under BARBERRY\r\nand BARLEY, “The” changed to “THE” to match rest of book’s layout (THE\r\nshrub is so) (THE continual usefulness) and so on.\r\n\r\nPage 18, “helps” changed to “help” (provoke urine; help the mother)\r\n\r\nPage 19, “it” changed to “is” (that is to say, white, yellow)\r\n\r\nPage 20, “and” changed to “an” (being made into an oil)\r\n\r\nPage 20, “couses” changed to “causes” (long running causes)\r\n\r\nPage 22, “perishes” changed to “perish” (the stalks perish)\r\n\r\nPage 23, “Cesar” changed to “Cæsar” (of Octavius Cæsar)\r\n\r\nPage 29, “Scabions” changed to “Scabious” (those of Corn-Scabious)\r\n\r\nPage 29, “excellant” changed to “excellent” (excellent good to mollify)\r\n\r\nPage 30, “viens” changed to “veins” (of the veins which)\r\n\r\nPage 45, “speen” changed to “spleen” (liver, gall, and spleen, helps)\r\n\r\nPage 45, “frickles” changed to “freckles” (away all freckles, spots)\r\n\r\nPage 45, “offorded” changed to “afforded” (is afforded room in)\r\n\r\nPage 45, “Chery” changed to “Cherry” (gum of the Cherry-tree)\r\n\r\nPage 45, “horseness” changed to “hoarseness” (cough, and hoarseness of)\r\n\r\nPage 46, “keep” changed to “kept” (kept all the year)\r\n\r\nPage 46, “as” changed to “has” (This has little or no)\r\n\r\nPage 49, “colours” changed to “colour” (root is of a blackish brown\r\ncolour)\r\n\r\nPage 52, “IT” changed to “It” to conform to majority of usage in this\r\ncontext (_Place._] It grows in sundry)\r\n\r\nPage 52, “vain” changed to “vein” (any vein be swelled)\r\n\r\nPage 53, “Foals’s” changed to “Foal’s” (also Coughwort, Foal’s-foot)\r\n\r\nPage 56, “stays” changed to “stay” (stay fluxes of)\r\n\r\nPage 56, “think” changed to “thing” (without doing any thing)\r\n\r\nPage 56, “ounce” changed to “once” (Sun once a month)\r\n\r\nPage 56, word “and” removed from text.
