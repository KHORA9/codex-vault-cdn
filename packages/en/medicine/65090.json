SIR JAMES GRAHAM, BART.\r\n  HER MAJESTY’S PRINCIPAL SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Poor Law Commission Office, Somerset House,\r\n                                            9th July, 1842._\r\n\r\n  SIR,\r\n\r\nOn the 14th May, 1838, the Poor Law Commissioners presented to Lord John\r\nRussell a report “relative to certain charges which have been disallowed\r\nby the auditors of unions in England and Wales;” together with two\r\nsupplementary reports; one a “Report on the prevalence of certain\r\nPhysical Causes of Fever in the Metropolis, which might be removed by\r\nproper sanitary measures, by Neil Arnott, M.D., and James Phillips Kay,\r\nM.D.;” the other a “Report on some of the Physical Causes of Sickness\r\nand Mortality to which the Poor are peculiarly exposed, and which are\r\ncapable of removal by Sanitary Regulations exemplified in the present\r\ncondition of the Bethnal Green and Whitechapel Districts, as ascertained\r\non a personal inspection by Southwood Smith, M.D., Physician to the\r\nLondon Fever Hospital.” (See Fourth Annual Report, App. A, No. 1.)\r\n\r\nOn the 29th April, 1839, the Commissioners received from Dr. Southwood\r\nSmith a “Report on the prevalence of Fever in Twenty Metropolitan Unions\r\nor Parishes during the year ended the 20th March, 1838,” which they\r\nappended to their Fifth Annual Report. (App. C, No. 2.)\r\n\r\nIn August, 1839, Lord John Russell addressed the following letter to the\r\nCommissioners:—\r\n\r\n                                          _“Whitehall, August 21, 1839._\r\n\r\n  “GENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\n  “The Queen having been pleased to comply with the prayer of an humble\r\n  address presented to her Majesty, in pursuance of an order of the\r\n  House of Lords, dated 19th August, 1839, that ‘Her Majesty will be\r\n  pleased to cause inquiry to be made as to the extent to which the\r\n  causes of disease stated in the Appendix A, No. 1, of the Poor Law\r\n  Commissioners’ Fourth Annual Report, and Appendix C, No. 2, of their\r\n  Fifth Annual Report, to prevail amongst the labouring classes in the\r\n  metropolis, prevail also amongst the labouring classes in other parts\r\n  of England and Wales, and that Her Majesty will be graciously pleased\r\n  to cause the results of such inquiry to be communicated to the\r\n  House’—I have to desire that you will cause inquiry to be made\r\n  accordingly, and that you will prepare a report upon the result of\r\n  such inquiry, and transmit the same to me, in order that it may be\r\n  laid before the House of Lords.\r\n\r\n                                “I am, Gentlemen, your obedient servant.\r\n                                                          “J. RUSSELL.”\r\n\r\nWith the view of making the inquiry directed by Lord John Russell’s\r\nletter, we addressed, in the month of November following, an instruction\r\nto our Assistant Commissioners to report upon such parts of the subject\r\nas were likely to come under their observation. We likewise addressed\r\nletters to the several Boards of Guardians of Unions in England and\r\nWales, and their respective medical officers, requesting them to furnish\r\nus with information in answer to certain queries. (App. Nos. 1, 2, and\r\n3.)\r\n\r\nThe steps which we thus took for conducting the inquiry which we were\r\ninstructed to make have produced a large body of information, from which\r\nwe have selected for our present Report that portion which seemed to us\r\nmost important to the public, and most worthy of consideration by Her\r\nMajesty’s Government.\r\n\r\nFrom the reports transmitted to us by our Assistant Commissioners we\r\nsubjoin a report from Mr. Gilbert on the sanitary condition of the\r\nlabouring population in Devon and Cornwall: the reports from Mr. Mott\r\nand Mr. Power with relation to the sanitary condition of the population\r\nof Manchester and the adjacent manufacturing districts, which will be\r\nfound to be corroborative of the reports of Dr. Baron Howard and Dr.\r\nDuncan: one from Mr. Twisleton with relation to the sanitary condition\r\nof the population of Norfolk and Suffolk: one from Mr. Tufnell with\r\nrelation to the sanitary condition of the labouring population of Kent\r\nand Sussex: a report from Mr. Parker on the sanitary state of the\r\nlabouring population in the counties of Berks, Bucks, and Oxford: one\r\nfrom Mr. Weale on cottage accommodation in the counties of Bedford,\r\nNorthampton, and Stafford,—a report from Mr. Senior on the sanitary\r\ncondition of the labouring population in the counties of Leicester,\r\nLincoln, Nottingham, and Rutland: one from Sir Edmund Head on the\r\ndwellings of the labouring classes, and on the means of procuring better\r\ncottage accommodation in the counties of Gloucester, Hereford, Monmouth,\r\nSalop, Worcester, Brecknock, and Radnor; three reports from Sir John\r\nWalsham on the condition of the dwellings of the labouring population in\r\nDurham, Northumberland, Westmoreland, and Cumberland; and a\r\ncommunication from Mr. Day on the cost of erection, repairs, and rents\r\nof labourers’ cottages in Salop, Cheshire, and North Wales.\r\n\r\nWe have likewise received several valuable reports upon towns and\r\ndistricts in England from medical men resident upon the spot.\r\n\r\nWe have obtained a report from Mr. Hodgson and a committee of medical\r\ngentlemen of Birmingham on the sanitary condition of the labouring\r\npopulation in that town.\r\n\r\nWe also append a report on the sanitary condition of the dwellings of\r\nthe labouring classes, &c., in Manchester, which we have obtained from\r\nDr. Baron Howard, physician to the Ardwick and Ancoats Dispensary of\r\nthat town:\r\n\r\n  Also, one on the condition of the labouring population in Liverpool,\r\n    from Dr. Duncan.\r\n\r\n  One on the condition of the labouring population in Derby, from Dr.\r\n    Baker.\r\n\r\n  One on the condition of the labouring population of Truro, from Dr.\r\n    Barham.\r\n\r\n  One on the condition of the labouring population of Brighton, from Dr.\r\n    Jenks.\r\n\r\n  One on the sanitary condition of the labouring population in the town\r\n    of Wolverhampton, by Dr. Dehane.\r\n\r\n  One on the prevalence of fever in the parish of Breadsall, Derbyshire,\r\n    by Dr. Kennedy and Mr. Senior.\r\n\r\n  One on the sanitary state of the town of Stafford, by Dr. Edward\r\n    Knight.\r\n\r\n  One on an improved description of cottage tenements for the labouring\r\n    classes, by Mr. Edmund Ashworth.\r\n\r\n  One on the sanitary condition of the town of Lancaster, Dr. de Vitrié.\r\n\r\n  One on the sanitary condition of the town of Leeds, by Mr. Robert\r\n    Baker.\r\n\r\nThe detailed statements which we received from the Boards of Guardians,\r\nand the Union medical officers, were too voluminous for insertion at\r\nlength in the present Report; but we have caused them to be carefully\r\nexamined, and some of the most important results which they contained\r\nhave been extracted in the manner which we shall presently explain.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the inquiry which we were directed by Lord John\r\nRussell to make, in accordance with the address of the House of Lords,\r\nwas limited to England and Wales. Subsequently, however, we received\r\ninstructions from the Marquis of Normanby, dated 28th January, 1840,\r\ndirecting us to extend our inquiries to the causes of disease and\r\ndestitution amongst the working classes in Scotland.\r\n\r\nOn the receipt of these instructions, we caused a circular letter to the\r\nmedical practitioners to be sent to the provosts of all the Scotch\r\nburghs, with a request that they would put us in communication with the\r\nofficers of the medical charities and establishments within their\r\njurisdiction. In the same letter we stated fully the objects of the\r\ninquiry, and requested to be informed as to the general state of the\r\nmain sewers, drainage, &c., of the several towns. (Appendix, Nos. 4 and\r\n5.)\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, with a few exceptions, none of the medical profession are\r\nengaged in the public service as medical officers; and we were therefore\r\ncompelled to rely on the exertions of the private medical practitioners,\r\nfrom whom we received extensive, zealous, and efficient aid. The\r\nPresident of the College of Surgeons of Edinburgh communicated to us a\r\nresolution passed by that body, recommending that all members and\r\nlicentiates of the college should give every aid in their power to the\r\ninquiry into the sanitary condition of the poor. We directed additional\r\nqueries to be issued to the members of the college, from some of whom we\r\nreceived information similar to that obtained from the medical officers\r\nin England.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the sanitary state of towns and districts in Scotland,\r\nwe subjoin the following reports from medical gentlemen:—\r\n\r\n  A report from Dr. Arnott upon Edinburgh and Glasgow:\r\n\r\n  One report from Dr. Scott Alison on the sanitary condition of the\r\n    colliery population of Tranent, and the adjacent districts:\r\n\r\n  One report on the condition of the labouring population of Musselburgh\r\n    from Mr. Stevenson, surgeon:\r\n\r\n  One report on the condition of the labouring population of Ayr from\r\n    Dr. Sym:\r\n\r\n  One on the condition of the labouring population, Stirling, from Mr.\r\n    W. H. Forrest, surgeon:\r\n\r\n  One on the condition of the labouring population in Dumfries, from Dr.\r\n    M’Lellan:\r\n\r\n  One on the sanitary condition of the poor of Aberdeen, by Drs. Kilgour\r\n    and Galen:\r\n\r\n  One on the sanitary condition of the town of Lanark, by Mr. John\r\n    Gibson, surgeon:\r\n\r\n  One on the sanitary condition of the city of St. Andrews, by Mr.\r\n    Adamson, surgeon:\r\n\r\n  One on the sanitary state of the town of Greenock, by Dr. Laurie:\r\n\r\n  One on the sanitary condition of Tain and Easter Ross, by Mr. James\r\n    Cameron, surgeon.\r\n\r\n  We have likewise received a report on the sanitary condition of the\r\n    labouring population in Inverness, from Mr. Anderson, solicitor; and\r\n    one on the sanitary condition of the Old Town of Edinburgh, by Mr.\r\n    William Chambers.\r\n\r\nAs our inquiries led us to believe that considerable doubt exists as to\r\nthe provisions of the existing law of Scotland upon matters concerning\r\nthe public health, and as there is not in Scotland any local\r\nadministrative machinery similar to that of the English unions which can\r\nexercise a superintendence over the health of the working classes, we\r\nobtained the services of Mr. J. H. Burton, advocate of Edinburgh, to\r\nreport on the legal provisions existing in that city and in other parts\r\nof Scotland, and on the additional legislative measures which appeared,\r\nfrom the reports of the medical gentlemen, to be expedient for the\r\nimprovement of the sanitary condition of the population of that part of\r\nthe empire.\r\n\r\nWe also obtained the services of Mr. Charles R. Baird, of Glasgow,\r\nwriter to the signet, who was pointed out to our notice by the\r\ncircumstance of his having paid much attention to the condition of the\r\nlabouring population of that city to report on the powers with which the\r\nlocal authorities are at present invested by law, and the additional\r\npowers they may need for the protection of the health of the\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the letter of Lord John Russell, in accordance\r\nwith the address of the House of Lords to Her Majesty, merely directed\r\nus to make inquiry as to the extent to which the causes of disease,\r\nstated in the Reports of Drs. Arnott and Kay, and of Dr. Southwood\r\nSmith, to prevail amongst the labouring classes of the metropolis,\r\nprevail also amongst the labouring classes in other parts of England and\r\nWales, and to transmit the results of that inquiry to the Secretary of\r\nState for the Home Department. We should, therefore, have complied with\r\nthe letter of our instructions if we had merely laid before you the\r\ninformation which we have collected in answer to the inquiries which we\r\ncirculated. It appeared to us, however, that so large a mass of\r\nmiscellaneous evidence would not be likely to convey a distinct view of\r\nthe subject of inquiry if we presented it in an undigested form to Her\r\nMajesty’s Government; and we, therefore, requested our secretary, Mr.\r\nChadwick, to peruse the information which we had received, (including\r\nthe returns from the boards of guardians and union medical officers,)\r\nand, by comparing the different statements with such authentic facts\r\nbearing upon the question as he might collect from other sources, to\r\nframe a report which should exhibit the principal results of the inquiry\r\nwhich we were instructed to conduct. We subjoin the Report which Mr.\r\nChadwick has prepared in accordance with this request; and we present to\r\nyou this, and the other accompanying documents, in the full assurance\r\nthat, as they contain matters seriously concerning the welfare of the\r\ncommunity in general, and particularly of the working classes, they will\r\nreceive the attentive consideration of Her Majesty’s Government.\r\n\r\n                            We have the honour to be,\r\n                                            Sir,\r\n                                Your very faithful and obedient Servants\r\n                                  GEORGE NICHOLLS,\r\n                                  GEORGE CORNEWALL LEWIS,\r\n                                  EDMUND WALKER HEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n 1.—_Circular Letter of Instructions to the Assistant Commissioners in\r\n                               England._\r\n\r\n                             Poor Law Commission Office, Somerset House,\r\n                                         8th November, 1839.\r\n\r\nSir,—I am directed by the Poor Law Commissioners to call your attention\r\nto the following letter lately addressed to them by Lord John Russell.\r\n\r\n                                           Whitehall, August 21st, 1839.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,—The Queen having been pleased to comply with the prayer of\r\nan humble address presented to Her Majesty in pursuance of an Order of\r\nthe House of Lords, dated 19th of August, 1839, that ‘Her Majesty will\r\nbe pleased to cause inquiry to be made as to the extent to which the\r\ncauses of disease stated in the Appendix A., No. 1, of the Poor Law\r\nCommissioners’ Fourth Annual Report, and Appendix C., No. 2, of their\r\nFifth Annual Report, to prevail amongst the labouring classes in the\r\nmetropolis, prevail also amongst the labouring classes in other parts of\r\nEngland and Wales; and that Her Majesty will be graciously pleased to\r\ncause the results of such inquiry to be communicated to the House,’ I\r\nhave to desire that you will cause inquiry to be made accordingly, and\r\nthat you will prepare a report upon the results of such inquiry, and\r\ntransmit the same to me in order that it may be laid before the House of\r\nLords.\r\n\r\n                                       “I am, Gentlemen,\r\n                                               “Your obedient Servant,\r\n                                                           “J. RUSSELL.”\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners consider this the proper time for making arrangements\r\nto obtain the returns and information on which they may prepare a report\r\nto be submitted to the House of Lords in the ensuing Session of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners request your particular attention to the subject, as\r\none of great importance to the labouring classes, inasmuch as it may\r\nlead to the removal of the causes of prevalent and fatal diseases, and\r\nof consequent destitution and suffering.\r\n\r\nThe steps which the Commissioners propose to take for obtaining the\r\ninformation required by the order of the House of Lords, are:—\r\n\r\n1. To procure from the medical officers of unions returns of the number\r\nof cases of contagious or infectious disease, the spread of which within\r\ntheir respective districts has been promoted by the circumstances\r\nreferred to in the order of the House of Lords, with their observations\r\nthereon; for which purpose the Commissioners will issue the necessary\r\ncirculars to the medical officers.\r\n\r\n2. To obtain information from the Boards of Guardians of districts in\r\nwhich these diseases appear to have prevailed to a considerable extent,\r\nand where the guardians have applied to municipal or other authorities\r\nfor the removal of circumstances promoting the prevalence of such\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n3. In large towns, to request some physician,[1] or general practitioner\r\nof eminent reputation, to prepare a report (founded upon data obtained\r\nfrom the various dispensaries, infirmaries, fever hospitals, and other\r\nsimilar public establishments) respecting the circumstances promoting\r\nthe prevalence of contagious and infectious diseases in such large\r\ntowns.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners will be glad to receive from you the name of any\r\nphysician or general practitioner of sufficient eminence to obtain the\r\nrequisite data, and who will be willing to furnish them with such a\r\nreport in each of the towns in your district named in the margin.\r\n\r\n4. If the means already indicated should prove insufficient, to obtain a\r\nreport from yourself founded on personal examination, on spots where,\r\nfrom the returns or from other information, such examination by yourself\r\nor the medical officer of the district may appear necessary.\r\n\r\nSome of the chief considerations bearing upon the subject are set forth\r\nin the reports referred to in the resolution of the House of Lords, and\r\nif within your district there were any Boards of Health appointed during\r\nthe prevalence of the cholera, it is probable that their reports founded\r\non an examination of the condition of those classes amongst whom the\r\nprevalence of that disease was apprehended may furnish you with useful\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners wish further to observe that the state of the\r\ndwellings occupied by the labouring classes exercises an important\r\ninfluence upon their health, and the nature and frequency of the\r\ndiseases to which they are subject, as well as indirectly upon the moral\r\nstate of themselves and their families.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners therefore request you to investigate the state of the\r\ndwellings of the labouring classes in your district, both in towns and\r\nin the country, with reference to the following observations,—\r\n\r\nIt will be desirable generally, after informing yourself of the various\r\ndescriptions of cottage tenements in your district and the nature of the\r\naccommodation or comforts which they contain, to observe—\r\n\r\n1. What is the common cost of erection, and the average cost of\r\nrepairing each description of these cottage tenements.\r\n\r\n2. What are the rents paid by the labourers for each description of\r\nthese cottage tenements.\r\n\r\n3. What is the general proportion of the rent paid by the labourer to\r\nhis total expenditure.\r\n\r\nYou may find within your district instances where the employers of\r\nlabour (whether agricultural or manufacturing) have erected on their own\r\nlands tenements of an improved description for the residence of the\r\nlabourers employed by them. You are requested to take notice of all such\r\ninstances which may come before you, and examine them as standards of\r\ncomparison with other tenements of an inferior kind. You will inquire as\r\nto the comparative health and condition of the inmates, and whether the\r\nadvantage of improved dwellings has been observed to have any salutary\r\ninfluence on the moral habits of the inmates;—whether the increased\r\ncomforts of his house and home have tended to withdraw the labourer from\r\nthe beer-shop, and from the habits of improvidence to which it\r\nleads;—whether residents in separate and improved tenements are superior\r\nin condition, as compared with the labourers who hold merely lodgings,\r\nor who reside with other families in the same house.\r\n\r\nWhere you meet with remarkable instances of improved tenements of this\r\ndescription, you are requested to set them forth in your report, and\r\nobtain the loan of the plans or drawings of them, together with any\r\ninformation as to their cost and the probable returns in rent, and\r\nwhether on the whole (other advantages than the pecuniary return being\r\ntaken into consideration) they are deemed profitable; or what may be the\r\nextent of pecuniary loss upon them, or how far it may be countervailed\r\nby other considerations.\r\n\r\nAlthough the facts collected by you may not lead to the adoption of any\r\nlegislative remedies, the publication of successful examples may be\r\nuseful in stimulating to the voluntary adoption of them.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners wish you however to consider whether any legislative\r\nmeasure in the nature of a Building Act (_i. e._ an Act prescribing\r\ncertain rules to be followed in the building of cottages) would tend to\r\nintroduce generally the improvements which may have been adopted\r\npartially by public-spirited persons in your district.\r\n\r\nThis may be considered:—\r\n\r\n1. In the case of tenements intended for the residence of the labouring\r\nclasses in towns;\r\n\r\n2. In the case of cottage tenements in rural districts.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the former class of tenements, the wages of the labourers\r\nin towns being commonly double those earned in the rural districts, they\r\nmay be well able to afford to procure such an increase of comfort in\r\ntheir houses as may be obtained by means of a Building Act, even at the\r\ncost of an additional rent. You are also requested, in your observations\r\non this subject, to bear in mind another question, namely, the\r\nexpediency of exempting small tenements from the payment of rates, or\r\nwherever rents are collected weekly, of collecting the rates from the\r\nlandlord.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that the exemption from poor’s rate tends to\r\ndeteriorate the tenements of the labouring classes, inasmuch as many of\r\nsuch tenements are, for the purpose of obtaining the exemption, built of\r\nsuch quality and appearance as may bring them within the exempted class.\r\nIt has been further stated, that the benefit of the exemption goes to\r\nthe landlord, the rent for cottages built for letting in towns being\r\nvery high as compared with rents obtained for other house property, and\r\nthat such increased rents have been demanded expressly on the ground of\r\nexemption from rating. The causes affecting the construction of cottages\r\nare not expressly mentioned in the reports referred to in the resolution\r\nof the House of Lords, which treat chiefly of the external and\r\nimmediately-removable causes of disease, such as stagnant pools or other\r\nout-door nuisances with which the parochial officers had to some extent\r\nbeen heretofore accustomed to interfere. But the defective construction\r\nof the cottages themselves, and the imperfect protection they may afford\r\nagainst cold or damp—the want of means for the due regulation of warmth\r\nor of conveniences for cleanliness, may often be the causes of the\r\nprevalence of disease; and the Commissioners consider not only that\r\nthese subjects cannot with propriety be overlooked in any report on the\r\nsources of disease among the labouring classes, but that the beneficial\r\nmoral results which may arise from the suggestion of improvements in the\r\nhabitations of the labouring classes justify the Commissioners in taking\r\nthis occasion to direct your attention to the heads of inquiry which are\r\nnoticed in this communication.\r\n\r\n                               Signed, by Order of the Board,\r\n                                               E.

and in such cases, whether you have any suggestions\r\nto make as to the best means of diminishing the evil;—whether they are\r\ndrained or undrained, whether tight or otherwise;—whether there are good\r\nmeans of securing ventilation with a due regard to warmth;—whether there\r\nare accumulations of filth, and if so, whether they are ascribable to\r\nthe slovenly or indolent habits of the inmates, or to the want of proper\r\nreceptacles for refuse;—whether the occurrence of disease amidst this\r\npart of the population is regular or otherwise, and what are the seasons\r\nat which it appears, and its characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners request that you will favour them with any information\r\nwhich you may have gained in the course of your medical experience, as\r\nto the condition of the inmates of such residences;—whether there is a\r\nneed of superior cottage accommodation, or to what extent the\r\nimprovement of the residence would influence the habits beneficially;\r\nas, for example,—whether you have witnessed any beneficial effects on\r\nthe habits of the inmates by providing cottages with a day-room,\r\nscullery, pantry, three bed-rooms, and convenient receptacles for refuse\r\nand for fuel;—whether within your district there are other labourers of\r\nthe like class, who occupy improved tenements in a superior situation,\r\nand what is the general health and condition of the inmates as compared\r\nwith the general health and condition of the inmates less advantageously\r\nsituated;—whether you have seen any cottages constructed with a view to\r\nthe most economical management of fuel both in cooking and maintaining a\r\nproper temperature in the rooms;—and further, any observations that may\r\noccur to you on the subject of the health of the labouring classes in\r\nconnexion with what may appear to you to be available sanitary\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying portions of the report, and the appendix referred to in\r\ntheir lordships’ order, are transmitted for your information as to the\r\ncauses of disease existing in the metropolis, which it is deemed\r\nnecessary to investigate in other parts of the country.\r\n\r\n                                          Signed, by Order of the Board,\r\n                                          EDWIN CHADWICK, _Secretary_.\r\n\r\n  To the Medical Officer of the          District.\r\n\r\n  (COPY.)\r\n\r\n                                             Whitehall, August 21, 1839.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,—The Queen having been pleased to comply with the prayer of an\r\nhumble address presented to Her Majesty, in pursuance of an order of The\r\nHouse of Lords, dated 19th August, 1839, “that Her Majesty will be\r\npleased to cause inquiry to be made as to the extent to which the causes\r\nof disease stated in the Appendix A., No. 1, of the Poor Law\r\nCommissioners’ Fourth Annual Report, and Appendix C., No. 2, of their\r\nFifth Annual Report, to prevail amongst the labouring classes in the\r\nmetropolis, prevail also amongst the labouring classes in other parts of\r\nEngland and Wales;

the state of\r\nthe paving,—scavenging, and sewerage of such streets,—their width,—the\r\ndrainage of the houses,—their size,—their state of repair,—the number\r\nof families living under one roof,—the number living in cellars;—and\r\nother circumstances relating to the structure and situation of the\r\nhabitations of the poorer classes, and their habits, by which they may\r\nbe rendered more susceptible of the influence of contagion.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners would also be glad to obtain information whether the\r\nmain sewers of the town have been constructed in a satisfactory manner,\r\nand kept in good repair; and to what body, and with what powers this\r\nduty is confided;—whether there are any sanitary regulations of a local\r\ncharacter for the enforcement of the paving of streets, and of drainage\r\non the owners of houses erected within a reasonable distance of\r\nsewers;—whether any local body has power to interfere in the removal of\r\nany, and if so of what, nuisances injurious to health; or to cause\r\nlodging-houses, and dwellings liable to be infected with fever, to be\r\ncleansed and whitewashed from time to time, and by whom the expense of\r\nsuch interference is sustained.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners are further desirous of ascertaining whether the\r\nauthority possessed by the town council, or other local body intrusted\r\nwith the paving, scavenging, sewerage, the removal of nuisances and\r\nother causes of disease, are sufficient, or might in any respect be\r\nincreased with advantage to the sanitary condition of the town, and\r\nespecially of those parts of the town which are inhabited chiefly or\r\nexclusively by the working classes, and which are therefore\r\ncomparatively remote from the observation, and less subject to the\r\ninterference of the middle classes.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners will be glad to obtain from you or from the town\r\ncouncil of          any suggestions which you may be desirous to make on\r\nthe subject; and they trust they may have the benefit of your advice and\r\nassistance in the inquiry with which they are charged in the          of\r\n         and its suburbs.\r\n\r\n                    I have the honour to be, Sir,\r\n                                Your very obedient servant,\r\n                                            EDWIN CHADWICK, _Secretary_.\r\n\r\n  _To_\r\n      The Provost of\r\n\r\n\r\n   5.—_Circular Letter of Inquiry to Dispensary Surgeons and Medical\r\n                      Practitioners in Scotland._\r\n\r\n                             Poor Law Commission Office, Somerset House,\r\n                                     London, 19th June, 1840.\r\n\r\nSir,—The Poor Law Commissioners have been directed to extend to Scotland\r\nthe inquiry which in the past year they received Her Majesty’s commands\r\nto conduct in England, for the purpose of ascertaining what\r\ncircumstances in the condition of the poorer classes promote the spread\r\nof continued fever and other contagious febrile diseases.\r\n\r\nThey are desirous that this inquiry should be conducted with care in\r\nlarge towns, where the sources of contagion or the circumstances which\r\npromote its rapid diffusion among the population are more rife than in\r\nthe rural districts; they are anxious to obtain the assistance of the\r\nmedical practitioners having charge of hospitals and dispensaries in\r\nsuch towns, because such institutions afford the best means of observing\r\nunder what circumstances febrile contagious diseases are disseminated;\r\nof defining the districts of the town in which they spread; of\r\nascertaining the character of the streets and houses in such districts;\r\nthe comparative attention paid to the paving, sewerage, and drainage of\r\nthese districts; and whether or not they are subject to malarious\r\ninfluences.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the dwellings of the labouring classes; the nature and\r\nextent of their internal accommodation, and of the means for securing\r\ncleanliness, for removing filth, for promoting ventilation, and for\r\nproviding warmth with due economy, can be most easily ascertained by\r\nmedical gentlemen who devote their time to the frequently gratuitous\r\nservices of public institutions; they also are most competent to\r\ndiscriminate between the direct influence of the habits of the poorer\r\nclasses, and of the external circumstances by which they are surrounded,\r\non their sanitary condition; while on the other hand they will not be\r\nliable to fall into the error of supposing that these habits are\r\nindependent of arrangements which administer to domestic comfort.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners trust, therefore, they may rely with confidence on\r\nyour affording them your valuable assistance in the inquiry which they\r\nare directed to pursue. They trust you will permit them to suggest that\r\nif the cases recorded in the books of your hospital were grouped\r\naccording to the districts from which the patients were removed, you\r\nwould at once be able to define in a map those parts of your town most\r\nsubject to contagious febrile diseases, and to furnish the Commissioners\r\nwith the number of cases of each febrile disease occurring in each of\r\nthese districts, and would possess the means of ascertaining and\r\ndelineating the features of those districts in all that relates to the\r\nsanitary condition of the inhabitants, and to medical police. Besides\r\nthe general influences alluded to in the former part of this letter, you\r\nwill probably find it useful to ascertain whether any injurious\r\nconsequences are clearly attributable to certain classes of\r\nmanufactories surrounded by the habitations of the poor, to the location\r\nof slaughter-houses, tanneries, ancient burial grounds, &c., amidst\r\ndense masses of the population.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this inquiry it may be found necessary to distinguish\r\nthe extent of disease caused by physical or removable agencies, by\r\nmalaria created by defective drainage, or the bad construction of the\r\ndwellings of the labouring classes, from disease caused by destitution\r\nof the proper means of subsistence arising from poverty. It may be\r\nexpected of the medical practitioners from whom the Commissioners hope\r\nto obtain reports, that they will make the distinction wherever it is\r\nfound to exist.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners will value any suggestions you may have to offer\r\nrespecting the removal of the injurious agencies which may fall under\r\nyour observation. You are probably well acquainted with the nature of\r\nthe powers confided to the municipal authorities or other local bodies\r\nrespecting the paving, sewerage, and drainage of the town, and\r\nespecially of those parts of it which are inhabited chiefly or solely by\r\nthe working classes. The Commissioners request you to observe whether\r\nthose powers enable the municipal or other local body to complete the\r\nsewerage, and to enforce the paving and drainage of the streets\r\npartially or wholly at the expense of the proprietors of these houses.\r\n\r\nThe spread of contagious diseases is greatly facilitated in many towns\r\nby the extreme filth of lodging-houses to which mendicants and vagrants\r\nresort, and of the habitations of certain of the lowest portion of the\r\npoorer class; measures of medical police have been resorted to on the\r\noccurrence of epidemic fevers, and at the period of the invasion of\r\ncholera, for cleansing and whitewashing these habitations at the expense\r\nof the inhabitants. The Commissioners request you to state under what\r\ncircumstances you conceive such measures might be usefully resorted to,\r\nand under what superintendence, and whether the expense should fall on\r\nthe owners of such habitations or on the inhabitants generally, and\r\nwhether this interference should be habitual or casual.\r\n\r\nSuggestions have been made to the Commissioners that the nature of the\r\nthoroughfares, and the structure and internal arrangement of the\r\nbuildings in districts inhabited by the working classes in large towns\r\nwould be greatly improved if subject to the regulations of a Building\r\nAct enforced by the municipal authorities, or by a local board of\r\nhealth; they invite you to reflect on the provisions of such a law, and\r\nto state under what circumstances and to what extent you conceive such\r\ninterference desirable.\r\n\r\nGenerally the Commissioners are desirous to receive your impressions\r\nrespecting the means of improving the sanitary condition of the working\r\nclasses, especially in those parts of your town in which contagious\r\nfebrile diseases most frequently prevail.\r\n\r\nCopies of the forms and exemplifications of the mode of entering the\r\nparticulars of the information sought in the returns circulated in\r\nEngland, and the reports on the sanitary condition of the labouring\r\nclasses in the metropolis, are herewith transmitted for your use. The\r\nCommissioners have not asked for returns in any prescribed form from the\r\nmedical practitioners in the towns of Scotland, because they are\r\nuninformed as to the nature of the existing records of facts relating to\r\nmedical statistics in the towns, and they wish to consult the\r\npractitioners’ convenience, and be guided by them as to the best use to\r\nbe made of the local circumstances for obtaining information.\r\n\r\n                        I have the honour to be, Sir,\r\n                                    Your very obedient Servant,\r\n                                            EDWIN CHADWICK, _Secretary_.\r\n\r\n  _To_ ________\r\n\r\n\r\n   6.—_Form of General Queries addressed to Medical Practitioners and\r\n others for Information as to the Condition of the Labouring Classes in\r\n                               Scotland._\r\n\r\n1.

As to the internal economy of such residences, describe further,—\r\n\r\n(_a._) Whether they are unduly crowded, and several families or persons\r\noccupy the space which would properly suffice only for a less number?\r\n\r\n(_b._) Whether there are any inferior lodging-houses crowded by\r\nmendicants or vagrants?\r\n\r\n(_c._) Whether there is gross want of cleanliness in the persons or\r\nhabitations of certain classes of the poor?\r\n\r\n(_d._) Whether there is a habit of keeping pigs, &c., in\r\ndwelling-houses, or close to doors or windows?\r\n\r\n(_e._) Whether there is an indisposition to be removed to the hospitals\r\nwhen infected with contagious disease?\r\n\r\n7.

In company with\r\n  Dr. Arnott I visited Edinburgh and Glasgow, and inspected those\r\n  residences that were pointed out by the local authorities as the chief\r\n  seats of disease. I also visited Dumfries. An inspection of similar\r\n  districts in Spitalfields, Manchester, Leeds, and Macclesfield, and\r\n  inquiries formerly made under the Commission of Poor Law Inquiry, and\r\n  inspections of the condition of the residences of the poorer classes\r\n  in parts of Berkshire, Sussex, and Hertfordshire, had supplied me with\r\n  means of comparison. Abandoning any inquiries as to remedies, strictly\r\n  so called, or the treatment of diseases after their appearance, I have\r\n  directed the examinations of witnesses and the reports of medical\r\n  officers chiefly to collect information of the best means available as\r\n  preventives of the evils in question. On the documentary evidence of\r\n  the medical officers, and on the examinations of witnesses, aided by\r\n  personal inspections, I have the honour to report as follows:—\r\n\r\n  Partial descriptions of the condition of the labouring classes, in\r\n  respect to their residences and the habits which influence their\r\n  health, afford but a faint conception of the evils which are the\r\n  subject of inquiry. If only particular instances, or some groups of\r\n  individual cases be adduced, the erroneous impression might be created\r\n  that they were cases of comparatively infrequent occurrence. But the\r\n  following tabular return made up from the registration of the causes\r\n  of death in England and Wales, which is the most complete yet\r\n  attained, will give a sufficiently correct conception of the extent of\r\n  the evils in question, when illustrated by the evidence of\r\n  eye-witnesses, the medical officers whose duty it has been to attend\r\n  on the spot and alleviate them. The table comprehends the abstract of\r\n  the returns of the deaths from the chief diseases, which the medical\r\n  officers consider to be the most powerfully influenced by the physical\r\n  circumstances under which the population is placed—as the external and\r\n  internal condition of their dwellings, drainage, and ventilation.\r\n\r\n  _To the Poor Law Commissioners._\r\n\r\n        _Deaths in Counties from Diseases governed by Locality._\r\n\r\n ┌───────────┬───────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n │           │                                       │\r\n │           │                                       │\r\n │           │                                       │\r\n │           │                                       │\r\n │ COUNTIES. │Number of Deaths during the Year ended │\r\n │           │        31st December, 1838 from       │\r\n │           │                                       │\r\n │           │                                       │\r\n │           │                                       │\r\n │           ├───────────────────────────────────────┤\r\n │           │                                       │\r\n │           │                                       │\r\n │           │                   1                   │\r\n │           │   Epidemic, Endemic, and Contagious   │\r\n │           │               Diseases.               │\r\n │           │                                       │\r\n │           │                                       │\r\n │           ├───────────┬──────────┬────────┬───────┤\r\n │           │  Fever:   │          │        │Hooping│\r\n │           │  Typhus,  │Small-pox.│Measles.│Cough. │\r\n │           │Scarlatina.│          │        │       │\r\n ├───────────┼───────────┼──────────┼────────┼───────┤\r\n │ ENGLAND.  │           │          │        │       │\r\n │Bedford    │        155│        75│      40│     66│\r\n │Berks      │        204│       288│      21│     86│\r\n │Bucks      │        256│        85│      61│     27│\r\n │Cambridge  │        231│       136│      57│     90│\r\n │Chester    │        592│       279│     178│     87│\r\n │Cornwall   │        443│       135│     168│    491│\r\n │Cumberland │        165│       188│      11│     83│\r\n │Derby      │        394│        77│      79│     71│\r\n │Devon      │        615│       460│     287│    312│\r\n │Dorset     │        137│       255│      80│     58│\r\n │Durham     │        347│       316│     139│    304│\r\n │Essex      │        417│       460│      83│    163│\r\n │Gloucester │        352│       457│     440│    244│\r\n │Hereford   │         84│        83│      17│     36│\r\n │Hertford   │        160│       116│      45│     48│\r\n │Huntingdon │         61│        18│       1│     17│\r\n │Kent       │        955│       510│     169│    214│\r\n │Lancaster  │       2866│      1628│     898│    910│\r\n │Leicester  │        273│        98│      17│     70│\r\n │Lincoln    │        370│       138│      29│     88│\r\n │Middlesex  │       4422│      3359│     487│   1749│\r\n │Monmouth   │        328│       321│      49│     91│\r\n │Norfolk    │        515│       126│      63│    109│\r\n │Northampt^n│        348│       148│      36│     36│\r\n │Northumb^d │        366│       149│      46│    113│\r\n │Nottingham │        222│        73│      18│     80│\r\n │Oxford     │        222│        81│      51│     59│\r\n │Rutland    │         11│         2│        │     13│\r\n │Salop      │        213│       154│     112│    138│\r\n │Somerset   │        560│       710│     401│     46│\r\n │Southampt^n│        454│       164│      78│    148│\r\n │Stafford   │        610│       249│     182│    268│\r\n │Suffolk    │        480│       325│      53│    158│\r\n │Surrey     │       1348│       814│     177│    565│\r\n │Sussex     │        391│        80│     159│     88│\r\n │Warwick    │        454│       415│     153│    164│\r\n │Westmorel^d│         41│        40│       6│     41│\r\n │Wilts      │        246│       259│     263│    140│\r\n │Worcester  │        381│       305│     122│    258│\r\n │York, E.

These deaths are exclusive of the deaths from old age, which\r\namounted to 35,564, and the deaths from violence, which amounted to\r\n12,055. The deaths from causes not specified were 11,970. The total\r\namount of deaths was 342,529 for that year. In the year following the\r\ntotal deaths were 338,979, of which the registered deaths from old age\r\nwere 35,063, and the deaths from violence 11,980. The proportion of\r\ndeaths for the whole population was 21 per thousand.\r\n\r\nIt appears that fever, after its ravages amongst the infant population,\r\nfalls with the greatest intensity on the adult population in the vigour\r\nof life. The periods at which the ravages of the other diseases,\r\nconsumption, small-pox, and measles take place, are sufficiently well\r\nknown. The proportions in which the diseases have prevailed in the\r\nseveral counties will be found deserving of peculiar attention.\r\n\r\nA conception may be formed of the aggregate effects of the several\r\ncauses of mortality from the fact, that of the deaths caused during one\r\nyear in England and Wales by epidemic, endemic, and contagious diseases,\r\nincluding fever, typhus, and scarlatina, amounting to 56,461, the great\r\nproportion of which are proved to be preventible, it may be said that\r\nthe effect is as if the whole county of Westmoreland, now containing\r\n56,469 souls, or the whole county of Huntingdonshire, or any other\r\nequivalent district, were entirely depopulated annually, and were only\r\noccupied again by the growth of a new and feeble population living under\r\nthe fears of a similar visitation. The annual slaughter in England and\r\nWales from preventible causes of typhus which attacks persons in the\r\nvigour of life, appears to be double the amount of what was suffered by\r\nthe Allied Armies in the battle of Waterloo. It will be shown that\r\ndiseases such as those which now prevail on land, did within the\r\nexperience of persons still living, formerly prevail to a greater extent\r\nat sea, and have since been prevented by sanitary regulations; and that\r\nwhen they did so prevail in ships of war, the deaths from them were more\r\nthan double in amount of the deaths in battle. But the number of persons\r\nwho die is to be taken also as the indication of the much greater number\r\nof persons who fall sick, and who, although they escape, are subjected\r\nto the suffering and loss occasioned by attacks of disease. Thus it was\r\nfound on the original inquiry in the metropolis, that the deaths from\r\nfever amounted to 1 in 10 of the number attacked. If this proportion\r\nheld equally throughout the country, then a quarter of a million of\r\npersons will have been subjected to loss and suffering from an attack of\r\nfever during the year; and in so far as the proportions of attacks to\r\ndeaths is diminished, so it appears from the reports is the intensity\r\nand suffering from the disease generally increased. It appears that the\r\nextremes of mortality at the Small-pox Hospital, in London, amongst\r\nthose attacked, have been 15 per cent. and 42 per cent. But if,\r\naccording to other statements, the average mortality be taken at 1 in 5,\r\nor 20 per cent., the number of persons attacked in England and Wales\r\nduring the year of the return, must amount to upwards of 16,000 persons\r\nkilled, and more than 80,000 persons subjected to the sufferings of\r\ndisease, including, in the case of the labouring classes, the loss of\r\nlabour and long-continued debility; and in respect to all classes, often\r\npermanent disfigurement, and occasionally the loss of sight.\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent part of this report, evidence will be adduced to show in\r\nwhat proportion these causes of death fall upon the poorer classes as\r\ncompared with the other classes of society inhabiting the same towns or\r\ndistricts, and in what proportions the deaths fall amongst persons of\r\nthe same class inhabiting districts differently situated.\r\n\r\nThe first extracts present the subjects of the inquiry in their general\r\ncondition under the operation of several causes, yet almost all will be\r\nfound to point to one particular, namely, atmospheric impurity,\r\noccasioned by means within the control of legislation, as the main cause\r\nof the ravages of epidemic, endemic, and contagious diseases among the\r\ncommunity, and as aggravating most other diseases. The subsequent\r\nextracts from the sanitary reports from different places will show that\r\nthe impurity and its evil consequences are greater or less in different\r\nplaces, according as there is more or less sufficient drainage of\r\nhouses, streets, roads, and land, combined with more or less sufficient\r\nmeans of cleansing and removing solid refuse and impurities, by\r\navailable supplies of water for the purpose. Then will follow the\r\ndescription of the effects of overcrowding the places of work and\r\ndwellings, including the effects of the defective ventilation of\r\ndwelling-houses, and of places of work where there are fumes or dust\r\nproduced. To these will be added the information collected as to the\r\ngood or evil moral habits promoted by the nature of the residence. These\r\nwill form so many successive sections of the report, and will be\r\nfollowed by information in respect to the means available for the\r\nprevention of the evils described, and an exposition of the present\r\nstate of the law for the protection of the public health, and of\r\nmodifications apparently requisite to secure the desired results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n I.—GENERAL CONDITION OF THE RESIDENCES OF THE LABOURING CLASSES WHERE\r\n               DISEASE IS FOUND TO BE THE MOST PREVALENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following extracts will serve to show, in the language chiefly of\r\neye-witnesses, the varied forms in which disease attendant on removable\r\ncircumstances appears from one end of the island to the other amidst the\r\npopulation of rural villages, and of the smaller towns, as well as\r\namidst the population of the commercial cities and the most thronged of\r\nthe manufacturing districts—in which last pestilence is frequently\r\nsupposed to have its chief and almost exclusive residence.\r\n\r\nCommencing with the reports on the sanitary condition of the population\r\nin Cornwall and Devon, _Mr. Gilbert_, when acting as Assistant\r\nCommissioner for those counties, reports, that he found the open drains\r\nand sewers the most prominent cause of malaria. He gives the following\r\nas an instance of the common condition of the dwellings of the labouring\r\nclasses in Devon, where it will be observed that the registered deaths\r\nfrom the four classes of disease amounted in one year to 5893 cases.\r\n\r\n  “In Tiverton there is a large district, from which I find numerous\r\n  applications were made for relief to the Board of Guardians, in\r\n  consequence of illness from fever. The expense in procuring the\r\n  necessary attention and care, and the diet and comforts recommended by\r\n  the medical officer, were in each case very high, and particularly\r\n  attracted my attention.\r\n\r\n  “I requested the medical officer to accompany me through the district,\r\n  and with him, and afterwards by myself, I visited the district, and\r\n  examined the cottages and families living there. The land is nearly on\r\n  a level with the water, the ground is marshy, and the sewers all open.\r\n  Before reaching the district, I was assailed by a most disagreeable\r\n  smell; and it was clear to the sense that the air was full of most\r\n  injurious malaria. The inhabitants, easily distinguishable from the\r\n  inhabitants of the other parts of the town, had all a sickly,\r\n  miserable appearance. The open drains in some cases ran immediately\r\n  before the doors of the houses, and some of the houses were surrounded\r\n  by wide open drains, full of all the animal and vegetable refuse not\r\n  only of the houses in that part, but of those in other parts of\r\n  Tiverton. In many of the houses, persons were confined with fever and\r\n  different diseases, and all I talked to either were ill or had been\r\n  so: and the whole community presented a melancholy spectacle of\r\n  disease and misery.\r\n\r\n  “Attempts have been made on various occasions by the local authorities\r\n  to correct this state of things by compelling the occupants of the\r\n  houses to remove nuisances, and to have the drains covered; but they\r\n  find that in the present state of the law their powers are not\r\n  sufficient, and the evil continues and is likely so to do, unless the\r\n  legislature affords some redress in the nature of sanitary powers.\r\n  Independently of this nuisance, Tiverton would be considered a fine\r\n  healthy town, situate as it is on the slope of a hill, with a swift\r\n  river running at its foot.\r\n\r\n  “It is not these unfortunate creatures only who choose this centre of\r\n  disease for their living-place who are affected; but the whole town is\r\n  more or less deteriorated by its vicinity to this pestilential mass,\r\n  where the generation of those elements of disease and death is\r\n  constantly going on.\r\n\r\n  “Another cause of disease is to be found in the state of the cottages.\r\n  Many are built on the ground without flooring, or against a damp hill.\r\n  Some have neither windows nor doors sufficient to keep out the\r\n  weather, or to let in the rays of the sun, or supply the means of\r\n  ventilation; and in others the roof is so constructed or so worn as\r\n  not to be weather tight. The thatch roof frequently is saturated with\r\n  wet, rotten, and in a state of decay, giving out malaria, as other\r\n  decaying vegetable matter.”\r\n\r\nThe report of _Dr. Barham_, on the sanitary condition of the town of\r\nTruro, gives instances of the condition of the town population in that\r\npart of the country. He states—\r\n\r\n  “The perfect immunity from deaths by _febrile_ and _acute_ diseases,\r\n  enjoyed by Lemon-street during the long period of three years and a\r\n  half, is a strong testimony to the value of the breadth of its\r\n  roadway, the openness of its site, and the judicious construction of\r\n  the houses; for it has to contend with a great deficiency of sewerage.\r\n  Fairmantle and Daniell-streets are modern, and are occupied by small\r\n  traders, and by decent artisans and labourers; the _former_ lies\r\n  rather low, the _latter_ is on a considerable elevation; both are\r\n  fairly drained, and are healthy. Charles, Calenick, and Kenwyn-streets\r\n  present some of the worst specimens of defective arrangement, rendered\r\n  worse still by the recklessness of the very poor, which can be met\r\n  with in Truro. The amount of _pauper sickness_ is considerable, the\r\n  deaths not few. The two latter streets are, in the greater part of\r\n  their length, but little raised above high-water mark. Passing into\r\n  _St. Mary’s_ parish, the proportion of sickness and even of deaths in\r\n  Castle-street and Castle-hill is, to their extent and population, as\r\n  great, perhaps, as that of any part of Truro; yet their situation is\r\n  elevated and favourable. There is, however, no mystery in the\r\n  causation. Ill-constructed houses, many of them old, with decomposing\r\n  refuse close upon their doors and windows, open drains bringing the\r\n  oozings of pigsties and other filth to stagnate at the foot of a wall,\r\n  between which and the entrances to a row of small dwellings there is\r\n  only a very narrow passage; such are a few of the sources of disease\r\n  which the breeze of the hill cannot always dissipate. Similar causes\r\n  have produced like effects in the courts adjacent to Pyder-street, to\r\n  the High Cross, and to St. Clement’s-streets, and in Bodmin-street and\r\n  Good-wives’-lane, the situations being all more or less confined. The\r\n  benefits, on the other hand, derived from open rows, and cottages of a\r\n  better construction are evidenced in Boscawen and Paul’s-row, and St.\r\n  Clements’-terrace, which are well ventilated, and consequently suffer\r\n  less from the scanty provision of drains and other conveniences.\r\n\r\n  “A detailed account of the public sewers is given in the Appendix, and\r\n  is believed to be nearly, if not quite, complete. Many of these are of\r\n  recent date, and owe their existence to the alarm excited when the\r\n  cholera was near at hand. Some of them are made to discharge\r\n  themselves into the rivers; and such of these as are swept by a stream\r\n  of water are unobjectionable in themselves. Several others stop short\r\n  of this desirable termination, and, after collecting filth from\r\n  various localities, deposit a portion in catch-pits here and there,\r\n  and finally open on the surface, frequently in some street or lane,\r\n  where a neglected deposit of a mixed animal and vegetable nature is\r\n  allowed to become a probable source of annoyance or mischief. Much of\r\n  this incompleteness may be removed (as regards the main lines of\r\n  sewerage) at no great expense; and it is said to be the intention of\r\n  the commissioners of improvement to remedy the deficiency, when they\r\n  are free from the debt with which they are now encumbered. Many of the\r\n  smaller sewers are, however, much too narrow to be effective, and some\r\n  of them are no better than covered drains. But the greatest evils in\r\n  this department are unquestionably those which spring from the\r\n  ignorance, cupidity, or negligence of landlords. It is useless to have\r\n  a good sewer carried through the centre of a street, if the houses at\r\n  the sides, and still more those situated in courts and lanes\r\n  adjoining, have no communicating drains; and it is worse than useless\r\n  to furnish these backlets with the mere semblance of drains—gutters\r\n  forming pits here and there—then as they approach the street, perhaps\r\n  slightly covered so as to produce obstruction more frequently than\r\n  protection, a concentrated solution of all sorts of decomposing refuse\r\n  being allowed to soak through and thoroughly impregnate the walls and\r\n  ground adjoining. One or more of these mischievous conditions is to be\r\n  found in connexion with a large proportion of the older houses in\r\n  Truro, excepting the better class; and in many of the courts and\r\n  backlets all these evils are in full operation. I have repeatedly\r\n  noticed in the country that the occurrence of fever has been connected\r\n  with _near proximity to even a small amount of decomposing organic\r\n  matter_; and it is certain that all measures for effecting improvement\r\n  in the sewerage of streets, the supply of water, and ventilation, may\r\n  be rendered nearly inoperative for the obviating of the causes of\r\n  disease, if a little nidus of morbific effluvia be permitted to remain\r\n  in almost every corner of the confined court; where the poor man opens\r\n  his narrow habitation in the hope of refreshing it with the breeze of\r\n  summer, but gets instead a mixture of gases from reeking dunghills,\r\n  or, what is worse, because more insidious, from a soil which has\r\n  become impregnated with organic matters imbibed long before; and now,\r\n  though, perhaps, to all appearance dry and clean, emitting the\r\n  poisonous vapour in its most pernicious state. Nothing short of the\r\n  placing in proper hands a peremptory authority for the removal of what\r\n  is hurtful, and the supply of what is defective, making the exercise\r\n  of that authority a duty, can remedy the existing evils.\r\n\r\n  “The houses occupied by the lower orders do not often exceed two\r\n  stories in height, and it is rare to find families occupying less than\r\n  two rooms. The more recent additions to the town—I speak of residences\r\n  of the humbler class—have mainly consisted of rows of moderate\r\n  cottages, having, the majority of them, gardens in front, and usually\r\n  containing four rooms, commonly occupied by a single family. Some\r\n  instances have, however, occurred of the building of a very inferior\r\n  class of dwellings, which will be hereafter pointed out.\r\n\r\n  “No interments now take place in the town, the present burying-ground\r\n  being at the distance of a third of a mile to the north of the church.\r\n  The slaughter-houses are all, or nearly all, situated in populous\r\n  parts, and occasionally constitute a decided nuisance. No\r\n  manufactories exist which can be looked upon as prejudicial from any\r\n  effluvia to which they give rise. The gas-works and smelting-houses\r\n  are so placed that no mischievous effects can fairly be attributed to\r\n  them.”\r\n\r\nThe state of the dwellings of many of the agricultural labourers in\r\nDorset, where the deaths from the four classes of disease bear a similar\r\nproportion to those in Devon, is described in the return of _Mr. John\r\nFox_, the medical officer of the Cerne union, who, remarking upon some\r\ncases of disease among the poor whom he had attended, says,—\r\n\r\n  “These cases (of diarrhœa and common fever) occurred in a house\r\n  (formerly a poor house) occupied by nearly 50 persons on the\r\n  ground-floor; the rooms are neither boarded nor paved, and generally\r\n  damp; some of them are occupied by two families. The up-stairs rooms\r\n  are small and low, and separated from each other by boards only.\r\n  Eleven persons slept in one room. The house stands in a valley between\r\n  two hills, very little above the level of the river, which\r\n  occasionally overflows its banks, and within a few yards of it. There\r\n  is generally an accumulation of filth of every description in a gutter\r\n  running about two feet from its front, and a large cesspool within a\r\n  few feet behind. The winter stock of potatoes was kept in some of the\r\n  day-rooms, and generally put away in a wet state. The premises had not\r\n  been white-limed during three years; in addition to this state of\r\n  things, the poor were badly fed, badly clothed, and many of them\r\n  habitually dirty, and consequently typhus, synochus, or diarrhœa,\r\n  constantly prevailed. No house-rent was paid by the occupants. Many,\r\n  under more favourable circumstances were clean and tidy, and if their\r\n  wages were sufficient to enable them to rent a decent cottage, I have\r\n  no doubt they would soon regain their lost spirit of cleanliness. In\r\n  this same parish I have often seen the springs bursting through the\r\n  _mud_ floor of some of the cottages, and little channels cut from the\r\n  centre under the doorways to carry off the water, whilst the door has\r\n  been removed from its hinges for the children to put their feet on\r\n  whilst employed in making buttons. Is it surprising that fever and\r\n  scrofula in all its forms prevail under such circumstances?\r\n\r\n  “It is somewhat singular that seven cases of typhus occurred in one\r\n  village heretofore famed for the health and general cleanliness of its\r\n  inhabitants and cottages. The first five cases occurred in one family,\r\n  in a detached house on high and dry ground, and free from\r\n  accumulations of vegetable or animal matter. The cottage was\r\n  originally built for a school-room, and consists of one room only,\r\n  about 18 feet by 10, and 9 high. About one-third part was partitioned\r\n  off by boards reaching to within three feet of the roof, and in this\r\n  small space were three beds, in which six persons slept; had there\r\n  been two bed-rooms attached to this one day-room, these cases of\r\n  typhus would not have occurred. The fatal case of typhus occurred in a\r\n  very small village, containing about sixty inhabitants, and from its\r\n  locality it appears favourable to the production of typhus, synochus,\r\n  and acute rheumatism. It stands between two hills, with a river\r\n  running through it, and is occasionally flooded. It has extensive\r\n  water meadows both above and below, and a farm-yard in the centre,\r\n  where there is always a large quantity of vegetable matter undergoing\r\n  decomposition. Most of the cases of synochus occurred under\r\n  circumstances favourable to its production. Most of the cottages being\r\n  of the worst description, some mere mud hovels, and situated in low\r\n  and damp places with cesspools or accumulations of filth close to the\r\n  doors. The _mud floors_ of many are much below the level of the road,\r\n  and in wet seasons are little better than so much clay. The following\r\n  shocking case occurred in my practice. In a family consisting of six\r\n  persons, two had fever; the mud floor of their cottage was at least\r\n  one foot below the lane; it consisted of _one_ small room only, in the\r\n  centre of which stood a foot-ladder reaching to the edge of a platform\r\n  which extended over nearly one-half of the room, and upon which were\r\n  placed two beds, with space between them for one person only to stand,\r\n  whilst the outside of each touched the thatch. The head of one of\r\n  these beds stood within six inches of the edge of the platform, and in\r\n  this bed one of my unfortunate patients, a boy about 11 years old, was\r\n  sleeping with his mother, and in a fit of delirium jumped over the\r\n  head of his bed and fell to the ground below, a height of about seven\r\n  feet. The injury to the head and spine was so serious that he lived a\r\n  few hours only after the accident. In a cottage fit for the residence\r\n  of a human being this could not have occurred. In many of the\r\n  cottages, also, where synochus prevailed, the beds stood on the\r\n  ground-floor, which was damp three parts of the year; scarcely one had\r\n  a fire-place in the bed-room, and one had a single small pane of glass\r\n  stuck in the mud wall as its only window, with a large heap of wet and\r\n  dirty potatoes in one corner. Persons living in such cottages are\r\n  generally very poor, very dirty, and usually in rags, living almost\r\n  wholly on bread and potatoes, scarcely ever tasting animal food, and\r\n  consequently highly susceptible of disease and very unable to contend\r\n  with it. I am quite sure if such persons were placed in good,\r\n  comfortable, clean cottages, the improvement in themselves and\r\n  children would soon be visible, and the exceptions would only be found\r\n  in a few of the poorest and most wretched, who perhaps had been born\r\n  in a mud hovel, and had lived in one the first 30 years of their\r\n  lives.\r\n\r\n  “In my district I do not think there is _one_ cottage to be found\r\n  consisting of a day-room, three bed-rooms, scullery, pantry, and\r\n  convenient receptacles for refuse and for fuel in the occupation of a\r\n  labourer, but there are many consisting of a day-room and two\r\n  bed-rooms, constructed with a due regard to ventilation and warmth,\r\n  pantry, and fuel house, with a small garden and pigsty adjoining, and\r\n  the labourers occupying such cottages, generally speaking, are far\r\n  superior to others less advantageously situated. Their persons and\r\n  cottages are always neater and cleaner, they are less disposed to\r\n  frequent the beer-houses or to engage in poaching, whilst their\r\n  children are generally sent daily to some school, in many instances\r\n  chiefly supported by the clergyman of the parish. As a corroboration\r\n  of my opinion, I need only state that I am frequently employed by the\r\n  labourers in the good cottages to attend their wives during their\r\n  confinement, and generally receive my guinea before I leave the house,\r\n  whilst the labourer less favourably situated invariably applies to his\r\n  parish for medical relief under such circumstances. I think there\r\n  cannot be a doubt if the whole of the wretched hovels were converted\r\n  into good cottages, with a strict attention to warmth, ventilation,\r\n  and drainage, and a receptacle for filth of every kind placed at a\r\n  proper distance, it would not only improve the health of the poor by\r\n  removing a most prolific source of disease, and thereby most sensibly\r\n  diminish the rates, but I am convinced it would also tend most\r\n  materially to raise the moral character of the poor man, and render\r\n  him less susceptible to the allurements of the idle and wicked.”\r\n\r\nThe tenor of much information respecting the condition of many of the\r\nlabouring classes in Somerset, where the deaths from the four classes of\r\ndisease were still higher than in the two other counties, and amounted\r\nduring the one year to 5417, is exhibited in the sanitary report of _Mr.\r\nJames Gane_, the medical officer of the Axbridge union, who states\r\nthat,—\r\n\r\n  “The situation of this district where the diseases herein mentioned\r\n  prevail, is a perfect flat called the South Marsh, in the main road\r\n  between Bristol and Bridgewater. There are numerous dykes or ditches\r\n  for the purpose of drainage. The cottages of the poor are mostly of a\r\n  bad description, frequently mud wall, and often situated close to the\r\n  dykes, where the water for the most part is in a state of stagnation.\r\n  Oftentimes not more than one room for the whole family; sometimes two;\r\n  one above the other; with the really poor, the latter is seldom to be\r\n  met with, (unless it should happen now and then in a parish where a\r\n  poor-house was built a short time before the formation of the Union).\r\n  A pigsty where the inmates are capable of keeping a pig is frequently\r\n  attached to the dwelling, and in the heat of summer produces a stench\r\n  quite intolerable; the want of space however prevents it being\r\n  otherwise. The regular poor-house (those mentioned above being\r\n  detached cottages) in most of the parishes in this district are of a\r\n  much worse description, several large families existing under the same\r\n  roof, occupying only one room each family, and having but one entrance\r\n  door to the dwelling; here filth and poverty go hand-in-hand without\r\n  any restriction and under no control. The accumulation of filth being\r\n  attributable to the want of proper receptacles for refuse, and the\r\n  indolent and filthy disposition of the inhabitants, in no instance\r\n  _have_ such places been provided. The floors are seldom or never\r\n  scrubbed; and the parish authorities pay so little attention to these\r\n  houses, that the walls never get white-limed from one end of the year\r\n  to the other. The windows are kept air-tight by the stuffing of some\r\n  old garments, and every article for use is kept in the same room. The\r\n  necessary is close to the building, where all have access, and\r\n  producing a most intolerable nuisance. In a locality naturally\r\n  engendering malaria, the diseases with which the poor are for the most\r\n  part afflicted are, fevers such as are stated in this report and which\r\n  sometimes run into a low typhoid state. The neighbourhood in general\r\n  is considered in as good a state of drainage as it will admit of. The\r\n  occurrence of disease among the poor population is for the most part\r\n  at spring and autumn, at those times agues and fevers prevail.\r\n  Small-pox and scarlet fever are met with at all seasons of the year,\r\n  but prevail as epidemics, the former in spring and summer, and the\r\n  latter about autumn or the beginning of winter. I attribute the\r\n  prevalence of diseases of an epidemic character, which exists so much\r\n  more among the poor than among the rich, to be, from the want of\r\n  better accommodation as residence, (their dwelling instead of being\r\n  built of solid materials are complete shells of mud on a spot of waste\r\n  land the most swampy in the parish, this is to be met with almost\r\n  everywhere in rural districts,) to the want of better clothing, being\r\n  better fed, more attention paid to the cleanliness of their dwellings,\r\n  and less congregated together. The health of persons even where a\r\n  large family is, and where superior cottage accommodation is afforded\r\n  to them, is much better generally than others less advantageously\r\n  situated. The influence over their habits will also be very\r\n  beneficial, they will be less likely to run to a beer-house with their\r\n  last penny, the comforts of a home after the toils of the day keeps\r\n  them by their own fireside; they become better contented, less liable\r\n  to disease, make better husbands, better fathers, better neighbours,\r\n  and with each other better friends. There is a subject which I wish\r\n  particularly to press on the attention of the Commissioners; the\r\n  presence throughout the country, and to be found in every parish, of\r\n  low lodging-houses, where persons of the lowest grade of society,\r\n  beggars, thieves, and such like, take up a temporary abode in passing\r\n  from one part of the kingdom to another, bringing with them the seeds\r\n  of infectious diseases and oftentimes the actual disease itself into a\r\n  neighbourhood previously in a comparative state of health. I have\r\n  observed, where persons are living in a locality habitually affected\r\n  with malaria, that when becoming convalescent from any other disease,\r\n  are often attacked with ague, more particularly among the poorer\r\n  classes.\r\n\r\n  “There is a class of persons called the ‘second poor,’ who for the\r\n  most part are constantly employed throughout the year as farmers’\r\n  labourers, and who are in much better circumstances than those to whom\r\n  I have above alluded; they have much better cottage accommodation,\r\n  their houses being provided with one, sometimes two day-rooms, two\r\n  bed-rooms, a pantry, and other conveniences for fuel and for refuse,\r\n  and whose general health and condition is much better than those less\r\n  advantageously situated. Therefore detached cottages for the poor,\r\n  with a moderate sized day-room, two or three bed-rooms, a pantry,\r\n  receptacles for refuse and for fuel, with casement windows or some\r\n  such contrivance for ventilation, will be a blessing to them, and very\r\n  available sanitary regulations. I know of no better method than is to\r\n  be seen in all cottages for the economical management of fuel, both in\r\n  cooking and maintaining a proper temperature of the rooms.”\r\n\r\nThe following extract from the report of _Mr. Aaron Little_, the medical\r\nofficer of the Chippenham union, affords a specimen of the frequent\r\ncondition of rural villages which have apparently the most advantageous\r\nsites:—\r\n\r\n  “The parish of Colerne, which, upon a cursory view, any person\r\n  (unacquainted with its peculiarities) would pronounce to be the most\r\n  healthy village in England, is in fact the most unhealthy. From its\r\n  commanding position (being situated upon a high hill) it has an\r\n  appearance of health and cheerfulness which delight the eye of the\r\n  traveller, who commands a view of it from the Great Western road, but\r\n  this impression is immediately removed on entering at any point of the\r\n  town. The filth, the dilapidated buildings, the squalid appearance of\r\n  the majority of the lower orders, have a sickening effect upon the\r\n  stranger who first visits this place. During three years’ attendance\r\n  on the poor of this district, I have never known the small-pox,\r\n  scarlatina, or the typhus fever to be absent. The situation is damp,\r\n  and the buildings unhealthy, and the inhabitants themselves inclined\r\n  to be of dirty habits. There is also a great want of drainage.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. William Blower_, the surgeon of the Bedford union, to whose\r\nevidence on the influence of moral causes on the health of the\r\npopulation, we shall again have occasion to refer, states:—\r\n\r\n  “Throughout the whole of this district, there is a great want of\r\n  ‘superior cottage accommodation.’ Most of the residences of the\r\n  labourers are thickly inhabited, and many of them are damp, low, cold,\r\n  smoky, and comfortless. These circumstances occasion the inmates to be\r\n  sickly in the winter season, but I have not observed them to generate\r\n  typhus, the prevailing form of disease being principally catarrhal;\r\n  such as colds, coughs, inflammations of the eyes, dysentery,\r\n  rheumatism, &c. However, when any contagious or epidemic malaria\r\n  occurs, the cases are generally more numerous.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Weale_ reports instances of the condition of large proportions of\r\nthe agricultural population in the counties of Bedford, Northampton, and\r\nWarwick. The medical officer of the Woburn union states, in respect to\r\nToddington, that—\r\n\r\n  “In this town fever prevailed during the last year, and, from the\r\n  state of the dwellings of the persons I called on, this could not be\r\n  wondered at. Very few of the cottages were furnished with privies that\r\n  could be used, and contiguous to almost every door a dung heap was\r\n  raised on which every species of filth was accumulated, either for the\r\n  purpose of being used in the garden allotments of the cottagers, or to\r\n  be disposed of for manure. Scarcely any cottage was provided with a\r\n  pantry, and I found the provisions generally kept in the bed-rooms. In\r\n  several instances I found whole families, comprising adult and infant\r\n  children with their parents, sleeping in one room.”\r\n\r\nThe medical officer of the Ampthill union states:—\r\n\r\n  “Typhus fever has existed for the last three or four months in the\r\n  parish of Flitwick, and although the number of deaths has not been\r\n  considerable as compared with the progress of the disease, new cases\r\n  have occurred as those under treatment became convalescent, and\r\n  several are still suffering under this malady. The cottages in which\r\n  it first appeared (and to which it has been almost exclusively\r\n  confined), are of the most wretched description: a stagnant pond is in\r\n  the immediate vicinity, and none of the tenements have drains; rubbish\r\n  is thrown within a few yards of the dwellings, and there is no doubt\r\n  but in damp foggy weather, and also during the heat of summer, the\r\n  exhalations arising from those heaps of filth must generate disease,\r\n  and the obnoxious effluvia tends to spread contagion where it already\r\n  exists. It appears that most of the cottages alluded to were erected\r\n  for election purposes, and have since been allowed to decay; the roofs\r\n  are repaired with turf dug in the neighbourhood, and the walls\r\n  repaired with prepared clay, without the addition of lime-washing.\r\n  Contagious disease has not been remarkable within the Union in any\r\n  other spot than the one alluded to.”\r\n\r\n_Messrs. Smith_ and _Moore_, the medical officers of the Bishop\r\nStortford union, state,—\r\n\r\n  “We have always found the smallest and most slightly-built houses the\r\n  seats of the lowest forms of disease; and although, during the last\r\n  year, no epidemic or infectious disease here prevailed, it is but just\r\n  to state that, generally speaking, the cottages of labourers in this\r\n  district are small, badly protected from both extremes of weather,\r\n  badly drained, and low in the ground.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. J. S. Nott_, the medical officer of the Witham union, states,—\r\n\r\n  “As medical officer of my district, I am glad to have an opportunity\r\n  of recording my opinion of many of the causes of fever that uniformly\r\n  prevails in the autumn and spring in this neighbourhood. I must first\r\n  state that the situation of the town is exceedingly low, with two\r\n  small rivers passing through it, and numerous open sewers intersecting\r\n  the town and its environs, the effluvia of which is frequently\r\n  exceedingly offensive, and at all times prejudicial to the general\r\n  health, and calculated to create, by its malaria, the various kinds of\r\n  fevers, (typhus and remittent). Part of the town is subject to floods;\r\n  added to which, the cottages are small and crowded together. A great\r\n  number of the inhabitants accumulate filth and manure for the purpose\r\n  of sale. There are also many open slaughter-houses, where the refuse\r\n  and filth is allowed to accumulate for weeks together without removal;\r\n  and innumerable pigs are kept and fattened on the back of the premises\r\n  of a great number of the inhabitants; and altogether it would be\r\n  difficult to find any town of its size where so little regard is paid\r\n  to cleanliness and ventilation; but where we do find the exception,\r\n  roomy and well-ventilated cottages, (and they are but few,) the cases\r\n  of fever are more manageable, and recover sooner.”\r\n\r\nThe state of Windsor affords an example that the highest neighbourhoods\r\nin power and wealth do not at present possess securities for the\r\nprevention of nuisances dangerous to the public health. _Mr. Parker_, in\r\nhis report on the condition of his district, states—\r\n\r\n  “With regard to the drainage of the towns in the counties of\r\n  Buckingham, Oxford, and Berks, it may be observed that there is no\r\n  town in which great improvements might not be effected. In Reading\r\n  there are commissioners appointed under a local Act to make provision\r\n  for cleansing the town and removing nuisances; but their duties do not\r\n  appear to be performed with due regard to the importance of the trust,\r\n  for the Board of Guardians of the Reading union, by resolutions\r\n  entered in their minutes, frequently point out nuisances, and remind\r\n  the commissioners of the filthy condition of many of the courts and\r\n  back streets. But extensive as the improvements in the state of the\r\n  drainage of almost every town in these counties might be, there is no\r\n  town amongst them in which there is so wide a field for improvement as\r\n  Windsor, which, from the contiguity of the palace, the wealth of the\r\n  inhabitants, and the situation, might have been expected to be\r\n  superior in this respect to any other provincial town. Such, however,\r\n  is not the case; for of all the towns visited by me, Windsor is the\r\n  worst beyond all comparison. From the gas-works at the end of\r\n  George-street a double line of open, deep, black, and stagnant ditches\r\n  extends to Clewer-lane. From these ditches an intolerable stench is\r\n  perpetually rising, and produces fever of a severe character. I\r\n  visited a cottage in Clewer-lane in which typhus fever had existed for\r\n  some time, and learnt from a woman who had recently lost a child the\r\n  complaint was attributable to the state of these ditches. Mr. Bailey,\r\n  the relieving officer, informs me that cases of typhus fever are\r\n  frequent in the neighbourhood; and observes that there are now seven\r\n  or eight persons attacked by typhus in Charles-street and South-place.\r\n  He considers the neighbourhood of Garden-court in almost the same\r\n  condition. ‘There is a drain,’ he says, ‘running from the barracks\r\n  into the Thames across the Long Walk. That drain is almost as\r\n  offensive as the black ditches extending to Clewer-lane. The openings\r\n  to the sewers in Windsor are exceedingly offensive in hot weather. The\r\n  town is not well supplied with water, and the drainage is very\r\n  defective.’ The ditches of which I have spoken are sometimes emptied\r\n  by carts; and on the last occasion their contents were purchased for\r\n  the sum of 15_l._. by the occupier of land in the parish of Clewer,\r\n  whose meadows suffered from the extraordinary strength of the manure,\r\n  which was used without previous preparation.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Harding_, medical officer of the Epping union, states,—\r\n\r\n  “The state of some of the dwellings of the poor is most deplorable as\r\n  it regards their health, and also in a moral point of view. As it\r\n  relates to the former, many of their cottages are neither wind nor\r\n  water tight. It has often fallen to my lot to be called on to attend a\r\n  labour where the wet has been running down the walls, and light to be\r\n  distinguished through the roof, and this in the winter season, with no\r\n  fire-place in the room. As it relates to the latter, in my opinion a\r\n  great want of accommodation for bed-rooms often occurs, so that you\r\n  may frequently find the father, mother, and children all sleeping in\r\n  the same apartment, and in some instances the children having attained\r\n  the age of 16 or 17 years, and of both sexes; and if a death occurs in\r\n  the house, let the person die of the most contagious disease, they\r\n  must either sleep in the same room, or take their repose in the room\r\n  they live in, which most frequently is a stone or brick floor, which\r\n  must be detrimental to health.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. J. D. Browne_, medical officer of the West Ham union states that,—\r\n\r\n  “The cases of typhus (21 cases in the parish of Walthamstow) have\r\n  occurred periodically in certain localities, arising partly from want\r\n  of personal cleanliness, and also from being situated near ditches\r\n  into which putrefactive matter was deposited, such as the privies and\r\n  pigsties emptying themselves. The medical officer called the attention\r\n  of the Board of Guardians, vicar, and parochial officers to the\r\n  subject; and though it was unanimously admitted that the evil was\r\n  great, and an anxious desire was expressed in vestry to remove the\r\n  existing evil, yet the case fell to the ground, there being no funds\r\n  to meet the exigency. The medical officer feels persuaded that a power\r\n  should be invested in the Board of Guardians or parochial officers to\r\n  meet such cases.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Thomas H. Smith_, the medical officer of the Bromley union,\r\nstates,—\r\n\r\n  “My attention was first directed to the sources of malaria in this\r\n  district and neighbourhood when cholera became epidemic. I then\r\n  partially inspected the dwellings of the poor, and have recently\r\n  completed the survey. It is almost incredible that so many sources of\r\n  malaria should exist in a rural district. A total absence of all\r\n  provision for effectual drainage around cottages is the most prominent\r\n  source of malaria; throughout the whole district there is scarcely an\r\n  attempt at it. The refuse, vegetable and animal matters, are also\r\n  thrown by the cottagers in heaps near their dwellings to decompose;\r\n  are sometimes not removed, except at very long intervals; and are\r\n  always permitted to remain sufficiently long to accumulate in some\r\n  quantity. Pigsties are generally near the dwellings, and are always\r\n  surrounded by decomposing matters. These constitute some of the many\r\n  sources of malaria, and peculiarly deserve attention as being easily\r\n  remedied, and yet, as it were, cherished. The effects of malaria are\r\n  strikingly exemplified in parts of this district. There are localities\r\n  from which fever is seldom long absent; and I find spots where the\r\n  spasmodic cholera located itself are also the chosen resorts of\r\n  continued fever.”\r\n\r\nPassing the metropolis and the adjacent districts, I proceed to the\r\nevidence as to the condition of the dwellings of the poorest classes in\r\nthe midland counties.\r\n\r\nThe report from Mr. Hodgson and the physicians of the town of Birmingham\r\nwill be considered a valuable public document, as exhibiting the effect\r\nof drainage produced by a peculiarly fortunate situation. The houses, of\r\nwhich I requested drawings, are on the whole built upon an improved\r\nplan. This town, it will be seen, is distinguished apparently by an\r\nimmunity from fever, and the general health of the population is high,\r\nalthough the occupations are such as are elsewhere deemed prejudicial to\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from _Mr. Hodgkins_, the medical officer of\r\nBilston, in the Wolverhampton Union, describes the condition of the\r\npopulation of a colliery district:—\r\n\r\n  “Bilston, like Wolverhampton, has not been visited by fever to any\r\n  extent since the cholera in 1832. The awful destruction which then\r\n  occurred swept off many of those subjects who might afterwards have\r\n  been victims of fever; in fact Bilston was, after the cessation of\r\n  cholera, nearly free from disease of any kind for several months.\r\n  Influenza has occasionally visited us and swept off a few. Small-pox a\r\n  few years ago was prevalent, but not very fatal, although many\r\n  children from negligence on the part of the parents are not\r\n  vaccinated. Scarlet fever has appeared sometimes, but only in\r\n  straggling cases. The occupations of the poorer classes are chiefly\r\n  colliers, labourers, &c., great members of the latter being Irish. The\r\n  houses of those applying for parochial medical relief which I have\r\n  visited have been dirty and crowded, the habits of the working classes\r\n  here being generally improvident and dirty, many parties forming heaps\r\n  of filth close to their doors; and here, as in Wolverhampton, I am\r\n  afraid it would require the interference of the law to effect any\r\n  permanent good. Some years ago a large culvert was carried down the\r\n  principal street which has made a great improvement in that part, but\r\n  much yet remains undrained. I would mention a place in High-street\r\n  especially, near to a court, crowded with Irish, there is a pool of\r\n  green stagnant water or mud continually; another place called the\r\n  Berry, behind the King’s Arms Inn, and a third in a court in\r\n  Temple-street, where there appears to be a drain which has been choked\r\n  up, the stench from which is intolerable.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. Edward Knight_ gives the following description of the sanitary\r\ncondition of the town of Stafford:—\r\n\r\n  “During the year ending September 29th, 1839, there have been in the\r\n  fever-wards connected with the Stafford County General Infirmary 76\r\n  cases of fever, of which number 10 have died, and the remaining 66\r\n  were discharged cured. The far greater part of these cases commenced\r\n  in the town of Stafford, some being brought to the infirmary in a\r\n  dying state, which gives a greater rate of mortality. Although the\r\n  fever-wards are well arranged, and every comfort and attention\r\n  provided for the patients, there is a general dislike on the part of\r\n  the poor to be removed to them from their own houses, except in cases\r\n  of actual necessity.\r\n\r\n  “Owing to this, and the filthy state of those parts of the town\r\n  occupied exclusively by the lower classes, as the ‘Broad-eye,’\r\n  ‘Back-walls,’ &c., we have generally more or less of infectious\r\n  diseases during the autumn and winter months in each year, and\r\n  although such diseases do not extend their ravages to the more\r\n  respectable inhabitants, the above form but a very small portion of\r\n  the cases which occur.\r\n\r\n  “These parts of the town are without drainage, the houses, which are\r\n  private property, are built without any regard to situation or\r\n  ventilation, and constructed in a manner to ensure the greatest return\r\n  at the least possible outlay. The accommodation in them does not\r\n  extend beyond two rooms; these are small, and, for the most part, the\r\n  families work in the day-time in the same room in which they sleep, to\r\n  save fuel.\r\n\r\n  “There is not any provision made for refuse dirt, which, as the least\r\n  trouble, is thrown down in front of the houses, and there left to\r\n  putrefy. The back entrances to the houses in the principal streets are\r\n  generally into these, the stabling and cow-houses, &c., belonging to\r\n  them, forming one side of the street, and the manure, refuse vegetable\r\n  matter, &c., carried into the street, and placed opposite to the\r\n  poorer houses; so that they are continually subjected to the malaria\r\n  arising from that, in addition to their own dirt.\r\n\r\n  “The sedentary occupation of the working classes (shoemaking being the\r\n  staple trade of the town), their own want of cleanliness and general\r\n  intemperance, form, also, a fruitful source of disease. One-half of\r\n  the week is usually spent in the public-houses, and the other half\r\n  they work night and day to procure the necessary subsistence for their\r\n  families. There is a great want of improvement in the moral character\r\n  of the poor; they can obtain sufficient wages to support their\r\n  families respectably, but they are improvident and never make any\r\n  provision against illness. A local Act for the improvement of the town\r\n  empowers the commissioners to remove nuisances; but no notice is ever\r\n  taken. The situation of Stafford also offers every facility for an\r\n  efficient drainage; it is nearly surrounded by a large ditch, in which\r\n  there might be a running stream of water, well calculated to remove\r\n  all impurities; but it is always choked up, and in a stagnant state.\r\n  The river ‘Sow’ is also close to the town. There are not any sewers\r\n  even in the principal streets, the water being carried off by open\r\n  channels. In the Lunatic Asylum, which closely adjoins the town, and\r\n  averages 250 patients, great attention is paid to cleanliness, and we\r\n  never have any infectious diseases.”\r\n\r\nIn the month of December, 1839, an application was made to the Board for\r\nadvice and aid to meet the emergencies created by an epidemic which had\r\nbroken out in the parish of Breadsall in the Shardlow union\r\n(Derbyshire). Mr. Senior, the Assistant Commissioner for the district,\r\naccompanied Dr. Kennedy to the spot where the fever was prevalent, and\r\nthat report[2] may be submitted to attention, as containing a picture of\r\nthe habits of a large proportion of the population of that part of the\r\ncountry, and an exemplification in a group of individual cases of the\r\ncommon causes and effects of such calamities on the labouring\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThe report from Dr. Baker, of Derby, and Mr. Senior’s report, comprising\r\nthe returns from the medical officers of Nottingham, Lincoln, and other\r\nrural and town unions within his district, pourtray the sanitary\r\ncondition of a large proportion of the population included in them.\r\n\r\nProceeding northward, a report from _Mr. Bland_, the medical officer of\r\nthe Macclesfield union, gives the following description of the state of\r\nthe residences occupied by many of the labourers of that town:—\r\n\r\n  “In a part of the town called the Orchard, Watercoates, there are 34\r\n  houses without back doors, or other complete means of ventilation; the\r\n  houses are chiefly small, damp, and dark; they are rendered worse with\r\n  respect to dampness perhaps than they would be from the habit of the\r\n  people closing their windows to keep them warm. To these houses are\r\n  three privies uncovered; here little pools of water, with all kinds of\r\n  offal, dead animal and vegetable matter are heaped together, a most\r\n  foul and putrid mass, disgusting to the sight, and offensive to the\r\n  smell; the fumes of contagion spreads periodically itself in the\r\n  neighbourhood, and produces different types of fever and disorder of\r\n  the stomach and bowels. The people inhabiting these abodes are pale\r\n  and unhealthy, and in one house in particular are pale, bloated, and\r\n  rickety.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. William Rayner_, the medical officer of the Heaton Norris district\r\nof the Stockport union describes the condition of a part of the\r\npopulation of that place:—\r\n\r\n  “The localities in which fever mostly prevails in my district, are\r\n  Shepherd’s Buildings and Back Water Street, both in the township of\r\n  Heaton Norris. Shepherd’s Buildings consist of two rows of houses with\r\n  a street seven yards wide between them; each row consists of what are\r\n  styled back and front houses—that is two houses placed back to back.\r\n  There are no yards or out-conveniences; the privies are in the centre\r\n  of each row, about a yard wide; over them there is part of a\r\n  sleeping-room; there is no ventilation in the bed-rooms; each house\r\n  contains two rooms, viz., a house place and sleeping room above; each\r\n  room is about three yards wide and four long. In one of these houses\r\n  there are nine persons belonging to one family, and the mother on the\r\n  eve of her confinement. There are 44 houses in the two rows, and 22\r\n  cellars, all of the same size. The cellars are let off as separate\r\n  dwellings; these are dark, damp, and very low, not more than six feet\r\n  between the ceiling and floor. The street between the two rows is\r\n  seven yards wide, in the centre of which is the common gutter, or more\r\n  properly sink, into which all sorts of refuse is thrown; it is a foot\r\n  in depth. Thus there is always a quantity of putrefying matter\r\n  contaminating the air. At the end of the rows is a pool of water very\r\n  shallow and stagnant, and a few yards further, a part of the town’s\r\n  gas works. In many of these dwellings there are four persons in one\r\n  bed.\r\n\r\n  “Backwater-street, the other locality of fever, is proverbially the\r\n  most filthy street in the town, contains a number of lodging-houses\r\n  and Irish, who mostly live in dark damp cellars, in which the light\r\n  can scarcely penetrate.\r\n\r\n  “It is not to be wondered at that such places should be the constant\r\n  foci of fevers; there is scarcely a house in Shepherd’s-buildings that\r\n  has not been affected with fever, and in some instances repeatedly:\r\n  new residents are most liable to be affected, the force of habit, or\r\n  some other protecting influence seems to render those who have lived\r\n  there some time less liable to be attacked. The same circumstance has\r\n  been noticed by others, and M. Louis, who is known throughout Europe,\r\n  having made this subject one of particular observation, states that it\r\n  is generally within the first year that new comers take fever, whilst\r\n  the old inhabitants who are equally exposed to the same exciting\r\n  causes escape.”\r\n\r\nThe report of Dr. Baron Howard, on the condition of the population of\r\nManchester, and that of Dr. Duncan, on the condition of the population\r\nof Liverpool, will make up a progressive view of the condition of the\r\nlabouring population in those parts of the country. The Report of one of\r\nthe medical officers of the West Derby union, with relation to the\r\ncondition of the labouring population connected with Liverpool, will\r\nserve to show that the evils in question are not confined to the\r\nlabouring population of the town properly so called.\r\n\r\n  “The locality of the residences of the labouring classes are in\r\n  respect to the surrounding atmosphere favourably situated, but their\r\n  internal structure and economy the very reverse of favourable. The\r\n  cottages are in general built more with a view to the per centage of\r\n  the landlord than to the accommodation of the poor. The joiner’s work\r\n  is ill performed; admitting by the doors, windows, and even floors,\r\n  air in abundance, which, however, in many cases, is not\r\n  disadvantageous to the inmates. The houses generally consist of three\r\n  apartments, viz., the day-room, into which the street-door opens, and\r\n  two bed-rooms, one above the other. There is likewise beneath the\r\n  day-room a cellar, let off either by the landlord or tenant of the\r\n  house, to a more improvident class of labourers; which cellar, in\r\n  almost all cases, is small and damp, and often crowded with\r\n  inhabitants to excess. These cellars are, in my opinion, the source of\r\n  many diseases, particularly catarrh, rheumatic affections, and tedious\r\n  cases of typhus mitior, which, owing to the overcrowded state of the\r\n  apartment, occasionally pass into typhus gravior. I need scarcely add\r\n  that the furniture and bedding are in keeping with the miserable\r\n  inmates. The rooms above the day-room are often let separately by the\r\n  tenant to lodgers, varying in number from one or two, to six or eight\r\n  individuals in each, their slovenly habits, indolence, and consequent\r\n  accumulation of filth go far to promote the prevalence of contagious\r\n  and infectious diseases.\r\n\r\n  “The houses already alluded to front the street, but there are houses\r\n  in back courts still more unfavourably placed, which also have their\r\n  cellars, and their tenants of a description worse, if possible. There\r\n  is commonly only one receptacle for refuse in a court of eight, ten,\r\n  or twelve densely crowded houses. In the year 1836–7, I attended a\r\n  family of 13, twelve of whom had typhus fever, without a bed in the\r\n  _cellar_, without straw or timber shavings—frequent substitutes. They\r\n  lay on the floor, and so crowded, that I could scarcely pass between\r\n  them. In another house I attended 14 patients; there were only two\r\n  beds in the house. All the patients, as lodgers, lay on the boards,\r\n  and during their illness, never had their clothes off. I met with many\r\n  cases in similar conditions, yet amidst the greatest destitution and\r\n  want of domestic comfort, I have never heard during the course of\r\n  twelve years’ practice, a complaint of inconvenient accommodation.”\r\n\r\nThe following extract from the report of _Mr. Pearson_, medical officer\r\nof the Wigan union, is descriptive of the condition of large classes of\r\ntenements in the manufacturing towns of Lancashire:—\r\n\r\n  “From the few observations which I have been enabled to make\r\n  respecting the causes of fever during the two months which I have held\r\n  the situation of house surgeon to the Dispensary, I am inclined to\r\n  consider the filthy condition of the town as being the most prominent\r\n  source. Many of the streets are unpaved and almost covered with\r\n  stagnant water, which lodges in numerous large holes which exist upon\r\n  their surface, and into which the inhabitants throw all kinds of\r\n  rejected animal and vegetable matters, which then undergo decay and\r\n  emit the most poisonous exhalations. These matters are often allowed,\r\n  from the filthy habits of the inhabitants of these districts, many of\r\n  whom, especially the poor Irish, are utterly regardless both of\r\n  personal and domestic cleanliness, to accumulate to an immense extent,\r\n  and thus become prolific sources of malaria, rendering the atmosphere\r\n  an active poison. The streets which particularly exhibit this\r\n  condition are Ashton-street, Hanover-street, Stuart-street,\r\n  John-street, Lord-street, Duke-street, Princess-street, and the short\r\n  streets leading from Queen-street, into Faggy-lane and\r\n  Princess-street. It may be also mentioned, that in many of these\r\n  streets there are no privies, or, if there are, they are in so filthy\r\n  a condition as to be absolutely useless; the absence of these must,\r\n  necessarily, increase the quantity of filth, and thus materially add\r\n  to the extent of the nuisance.\r\n\r\n  “In addition to the streets above mentioned, there are, besides, two\r\n  other localities, which must be considered as peculiarly fitted for\r\n  the generation of malaria—I mean the waste land in front of Bradshaw\r\n  Gate, and also that situated between Greenough’s-row and\r\n  Kerfoot’s-row; the latter is one complete pool of stagnant water,\r\n  mixed with various descriptions of putrifying animal and vegetable\r\n  matters. Many of the yards and courts in various parts of the town are\r\n  so built up as to prevent the movements of the atmosphere, and are in\r\n  a horribly filthy state, in consequence of dunghills which are\r\n  situated therein being allowed to grow to an immense size, and the\r\n  water which drains therefrom being permitted to flow over the\r\n  surface.”\r\n\r\nProceeding northwards, little difference is observable in the condition\r\nof the working classes in the ancient towns, where the habitations were\r\ncrowded for the sake of fortification, and in the manufacturing towns,\r\nwhere the habitations are crowded for the sake of vicinity to the places\r\nof work, or from ignorance and inattention, or from the high price of\r\nland. We cite the following instances of the condition of the\r\nhabitations and population in Durham, Barnard Castle, and Carlisle:—\r\n\r\n_Mr. Nicholas Oliver_, Durham, states that—\r\n\r\n  “The city of Durham, like all ancient cities and towns, is built very\r\n  irregularly, and surrounded on all sides by the river Wear, which is\r\n  frequently overflown, and much wooded. These in summer and autumn, by\r\n  the combined influences of heat, moisture, and decaying vegetable\r\n  substances, become abundant sources of malaria. The streets are very\r\n  narrow, and the houses are built so much behind each other that the\r\n  entrance to a great many of the dwellings is by a passage, lane, or\r\n  alley, either a steep ascent or descent, where, from a proper want of\r\n  receptacles and sewers, filth is allowed to accumulate, and there\r\n  necessarily is a constant emanation of fœtid effluvia. The majority of\r\n  the houses are very old and in a dilapidated state, several not being\r\n  weather proof. The great bulk of the working classes inhabit these\r\n  tenements, and they seldom occupy more than two rooms, many only one,\r\n  where all that is requisite in conducing to cleanliness and comfort\r\n  has to be performed.\r\n\r\n  “The spirit of improvement, which is making such rapid strides in\r\n  other parts of the country, is here quite dormant. Nothing calls\r\n  louder for the attention of the constituted authorities than the\r\n  improvements which might be effected in the habitations of the\r\n  industrious classes, thereby increasing their health, comfort, and\r\n  happiness.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. George Brown_, of Barnard Castle, in the Teesdale union, states\r\nthat—\r\n\r\n  “The residences of the labouring population within the Teesdale Union,\r\n  especially in Barnard Castle and the more populous villages, is mostly\r\n  in large houses let into tenements. At least four-fifths of the\r\n  weavers in Barnard Castle live in such residences, and about one half\r\n  of all the other labouring poor in the Union. The tenements which form\r\n  the residences of the weavers and other labourers in Barnard Castle\r\n  are principally situate in Thorngage, Bridgegate, and the lower parts\r\n  of the town, and in confined yards and alleys. The houses are many of\r\n  them very large. I am told somewhere there are as many as 50 or more\r\n  individuals under one roof. There is generally, perhaps, one privy to\r\n  a whole yard (or onset as they term it), embracing five or six houses.\r\n  From the crowded state of these dwelling-houses, and the filthiness of\r\n  many of their inmates, disease would undoubtedly arise more commonly\r\n  than it actually does, but the river Tees flows at the foot of each\r\n  yard, running alongside of all the houses in Bridgegate. The\r\n  impurities are thus speedily carried away, and the evils which might\r\n  otherwise be expected from the effluvia of vegetable and other bodies\r\n  in a state of decomposition are prevented; besides which, the houses\r\n  in general being large and the poorer class in the upper stories, they\r\n  are more protected against cold and damp.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Brown_, in regard to Barnard Castle, further states, that—\r\n\r\n  “A surgeon here of great intelligence and practice states that in the\r\n  town of Barnard Castle he has always found the most obstinate cases of\r\n  typhus and other epidemics, and also rheumatism, to prevail amongst\r\n  the houses on the west side of the principal street. These houses\r\n  slope towards the moat of the old castle, which is not sufficiently\r\n  drained; and the thick and high walls of the ruins of the castle\r\n  retain the damp, and prevent the accession of the western winds to the\r\n  moat and many of the houses. In the interior of the castle, now used\r\n  as a garden, there is a stagnant pond which ought to be drained off:\r\n  this pond is nearly opposite the yards, which are full of the\r\n  residences of the poorer classes, and called the Swamp. Disease is\r\n  often found to exist in these yards, and the surgeon I have referred\r\n  to attributes to it the dampness of the moat (upon or on the margin of\r\n  which the houses are built) and to the pond before mentioned. All the\r\n  houses on the west side of the street have one step, and some more,\r\n  down from the street. I am also told by the same surgeon that very\r\n  many of the cases of fever and rheumatism which he attends may be\r\n  fairly traced to the dampness of houses or want of sufficient drainage\r\n  of the ground previously to building, and their being built below the\r\n  level of the adjoining ground, by which the moisture is thrown into\r\n  them.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Rowland_, of Carlisle, states—\r\n\r\n  “Though Carlisle abounds with beautiful walks, it generally has them\r\n  accompanied with filthy putrid gutters, and there seems no mode of\r\n  compelling any one to clean them out. The city is surrounded with such\r\n  nuisances; on the south side at the foot of Botchergate, there is a\r\n  gutter, perhaps a mile long, which conducts the filth of that quarter\r\n  through the fields into the river Petteril. The stench in summer is\r\n  very great. The filth seems to accumulate from want of descent, and\r\n  probably the whole descent is in the first field next Botchergate. If\r\n  this gutter was paved and the descent made regular, I have no doubt it\r\n  would keep itself clean.”\r\n\r\nThe following is a brief notice of the condition of the residences of\r\nthe population amidst which the cholera first made its appearance in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Robert Atkinson_, Gateshead, states, that—\r\n\r\n  “It is impossible to give a proper representation of the wretched\r\n  state of many of the inhabitants of the indigent class, situated in\r\n  the confined streets called Pipewellgate and Killgate, which are kept\r\n  in a most filthy state, and to a stranger would appear inimical to the\r\n  existence of human beings, where each small, ill ventilated apartment\r\n  of the house contained a family with lodgers in number from seven to\r\n  nine, and seldom more than two beds for the whole. The want of\r\n  convenient offices in the neighbourhood is attended with many very\r\n  unpleasant circumstances, as it induces the lazy inmates to make use\r\n  of chamber utensils, which are suffered to remain in the most\r\n  offensive state for several days, and are then emptied out of the\r\n  windows. The writer had occasion a short time ago to visit a person\r\n  ill of the cholera; his lodgings were in a room of a miserable house\r\n  situated in the very filthiest part of Pipewellgate, divided into six\r\n  apartments, and occupied by different families to the number of 26\r\n  persons in all. The room contained three wretched beds with two\r\n  persons sleeping in each: it measured about 12 feet in length and 7 in\r\n  breadth, and its greatest height would not admit of a person’s\r\n  standing erect; it received light from a small window, the sash of\r\n  which was fixed. Two of the number lay ill of the cholera, and the\r\n  rest appeared afraid of the admission of pure air, having carefully\r\n  closed up the broken panes with plugs of old linen.”\r\n\r\nThe _Rev. Dr. Gilly_, the vicar of Norham and canon of Durham, in an\r\nappeal in behalf of the border peasantry, describes their dwellings as\r\n“built of rubble or unhewn stone, loosely cemented; and from age, or\r\nfrom badness of the materials, the walls look as if they would scarcely\r\nhold together.” The chinks gape in so many places as admit blasts of\r\nwind:—\r\n\r\n  “The chimneys have lost half their original height, and lean on the\r\n  roof with fearful gravitation. The rafters are evidently rotten and\r\n  displaced; and the thatch, yawning to admit the wind and wet in some\r\n  parts, and in all parts utterly unfit for its original purpose of\r\n  giving protection from the weather, looks more like the top of a\r\n  dunghill than of a cottage.\r\n\r\n  “Such is the exterior; and when the hind comes to take possession, he\r\n  finds it no better than a shed. The wet, if it happens to rain, is\r\n  making a puddle on the earth floor. (This earth floor, by the bye, is\r\n  one of the causes to which Erasmus ascribed the frequent recurrence of\r\n  epidemic sickness among the cotters of England more than 300 years\r\n  ago. It is not only cold and wet, but contains the aggregate filth of\r\n  years, from the time of its first being used. The refuse and dropping\r\n  of meals, decayed animal and vegetable matter of all kinds, which has\r\n  been cast upon it from the mouth and stomach, these all mix together\r\n  and exude from it.) Window-frame there is none. There is neither oven,\r\n  nor copper, nor grate, nor shelf, nor fixture of any kind; all these\r\n  things he has to bring with him, besides his ordinary articles of\r\n  furniture. Imagine the trouble, the inconvenience, and the expense\r\n  which the poor fellow and his wife have to encounter before they can\r\n  put this shell of a hut into anything like a habitable form. This year\r\n  I saw a family of eight—husband, wife, two sons, and four\r\n  daughters—who were in utter discomfort, and in despair of putting\r\n  themselves in a decent condition, three or four weeks after they had\r\n  come into one of these hovels. In vain did they try to stop up the\r\n  crannies, and to fill up the holes in the floor, and to arrange their\r\n  furniture in tolerably decent order, and to keep out the weather.\r\n  Alas! what will they not suffer in the winter! There will be no\r\n  fireside enjoyment for them. They may huddle together for warmth, and\r\n  heap coals on the fire; but they will have chilly beds and a damp\r\n  hearth-stone; and the cold wind will sweep through the roof, and\r\n  window, and crazy door-place, in spite of all their endeavours to\r\n  exclude it.\r\n\r\n  “The general character of the best of the old-fashioned hind’s\r\n  cottages in this neighbourhood is bad at the best. They have to bring\r\n  everything with them—partitions, window-frames, fixtures of all kinds,\r\n  grates, and a substitute for ceiling; for they are, as I have already\r\n  called them, mere sheds. They have no byre for their cows nor sties\r\n  for their pigs, no pumps or wells, nothing to promote cleanliness or\r\n  comfort. The average size of these sheds is about 24 by 16. They are\r\n  dark and unwholesome. The windows do not open; and many of them are\r\n  not larger than 20 inches by 16; and into this place are crowded 8,\r\n  10, or even 12 persons.”\r\n\r\nIn a selection of plans and drawings of labourers’ dwellings will be\r\nfound a sketch of a group of hinds’ cottages, such as those described by\r\nDr. Gilly.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the inquiry into Scotland shows the external and\r\ninternal condition of the poorer classes of the population to be still\r\nmore deplorable. The condition of a large portion of the labouring\r\npopulation of the smaller towns, and of the rural districts, is\r\ndisplayed in the Report of Dr. Scott Alison, on the sanitary condition\r\nand general economy of the population of Tranent; in the Report of Mr.\r\nStevenson, on the condition of the town of Musselburgh; that of Dr. Sym,\r\non the town of Ayr, to which further reference will subsequently be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThe description given of the houses of labourers of Lochmaben, by _Mr.\r\nWilson_, surgeon, is one which characterizes a large class of houses\r\nthroughout Scotland:—\r\n\r\n  “In Lochmaben, they are surrounded by low meadow lands subject to\r\n  frequent inundations, marshes and lakes, with dunghills and pools of\r\n  dirty water, in which vegetable substances are soaked for the purpose\r\n  of making manure on all sides of the dwellings. These houses, similar\r\n  to the dwellings of the generality of the labouring classes, consist\r\n  of a building 30 feet in length by 16 feet in breadth within the\r\n  walls; the floor is formed of clay; ceiling, if any, generally formed\r\n  by spars of wood laid close together, and covered with dry turf; one\r\n  front door and two front windows. This building is usually occupied by\r\n  two families, entering by the same door; the partitions are formed by\r\n  the back of the beds, which will be best understood by describing them\r\n  as wooden boxes open on one side; the windows rarely are made to open,\r\n  so that they are ventilated by the door; but having little fuel, the\r\n  door must be kept shut to maintain warmth, and the chimneys being\r\n  badly constructed, the dwelling is often full of smoke. Potatoes are\r\n  often kept under the beds. There are no proper receptacles for filth\r\n  attached to the houses.”\r\n\r\nThe most wretched of the stationary population of which I have been able\r\nto obtain any account, or that I have ever seen, was that which I saw in\r\ncompany with _Dr. Arnott_, and others, in the wynds of Edinburgh and\r\nGlasgow.\r\n\r\nI prefer citing his description of the residences we visited:—\r\n\r\n  “In the survey which I had the opportunity of making in September,\r\n  1840, of the state of Edinburgh and Glasgow, all appeared confirmatory\r\n  of the view of the subject of fevers submitted to the Poor Law\r\n  Commissioners by those who prepared the Report in London.\r\n\r\n  “In Glasgow, which I first visited, it was found that the great mass\r\n  of the fever cases occurred in the low wynds and dirty narrow streets\r\n  and courts, in which, because lodging was there cheapest, the poorest\r\n  and most destitute naturally had their abodes. From one such locality,\r\n  between Argyll-street and the river, 754 of about 5000 cases of fever\r\n  which occurred in the previous year were carried to the hospitals. In\r\n  a perambulation on the morning of September 24th, with Mr. Chadwick,\r\n  Dr. Alison, Dr. Cowan (since deceased, who had laboured so\r\n  meritoriously to alleviate the misery of the poor in Glasgow), the\r\n  police magistrate, and others, we examined these wynds, and, to give\r\n  an idea of the whole vicinity, I may state as follows:—\r\n\r\n  “We entered a dirty low passage like a house door, which led from the\r\n  street through the first house to a square court immediately behind,\r\n  which court, with the exception of a narrow path around it leading to\r\n  another long passage through a second house, was occupied entirely as\r\n  a dung receptacle of the most disgusting kind. Beyond this court the\r\n  second passage led to a second square court, occupied in the same way\r\n  by its dunghill; and from this court there was yet a third passage\r\n  leading to a third court, and third dungheap. There were no privies or\r\n  drains there, and the dungheaps received all filth which the swarm of\r\n  wretched inhabitants could give; and we learned that a considerable\r\n  part of the rent of the houses was paid by the produce of the\r\n  dungheaps. Thus, worse off than wild animals, many of which withdraw\r\n  to a distance and conceal their ordure, the dwellers in these courts\r\n  had converted their shame into a kind of money by which their lodging\r\n  was to be paid. The interiors of these houses and their inmates\r\n  corresponded with the exteriors. We saw half-dressed wretches crowding\r\n  together to be warm; and in one bed, although in the middle of the\r\n  day, several women were imprisoned under a blanket, because as many\r\n  others who had on their backs all the articles of dress that belonged\r\n  to the party were then out of doors in the streets. This picture is so\r\n  shocking that, without ocular proof, one would be disposed to doubt\r\n  the possibility of the facts; and yet there is perhaps no old town in\r\n  Europe that does not furnish parallel examples. London, before the\r\n  great fire of 1666, had few drains and had many such scenes, and the\r\n  consequence was, a pestilence occurring at intervals of about 12\r\n  years, each destroying at an average about a fourth of the\r\n  inhabitants.\r\n\r\n  “Who can wonder that pestilential disease should originate and spread\r\n  in such situations? And, as a contrast, it may be observed here, that\r\n  when the kelp manufacture lately ceased on the western shores of\r\n  Scotland, a vast population of the lowest class of people who had been\r\n  supported chiefly by the wages of kelp-labour remained in extreme\r\n  want, with cold, hunger, and almost despair pressing them down—yet, as\r\n  their habitations were scattered and in pure air, cases of fever did\r\n  not arise among them.\r\n\r\n  “Edinburgh stands on a site beautifully varied by hill and hollow, and\r\n  owing to this, unusual facilities are afforded for perfect drainage;\r\n  but the old part of the town was built long before the importance of\r\n  drainage was understood in Britain, and in the unchanged parts there\r\n  is none but by the open channels in the streets, wynds, and closes or\r\n  courts. To remedy the want of covered drains, there is in many\r\n  neighbourhoods a very active service of scavengers to remove\r\n  everything which open drains cannot be allowed to carry; but this does\r\n  not prevent the air from being much more contaminated by the frequent\r\n  stirring and sweeping of impurities than if the transport were\r\n  effected under ground; and there are here and there enclosed spaces\r\n  between houses too small to be used for any good purpose but not\r\n  neglected for bad, and to which the scavengers have not access.\r\n\r\n  “Another defect in some parts of Edinburgh is the great size and\r\n  height of the houses (some of them exceeding ten stories), with common\r\n  stairs, sometimes as filthy as the streets or wynds to which they\r\n  open. By this construction the chance of cleanliness is lessened, the\r\n  labour of carrying up necessaries, and particularly water for the\r\n  purposes of purifying is increased; and if any malaria or contagion\r\n  exist in the house, the probability of its passing from dwelling to\r\n  dwelling on the same stair is much greater than if there were no\r\n  communication but through the open air. Illustrating how malaria may\r\n  be produced, I may state that in making a round of observation with\r\n  Mr. Chadwick, attended by the Police Superintendent, and others, we\r\n  visited a house at the back of the Canongate, which in former days had\r\n  been the chief inn of the city, but now, with its internal court-yard\r\n  of steep ascent, is occupied by families of the labouring classes. In\r\n  the court-yard a widow of respectable appearance, who answered some of\r\n  our questions, occupied a room which appeared on the ground-floor, as\r\n  seen from the court, but was above a stable, now used as a pigsty,\r\n  opening to the lower level of the external street. A little while\r\n  before, on the occasion of the dungheap being removed from the pigsty,\r\n  two children who lived with her, a daughter and a niece, were made ill\r\n  by the effluvia from below, and both died within a few days.\r\n\r\n  “The facts here referred to go far to explain why fatal fever has been\r\n  more common in Edinburgh than from other circumstances would have been\r\n  anticipated.”\r\n\r\nIt might admit of dispute, but, on the whole, it appeared to us that\r\nboth the structural arrangements and the condition of the population in\r\nGlasgow was the worst of any we had seen in any part of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.—PUBLIC ARRANGEMENTS EXTERNAL TO THE RESIDENCES BY WHICH THE SANITARY\r\n           CONDITION OF THE LABOURING POPULATION IS AFFECTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nI now propose to bring under consideration those parts of the various\r\nlocal reports and communications which most prominently set forth\r\nspecial defects that apparently admit of specific remedies.\r\n\r\nThe defects which are the most important, and which come most\r\nimmediately within practical legislative and administrative control, are\r\nthose chiefly _external_ to the dwellings of the population, and\r\nprincipally arise from the neglect of drainage. The remedies include the\r\nmeans for drainage simply, _i. e._, the means for the removal of an\r\nexcess of moisture; and\r\n\r\nThe means for the removal of the noxious refuse of houses, streets, and\r\nroads, by sewerage, by supplies of water, and by the service of\r\nscavengers and sweepers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Town Drainage of Streets and Houses._\r\n\r\nThe sanitary effects obtainable by an efficient town drainage,\r\nindependently of all other measures, is exhibited in various parts of\r\nthe country by such particular instances as the following:—\r\n\r\n_Dr. Baker_, in his report on the sanitary condition of Derby states:—\r\n\r\n  “At the back of the whole row (on the north side of the street) there\r\n  runs a series of little gardens, each house possessing one, in width\r\n  equal to the frontage of the house it belongs to, and in length 56\r\n  feet. To every five houses there is a pump; and at the bottom of each\r\n  garden a double privy, answering for two houses, the cesspool shallow,\r\n  and open to the air; and to this nuisance many have added a pigsty,\r\n  and dung or rubbish heap. The inhabitants of this street are poor\r\n  people, chiefly silk-weavers, and what are here called\r\n  frame-work-knitters or stockingers.\r\n\r\n  “There are on this (the north) side of the street 54 houses, and\r\n  between October, 1837, and the latter part of March, 1838, the\r\n  families inhabiting six adjoining houses in the middle of the row were\r\n  grievously afflicted with typhus fever, whilst those who dwelt in the\r\n  remaining 48 houses were comparatively healthy.\r\n\r\n  “The following list will give at one view the details of this\r\n  visitation.\r\n\r\n  “The houses are numbered from the bottom of the hill towards the top.\r\n\r\n ┌──────┬───────────┬───────┬──────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n │Number│Name of the│Number │                 REMARKS.                 │\r\n │of the│  Family.  │  of   │                                          │\r\n │House.│           │Persons│                                          │\r\n │      │           │  ill  │                                          │\r\n │      │           │ with  │                                          │\r\n │      │           │Fever. │                                          │\r\n ├──────┼───────────┼───────┼──────────────────────────────────────────┤\r\n │No. 25│Langton.   │   3   │Children, all of whom recovered.          │\r\n │No. 26│Dearu.     │   4   │Man and wife, the former died.            │\r\n │No. 27│Bailey.    │   1   │Man, who recovered.                       │\r\n │No. 28│Nettleship.│   4   │Three children, and subsequently their    │\r\n │      │           │       │  mother.

Also, that in the gardens of the\r\n  upper 21 or 22 houses this ditch had been filled up; and sinks and\r\n  drains, communicating with the main sewer, that passes down the middle\r\n  of the street, had been placed between each garden and the\r\n  dwelling-house. At this point too there is a brick wall, carried down\r\n  to the bottom of the garden, and dividing this property from the\r\n  adjoining, and it is very probable that this wall assisted in checking\r\n  the spread of the fever from the six infected houses, at which part of\r\n  the row we have now arrived.\r\n\r\n  “The state of the premises belonging to these ill-fated houses was as\r\n  follows:—The ditch already alluded to as passing at the bottom of the\r\n  gardens was here not filled up; there were not any sinks and drains,\r\n  and the cesspools were overflowing into the ditch, which, here and\r\n  there obstructed, formed a succession of foul and stinking pools, from\r\n  four to six feet wide; whilst the earth of the gardens was perpetually\r\n  saturated with the offensive moisture exuding from them.\r\n\r\n  “The want of drains, or their faulty construction, may render any\r\n  situation unhealthy; nor must it be supposed that because high lands\r\n  in the open country seldom require draining, that it is therefore\r\n  little needed in elevated portions of a town, for in the latter there\r\n  are always dirt and slops that require carrying away from the houses\r\n  that produce them. And inasmuch as drains in high situations never get\r\n  such a thorough washing out by rain and natural moisture as those do\r\n  which, from being in lower grounds, receive a swollen and accumulated\r\n  stream, the former require the greater attention to keep them from\r\n  becoming foul and obstructed: and it is not a little remarkable that\r\n  three elevated parts of the town of Derby are hardly ever exempt from\r\n  fever. They are the Burton-road (district No. 2 in the table),\r\n  Litchurch-street (district No. 3), and Parker’s Flats (district No.\r\n  12).\r\n\r\n  “In the latter end of the year 1837 and beginning of 1838,\r\n  Litchurch-street afforded a striking instance of a situation which\r\n  promised exemption from malaria and disease, being heavily visited by\r\n  typhus fever, caused, as I shall show, by the most wilful inattention\r\n  to drainage.\r\n\r\n  “Litchurch-street is situated in the southern suburb of Derby, from\r\n  which indeed, although forming a part of the Derby union, it is\r\n  separated by intervening fields and nursery-grounds belonging to the\r\n  General Infirmary. Its course is nearly east and west, running down\r\n  the side of a gentle declivity. The houses in Litchurch-street have\r\n  not been built many years; are rather small, but are double houses,\r\n  having a front and back room on the ground floor, and over these a\r\n  front and back bed-room.\r\n\r\n  “Descending the hill to the remaining 24 houses (below those\r\n  infected), and which, from their standing upon lower ground, might\r\n  reasonably be expected to have fared worse, I soon discovered from\r\n  whence their protection came. The land adjoining the Litchurch-street\r\n  gardens belongs, as I have already stated, to the General Infirmary,\r\n  and the governors of that institution had eight years before built a\r\n  wall in the former course of the ditch, before spoken of, which wall\r\n  extended from the foot of the hill as far up as the house No. 24; at\r\n  the same time they had filled up the ditch, carrying its contents by a\r\n  drain away from the gardens below and into the nearest public sewer:\r\n  now reference to the list detailing the amount and progress of the\r\n  fever on this occasion will show that No. 25 was the first house\r\n  affected. The connexion therefore between the facts here furnished and\r\n  the tragedy of the six houses is too obvious to require further\r\n  comment.\r\n\r\n  “I shall conclude this part of my subject by adding, that from motives\r\n  of both humanity and economy, the Board of Guardians and the governors\r\n  of the infirmary jointly exerted themselves to get rid of so serious a\r\n  nuisance, that the latter, at an expense of more than 50_l._, extended\r\n  the wall of separation between Litchurch-street and their own lands,\r\n  but that, in all other respects, the evil remains now (two years\r\n  since) as it was then; nor was there found any law that would compel\r\n  its removal, the place complained of being private property.\r\n\r\n  “My friend Mr. Harwood, surgeon of the Derby union, informs me that in\r\n  Canal-street (district 5 of table 1) five sisters in one family were\r\n  successively attacked with typhus fever, caused by the escape of foul\r\n  air from a drain.\r\n\r\n  “It appears that a drain, coming from some neighbouring privies, had\r\n  been carried so near to the house in which they resided as to form\r\n  part of the boundary wall of the cellar, which had for some time\r\n  previous become too offensive to be used.\r\n\r\n  “Four months elapsed before this family became free from disease; no\r\n  return of which, however, has taken place since the removal of the\r\n  drain, which now passes at a greater distance.\r\n\r\n  “Taken altogether, I think that in large towns (and villages also)\r\n  there is hardly any source of disease more powerful as to its\r\n  pernicious influence, or more general as to extent, than defective\r\n  drainage.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. John Rayner_, the medical officer of the Stockport union, states in\r\nhis report on the condition of that town:—\r\n\r\n  “There is a street of about 200 yards in length, the houses of which\r\n  are of excellent construction, with very few exceptions, and without\r\n  those unhealthy places, viz., cellar dwellings. The upper third of it\r\n  is unpaved and without sewerage. It is 10 yards wide, and the\r\n  inhabitants are generally very clean, as respects both their persons\r\n  and dwellings; and notwithstanding they are, without exception, well\r\n  fed and clad, fever has gradually prevailed, _but only on the north\r\n  side_ of the street. The situation is not a confined one, neither do\r\n  the houses differ either as to convenience or cleanliness on this side\r\n  of it.\r\n\r\n  “In the 10 houses at the upper end of this street (three of which are\r\n  untenanted) there has been 21 cases of continued fever. Every house,\r\n  with three exceptions, has had several cases, in some of them as many\r\n  as four in number. In one, five cases have occurred.\r\n\r\n  “Seeing this fact, I examined the adjoining yard and gardens, and\r\n  found a stagnant pool of water and an open ditch about two feet wide,\r\n  into which the refuse water from the houses, and from two pigsties,\r\n  was allowed to accumulate. It is about 15 or 20 yards in length.\r\n  Adjoining the gable end of one of the untenanted houses were found\r\n  heaps of ordure and other refuse matters undergoing the process of\r\n  decay.\r\n\r\n  “The west end of this street opens into some gardens, where free\r\n  ventilation may easily take place, and, I have no doubt, has prevented\r\n  the spread of infection to the south side of it.”\r\n\r\nThe following is the comparison of the different mortality in a drained\r\nand an undrained district, made by _Mr. Crowfoot_, surgeon, of Beccles,\r\none of the most eminent of the medical practitioners in Suffolk. In a\r\nletter to Mr. Twisleton, the Assistant Commissioner, he states—\r\n\r\n  “You are aware that these two towns of nearly equal population are\r\n  nearly alike as to natural advantages of situation, &c., except that\r\n  Bungay, having a larger proportion of rural population inhabiting the\r\n  district called Bungay Uplands, ought to be more healthy than Beccles,\r\n  which has nearly its whole population confined to the town. About 30\r\n  years since, Beccles began a system of drainage, which it has\r\n  continued to improve, till at the present time every part of the town\r\n  is well drained, and I am not aware of a single open drain in the\r\n  place. Bungay, on the contrary, with equally convenient opportunities\r\n  for drainage, has neglected its advantages in that respect, has one or\r\n  two large reservoirs for filth in the town itself, and some of its\r\n  principal drains are open ones. The result you will see is, that\r\n  Bungay, with a smaller proportion of town inhabitants, has become of\r\n  late years less healthy than Beccles. I have carefully taken the\r\n  number of burials from the parish registers of each town for the last\r\n  30 years, and dividing them into decennial periods, I have calculated\r\n  the proportion which the deaths bore to the mean population, between\r\n  one census and the other, during each 10 years; the only possible\r\n  source of fallacy is the want of the census for 1841; but in its\r\n  absence I have supposed the same rate of increase as took place\r\n  between that of 1821 and that of 1831 for each place. Sinking\r\n  fractions, the following has been the proportion of deaths to the\r\n  population in the two towns:—\r\n\r\n                                           Beccles.   Bungay.\r\n          Between the years 1811 and 1821   1 in 67   1 in 69\r\n          Between the years 1821 and 1831   1 in 72   1 in 67\r\n          Between the years 1831 and 1841   1 in 71   1 in 59\r\n\r\n  You will therefore see that the rate of mortality has gradually\r\n  diminished in Beccles since it has been drained, whilst in Bungay,\r\n  notwithstanding its larger proportion of rural population, it has\r\n  considerably increased.\r\n\r\n  “The Ditchingham Factory may have given a greater increase of\r\n  population to Bungay than I have allowed for, but, on the other hand,\r\n  the Roman Catholics and the Independents bury many of their dead in\r\n  their own ground, which I have not calculated upon. Since writing the\r\n  above, I have been over to Bungay, to examine more particularly the\r\n  state of its drainage, which is much worse than I had any idea of. If\r\n  their population should much increase, their mortality will increase\r\n  much faster.”\r\n\r\nA frightful picture of a considerable proportion of the labouring\r\npopulation of Leeds in respect to sewerage and drainage is afforded by\r\nthe report of _Mr. Baker_, who gives the following instance of\r\namendment:—\r\n\r\n  “In one of the streets of Leeds where stagnant water used frequently\r\n  to accumulate after rain, and where there was perpetually occurring\r\n  cases of fever of a malignant character, a deputation of females\r\n  waited upon me in my capacity of town counsellor to ask if any remedy\r\n  could be applied to this nuisance, which they declared was not only\r\n  offensive but deadly. I directed them to communicate with the owner of\r\n  the property, and to say that if the grievance was not remedied I\r\n  should take further steps to enforce it. Never hearing again from the\r\n  deputation, I presumed that the remedy had been applied, and had\r\n  forgotten the circumstance until the house surgeon of the fever\r\n  hospital in 1840, in noticing the localities from whence fever cases\r\n  were most frequently brought to the institution, remarked that\r\n  ‘formerly many cases of malignant fever were brought in from ——\r\n  street, but for two or three years there had been none or not more\r\n  than one or two.’”\r\n\r\n_Mr. John Wright_, the relieving officer of the Tamworth union, states,\r\nthat the following extracts exhibit the condition in which large masses\r\nof the population are kept by the neglect of the proper means of town\r\ndrainage, and of the house cleansing, practicable by means of drains:—\r\n\r\n  “Some of the houses in the back streets and courts of Tamworth,\r\n  particularly those comprised in Class No. 1, are in a wretched state\r\n  with respect to the common conveniences of life, being adjacent to\r\n  stagnant ditches and pools of water, and having only one privy, common\r\n  to many houses, and hemmed in with piggeries, &c., most of these\r\n  houses having no back doors, the consequence of which is, that fevers\r\n  and other disorders, generated by filth and malaria, are very\r\n  prevalent, particularly in humid weather.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Elias Barlow_, the relieving officer of the Wolstanton and Burslem\r\nunion, states that—\r\n\r\n  “The townships of Knutton and Chesterton have been visited with fever\r\n  for several months; and it still continues its raging influence,\r\n  particularly in Knutton, the reason of which appears to me to be want\r\n  of drainage, owing to the houses having been built upon low marshy\r\n  ground; and also want of ventilation, owing to the houses being too\r\n  small and having no back doors; it first made its appearance in the\r\n  lowest class of houses, but has since extended to others.”\r\n\r\nThe condition of the labouring population of Liverpool, in respect to\r\ndrainage, is thus described in the report of _Dr. Duncan_:—\r\n\r\n  “The sewerage of Liverpool was so very imperfect, that about 10 years\r\n  ago a local Act was procured, appointing commissioners with power to\r\n  levy a rate on the parish for the construction of sewers. Under this\r\n  Act, which expires next year, about 100,000_l._. have been expended in\r\n  the formation of sewers along the main streets, but many of these are\r\n  still unsewered; and with regard to the streets inhabited by the\r\n  working classes, I believe that the great majority are without sewers,\r\n  and that where they do exist they are of a very imperfect kind unless\r\n  where the ground has a natural inclination, therefore the surface\r\n  water and fluid refuse of every kind stagnate in the street, and add,\r\n  especially in hot weather, their pestilential influence to that of the\r\n  more solid filth already mentioned. With regard to the courts, I doubt\r\n  whether there is a single court in Liverpool which communicates with\r\n  the street by an underground drain, the only means afforded for\r\n  carrying off the fluid dirt being a narrow, open, shallow gutter,\r\n  which sometimes exists, but even this is very generally choked up with\r\n  stagnant filth.\r\n\r\n  “There can be no doubt that the emanations from this pestilential\r\n  surface, in connexion with other causes, are a frequent source of\r\n  fever among the inhabitants of these undrained localities. I may\r\n  mention two instances in corroboration of this assertion:—In\r\n  consequence of finding that not less than 63 cases of fever had\r\n  occurred in one year in Union-court Banastre-street, (containing 12\r\n  houses,) I visited the court in order to ascertain, if possible, their\r\n  origin, and I found the whole court inundated with fluid filth which\r\n  had oozed through the walls from two adjoining ash-pits or cesspools,\r\n  and which had no means of escape in consequence of the court being\r\n  below the level of the street, and having no drain. The court was\r\n  owned by two different landlords, one of whom had offered to construct\r\n  a drain provided the other would join him in the expense; but this\r\n  offer having been refused, the court had remained for two or three\r\n  years in the state in which I saw it; and I was informed by one of the\r\n  inhabitants that the fever was constantly occurring there. The house\r\n  nearest the ash-pit had been untenanted for nearly three years in\r\n  consequence of the filthy matter oozing up through the floor, and the\r\n  occupiers of the adjoining houses were unable to take their meals\r\n  without previously closing the doors and windows. Another court in\r\n  North-street, consisting of only four small houses I found in a\r\n  somewhat similar condition, the air being contaminated by the\r\n  emanations from two filthy ruinous privies, a large open ash-pit and a\r\n  stratum of semi-fluid abomination covering the whole surface of the\r\n  court.\r\n\r\n  “From the absence of drains and sewers, there are of course few\r\n  cellars entirely free from damp; many of those in low situations are\r\n  literally inundated after a fall of rain. To remedy the evil, the\r\n  inhabitants frequently make little holes or wells at the foot of the\r\n  cellar steps or in the floor itself; and notwithstanding these\r\n  contrivances, it has been necessary in some cases to take the door off\r\n  its hinges and lay it on the floor supported by bricks, in order to\r\n  protect the inhabitants from the wet. Nor is this the full extent of\r\n  the evil; the fluid matter of the court privies sometimes oozes\r\n  through into the adjoining cellars, rendering them uninhabitable by\r\n  any one whose olfactories retain the slightest sensibility. In one\r\n  cellar in Lace-street I was told that the filthy water thus collected\r\n  measured not less than two feet in depth; and in another cellar, a\r\n  well, four feet deep, into which this stinking fluid was allowed to\r\n  drain, was discovered below the bed where the family slept!”\r\n\r\nHe also states,—\r\n\r\n  “There are upwards of 8,000 inhabited cellars in Liverpool, and I\r\n  estimate their occupants at from 35,000 to 40,000.”\r\n\r\nHe adds that—\r\n\r\n  “In a Report lately made by the Surveyors, appointed by the Town\r\n  Council to examine the condition of the court and cellar residences\r\n  within the borough, it is stated that of 2,398 _courts_ examined,\r\n  1,705 were closed at one end, so as to prevent thorough ventilation.\r\n  Of 6,571 _cellars_, whose condition is reported on, 2,988 are stated\r\n  to be either wet or damp, and nearly one-third of the whole number are\r\n  from 5 to 6 feet below the level of the street.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. Jenks_, in his report on the condition of the town of Brighton,\r\nstates,—\r\n\r\n  “Owing to the imperfect and insufficient drainage of the town, the\r\n  inhabitants are compelled to have recourse to numerous cesspools as\r\n  receptacles for superabundant water, and refuse of all kinds; and to\r\n  save the inconvenience of frequently emptying them, they dig below the\r\n  hard coombe rock till they come to the shingles, where all the liquid\r\n  filth drains away. The consequence is inevitable; the springs in the\r\n  lower part of the town must be contaminated.”\r\n\r\nBut even in Birmingham, which, as will be seen, enjoys almost an\r\nimmunity from fever in consequence of the fortunate position of the town\r\nconferring advantages in respect to drainage, and the good construction\r\nof the houses, it appears from the report made by the physicians and\r\nsurgeons, that the drainage is in many places extremely defective.\r\n\r\n  “The great sewers of the town open into the Rea, or into the rivulets\r\n  which discharge their contents into that stream. In some places these\r\n  rivulets are now covered over and constitute sewers. The present\r\n  sewers, which are numerous and large, appear to be sufficient to carry\r\n  off any storms or floods to which the town is liable, and no part of\r\n  the town is subject to inundations. The principal streets are well\r\n  drained, but this is far from the case with respect to many of the\r\n  inferior streets, and to many, or rather most, of the courts, which,\r\n  especially in the old parts of the town, are dirty and neglected, with\r\n  water stagnating in them. These require immediate attention, and care\r\n  ought to be taken that the depth of the main drains is sufficient to\r\n  drain the cellars of the adjoining premises, which is not the case in\r\n  some parts of the town. It is also important that a system of proper\r\n  drainage should be enforced at the commencement of the building of any\r\n  new streets or houses. The want of some regulations in this respect\r\n  often causes the accumulation of putrid water in ditches and pools in\r\n  the immediate vicinity of newly-erected buildings. In some parts of\r\n  the borough, as at Edgbaston, there are but few public underground\r\n  sewers, and the water from the houses is discharged into the ditches\r\n  or gutters by the sides of the roads, where it stagnates. In the\r\n  courts the drains are often above ground, and not covered in, and\r\n  discharge their contents into the gutters or kennels in the streets.\r\n  We do not think that much advantage is derived from having small\r\n  underground drains in the courts if the gutters are laid upon a proper\r\n  slope and are kept in proper repair, for the weirs or grates of small\r\n  underground drains are very apt to be out of order, or to become\r\n  choked, in which case accumulations of filthy fluids take place above\r\n  them.”\r\n\r\nThe inquiry into the sanitary condition of the towns in Scotland shows\r\nthat similar defects stand equally in need of remedy in that part of the\r\nempire. _Mr. Burton_, in his report on the provisions of the Police Act\r\nfor the city of Edinburgh, observes:—\r\n\r\n  “Until very lately the Cowgate, a long street running along the lowest\r\n  level of a narrow valley, had only surface drains. The various alleys\r\n  from the High-street and other elevated ground open into this street.\r\n  In rainy weather they carried with them each its respective stream of\r\n  filth, and thus the Cowgate bore the aspect of a gigantic sewer\r\n  receiving its tributary drains. A committee of private gentlemen had\r\n  the merit of making a spacious sewer 830 yards long in this street at\r\n  a cost of 2000_l._ collected by subscription. The utmost extent to\r\n  which they received assistance from the police, consisted in being\r\n  vested with the authority of the Act as a protection from the\r\n  interruption of private parties. During the operation they were\r\n  nevertheless harassed by claims of damage for obstructing the\r\n  causeway, and their minutes, with a perusal of which I have been\r\n  favoured, show that they experienced a series of interruptions from\r\n  the neighbouring occupants, likely to discourage others from following\r\n  their example.”\r\n\r\nIn a communication from _Mr. William Chambers_, he observes—\r\n\r\n  “Within these few years, the practice of introducing water-closets\r\n  into houses has become pretty general, wherever it is practicable; but\r\n  in the greater part of the old town nothing of the kind can be\r\n  accomplished from the want of drains. There are drains in the leading\r\n  thoroughfares, but few closes possess these conveniences, and water is\r\n  also sparingly introduced into these confined situations. You will\r\n  therefore understand that a want of tributary drains and water is a\r\n  fundamental cause of the uncleanly condition of the town. Of water of\r\n  the finest kind there is indeed a plenteous supply, but unfortunately\r\n  this is a monopoly in the hands of a joint-stock company, and\r\n  excepting at two or three wells, all the water introduced into the\r\n  town has to be specially paid for, in the form of a tax upon the\r\n  rental, by those who use it.”\r\n\r\nAs in England, the ignorance or neglect upon this matter is not confined\r\nto the labouring population of the capital. _Dr. Scott Alison_, in his\r\nreport on the condition of Tranent and the adjacent districts, observes\r\nthat—\r\n\r\n  “There is nothing like an efficient system of drainage in Tranent and\r\n  the other villages in the district. There is a piece of drain here and\r\n  there, but it is very inefficient. There is not even a sufficient\r\n  water-course in the main streets of Tranent; and it frequently\r\n  happens, during and after a heavy fall of rain, that the carriage-road\r\n  is covered with water, and that some of the lower class of houses are\r\n  inundated. In a few parts of the town the water-course is covered with\r\n  stones or flags. These occasionally fall in, and openings are made.\r\n  These openings are generally left unrepaired, and are not filled up.\r\n  People frequently get hurt by stepping into them when it is dark. I\r\n  have myself met with an accident; and serious mischief would very\r\n  frequently occur did people not pay particular attention to avoid\r\n  them.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. Sym_, in his report on the sanitary condition of the town of Ayr,\r\nstates that—\r\n\r\n  “A good covered sewer traverses the principal streets of the new part\r\n  of Ayr; but the old part of the burgh, and both Newton and Wallacetown\r\n  have merely shallow open gutters along the sides of the causeway.\r\n  These gutters receive all the liquid refuse from the closes and alleys\r\n  which communicate with the street, and which are generally causewayed\r\n  in such a way that one side is considerably higher than the other, so\r\n  as to permit water to find its way to the opposite edge. This sort of\r\n  drainage might suffice for all useful purposes in our dry sandy soil\r\n  if we had an adequate establishment of scavengers; but the gutters in\r\n  many of the streets, and in all the closes inhabited by the poor are\r\n  so much neglected, that they are never free from the stinking residuum\r\n  of foul water. In Newton and Wallacetown, the drainage is exceedingly\r\n  imperfect; indeed, in most streets of the latter it may be said\r\n  scarcely to exist, and as the surface is very flat, almost the whole\r\n  of the liquid putrescence and filth which are thrown out from the\r\n  houses is allowed to filter through the sand, or evaporate in the sun,\r\n  leaving a most offensive paste at the sides of the streets, and in the\r\n  passages through the houses. This is the more to be regretted, that\r\n  the beautiful state of cleanliness of the new part of Ayr, shows with\r\n  how little labour it might be obviated with the aid of our absorbent\r\n  soil and free atmosphere. There are some streets, the main street of\r\n  Newton in particular, which have such inequalities in the causewayed\r\n  footpaths, and such want of escape by the gutters, that it is\r\n  impossible to find one’s way through them in a dark night, without\r\n  many a plunge into the filth. There is everywhere sufficient slope\r\n  toward the river to render drainage perfectly effectual, if properly\r\n  executed.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Forrest_, the surgeon, in his account of Stirling, states that—\r\n\r\n  “The drains or sewers, called in Stirling ‘_sivers_,’ are all open and\r\n  sloping. On the public streets they are, in general, well constructed,\r\n  but in the closes their construction is so very bad that scarcely any\r\n  of them run well. The only supply of water, so far as I know, which\r\n  they receive, is from the heavens. The inhabitants of Stirling, during\r\n  many months of the year, do not obtain water sufficient for their\r\n  domestic wants, and they cannot, therefore, have any to spare for\r\n  their sewers. There is a regularly appointed service of scavengers,\r\n  but it is inefficient. A few old men sweep the public streets from\r\n  time to time, and the sweepings thus collected are removed in a cart,\r\n  without any apparent attention to time or order. Sometimes the\r\n  sweepings remain on the streets for many days. To show how matters of\r\n  medical police are neglected, I shall state a few facts which are\r\n  known to every person in Stirling. 1st. The filth of the gaol,\r\n  containing on an average 65 prisoners, is floated down the public\r\n  streets every second or third day, and emits, during the whole of its\r\n  progress down Broad-street, Bow, Baker-street, and King-street, the\r\n  principal streets in the town, the most offensive and disgusting\r\n  odour. 2nd. The slaughter-house is situated near the top of the town,\r\n  and the blood from it is allowed to flow down the public streets. 3rd.\r\n  The lower part of a dwelling-house, not more than three or four yards\r\n  from the town-house and gaol, is used as a ‘midding,’ and pigsty, the\r\n  filth being thrown into it by the window and door. 4th. There are no\r\n  public necessaries; and the common stairs and closes, and even the\r\n  public streets, are used habitually as such, by certain classes of the\r\n  community. 5th. Two drains from the castle, convey the whole filth of\r\n  it into an open field, where it spreads itself over the surface, and\r\n  pollutes the atmosphere to a very great extent. 6th. A dwelling-house\r\n  in the Castle-hill, the greater part of which is inhabited, is used by\r\n  a butcher as a slaughter-house; and some of the butchers kill sheep\r\n  and lambs in their back shops, situated under dwelling-houses. 7th.\r\n  The closes where the poor dwell, and where accumulations of filth most\r\n  abound, are, I may safely say, utterly neglected by the scavengers. In\r\n  some situations, the ventilation around the residences is good, but in\r\n  many others, and especially in the closes, it is very bad, and in my\r\n  opinion, quite irremediable.”\r\n\r\nBefore quitting this class of instances, it may here be necessary to\r\nguard against the conclusion that neglect of drainage is confined to\r\ntowns, or to numerous and crowded habitations. Similar instances may be\r\npresented, even of single and isolated houses, and of small groups of\r\nrural cottages, in almost every district. Of this last class of cases I\r\ngive only one instance, supplied by the evidence of _Mr. J. Thomson_, of\r\nClitheroe:—\r\n\r\n  “Have you not had amongst your own people an instance of pestilence\r\n  occasioned by the neglect of removable causes of disease?—In the\r\n  summer of 1839 some remarkable cases of fever occurred in my immediate\r\n  neighbourhood amongst the inhabitants in my employment, of a small\r\n  cluster of houses called Littlemoor. The situation of this little spot\r\n  has always been considered, and justly, as remarkably healthy and\r\n  agreeable, the soil around it being dry, and not marshy, as the name\r\n  would seem to imply. It is situated on gently sloping ground, about a\r\n  mile from the town of Clitheroe, and freely exposed on all sides to\r\n  the wind. It contained six houses and 21 inhabitants at the time of\r\n  the fever. The houses are built in three distinct groups, round an\r\n  irregular area of from 50 to 60 feet square. A single, inadequate, and\r\n  half-choked-up drain, originally constructed more than 40 years ago,\r\n  for the only cottager, then existing on the spot, was the only\r\n  underground outlet for the filth, and sink, and surplus water of these\r\n  habitations; the rest was carried off by a deep and open ditch filled\r\n  with grass and weeds; this ditch spread out, about 100 yards to the\r\n  north, into a shallow stagnant pool, in summer green and fœtid; from\r\n  which was conveyed all the water that could flow during that season\r\n  past and amongst the cottages at Littlemoor. Into the centre of the\r\n  open area or yard was poured all the filth of the houses in open\r\n  channels, and thence, by the above-mentioned underground drain,\r\n  conveyed away. This state of things was bad enough, but was rendered\r\n  still worse by the erection recently of a pigsty, the litter and filth\r\n  of which not only obstructed the drain, but occasioned a pool of\r\n  abomination of the most perilous and disgusting nature. At the time I\r\n  saw it—the commencement of the fever—it was overflowing into the\r\n  foundation of the principal habitation, and had infected the whole\r\n  house with its stench, and was making its way by innumerable black and\r\n  fœtid streams through a small shrubbery, the area of which it wholly\r\n  covered, into the deep and open ditch. Believing this to be the source\r\n  of the pestilence, I had the sty instantly pulled down, the filth\r\n  removed, and a large drain brought up to the centre of the yard,\r\n  terminating in small covered troughs to each habitation. This was in\r\n  the middle of August, and from the hour of the removal of the filth no\r\n  fresh case of fever occurred. The first case was on the 12th of May,\r\n  and was followed by another in the same house on the 27th. In June\r\n  there were three cases; and in July six; in August four; in all, 15;\r\n  of which nine were the resident inhabitants, in a population of 21;\r\n  and the remaining six, nurses and attendants on the sick, obtained\r\n  from the immediate neighbourhood. No fever prevailed at the time in\r\n  Clitheroe. One case was fatal, and the health of a most valuable\r\n  member of that small community was so seriously affected by the fever\r\n  as to cause his death in a short time. A visitor and attendant on the\r\n  funeral of the person deceased at Littlemoor, and who took the fever,\r\n  died also. This spot has remained, and I doubt not will continue,\r\n  healthy ever since.\r\n\r\n  “The medical gentleman, Mr. Garstang, of Clitheroe, who attended the\r\n  preceding case, has communicated to me the equally striking and\r\n  instructive statement I subjoin:—At Chatburn, a village to the north\r\n  of Clitheroe, he was called to attend a patient in fever, in the month\r\n  of May of the same year 1839. The first object that struck his eye on\r\n  approaching the house was a long pole, with a bunch at the end, black\r\n  and filthy from its recent use in forcing a choked-up and inaccessible\r\n  drain, which passed between and under the gable-ends of two closely\r\n  contiguous houses, only a few inches apart, one of which contained his\r\n  patient. From this single case and house Mr. G. ascertained that 11\r\n  cases arose, by which means the fever was spread through the country,\r\n  where it prevailed with great severity, and terminated, in many\r\n  instances, fatally. There was no fever but what could be traced to\r\n  this, and no other discoverable source.”\r\n\r\n\r\n              _Street and Road Cleansing: Road Pavements._\r\n\r\nThe local arrangements for the cleansing and drainage of towns, &c.,\r\ngenerally present only instances of varieties of grievous defects from\r\nincompleteness and from the want of science or combination of means for\r\nthe attainment of the requisite ends. Thus the local reports abound with\r\ninstances of expensive main-drains, which from ignorant construction as\r\nto the levels, do not perform their office, and do accumulate\r\npestilential refuse; others, which have proper levels, but from the want\r\nof proper supplies of water do not act; others, which act only partially\r\nor by surface drainage, in consequence of the neglect of communication\r\nfrom the houses to the drains; others, where there are drains\r\ncommunicating from the houses, but where the house-drains do not act, or\r\nonly act in spreading the surface of the matter from cesspools, and\r\nincreasing the fœtid exhalations from it in consequence of the want of\r\nsupplies of water; others again, as in some of the best quarters of the\r\nmetropolis, where the supplies of water are adequate, and where the\r\ndrains act in the removal of refuse from the house, but where from want\r\nof moderate scientific knowledge or care in their construction, each\r\ndrain acts like the neck of a large retort, and serves to introduce into\r\nthe house the subtle gas which spreads disease from the accumulations in\r\nthe sewers.[3] Other districts there are where their structural\r\narrangements may be completed, and water supplied, and the under\r\ndrainage in action, and yet pestilential accumulations be found spread\r\nbefore the doors of the population in consequence of the defective\r\nconstruction, and the neglect of the surface-cleansing of the streets\r\nand roads. Recently a remonstrance was made to an able and active member\r\nof a Commission of Sewers, for taking no steps to extend the drainage in\r\na wretched district of the metropolis. The reply was, a statement, that\r\na drain had been cut through a portion of it, but that it had done no\r\ngood; and the remonstrant was invited to inspect the district himself,\r\nand judge whether, with streets that were unpaved and uncleansed, wet\r\nand miry, with deep holes full of refuse, it were possible by any under\r\ndrainage to remove the evil complained of. Other districts there are in\r\nwhich the Road Commissioners or the Paving Board appears to have done\r\ntheir duty; but the benefit is prevented, and the road is kept\r\ncontinually out of repair by the neglect of the service of scavengers.\r\n\r\nAll these local defects again are referred back to the defective\r\nconstruction of the Acts of Parliament,—which generally either presume\r\nthat no science, no skill is requisite for the attainment of the\r\nobjects, or presume both to be universal,—which in some instances\r\nactually prohibit the only effectual mode of drainage, namely, that from\r\nthe houses into the main-drains; and in others, prescribe cleansing by\r\nhouse-drains without supplies of water; or prescribe the construction of\r\nroads independently of drains, and direct the execution of only part of\r\nthe necessary means, leaving other essential parts to the discretion of\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nBetween a town population similarly situated in general condition, one\r\npart inhabiting streets which are unpaved, and another inhabiting\r\nstreets that are paved, a general difference of health is observed. The\r\ntown of Portsmouth is built upon a low portion of the marshy island of\r\nPortsea. It was formerly subjected to intermittent fever, but since the\r\ntown was paved, in 1769, it was noticed by Sir Gilbert Blane, that this\r\ndisorder no longer prevailed; whilst Kilsea and the other parts of the\r\nisland retained the aguish disposition until 1793, when a drainage was\r\nmade which subdued its force.\r\n\r\nSuch strongly marked effects on the health of the population have\r\nfollowed in many places the complete cleansing of the streets, as are\r\nstated by _Mr. Bland_, medical officer of the Macclesfield Union:—\r\n\r\n  “To show the value of police regulations in removing any improper\r\n  accumulations of foul, and putrid matter, where a deadly poison is\r\n  generated, I have a distinct recollection that, when the cholera\r\n  appeared in Macclesfield, not only was that fatal disease arrested\r\n  somewhat in its progress by the active vigilance exercised by the\r\n  gentlemen in seeing that in their several districts all offending\r\n  deposits were removed, and all pest-houses cleansed, that for several\r\n  months after the town had undergone this salutary inspection, and the\r\n  people made alive to the pernicious effects of the dunghill, fever of\r\n  the worst or contagious form scarcely appeared in the usual\r\n  localities, although it was at the autumnal season of the year. I\r\n  likewise noticed in spring-time following, when the filth had begun to\r\n  accumulate on the surface in certain parts of the town, a severe\r\n  return of contagious diseases, fever in all its stages, and a very\r\n  fatal epidemic small-pox.”\r\n\r\nSimilar cases were frequently noticed in the reports from Scotland; but\r\nwhen the alarm passed away, the habitual neglect of this description of\r\ncleanliness returned.\r\n\r\nIn the consideration of the evidence about to be submitted as to the\r\ncondition of the streets on the external condition of the residences of\r\nthe labouring classes, it should be borne in mind that the external\r\ncondition of the dwelling powerfully and immediately affects its\r\ninternal cleanliness and general economy.\r\n\r\nThe description of a large proportion of the streets inhabited by the\r\nworking classes in Manchester by Dr. Baron Howard, and those of Leeds by\r\nMr. Baker, those of Liverpool by Dr. Duncan, might be extended to\r\nGlasgow and other places. _Dr. Howard_ states:—\r\n\r\n  “That the filthy and disgraceful state of many of the streets in these\r\n  densely populated and neglected parts of the town where the indigent\r\n  poor chiefly reside cannot fail to exercise a most baneful influence\r\n  over their health is an inference which experience has fully proved to\r\n  be well founded; and no fact is better established than that a large\r\n  proportion of the causes of fever which occur in Manchester originate\r\n  in these situations. Of the 182 patients admitted into the temporary\r\n  fever hospital in Balloon-street, 135 at least came from unpaved or\r\n  otherwise filthy streets, or from confined and dirty courts and\r\n  alleys. Many of the streets in which cases of fever are common are so\r\n  deep in mire, or so full of hollows and heaps of refuse that the\r\n  vehicle used for conveying the patients to the House of Recovery often\r\n  cannot be driven along them, and the patients are obliged to be\r\n  carried to it from considerable distances. Whole streets in these\r\n  quarters are unpaved and without drains or main-sewers, are worn into\r\n  deep ruts and holes, in which water constantly stagnates, and are so\r\n  covered with refuse and excrementitious matter as to be almost\r\n  impassable from depth of mud, and intolerable from stench. In the\r\n  narrow lanes, confined courts and alleys, leading from these, similar\r\n  nuisances exist, if possible, to a still greater extent; and as\r\n  ventilation is here more obstructed, their effects are still more\r\n  pernicious. In many of these places are to be seen privies in the most\r\n  disgusting state of filth, open cesspools, obstructed drains, ditches\r\n  full of stagnant water, dunghills, pigsties, &c., from which the most\r\n  abominable odours are emitted. But dwellings perhaps are still more\r\n  insalubrious in those cottages situated at the backs of the houses\r\n  fronting the street, the only entrance to which is through some\r\n  nameless narrow passage, converted generally, as if by common consent,\r\n  into a receptacle for ordure and the most offensive kinds of filth.\r\n  The doors of these hovels very commonly open upon the uncovered\r\n  cesspool, which receives the contents of the privy belonging to the\r\n  front house, and all the refuse cast out from it, as if it had been\r\n  designedly contrived to render them as loathsome and unhealthy as\r\n  possible. Surrounded on all sides by high walls, no current of air can\r\n  gain access to disperse or dilute the noxious effluvia, or disturb the\r\n  reeking atmosphere of these areas. Where there happens to be less\r\n  crowding, and any ground remains unbuilt upon, it is generally\r\n  undrained, contains pools of stagnant water, and is made a depôt for\r\n  dunghills and all kinds of filth.”\r\n\r\nOf 687 streets, inspected by a voluntary association in that town, 248\r\nwere reported as being unpaved, 112 ill ventilated, 352 as containing\r\nstagnant pools, heaps of refuse, ordure, &c.\r\n\r\n  “The state of some of the streets and courts examined was found by\r\n  tile inspectors abominable beyond description, and exhibited a\r\n  melancholy picture of the filthy condition and unwholesome atmosphere\r\n  in which a large portion of our poor are doomed to live.\r\n\r\n  “As an example I will extract the description given of Little Ireland\r\n  from the proceedings of the Special Board of Health, which I have been\r\n  permitted to examine through the kindness of the borough-reeve, John\r\n  Brooks, Esq.:—\r\n\r\n  “‘The undersigned having been deputed by the Special Board of Health\r\n  to inquire into the state of Little Ireland, begs to report that, in\r\n  some of the streets and courts abutting, the sewers are all in a most\r\n  wretched state, and quite inadequate to carry off the surface water,\r\n  not to mention the slops thrown down by the inhabitants in about 200\r\n  houses. The privies are in a most disgraceful state, inaccessible from\r\n  filth, and too few for the accommodation of the number of people, the\r\n  average number being two to 250 people. The upper rooms are, with few\r\n  exceptions, very dirty, and the cellars much worse, all damp, and some\r\n  occasionally overflowed. The cellars consist of two rooms on a floor,\r\n  each nine or ten feet square, some inhabited by ten persons, others by\r\n  more; in many the people have no beds, and keep each other warm by\r\n  close stowage on shavings, straw, &c.; a change of linen or clothes is\r\n  an exception to the common practice. Many of the back-rooms, where\r\n  they sleep, have no other means of ventilation than from the front\r\n  rooms. Some of the cellars on the lower ground were once filled up as\r\n  uninhabitable, but one is now occupied by a weaver, and he has stopped\r\n  up the drain with clay to prevent the water flowing from it into his\r\n  cellar, and mops up the water every morning.’\r\n\r\n  “The above description represents as faithfully the present state of\r\n  this place as it did its condition eight years ago. In addition to the\r\n  circumstances here mentioned, the unhealthiness of this spot is\r\n  further increased by its low and damp situation, in a deep hollow,\r\n  bounded on one side by a filthy and stinking brook, which readily\r\n  overflows after rain; on another, by a very steep embankment; and on\r\n  another, by a high wall, which separates it from the gas-works, and\r\n  surrounded moreover by numerous high factories. * * *\r\n\r\n  “In the open space in the centre, which was formerly uncovered,\r\n  numerous pigsties are now erected, which add, if possible, to its\r\n  insalubrity. All the streets on the west side of the square are\r\n  blocked up at the end by a high wall, so that each forms a\r\n  _cul-de-sac_, a mode of construction which precludes the possibility\r\n  of effectual ventilation. Close to this wall, at the upper end of\r\n  these streets, are placed filthy and dilapidated privies, with large\r\n  open cesspools, which are frequently full to overflowing. The present\r\n  condition of those in Bent and James Leigh-streets are disgusting and\r\n  offensive beyond description.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Baker_ in his report on the sanitary condition of the residences of\r\nthe labouring classes in Leeds, thus describes their external\r\ncondition:—\r\n\r\n  “The river Aire, which courses about a mile and a half through the\r\n  town, is liable suddenly to overflow from violent or continued rains,\r\n  or from the sudden thawing of heavy falls of snow. The lower parts and\r\n  dwellings, both in its vicinity and in that of the becks, are not\r\n  unfrequently therefore inundated; and as the depth of the cellars is\r\n  below the means of drainage, the water has to be pumped out by\r\n  hand-pumps on to the surface of the streets. In those parts of the\r\n  town, and particularly where the humbler classes reside, during these\r\n  inundations, and where there are small sewers, the water rises through\r\n  them into the cellars, creating miasmatic exhalations, and leaving\r\n  offensive refuse, exceedingly prejudicial to the health as well as to\r\n  the comfort of the inhabitants. It was stated, on the authority of one\r\n  of the registrars, that during a season remarkable for an\r\n  unprecedented continuation of hot weather, that in one of these\r\n  localities, the deaths were as three to two, while in other parts of\r\n  the town, at the same period, they were as two to three. The condition\r\n  of the Timble Bridge beck is doubtless much worse for drainage\r\n  purposes than formerly, for the bottom has been raised by continual\r\n  deposits, until the oldest water-wheel upon it has had to be removed\r\n  as useless and inoperative; and stepping-stones, once the means of\r\n  passage over it, are at this moment said to be buried under the\r\n  accumulation of years, as much as one or two feet in depth. It is\r\n  quite clear, therefore, that that which was once the main receptacle\r\n  for the drainage of an entire district is, in its present state, no\r\n  longer capable of fulfilling that purpose; and that though a\r\n  considerable amount of drainage might still be effected by it, yet,\r\n  unless emptied of its superfluous matter, it cannot now be made\r\n  available for the wants of the entire population on its course.\r\n\r\n  “In an inundation about the period of 1838 or 1839, which happened in\r\n  the night, this beck overflowed its boundaries so greatly, and\r\n  regurgitated so powerfully into petty drains communicating with houses\r\n  100 yards distant from its line, that many of the inhabitants were\r\n  floated in their beds, and fever to a large amount occurred from the\r\n  damp and exhalations which it occasioned. Of the 586 streets of Leeds,\r\n  68 only are paved by the town, _i. e._, by the local authorities; the\r\n  remainder are either paved by owners, or are partly paved, or are\r\n  totally unpaved, with the surfaces broken in every direction, and\r\n  ashes and filth of every description accumulated upon many of them. In\r\n  the manufacturing towns of England, most of which have enlarged with\r\n  great rapidity, the additions have been made without regard to either\r\n  the personal comfort of the inhabitants or the necessities which\r\n  congregation requires. To build the largest number of cottages on the\r\n  smallest allowable space seems to have been the original view of the\r\n  speculators, and the having the houses up and tenanted, the _ne plus\r\n  ultra_ of their desires. Thus neighbourhoods have arisen in which\r\n  there is neither water nor out-offices, nor any conveniences for the\r\n  absolute domestic wants of the occupiers. But more than this, the land\r\n  has been disposed of in so many small lots, to petty proprietors, who\r\n  have subsequently built at pleasure, both as to outward form and\r\n  inward ideas, that the streets present all sorts of incongruities in\r\n  the architecture; causeways dangerous on account of steps, cellar\r\n  windows without protection, here and there posts and rails, and\r\n  everywhere clothes-lines intersecting them, by which repeated\r\n  accidents have been occasioned. During the collection of the\r\n  statistical information by the Town Council, many cases of broken legs\r\n  by these unprotected cellars, and of horsemen dismounted by neglected\r\n  clothes-lines hanging across the streets, were recorded.\r\n\r\n  “It might be imagined that at least the streets over which the town\r\n  surveyors have a legal right to exercise control would be sewered. But\r\n  this is not the case; of the 68 streets which they superintend, 19 are\r\n  not sewered at all, and 10 are only partly so; nay, it is only within\r\n  the three or four years past that a sewer has been completed through\r\n  the main street for two of the most populous wards of the town,\r\n  embracing together a population of 30,540 persons, by which to carry\r\n  off the surface and drainage water of an elevation of 150 feet, where,\r\n  indeed, there could be no excuse for want of sufficient fall. I have\r\n  seen, in the neighbourhood to which I now refer, an attempt made to\r\n  drain the cottage houses into a small drain passing under the\r\n  causeway, and which afterwards had to be continued through a small\r\n  sewer, and through private property, by a circuitous route, in order\r\n  to reach its natural outlet, and the water from the surveyors’ drain\r\n  regurgitate into the cutting from the dwellings. It only needs to be\r\n  pointed out that the sewer which has subsequently been made, and is\r\n  most effective, is an evidence of the previous practicability of a\r\n  work so essential to the welfare of the people; but, I may add, that\r\n  many of the inhabitants of districts a little further distant from the\r\n  town, where fever is always rife, are yet obliged to use cesspools\r\n  which are constructed under their very doors, for the want of the\r\n  continuation of this desirable measure.\r\n\r\n  “Along the line of these two wards, and down the street which divides\r\n  them, and where this sewer has been recently made, numbers of streets\r\n  have been formed and houses erected without pavement, and hence\r\n  without surface drainage—without sewers—or if under drainage can be\r\n  called sewers, then with such as, becoming choked in a few months, are\r\n  even worse than if they were altogether without. The surface of these\r\n  streets is considerably elevated by accumulated ashes and filth,\r\n  untouched by any scavenger; they form nuclei of disease exhaled from a\r\n  thousand sources. Here and there stagnant water, and channels so\r\n  offensive that they have been declared to be unbearable, lie under the\r\n  doorways of the uncomplaining poor; and privies so laden with ashes\r\n  and excrementitious matter as to be unuseable prevail, till the\r\n  streets themselves become offensive from deposits of this description;\r\n  in short, there is generally pervading these localities a want of the\r\n  common conveniences of life.\r\n\r\n  “The courts and _culs-de-sac_ exist everywhere. The building of houses\r\n  back to back occasions this in a great measure. It is in fact part of\r\n  the economy of buildings that are to pay a good per centage. In one\r\n  _cul-de-sac_, in the town of Leeds, there are 34 houses, and in\r\n  ordinary times, there dwell in these houses 340 persons, or ten to\r\n  every house; but as these houses are many of them receiving houses for\r\n  itinerant labourers, during the periods of hay-time and harvest and\r\n  the fairs, at least twice that number are then here congregated. The\r\n  name of this place is the Boot and Shoe-yard, in Kirkgate, a location\r\n  from whence the Commissioners removed, in the days of the cholera, 75\r\n  cart-loads of manure, which had been untouched for years, and where\r\n  there now exists a surface of human excrement of very considerable\r\n  extent, to which these impure and unventilated dwellings are\r\n  additionally exposed. This property is said to pay the best annual\r\n  interest of any cottage property in the borough.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Shaw_, the medical officer of the Hindley district of the Wigan\r\nunion, after giving a similar description of the streets of that town,\r\nadds:—\r\n\r\n  “The greater number of cases of fever in Tuce is in a great degree to\r\n  be accounted for from the extremely filthy state of those places where\r\n  it has been worst. Some of the cases were much worse than others,\r\n  several being of the malignant kind of typhus. Most of the cases\r\n  happened in Broom-street, in Tuce, a very uncleanly place, whole pools\r\n  of stagnant water, decayed animal and vegetable matter, and many other\r\n  nuisances of alike description lying in heaps from one end of the\r\n  street to the other. It is extremely probable a little attention to\r\n  these matters would save the inhabitants from many of the diseases\r\n  with which they are now continually affected.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. Waite_, in his report on the condition of the population at Lynn,\r\nstates:—\r\n\r\n  “I have seen typhus fever rage in families, where the refuse of a\r\n  market-gardener was suffered to accumulate in a hole, immediately\r\n  before three or four houses, whilst families at fifty yards distant\r\n  from it were perfectly free.”\r\n\r\nThe report by _Mr. Anderson_, solicitor, on the sanitary condition of\r\nInverness, exhibits the external features of the condition in which\r\nlarge proportions of the town population in Scotland are still allowed\r\nto remain in respect to all these defects:—\r\n\r\n  “From the very open or porous character of the subsoil, the grounds in\r\n  and around Inverness are seldom retentive of surface-water; and as\r\n  there is also a considerable inclination of the plain towards the\r\n  river, a good _drainage_ could be easily procured from almost every\r\n  part of the town. With the exception, however, of the principal\r\n  streets or thoroughfares, in which the best houses and shops are\r\n  situated, there are but few covered common sewers; and in the suburbs\r\n  generally, and from all the side alleys and closes, rain-water and\r\n  other accumulations pass away only by means of surface or open drains.\r\n  Hence among the dwellings of the poorer classes _stagnant pools_ very\r\n  frequently occur, and the drainage in these places, naturally bad\r\n  enough, is often purposely obstructed by the people, for the purpose\r\n  of adding to their _dunghill_ heaps or middens, which, as manure for\r\n  their potatoe-grounds, form the chief treasures of the poorer\r\n  cottagers and labourers. A gas and water company, established some\r\n  years ago, has afforded a great increase of comfort and cleanliness to\r\n  the buildings along the main thoroughfares; but to the back closes and\r\n  suburbs such _luxuries_ have not yet been extended, and hence the want\r\n  of order, decency, and comfort are painfully observable among them.\r\n  _Water-closets_ and _public privies_ are both rare, the consequences\r\n  of which, morally as well as physically, may be easily imagined, and\r\n  no doubt much infectious disease, if not occasioned, is harboured and\r\n  perpetuated by the want of them. The disgusting state of all the\r\n  bye-lanes and roads about Inverness proves what the people must suffer\r\n  on this account.\r\n\r\n  “As already stated, the dwellings of the humbler classes are in\r\n  general only _one_ story high, that is, they consist of a ground-floor\r\n  divided into two or three small apartments, with two or three\r\n  garret-rooms in the roof above, which is covered externally with turf\r\n  or straw thatch. Such buildings are often intermixed with houses of a\r\n  better description, and from being but seldom painted or whitewashed,\r\n  they have not a cheerful nor cleanly aspect. Most of them are provided\r\n  with small back courts or gardens, in which a few common vegetables\r\n  are grown; but their principal value is as stances for _pig-houses_\r\n  and dunghills, which in many instances are improperly allowed to rest\r\n  upon or touch the dwelling-houses; while it is not to be disguised\r\n  that cases exist where the _pig_, the _horse_, and the _cow_ all live\r\n  under the same roof with their owners, and the manure allowed to\r\n  accumulate there also. It is very common for a labourer’s _family_ to\r\n  have only a single apartment, or a room and a closet, while one room\r\n  is the usual accommodation rented by single persons, and that\r\n  frequently without a particle of ground attached.\r\n\r\n  “Amidst such a combination of unwholesome circumstances, it is rather\r\n  wonderful that malignant fever does not very greatly prevail in this\r\n  town. It is scarcely ever entirely free of it, and occasionally it\r\n  breaks out in some of its most contagious and dangerous forms, such as\r\n  measles, scarlet and typhus fever, and sometimes even small-pox,\r\n  spreading upwards among all classes of the community. The writer is\r\n  strongly inclined to believe that the comparative healthiness of\r\n  Inverness, notwithstanding its low and undrained position, is owing\r\n  chiefly to the salubrity of its climate, as influenced by its\r\n  situation, and the natural porousness of the soil.”\r\n\r\n_The Provost of Inverness_, at the time the report was made, gives the\r\nfollowing description of the town:—\r\n\r\n  “Inverness is a nice town, situated in a most beautiful country, and\r\n  with every facility for cleanliness and comfort. The people are,\r\n  generally speaking, a nice people, but their sufferance of nastiness\r\n  is past endurance. Contagious fever is seldom or ever absent; but for\r\n  many years it has seldom been rife in its pestiferous influence. The\r\n  people owe this more to the kindness of Almighty God than to any means\r\n  taken or observed for its prevention. There are very few houses in\r\n  town which can boast of either water-closet or privy, and only two or\r\n  three public privies in the better part of the place exist for the\r\n  great bulk of the inhabitants. Hence there is not a street, lane, or\r\n  approach to it that is not disgustingly defiled at all times, so much\r\n  so as to render the whole place an absolute nuisance. The _midden_ is\r\n  the chief object of the humble, and though enough of water for\r\n  purposes of cleanliness may be had by little trouble, still as the\r\n  ablutions are seldom, MUCH filth in-doors and out of doors _must_ be\r\n  their portion. When cholera prevailed in Inverness, it was more fatal\r\n  than in almost any other town of its population in Britain.”\r\n\r\nSuch is the absence of civic economy in some of our towns that their\r\ncondition in respect to cleanliness is almost as bad as that of an\r\nencamped horde, or an undisciplined soldiery. Mr. Baker applies to Leeds\r\nthe observations made by Sir John Pringle in his Treatise on the\r\nDiseases of the Army, but they are equally applicable to the districts\r\noccupied by the labouring classes wherever this inquiry has been\r\ncarried:—\r\n\r\n  “‘The chief cause of dysentery appears to be the foul straw and the\r\n  privies; for as soon as we had left that ground on which we had been\r\n  long encamped the sickness visibly abated.’ And again he says, ‘The\r\n  greatest source of dysenteric affections appears to be the privies.’\r\n  And again, speaking of bad air as producing epidemics, he systematizes\r\n  the mediate agent thus; ‘1st, Marsh effluvia; 2ndly, Encampment near\r\n  trees; 3rdly, The privies and foul straw of a camp; and 4thly, A pent,\r\n  corrupt, and vitiated atmosphere.’”\r\n\r\nThe discipline of the army has advanced beyond the civic economy of the\r\ntowns. In the standing orders given and enforced by the late General\r\nCrauford there are the following from Article 2, on the interior\r\nregimental arrangements on arriving in camp or quarters:—\r\n\r\n  “It must be explained to the men, as a standing order, that when no\r\n  regular necessaries are made, nor any particular spot pointed out for\r\n  easing themselves, they are to go to the rear, at least 200 yards,\r\n  beyond the sentries of the rear guard; all men disobeying this order\r\n  must be punished.\r\n\r\n  “The captain of the day and the quarter-master under the commanding\r\n  officers, are particularly responsible for the cleanliness of the camp\r\n  of each regiment; and the field officer of the inlying piquet, who is\r\n  charged with the superintendence of the police, and cleanliness of the\r\n  camp or quarters of the brigade, will give such orders upon the\r\n  subject as may be necessary to the captain of the day.”\r\n\r\nThe towns whose population never change their encampment, have no such\r\ncare, and whilst the houses, streets, courts, lanes, and streams, are\r\npolluted and rendered pestilential, the civic officers have generally\r\ncontented themselves with the most barbarous expedients, or sit still\r\namidst the pollution, with the resignation of Turkish fatalists, under\r\nthe supposed destiny of the prevalent ignorance, sloth, and filth.\r\n\r\nWhilst such neglects are visited by the scourge of a regularly recurring\r\npestilence and ravages of death more severe than a war, it may be\r\nconfidently stated that the exercise of attention, care, and industry,\r\ndirected by science in their removal, will not only be attended by\r\nexemptions from the pains of the visitation, but with exemptions from\r\npecuniary burdens, and with promise even of the profits of increased\r\nproduction to the community.\r\n\r\nThis will appear from an examination of the present mode of removing the\r\nrefuse from towns, and contrasting it with improved methods; and first\r\nwith relation to the refuse of the houses:—\r\n\r\nIt is proved that the present mode of retaining refuse in the house in\r\ncesspools and privies is injurious to the health and often extremely\r\ndangerous. The process of emptying them by hand labour, and removing the\r\ncontents by cartage, is very offensive, and often the occasion of\r\nserious accidents. But the expense of this mode operates, as the reports\r\nfrom the large towns show, as a complete barrier to all cleanliness in\r\nthis respect in the dwellings or streets occupied by the labouring\r\nclasses. The usual cost of cleansing cesspools of a tenement in London\r\nis about 1_l._ each time. With a population generally in debt at the end\r\nof the week, and whose rents are collected weekly, such an outlay may be\r\nconsidered as practically impossible, and the inferior landlords delay\r\nincurring the expense until the nuisance becomes unbearable. In London\r\nthe expense and annoyance of the cleansing of such places is avoided for\r\nyears, until they are in the condition described by _Mr. Howell_, one of\r\nthe council of the Society of Civil Engineers, who has acted extensively\r\nas a surveyor in the metropolis:—\r\n\r\n  “I would,” he states, “instance a recent case in my own parish, where\r\n  I was called to survey two houses about to undergo extensive repairs.\r\n  It was necessary that my survey should extend from the garrets to the\r\n  cellars: upon visiting the latter, I found the whole area of the\r\n  cellars of both houses were full of night-soil, to the depth of three\r\n  feet, which had been permitted for years to accumulate from the\r\n  overflow of the cesspools; upon being moved, the stench was\r\n  intolerable, and no doubt the neighbourhood must have been more or\r\n  less infected by it. I should mention, that these houses are letting\r\n  at from 30_l._ to 40_l._ a-year each, and are situated in a\r\n  considerable public thoroughfare.\r\n\r\n  “I would mention another case, amongst many more in St. Giles’s\r\n  parish: I was requested to survey the dilapidations to several houses\r\n  in the immediate neighbourhood of High-street, upon passing through\r\n  the passage of the first house, I found the yard covered with\r\n  night-soil, from the overflowing of the privy, to the depth of nearly\r\n  six inches, and bricks were placed to enable the inmates to get across\r\n  dry shod; in addition to this, there was an accumulation of filth\r\n  piled up against the walls, of the most objectionable nature; the\r\n  interior of the house partook something of the same character, and\r\n  discovering, upon examination, that the other houses were nearly\r\n  similar; I found a detailed survey impracticable, and was obliged to\r\n  content myself with making general observations. My duties, as one of\r\n  the surveyors to a fire-office, call me to all parts of the town, and\r\n  I am constantly shocked almost beyond endurance at the filth and\r\n  misery in which a large part of our population are permitted to drag\r\n  on a diseased and miserable existence. I consider a large portion, if\r\n  not the whole, of this accumulation of dirt and filth is caused by the\r\n  bad and inefficient sewerage of the metropolis. I am acquainted with\r\n  numberless houses in Westminster where the cellars are constantly\r\n  flooded, and having no drainage, the occupiers are obliged to pump out\r\n  the water, which, from being stagnant, is foul and offensive. If in\r\n  the performance of this necessary duty the matter becomes known, they\r\n  are summoned to the public office and fined 5_l._; however much,\r\n  therefore, the evil is felt in permitting the continuance of stagnant\r\n  water, the alternative of the fine for pumping out is worse; they\r\n  submit therefore to the lesser evil, and leave the water in the\r\n  cellars. * * *\r\n\r\n  “I am quite sure, from much observation, that the occupiers of houses\r\n  in all neighbourhoods are much influenced in their habits of\r\n  cleanliness by the facilities afforded for draining, and by the want\r\n  of carriage and foot-paving in the streets; and it is equally certain\r\n  that both health and life are frequently sacrificed by the constant\r\n  damps and unwholesome smell, occasioned entirely by the absence of all\r\n  means to carry off the impurities, which, in densely populated\r\n  neighbourhoods, increase with such fearful rapidity.”\r\n\r\nIt might have been expected, from the value of the refuse as manure (one\r\nof the most powerful known), that the great demand for it would have\r\nafforded a price which might have returned, in some degree, the expense\r\nand charge of cleansing. But this appears not to be the case in the\r\nmetropolis. It is stated that at present, with the exception of\r\ncoal-ashes, which are indispensable for making bricks, some description\r\nof lees, and a few other inconsiderable exceptions, no refuse in London\r\npays half the expense of removal by cartage. The cost of removal, or of\r\nthe labour and cartage, limits the general use or deposit of the refuse\r\nwithin a radius which does not exceed three miles beyond the line of the\r\ndistrict-post of the metropolis, that is, about six miles. It is stated\r\nthat, partly from the nature of the holdings, and from other\r\ncircumstances within this limited district, agricultural improvements\r\nare not so great as might be expected where the facilities are so easy\r\nfor obtaining any quantity of manure. Some idea may be formed of the\r\nloss of value of this manure from the metropolis, occasioned by the\r\nexpense of its collection and removal, from the evidence of a\r\nconsiderable contractor for scavengering, &c., who states, with respect\r\nto the most productive manure,—“I have given away thousands of loads of\r\nnight-soil: we knew not what to do with it.”[4]\r\n\r\nIn the parts of some towns adjacent to the rural districts the cesspools\r\nare emptied gratuitously for the sake of the manure; but they only do\r\nthis when there is a considerable accumulation, and any accumulation of\r\nany decomposing material which offends the smell is injurious to the\r\nhealth, especially in a town where all miasma is less diluted with fresh\r\nair, and where the population is less robust. For the saving of cartage,\r\nas well as the convenience of use, accumulations of refuse are\r\nfrequently allowed to remain and decompose and dry amidst the\r\nhabitations of the poorer classes. _Dr. Laurie_ in his report on the\r\nsanitary condition of Greenock, furnishes an example. He says,—\r\n\r\n  “The first question I generally put when a new case of fever is\r\n  admitted, is as to their locality. I was struck with the number of\r\n  admissions from Market-street; most of the cases coming from that\r\n  locality became quickly typhoid, and made slow recoveries. This is a\r\n  narrow back street; it is almost overhung by a steep hill, rising\r\n  immediately behind it; it contains the lowest description of houses,\r\n  built closely together, the access to the dwellings being through\r\n  filthy closes. The front entrance is generally the only outlet.\r\n  Numerous food for the production of miasma lies concealed in this\r\n  street. I think I could point out one in each close.\r\n\r\n  “In one part of the street there is a dunghill,—yet it is too large to\r\n  be called a dunghill. I do not misstate its size when I say it\r\n  contains a hundred cubic yards of impure filth, collected from all\r\n  parts of the town. It is never removed; it is the stock-in-trade of a\r\n  person who deals in dung; he retails it by cartfuls. To please his\r\n  customers, he always keeps a nucleus, as the older the filth is the\r\n  higher is the price. The proprietor has an extensive privy attached to\r\n  the concern. This collection is fronting the public street; it is\r\n  enclosed in front by a wall; the height of the wall is about 12 feet,\r\n  and the dung overtops it; the malarious moisture oozes through the\r\n  wall, and runs over the pavement. The effluvia all round about this\r\n  place in summer is horrible. There is a land of houses adjoining, four\r\n  stories in height, and in the summer each house swarms with myriads of\r\n  flies; every article of food and drink must be covered, otherwise, if\r\n  left exposed for a minute, the flies immediately attack it, and it is\r\n  rendered unfit for use, from the strong taste of the dunghill left by\r\n  the flies. But there is a still more extensive dunghill in this\r\n  street; at least, if not so high, it covers double the extent of\r\n  surface. What the depth is I cannot say. It is attached to the\r\n  slaughter-house, and belongs, I believe, to the town authorities. It\r\n  is not only the receptacle for the dung and offal from the\r\n  slaughter-house, but the sweepings of the streets are also conveyed\r\n  and deposited there; it has likewise a public privy attached. In the\r\n  slaughter-house itself, which is adjoining the street, the blood and\r\n  offal is allowed to lie a long time, and the smell in summer is highly\r\n  offensive. In two of the narrow closes opposite the market, there is\r\n  in each a small space not built upon, and that space, being the only\r\n  spare ground in the close, is occupied by a dunghill; these two closes\r\n  are notorious as nurseries for fever. I believe it to be a rare\r\n  occurrence when fever is not to be found in them during any time of\r\n  the year. Market-street is certainly one of the most filthy and\r\n  unhealthy streets in Greenock; it is needless to say that many places\r\n  here and there throughout the town are as bad, indeed, I may state\r\n  that from the best to the worst locality in the town there is not a\r\n  street but requires to be subjected to some rigid system for removing\r\n  away regularly the rubbish and impurities which are constantly\r\n  exhaling forth so much, and which is indirectly the cause of the\r\n  yearly increase of so much destitution.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Baker_, in his report, gives another instance of the ignorance and\r\ncarelessness under which the health of the population suffers.\r\n\r\n  “The contractor for the street sweepings, who is the treator with the\r\n  Commissioners of Public Nuisances in Leeds, last year rented a plot of\r\n  vacant land in the centre of the North-east ward, the largest ward in\r\n  point of population in the township of Leeds, and containing the\r\n  greatest number of poor, and this year rents, in the East ward,\r\n  another plot of land, as a depôt for the sweepings from the streets\r\n  and markets, both vegetable and general, for the purpose of\r\n  exsiccating and accumulating till they could be sold as manure and\r\n  carried away. So noisome were these exhalations, that the inhabitants\r\n  complained of their utter inability to ventilate their sleeping-rooms\r\n  during the day time, and of the insufferable stench to which both by\r\n  night and day they were thus subjected.”\r\n\r\nThe comparatively recent mode of cleansing adopted in the wealthy and\r\nnewly-built districts by the use of water-closets, and the discharge of\r\nall refuse at once from the house through the drain into the sewers,\r\nsaves the delay and the previous accumulation, and it also saves the\r\nexpense of the old means of removal. It is most applicable to the poorer\r\ndistricts, because really the most economical, when they are properly\r\nsewered and supplied with water. The cost of cheap and appropriate\r\napparatus, and of water for cleansing, it will be proved is a reduction\r\nof the mere cost of cleansing in the old method, independently of the\r\ncost incurred by the decay of woodwork and deterioration of the tenement\r\nwhich commonly takes place on premises in the condition of those\r\ndescribed by Mr. Howell. The chief objection to the extension of this\r\nsystem is the pollution of the water of the river into which the sewers\r\nare discharged. Admitting the expediency of avoiding the pollution, it\r\nis nevertheless proved to be an evil of almost inappreciable magnitude\r\nin comparison with the ill health occasioned by the constant retention\r\nof several hundred thousand accumulations of pollution in the most\r\ndensely-peopled districts.\r\n\r\nThere is much evidence, however, to prove that it is possible to remove\r\nthe refuse in such a mode as to avoid the pollution of the river, and at\r\nthe same time avoid the culpable waste of the most important manure.\r\n\r\nA practical example of the money value which lies in the refuse of a\r\ntown, when removed in the cheapest manner, and applied in the form best\r\nadapted to production, viz., by a system of cleansing by water, is\r\nafforded in connexion with the city of Edinburgh. In the course of the\r\nsanitary inquiry in that city the particular attention of Dr. Arnott and\r\nmyself was directed to the effects of some offensive irrigation of the\r\nland which had taken place in the immediate vicinity of that city. It\r\nappears that the contents of a large proportion of the sinks, drains,\r\nand privies of that city are conveyed in covered sewers to the eastern\r\nsuburb of the town, where they are emptied into a stream called the Foul\r\nBurn, which passes ultimately into the sea. The stream is thus made into\r\na large uncovered sewer or drain. Several years ago some of the\r\noccupiers of the land in the immediate vicinity of this stream diverted\r\nparts of it, and collected the soil which it contained in tanks for use\r\nas manure. After this practice had been adopted for a long period, the\r\nfarmers in the vicinity gradually found that the most beneficial mode of\r\napplying the manure was in the liquid form, and they conducted the\r\nstream over their meadows by irrigation. Others, perceiving the\r\nextraordinary fertility thus obtained, followed the example, and by\r\ndegrees about 300 acres of meadow, chiefly in the eastern parts of that\r\ncity, but all in its immediate vicinity, and the greater part of it in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the palace of Holyrood, have been systematically\r\nirrigated with the contents of this common sewer. From some of this land\r\nso irrigated, four or five crops a-year have been obtained; land once\r\nworth from 40_s._ to 50_s._ per acre now lets for very high sums. It is\r\nstated by a writer cited as an authority, on behalf of the parties\r\ninterested,—\r\n\r\n  “That the rent for which some of these meadows are let in small\r\n  portions to cow-feeders varies on an average from 20_l._ to 30_l._ per\r\n  acre. Some of the richest meadows were let in 1835 at 38_l._ per acre;\r\n  and in that season of scarce forage, 1826, 57_l._ per acre were\r\n  obtained for the same meadows. * * * The waste land called Figget\r\n  Whins, containing 30 acres, and 10 acres of poor sandy soil adjoining\r\n  them, were formed into water meadows in 1821, at an expense of\r\n  1000_l._ The pasture of the Figget Whins used to be let for 40_l._\r\n  a-year, and that of the 10 acres at 60_l._ Now the same ground as\r\n  meadows lets for 15_l._ or 20_l._ an acre a-year, and will probably\r\n  let for more, as the land becomes more and more enriched.”\r\n\r\nThis use of irrigation followed so gradually, that the time of its\r\ncommencement seems not accurately ascertained, but is known to have been\r\nusual near the beginning of the present century. The tanks are still to\r\na certain extent used. The irrigation proceeds from the beginning of\r\nApril to the middle of September, and, it is supposed that the deposits\r\nin the tanks are in the interval increased by the quantity of soil not\r\nemployed in irrigations.\r\n\r\nThe practice is strongly objected to by the inhabitants as an offensive\r\nand injurious nuisance. To Dr. Arnott, who surveyed the district, the\r\nprocess appeared to be, like most offensive processes, unfitted for the\r\nvicinity of a town. The miasma from the preparation of the large\r\naccumulations of manure in open receptacles near places of public resort\r\nor crowded habitations would probably affect the public health\r\ninjuriously to a greater or less degree. In particular states of the\r\nweather it could scarcely fail to engender disease. In the decomposition\r\nof substances for manure, deleterious gasses will be evolved, which in\r\nparticular states of the atmosphere will act with powerful effects on\r\nanimal life within their reach. But it is at the same time stated, the\r\nprocess of applying manure by irrigation, that is, separated and diluted\r\nwith water, is considered to be productive of less deleterious gas, of\r\nless injurious effects, than by spreading it over fields in a solid\r\nform, and allowing it to remain until it is decomposed and separated by\r\nthe atmosphere and conveyed into the soil by rain. Liebig, the greatest\r\nliving authority on agricultural chemistry, states that night-soil loses\r\nin drying half its valuable products, that is, half its “nitrogen,” for\r\nthe “ammonia” escapes into the atmosphere. By irrigation, by the\r\ndiffusion and conveyance of the manure to the plant in the medium of\r\nwater the escape of the valuable substance as a noxious and injurious\r\ngas is diminished.[5] Whatever extent of loss there is from manures by\r\ndecomposition when placed on the land in a solid form, and when exposed\r\nto the action of the atmosphere, it is stated that there is\r\nproportionate gain by holding the material in suspension in water. The\r\nsimple offensiveness, it may be assumed, is a sufficient ground of\r\nexclusion of any process from amidst the habitations of a town\r\npopulation. But at a reasonable distance the use of dung or any other\r\nmanure would not be forbidden; and the process which is the least\r\ninjurious, the irrigative, is entitled therefore to a preference.\r\nEffective drainage must make way for the conveyance of diluted manures,\r\nand consequently for effective irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe continuance of the practice in Edinburgh of the use of the common\r\nsewer for irrigation is defended by the occupiers and owners, on the\r\nground that from the time of its commencement, when it was unopposed,\r\nand, as it appears to us, escaped any notice, a legal right has been\r\nacquired by them in the manure of the city contained in the Burn, and\r\nthe present claimants of the right contend that they are entitled to\r\ncompensation under the Scotch law for any diversion of the stream or of\r\nthe manure which it contains. The irrigation which has surrounded the\r\npalace of Holyrood having, as it is considered, rendered it prejudicial\r\nto health, Her Majesty’s government, for the protection of this palace\r\nas a royal residence, have directed legal process for the trial of the\r\nright claimed to the irrigation. The defendants vindicate the measure on\r\nthe ground of its utility as an agricultural operation, and treat the\r\nproposal to divert the contents of the sewers as being in fact a\r\nproposal to deprive the city of the milk and butter yielded by more than\r\n3000 milch cows, and the markets of the meat from their carcases; that,\r\nin fact, “the grass, which in virtue of irrigation these meadows\r\nproduce, supports in Edinburgh 3300 cows, and in Leith 600 cows, during\r\nthe season.”[6] We were informed that the parties interested in the\r\nlands estimate the compensation that would induce them to discontinue\r\nthe practice at 150,000_l._; and a pamphlet written at their instance,\r\nin 1840, states this as the sum which the proprietors of the meadows to\r\nthe west of the city would be legally entitled to (independently of the\r\nclaims of those in the east) were the practice abolished by legislative\r\nauthority. The proprietors have had, on several occasions, sufficient\r\ninfluence to frustrate the efforts of the city authorities, to obtain\r\nlegislative sanction for the removal of the nuisance, and for a more\r\nsalubrious disposal of it for the advantage of the inhabitants\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe public refuse of cities by the usual course of legislation in local\r\nActs, and by custom, and on all principles which govern the application\r\nof the proceeds of such produce belongs to the public, and it may be\r\nsubmitted that, whatever may be the decision in the case of Edinburgh,\r\nmeans should be taken to prevent for the future the acquisition of new\r\nrights at the expense of the health and of the conveniences of such\r\nlarge classes of the population. And it may here be observed that it\r\nwill probably be found, under the circumstances of the increasing\r\npopulation of the towns, and the increasing necessity of keeping open\r\nspaces within and around the towns, and of exercising a general control\r\nfor the beneficial arrangement of new buildings for the public health\r\nand convenience, and of securing convenient public walks and places of\r\ntemperate and healthful recreation for the population—that it is most\r\ndesirable for all these objects that means should be taken to redeem to\r\nthe crown the fee, or otherwise obtain as early as practicable, and on\r\nthe terms of proper compensation, lands within and in the immediate\r\nvicinity of towns for public use.\r\n\r\nIf then, in Edinburgh, the contents of the cesspools were carried by\r\nadequate supplies of water in drains from the houses into covered\r\nsewers, and thence in covered instead of open sewers to the lands at\r\nproper distances where it might be distributed as manure by irrigation,\r\nit would be a mode of irrigation considered by Mr. Smith of Deanston,\r\nand other authorities on drainage and irrigation, whom I consulted, the\r\nbest that is now apparently practicable, _i. e._, the best means for\r\nremoving quickly, and constantly, and the least injuriously, the matters\r\nwhich can only remain for removal by any other process at the expense of\r\nthe public health; they concur in opinion that it would also be the most\r\nproductive mode of distributing the manure.\r\n\r\nOn the scale of the value set upon that portion of the refuse of\r\nEdinburgh that has been appropriated for irrigation by the occupiers of\r\nthe land in the vicinity of the city, the value of the whole of the soil\r\nof the city (not one-third of which finds its way into the irrigated\r\nmeadows), if it were made completely available by an appropriate system\r\nof town drainage, would be double or treble the amount, producing an\r\nincome of 15,000_l._ to 20,000_l._ per annum for public purposes. On the\r\nsame scale of value it would appear that, in the metropolis, refuse to\r\nthe value of nearly double what is now paid for the water of the\r\nmetropolis is thrown away, partly from the districts which are sewered\r\ninto the Thames, and partly from the poor districts which are unsewered,\r\nwhere it accumulates and remains a nuisance until it is removed at a\r\ngreat expense. It is allowed by Captain Vetch, an experienced engineer,\r\nand by other authorities, to be the most eligible plan in respect to\r\neconomy as well as efficiency, wherever the levels were not convenient,\r\nor it were desirable to send the refuse over heights for distribution,\r\nthat the contents of the sewers should be lifted by steam power, as\r\nwater is lifted in the drainage of the fens, and that it might be sent\r\nfor distribution, wherever it is required for use, in iron pipes, in the\r\nsame mode as that in which water is conveyed into towns by the water\r\ncompanies. The estimated expense of this mode of cleansing and removal\r\nis about the same as the conveyance of water into towns, _i. e._, not a\r\ntithe of the expense of cartage, as will subsequently be shown.\r\n\r\nThe comparative economy of conveyance of fluid in pipes has been but\r\nlittle observed, and has only recently perhaps been applied for the\r\npurpose of cleansing. The following is an instance of the application of\r\nthe principle:—A contract was about to be entered into by the West\r\nMiddlesex Water Company for hauling out from their reservoir at\r\nKensington the deposit of eight or ten years’ silt, which had\r\naccumulated to the depth of three or four feet. The contractor offered\r\nto remove this quantity, which covered nearly an acre of surface, for\r\nthe sum of 400_l._, in three or four weeks. The reservoir was emptied in\r\norder to be inspected by the engineer and directors before the contract\r\nwas accepted. It occurred to one of the officers that the cleansing\r\nmight be accomplished more readily by merely stirring up the silt, to\r\nmix it with the water; and then if a cut or outlet were made in the\r\nmain-pipe used for conveying the water to London, that it might be\r\nwashed out. He accordingly got thirty or forty men to work in stirring\r\nup the deposit, and accomplished the work at the cost of 40_l._ or\r\n50_l._ and three or four days’ labour, instead of so many weeks; when\r\nthe directors went to see the basin, to decide upon the contract, the\r\nreservoir was as free from any deposit as a house-floor. Since the\r\ndiscovery thus made, the silt has been regularly cleansed out into the\r\ncommon sewers. It is to be observed, in respect to the relative\r\ncheapness of the two modes, that the contractor would only have removed\r\nthe silt to the nearest convenient place of deposit in the immediate\r\nvicinity of the reservoir, whereas, in the fluid state, it might be\r\ncarried at the actual cost of conveying water, as far as it is at\r\npresent conveyed, and sold with a profit, 12 or 14 miles, and raised to\r\nheights of 150 feet, at 2½_d._ per ton.\r\n\r\nBy the application of capital and machinery, the cost of conveyance of\r\nsubstances in suspension in a fluid, even at the water companies’\r\nprices, may be rendered thirty and even more than forty times as cheap\r\nas collection by hand labour and removal by cartage. In the metropolis,\r\nwhere the persons who water the roads may obtain water gratuitously from\r\npumps, the water supplied by stand-pipes by some of the water companies\r\nat 1_l._ per 100 tons, is found to be twice as cheap as the mere labour\r\nof pumping the water into the cart. By proper hydraulic arrangements\r\nheavy solid substances may be swept away through the iron pipes.\r\n\r\nThese means which science gives of cheapening the cost of the conveyance\r\nof refuse from houses, will be available also in extending and\r\ncompleting the cleansing of the towns, of removing the filth which\r\noppresses the poorer districts, and rendering the whole of it available,\r\nin the best form, for future use as manure.\r\n\r\nThe expense of cleansing the streets of the _township_ of Manchester is\r\n5,000_l._ per annum. For this sum the first class of streets, namely,\r\nthe most opulent and the large thoroughfares, are cleansed once a-week,\r\nthe second class once a-fortnight, and the third class once a-month. But\r\nthis provision leaves untouched, or leaves in the condition described in\r\nDr. Baron Howard’s report, the courts, alleys, and places where the\r\npoorest classes live, and where the cleansing should be daily. There are\r\nabundance of recommendations to the effect, “Let it be ordered that the\r\nstreets be properly cleansed;” but in this instance the cost of\r\ncleansing the whole of what is properly the same town, Salford, and the\r\nout-townships, would be 8,000_l._ or 10,000_l._ per annum; and such a\r\nrecommendation, under the existing modes of management, is equivalent to\r\nsaying, let 20,000_l._ or 30,000_l._ of additional rates be expended,\r\nand 40,000 or 60,000 additional loads of refuse be removed. In other\r\nlarge towns, the service and the expense is on a similar scale. At the\r\nrate of expense of one large parish, the present cost of cleansing in\r\nthe metropolis may be estimated at about 40,000_l._ per annum. This\r\nexpense, however, is generally repaid by the sale of the coal-ashes,\r\nwhich are used in the manufacture of bricks.\r\n\r\nThough the refuse of the poorer districts is often taken and sold, the\r\nimmediate objection to the extension of the services of the scavenger to\r\nthem is the increase of the immediate expense, which it is practically\r\nnecessary to consider in detail, although if there were no compensation\r\nby the sale of any coal-ashes or house refuse, and if the occupants were\r\nrequired to pay for the cleansing at the rate of one of the opulent\r\nparishes in the metropolis, that is at the rate of 4_s._ per house per\r\nannum, which would be less than a penny per tenement for the weekly\r\nstreet cleansing; or in the poorer districts, where there are mostly two\r\nfamilies to a tenement, a charge of less than one halfpenny per week for\r\ncleansing, would be found to be good economy, as one means of\r\ndiminishing the existing heavy charge of sickness, not to speak of the\r\nwear and tear of clothes.\r\n\r\nTwo-thirds of the usual expense of street cleansing is the expense of\r\ncartage, which, with a proper adaptation of the sewers, is wholly\r\nunnecessary. The exclusive use of hand-labour in street-sweeping is\r\npronounced by competent judges to be a mere barbarism, and several\r\nmachines have been invented which demonstrate that by mechanical power,\r\nmoved by horses, the cleansing may be effected in a far shorter time.\r\nSome of these scrape the mud in ridges to the sides, where it remains\r\nuntil it can be lifted and carted away. But this is objected to as\r\ninconvenient by the shopkeepers, and the scavengers object that it is no\r\nconvenience to them, inasmuch as raking it in heaps prevents the\r\nevaporation of the liquid, and increases the cartage; and, moreover,\r\nthat the process of sweeping by hand is as quick as the carts can return\r\nfor its removal. A machine has been used at Manchester which rapidly and\r\ncleanly sweeps the level surfaces of the streets into a cart; but there\r\nis still the encumberance of the labour, and cost and delay of carting\r\nthe refuse to a place of deposit, which may be several miles distant,\r\nand returning to reload. The value of a process of street-cleansing is\r\nproportioned to the rapidity with which it is performed, but at present\r\nit is usually delayed until the sun or the air has done a large portion\r\nof the work by the evaporation of the moisture, commonly however to the\r\ndeterioration of the air of the town and the health, and also to the\r\ndeterioration of the value of the refuse.\r\n\r\nOn examining these obstructions to the cleanliness and salubrity of our\r\ntowns, it became apparent that the expensive and slow process of the\r\nremoval of the surface refuse of the streets by cartage might be\r\ndispensed with, and the whole at once carried away by the mode which is\r\nproved, in the case of the refuse of houses, to be the most rapid,\r\ncheap, and convenient, namely, by sweeping it at once into the sewers,\r\nand discharging it by water.\r\n\r\nThe sewerage of the metropolis, though it is a frequent subject of boast\r\nto those who have not examined its operations or effects, will be found\r\nto be a vast monument of defective administration, of lavish\r\nexpenditure, and extremely defective execution. The general defect of\r\nthese works is, that they are so constructed as to accumulate deposits\r\nwithin them; that the accumulations remain for years, and are at last\r\nonly removed at a great expense, and in an offensive manner, by\r\nhand-labour and cartage. The effect is to generate and retain in large\r\nquantities before the houses the gases which it is the object of\r\ncleansing to remove. In the course of the present inquiry instances have\r\nbeen frequently presented of fevers and deaths occasioned by the escapes\r\nof gas from the sewers into the streets and houses. In the evidence\r\ngiven before the Committee of the House of Commons, which received\r\nevidence on the subject in 1834, one medical witness stated, that of all\r\ncases of severe typhus that he had seen, eight-tenths were either in\r\nhouses of which the drains from the sewers were untrapped, or which,\r\nbeing trapped, were situated opposite gully-holes; and he mentioned\r\ninstances where servants sleeping in the lower rooms of houses were\r\ninvariably attacked with fever. It was proposed as a remedy to prevent\r\nthe escape of the noxious effluvia by trapping them, but this was\r\nrefused on the ground of the danger to the men, who must enter the\r\nsewers to clean them, from the confined gas. In one of the circulars the\r\nreason assigned for allowing the escape of the gas into the streets is\r\nthat if it were confined in the sewers it might impede the flow of the\r\nwater. It was then proposed to allow the escape of the noxious gases\r\nthrough chimneys constructed at certain distances. But this was decided\r\nto be an experiment, and the Committee did not feel themselves\r\nauthorized to make experiments. Instances were adduced where it had been\r\nfound necessary either to trap or to remove gully-holes in the vicinity\r\nof butchers’ shops, to avoid the injurious effects of the effluvium upon\r\nthe meat. Similarly mischievous effects of the defective construction\r\nand management of the sewers are commonly displayed in the medical\r\nreports from the provincial towns, and they have been incidentally\r\nnoticed in the passages already cited.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned as another instance of the absence of appropriate\r\nknowledge that has governed these structural arrangements, that a large\r\nproportion of the most expensive sewers are constructed with flat\r\nbottoms. In proportion as the water is spread the flow is impeded, and\r\nthe deposit of matter it may hold in suspension increased. Mr. Roe, a\r\ncivil engineer, who, much to the honour of the Holborn and Finsbury\r\ndistrict of sewers, has been appointed to the care of their sewers, and\r\nis perhaps the only officer having the experience and qualifications of\r\na civil engineer, states, that as compared with sewers or drains with\r\nbottoms of a semicircular form, those with flat bottoms invariably\r\noccasion a larger amount of deposit; and with the same flow of water,\r\nthe difference of construction occasions a difference of more than\r\none-half in the deposit which is left. By the common and most expensive\r\nform, the drains are apt to be choked up with noxious accumulations; by\r\nbeing built with flat sides (instead of with curved sides, which give\r\nthe strength of an arch) they are apt in clayey and slippery ground to\r\nbe forced in. The expense of the improved form is nearly one-fourth less\r\nthan those in general use. _Mr. Roe_, whose evidence, which is\r\ncorroborated by the evidence of other engineers, is given in the\r\nAppendix, was asked,—\r\n\r\n  In respect to the levels, how have you found the sewers?—They appear\r\n  to have been entirely constructed with reference to the locality, to\r\n  drain to the nearest outlet, and not on an extended view for the whole\r\n  district, or with any view to sewerage on a large scale. In the\r\n  Holborn and Finsbury divisions the Commissioners now adopt a series of\r\n  levels suited from the lowest outlets to the surrounding districts.\r\n\r\n  Have you heard of any alterations made in the surrounding districts on\r\n  the same principle?—I have heard of none as adopted generally. The\r\n  City have lowered several of their outlets; and the chairman of the\r\n  Westminster Commission has had the subject under consideration for\r\n  some time.\r\n\r\n  What are the chief effects of the piecemeal town drainage without\r\n  reference to extended levels?—Chiefly that when new lines of houses\r\n  are built and require new sewers, either the old sewers must be taken\r\n  up and re-constructed at a great expense, to adjust them to a new and\r\n  effective sewerage, or the new sewers, if they are adjusted to the old\r\n  ones, are deficient in fall, and they have greater deposits.\r\n\r\n  Does the existing form or system of sewerage answer fully and at the\r\n  least expense the chief objects of sewerage in house and street\r\n  cleansing, and the removal of noxious substances?—No, it does not,\r\n  except where the outlets have been lowered, and the sewers continued\r\n  at a proper level; great accumulations of deposit are occasioned in\r\n  the sewers, and from their containing the refuse that was at one time\r\n  deposited in the cesspools, the deposit is more noxious than formerly;\r\n  the gas is more considerable, it escapes more extensively into streets\r\n  and into the houses, where the drains are not well trapped. My opinion\r\n  is that the general health of the men who work and have been\r\n  accustomed to the sewers, has become still worse; they are more pale\r\n  and thin, and lower in general health than formerly. The effect of the\r\n  noxious gases upon men working in these places is to lower the general\r\n  health. Since I have had the superintendence of the sewers, the men\r\n  have encountered about half a dozen accidents by explosions of gas.\r\n\r\n  But is the health of these men who work in the sewers to be taken as a\r\n  criterion of the health of persons who are not accustomed to such\r\n  places?—I have had no means of forming a comparison, though I am of\r\n  opinion that gases which they encounter without any immediate injury\r\n  would be very injurious to the health of susceptible persons, or of\r\n  any persons not habituated to it.\r\n\r\n  The first prejudicial effect of the defective system, then, is to\r\n  occasion these noxious accumulations; how are they removed?—Formerly,\r\n  in the Holborn and Finsbury sewers, and at present, I believe, in all\r\n  other sewers, the streets were opened at a great expense and\r\n  obstruction (they are so now, I believe, elsewhere); men descend,\r\n  scoop up the deposit into pails, which are raised by a windlass to the\r\n  surface, and laid there until the carts come; it is laid there until\r\n  it is carted away, sometimes for several hours, to the public\r\n  annoyance and prejudice. The contract price for removal from the old\r\n  sewers without man-holes was 11_s._ per cubic yard of slop removed;\r\n  where they have man-holes it was 6_s._ 10_d._ per cubic yard. This\r\n  practice also involves injury and expense as respects the pavement; a\r\n  street may be well paved when it is broken up for the cleansing of the\r\n  sewers, but the portions of pavements so disturbed are never so well\r\n  put down again; neither can accidents be effectually guarded against.\r\n\r\n  By what means may these effects be obviated?—In the Holborn and\r\n  Finsbury divisions I suggested a plan of flushing the sewers, and of\r\n  carrying off all the refuse by water. This plan has been adopted, and\r\n  it is now in operation. The breaking up of the streets is avoided by\r\n  the formation of side entrances; cast-iron flushing gates are fixed in\r\n  the sewers; the ordinary flow of water in the sewers accumulates at\r\n  these gates; the gates are opened, and the force of the water is\r\n  sufficient to sweep off the deposit; and the system may be further\r\n  extended.\r\n\r\n  What is the comparative difference in the expense of construction?—The\r\n  cost of side entrances and flood-gates, as compared with the cost of\r\n  man-holes, is from 6_d._ to 1_s._ less per foot lineal of the length\r\n  of new sewers.\r\n\r\n  What other expense is attendant on this improved practice?—The main\r\n  expense is the attendance of a man to shut and open the flood-gates.\r\n\r\n  The structural expense being lower, is the ultimate expense of\r\n  cleansing lower also?—Yes; the expense of cleansing the sewers is\r\n  about 50 per cent. less than the prevalent mode. Our expense of\r\n  cleansing the sewers was about 1,200_l._ per annum; we save 600_l._ of\r\n  that, and expect to save more; but to this must be added the saving to\r\n  the public of the cleansing of the private drains, formerly choked by\r\n  the accumulations in the sewers. This saving, on a moderate\r\n  calculation, is found to be upwards of 300_l._ per annum. There is\r\n  also the diminution of the escapes of gas from the old and continued\r\n  accumulations.\r\n\r\n  During what intervals are deposits allowed to remain on the old\r\n  mode?—The average is in one set of sewers about five years, and in\r\n  another about ten years.\r\n\r\n  During which time the public are subjected to all the escapes of gas\r\n  from the decomposing accumulation?—Exactly so. It could not, however\r\n  go on so long but for heavy falls of rain or snow, which occasion\r\n  partial clearances.\r\n\r\n  What is the effect of these accumulations upon the private\r\n  drainage?—That the drains to the private houses are stopped: the first\r\n  intimation of the foul state of the main sewer arises from complaints\r\n  of individuals whose drains are affected; the accumulations in the\r\n  private drains also occasions an expense to the individuals and much\r\n  annoyance. By flushing the sewers this expense might be, and in\r\n  Holborn and Finsbury division it is, avoided.\r\n\r\n  Are there any other defects you have, as an engineer, noticed in the\r\n  prevalent mode of constructing the sewers?—Yes, the prevalent practice\r\n  is to join sewers at angles, frequently at right angles; this\r\n  occasions eddies and deposits of sediment that would otherwise pass\r\n  off with the water; it injures the capacity of the main sewers by\r\n  obstructing the current of water along them: I ascertained by\r\n  experiment that the time occupied in the passage of an equal quantity\r\n  of water, along similar lengths of sewer with equal falls, was—\r\n\r\n                                              Seconds.\r\n                  Along a straight line             90\r\n                  With a true curve                100\r\n                  With a turn at right angles      140\r\n\r\n  The Commissioners of the Holborn and Finsbury divisions agreed to\r\n  require that the curves in sewers, passing from one street to another,\r\n  shall be formed with a radius of not less than 20 feet; it is also\r\n  required that the inclination or fall shall be increased at the\r\n  junction, in order to preserve an equal capacity for the passage of\r\n  water, and of effect in sweeping away the deposit.\r\n\r\n  When by heavy falls of snow or otherwise the refuse of the streets is\r\n  carried into such sewers, is there any difficulty in sweeping it\r\n  away?—None whatsoever.\r\n\r\n  In what number of years would the saving in cleansing sewers by\r\n  flushing repay the expense of applying the apparatus to the existing\r\n  sewers in the Holborn and Finsbury divisions?—In seven years.\r\n\r\n  Have you any doubt of the practicability of carrying all the surface\r\n  cleansing of the streets into the sewers, and removing it by\r\n  conveyance in water, instead of by hand labour and cartage?—I\r\n  entertain no doubt whatever that it might be done, where there is a\r\n  good sewer and proper gully-holes and shoots; with a good supply of\r\n  water these would carry away rapidly all the surface refuse; the\r\n  experience of the sewerage in the Holborn and Finsbury divisions prove\r\n  it.\r\n\r\n  How does it prove it?—At every opportunity the street-sweepers sweep\r\n  all they can into the gully-holes, and it is swept away without\r\n  inconvenience.\r\n\r\n  One practical witness states that the expense of the cartage alone of\r\n  the refuse from a Macadamised street of half a mile, in the winter\r\n  time in the metropolis, is 5_l._ weekly. What would be the comparative\r\n  expense of carrying it away by the sewers?—It would save the whole\r\n  expense of the cartage; it would be less than the present expense of\r\n  sweeping and filling into the carts, and if there were a sufficient\r\n  supply of water on the surface, the work might be conducted with great\r\n  rapidity.\r\n\r\n  You are aware that one inconvenience of the existing mode of street\r\n  cleansing, independently of the great expense, is the length of time\r\n  during which the wet refuse remains to the public annoyance on the\r\n  surface, until removed by the slow process of sweeping and\r\n  cartage?—Yes; and the men would appear to delay for the purpose of the\r\n  dirt being removed, by being washed by rain into the sewers.\r\n\r\n  Do you conceive that all the business of street cleansing and house\r\n  draining might be consolidated advantageously to the public?—Yes,\r\n  clearly so, and with great economy.\r\n\r\nIn the evidence of Mr. Oldfield, an experienced builder in the wealthy\r\ndistricts of the metropolis, will be found exemplifications of the\r\nmischiefs resulting from the defective modes of opening sub-drains or\r\ncommunications, even from houses of the first class, into the main\r\ndrains.[7] The state of sewerage and drainage in the larger towns, as\r\ndescribed in the medical reports, in its effects of frequent disease and\r\ndeath,—is much worse in the provincial towns. But every step in\r\nimprovement is an advance in reduction of existing burdens; drainage,\r\n_per se_, will be found to be a reduction of an existing charge for the\r\nexpenses of sickness and mortality; _science_, applied to the\r\nimprovement of drainage, not only gives it efficiency, but reduces\r\ngreatly the expense.\r\n\r\nThe streets in the larger towns commonly display, from the want of\r\nscience in their construction, similar waste, and equally admit of an\r\nimproved and scientific arrangement, which will conduce to economy and\r\nto improved public health.\r\n\r\nThe bad condition of the streets in many of the towns is very generally\r\nascribable to pavement being commonly regarded as requisite solely for\r\ncart or carriage conveyance, and not as a means of cleanliness. The\r\npavement has therefore been usually confined to the chief streets in\r\nwhich the carriage traffic is considerable. Some of the principal\r\nstreets even in the metropolis almost justify the description of being\r\n“streams of mud and filth in winter,” and “seas of dust” in summer. But\r\nattention has of late been directed to the cleansing of the road as a\r\nmeans of removing damp and dirt or dust, which are each found to be\r\ninjurious. So far as various experiments have yet proceeded in the\r\nmetropolis, they are stated to be highly favourable to the use of wood\r\nas a substance for paving the streets, though perhaps in forms different\r\nfrom those at present in use, with improvements which further experience\r\nwill suggest. Wood, when pinned together and laid on a firm substratum,\r\nappears to be less retentive of wet than most forms of stone pavement,\r\nand to possess very considerable advantages over the Macadamised roads\r\nfor crowded thoroughfares. If it be brought into general use it will\r\nhave an advantage in removing the granite dust, which medical\r\nauthorities believe to be much more prejudicial to health, in exciting\r\nor aggravating lung diseases, than the public have been aware of. Where\r\nthere is much dust in the working of close quarries, the effects of it\r\nare almost as destructive to the lungs of the operatives as the\r\nknife-grinding to the operatives of Sheffield who do not guard against\r\nthe steel-dust. “It is scarcely conceivable,” Dr. Arnott states, “that\r\nthe immense quantities of granite-dust pounded by one or two hundred\r\nthousand pairs of wheels working on Macadamised streets, should not\r\ngreatly injure the public health. In houses bordering such streets or\r\nroads, it is found that, notwithstanding the practice of watering, the\r\nfurniture is often covered with dust even more than once in the day, so\r\nthat writing on it with the finger becomes legible, and the lungs and\r\nair-tubes of the inhabitants, with a moist lining to detain the dust,\r\nare constantly pumping the same atmosphere. The passengers by a\r\nstage-coach in dry weather, when the wind is moving with them so as to\r\nkeep them enveloped in the cloud of dust raised by the horses’ feet and\r\nthe wheels of the coach, have their clothes soon saturated to whiteness\r\nwith the dust, and their lungs of course are charged in a corresponding\r\ndegree. A gentleman who rode only 20 miles in this way, had afterwards\r\nto cough and expectorate for 10 days to clear his chest again.” The\r\nimperfection of road cleansing in paved streets at the same time\r\ndeteriorates the salubrity of the towns, the value of the refuse for\r\nproduction, and the streets themselves. The farmers find that the refuse\r\nof the streets, of which horse-dung and other excrementitious substances\r\nform so important a part, is valuable in proportion as it is “fresh.” On\r\na proposition to sweep the streets of a town district oftener, it was\r\nstated by some farmers that they would, in that case, give more for the\r\nrefuse. It is with this description of refuse, as stated with respect to\r\nthe night-soil, in proportion as it is allowed to remain in the streets\r\nto dry, it loses the gas which gives it value; and the gas which is lost\r\nfrequently gives to streets the offensive smell perceptible to strangers\r\nwho have not been familiarised to it, and makes a deleterious addition\r\nto the compounds by which the health of the town population is injured.\r\nThe complete and rapid cleansing of the roads has also its effects on\r\nthe draught. It is proved experimentally that, “calling the draught on a\r\nbroken-stone road 5, that on the same road covered with dust is 8, and\r\nthat on the same road wet and muddy is 10.”[8] A road should be cleansed\r\n“from time to time, so as never to have half an inch of mud upon it.\r\nThis is particularly necessary to be attended to where the materials are\r\nweak, for if the surface is not kept clean, so as to admit of its\r\nbecoming dry in the intervals between showers of rain, it will be\r\nrapidly worn away.” With the even surface obtainable from the use of\r\nwood as a pavement, it is stated that the streets which are now kept wet\r\nand dirty whilst the process of cleansing is slowly carried on by the\r\nhand, may be rapidly and cheaply swept by sweeping-machines drawn by\r\nhorses. With the advantage of such a system of sewerage as that\r\ndescribed by Mr. Roe, the surface refuse, which continues exposed during\r\na whole week, may be removed every morning before the hours of traffic\r\nfrom all the principal thoroughfares. In the main streets of the towns\r\nof considerable traffic, a smooth and firm surface for the carriage-way\r\nwould ensure the advantages of a railroad, in addition to those to the\r\npublic health from cleanliness. The experience on several portions of\r\nsmooth road shows that single horses with lighter and less expensive\r\nvehicles would suffice where two horses are now required on the common\r\nroads; where strong stone pavements are required to resist the shock of\r\nheavy vehicles, and heavy vehicles propelled with double power to resist\r\nthe battering of strong pavements, and the grinding and wear and tear of\r\nheavy and dirty roads.\r\n\r\n_Captain Vetch_, the engineer, who is extensively acquainted with the\r\nstructural economy of towns, observes in a communication on the subject,\r\nthat—\r\n\r\n  “The other mode of avoiding the formation of mud is the substitution\r\n  of wooden pavements; of the success of these I have little doubt,\r\n  though for the present many failures have occurred, either from the\r\n  foundation not having been truly and firmly laid, or from the blocks\r\n  of wood not being massive enough. The greatest objection to wood\r\n  pavements at present is the slipping of the horses, but this I believe\r\n  might be obviated. The question, however, at present is to get rid of\r\n  the street dirt, such as it is; and for that purpose I concur in\r\n  opinion it would only be necessary in wet weather during rains that\r\n  the street-cleaner should sweep the dirt into the kennels, and aid the\r\n  water by stirring the mud, to carry off the material in a state of\r\n  diffusion; in dry weather, the opening of pipes with hose attached\r\n  would serve the same purpose as the rains, and at the same time aid\r\n  the sewerage at the time most required. After a short but heavy fall\r\n  of rain, the cleansing effect of the water is fully perceived: and if\r\n  any means could be devised of saving the rain-water that falls on the\r\n  houses and in the streets, so as to apply it in considerable\r\n  quantities at intervals, it is probable that the rain-water would be\r\n  amply sufficient for all the purposes in question.”\r\n\r\nMr. Roe states, that arrangements were made with the water companies for\r\nsupplies of water for the cleansing of the sewers in the Holborn and\r\nFinsbury district, but it was found that the ordinary supplies to the\r\nsewers sufficed, and those from the company were not used.\r\n\r\nThe cleansing of the streets and the removal of the impurities from the\r\nhabitations appears to have been the subject of considerable attention\r\nat Paris of late years. An individual proposed to the administration of\r\nthat city a mode of cleansing the streets and pavement, by sweeping all\r\nthe refuse into the sewers which are discharged into the Seine, that had\r\nhitherto been daily gathered into heaps and carted away beyond the\r\nprecincts. The minister of police thought it advisable to take the\r\nopinion of the Institute on the proposal. The superiority of the\r\nproposed mode of street cleansing was admitted, but the members of the\r\nInstitute, to whom the subject was referred, having ascertained the\r\nquantity of rubbish which was daily collected in Paris, and also the\r\nquantity of water which flowed in the Seine during the summer-time, they\r\nfound that this volume of water was 9600 times greater than the greatest\r\nquantity of filth and rubbish collected in the same length of time from\r\nthe streets of Paris; and they reported as their conclusion, “that the\r\nquantity of dirt which would be thrown into the Seine, compared with the\r\nvolume of water in the river, would be found to be so extremely small as\r\nto be absolutely inappreciable; that it was not from the consideration\r\ntherefore of insalubrity that the project for cleaning the streets as\r\nproposed should be negatived, but solely because by that means there\r\nwould be lost a quantity of most valuable manure, which was quite\r\nindispensable to the agriculture around Paris, and consequently to Paris\r\nitself.”[9]\r\n\r\nMr. Roe has furnished me with a calculation made from the flow of water\r\nin the Thames, at a neap tide: taking the ebb, and comparing it with the\r\nquantity of deposit in the water running from the sewers from the whole\r\nof the metropolis (assuming that the sewerage bears the same proportion\r\nas the Holborn and Finsbury division), that the proportion of impurities\r\nto the volume of water of the Thames is as 1 to 10,100. If the surface\r\ncleansing of the streets were added to the ordinary mass of impurity, he\r\ncalculates that the proportion held in suspension would then be about 1\r\nto 5069. To this must be added the impurities from land-floods, and\r\nthose from vessels in the river. The amount of impurity discharged from\r\nthe sewers was calculated from the amount of deposit known to have been\r\nformed in several of them. The amount of impurity in the Thames would\r\ntherefore be, at the least, double the amount of that calculated for the\r\nSeine.[10]\r\n\r\nIf the evils of the pollution of such a stream were much greater, they\r\nwould still be found inconsiderable as compared with the perpetual\r\npollution of the air by the retention of ordures and refuse amidst large\r\nmasses of the population. What has been stated as to the practicability\r\nof extending threefold the cleansing of towns, by dispensing with\r\ncartage, and using the sewers for the removal of the refuse of the\r\nstreets, is stated as an advantage, even on the supposition that no use\r\nis made of the refuse, and that it is entirely thrown away. But it were\r\na reproach to stop at the advance to this far lesser evil, and to add to\r\nthe pollution of the streams of the towns, which throughout the country\r\nform the chief common sewers, by throwing into them everything that is\r\nvile in the towns, i. e. everything that is most valuable for increasing\r\nthe surrounding fertility.\r\n\r\nOn a full examination of the evidence adduced and of the evidence\r\nindicated, it will, I trust, be found to be satisfactorily established;\r\nthat the houses of towns may be constantly and rapidly cleansed of\r\nnoxious refuse by adaptation of drains and public sewers; and that with\r\nsuch an adaptation, for one street or one district cleansed at the\r\npresent expense three may be cleansed by the proposed mode; that the\r\nnatural streams flowing near towns may be preserved from the pollution\r\ncaused by the influx of the contents of the public sewers, by the\r\nconveyance of all refuse through covered pipes, and that the existing\r\ncost of conveyance, by which its use for production is restricted, may\r\nbe reduced to less than one-fortieth or fiftieth of the present expense\r\nof removal by hand labour and cartage;[11] that these bounties on\r\ncleanliness and salubrity on the one hand, and beneficial production on\r\nthe other, are dependent on skilful and appropriate administrative\r\narrangements. But for the attainment of these objects, and the relief of\r\nthe worst-conditioned districts, another provision appears to be\r\nrequisite, namely, appropriate\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Supplies of Water._\r\n\r\nBesides those reports from towns in which a large proportion of their\r\nsalubrity is attributed to a natural drainage, from the porosity of the\r\nsoil, or from the undulations of the surface being favourable to the\r\ndischarge of moisture, as at Birmingham, other reports ascribe a large\r\nproportion of the comparative health of the population to advantageous\r\ncircumstances, in respect to the supplies of water. From such\r\ninformation as that already cited, it will be manifest that for an\r\nefficient system of house cleansing and sewerage, it is indispensable\r\nthat proper supplies of pure water should be provided, and be laid on in\r\nthe houses in towns of every size, and, it might be added, in all\r\nconsiderable rural villages. No previous investigations had led me to\r\nconceive the great extent to which the labouring classes are subjected\r\nto privations, not only of water for the purpose of ablution, house\r\ncleansing, and sewerage, but of wholesome water for drinking, and\r\nculinary purposes.\r\n\r\n_Mr. John Liddle_, one of the medical officers of the Whitechapel union,\r\nafter describing the deplorable condition of the dwellings of the\r\nlabouring population in that part of London, states, that—\r\n\r\n  “In connexion with this state of things is the deficiency of water\r\n  which is not laid on in any of their houses.\r\n\r\n  “How do they get such water as they use?—They get it for the most part\r\n  from a plug in the courts. I cannot say whether it is the actual\r\n  scarcity of water, or their reluctance to fetch it, but the effect is\r\n  a scarcity of water. When I have occasion to visit their rooms, I find\r\n  they have only a very scanty supply of water in their tubs. When they\r\n  are washing, the smell of the dirt mixed with the soap is the most\r\n  offensive of all the smells I have to encounter. They merely pass\r\n  dirty linen through very dirty water. The smell of the linen itself,\r\n  when so washed, is very offensive, and must have an injurious effect\r\n  on the health of the occupants. The filth of their dwellings is\r\n  excessive, so is their personal filth. When they attend my surgery, I\r\n  am always obliged to have the door open. When I am coming down stairs\r\n  from the parlour, I know at the distance of a flight of stairs whether\r\n  there are any poor patients in the surgery. Any one who attends on the\r\n  relief days of the out-door relief may satisfy himself as to the\r\n  personal condition of these parties.\r\n\r\n  “Are the courts in which the labouring classes reside, in your\r\n  district, paved or cleansed?—They are not flagged, they have a sort of\r\n  pebbles; they are always wet and dirty. The people, having no\r\n  convenience in their houses for getting rid of waste water, throw it\r\n  down at the doors. If I cast my eye over the whole district at this\r\n  moment, I do not think that one house for the working classes will be\r\n  found in which there is such a thing as a sink for getting rid of the\r\n  water.\r\n\r\n  “Then there is not such a thing as a house with the water laid on?—Not\r\n  one in the poorer places. There is also the want of cesspools; there\r\n  is only one or two places for a whole court, and soil lies about the\r\n  places which are in a most offensive condition.\r\n\r\n  “What is the number of cases which you visit for the administration of\r\n  medical relief during the year?—During the last year the number of\r\n  cases was 1560, all of them out-patients.\r\n\r\n  “Has not a large sewer been recently formed through your\r\n  district?—Yes, through Rosemary-lane.\r\n\r\n  “What has been its effect?—Very little as respects the inhabitants of\r\n  the courts; the landlords are not compelled, and do not go to the\r\n  expense of making any communication from the courts to the sewer; the\r\n  courts are in as wet and dirty and in as bad a condition as ever.\r\n\r\n  “What are the rents paid for these descriptions of tenements?—I am\r\n  informed, very high rents. I am informed that this description of\r\n  property pays a better per centage than any other description of\r\n  property.—My impression is that it pays as much as 20 per cent. in\r\n  many instances.”\r\n\r\nThis evidence exhibits the common condition of large masses of\r\nhabitations, even in the metropolis, where there are so many competing\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mott_ states that, in Manchester,—\r\n\r\n  “There are numerous pumps and a plentiful supply of water within a few\r\n  feet of the surface, to say nothing of the various tanks and cisterns\r\n  in factories and private dwellings, which in this proverbially rainy\r\n  district are always abundantly supplied; but, from the nature of the\r\n  atmosphere, the rain-water is frequently like ink. The Irwell and\r\n  Medlock rivers run through the town of Manchester; but being\r\n  receptacles for all kinds of filth and refuse, the water is too impure\r\n  for general use. In the suburbs of Manchester the water is generally\r\n  procured through the medium of rain-water cisterns, or from very\r\n  shallow wells by pumps. In the better class of houses it is generally\r\n  filtered, but the poorer classes use it without any preparation. The\r\n  custom is for owners of small cottage property to erect a pump for the\r\n  use of a given number of houses; this pump is frequently rented by one\r\n  of the tenants, who keeps it locked, and each of the other tenants are\r\n  taxed a certain sum per month for the use of it. One poor woman told\r\n  me she paid 1_s._ per month. The water company give a plentiful supply\r\n  to small houses at 6_s._ per year, or about half what this woman paid\r\n  for a precarious supply from the subscription pump. The Stockport\r\n  Local Act empowers the commissioners of that town to _compel_ the\r\n  cottage owners to provide a good supply of water to their tenants.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. John Moyle_, medical officer of the Truro union, states—\r\n\r\n  “But few houses are properly supplied with water. In very dry seasons,\r\n  they have to fetch water from a distance varying from a quarter to 1½\r\n  mile.”\r\n\r\nThis is at present the condition of a large proportion of the houses in\r\nHampstead, Highgate, and Hendon, where water is purchased by the\r\npailful.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Daniel Antrobus_, medical officer of the Audley district, Newcastle\r\nunion, Staffordshire, says—\r\n\r\n  “They have seldom a good supply of water, are without _pumps_, and the\r\n  occupants are obliged to obtain it from stagnant reservoirs or impure\r\n  springs, situate often at a considerable distance.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Henry Cribb_, the medical officer of the Dunmow union reports, as a\r\ncircumstance which is highly injurious to the health,—\r\n\r\n  “The want of good and wholesome spring-water: there being scarcely any\r\n  pumps for the use of the poor, they are compelled to use water\r\n  collected from ditches; and I have known it frequently to be not only\r\n  very impure, but almost in a putrid state.”\r\n\r\nThe medical officer of the Bishop’s Stortford union, states—\r\n\r\n  “I am of opinion that, in this and most of the rural parishes,\r\n  complaints often arise from the want of good and wholesome\r\n  spring-water, there being very few pumps, or even wells, and the poor\r\n  being compelled to use water collected from ditches and other impure\r\n  sources; this circumstance, connected with the very imperfect\r\n  drainage, I think requires strict investigation.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Whilpels_, the medical officer of the Lexden and Winstree union,\r\nstates—\r\n\r\n  “There is a point I deem most worthy of notice, I allude to the\r\n  deficiency of spring-water. The inhabitants of Salcot Virley and Great\r\n  Wigborough are compelled to drink pond-water, which is impure,\r\n  brackish, and most injurious to the constitution. The few who have the\r\n  means, send for water a distance of four miles; to obviate this evil\r\n  would be a blessing conferred upon the great mass of the population\r\n  residing in these parishes.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. William Blower_, surgeon of Bedford, states,—\r\n\r\n  “At Wootton (near Bedford) the labourers are very numerous, and before\r\n  the passing the Poor Law Amendment Act the greater part of them were\r\n  dependent for support upon the poor-rates. The land was enclosed and\r\n  undrained, employment was scanty, and wages were very low; the water\r\n  was very bad, the inhabitants being principally supplied from pits dug\r\n  near their houses, and filled by rain in the winter, which in the\r\n  summer, and particularly in dry seasons, were almost emptied by use\r\n  and evaporation, leaving only a muddy fluid covered with a green scum,\r\n  and loaded with aquatic animals and plants. Sporadic typhus prevailed\r\n  extensively in the summer and autumn, and ague in the winter and\r\n  spring.\r\n\r\n  “Since the introduction of the New Poor Law and the enclosure of the\r\n  land, considerable draining has been effected, employment has been\r\n  more plentiful, and the wages higher, and many of the labourers have\r\n  allotments of ground. Typhus has been rapidly diminishing, and this\r\n  year (1839) there was no case until November, and then only two. This\r\n  must principally be attributed to the improved state of the parish,\r\n  and partly, perhaps, this year, to the wetness of the season, by which\r\n  the water-pits have been kept nearly full, so that the conditions\r\n  favourable to the generation of malaria have not existed.\r\n\r\n  “A few wells have been dug lately, and good water has been obtained,\r\n  and there is every probability if the water-pits were filled up, and\r\n  more wells dug, and the draining completed, that sporadic typhus and\r\n  ague, which have so long infested this village, and occasioned so much\r\n  distress and expense, might be entirely eradicated. A respectable\r\n  farmer informed me that, in the neighbouring parish of Houghton, a few\r\n  years ago, his was the only family that used well-water, and almost\r\n  the only one that escaped ague.”\r\n\r\nThe state of the supplies of water to the labouring classes in Scotland\r\nappears to be similar to that prevalent in the towns and the rural\r\ndistricts of England.\r\n\r\n_Mr. William Tait_, surgeon, of Edinburgh, states, in regard to the\r\nhouses in the High-street, Cowgate, and Canongate:—\r\n\r\n  “The dwellings of the poor are remarkable for their generally\r\n  uncomfortable appearance, and I attribute this in most instances to a\r\n  deficient supply of water, necessaries, and such like conveniences.\r\n  There are no receptacles for filth of any description, and it is\r\n  either accumulated in the stairs or dwellings themselves, and the\r\n  stairs are scarcely ever washed. And how can it be otherwise, seeing\r\n  that the poor have to travel for a considerable distance for water,\r\n  and afterwards carry it up five, six, or seven stories?”\r\n\r\nThe Return from Glasgow states that the—\r\n\r\n  “Sewers or drains are left uncovered, and with no diluting water\r\n  except the refuse of families and rain-water.”\r\n\r\nThat—\r\n\r\n  “There is no scarcity of water if carried into the poorer houses.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. Alexander Cuddie_, of Aberdeen, states that the—\r\n\r\n  “Water is plentiful; but it would be proper to bring it into the\r\n  houses of the poor as well as the rich.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Forrest_, in his report on the sanitary condition of the population\r\nof Stirling, states that in that town—\r\n\r\n  “The supply of water is often very deficient. There is no\r\n  water-company, and the water is not conveyed into the houses even of\r\n  the wealthy inhabitants. In times of scarcity it is no uncommon\r\n  occurrence to see from 80 to 100 persons waiting at each public well\r\n  for water; and the scarcity of it is often made an excuse by servants\r\n  for the neglect of domestic duties. I may therefore with propriety\r\n  say, that the poor of Stirling are often not properly supplied with\r\n  water for the purposes stated in the query.”\r\n\r\nThe _Rev. George Lewis_, the minister of St. David’s parish, Dundee, in\r\nspeaking of drainage, says that—\r\n\r\n  “Everything in this way is done very imperfectly; drains and sewers\r\n  are insufficient, and run into the mill-pond.”\r\n\r\nThat there is—\r\n\r\n  “No water, except what is purchased or taken out of the filthy\r\n  mill-pond.”\r\n\r\nAnother informant states—\r\n\r\n  “The west and south-west suburbs are destitute of water, and have no\r\n  sewers; the north and east suburbs are also badly supplied with water,\r\n  and have no drains. Indeed there are only two drains in the town that\r\n  I know of, and I should think them rather hurtful than otherwise, as\r\n  there is not water enough to scour them out.”\r\n\r\nIn answer to the question, whether the residences of the population\r\namidst which contagious febrile diseases arise are properly supplied\r\nwith water for the purposes of cleanliness of the houses, person, and\r\nclothing? _Dr. John Macintyre_, of Greenock, states that—\r\n\r\n  “Their proprietors or landlords, with a few exceptions, have not\r\n  properly supplied them with water, although an ample supply of that\r\n  necessary aid to cleanliness can be cheaply obtained by means of pipes\r\n  from the Shaws’ Water Company.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. James Sym_ states that—\r\n\r\n  “There are few wells of good water in Ayr. The water in general is\r\n  strongly impregnated with lime, and the supply is defective. Strangers\r\n  find it unpleasant, and I believe horses which have not been used with\r\n  it are apt to suffer when it is given them to drink.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. A. Cochrane_ and _Mr. W. J. Thomson_, surgeons, of Arbroath, state—\r\n\r\n  “That the town is well supplied with _hard_ water, but that an\r\n  abundant supply of soft water might be brought into the town with very\r\n  little expense from a spring in the neighbourhood.”\r\n\r\nThe Return from Renfrew states that—\r\n\r\n  “A plentiful supply of water may be had from the street wells, and\r\n  also from a burn which runs close to the town.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. Henry Douglas_, of Dunfermline, says—\r\n\r\n  “They are _very inadequately_ supplied with water for these purposes.”\r\n\r\nThe return from Kirkwall, states—\r\n\r\n  “That water is supplied at public wells: there is no scarcity of\r\n  water, but it is somewhat hard.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. W. B. Ross_, of Tain, in reply to the question whether the town is\r\nproperly supplied with water? says—\r\n\r\n  “By no means; the water is very hard, and unfit for most domestic\r\n  purposes.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. S. Scott Alison_, in his Report on the sanatory condition of the\r\ntown of Tranent, furnishes an exemplification of the condition of many\r\nof the smaller towns:—\r\n\r\n  “I do not believe there is a house in Tranent into which water is\r\n  conducted by pipes. There existed great difficulty on many occasions\r\n  in getting water at all. During the seven years I lived there, the\r\n  village was, on the whole, extremely ill supplied with water: it was\r\n  usual for it to be occasionally absent from Tranent altogether. Last\r\n  summer the supply of water was stopped for several months. The\r\n  inhabitants suffered the greatest inconvenience from this cause; they\r\n  could not get sufficient water to maintain cleanliness of person and\r\n  clothes; it was even difficult for labouring people to get enough to\r\n  cook their victuals; and I know that many of the poor were, in\r\n  consequence, reduced to the practice of using impure and unwholesome\r\n  water. On these occasions water was carried from a considerable\r\n  distance from the village. Some went the distance of a mile; some used\r\n  barrels drawn on carriages; some employed children to bring it in\r\n  small vessels; and, I doubt not, many went without it, when it was\r\n  highly necessary, from inability or infirmity to go themselves, and\r\n  from want of funds to employ another for the purpose. Since the above\r\n  was written I have learned from a lady, previously resident in\r\n  Tranent, that, when cholera prevailed in that district, some of the\r\n  patients suffered very much indeed from want of water, and that so\r\n  great was the privation, that on that calamitous occasion people went\r\n  into the ploughed fields and gathered the rain water which collected\r\n  in depressions in the ground, and actually in the prints made by\r\n  horses’ feet. Tranent was formerly well supplied with water of\r\n  excellent quality by a spring above the village, which flows through a\r\n  sand-bed. The water flows into Tranent at its head, or highest\r\n  quarter, and is received into about 10 wells, distributed throughout\r\n  the village. The people supply themselves at these wells when they\r\n  contain water. When the supply is small, the water pours in a very\r\n  small stream only; and it happens, in consequence, that on these\r\n  occasions of scarcity great crowds of women and children assemble at\r\n  these places, waiting their ‘turn,’ as it is termed. I have seen women\r\n  fighting for water. The wells are sometimes frequented throughout the\r\n  whole night. It was generally believed by the population that this\r\n  stoppage of the water was owing to its stream being diverted into a\r\n  coal-pit which was sunk in the sand-bed above Tranent. That pit has\r\n  been lined with sheets of iron, and the water has lately returned to\r\n  Tranent in great abundance.”\r\n\r\nThe observations made by _Mr. Burton_, in his Report, appear to be\r\ndeserving of attentive consideration. He states—\r\n\r\n  “I have reason to believe that in many parts of Scotland the want of a\r\n  good supply of water is one of the most material impediments to the\r\n  furtherance of cleanly habits among the working people. Besides the\r\n  immediate evils of a narrow supply, much time is wasted, and many bad\r\n  habits are acquired by those who have to wait their turn at the wells\r\n  in a time of drought. Dundee, Stirling, Dunfermline, Lanark, and\r\n  Arbroath, are all, I believe, imperfectly supplied. The community of\r\n  Dundee have spent about 30,000_l._ in a contest between the supporters\r\n  of two contending water-bills; and I understand that an Act which was\r\n  passed about three years ago has been found incapable of being put in\r\n  operation. The evil is rendered more serious by the demand for cooling\r\n  water for the numerous steam-engines, and the article is so precious\r\n  that it is for these purposes repeatedly re-cooled by exposure and\r\n  evaporation after it has been heated. I believe that in many of the\r\n  colliery and manufacturing districts there is inconvenience, amounting\r\n  to suffering, from want of water. Where there is a positive deficiency\r\n  of the element on the spot, the means of procuring a supply from\r\n  another place are so various and so dependent on local circumstances,\r\n  that nothing but some arbitrary authority, possessed of sufficient\r\n  funds, could ensure its being obtained in every instance.”\r\n\r\nOn these and various reports from the medical officers and others in\r\nEngland, as well as from Scotland, in which it is stated in terms\r\nsimilar to the return from Renfrew, “that a plentiful supply of water\r\n_may_ be had from the street wells, and also from a burn which runs\r\nclose to the town,” it is to be observed, that the economy of a town, or\r\nof any considerable collection of habitations, appears to be essentially\r\ndefective, insofar as it leaves a large proportion of the inhabitants\r\ndependent on such a mode of supply.\r\n\r\nSupplies of water obtained from wells by the labour of fetching and\r\ncarrying it in buckets or vessels do not answer the purpose of regular\r\nsupplies of water brought into the house without such labour, and kept\r\nready in cisterns for the various purposes of cleanliness. The\r\ninterposition of the labour of going out and bringing home water from a\r\ndistance acts as an obstacle to the formation of better habits; and I\r\ndeem it an important principle to be borne in mind, that in the actual\r\ncondition of the lower classes, conveniences of this description must\r\nprecede and form the habits. It is in vain to expect of the great\r\nmajority of them that the disposition, still less the habits, will\r\nprecede or anticipate and create the conveniences. Even with persons of\r\na higher condition, the habits are greatly dependent on the\r\nconveniences, and it is observed, that when the supplies of water into\r\nthe houses of persons of the middle class are cut off by the pipes being\r\nfrozen, and when it is necessary to send for water to a distance, the\r\nhouse-cleansings and washings are diminished by the inconvenience; and\r\nevery presumption is afforded that if it were at all times requisite for\r\nthem to send to a distance for water, and in all weathers, their habits\r\nof household cleanliness would be deteriorated. In Paris and other towns\r\nwhere the middle classes have not the advantage of supplies of water\r\nbrought into the houses, the general habits of household and personal\r\ncleanliness are inferior to those of the inhabitants of towns who do\r\nenjoy the advantage. The whole family of the labouring man in the\r\nmanufacturing towns rise early, before daylight in winter time, to go to\r\ntheir work; they toil hard, and they return to their homes late at\r\nnight. It is a serious inconvenience, as well as discomfort to them to\r\nhave to fetch water at a distance out of doors from the pump or the\r\nriver on every occasion that it may be wanted, whether it may be in\r\ncold, in rain, or in snow. The minor comforts of cleanliness are of\r\ncourse forgone, to avoid the immediate and greater discomforts of having\r\nto fetch the water. In general it has appeared in the course of the\r\npresent inquiry that the state of the conveniences gives, at the same\r\ntime, a very fair indication of the state of the habits of the\r\npopulation, in respect to household, and even personal cleanliness. The\r\n_Rev. Whitwell Elwin_, the chaplain of the Bath union, gives the\r\nfollowing illustration of the habits of many of the working population\r\neven in that city, which is well supplied with water:—\r\n\r\n  “A man had to fetch water from one of the public pumps in Bath, the\r\n  distance from his house being about a quarter of a mile,—‘It is as\r\n  valuable,’ he said, ‘as strong beer. We can’t use it for cooking, or\r\n  anything of that sort, but only for drinking and tea.’ ‘Then where do\r\n  you get water for cooking and washing?’—‘Why, from the river. But it\r\n  is muddy, and often stinks bad, because all the filth is carried\r\n  there.’ ‘Do you then prefer to cook your victuals in water which is\r\n  muddy and stinks to walking a quarter of a mile to fetch it from the\r\n  pump?’—‘We can’t help ourselves, you know. We could not go all that\r\n  way for it.’ There are many gentlemen’s houses in the same district in\r\n  which the water is not fit for cooking; and I know that much privation\r\n  and inconvenience is undergone to avoid the expense of water-carriage.\r\n  I have often wondered to see the shifts which have been endured rather\r\n  than be at the cost of an extra pail of water, of which the price was\r\n  three halfpence. With the poor, far less obstacles are an absolute\r\n  barrier, because no privation is felt by them so little as that of\r\n  cleanliness. The propensity to dirt is so strong, the steps so few and\r\n  easy, that nothing but the utmost facilities for water can act as a\r\n  counterpoise; and such is the love of uncleanliness, when once\r\n  contracted, that no habit, not even drunkenness, is so difficult to\r\n  eradicate.”\r\n\r\nIn most towns, and certainly in the larger manufacturing towns, those\r\nmembers of a family who are of strength to fetch water are usually of\r\nstrength to be employed in profitable industry, and the mere value of\r\ntheir time expended in the labour of fetching water, is almost always\r\nmuch higher than the cost of regular supplies of water even at the\r\ncharge made by the water companies. In Glasgow the charge for supplying\r\na labourer’s tenement is 5_s._ per annum; in Manchester 6s. In London\r\nthe usual charge is 10_s._ for a tenement containing two families, for\r\nwhich sum two tons and a half of water per week may be obtained if\r\nneeded. For 5_s._ per annum, then, as a water-rate (on which from 10 to\r\n20 per cent. is paid to the owner for collection), each labourer’s\r\nfamily may be supplied in the metropolis with one ton and a quarter of\r\nwater weekly, if they find it necessary to use so much. The ton is 216\r\ngallons, equal to 108 pails full, at two gallons the pail. Thus for less\r\nthan one penny farthing, 135 pails full of water are taken into the\r\nhouse without the labour of fetching, without spilling or disturbance,\r\nand placed in constant readiness for use. Under any circumstances, if\r\nthe labourer or his wife or child would otherwise be employed, even in\r\nthe lowest-paid labour or in knitting stockings, the cost of fetching\r\nwater by hand is extravagantly high as compared with the highest cost of\r\nwater lifted by steam and conducted through iron pipes at a large\r\nexpenditure of capital (the lowest in London is about 200,000_l._) and\r\nby an expensive management. In illustration of the difference in economy\r\nof the two modes of conveyance, I may mention that the usual cost of\r\nfiltered water carried into the houses at Paris by the water-carriers,\r\nis two sous the pailful, being at the rate of 9_s._ per ton; whilst the\r\nhighest charge of any of the companies in London for sending the same\r\nquantity of water to any place within the range of their pipes, and\r\ndelivering it at an average level of 100 feet, at the highest charge, is\r\n6_d._ per ton.\r\n\r\nAt the highest of the water companies’ charges it would be good economy\r\nfor the health of the labourer’s family to pay for water being laid on\r\nin the house, to reduce the expense of medicines and loss of work in the\r\nfamily, as indicated by any of the tables of sickness. The cost of\r\nlaying on the water in a labourer’s tenement, and providing a butt or\r\nreceptacle to hold it, may be stated to be on an average 40_s._, which\r\nwill last twenty years.\r\n\r\nThe experience of the water companies tends to show that the\r\ndistribution of water directly into the houses where it is wanted, would\r\nbe good economy of the water. When the supply of water into the houses\r\nis stopped by frost, and cocks are, on that occasion, opened in the\r\nstreets, the supply of water required is one-third greater than usual;\r\nas great, indeed, as it is in the heat of summer, when there is a large\r\nadditional consumption for watering gardens and roads. I would here\r\nsuggest that it is essential that the water should be charged on the\r\nowners of all the smaller weekly tenements, because, where the owner\r\nfinds it necessary to collect the rent weekly, the smaller collection of\r\nrates for longer periods would often be impracticable, and the expense\r\nof the collection alone of such small rates weekly (1¼_d._ per week)\r\nwould be more than the amount collected.\r\n\r\nThe mode of supplying water by private companies for the sake of a\r\nprofit is not however available for the supply of a population, where\r\nthe numbers are too small to defray the expense of obtaining a private\r\nAct of parliament, or the expense of management by a board of directors,\r\nor to produce profits to shareholders; it is, therefore, a mode not\r\navailable to the population of the country who do not reside in the\r\nchief towns. The Poor Law Commissioners have been urgently requested to\r\nallow the expense for procuring supplies for villages to be defrayed out\r\nof the poor’s rates in England, but they could only express their regret\r\nthat the law gave them no power to allow such a mode of obtaining the\r\nbenefit sought. The mode of supply by private companies is, however, the\r\nsubject of complaint in the populous towns, where it is the only mode.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is little probability that regular supplies of water\r\nwould ever have been obtained without the inducement of salaries to the\r\nmanagers and of returns of interest to the capitalists; although the\r\ncost of most of the supplies at the highest is much lower than the\r\nlabour of fetching water from a pump close to the house, and no valid\r\nobjection appears against compulsory provisions for water being laid on\r\n(_i. e._ for existing charges of labour being reduced) in the tenements\r\nof the labouring classes in towns, at the common charge of the water\r\ncompanies: still the appearance of a profit and of dividends on the\r\nsupply of a natural commodity does, in the new districts at least,\r\nfurnish pretexts for the objection of the poorer owners and ignorant\r\noccupiers to the supposed expense of the improvement which consists in\r\nan immediate outlay. Apart from such objections, however, it is a mode\r\nof obtaining supplies attended with great inconveniences, which it is\r\ndesirable to have considered with respect to new improvements. The\r\npayment of a dividend for an improved supply of such a commodity will be\r\nfound as imperfect a measure, even of its pecuniary value, as it would\r\nbe of the pecuniary value of a good and abundant supply of air and of\r\nthe light of day. There are numerous indirect effects of the use of such\r\na commodity, of which a pecuniary estimate cannot conveniently be made,\r\nas against an immediate outlay. For example, there is little ground left\r\nfor doubt that the effect of street and house cleansing by means of the\r\nsupplies of water needed in the worst districts, would occasion\r\nconsiderable reductions in the pecuniary charge of sickness on the\r\npoor’s rates, but it would be extremely difficult to obtain these\r\nresults in money to make up, with any pretence to accuracy, a profit and\r\nloss account as an undertaking for the outlay. The evidence afforded by\r\nthe creation and success of a private company proves only that a certain\r\nclass of persons so far appreciate the advantages of the supply as to be\r\nwilling to incur such an immediate expense as will cover the cost, and\r\nyield a profit to the undertakers; it proves nothing as to the intrinsic\r\nvalue of the service or the commodity, which may be immense to the bulk\r\nof the community, and yet not one be found ready to volunteer to defray\r\na portion of the expense. But the expense of the machinery of water\r\ncompanies, as already stated, is disproportioned to the means of the\r\nsmaller towns and to a large part of the country; and generations may\r\npass away amidst filth and pestilence before the scientific means and\r\nthe economy of prevention can be appreciated by them. And there are\r\nfurther objections made in towns to the mode of supply itself. One is,\r\nthat it creates strong interest against all improvements in the quality\r\nor the supplies of water; for every considerable improvement creates\r\nexpense, which is felt, in diminution of the dividends of the private\r\nshareholders; and so long as a majority of the ratepayers are content\r\nwith bad water, or deem it hopeless to seek to obtain water of a\r\nsuperior quality, so long as any public clamour will not endanger the\r\ndividends, it appears that no amendment entailing considerable expense\r\ncan be expected. Even where there are convenient unappropriated streams,\r\nand a wide field is afforded for competition by a very populous\r\ndistrict, the competition of different companies does not necessarily\r\nfurnish to the individual consumer any choice or amendment of the\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\nThe competition frequently absorbs the profit on the funds that might be\r\navailable to the competing parties (supposing them disposed to carry out\r\nany plans other than those which have for their object the cheapest\r\nsupply that can be procured), and does not reduce the charge of the\r\nsupply of water to the public. At one time there were three sets of\r\nwater-pipes belonging to three different companies passing through the\r\nsame streets of a large proportion of the metropolis. This wasteful\r\ncompetition of three immense capitals sunk in the supply of one\r\ndistrict, for which the expenditure of one capital and one establishment\r\nwould have sufficed, ended in an agreement between the competing\r\ncompanies to confine themselves to particular districts. The dividends\r\nat present obtained by the shareholders of the chief companies in the\r\nmetropolis on the capital now employed, appears, however, to be only 4,\r\n5, or 6 per cent., but this is on several expensive establishments and\r\nsets of officers, which appear to admit of consolidation. The committee\r\nof the House of Commons which investigated the subject of the supplies\r\nof water in 1821, concluded by recommending a consolidation of the\r\nseveral trusts, but excepting that the competition between them has\r\nabated, the expense and waste of separate establishments is still\r\ncontinued, and beyond this the expense of the fixed capital and\r\nestablishment, charged upon perhaps one-third the proper supply of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe private companies are also complained of as being practically\r\nirresponsible and arbitrary, and unaccommodating towards individuals. It\r\nis a further subject of complaint, as respects supplies by such\r\ncompanies, that they are directed almost exclusively to the supplies of\r\nsuch private houses as can pay water-rates; that they are not arranged\r\nfor the important objects of cleansing of the streets or drains, or of\r\nsupplying of water in case of fire. I have not been able to observe the\r\nextent of foundation for these complaints. Whilst no strong motive for\r\naggressive proceedings by the companies against individuals appears, the\r\nexisting force of the following statement made by the Committee referred\r\nto, which sat in 1821, will be admitted:—\r\n\r\n  “The public is at present without any protection, even against a\r\n  further indefinite extension of demand. In cases of dispute, there is\r\n  no tribunal but the boards of the companies themselves to which\r\n  individuals can appeal; there are no regulations but such as the\r\n  companies may have voluntarily imposed upon themselves, and may\r\n  therefore revoke at any time, for the continuance of the supply in its\r\n  present state, or for defining the cases in which it may be withdrawn\r\n  from the householder. All these points, and others of the same nature,\r\n  indispensably require legislative regulation, where the subject matter\r\n  is an article of the first necessity, and the supply has, from\r\n  peculiar circumstances, got into such a course that it is not under\r\n  the operation of those principles which govern supply and demand in\r\n  other cases.”\r\n\r\nSince the period of that report, there has been no legislation on the\r\nsubject other than that in new Acts, or on the renewal of old ones,\r\nclauses have been introduced empowering any individual rate-payer to\r\ndemand a supply of water.\r\n\r\nIn some instances legislative permissions have been given to the local\r\nauthorities to obtain supplies for the use of towns, but the permissions\r\nhave not been accompanied with the requisite powers to make them\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nBath, however, is supplied with water under the authority of the local\r\nAct of the 6 Geo. III. (c. 70), for paving, &c. which, after reciting\r\nthat there was a scarcity of water within the city and precincts, and\r\nthat there were in the neighbourhood of the said city several springs of\r\nwater belonging to the corporation, enacts that the corporation shall\r\nhave full power to cause water to be conveyed to the said city from such\r\nsprings, and gives them authority to enter upon and break up the soil of\r\nany public highway, or common, or waste ground, and the soil of any\r\nprivate grounds within two miles of the city, and the soil or pavement\r\nof any street within the city, in order to drain and collect the water\r\nof the springs, and to make reservoirs sufficient for keeping such\r\nwater, and to erect conduits, water-houses, and engines necessary for\r\ndistributing it, and to lay under ground aqueducts and pipes most\r\nconvenient for the same purpose. The Act vests the right and property of\r\nall water-courses leading from the said springs to the city, and also of\r\nall reservoirs, conduits, water-houses, and engines, erected or used for\r\nthe purpose, in the mayor, aldermen, and citizens of Bath. The following\r\nextract from a communication from the _Rev. Whitwell Elwin_, who has\r\nclosely investigated the economy of the poorest classes in that city,\r\nthus describes the present state of the supply:—\r\n\r\n  “Bath is surrounded by hills which pour down a vast quantity of water\r\n  into reservoirs. Pipes are laid from these reservoirs to every part of\r\n  Bath, and as the springs from which the water originally rises are as\r\n  high up on the hills as the roofs of the houses, water can be carried\r\n  into the attics without the application of a forcing pump: thus no\r\n  machinery is employed. The only water-works are the pipes which convey\r\n  the water.\r\n\r\n  “These reservoirs are the property of different persons, and there are\r\n  five distinct parties by which particular districts in Bath are\r\n  supplied. They are the Bath Corporation, the Freemen’s Company, the\r\n  Circus Company, the Duke of Cleveland, and Captain Gunning. There can\r\n  scarcely be said to be any competition, because the possession of a\r\n  spring in a particular locality gives a monopoly of the surrounding\r\n  neighbourhood. But wherever there is room for selection, the supply of\r\n  the corporation is always preferred. It is often resorted to even\r\n  where the distance is much greater than to other springs; the supply\r\n  being more regular, more abundant, and cheaper than the rest, with the\r\n  exception of that of the Duke of Cleveland, who only provides his own\r\n  tenants. The corporation supplies more than three parts of the town.\r\n  There are at present 2184 persons paying water-rates, but the number\r\n  of houses furnished with water is considerably greater, because courts\r\n  and rows of cottages have frequently a common cistern. Where this is\r\n  the case each cottage making use of the cistern pays a rent of 10_s._\r\n  a-year, and where the house has a cistern of its own, 20_s._ a-year.\r\n  The charge for the water is in proportion to the rent of the house.\r\n  The quantity of water supplied is about a hogshead a-day. In summer,\r\n  when the springs are low, the quantity is not so great. The laying\r\n  down and repair of the feather, that is the pipe which branches from\r\n  the main pipe, is at the cost of the tenant.\r\n\r\n  “In addition to these private supplies the corporation provides five\r\n  public pumps, which are open to all the inhabitants free of expense.\r\n\r\n  “The greater part of the cottages in the town itself, but not in the\r\n  suburbs, make use of the water-works. There is generally a pump in\r\n  addition, which yields water too hard and bad for domestic purposes.\r\n\r\n  “The water rents of the corporation for the last year were 3,233_l._\r\n  2_s._, the expenses (including salaries, rent for springs, repairs of\r\n  pipes) 449_l._ 3_s._ 3_d._, thus leaving a profit of 2,783_l._ 18_s._\r\n  9_d._ This sum is applied to the reduction of the borough rate.\r\n\r\n  “The advantages of this system over private companies appear to me\r\n  great and incontestable. Here are no expenses for solicitors, or\r\n  litigation between rival concerns; no collusion between coalescing\r\n  companies to raise the charges to the utmost amount that the\r\n  inhabitants will bear; no exorbitant salaries to the variety of\r\n  officers, which every separate establishment demands. A few watermen,\r\n  whose united salaries are only 114_l._ 8_s._ per annum, is the sole\r\n  addition to the ordinary corporation machinery. When to this we add\r\n  that all the profits are for the benefit of the town and not for\r\n  individuals—that the sum paid in water-rate is thus pretty nearly\r\n  deducted from the borough rate—we can hardly hesitate to strike the\r\n  balance. The corporation management, here at least, gives unlimited\r\n  satisfaction. They are under the direct control of the ratepayers,\r\n  properly desirous to conciliate their opinion, and are sure to hear of\r\n  any incivility, which, as they have no interest in protecting it, they\r\n  are always ready to redress.”\r\n\r\nIn this instance, however, it is to be observed that the real cost of\r\nthe water to the corporation is not more than one-seventh their charge\r\nto the consumer; consequently, the charge for a supply out of the house\r\nmay be said to be less than 1_s._ 6_d._ per annum; and it will admit of\r\nlittle doubt that if the water were lifted by steam power and carried\r\ninto every tenement, as it might be, the actual expense need not be\r\ndoubled; six-sevenths then of the charge, which is about the same as the\r\nordinary charges of water companies, is to be considered as a borough\r\nrate, levied in the shape of a water rate, applied doubtless to some\r\nother proper public services.\r\n\r\nAn example is presented in Manchester of the practicability of obtaining\r\nsupplies for the common benefit of a town without the agency of private\r\ncompanies. In that town gas has for some years past been supplied from\r\nworks erected and conducted not by the municipality but by a body\r\nappointed under a local Act by an elected committee of the ratepayers.\r\nThis mode of supplying the town was, it appears, violently opposed by\r\nprivate interests; but I am informed that the supplies of gas are of as\r\ngood or even of a better quality, and cheaper than those obtained from\r\nprivate companies in adjacent towns; that improvements in the\r\nmanufacture of the gas are more speedily adopted than in private\r\nassociations, and the profits are reserved as a public fund for the\r\nimprovement of the town. Out of this fund a fine Town Hall has been\r\nerected, whole streets have been widened, and various large improvements\r\nhave been made; and the income now available for the further improvement\r\nof the town exceeds 10,000_l._ per annum, after providing for the\r\nexpense of management and the interest of the sinking fund on the money\r\nborrowed. There are now in the same districts in the metropolis no less\r\nthan three immense capitals sunk in competition,—three sets of gas-pipes\r\npassing through the same streets, three expensive sets of principal and\r\nsubordinate officers where one would suffice, comparatively high charges\r\nfor gas to the consumers, and low dividends to the shareholders of the\r\ncompanies in competition. Where a scientific and trustworthy agency can\r\nbe obtained for the public, manifest opportunities present themselves\r\nfor considerable economy on such modes of obtaining supplies. A proposal\r\nwas made in Manchester to obtain supplies of water for the town in the\r\nsame manner as the supplies of gas, but the owners of the private pumps,\r\nwho, it is stated, have the monopoly of the convenient springs, and\r\nexact double the charge for which even private companies are ready to\r\nconvey supplies into the houses, made a compact and effectual opposition\r\nto the proposal, contending that the supplies of rain-water (which are\r\nsometimes absolutely black with the soot held in suspension), together\r\nwith that from the springs was sufficient, and the proposal was\r\ndefeated. These petty interests could not, however, avail against the\r\nmore powerful interest of a joint-stock company, which was established\r\nto procure supplies for the middle and wealthier classes of the town.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be no reason to doubt that the mode of supplying water\r\nto Bath and gas to the town of Manchester might be generally adopted in\r\nsupplying water to the population. Powers would be required to enter\r\ninto the lands adjacent to the towns on a reasonable compensation to the\r\nowners to obtain supplies of water; and, as the management of\r\nwater-works requires appropriate skill, it would be necessary to appoint\r\nan officer with special qualifications for their superintendence.\r\nOrdinary service may be obtained for the public, if recourse be had to\r\nthe ordinary motives by which such service is engaged in private\r\ncompanies. It is not mentioned invidiously, but as a matter of fact,\r\nthat the majority, not to say the whole, of such undertakings by joint\r\nstock companies, are, in the first instance, moved by a solicitor, or\r\nengineer, or other person, for the sake of the office of manager of the\r\nworks, and that the directors and shareholders, and the inducement of\r\nprofit to them, through the benefit undoubtedly to the public, are only\r\nthe machinery to the attainment of the object for which the undertaking\r\nis primarily moved. If competent officers be appointed and adequately\r\nremunerated for the service, there can be little doubt that the public\r\nmay, as at Bath and Manchester, be saved the expense of the management\r\nby the occasional attendance of unskilled directors, and that they may\r\nsave the expense of dividends, or apply the profits to public\r\nimprovements, as at Manchester, and moreover avoid the inconveniences\r\nand obstructions undoubtedly belonging to the supply of a commodity so\r\nessential to the public health, comfort, and economy, by a private\r\nmonopoly. Bad supplies of water would, I apprehend, generally be less\r\ntolerated by the influential inhabitants of all parties from a public\r\nmunicipal agency than from a private company.\r\n\r\nAnother ground for the recommendation that supplies of water for the\r\nlabouring classes should be brought under some public authority, is that\r\nsome care may be taken to prevent the use of unwholesome supplies.\r\n\r\nThe queries transmitted to the medical officers were directed to\r\nascertain the sufficiency of the supplies for the purpose of cleansing,\r\nbut the returns frequently advert to the bad effect of inferior supplies\r\nupon the health of the population; and it is scarcely conceivable to\r\nwhat filthy water custom reconciles the people. Yet water containing\r\nanimal matter, which is the most feared, appears to be less frequently\r\ninjurious than that which is the clearest, namely, spring-water, from\r\nthe latter being oftener impregnated with mineral substances; but there\r\nare instances of ill health produced by both descriptions of water. The\r\nbeneficial effects derived from care as to the qualities of the water is\r\nnow proved in the navy, where fatal dysentery formerly prevailed to an\r\nimmense extent, in consequence of the impure and putrid state of the\r\nsupplies; and care is now generally exercised on the subject by the\r\nmedical officers of the army. In the Dublin Hospital Reports, for\r\nexample, we have the following statement, which is still more important,\r\nas showing the extent to which the nature of the water influences\r\nhealth:—\r\n\r\n  “Dr. M. Barry affirms that the troops were frequently liable to\r\n  dysentery, while they occupied the old barracks at Cork; but he has\r\n  heard that it has been of rare occurrence in the new barracks. Several\r\n  years ago, when the disease raged violently in the old barracks, (now\r\n  the depôt for convicts,) the care of the sick was, in the absence of\r\n  the regimental surgeon, entrusted to the late Mr. Bell, surgeon, in\r\n  Cork. At the period in question the troops were supplied with water\r\n  from the river Lee, which, in passing through the city, is rendered\r\n  unfit for drinking by the influx of the contents of the sewers from\r\n  the houses, and likewise is brackish from the tide, which ascends into\r\n  their channels. Mr. Bell, suspecting that the water might have caused\r\n  the dysentery, upon assuming the care of the sick, had a number of\r\n  water-carts engaged to bring water for the troops from a spring called\r\n  the Lady’s Well, at the same time that they were no longer permitted\r\n  to drink the water from the river. From this simple, but judicious\r\n  arrangement, the dysentery very shortly disappeared among the\r\n  troops.”—_Dublin Hospital Reports_, vol. iii. 11. Paper by Dr. Cheyne\r\n  “On Dysentery.”\r\n\r\n_Parent du Chatelet_, the most industrious and able of modern\r\ninvestigators into questions of public health, gives the following\r\ninstance, which in like manner demonstrates the amount of disease\r\ngenerated solely by the use of bad water, as well as the difficulty of\r\ndetecting the specific effects produced by it:—\r\n\r\n  “When I visited last year the prisons of Paris with my friend\r\n  Villermé, who was interested in prisons generally, I was extremely\r\n  surprised at the proportion of sick in the hospital of St. Lazarus,\r\n  relatively to the whole population of the prisons. The prison, uniting\r\n  all the conditions necessary to health as regards its position,\r\n  construction, the dress and food of the prisoners, who were constantly\r\n  kept at work, how explain the much greater proportion of sick to what\r\n  we remark in other prisons of a bad condition, and in which are found\r\n  united all the apparent causes of unhealthiness?—This, I must confess,\r\n  has baffled all calculation, and has driven every one to say that\r\n  there must be a cause for the peculiarity, but that it could not he\r\n  discovered. I do not despair to have hit upon that cause, and I\r\n  believe it is to be recognised in the nature of the water drunk by the\r\n  prisoners. Having tasted it in the wooden reservoir behind the house,\r\n  which was in bad order, and full of plants of the genus confervæ, I\r\n  found it had a detestable and truly repulsive taste, a circumstance\r\n  which does not appear to have been hitherto remarked. Might not the\r\n  cause, then, he detected in the chemical nature of the water of\r\n  Belleville and of the neighbourhood of St. Gervais, of which the\r\n  prisoners drink exclusively? What proves it is the striking\r\n  resemblance which exists in this respect between the water of\r\n  Belleville and that in the wells of the entrance-court of the hospital\r\n  of the Salpêtriere, which both contain a very great proportion of\r\n  sulphate of lime, and other purgative salts. Now the venerable\r\n  Professor Pinel and his pupil Schwilgué have remarked for more than 20\r\n  years the influence that the water of the wells of which I speak has\r\n  upon the portion of the population of the hospital who make use of it,\r\n  and they believe that certain affections connected evidently with\r\n  locality cannot be attributed to any other cause, and particularly the\r\n  disposition to chronic diarrhœa which is so often observed in this\r\n  hospital. It turns out upon examination _that the greater part of the\r\n  sick who fill the infirmary of the prison of St. Lazarus are brought\r\n  there for illnesses of the same identical nature_. In the prison they\r\n  are obliged to have recourse to the water of the Seine to cook the\r\n  vegetables and other food, an evident proof of the truth, or at least\r\n  the probability, of all I have just advanced.”\r\n\r\nIn the metropolis the public owes the analysis of the supplies of water\r\nand some improvement of supplies not in their nature essentially bad,\r\nchiefly to the stirring of speculators in rival companies. But the\r\npopulation of the rural districts, and of the smaller towns, afford no\r\nmeans for the payment of companies, still less any field for pecuniary\r\ncompetition. As in the cases cited, it is to be feared that the\r\nknowledge gained for the safety of the health of the soldiers and the\r\nprisoners was not proclaimed for the protection of the bulk of the\r\npoorest population, who, under existing arrangements, only receive care\r\nin the shape of alleviations, when the suffering from disease is\r\nattended by the destitution which establishes the claim to relief. The\r\nmiddle classes are exposed to the like inconveniences, and put up with\r\nvery inferior water, whilst supplies of a salubrious quality might be\r\nobtained by extended public arrangements for the common benefit.\r\n\r\nIt will not be deemed necessary to attempt to develope all the\r\nconsiderations applicable to the subject; and I confine myself to the\r\nrepresentation of the fact,—That there is wide foundation for the\r\ncomplaint that proper supplies of water to large portions of the\r\ncommunity are extensively wanting—that those obtained are frequently of\r\ninferior quality—that they are commonly obtained at the greatest expense\r\nwhen obtained by hand labour—that the supplies by private companies,\r\nthough cheaper and better, are defective, and chiefly restricted to the\r\nuse of the higher and middle classes, unless in such inconvenient modes\r\n(_i. e._ by cocks in courts), as seriously to impede the growth of\r\nhabits of cleanliness amongst the working classes. To which I venture to\r\nadd, as the expression of an opinion founded on communications from all\r\nparts of the kingdom, that as a highly important sanitary measure\r\nconnected with any general building regulations, whether for villages or\r\nfor any class of towns, arrangements should be made for all houses to be\r\nsupplied with good water, and should be prescribed as being as essential\r\nto cleanliness and health as the possession of a roof or of due space;\r\nthat for this purpose, and in places where the supplies are not at\r\npresent satisfactory, power should be vested in the most eligible local\r\nadministrative body, which will generally be found to be that having\r\ncharge of cleansing and structural arrangements, to procure proper\r\nsupplies for the cleansing of the streets, for sewerage, for protection\r\nagainst fires, as well as for domestic use.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _Sanitary Effect of Land Drainage._\r\n\r\nIn considering the circumstances external to the residence which affect\r\nthe sanitary condition of the population, the importance of a general\r\nland drainage is developed by the inquiries as to the causes of the\r\nprevalent diseases, to be of a magnitude of which no conception had been\r\nformed at the commencement of the investigation: its importance is\r\nmanifested by the severe consequences of its neglect in every part of\r\nthe country, as well as by its advantages in the increasing salubrity\r\nand productiveness wherever the drainage has been skilful and effectual.\r\nThe following instance is presented in a report from _Mr. John Marshall,\r\nJun._, the clerk to the union in the Isle of Ely:—\r\n\r\n  “It has been shown that the Isle of Ely was at one period in a\r\n  desolate state, being frequently inundated by the upland waters, and\r\n  destitute of adequate means of drainage; the lower parts became a\r\n  wilderness of stagnant pools, the exhalations from which loaded the\r\n  air with pestiferous vapours and fogs; now, by the improvements which\r\n  have from time to time been made, and particularly within the last\r\n  fifty years, an alteration has taken place which may appear to be the\r\n  effect of magic. By the labour, industry, and spirit of the\r\n  inhabitants, a forlorn waste has been converted into pleasant and\r\n  fertile pastures, and they themselves have been rewarded by bounteous\r\n  harvests. Drainage, embankments, engines, and enclosures have given\r\n  stability to the soil (which in its nature is as rich as the Delta of\r\n  Egypt) as well as salubrity to the air. These very considerable\r\n  improvements, though carried on at a great expense, have at last\r\n  turned to a double account, both in reclaiming much ground and\r\n  improving the rest, and in contributing to the healthiness of the\r\n  inhabitants. Works of modern refinement have given a totally different\r\n  face and character to this once neglected spot; much has been\r\n  performed, much yet remains to be accomplished by the rising\r\n  generation. The demand for labour produced by drainage is\r\n  incalculable, but when it is stated that where sedge and rushes but a\r\n  few years since we now have fields of waving oats and even wheat, it\r\n  must be evident that it is very great.\r\n\r\n  “On reference to a very perfect account of the baptisms, marriages,\r\n  and burials, in Wisbech, from 1558 to 1826, I find that in the\r\n  decennial periods, of which 1801, 1811, and 1821, were the middle\r\n  years, the baptisms and burials were as under:—\r\n\r\n                       Baptisms. Burials. Population in 1801.\r\n          1796 to 1805   1,627    1,535          4,710\r\n          1806 to 1815   1,654    1,313          5,209\r\n          1816 to 1825   2,165    1,390          6,515\r\n\r\n  “In the first of the three periods the mortality was 1 in 31; in the\r\n  second, 1 in 40; in the third, 1 in 47; the latter being less than the\r\n  exact mean mortality of the kingdom for the last two years. (_See\r\n  Registrar-general’s Second Report, p. 4, folio edition._) These\r\n  figures clearly show that the mortality has wonderfully diminished in\r\n  the last half century, and who can doubt but that the increased\r\n  salubrity of the fens produced by drainage is a chief cause of the\r\n  improvement.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. R. Turner_, medical officer of the Newhaven union, states,—\r\n\r\n  “The district which has been under my care comprises five parishes,\r\n  three of which, viz., Kingston, Iford, and Rodmell, are (more\r\n  especially the two latter) situate in close proximity to marshes,\r\n  which were formerly for a considerable portion of the year inundated;\r\n  of late very extensive improvements have taken place in the drainage\r\n  of these levels, and in consequence of that change, the diseases\r\n  constantly engendered by marsh miasmata, viz., typhus and intermittent\r\n  fevers, are not more common than in other districts which present to\r\n  the eye a fairer prospect of health.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. G. R. Rowe_, medical officer of the Ongar union, observes,—\r\n\r\n  “It is worthy of remark, that in the districts surrounding Chigwell no\r\n  malignant, infectious, or contagious disease has appeared during my\r\n  experience of thirty years’ occasional residence, and even during the\r\n  prevalence of cholera not one case occurred. The land is well drained,\r\n  the situation elevated, and the cleanly habits of the poor, with the\r\n  benevolence of its residents, have tended much to the prevention of\r\n  disease, and its amelioration when occurring.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. W. Sanders_, medical officer of the Gravesend and Milton union,\r\nstates,—\r\n\r\n  “I beg leave to suggest how extreme are the beneficial effects of a\r\n  proper drainage, which shall prevent stagnant water, and its\r\n  deleterious consequences, accumulating in crowded neighbourhoods. This\r\n  is exemplified in this town, and also in Tilbury Fort opposite, which\r\n  is built on a marsh, and where, during the cholera period, then under\r\n  my care, not a single case occurred.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Emerson_, one of the medical officers of the Eastry union, states,—\r\n\r\n  “There is, I believe, no locality which has been for some years so\r\n  exempt from fevers of a malignant and contagious character as the\r\n  eastern coast of Kent. Accordingly, idiopathic fever, under the form\r\n  of synochus and typhus, very rarely occurs, and when it does appear,\r\n  is generally of an isolated kind. Intermittents, also, which fifteen\r\n  or twenty years since were so generally prevalent in this district,\r\n  have become comparatively of rare occurrence, and indeed have almost\r\n  disappeared from the catalogue of our local endemics. This exemption\r\n  from ague and other febrile epidemics of an infectious nature may be\r\n  justly imputed to the total absence of malaria, and of all those\r\n  causes which usually generate an unwholesome and contaminating\r\n  atmosphere, viz., from the whole district being secured from\r\n  inundations by the most complete and effectual system of drainage and\r\n  sewerage. Also, from the exposed state of the country favouring a free\r\n  and rapid evaporation from the surface of the soil.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. George Elgar_, another of the medical officers of the Eastry union,\r\nobserves that,—\r\n\r\n  “The parishes forming the fifth district of the Eastry union, are,\r\n  with one or two exceptions, close to marshes separating the Isle of\r\n  Thanet from this portion of East Kent, and consequently, during the\r\n  spring and autumn, the inhabitants are exposed to the malaria\r\n  therefrom; but for these last few years, owing to the excellent plan\r\n  of draining, very few diseases have occurred (in my opinion) that can\r\n  be said to be produced by malaria. There is very little ague, scarcely\r\n  any continued fevers; and a case of typhus, I believe, has not been\r\n  known along the borders of the marshes for these last three or four\r\n  years. Some years back, a great portion of the parishes adjoining\r\n  these marshes was under water from the end of autumn to the early part\r\n  of the following spring; then, agues and fevers of all characters\r\n  prevailed to a very great extent. Although the malaria does not\r\n  produce diseases of any _decided character_, yet, during a wet spring\r\n  or autumn, there are always cases of inflammation of the lungs or\r\n  bowels, and rheumatism, both in acute and chronic forms. The houses in\r\n  general are good, well drained and well ventilated, having one or two\r\n  sitting-rooms, as many bed-rooms, sometimes more, scullery, &c., and\r\n  convenient receptacles for refuse and fuel. The cottages generally are\r\n  _extremely cleanly_; of course there must be some exceptions, where\r\n  the occupiers would not be clean and careful under any circumstances.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Spurgin_, the medical officer of the Dunmow union, states—\r\n\r\n  “In this district great attention is paid to the cultivation of land,\r\n  under drainage being much attended to, on which account partly we are\r\n  not exposed to malaria, neither does ague prevail to any extent. A few\r\n  cases have occurred, and when they have it has been for the most part\r\n  in individuals whose systems have been impaired by irregular habits,\r\n  and consequently the more readily affected by external impressions, as\r\n  atmospheric vicissitudes.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. D. R. M’Nab_, the medical officer of the Epping union, states that—\r\n\r\n  “The health of the inhabitants of these two parishes is on the whole\r\n  highly satisfactory, as will appear by this return, but I would\r\n  observe that the sanitary condition of two localities would be greatly\r\n  improved by a little attention on the part of the public surveyors and\r\n  others to the drains and ditches immediately abutting on the dwellings\r\n  of the poor inhabitants. I refer more especially to that part of\r\n  Epping which is denominated the Back-street, and the greater part of\r\n  which is in the parish of Coopersall. In very wet weather the drains\r\n  and ditches are flooded; in very dry, on the contrary, they are by the\r\n  evaporation of the fluids rendered very offensive, and thus almost all\r\n  our cases of malignant fever are situated amongst those dwellings; if\r\n  the neighbourhood had been crowded with inhabitants the mischief would\r\n  have been much greater; and even as it now is, it has been the cause\r\n  of much fatality among the able-bodied men and women. The same\r\n  observations are applicable to Duck-lane in the parish of Weald, and\r\n  also at the Gullett, but in the latter case it is principally owing to\r\n  the carelessness and filth of one or two families, who have thrown all\r\n  sorts of excrementitious substances around their dwellings, and in the\r\n  course of putrefaction it has occasionally become pestiferous.\r\n\r\n  “I may also venture to add the following observation, after twenty-six\r\n  years’ practice in this neighbourhood, that I have scarcely ever had a\r\n  case of typhus fever in a malignant form without discovering some\r\n  stagnant drain or overcharged cesspool, or some other manifest cause\r\n  of malaria in the immediate residence of the patient.”\r\n\r\nIn the reports given from the parish ministers in the statistical\r\naccounts of Scotland, the effects of drainage upon the general health of\r\nthe population are strongly marked in almost every county, expressed in\r\nnotes made from an examination of the returns. Sutherland—parish of\r\n_Rogart_, “healthy, and a good deal of draining.” _Farr_, “subject to no\r\nparticular disease; a deal of draining.” Ross and Cromarty—_Alness_, dry\r\nand healthy, “climate improved by drainage.” It is to be understood that\r\ndrainage appears to form the essential part of agricultural improvement,\r\nwhich is connected with the improvement of health. Thus the notes from\r\nanother parish in the same county, _Kilmuir_, _Wester_ and _Suddy_,\r\nstates it as “healthy; great improvement; scarcely an acre in its\r\noriginal state.” _Rosemarkie_, “healthy; agriculture much improved.”\r\nElgin—_New Spynie_, “healthy, much waste reclaimed, much draining.”\r\n_Alves_, “dry and healthy, well cultivated, wood sometimes used for\r\ndrains.” Banff—_Deckford_, “healthy, and people long lived, much\r\ndraining.” Kincardine—_Fordoun_, “so much draining that now no swamps:\r\nformerly, agues common, now quite unknown.” Angus—_Carmylie_, “health\r\nimproved from draining.” Kinross—_Kinross_, “agues prevalent sixty years\r\nago in consequence of marshes, now never met with.” _Oswell_, “ague\r\nprevailed formerly, but not since the land was drained.”\r\nPerth—_Methven_, “the north much improved by draining.” _Redgorton_,\r\n“healthy; no prevailing disease; ague was frequent formerly, but not\r\nsince the land has been drained and planted.” _Moneydie_, “healthy; an\r\nimmense improvement by draining.” _Abernyte_, “since the land was\r\ndrained, scrofula rare and ague unknown.” _Monzie_, “healthy; a good\r\ndeal of land reclaimed.” _Auchterarder_, “much draining, and waste land\r\nreclaimed—climate good.” _Muckhart_, “great improvement in agriculture;\r\nague formerly prevalent—not so now.” _Muthill_, “healthy, much draining\r\nand cultivation extended.” And similar statements are made from the\r\nrural districts in all parts of the country.\r\n\r\nIn the course of inquiries as to what have been the effects of land\r\ndrainage upon health, one frequent piece of information received has\r\nbeen that the rural population had not observed the effects on their own\r\nhealth, but they had marked the effects of drainage on the health and\r\nimprovement of the stock. Thus the less frequent losses of stock from\r\nepidemics are beginning to be perceived as accompanying the benefits of\r\ndrainage in addition to those of increased vegetable production.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Edward Harrison_, in a paper in which he points out the connexion\r\nbetween the rot in sheep and other animals, and some important disorders\r\nin the human constitution, observes:—\r\n\r\n  “The connexion between humidity and the rot is universally admitted by\r\n  experienced graziers; and it is a matter of observation, that since\r\n  the brooks and rivulets in the county of Lincoln have been better\r\n  managed, and the system of laying ground dry, by open ditches and\r\n  under-draining, has been more judiciously practised, the rot is become\r\n  far less prevalent. Sir John Pringle informs us, that persons have\r\n  maintained themselves in good health, during sickly seasons, by\r\n  inhabiting the upper stories of their houses; and I have reason to\r\n  believe that, merely by confining sheep on high grounds through the\r\n  night, they have escaped the rot.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. Harrison_ makes some observations on the effects of imperfect\r\ndrainage in aggravating the evils intended to be remedied, of which\r\nfrequent instances are presented in the course of this inquiry:—\r\n\r\n  “A grazier of my acquaintance has, for many years, occupied a large\r\n  portion of an unenclosed fen, in which was a shallow piece of water\r\n  that covered about an acre and a half of land. To recover it for\r\n  pasturage, he cut in it several open ditches to let off the water, and\r\n  obtained an imperfect drainage. His sheep immediately afterwards\r\n  became liable to the rot, and in most years he lost some of them. In\r\n  1792 the drains failed so entirely, from the wetness of the season,\r\n  that he got another pond of living water, and sustained, in that\r\n  season, no loss of his flock. For a few succeeding years, he was\r\n  generally visited with the rot; but having satisfied himself by\r\n  experience, that whenever the pit was, from the weather, either\r\n  completely dry or completely under water, his flock was free from the\r\n  disorder, he attempted a more perfect drainage, and succeeded in\r\n  making the land dry at all times. Since that period he has lost no\r\n  sheep from the rot, though, till within the last two years, he\r\n  continued to occupy the fen. * * *\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Harrison, of Fisherton, near Lincoln, has by judicious management\r\n  laid the greatest part of his farm completely dry, and is now little\r\n  troubled with the rot, unless when he wishes to give it to some\r\n  particular animals. His neighbours, who have been less provident, are\r\n  still severe sufferers by it, nor are their misfortunes confined to\r\n  sheep alone. Pigs, cows, asses, horses, poultry, hares, and rabbits,\r\n  become rotten in this lordship, and have flukes in their\r\n  livers. * * * *\r\n\r\n  “The late Mr. Bakewell was of opinion, that after May-Day, he could\r\n  communicate the rot at pleasure, by flooding, and afterwards stocking\r\n  his closes, while they were drenched and saturated with moisture. In\r\n  summer, rivers and brooks are often suddenly swollen by\r\n  thunder-storms, so as to pass over their banks, and cover the adjacent\r\n  low lands. In this state, no injury is sustained during the\r\n  inundation; but when the water returns to its former channel, copious\r\n  exhalations are produced from the swamps and low lands, which are\r\n  exceedingly dangerous to the human constitution, and to several other\r\n  animals, as well as sheep. * *\r\n\r\n  “A medical gentleman of great experience at Boston, in Lincolnshire,\r\n  and who is considerably advanced in life, has frequently observed to\r\n  me, that intermittents are so much diminished in his circuit, that an\r\n  ounce of the cinchona goes further at this time in the treatment of\r\n  agues than a pound of it did within his own recollection. During his\r\n  father’s practice at Boston, they were still more obstinate and\r\n  severe. For my own part, I have declared, for several years, in\r\n  various companies, that marsh miasmata are the cause of both agues and\r\n  the rot. And as miasmata are admitted, by the concurring testimonies\r\n  of medical practitioners in every part of the globe, to be produced by\r\n  the action of the sun upon low, swampy grounds, I hope this\r\n  interesting subject will be fully investigated, and effectual plans\r\n  carried into execution, for the preservation of man, and of the\r\n  animals which are so useful to him.”\r\n\r\nI may here mention a circumstance which occurred at the Poor Law\r\nCommission Office, and which with succeeding information tended to\r\ndirect our attention to the subject of sanitary measures of prevention\r\nfor the protection of the rates. A medical officer of one of the Unions\r\nwho came to town for the transaction of some business before the Board,\r\nbegged to be favoured by the immediate despatch of his business,\r\ninasmuch as, from a change of weather which had taken place since his\r\ndeparture, he was certain that he should have a number of cases waiting\r\nfor him. On being asked to explain the circumstances from which he\r\ninferred the occurrence of disease with so much certainty, he stated\r\nthat within his district there was a reservoir to feed a canal: that\r\nthey had let out the water as they were accustomed to do in spring time\r\nfor the purpose of cleansing it; and that whenever such weather occurred\r\nas then prevailed during the process, he was sure to have a great number\r\nof fever cases amongst the labourers in the village which immediately\r\nadjoined the reservoir. It appeared to be, in fact, a case in which the\r\nrot was propagated amongst the labourers in the village under\r\ncircumstances similar to those before cited in which it was propagated\r\namongst the sheep.\r\n\r\nThe following portions of evidence afford instances of the condition in\r\nwhich a larger proportion of the country remains, from the neglect of\r\ngeneral land drainage, than would be conceived from any _à priori_\r\nestimate of the amount of prevalent intelligence and enterprize.\r\n\r\n_Mr. R. W. Martyr_, one of the medical officers of the Langport union,\r\nthus describes the condition of a large proportion of his district:—\r\n\r\n  “The parishes of Kingsbury and Long Sutton being the district No. 1 B\r\n  of the Langford union, the population of which amounts to above 3,000;\r\n  Kingsbury, containing 2,000; and Long Sutton 1,000, or thereabouts.\r\n  Both these parishes are partly surrounded by low meadow land, and are\r\n  liable to frequent inundations, often covering many thousand acres,\r\n  and sometimes to a great depth; the level of much of this land being\r\n  below the bed of the main river or drains, makes it very difficult\r\n  (when once inundated) in very wet seasons to drain or carry off the\r\n  immense body of water they often contain.\r\n\r\n  “These inundations are caused by the banks of the main rivers not\r\n  being sufficiently strong or elevated, and from the bridges not being\r\n  capacious enough to carry the immense body of water brought down from\r\n  the neighbouring hills and country higher up, which, in heavy rains,\r\n  sometimes takes place so rapidly as to completely overflow the banks\r\n  in twenty-four hours; but besides the casual or accidental giving way\r\n  of the banks of the rivers, it is sometimes done by interested persons\r\n  for the purpose of warding off the mischief from themselves by\r\n  throwing it on their neighbours.\r\n\r\n  “When these floods occur in the winter season, and there is but little\r\n  herbage, or early in the spring, and are followed by dry weather, the\r\n  surface of the ground becomes dry and healthy, and they are then\r\n  highly beneficial to the land, and but little prejudicial to the\r\n  health of the surrounding inhabitants; but when, as is sometimes the\r\n  case, these floods take place late in April, May and June, and cover\r\n  hundreds of acres of hay, some cut and some uncut, and which must of\r\n  course rot on the ground, the effluvia and stench is then often\r\n  unbearable, and highly prejudicial to the health of the neighbouring\r\n  villages, and it is sometimes years before the land recovers its\r\n  healthy state, producing nothing but rank herbage, and causing agues,\r\n  fevers, dysentery, and numerous other diseases. Many of these evils\r\n  may, I think, be remedied if the owners of large estates in this\r\n  neighbourhood would interest themselves in the matter: I am persuaded\r\n  the increased value of their property would amply repay the outlay\r\n  necessary for the purpose. When the land is in this unhealthy state,\r\n  it appears to be equally prejudicial to the animal as the human\r\n  subject, producing numerous diseases among cattle, particularly among\r\n  sheep, many farmers losing the whole of their flocks.\r\n\r\n  “Although much remains to be done to remedy the mischief complained\r\n  of, yet a considerable improvement has taken place within the last\r\n  twenty years by enclosing many of the large commons, and by that means\r\n  partially draining them; and also by enlarging the back drains which\r\n  carry the water to a lower level into the main river, by which means\r\n  it is carried off much sooner, and less mischief is done, than if it\r\n  remained longer on the surface of the land.\r\n\r\n  “It is stated in a very old history of Somerset, that about 300 years\r\n  ago, nearly the whole of the inhabitants of Kingsbury, Muchelney, and\r\n  Long Load, were carried off by a pestilence (without doubt meaning a\r\n  malignant fever); and that for many years afterwards it was considered\r\n  so unhealthy that it was inhabited solely by outlaws, and persons of\r\n  the worst character, a clear proof the country is in a much healthier\r\n  state now than it was in former times.\r\n\r\n  “In addition to the more general causes of disease arising from the\r\n  flat state of the country, and its liability to inundations, are many\r\n  others of a more local character, and much easier of removal, in the\r\n  village of Kingsbury; and in many others there are numerous pits or\r\n  ponds in the winter season filled with muddy water, and, in summer,\r\n  mud alone: these are often situated in the front or at the back of the\r\n  cottages, and are receptacles for all manner of filth, and in certain\r\n  seasons are productive of very serious diseases, and at all times\r\n  highly injurious to health. Besides the mud pits above mentioned,\r\n  there is scarcely a cottage that is not surrounded with all manner of\r\n  filth, oftentimes close to the doors of the inhabitants, very few of\r\n  the cottages being provided with privies, or if there be any, they\r\n  only add to the general nuisance from being open and without drains.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Oldham_, the medical officer of the Chesterfield union, gives the\r\nfollowing account of his district:—\r\n\r\n  “Wessington is situated upon an elevation, but the houses are arranged\r\n  around a green or unenclosed common, upon the surface of which are a\r\n  great number of small pools, which, for the most part, are stagnant.\r\n  In the winter season they overflow, and at this season the\r\n  neighbourhood appears less infected with fever. In the summer months,\r\n  and greater part of the spring and autumn, they are stagnant, and\r\n  undoubtedly a fruitful source of malaria; indeed the neighbourhood of\r\n  Wessington is scarcely ever free from fever at these seasons of the\r\n  year.\r\n\r\n  “It perhaps may not be amiss to mention, I have attended a number of\r\n  persons in the neighbourhood of this common who have been attacked\r\n  with fever, who were at the same time well fed, and lived in\r\n  comfortable and tolerably well-ventilated houses.”\r\n\r\nHe then adduces instances, and proceeds—\r\n\r\n  “From the facts before mentioned, I am led to conclude that the\r\n  decomposition constantly going on in these small pools is the source\r\n  of the malaria, and that the malaria so engendered propagates fever.\r\n  1st. Because there are cases of fever in this locality nearly all the\r\n  year. 2d. Because paupers, and persons who are better fed, and live in\r\n  more comfortable and better ventilated houses in the neighbourhood of\r\n  this green or common, are attacked with the disease, and, I may say,\r\n  almost indiscriminately. 3d. Because during the years I have attended\r\n  the paupers of the district, there has scarcely been a case of fever\r\n  in the winter season when the pools are overflowed, and the atmosphere\r\n  is colder, and consequently unfavourable to fermentation and\r\n  decomposition. In my opinion the only method to remedy this evil would\r\n  be to drain the common, which is small, and its situation being\r\n  elevated, would greatly facilitate its drainage. The condition of a\r\n  few of the smaller and more confined of the tenements might be greatly\r\n  improved.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. L. Reynolds_, one of the medical officers of the Dore union, thus\r\ndescribes in his report the district where some fever cases occurred:—\r\n\r\n  “Of those cases the six first have occurred on Colston Common, a small\r\n  marshy spot, never drained, and containing several pools extremely\r\n  unhealthy, from decaying vegetables that never are removed. This year\r\n  the same families have been again attacked, and shall be so every year\r\n  till that nuisance be removed. In a medical point of view, such\r\n  commons are injurious, and they are extremely expensive to the unions,\r\n  for they cause fever, asthma, and rheumatism, from their incipient\r\n  moisture, thus injuring the labouring classes, and heavily taxing the\r\n  parish.\r\n\r\n  “The four next have occurred at a place called Toad Ditch: it well\r\n  deserves the name; it is a collection of badly-built houses, rendered\r\n  unhealthy from the large ditch, into which every kind of refuse is\r\n  poured; the removal of that nuisance is imperatively called for. All\r\n  these houses have one privy in common, but the ditch is the place\r\n  generally used.\r\n\r\n  “This district would be much served by enclosing and draining Colston\r\n  Commons, by keeping the sewers at Kingston clean, and by draining the\r\n  ditch at Toad Ditch. These are the only removable nuisances of which I\r\n  have any knowledge.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Blick_, medical officer of the Bicester union, describes the\r\nprevalence of typhus:—\r\n\r\n  “This disease has been very prevalent in this district during the past\r\n  year, indeed we are never free from it. I think its origin may be\r\n  traced, in most instances, to a constant exposure to an atmosphere\r\n  loaded with malaria, and propagated, in the second place, by\r\n  contagion, so little attention being paid to prevent its diffusion.\r\n\r\n  “The malaria alluded to arises from the decomposition of vegetable\r\n  matter left upon Otmoor (a marsh of about 4000 acres), by the previous\r\n  winter’s flood, and acted upon by the sun, &c., during the summer.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. J. Holt_, the medical officer of the Leighton Buzzard union,\r\nreports:—\r\n\r\n  “I have had only 34 cases of remittent and intermittent fevers during\r\n  the last year, which is a small number in comparison to the amount\r\n  usually occurring in hot summers. The great prevalence of these fevers\r\n  at such times is attributable principally to the number of stagnant\r\n  ponds and ditches which are situated in the very midst of many of the\r\n  towns and villages of this union, and which, in hot weather, become\r\n  quite putrid and offensive from the quantity of decaying animal and\r\n  vegetable matter. I have generally observed that the greater number of\r\n  these fevers occur in houses situated in the immediate vicinity of\r\n  these ponds, and have no doubt is the chief cause of nearly all the\r\n  fevers of this description. The villages to which I more particularly\r\n  refer are Egginton, Eddlesbon, Cheddington, &c.”\r\n\r\nThe sanitary effects of road cleansing, to which house drainage and road\r\ndrainage is auxiliary, it appears is not confined to the streets in\r\ntowns and the roads in villages, but extends over the roads at a\r\ndistance from habitations on which there is traffic. Dr. Harrison, whose\r\ntestimony has been cited on the subject of the analogy of the diseases\r\nof animals to those which affect the human constitution, in treating of\r\nthe prevention of fever or the rot amongst sheep, warns the shepherd\r\nthat, if after providing drained pasture and avoiding “rotting-places”\r\nin the fields, all his care may be frustrated if he do not avoid, with\r\nequal care, leading the sheep over wet and miry roads with stagnant\r\nditches, which are as pernicious as the places in the fields designated\r\nas “rotting-places.” He is solicitous to impress the fact that the rot,\r\n_i. e._ the typhus fever, has been contracted in ten minutes, that sheep\r\ncan at “any time be tainted in a quarter of an hour, while the land\r\nretains its moisture and the weather is hot and sultry.” He gives the\r\nfollowing instance, amongst others, of the danger of traversing badly\r\ndrained roads. “A gentleman removed 90 sheep from a considerable\r\ndistance to his own residence. On coming near to a bridge, which is\r\nthrown over the Barling’s river, one of the drove fell into a ditch and\r\nfractured its leg. The shepherd immediately took it in his arms to a\r\nneighbouring house, and set the limb. During this time, which did not\r\noccupy more than one hour, the remainder were left to graze in the\r\nditches and lane. The flock were then driven home, and a month\r\nafterwards the other sheep joined its companions. The shepherd soon\r\ndiscovered that all had contracted the rot, except the lame sheep; and\r\nas they were never separated on any other occasion, it is reasonable to\r\nconclude that the disorder was acquired by feeding in the road and ditch\r\nbottoms.” The precautions applicable to the sheep and cattle will be\r\ndeemed equally applicable to the labouring population who traverse such\r\nroads.\r\n\r\nSuch instances as the following, on the prejudicial effects of undrained\r\nand neglected roads, might be multiplied. _Mr. E. P. Turner_, the\r\nmedical officer of Foleshill union, in accounting for some cases of\r\nfever, states:—\r\n\r\n  “These cases of typhus all occurred in the same neighbourhood, where\r\n  the road is bad and a dirty ditch of stagnant water on each side of\r\n  it; the road is generally overflowed in the winter. The disease broke\r\n  out in the month of October; other cases occurred in the same\r\n  neighbourhood at the time.”\r\n\r\nThe nature of the more common impediments which stand in the way of the\r\nremoval of the causes of disease and obstacles to production described\r\nin the preceding, are noticed in the instances following. Others will be\r\nadduced when the subject of the legislative means of prevention are\r\nstated.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Traves_, on the sanitary condition of the poor in the Malton union,\r\nstates,—\r\n\r\n  “The whole of the low district above alluded to, and extending into\r\n  the Pickering union, (known by the name of the Marishes, or Marshes,)\r\n  has at different times within the last few years been the seat of\r\n  typhus and other fevers.\r\n\r\n  “Attempts were made by some of the landed proprietors a few years ago\r\n  to effect a system of drainage and embankments likely to prevent the\r\n  inundations of these rivers in wet seasons, but the attempt was\r\n  abandoned in consequence of the reluctance of certain townships to\r\n  bear their portion of the necessary outlay, and any partial system of\r\n  embankment is positively injurious, inasmuch as the water that is let\r\n  in upon the land at a higher point of the river is prevented returning\r\n  into the stream again by an embankment at a lower point, so that this\r\n  water, containing vegetable matters in a state of decomposition, must\r\n  remain stagnant until evaporated by the sun’s rays, or dissipated by\r\n  the wind; cases of fever occurring under these circumstances have\r\n  repeatedly come under my observation, as well as that of other medical\r\n  men familiar with the district, and this fruitful source of disease\r\n  (in seasons like 1839 more especially) will probably now remain in\r\n  full force until an Act of the legislature shall effect a change.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Thomas Marjoribanks_, the minister of Lochmaben,—\r\n\r\n  “No means of any consequence, so far as I am aware, have yet been\r\n  tried to remedy the evil, the removal of such substances as generate\r\n  malaria. There are no scavengers appointed for the removal of\r\n  nuisances. One great mean of preventing the generation of malaria (in\r\n  my opinion) would be the lowering of the bed of the river Annan, which\r\n  would to a great extent free the surrounding lands of stagnant water,\r\n  give greater facilities for draining, improve the system of farming,\r\n  lessen the risk of damage, and increase the quantity as well as\r\n  improve the quality of the food which the low lands produce, and in\r\n  every way conduce to the comfort and cleanliness of the inhabitants.\r\n  It is computed that in consequence of the flooding of the Annan,\r\n  damage during the last four years has been done to the amount of\r\n  6,000_l._, and this along only about three miles of its course. The\r\n  property is very much subdivided, and, in consequence, poverty and\r\n  want has increased to a great extent among the small proprietors.”\r\n\r\nIn closing this exposition of the state of the chief external evils that\r\naffect the sanitary condition of the labouring population, it may be\r\nobserved that the experience, on which the conclusions rest as to the\r\nprinciples of prevention is neither recent nor confined to this country.\r\nThat which is new, is the advantages we possess beyond other times, and\r\nperhaps beyond all other countries, in capital and practical science for\r\nits application. The experience of the advantage of public sewers to the\r\nhealth of a town population is nearly as old as Rome itself. I may refer\r\nwith M. Du Châtelet to the experience of that city, to illustrate the\r\nconsequences of neglects, such as are manifest amidst large masses of\r\nthe community throughout the country, and are partially displayed in the\r\nmortuary registers first cited. He gives the details from the treatise\r\n_De Adventitiis Romani Cœli Qualitatibus_, by the celebrated Italian\r\nphysician Lancisi, who deeply studied the sanitary condition of Rome,\r\nand wrote several admirable works on the subject, which had the happy\r\neffect of inducing the pope to cleanse and drain the city:—\r\n\r\n  “The barbarians of every tribe having several times pillaged and\r\n  sacked the city of Rome, the aqueducts were destroyed, and the water,\r\n  spreading into the surrounding plains, formed marshes, which\r\n  contributed greatly to render uninhabitable the surrounding country.\r\n\r\n  “The aqueducts existing no longer, the sewers and privies were alike\r\n  neglected, and produced serious and frequent sicknesses, which were\r\n  more effectual in destroying the population than the arms of the\r\n  barbarians. All the historians of these remote times, and particularly\r\n  St. Gregory, in his Homilies, and the deacon John, in the Life of that\r\n  saint, give a frightful picture of the city of Rome. The air became so\r\n  vitiated that plagues and fevers of a malignant character continually\r\n  carried on their ravages to such a point that Peter Damien, writing in\r\n  the eleventh century to Pope Nicholas II., to intreat him to accept\r\n  his resignation, alleged as the pretext the danger he ran every\r\n  instant of losing his life by remaining in the town.\r\n\r\n  “It was principally during the abode of the popes at Avignon that all\r\n  which regards health was neglected at Rome, and some historians have\r\n  not hesitated to attribute to this negligence the depopulation of the\r\n  town, which was reduced in a little time to 30,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\n  “Things remained in this state to the end of the fourteenth century,\r\n  an epoch at which the popes, resuming the ancient labours, restored\r\n  things to their proper condition; a new title to glory of Leo X., who\r\n  of all the popes was the one who occupied himself with this important\r\n  object in the most especial manner.\r\n\r\n  “It is, in part, to these precautions that we are to attribute the\r\n  rapid increase of the population of Rome, which, from 30,000 souls,\r\n  reached in a short time to 80,000; and it is a thing worthy of our\r\n  attention that after the death of this pontiff the population quickly\r\n  fell to the number of 32,000, because, according to the contemporary\r\n  authors, everything having been neglected, the first calamities were\r\n  renewed.\r\n\r\n  “Happily for Rome this state of things did not continue long, because\r\n  all successive popes, instructed, it appears, by the experience of\r\n  ancient times, having carried on immense labours, and constructed\r\n  fresh sewers, have given to the air of this city the necessary\r\n  purity.”\r\n\r\nItaly presents instances, though comparatively modern, of the removal of\r\ndisease by land drainage:—\r\n\r\n  “At Vareggio,” observes M. Villermé, “in the principality of Lucca,\r\n  the inhabitants, few in number, barbarous, and miserable, were\r\n  annually, from time immemorial, attacked about the same period with\r\n  agues; but in 1741 flood-gates were constructed, which permitted the\r\n  escape into the sea of the waters from the marshes, preventing at the\r\n  same time the ingress of the ocean to these marshes both from tides\r\n  and storms. This contrivance, which permanently suppressed the marsh,\r\n  also expelled the fevers. In short, the canton of Vareggio is at the\r\n  present day one of the healthiest, most industrious, and richest on\r\n  the coast of Tuscany; and a part of those families whose boorish\r\n  ancestors sunk under the epidemics of the _aria cativa_, without\r\n  knowledge to protect themselves, enjoy a health, a vigour, a\r\n  longevity, and a moral character unknown to their ancestors.”\r\n\r\nThe histories of other cities, and particularly of Paris, afford\r\nillustrations of the effects of the neglect of public cleansing, which\r\nbegin in the ignorance and carelessness of the superior officers, and\r\ncontinue in the predominance of ignorance and obscure interests of a\r\nmultitude in the present day:—\r\n\r\n  “For several years the suppression of an enormous cesspool at Paris\r\n  near the Barrière des Fourneaux was implored by the inhabitants.\r\n  Placed under the predominant winds, it was a permanent cause of\r\n  annoyance to the quarters of St. Germain and St. Jacques. But all\r\n  petitions were in vain. A singular occurrence brought about the event\r\n  for which the people had prayed more than 50 years. In a hunting\r\n  party, the Prince of Conde was carried by a fiery horse towards this\r\n  same cesspool; finding it impossible to turn the animal, the prince\r\n  had the presence of mind to throw himself on the ground, but the horse\r\n  darted forward into the cesspool and disappeared. The next day an\r\n  order was issued from Versailles, enjoining M. Lenoir, the lieutenant\r\n  of police, to fill up the cesspool, which was accordingly done.”\r\n\r\nA particular evil had attracted the attention of an able minister, who\r\nhad recourse to the expedient which we have seen recently re-discovered\r\nand introduced into practice into one section of the sewerage of\r\nLondon:—\r\n\r\n  “The great sewer of Montmartre being uncovered, and the fall\r\n  exceedingly small, it was easily choked, and spread infection through\r\n  all the neighbourhood. Turgot thought that the best method to obtain a\r\n  ready flow for the muddy waters it received was to wash it by frequent\r\n  currents. A vast reservoir, capable of containing about 22,000\r\n  measures of water, was in consequence established at the opening of\r\n  the sewer, opposite the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire. The waters of\r\n  Belleville were conducted there, together with those of two wells dug\r\n  in the vicinity. This volume of water was, on certain days, let into\r\n  the main sewer by means of flood-gates, which could be opened at\r\n  pleasure. The scouring of the sewer by a current of living water\r\n  attracted the public attention, and produced the most happy results.\r\n  Shortly the people could dwell on the confines of this ancient ditch\r\n  without fear of dangerous exhalations. The quarters of the Faubourg\r\n  Montmartre, of the Chaussée-d’Antin, of the Ville-l’Evêque, and of the\r\n  Faubourg St. Honoré, became populated. At length the land was so\r\n  valuable in these different quarters that the possessors of the banks\r\n  of the sewer demanded and obtained the permission to cover it over at\r\n  their own expense.”\r\n\r\nThe mode of cleansing had, however, been before proposed by another\r\nminister:—\r\n\r\n  “In the conferences which were held in 1666 and 1667 at the house of\r\n  the Chancellor Seguier respecting the grand police of the kingdom, a\r\n  thorough examination was made of the sewers of Paris, which began to\r\n  multiply. The minutes of these sittings still exist. We see there the\r\n  opinions given on the subject by each of the members of the\r\n  commission, and particularly by Colbert, who in the sitting of the\r\n  13th of January, proposed, as the best method of cleansing the sewers,\r\n  to establish several fountains in the quarters where they were\r\n  necessary, and at the side of each of them a reservoir of 15 measures,\r\n  which should be let out all at once. Nothing, assuredly, could be\r\n  better than this proposition. But one thing was wanting to the\r\n  minister—the water could not be procured.”\r\n\r\nBut the water, though abundant in the vicinity of Paris, is still\r\nwanted, and the cause of the want is thus noticed by M. Du Châtelet:—\r\n\r\n  “Paris possesses an immense mass of water, which can be distributed\r\n  into every quarter and every house. Does the demand multiply with the\r\n  pipes? Assuredly not, and one might well be surprised to see the\r\n  negligence and apathy of proprietors in this respect. Some persons\r\n  adduce the fact to prove that seven litres[12] of water are sufficient\r\n  for the inhabitants of Paris, whilst sixty are necessary for London,\r\n  and still more for Edinburgh. But if we look closer to the conduct of\r\n  the proprietors, we shall find that it proceeds from calculations well\r\n  understood. It is the certainty that they will have sooner to empty\r\n  the cesspools which scares them. This operation, and the expense it\r\n  often brings with it, influences the venal propensities of the\r\n  proprietors. Is it likely that they will pay for water of which the\r\n  inevitable result will be to multiply the number of operations they\r\n  dread the most, and which increase the expense in an enormous\r\n  proportion? Thus the actual state of our cesspools, and the mode of\r\n  emptying them now in use, are, in our opinion, the principal causes\r\n  which prevent individuals from taking the water, and which retard the\r\n  period in which the city will receive the interest of the enormous\r\n  sums that it has devoted, and still devotes daily, to the supply of\r\n  water.”\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped, however, that the legislature will give the powers\r\nand direct the means requisite in this country, to furnish to every city\r\nin Europe a practical demonstration that by the art of the engineer, the\r\nobstacle to improvement, formed by the great expense and annoyance of\r\nremoving the refuse of houses and streets may be rendered\r\ninconsiderable. In Paris the interests of turbulent bodies of men, the\r\nwater-carriers, and another class of men called the chiffonniers, who\r\nlive by raking for what they can find amongst the refuse cast into the\r\nstreets, are opposed to any change which will reduce the charge of\r\nimperfect cleansing, and the disease promoted by filth. The general\r\npractice in that metropolis is to cast all the rubbish of the house into\r\nthe street on the overnight, or before seven o’clock in the morning,\r\nwhen men attend with carts to sweep it up and remove it. In the\r\nnighttime, however, the chiffonnier comes with a lantern and rakes\r\namongst the refuse, and picks from it bones, rags, or whatever may have\r\nbeen thrown away by accident, or the carelessness of the servants. The\r\noffensive filth of their persons and their occupation, makes them\r\noutcasts from other classes of workmen; they sleep amidst their\r\ncollections of refuse, and they are idle during the day; they are like\r\nall men who live under such circumstances, prone to indulgence in ardent\r\nspirits; being degraded and savage, they are ready to throw away their\r\nwretched lives on every occasion. There are nearly 2000 of the\r\nchiffonniers alone in Paris, and they and the water-carriers were\r\nconspicuous actors in the revolution of 1830. During the administration\r\nof Casimir Perrier the householders had complained of the inconvenient\r\nmode of cleansing the streets by large heavy carts drawn by three\r\nhorses, which, during their slow progress throughout the day, obstruct\r\nthe public thoroughfares and occasion great inconveniences, especially\r\nin the narrow streets.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the year 1834, when the cholera broke out, the\r\nattention of the authorities was directed to sanitary measures, and the\r\nmunicipality decided that the cleansing of the streets should be done by\r\ncontract, by a quick relay of carts of a smaller and more convenient\r\nshape, drawn by single horses; and in order to diminish the\r\ninconvenience of the presence of these improved vehicles, the contractor\r\nwas allowed to collect one load for each of his carts on the overnight,\r\nwhich would have led to a practice similar to that of London, where the\r\ndust-carts take the refuse direct from the house without any deposit in\r\nthe streets. But in this arrangement an important interest had been\r\noverlooked; the chiffonniers, who were said to have been aided and\r\ndirected by the owners and men belonging to the superseded vehicles,\r\nrose in revolt, attacked and drove away the conductors, broke to pieces\r\nthe new carts, threw the fragments into the river, or made bonfires with\r\nthem. Unfortunately at that time the cholera had broken out at Paris.\r\nThe mobs of chiffonniers which collected on the following day were\r\nswollen by other crowds of ignorant, terrified, and savage people, who\r\nwere persuaded that the deaths from the strange plague were occasioned\r\nby poison. “My agents,” says the then prefet of police, in an account of\r\nthis revolt, “could not be at all points at once, to oppose the fury of\r\nthose crowds of men with naked arms and haggard figures, and sinister\r\nlooks, who are never seen in ordinary times, and who seemed on this day\r\nto have arisen out of the earth. Wishing to judge myself of the\r\nfoundation for the alarming reports that were brought to me, I went out\r\nalone and on foot. I had great difficulty in getting through these dense\r\nmasses, scarcely covered with filthy rags; no description could convey\r\ntheir hideous aspect, or the sensation of terror which the hoarse and\r\nferocious cries created. Although I am not easily moved, I at one time\r\nfeared for the safety of Paris—of honest people and their property.” In\r\nfact the riot was one of the most dangerous that had been witnessed in\r\nthat city, and it was not suppressed without great exertions and some\r\nloss of life. The anxieties which it occasioned to the minister, Casimir\r\nPerrier, and his disgust at the political use made of it, were\r\nconsidered to have contributed to his death. He was himself attacked\r\nwith the cholera, and died a few days after. Shortly before his death,\r\nwhen expressing his disgust, he said to the prefet, “My friend, we are\r\nharnessed to a vile carriage.” “Truly so,” replied the prefet, “and the\r\nways are dreadfully dirty.” The material ways of the city continued as\r\nthey were, the prefet seeing that the introduction of the new carts\r\nbecame “a motive to discontent and collision,” took upon himself to set\r\naside the contract with the contractor, who, he states, received no\r\nother compensation for his losses than a permission which he could not\r\nuse to collect the refuse during the day, and the chiffonniers continue\r\nto the present time in the exercise of their wretched vocation at the\r\nexpense of the public health and cleanliness.\r\n\r\nThe course of the present inquiry shows how strongly circumstances that\r\nare governable govern the habits of the population, and in some\r\ninstances appear almost to breed the species of the population.\r\nConceiving it probable that the amount of filth left by defective\r\ncleansing had its corresponding description of persons, I made inquiries\r\nof the Commissioners of Metropolitan Police. From returns which they\r\nobtained from their superintendents, it appears that of the class of\r\nbone-pickers, mud-rakers, people living on the produce of dungheaps in\r\nmews, courts, yards, and bye lanes insufficient cleansed, 598 are known\r\nto the police. From an observation of the proportion of filthy children\r\nand adults who appear amidst refuse whenever there are new buildings and\r\nan unusual quantity of rubbish, and from other circumstances, I believe\r\nthat, were the refuse of houses daily cast into the streets in London in\r\nthe same manner as at Paris, London would soon have as large and as\r\ndangerous a population of the chiffonnier class. I am informed by Sir\r\nCharles Shaw, the chief commissioner of police at Manchester, that there\r\nare 302 of them known within the police jurisdiction of that town also.\r\nHe complains that they have heretofore been licensed in their\r\noccupation; that, the children are pilferers, and occupy the attention\r\nof the police, and furnish a large quota to the stock of juvenile\r\ndelinquents and the population of the prisons. I am informed that in\r\nBath there are about 100 of them known; and in other towns and places I\r\nhave little doubt that they would be found in like proportions, which\r\napproach the proportions of the stated numbers of chiffonniers to the\r\npopulation of Paris. These degraded creatures are also found amongst the\r\ninmates of the workhouses, and the close identity of their habits with\r\nthose of the chiffonniers of Paris afford a striking proof of the\r\nsimilarity of the population produced by similarity of circumstances.\r\nThey are thus described to me by an eye-witness:—\r\n\r\n  “The bone-pickers are the dirtiest of all the inmates of our\r\n  workhouse; I have seen them take a bone from a dungheap, and gnaw it\r\n  while reeking hot with the fermentation of decay. Bones, from which\r\n  the meat had been cut raw, and which had still thin strips of flesh\r\n  adhering to them, they scraped carefully with their knives, and put\r\n  the bits, no matter how befouled with dirt, into a wallet or pocket\r\n  appropriated to the purpose. They have told me, that whether in broth\r\n  or grilled, they were the most savoury dish that could be imagined. I\r\n  have not observed that these creatures were savage, but they were\r\n  thoroughly debased. Often hardly human in appearance, they had neither\r\n  human tastes nor sympathies, nor even human sensations, for they\r\n  revelled in the filth which is grateful to dogs, and other lower\r\n  animals, and which to our apprehension is redolent only of nausea and\r\n  abomination.”\r\n\r\nThe following report from one of the superintendents to the\r\nCommissioners of the Metropolitan Police describes the manner in which\r\nthey appear to the police, their moral character, and the efficacy of\r\nthe means of prevention:—\r\n\r\n  “With reference to the question of the Commissioners as to the means\r\n  of subsistence of that portion of the population which at present\r\n  exists by picking bones in the bye-lanes, &c., in the event of those\r\n  places being properly cleansed, I am of opinion that they would be\r\n  compelled to adopt some more laborious and useful means of obtaining a\r\n  livelihood, such as field labour, &c. They are at present an idle,\r\n  dissolute class, prowling about the stables, yards, backs of premises,\r\n  and lanes, willing to commit petty felony wherever opportunity\r\n  presents itself. While it would remove them, on the other hand, the\r\n  instant removal of filth from the metropolis must prove beneficial to\r\n  the health of the inhabitants.”\r\n\r\nIt will then be found to be an ultimately beneficial effect of the\r\nremoval of the circumstances by the adoption of such modes of cleansing\r\nas diminish the prevalent amount of filth or filthy processes, that it\r\nwill force a change to other occupations of a less degrading character,\r\nand diminish the number of persons “brought up” to them. Any provision\r\nof the nature of a poor law may be said to be badly constructed which\r\ndoes not allow the exercise of a discretionary authority to alleviate\r\nany severe inconveniences to the poorest classes from such changes. For\r\nthe sake of preventing the growth of the like misery, it would probably\r\nbe found a good civic economy to maintain the whole of the existing\r\nclass in idleness, if idleness were not in itself a curse to them. I\r\nmention this, because the parish officers frequently oppose improved\r\nmodes of paving and efficient cleansing, (as they generally opposed the\r\nnew police on the ground that it diminished the means of subsistence of\r\ndecrepit old men as watchmen,) for the avowed reason that it is\r\nexpedient to keep the streets in their present state of filth in order\r\nto keep up the means of employing indigent persons as street-sweepers\r\nand sweepers of crossings in removing it.\r\n\r\nIt is found in the metropolis to be a beneficial result of the increase\r\nof the practice of removing night-soil by the self-acting process of\r\nwater-closets communicating with the sewers, that it prevents the\r\nincrease of the number of nightmen formerly requisite for the\r\nperformance of that offensive and dangerous labour, and is in the\r\nmetropolis diminishing the number.\r\n\r\nYet it should be borne in mind, that until more complete measures are\r\nadopted, even the services of such agents are an improvement, and in\r\ncrowded cities are only neglected at the expense of the degradation of\r\nthe whole mass of the labouring population. An example is to be found in\r\nthe state of some districts mentioned by _Dr. Speer_, who in his account\r\nof the diseases of the lower orders in Dublin, given in the Dublin\r\nHospital Reports, noticed the fact that the fever cases always came from\r\nthe filthy districts; and he observes,\r\n\r\n  “We cannot wonder at the rapidity with which contagion often spreads.\r\n  Both in and out of doors, it seems facilitated in every way; within\r\n  doors every article of furniture and wearing apparel is disfigured\r\n  with filth; every spot seems encrusted with its layers, and the\r\n  foulest odours abound everywhere. Out of doors, at least in warm\r\n  seasons, our churchyards, slaughter-houses, and the masses of filth\r\n  and offal with which our streets and lanes are disgraced, contribute\r\n  no less to the propagation of contagion. In the larger and better\r\n  streets, the cleansing is very well attended to, but in the narrow and\r\n  crowded ones, where the necessity of its removal is infinitely\r\n  greater, the heaps of filth are truly disgraceful. In some of my\r\n  visits I have been obliged to wade through masses of filth enough to\r\n  sicken the stoutest and strongest—masses which have remained\r\n  undisturbed for months, perhaps for years, and thus generating the\r\n  most putrid effluvia. We know that vegetables are very dear in our\r\n  markets. Why? Because our gardens are not sufficiently manured; this\r\n  manure lies in our lanes and alleys, and only wants collecting; but\r\n  what would this be compared with the benefits from the purification of\r\n  our atmosphere which its removal would produce?”\r\n\r\nThe condition of large rural districts in the immediate vicinity of the\r\ntowns, and of the poorest districts of the towns themselves, presents a\r\nsingular contrast in the nature of the agencies by which the health of\r\nthe inhabitants is impaired. Within the towns we find the houses and\r\nstreets filthy, the air fœtid, disease, typhus, and other epidemics rife\r\namongst the population, bringing, in the train, destitution and the need\r\nof pecuniary as well as medical relief; all mainly arising from the\r\npresence of the richest materials of production, the complete absence of\r\nwhich would, in a great measure, restore health, avert the recurrence of\r\ndisease, and, if properly applied, would promote abundance, cheapen\r\nfood, and increase the demand for beneficial labour. Outside the\r\nafflicted districts, and at a short distance from them, as in the\r\nadjacent rural districts, we find the aspect of the country poor and\r\nthinly clad with vegetation, except rushes and plants favoured by a\r\nsuperabundance of moisture, the crops meagre, the labouring agricultural\r\npopulation few, and afflicted with rheumatism and other maladies,\r\narising from damp and an excess of water, which, if removed, would\r\nrelieve them from a cause of disease, the land from an impediment to\r\nproduction, and if conveyed for the use of the town population, would\r\ngive that population the element of which they stand in peculiar need,\r\nas a means to relieve them from that which is their own cause of\r\ndepression, and return it for use on the land as a means of the highest\r\nfertility. The fact of the existence of these evils, and that they are\r\nremovable is not more certain than that their removal would be attended\r\nby reductions of existing burdens, and might be rendered productive of\r\ngeneral advantage, if due means, guided by science, and applied by\r\nproperly qualified officers, be resorted to. The impediments arising\r\nfrom the existing state of the law and of its local administration, form\r\na subject for separate representation.\r\n\r\nBefore stating the cost in life and money attributable to the noxious\r\ncauses external to the dwelling, it is desirable to notice other noxious\r\ncauses, within the recognised province of legislative interference, that\r\nappear to be similarly under control, namely, the overcrowding of places\r\nwhere large numbers are assembled together, such as the overcrowding of\r\nplaces of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n III.—CIRCUMSTANCES CHIEFLY IN THE INTERNAL ECONOMY AND BAD VENTILATION\r\nOF PLACES OF WORK; WORKMEN’S LODGING-HOUSES, DWELLINGS, AND THE DOMESTIC\r\n         HABITS AFFECTING THE HEALTH OF THE LABOURING CLASSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evils arising from the bad ventilation of places of work will\r\nprobably be most distinctly brought to view, by the consideration of the\r\nevidence as to its effects on one particular class of workpeople.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of cases of early deaths, and orphanage, and widowhood\r\namongst one class of labourers, the journeymen tailors, led me to make\r\nsome inquiries as to the causes affecting them; and I submit the\r\nfollowing evidence for peculiar consideration, as an illustration of the\r\noperation of one predominant cause;—bad ventilation or overcrowding, and\r\nthe consequences on the moral habits, the loss of healthful existence\r\nand happiness to the labourer, the loss of profit to the employer, and\r\nof produce to the community, and the loss in expenditure for the relief\r\nof the destitution, which original cause (the bad ventilation) we have\r\nhigh scientific authority for stating to be easily and economically\r\ncontrollable.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Thomas Brownlow_, tailor, aged 52:—\r\n\r\n  “It is stated that you have been a journeyman tailor, and now work for\r\n  yourself. At what description of places have you worked?—I have always\r\n  worked at the largest places in London; one part of my time I worked\r\n  at Messrs Allen’s, of Old Bond-street, where I worked eight years; at\r\n  another part of my time I worked at Messrs. Stultze’s, in\r\n  Clifford-street, where I worked four years. At Messrs. Allen’s they\r\n  had then from 80 to 100 men at work; at Messrs. Stultze’s they had,\r\n  when I worked there, about 250 men.\r\n\r\n  “Will you describe the places of work, and the effects manifested in\r\n  the health of the workmen?—The place in which we used to work at\r\n  Messrs. Allen’s was a room where 80 men worked together. It was a room\r\n  about 16 or 18 yards long, and 7 or 8 yards wide, lighted with\r\n  skylights; the men were close together, nearly knee to knee. In summer\r\n  time the heat of the men and the heat of the irons made the room 20 or\r\n  30 degrees higher than the heat outside; the heat was then most\r\n  suffocating, especially after the candles were lighted. I have known\r\n  young men, tailors from the country, faint away in the shop from the\r\n  excessive heat and closeness; persons, working-men, coming into the\r\n  shop to see some of the men, used to complain of the heat, and also of\r\n  the smell as intolerable; the smell occasioned by the heat of the\r\n  irons and the various breaths of the men really was at times\r\n  intolerable. The men sat as loosely as they possibly could, and the\r\n  perspiration ran from them from the heat and the closeness. It is of\r\n  frequent occurrence in such workshops that light suits of clothes are\r\n  spoiled from the perspiration of the hand, and the dust and flue which\r\n  arises darkening the work. I have seen 40_l._ or 50_l._ worth of work\r\n  spoiled in the course of the summer season from this cause.\r\n\r\n  “In what condition are these work-places in winter?—They are more\r\n  unhealthy in winter, as the heat from the candles and the closeness is\r\n  much greater. Any cold currents of air which come in give annoyance to\r\n  those who are sitting near the draught. There is continued squabbling\r\n  as to the windows being opened; those who are near the windows, and\r\n  who do not feel the heat so much as the men near the stoves, objecting\r\n  to their being opened. The oldest, who had been inured to the heat,\r\n  did not like the cold, and generally prevailed in keeping out the cold\r\n  or the fresh air. Such has been the state of the atmosphere, that in\r\n  the very coldest nights large thick tallow candles (quarter of a pound\r\n  candles) have melted and fallen over from the heat.\r\n\r\n  “What was the effect of this state of the work-places upon the habits\r\n  of the workmen?—It had a very depressing effect on the energies; that\r\n  was the general complaint of those who came into it. Many could not\r\n  stay out the hours, and went away earlier. Those who were not\r\n  accustomed to the places generally lost appetite. The natural effect\r\n  of the depression was, that we had recourse to drink as a stimulant.\r\n  We went into the shop at six o’clock in the morning; but at seven\r\n  o’clock when orders for the breakfast were called for, gin was brought\r\n  in, and the common allowance was half-a-quartern. The younger hands\r\n  did not begin with gin.\r\n\r\n  “Was gin the first thing taken before any solid food was taken?—Yes,\r\n  and the breakfast was very light; those who took gin generally took\r\n  only half-a-pint of tea and half a twopenny loaf as breakfast.\r\n\r\n  “When again was liquor brought in?—At eleven o’clock.\r\n\r\n  “What was taken then?—Some took beer, some took gin again. In a\r\n  general way, they took a pint of porter at eleven o’clock. It was\r\n  seldom the men took more than the half-quartern of gin.\r\n\r\n  “When again was liquor brought in?—At three o’clock, when some took\r\n  beer and some gin, just the same as in the morning. At five o’clock\r\n  the beer and gin came in again, and was usually taken in the same\r\n  quantities. At seven o’clock the shop was closed.\r\n\r\n  “After work was there any drinking?—Yes; nearly all the young men went\r\n  to the public-house, and some of the others.\r\n\r\n  “What were the wages they received?—Sixpence per hour, which, at the\r\n  full work, made 6s. a-day, or 36s. a-week.\r\n\r\n  “Did they make any reserves from this amount of wages?—No; very few\r\n  had anything for themselves at the end of the week.\r\n\r\n  “How much of the habit of drinking was produced by the state of the\r\n  work-place?—I should say the greater part of it; because when men work\r\n  by themselves, or only two or three together, in cooler and less close\r\n  places, there is scarcely any drinking between times. Nearly all this\r\n  drinking proceeds from the large shops, where the men are crowded\r\n  together in close rooms: it is the same in the shops in the country,\r\n  as well as those in the town. In a rural place, the tailor, where he\r\n  works by himself, or with only two or three together, takes very\r\n  little of the fermented liquor or spirits which the men feel\r\n  themselves under a sort of necessity for doing in towns. The closer\r\n  the ventilation of the place of work, the worse are the habits of the\r\n  men working in them.\r\n\r\n  “You referred to the practice of one large shop where you worked some\r\n  time since; was that the general practice, and has there been no\r\n  alteration?—It was and is now the general practice. Of late, since\r\n  coffee has become cheaper, somewhat more of coffee and less of beer\r\n  has been bought in; but there is as much gin now brought in between\r\n  times, and sometimes more.\r\n\r\n  “What would be the effect of an alteration of the place of work—a\r\n  ventilation which would give them a better atmosphere?—It would,\r\n  without doubt, have an immediately beneficial effect on the habits. It\r\n  might not cure those who have got into the habit of drinking; but the\r\n  men would certainly drink less, and the younger ones would not be led\r\n  into the habit so forcibly as they are.\r\n\r\n  “What is the general effect of this state of things upon the health of\r\n  the men exposed to them?—Great numbers of them die of consumption. “A\r\n  decline” is the general disease of which they die. By their own rules,\r\n  a man at 50 years of age is superannuated, and is thought not to be\r\n  fit to do a full day’s work.\r\n\r\n  “What was the average of the ages of the men at work at such shops as\r\n  those you have worked at?—Thirty-two, or thereabouts.\r\n\r\n  “In such shops were there many superannuated men, or men above 50\r\n  years of age?—Very few. Amongst the tailors employed in the shops, I\r\n  should say there were not 10 men in the hundred above 50 years of age.\r\n\r\n  “When they die, what becomes of their widows and children, as they\r\n  seldom make any reserve of wages?—No provision is made for the\r\n  families; nothing is heard of them, and, if they cannot provide for\r\n  themselves, they must go upon the parish.\r\n\r\n  “Are these habits created by the closeness of the rooms, attended by\r\n  carelessness as to their mode of living elsewhere?—I think not as to\r\n  their lodgings. The English and Scotch tailors are more careful as to\r\n  their places of lodging, and prefer sleeping in an open place. The\r\n  men, however, who take their pint of porter and their pipe of tobacco\r\n  in a public-house after their hours of work, take it at a place which\r\n  is sometimes as crowded as a shop. Here the single men will stay until\r\n  bedtime.\r\n\r\n  “Are gin and beer the only stimulants which you conceive are taken in\r\n  consequence of the want of ventilation and the state of the place of\r\n  work when crowded?—No: snuff is very much taken as a stimulant; the\r\n  men think snuff has a beneficial effect on the eyes. After going into\r\n  these close shops from the open air, the first sensation experienced\r\n  is frequently a sensation of drowsiness, then a sort of itching or\r\n  uneasiness at the eye, then a dimness of the sight. Some men of the\r\n  strongest sight will complain of this dimness; all eyes are affected\r\n  much in a similar manner. Snuff is much used as a stimulant to awaken\r\n  them up; smoking in the shops is not approved of, though it is much\r\n  attempted; and the journeymen tailors of the large shops are in\r\n  general great smokers at the public-houses.\r\n\r\n  “Do the tailors from villages take snuff or smoke as well as drink so\r\n  much as the tailors in the large shops in the towns?—They neither take\r\n  so much snuff nor tobacco, nor so much of any of the stimulants, as\r\n  are taken by the workmen in the crowded shops of the towns.\r\n\r\n  “Do their eyes fail them as soon?—No, certainly not.\r\n\r\n  “With the tailors, is it the eye that fails first?—Yes; after long\r\n  hours of work the first thing complained of by the tailors is that the\r\n  eyes fail; the sight becomes dim, and a sort of mist comes between\r\n  them and their work.\r\n\r\n  “Judging from your own practical experience, how long do you conceive\r\n  that a man would work in a well-ventilated or uncrowded room, as\r\n  compared with a close, crowded, ill-ventilated room?—I think it would\r\n  make a difference of two hours in the day to a man. He would, for\r\n  example, be able, in an uncrowded or well-ventilated room, to do his\r\n  twelve hours’ work in the twelve hours; whereas in the close-crowded\r\n  room he would not do more than ten hours’ work in the twelve.\r\n\r\n  “Of two men beginning at 20 years of age, what would be the difference\r\n  in extent of labour performed by them in town shops or in the\r\n  country?—A man who had begun at 20 in these crowded shops would not be\r\n  so good a man at 40 as a man working to 50 in a country village; of\r\n  the two, the country tailor would be in the best condition in health\r\n  and strength: in point of fact he is so. The difference may be set\r\n  down as a gain of 10 years’ good labour. There are very few who can\r\n  stand such work as the town shops 20 years.\r\n\r\n  “The eyes then become permanently injured, as well as fail during the\r\n  day, in these crowded shops?—Yes, they do. After 45 years of age, the\r\n  eyes begin to fail, and he cannot do a full day’s work.\r\n\r\n  “Supposing a workman to work in a well-ventilated room, and to be\r\n  freed from the nervous exhaustion consequent on the state of the\r\n  place, might he not save at least all that he drinks in the times\r\n  between his meals, or be enabled to apply it better, if he were so\r\n  disposed; and, perhaps, the value of the two hours’ extra work in the\r\n  12, when he is working piece-work?—Yes, certainly he might.\r\n\r\n  “Taking your account of the average loss by nervous exhaustion and bad\r\n  habits to be two hours’ work for 20 years, and 12 hours daily work for\r\n  10 years in addition, supposing him to be employed full time, it would\r\n  be a loss of the value of 50,000 hours of productive labour (of the\r\n  value at 6_d._ per hour, 1,250_l._); or, if he were only in work half\r\n  a-year, at a loss of 25,000 hours; so that if he were employed the\r\n  half time at the full wages, or full time at the half wages, such\r\n  workmen will have lost the means of putting by a sum of not less than\r\n  600_l._ to maintain him in comfort when he is no longer able to\r\n  work?—Yes, I think that would be found to be correct. Very few do\r\n  save; but I have known some save considerable sums. I knew one man, of\r\n  the name of John Hale, who saved about 600_l._ He was not one of the\r\n  most sober men, but he was in constant employment, sometimes at\r\n  Allen’s and sometimes at Weston’s, and he was very careful; but he\r\n  died when he was about 45. I knew another man, whose name was Philip\r\n  Gray, who used to prefer the smaller shops. He was a man of a very\r\n  good constitution, and he lived until he was about 70. He was a\r\n  journeyman all his life, and he had, when he died, more than\r\n  1,500_l._, all saved by London journey work. He used to live in a\r\n  baker’s shop in Silver-street, Golden-square.\r\n\r\n  “Was he of a penurious disposition?—He associated less with the men\r\n  than others, and they knew little about him. He was dressed much the\r\n  same as the rest, but he was much more clean in his person: he was\r\n  remarkable for his cleanliness, and he was very neat in his person.\r\n  Both he and Hale were single men.\r\n\r\n  “Can you doubt that, under favourable sanitary circumstances, such\r\n  instances would become frequent?—It cannot be doubted. I have known\r\n  other instances of saving, but those were not of men working on the\r\n  board: they were mostly of men who had situations in the\r\n  cutting-rooms.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. John Fowler_:—\r\n\r\n  “You are a tailor, are you not?—I have been all my life a journeyman\r\n  tailor, and worked in the metropolis; but I have long been\r\n  superannuated, and now act as collector to the Benevolent Institution\r\n  for the Relief of Aged and Infirm Tailors.\r\n\r\n  “That is supported by the masters, is it not?—Yes; the journeymen\r\n  tailors subscribe, but it is principally supported by masters, who\r\n  subscribe to it most liberally. Mr. Stultze, for example, has\r\n  subscribed 795_l._ in money, and is a yearly subscriber of 25 guineas.\r\n  He has made a present to the institution of the ground for the\r\n  erection of almshouses, worth about 1000_l._, and has undertaken to\r\n  build six houses at his own expense, for the reception of 20 poor\r\n  pensioners. The funds are about 11,000_l._, principally subscribed by\r\n  the masters.\r\n\r\n  “Have you belonged to any other society?—I was clerk to a trade\r\n  society, consisting of upwards of 500 men.\r\n\r\n  “Have you worked in the more crowded shops?—I have worked at Mr.\r\n  Allen’s, and Mr. William’s, of Conduit-street, which was a shop\r\n  containing about as many men as Mr. Allen’s. I have worked at other\r\n  shops, not so large as Mr. Allen’s.\r\n\r\n  “Have you read Mr. Brownlow’s evidence?—Yes, I have.\r\n\r\n  “How far do the facts generally coincide with your own\r\n  observations?—Generally they do. I agree with him as to the effects of\r\n  work in close workshops, and as to the time a man would last as a\r\n  workman, under the most favourable circumstances, in a well-ventilated\r\n  place. I do not think the drinking of gin was general, to the extent\r\n  he mentions; and I think the improvement as to drinking beer, as well\r\n  as spirits, is now very great; particularly in spirits, since tea and\r\n  coffee have been so much drank. Of late, as far as my knowledge\r\n  extends, there is very little beer-drinking in the afternoon. I knew\r\n  the individuals he mentions as having saved money, and I have known\r\n  many others do so too. Some of them have become opulent and\r\n  respectable masters, who were fellow-shopmen with me. I conceive that\r\n  the establishment of coffee-shops has been of great benefit to the\r\n  health and morals of the men: it has taken them from the public-house.\r\n  I have known a very large proportion of men carried off young, and in\r\n  middle life, by consumption; but, in general, irregular habits were\r\n  mixed up with the effects of the work in close places. The crowding of\r\n  the large shops must be considered as occurring only in the season.”\r\n\r\nThe following is the examination of a tailor in Marlborough, taken by\r\nMr. Grainger:—\r\n\r\n_Charles Dobson_, 58 years old,—\r\n\r\n  “Has been a tailor since he was 16 years old. Has always lived in the\r\n  country. Has two sons journeymen tailors, who have been employed in\r\n  London, one seven and the other five years. Formerly employed seven or\r\n  eight men, who worked with witness in a shop which was very close, so\r\n  that if there were nine men they could scarcely sit on the board.\r\n  Although there was very little drinking, they were so much oppressed\r\n  in the summer, and at other seasons when the candles were lighted,\r\n  that he has seen the men reel after getting off the board. Used\r\n  himself, when it was very warm, to feel faint. Attributes these\r\n  effects to the heat of the shop, arising from the closeness, the\r\n  stove, and the hot irons; also to the smell of the cloth and the\r\n  breath of the men. Latterly has worked with lower hands and in a more\r\n  open shop; finds his health better, and that he is not oppressed by\r\n  the work. Has often noticed in this town, where there are a few shops\r\n  containing, in the summer, 14 or 15 journeymen, that when men go into\r\n  them who have previously worked in the neighbouring villages, they\r\n  became pale and unhealthy-looking: attributes this to the heat. His\r\n  sons have complained to him that their health suffers from working in\r\n  large shops in London. Has seen many who have gone to London return\r\n  ‘looking far worse than when they went.’ From his experience, thinks\r\n  that a man may enjoy his health in this business, if he works moderate\r\n  hours and in an airy shop, where the number is small. Should consider\r\n  12 hours, allowing out of them one hour for dinner, moderate: these\r\n  are the common hours in this part of the country. Has known many men\r\n  who have worked in the neighbouring villages; they are generally quite\r\n  as healthy as other people, ‘does not see any difference.’ They are\r\n  more strong and not so chilly as those who work in shops. Has known\r\n  many upwards of 50, who were quite able to go on with the work; they\r\n  are only obliged to give it up from failure of sight as they advance\r\n  in age: ‘from nothing else.’ Knew one man in this town who went on\r\n  till he was 77. Has himself good health.”\r\n\r\nI have collected the evidence of several master tailors on the effects\r\nof work in crowded or bad ventilated rooms. Some are inclined to ascribe\r\nmore of the ill health to the habits of the journeymen in drinking at\r\npublic-houses, and to the state of their private dwellings, but in the\r\nmain results the loss of daily power—_i. e._, the loss of at least\r\none-third the industrial capabilities enjoyed by men working under\r\nadvantageous circumstances—the nervous exhaustion attendant on work in\r\ncrowds, and the consequent temptation to resort continually to\r\nstimulants, which in their turn increase the exhaustion, are fully\r\nproved, and indeed generally admitted. I have caused the mortuary\r\nregisters to be examined, but find that they do not distinguish the\r\nmasters from the journeymen, and that there are no ready means of\r\ndistinguishing those of the deceased who have been employed in the\r\nlarger shops. It is also stated that many who come to work in town and\r\nbecome diseased, return and die in the villages. But in the registered\r\ncauses of death of 233 persons entered during the year 1839 in the\r\neastern and western Unions of the metropolis, under the general head\r\n“tailor,” no less than 123 are registered as having died of disease of\r\nthe respiratory organs, of whom 92 died of consumption;[13] 16 of\r\ndiseases of the nervous system, of whom 8 died of apoplexy; 16 of\r\nepidemic or contagious diseases, of whom 11 died of typhus; 23 are\r\nregistered as having died of diseases of “uncertain seat,” of whom 13\r\nfell victims of dropsy; 8 died of diseases of the digestive organs, and\r\nsix of “heart disease;” and of the whole number of 233 only 29 of old\r\nage; and of these, if they could be traced, we may pronounce confidently\r\nthat the greater proportion of them would be found to be not journeymen,\r\nof whom not two or three per cent. attain old age, but masters. On\r\ncomparing the mortuary registers in the metropolis with the registers in\r\nnorth-western and the south-western parts of England, where we may\r\nexpect a larger proportion of men working separately, I find that whilst\r\n53 per cent. of the men die of diseases of the respiratory organs in the\r\nmetropolis, only 39 per cent. die of these diseases in the remote\r\ndistricts; that whilst five per cent. die. of typhus in London, only one\r\nper cent. fall victims to it in the country; that whilst in London only\r\n12 in the hundred attain old age, 25 in the hundred are registered as\r\nhaving attained it in the remote districts.\r\n\r\nIt is due to Messrs. Stultze, the employers mentioned by the first\r\nwitness, to state, that since he worked with them they have made\r\nconsiderable alterations with the view to increase the ventilation of\r\ntheir workshops, and have expressed their desire to adopt whatever\r\nimprovements may be pointed out to them.\r\n\r\nI have been informed, that some tailors’ workshops at Glasgow have been\r\ncarefully ventilated, and that the immediate results are as satisfactory\r\nas were anticipated, but the change has been too recent to permit any\r\nestimate of the effects on the general habits of the workmen.\r\n\r\nThe preceding case may serve as a general instance of the practical\r\ndifference of the effects in the saving of suffering as well as of\r\nexpense, by active benevolence exerted with foresight in measures of\r\nprevention, as compared with benevolence exerted in measures of\r\nalleviation of disease after it has occurred.\r\n\r\nThe subscriptions to the benevolent institution for the relief of the\r\naged and infirm tailors, by individual masters in the metropolis, appear\r\nto be large and liberal, and amount to upwards of 11,000_l._; yet it is\r\nto be observed, that if they or the men had been aware of the effects of\r\nvitiated atmospheres on the constitution and general strength, and of\r\nthe means of ventilation, the practicable gain of money from the gain of\r\nlabour by that sanitary measure could not have been less in one large\r\nshop, employing 200 men, than 100,000_l._ Independently of subscriptions\r\nof the whole trade, it would, during their working period of life, have\r\nbeen sufficient, with the enjoyment of greater health and comfort by\r\nevery workman during the time of work, to have purchased him an annuity\r\nof 1_l._ per week for comfortable and respectable self-support during a\r\nperiod of superannuation, commencing soon after _fifty_ years of age.\r\n\r\nOf that which in these instances appear to be the main cause of\r\npremature disease and death, defective ventilation, it is to be remarked\r\nthat until very lately little had been observed or understood, even by\r\nprofessional men or men of science; and that it is only when the public\r\nhealth is made a matter of public care by a responsible public agency\r\nthat, what is understood can be expected to be generally and effectually\r\napplied for the public protection. Vitiated air not being seen, and air\r\nwhich is pure in winter being cold, the cold is felt and the air is\r\nexcluded by the workmen. The great desideratum hitherto has been to\r\nobtain a circulation of air which was _warm_, as well as fresh. This\r\ndesideratum has been attained, after much trial, in the House of\r\nCommons; but there is reason to believe that, by various means, at an\r\nexpense within the reach certainly of large places of work, a\r\nventilation equally good might be secured with mutual advantage.\r\n\r\nThe effects of bad ventilation, it need not be pointed out, are chiefly\r\nmanifested in consumption, the disease by which the greatest slaughter\r\nis committed. The causes of fever are comparatively few and prominent,\r\nbut they appear to have a concurrent effect in producing consumption.\r\nThe investigation of the whole of the contributary causes to the\r\nproduction of the immense mass of mortality occasioned by that disease,\r\nwould be beyond the time or means allowed for the present inquiry; but\r\ndefective ventilation and defective management in respect to changes of\r\ntemperature, are causes everywhere apparent amongst the labouring\r\nclasses. The effects of good ventilation, as a single cause of the\r\nprevention or alleviation of disease, are nowhere so clearly manifest as\r\nin their effects on hospital treatment. What Dr. Bisset Hawkins states\r\nin respect to the sanitary measures necessary to ensure successful\r\ntreatment in hospitals, may be stated in respect to common dwellings as\r\nwell as places of work.\r\n\r\n  “Next to the influence of national causes, the mortality of hospitals\r\n  is most affected by position and internal economy. These circumstances\r\n  appear more powerful than even the various merits of practice; and,\r\n  happily for mankind, they are advantages of a definite nature, easily\r\n  comprehended, and, of late years, generally demanded. The case was\r\n  formerly very different, when a singular prejudice or indifference\r\n  existed in respect to ventilation. At the Leeds hospital no case of\r\n  compound fracture, nor of trepan, survived. At the Hôtel Dieu, of\r\n  Paris, compound fractures were also almost always fatal, and few\r\n  survived amputation. The system which will bear improper air with\r\n  impunity during health becomes keenly susceptible of its mischief when\r\n  diseased, and a change of air will often restore where the strictest\r\n  diet has failed. Mortality is seldom to be assigned to the influence\r\n  of bad practice, which, probably, does not often destroy life. An\r\n  accomplished friend made particular notes on the comparative mortality\r\n  under three physicians in the same hospital; one was expectant, one\r\n  tonic, and the other eclectic. The mortality was the same, but the\r\n  length of the disorder, the character of the convalescence, and the\r\n  chances of relapse were very different.\r\n\r\n  “The earliest statement which we possess of the mortality of our\r\n  hospitals is in Sir William Petty’s work on Political Arithmetic, from\r\n  which it appears, that in the year 1685 the proportion of the deaths\r\n  to the cures in St. Bartholomew’s and St. Thomas’s hospitals was about\r\n  1 to 7. The annual printed report of St. Thomas’s hospital for 1689 is\r\n  still preserved: the mortality was then about 1 in 10. During the ten\r\n  years from 1773 to 1783, the mortality at St Thomas’s became still\r\n  smaller, it was 1 in 14. About the year 1783, some improvements were\r\n  made with respect to cleanliness and ventilation, and during the ten\r\n  subsequent years the annual deaths were accordingly still fewer than\r\n  before, less than 1 in 15. During the ten years intervening between\r\n  1803 and 1813 the improvement continued, and the proportion fell to\r\n  only 1 in 16. The average during the 50 years from 1764 to 1813 was\r\n  remarkably small, only 1 in 15.”\r\n\r\n_Parent Du Chátelet_ notices in the following terms the diminution in\r\nthe mortality of the Hôtel Dieu from better ventilation:—\r\n\r\n  “The mortality has diminished in the Hôtel Dieu in remarkable\r\n  proportions. Without saying anything of the enlargement of the\r\n  windows, of the warm clothing, of a better system of heating the\r\n  apartments, are we to count for nothing the destruction of all the\r\n  high houses which surrounded the Hôtel Dieu on every side? In our\r\n  opinion the pure and dry air which circulates now in every part, the\r\n  sun which penetrates there, the stoves which have been erected, have\r\n  as much contributed to its healthiness as the suppression of the\r\n  amphitheatres of anatomy which were in its neighbourhood.”\r\n\r\nThe reports of other hospitals present similar and generally\r\ncorroborative experience. In the space of four years, ending in 1784, in\r\na badly-ventilated house, the Lying-in Hospital in Dublin, there died\r\n2,944 children out of 7,650; but after freer ventilation, the deaths in\r\nthe same period of time, and in a like number of children, amounted only\r\nto 279.\r\n\r\nOne effect of the attention given to the condition of the workers in the\r\nfactories has been, that ventilation has been extensively introduced,\r\nand with marked effects, on the condition of the workpeople. When I was\r\nat Glasgow a striking instance was pointed out to me of the beneficial\r\neffects of ventilation when applied to the dwellings of the working\r\nclasses connected with such establishments. I was informed there was in\r\nthat city an assemblage of dwellings for their workpeople, called, from\r\nits mode of construction and the crowd collected in it, the Barracks.\r\nThis building contained 500 persons; every room contained one family.\r\nThe consequences of this crowding of the apartments, which were badly\r\nventilated, and the filth were, that fever was scarcely ever absent from\r\nthe building. There were sometimes as many as seven cases in one day,\r\nand in the last two months of 1831 there were 57 cases in the building.\r\nAll attempts to induce the inmates to ventilate their rooms were\r\nineffectual, and the proprietors of the work, on the recommendation of\r\nMr. Fleming, a surgeon of the district, fixed a simple tin tube of two\r\ninches in diameter, into the ceiling of each room, and these tubes led\r\ninto one general tube, the extremity of which was inserted into the\r\nchimney of the factory furnace. By the perpetual draught thus produced\r\nupon the atmosphere of each room the inmates were compelled, whether\r\nthey would or not, to breathe pure air. The effect was that, during the\r\nensuing eight years, fever was scarcely known in the place. The process\r\nwas apparently defective only in not providing for the appropriate\r\nwarmth of the air introduced. The cost of remedies previously applied in\r\nthe public hospitals to the fever cases, continually produced as\r\ndescribed in the barracks, were stated by Dr. Cowan to have afforded a\r\nstriking contrast to the cost of the means of prevention.\r\n\r\nSimilar defective ventilation and overcrowding in rooms of work, with\r\nthe addition of the deterioration of the air by the use of candles or\r\ngas-lamps at night-work, produce similar effects on the milliners and\r\ndressmakers employed at the larger workshops of the metropolis. In a\r\nreturn of the causes of death to the milliners and dressmakers who died\r\nduring the year 1839, in the unions of the metropolis, in which we have\r\nno means of distinguishing those who worked separately or in small\r\nnumbers, the results were as follows:—\r\n\r\n       TABULAR STATEMENT of DEATHS from Disease of Milliners and\r\n    Dressmakers, in the Metropolitan Unions during the year 1839, as\r\n                    shown by the Mortuary Registers.\r\n\r\n  ┌───────────┬───────┬───────┬────────────┬───────┬─────────┬───────┐\r\n  │   Age.    │Number │Average│ Number of  │Average│Number of│Average│\r\n  │           │  of   │ Age.  │Deaths from │ Age.  │ Deaths  │ Age.  │\r\n  │           │Deaths.│       │Consumption.│       │  from   │       │\r\n  │           │       │       │            │       │  other  │       │\r\n  │           │       │       │            │       │  Lung   │       │\r\n  │           │       │       │            │       │Diseases.│       │\r\n  ├───────────┼───────┼───────┼────────────┼───────┼─────────┼───────┤\r\n  │   Under 20│      6│     17│           4│     18│         │       │\r\n  │20 Under 30│     24│     24│          17│     23│        1│     23│\r\n  │30 Under 40│     11│     34│           6│     34│        1│     33│\r\n  │40 Under 50│      2│     45│            │       │        1│     40│\r\n  │50 Under 60│      4│     54│           1│     58│        2│     55│\r\n  │60 Under 70│      5│     64│            │       │         │       │\r\n  ├───────────┼───────┼───────┼────────────┼───────┼─────────┼───────┤\r\n  │      Total│     52│     32│          28│     26│        5│     41│\r\n  └───────────┴───────┴───────┴────────────┴───────┴─────────┴───────┘\r\n\r\n  Out of 52 deaths in the year, 41 of the deceased attained an age of\r\n    25. The average age of the 33 who died of lung diseases was 28.\r\n\r\nIt is not doubted by medical witnesses that in this class of cases, as\r\nin the case of the tailors, one-third at least of the healthful duration\r\nof adult life will be found to have been destroyed by the ignorance of\r\nthe want of ventilation.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, this fatal ignorance as to the requisites of the places of\r\nwork is as frequently manifested in the overcrowded places of repose. I\r\ntake an illustration from the answers of _Mr. Isaac Gilchrist_, surgeon\r\nof Aberdeen, to the question as to the causes of fever:—\r\n\r\n  “In answering this query, the circumstance that calls for most remark\r\n  in reference to this district is the overcrowded state of dwelling\r\n  apartments. Six, eight, and even ten occupying one room is anything\r\n  but uncommon; and these, too, it frequently happens, are lone women,\r\n  all employed at the manufactories during the day and huddled together\r\n  during the night. Fever finding its way into any of these apartments,\r\n  seldom quits it until every member has been attacked. In some\r\n  instances of families of eight or ten members, not one individual has\r\n  escaped the disease. I believe also that deficient cleanliness (to a\r\n  certain extent the result of poverty) and bad ventilation co-operate\r\n  with the overcrowded state of the apartments in propagating fever.”\r\n\r\nSimilar information is frequent from the metropolis and other districts.\r\nIt is understood, and it may confidently be expected, that the\r\nCommissioners and Assistant Commissioners appointed to investigate the\r\nemployment of young persons employed in large numbers in other\r\nmanufactures than those now included in the provisions of the Factory\r\nAct will investigate more closely than has hitherto been done the\r\nsanitary condition of the labourers employed in the mines as well as in\r\nother branches of industry. I take the following evidence respecting the\r\ncondition of the lodging-shops, obtained by _Dr. Mitchell_, one of the\r\nAssistant Commissioners, in the course of his inquiries into the\r\ncondition of the labouring population engaged in working the mines in\r\nDurham and Northumberland. He gives the following description of their\r\nsleeping places:—\r\n\r\n  “Many of the miners, including young persons and boys, will go three\r\n  miles and upwards from their own homes in the morning to work in the\r\n  mines, or to wash the ore, and return again after their work at night.\r\n  Some miners, who are too far off to be able to go and come in this\r\n  way, find lodgings for the four nights in the week, and the washers\r\n  for five nights, at some houses not too far from the mines. The usual\r\n  price is 6_d._ a-week each, for which sum there is a bed between two\r\n  of them, leave to make their ‘crowdy’ on the fire in the morning, and\r\n  they have their potatoes boiled for them in the evening. They bring\r\n  their provisions in a wallet on the Monday mornings: the miners go\r\n  back on the Friday, and the washers of ore on the Saturday. But there\r\n  are many mines, and some of them very large, in remote situations in\r\n  the Fells, far away from all dwelling-houses, where lodgings might be\r\n  had, and the proprietors have erected for their miners and washers\r\n  buildings called ‘lodging-shops,’ which I now am about to describe:—\r\n\r\n  “The first one of them which I visited was about nine miles across the\r\n  Fell, south from Stanhope. It was a plain building, constructed of\r\n  sandstone, covered with a coarse slate; and all very substantial.\r\n  There was no opening or window at either end, nor at the back, nor on\r\n  the roof. On the front or south side was a door towards the west end,\r\n  and two windows, one a little above the other. On entering the door,\r\n  it was seen that the lower part was one room, lighted by one of the\r\n  windows, and had a great fire burning at the east end. By pacing the\r\n  floor the length was ascertained to be about 18 feet, and the breadth\r\n  about 15 feet. Along the one side, that next the window, was a deal\r\n  table, extending the whole length of the room, and alongside of it was\r\n  a form, and there were two other forms in the room. All along the\r\n  other side on the wall were little cupboards, 48 in number, in four\r\n  tiers above each other; six of the cupboards with the doors off, but\r\n  the most of the rest carefully locked with padlocks, and in which the\r\n  several miners had deposited their wallets with their provisions for\r\n  five days. Throughout the room, more particularly at the end furthest\r\n  from the fire, were hung from hooks and nails in the joists, miners’\r\n  trousers and jackets to be put on in case of the owners returning wet\r\n  from their work.\r\n\r\n  “In addition to the articles already named were the following:—\r\n\r\n  “One earthen pitcher to fetch water; one tea-kettle; one pan for\r\n  boiling potatoes; two pans for frying bacon; iron fender, a poker, and\r\n  shovel; a besom.\r\n\r\n  “There was a large box in the room secured by a padlock, said to\r\n  contain the clothes which the masters put on when they come to see the\r\n  mines.\r\n\r\n  “On ascending to the upper room by a ladder, it was seen to be a\r\n  sleeping-room. The dimensions of the floor were of course the same as\r\n  of the room below. There was no fire-place, which indeed was not\r\n  wanted, but neither was there any opening into a chimney to produce\r\n  circulation of air. Along one side of the room were three beds, each\r\n  six feet long by about four feet and a-half wide, the three beds\r\n  extending the length of the room; then there were three other beds on\r\n  the other side, and at the furthest end was a seventh bed extending\r\n  from the one line of beds to the other. Immediately over these seven\r\n  beds, and supported on posts, were seven other beds placed exactly in\r\n  the same way. Of course the person who slept in each of the six beds\r\n  of the upper tier next the wall could raise his head only a very\r\n  little way on account of the roof. Each of these 14 beds was intended\r\n  for two persons, when only few men were employed at the mines, but\r\n  they might be made to receive three men each, and, in case of need, a\r\n  boy might lie across at their feet. There was no opening of any sort\r\n  to let out the foul air, yet from 39 to 40 persons might have slept\r\n  there, the men perspiring from their work and inhaling the small dust\r\n  from their clothes floating in clouds. The beds were stuffed with\r\n  chaff. There were blankets but no sheets. The furniture of the\r\n  lodging-shops is supplied by the masters. The beds and blankets are\r\n  supplied by the miners themselves. They are taken home sometimes to be\r\n  washed. On Friday, when the miners leave, the beds are rolled up to\r\n  prevent damp. I visited the lodging-shop on Monday morning. The beds\r\n  had not been slept in for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights\r\n  preceding, yet was the smell most noxious. There was one excellent\r\n  thing connected with this lodging-shop: there was a small but\r\n  beautiful stream of water which was conducted across the Fell to this\r\n  spot, and came through an iron pipe near the door, so that the men had\r\n  an abundant supply of the pure element. I next went to see another\r\n  lodging-shop on a larger scale. On the ground-floor were five rooms.\r\n  The first is a blacksmith’s shop. Next to it is the cooking and\r\n  eating-room of the washers of ore; from 20 to 30 men and boys, if so\r\n  many, were employed. It was locked up, and I did not see it. The upper\r\n  room, extended over the blacksmith’s shop and the cooking room, is the\r\n  sleeping-room of the washers, men and boys. The next room on the\r\n  ground-floor is a cooking and eating-room of the miners, exactly like\r\n  the room of the lodging-shop already described. Adjoining to it is a\r\n  room in which they hang up their wet clothes. At the end is a stable\r\n  for the horses which are employed to draw the waggons with ore from\r\n  the pits. By a ladder close to the wall between the cooking-room and\r\n  drying-room is an ascent to a room exactly like that in the\r\n  lodging-house already described, with the same number of beds. One\r\n  little pipe of about two inches diameter was the only communication\r\n  with the exterior air. Through the partition wall is an opening into a\r\n  bed-room, extending over the drying-room and the stable. Across this\r\n  room extended two beds, leaving a space for passing. Above these two\r\n  was a tier of other two beds: then at a short interval was a second\r\n  set of beds, four in number; and further on, a third set similarly\r\n  arranged, four in number. Thus in the space above the cooking-room,\r\n  drying-room, and stable, were 26 beds, each intended for two or three\r\n  men, as it might be, and perhaps more; and the same beds for sets of\r\n  miners in their turns, as one set came from their work and another\r\n  went off.\r\n\r\n  “Though the beds had not been occupied for the three preceding nights,\r\n  the smell was to me utterly intolerable. What the place must be in the\r\n  summer nights is, happily for those who have never felt it, utterly\r\n  inconceivable. The medical men are best able to give a judgment on\r\n  these matters, but for my own part I cannot but believe that these\r\n  lodging-houses are more destructive than the air of the mines. I\r\n  should think it no hardship to have to remain 24 hours in a mine, but\r\n  I should be terrified at being ordered to be shut up a quarter of an\r\n  hour in the bed-room of a lodging-shop.\r\n\r\n  “Many miners speak of the horrors of lodging-shops of former days; but\r\n  the only difference I could learn was, that at many mines there were\r\n  not now so many men and boys at work, and consequently the\r\n  lodging-shops were not so crowded. Some mines are not now wrought\r\n  which formerly had large lodging-shops; for example, Mannergill, of\r\n  which a miner stated to me that he was one of 120 who lodged in a\r\n  suite of rooms there; and he declared that the nuisance was much\r\n  aggravated by the great number.\r\n\r\n  “In such a dense accumulation of bodies, one man who might be ill was\r\n  a disturbance to all the rest. The coughing of a few interrupted the\r\n  sleep of others. Men coming from the mine at 12 o’clock at night, and\r\n  frying their bacon at the fire below, sent up an odour which added to\r\n  the already too suffocating smell of the sleeping-room above. The\r\n  great number was an aggravation of what is intolerable at best.\r\n\r\n  “The miners showed me a tank through which running water passed, in\r\n  which they had placed their bottles of milk which they had brought\r\n  with them for their coffee.\r\n\r\n  “There was an excellent supply of running water of the best quality,\r\n  and it was the only beverage which the men had; for they stated that\r\n  there was no public-house or beer-shop nearer than seven miles, and if\r\n  there were one, they durst not go into it for fear of being\r\n  discharged.\r\n\r\n  “The men all said that their lodging-shop was a fair sample of all the\r\n  lodging-shops in the country, the only difference being the greater or\r\n  less number of men lodging in them, which would depend entirely on the\r\n  state of the mine. I have, however, since seen one refinement of which\r\n  these men did not seem to be aware, and that was a lodging-shop in\r\n  which were not only the beds in tiers all round the room, but there\r\n  also was a bed suspended or swung from the top of the room, which\r\n  economically filled up a space which otherwise would have been\r\n  vacant.”\r\n\r\nThe following is the account given by a miner himself of the\r\nlodging-places:—\r\n\r\n_William Eddy_, one of the miners, states;—\r\n\r\n  “I went to work in Greenside four years. Our lodging-rooms were such\r\n  as not to be fit for a swine to live in. In one house there was 16\r\n  bedsteads in the room up stairs, and 50 occupied these beds at the\r\n  same time. We could not always get all in together, but we got in when\r\n  we could. Often three at a time in the bed, and one at the foot. I\r\n  have several times had to get out of bed, and sit up all night to make\r\n  room for my little brothers, who were there as washers. There was not\r\n  a single flag or board on the lower floor, and there were pools of\r\n  water 12 inches deep. You might have taken a coal-rake and raked off\r\n  the dirt and potatoe peelings six inches deep. At one time we had not\r\n  a single coal. After I had been there two years, rules were laid down,\r\n  and two men were appointed by the master to clean the house up stairs\r\n  twice a-week. The lower apartment was to be cleaned twice a-day. Then\r\n  the shop floor was boarded, and two tables were placed in the shop.\r\n  After that two more shops were fitted up, but the increase of workmen\r\n  more than kept up with the increased accommodation. The breathing at\r\n  night when all were in bed was dreadful. The workmen received more\r\n  harm from the sleeping-places than from the work. There was one pane\r\n  of glass which we could open, but it was close to a bed-head.\r\n\r\n  “The mines at Greenside were well ventilated, and in that respect\r\n  there was nothing to complain of.\r\n\r\n  “In the winter time the icicles came through the roof, and within 12\r\n  inches of the people sleeping in bed. During a thaw, water dropped\r\n  plentifully into the beds. In the upper beds the person sleeping next\r\n  to the wall cannot raise his head or change his shirt.”\r\n\r\n_Joseph Eddy_, another workman, states:—\r\n\r\n  “I consider the lodging-shops more injurious to the health of the\r\n  miners than their work itself. So many sleeping in the same room, so\r\n  many breaths, so much stour arising from their working-clothes, so\r\n  much perspiration from the men themselves, it is impossible to be\r\n  comfortable. Two miners occupy one bed, sometimes three. The beds are\r\n  shaken once a-week on the Monday morning, when the miners come. Some\r\n  miners make their beds every night. The rooms are in general very\r\n  dirty, being never washed, and very seldom swept, not over once\r\n  a-month. There is no ventilation, so that the air is very close at\r\n  night.”\r\n\r\nIt is observed of this particular class of men that they are worn out\r\nsoon after forty; but a large share of this result may also be ascribed\r\nto their places of work. The following is a return of the ages of all\r\nthe miners who died during one year, including those who slept at their\r\nown homes, with those who had been accustomed to sleep at the\r\nlodging-shops.\r\n\r\n                    STATEMENT of Deaths from Disease\r\n                        and Accidents of Miners,\r\n                      Colliers, and Pitmen, in the\r\n                        Unions of Cumberland and\r\n                     Westmoreland, and parts of the\r\n                       Counties of Lancaster and\r\n                       Northumberland (Population\r\n                    Census of 1831, 338,273), during\r\n                     the Year ended 31st December,\r\n                     1839, as shown by the Mortuary\r\n                               Registers.\r\n\r\n                    ┌──────────────┬───────┬───────┐\r\n                    │  Periods of  │Number │Average│\r\n                    │     Age.     │  of   │ Age.  │\r\n                    │              │Deaths.│       │\r\n                    ├──────────────┼───────┼───────┤\r\n                    │     Under  20│     37│     15│\r\n                    │   20 Under 30│     39│     23│\r\n                    │   30 Under 40│     27│     33│\r\n                    │   40 Under 50│     27│     44│\r\n                    │   50 Under 60│     23│     55│\r\n                    │   60 Under 70│     32│     64│\r\n                    │   70 Under 80│     17│     75│\r\n                    │80 and upwards│     10│     86│\r\n                    ├──────────────┼───────┼───────┤\r\n                    │ Total deaths │    212│     42│\r\n                    └──────────────┴───────┴───────┘\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary view of the causes of death, from which it\r\nwill be seen that out of 212 deaths 69 fell from diseases of the\r\nrespiratory organs, and of these 52 died from consumption, whose average\r\nage of death was no more than 36½, and that no less than 58 were\r\ndestroyed by accidents.\r\n\r\n    STATEMENT of the Causes of Death amongst Miners in the Unions of\r\n Cumberland and Westmoreland and parts of the Counties of Lancaster and\r\n Northumberland, during the Year ended 31st December, 1839, as shown by\r\n                         the Mortuary Registers.\r\n\r\n ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┬──────────────┐\r\n │                   Cause of Death.                    │No. of Deaths.│\r\n ├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼──────────────┤\r\n │Disease of Respiratory Organs:—                       │              │\r\n │                              Consumption             │            52│\r\n │                              Other Diseases          │            17│\r\n │Epidemic and Contagious Disease                       │            20│\r\n │Accidents:—                                           │              │\r\n │                              In Mine                 │            37│\r\n │                              Not stated to be in Mine│            21│\r\n │Diseases of the Brain and Nerves                      │            12│\r\n │Diseases of the Digestive Organs                      │            10│\r\n │Disease of the Heart                                  │             2│\r\n │Other Causes of Disease                               │            22│\r\n │Natural Decay and Old Age                             │            19│\r\n ├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼──────────────┤\r\n │                     Total Deaths                     │           212│\r\n └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴──────────────┘\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent portion of this report I shall advert to the state of\r\nthe health of the miners in Cornwall, as compared by Dr. Barham with the\r\nstate of the agricultural labourers in the immediate vicinity of the\r\nmines.\r\n\r\nI would here request attention to a suggestion which appears to me to\r\narise from a consideration of the evils above displayed, (and that will\r\nreceive further corroboration in the course of this report,) that if\r\nthere were a regular system of periodical inspection of the places of\r\nwork or places of large assemblage, it would be attended with great\r\nadvantage to the lower orders of the community, in which the other\r\nclasses could not fail to participate.\r\n\r\nOne most important result of such investigations would be to disabuse\r\nthe popular mind of much prejudice against particular branches of\r\nindustry arising from the belief that causes of ill health really\r\n_accidental_ and removable, and sometimes unconnected, are _essentials_\r\nto the employment itself. By pointing out the real causes, warning will\r\nbe given for their avoidance, and indications extended for the\r\napplication of more certain remedies. Medical men who see only a few\r\npatients of the same occupation at distant intervals; who see them in\r\ntheir own dispensaries or in the hospitals, and who have no\r\nopportunities of observing such patients under the varied circumstances\r\nin which the disease may have been contracted, are left to mere guesses\r\nas to its cause. A working person of any of the classes whose condition\r\nI have described, presenting himself with the symptoms of a consumption,\r\nthe medical man has no means of detecting _the_ one of many causes by\r\nwhich it may have been occasioned, and the individual patient himself is\r\nmore likely to mislead than to inform him. Unless his attention were\r\naccidentally directed to it, or unless the medical investigator had\r\nhimself the means of observing the different personal condition of the\r\ndifferent sets of persons following the same occupation in town and in\r\ncountry, it is highly probable that the evidence that the disease is not\r\nessential to the occupation would escape him. Thus, between different\r\nsets of workmen who work at the same descriptions of work during the\r\nsame hours, and in the same town, but in well or in ill-ventilated\r\nfactories a marked difference in the personal condition and general\r\nhealth of the workpeople has been perceived. Great differences are\r\nperceptible in the general personal condition of persons working during\r\nthe same hours in cotton-mills in town, and in cotton-mills in rural\r\ndistricts, where they have not only a purer atmosphere, but commonly\r\nlarger and more commodious places of abode. The factory superintendents\r\ngenerally state that the workers in the country mills are\r\ndistinguishable at sight by their more healthy appearance, and by the\r\nincreased proportions amongst them who have florid complexions. Very\r\nlately the attention of the Austrian government was called to the labour\r\nof the persons working in the cotton-factories in the neighbourhood of\r\nVienna.[14] One half, perhaps, of the mills are of the ordinary\r\nconstruction of the cotton-mills in England of from thirty to forty\r\nyears’ date, and they work on the average as much as fifteen hours per\r\ndiem. But it appears that the houses in which the workers live belong to\r\nthe capitalists who own the mills, many of whom have displayed a desire\r\nto ensure, as far as the state of the private residences can ensure, the\r\ncomfort of those whom they employ, and they have accordingly built for\r\nthem a superior description of tenements. It is stated that the result\r\nof the inquiry conducted by the government physicians was, that the\r\naverage health enjoyed by the workers in those mills is greater than\r\nthat of any other class of workpeople in the neighbourhood where the\r\nmills are situate, and where the general condition of the population is\r\ndeemed good; the difference in the general health of the two classes\r\n(indicated by the proportions of death—of 1 in 27 of the general\r\npopulation, and 1 in 31 of the manufacturing population), was ascribed\r\nto the difference of the residences. My colleagues and myself of the\r\ncentral board of the Factory Commission of Inquiry were fully sensible\r\nthat the effect of one cause on the health of the working population\r\ncould not fairly be judged of unless its operation was observed under\r\nvarious circumstances, and unless amongst them the influence of the\r\ndomestic circumstances, as well as the nature of the work and the place\r\nof work, were duly examined. We could not but deem it important that the\r\nstate of the dwellings of the workpeople, who were the subject of\r\ninquiry, should also be investigated; and we gave instructions with that\r\nview to the district medical commissioners; but the limited time allowed\r\nby Parliament for the investigation, prevented its being made as we\r\ndesired, a circumstance that, for the sake of the workpeople, is much to\r\nbe regretted, as great injury is done to them by attention being\r\ndiverted, as it commonly has been, from the real means of\r\nprevention.[15]\r\n\r\nM. Parent Du Châtelet and M. d’Arcet having presented to the Board of\r\nHealth of Paris a report on an investigation with a view to discover the\r\nphysical or medical means by which particular sorts of work might be\r\nameliorated, observe—\r\n\r\n  “Perhaps it will be said that the task has been already performed, and\r\n  that several celebrated men, whose works are in the hands of all the\r\n  world, have preceded us in this career, without leaving to their\r\n  successors the hope to add anything to what they have published.\r\n\r\n  “We are assured beforehand that this objection will not be made by our\r\n  colleagues, who have penetrated into manufactures and have studied\r\n  their influence with a mind free from prejudice. It is because we have\r\n  studied the works which treat of the maladies of artisans, and have\r\n  seen a great number of these workmen in their shops; it is because we\r\n  have compared books with actual observation; it is, finally, because\r\n  we have not believed authors on their word, and have subjected them\r\n  all to a severe verification, that we have seen the insufficiency, nay\r\n  more, the inaccuracy of the greater part of their assertions.\r\n\r\n  “This method of proceeding has demonstrated to us that the works of\r\n  which we speak, far from being the fruit of long observation, have\r\n  been composed in the silence of the cabinet by men who have only had a\r\n  casual view of artisans and manufactures; and who, generalizing a few\r\n  facts presented to them by accident, have singularly exaggerated the\r\n  inconveniencies of some professions, and attributed to others\r\n  influences which they are far from exercising.”—_Mémoire sur les\r\n  Véritables Influences du Tabac sur la Santé des Ouvriers._ Par M.\r\n  Parent Du Châtelet.\r\n\r\nThey give, as an illustration, the exaggerated accounts of the\r\nmanufacture of tobacco, of which the supposed evils are proved to be\r\nentirely fictitious, or at best an erroneous application to the\r\nmanufacture,—of effects which, though incidentally met with in the\r\nworkmen, were equally common to others of their station. In an abstract\r\nof their paper, inserted in the Appendix, there is even an enumeration,\r\nby eminent physicians, of specific cases of death from the fancied\r\nagency of tobacco, but they only show the extent of error produced in\r\nthis and kindred instances by the previous conviction of the noxious\r\ninfluence of particular circumstances, and by referring all existing\r\nmaladies to these without further inquiry. If I might add my testimony\r\non this point, derived from my own observations on two of the\r\ncommissions of inquiry on which I have had the honour to serve, it would\r\nbe entirely in corroboration of the above statement. On comparing the\r\nactual condition of workmen with the medical descriptions of these\r\ndiseases, and the causes, we commonly found that the results of a\r\ncluster of causes are commonly ascribed to one; and in respect to\r\nseveral classes of workmen the real cause, the invariable antecedent,\r\nsuch as defective ventilation, is unnoticed. No persons were frequently\r\nmore surprised than the intelligent workmen, by the frequent exaggerated\r\naccounts of the operations of particular causes upon them, and the\r\nerroneous association of effects to causes with which they were known to\r\nhave no real connexion. For example, in the work of M. Patissier, one\r\nwhich is the chief work, and of European authority, on the diseases of\r\nartisans, he adverts to the diseases of tailors. His description was\r\nread to _Mr. Brownlow_, the tailor, examined upon the subject of the\r\novercrowding of places of work, and the observations of that witness on\r\nthe statement of M. Patissier are given in answer:—\r\n\r\n  _M. Patissier._ “The employment of tailor is one of the most\r\n  sedentary: seated constantly on a board, his legs crossed, his body\r\n  stooping forward, this class of labourers exercises not part of the\r\n  body but the arms, and that only the right one.”\r\n\r\n  _Witness._ “That is not so: there is a good deal of action with the\r\n  left arm in holding and sewing: in using the iron also there is a good\r\n  deal of action with the arms and knees, and with the rest of the body.\r\n  Journeymen tailors are remarked as being full breasted, as compared\r\n  with other workmen; they carry themselves higher, and the chest is\r\n  more fully developed; so that the labour has, as compared with much\r\n  other labour, the effect of opening the chest.”\r\n\r\n  _M. Patissier._ “Their position is particularly injurious to the\r\n  functions of the viscera of the abdomen and chest. It produces\r\n  difficulty of digestion, injures the gastric juices, brings on\r\n  constipation, hemorrhoides, chronic catarrhs of the bladder, and\r\n  obstructions of the bowels.”\r\n\r\n  _Witness._ “I have never heard complaints beginning with the bowels.\r\n  The stomach may be out of order; they eat very little solid food, and\r\n  of course the action of the bowels will not be very good; but as to\r\n  the effect of the tailors’ work on the chest, we do not consider it at\r\n  all injurious.”\r\n\r\n  _M. Patissier._ “I attended a tailor who every time that he applied\r\n  himself diligently to his work, was attacked with nausea, colic,\r\n  jaundice, and symptoms that denoted irritation of the liver. I have\r\n  known, says Stoll, a great number of tailors who have suffered more\r\n  particularly from diseases of the lungs.”\r\n\r\n  _Witness._ “The only complaints I have ever heard are those arising\r\n  from the foul air, perhaps the dust arising from cloth is injurious. I\r\n  have already said that men coming from the country to a town shop will\r\n  faint, and be obliged to leave it in the afternoon.”\r\n\r\n  _M. Patissier._ “As they are almost constantly in a sitting posture,\r\n  the body bent, with the head stooping forward, the blood is unequally\r\n  distributed, and too large a quantity accumulates in the lungs, either\r\n  because the bowels of the abdomen, compressed by the position of the\r\n  body, admit of less blood, and which is therefore forced back into the\r\n  vessels situated above, or because the short respirations of those who\r\n  are sedentary, prevents the blood which enters the lungs from passing\r\n  out with sufficient rapidity, by which local plethora in the heart and\r\n  lungs is produced. In short, tailors are very liable to pulmonary\r\n  phthisis, hydro-thorax, and hæmoptysis, which often accompanies them\r\n  to a very advanced age. M. Corvisart has observed that diseases of the\r\n  heart and of the larger vessels are not less frequent amongst this\r\n  class of artisans. As the posture of the tailor causes the blood to\r\n  flow into the upper part of the body, the circulation in the lower\r\n  members is consequently much less active, which explains the\r\n  emaciation and feebleness of the legs and thighs of this class of\r\n  artisans, and the peculiar walk which distinguishes them.”\r\n\r\n  _Witness._ “As to the circulation of the blood, I should say that it\r\n  was more free than amongst persons sitting at a desk; as soon as the\r\n  journeyman tailor begins to feel warm and swell, he loosens everything\r\n  that he has on; his coat is off, and his shirt neck is open; if he\r\n  wears a handkerchief it is very loose; a tailor wears no garters,\r\n  nothing that can stop the circulation of the blood: the only\r\n  confinement that arises is from the position, which is certainly\r\n  sedentary, but he frequently changes it, and puts one leg over the\r\n  other when they are tired; they also stretch their legs out. Their\r\n  breathing even in the close shops is not noticed as short.”\r\n\r\n  _M. Patissier._ “Ramazzini says they are very subject to numbness of\r\n  the thighs, neuralgic sciatica, and lameness.”\r\n\r\n  _Witness._ “The tailors are frequently subject to rheumatism, but that\r\n  is from going from a hot to the cold open air in the way described.\r\n  Men who are generally emaciated will have their legs emaciated too:\r\n  the whole frame goes together, but I have never heard young men or\r\n  tailors in the middle of life being remarked as deficient in that part\r\n  of bodily capability. Those whom I have known to be emaciated have\r\n  been spirit drinkers; the emaciation has been more from\r\n  spirit-drinking than from the heat of the shop, though one brings on\r\n  the other. Some years ago there used to be much racing at about five\r\n  o’clock in the morning in the parks, sometimes amongst the tailors\r\n  themselves, and sometimes with other runners who had celebrity. The\r\n  tailors were generally good competitors and more active than other\r\n  workmen in London. There was one of the country tailors at Faversham\r\n  who some years ago was considered the first runner in England for a\r\n  hundred yards. The tailors have certainly a peculiar walk, but all\r\n  whom I have known to be lame were lame originally. When a lad has\r\n  anything the matter with him, which occasions him not to be strong\r\n  enough for anything working on his feet, it is a common thing to say,\r\n  ‘Then we must make him a tailor.’ It is a very frequent thing to send\r\n  weakly children to be tailors, though it is a bad choice, for the lad\r\n  has little chance of recovering himself in the town shops, and a more\r\n  open trade would be better for him. Many tailors go for sailors and\r\n  soldiers, and they are always thought to be good men. I should think\r\n  there are many tailors in the guards.”\r\n\r\n  _M. Patissier._ “There is sometimes to be observed on the surface of\r\n  their skin a psoriform eruption, which by some writers is ascribed to\r\n  the irritation of the woollen cloth which these artisans are\r\n  continually handling. Guldner, however, considers that this eruption\r\n  is produced by their mode of living.”\r\n\r\n  _Witness._ “I never saw or heard of any peculiar eruption on the skin\r\n  of the tailors, though they perhaps do not attend sufficiently to\r\n  personal cleanliness. The dye of cloth is sometimes bad, but I never\r\n  observed any effects from it.”\r\n\r\n  _M. Patissier._ “Tailors are apt to prick themselves with their\r\n  needles, and these wounds often bring on festerings.”\r\n\r\n  _Witness._ “That is certainly the case; the needle may carry with it\r\n  some of the dye, and the festering may also be occasioned by the bad\r\n  state of the body.”\r\n\r\n  _M. Patissier._ “They almost all have decayed teeth, which are\r\n  destroyed by the habit of biting their thread with them. It is very\r\n  rare to see a tailor of advanced age with any front teeth.”\r\n\r\n  _Witness._ “That is certainly so: they have many of them bad teeth,\r\n  but I have not noticed any deficiency of the front teeth.”\r\n\r\n  _M. Patissier._ “Their sight is soon enfeebled by the fine work which\r\n  they have to execute, often at night by the light of candles. When\r\n  they work in the evening at open windows, they are liable to be\r\n  affected by earache, tooth-ache, cold in the head, and sore eyes.”\r\n\r\n  _Witness._ “That is very correct with respect to the tailors in town,\r\n  but it is not noticed so much with tailors in the country.”\r\n\r\n  _M. Patissier._ “The sedentary life which they lead produces heavy,\r\n  soft flesh, that has no firmness; they generally are thin in body,\r\n  legs are spare and feeble, and their complexion rather jaundiced.”\r\n\r\n  _Witness._ “Almost all this will be found to be the effect of habits\r\n  that have nothing to do with the trade.”\r\n\r\n  _M. Patissier._ “Tailors ought to walk in the open air every evening\r\n  when their work will admit of it, rub their limbs well with flannel,\r\n  abstain from all food difficult of digestion, avoid all excesses, and\r\n  generally every kind of debauchery.”\r\n\r\n  _Witness._ “The men when they leave their shop-boards do not begin\r\n  rubbing their legs, and do not appear to feel the least want of it.\r\n  The appetites of men working in shops being bad, they do commonly take\r\n  food that is easy of digestion, as they cannot do with the coarser\r\n  food. When a tailor comes from the country he will eat a twopenny loaf\r\n  and take a pint of coffee for breakfast; but after three or four\r\n  months working in the close shop getting exhausted, then taking beer\r\n  and then spirits, his appetite fails him, and I have seen him eat only\r\n  a small slice of bread and butter, and take half a pint of coffee for\r\n  breakfast, and his appetite generally fails him. The young men on\r\n  going back to their work in the country, generally recover their\r\n  appetites unless disease has taken such root that they cannot\r\n  recover.”\r\n\r\nThe evidence of Mr. Brownlow was read to Dr. Weber, who has had under\r\nhis care between 200 and 300 cases of journeymen tailors who were\r\ntreated by him, as physician to the St. George’s Dispensary, which is\r\nmuch resorted to by those of that class of workmen who reside at the\r\nwest end of the metropolis. Dr. Weber confirms the general tenor of the\r\nevidence as to the medical facts, and especially the general conclusion\r\nthat the greatest proportion of the diseases to which they are subject\r\narise from circumstances separable from their occupation. The evidence\r\nas to the personal condition and habits of the workmen is generally\r\ncorroborated by several master tailors, who state that the journeyman\r\ntailor in the rural district who works singly, or in a well-ventilated\r\napartment, is in person commonly the opposite of the one described by M.\r\nPatissier; he is described as being a hard worker, but at times a man\r\nwho is in most village foot races, and not unfrequently the foremost\r\nrunner, and in games of foot-ball not the last. The journeymen tailors\r\nare found amongst the best men in the life guards. In consequence of a\r\nstrike of tailors, one dragoon regiment had a troop chiefly enlisted\r\nfrom them, and military men state that they greatly distinguished\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIf we thus find the crowding of unventilated places of work injurious—in\r\nwhich persons rarely pass more than 12 out of the 24 hours, being free\r\nduring the remaining time to breathe what air they please—how much worse\r\nshould we expect the consequences to be of the same fault in workhouses,\r\nhospitals, schools, and prisons, in which individuals often pass both\r\nday and night in the same apartments, or if in different apartments,\r\nstill in the same crowd. Accordingly, since the attention of medical men\r\nhas been sufficiently directed to the subject, the explanation has\r\nbecome complete of many deplorable cases of general ill health and\r\nmortality in such places, attributed at first to deficiency or bad\r\nquality of food, or to any cause but the true one,—want of ventilation.\r\nA striking illustration of this was afforded in the case of a large\r\nschool for children during the years 1836 and 1837, as recorded in the\r\nsecond volume of the Poor Law Reports. Such general failure of health\r\nand such mortality had occurred among the children as to attract public\r\nnotice and the animadversions of many medical men and others who visited\r\nthe schools; but by most the evil was attributed chiefly to faulty\r\nnourishment; and it was only after the more complete examination, made\r\nby direction of the board, and of which the report is published, as\r\nabove stated, that the diet was found to be unusually good, but the\r\nventilation very imperfect. Suitable changes were then made; and now, in\r\nthe same space where 700 children were by illness awakening extensive\r\nsympathy, 1100 now enjoy excellent health. The defective state of\r\ninformation on the subject of ventilation is frequently shown in reports\r\nwhich assume that apartments containing given cubic feet of space are\r\nall that is requisite for life and health, whereas if a spacious\r\ndrawing-room be completely closed against the admission of air, an\r\ninhabitant confined to it would in time be stifled, whilst, by active\r\nventilation or change of air, men working in connexion with\r\ndiving-machines live in the space of a helmet, which merely confines the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of instances of the defective ventilation of schools,\r\nthe pallid countenance and delicate health of the schoolboy, which is\r\ncommonly laid to the account of over-application to his book, is due\r\nsimply to the defective construction of the school-room. In the dame\r\nschools, and the schools for the labouring classes, the defective\r\nventilation is the most frequent and mischievous.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Riddall Wood_, an agent of the Manchester Statistical Society, thus\r\ndescribes some of the crowded schools found in the course of\r\nexaminations, from house to house, of the condition of the town\r\npopulation in Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Hull, and York:—\r\n\r\n  “I may mention that in one school where the average attendance was, I\r\n  think, 36, not above eight children were present. Upon my inquiring of\r\n  the mistress as to the reason, she stated that the remainder of her\r\n  scholars had been taken with the measles. I perceived a bed in the\r\n  school-room, upon which lay a child much disfigured by that complaint.\r\n  Another child of the mistress had died of the measles. I had reason to\r\n  believe that the contagion had been communicated originally from that\r\n  child, because the cases of the scholars all occurred subsequently. In\r\n  a school in Liverpool, having above 40 scholars in average attendance,\r\n  I found the number diminished to somewhere about 10. On inquiring into\r\n  this case, I ascertained that it arose from the prevalence of scarlet\r\n  fever, and the master made this remark: ‘It is a very strange thing\r\n  how this fever should have attacked almost all the children coming to\r\n  my school, whilst none of my neighbours have got it.’ I attributed\r\n  that to the very crowded state of the school. The room was very low.\r\n  When the whole of his scholars were in attendance, it must have been\r\n  excessively crowded. There was no thorough ventilation.\r\n\r\n  “I found that in many of the schools there were from 20 to (in some\r\n  cases) nearly 100 scholars crammed into a dirty house or cellar,\r\n  without air or ventilation, the effluvia from whose breath and clothes\r\n  was exceedingly offensive, and must, I am sure, be very injurious to\r\n  the children’s health. In most of these places, too, I have found that\r\n  the ordinary household occupations have been carried on by the old\r\n  women.”\r\n\r\nAnother inquirer states, that in the neighbourhood of Bolton he saw 70\r\nscholars cooped up in a badly ventilated room not 12 feet square.\r\n\r\n\r\n         _Bad ventilation and overcrowding of private houses._\r\n\r\nThe reports from the great majority of the new unions present evidence\r\nof the severe overcrowding of the cottages in the rural districts, and\r\nthe tenements occupied by the working classes in towns.\r\n\r\nFrom the returns as laid before the public from the commissioners\r\nappointed to take the last census, it would appear, however, that the\r\nnumber of houses has more than kept pace with the increase of the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nFrom these returns it would appear that the increase of houses even in\r\nScotland has more than kept pace with the increase of population. But\r\nthis result was so much at variance with the reports and communications\r\nfrom all parts of the country relating to the dwellings of the labouring\r\nclasses, that if any increase of the proportions of houses to the\r\npopulation had taken place, it must have been in the houses of the\r\nmiddle and higher classes of the community. I learn, however, the fact\r\nto be, that whilst in obtaining the previous census, merely the heading\r\nwas given without any instruction for the officer to fill up the “number\r\nof houses” on the occasion of taking the last census, the commissioners\r\nordered each separate occupation under the same roof to be returned as a\r\nhouse. In the Scotch towns, and in many of the English towns where it is\r\nthe custom to let off as separate tenements the flats or floors under\r\nthe same roof, there will, unless it be explained, appear to have been,\r\nas compared with the numbers in the last census, when the buildings and\r\nnot its subdivisions were returned, an increase of accommodation, when,\r\nin reality, there may only have been an increased subdivision of\r\ntenements in consequence of an increased pressure of population. The\r\nevidence received from every part of the country, from rural districts\r\nas well as from towns, attest that the dwellings of large numbers of the\r\nlabouring population are overcrowded, and from many districts that the\r\novercrowding has increased.\r\n\r\nFor example, the report of _Dr. Laurie_ from Greenock states, that such\r\nis the crowding of the population in the town that—\r\n\r\n  “Toward the east or old part of the town the amount of population\r\n  crowded into a small space can hardly be credited, the rapid increase\r\n  of the population has so far overstepped the means of accommodation\r\n  that not the meanest outhouse remains without its tenants.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. Walker_, one of the senior surgeons to the Greenock Infirmary, also\r\nstates that,—\r\n\r\n  “The rooms are in most instances small, and frequently far too much\r\n  crowded. It is not unusual to see ten or twelve human beings occupying\r\n  a room not as many feet square. The lower classes in these districts\r\n  are grossly filthy in their persons and dwellings; and even many of\r\n  our operatives who receive good wages are extremely inattentive to\r\n  cleanliness, both in person and dwelling.”\r\n\r\nIn a paper on the causes of destitution in Scotland, by _Professor\r\nAlison_, read before the Statistical Society of London, it is stated\r\nthat—\r\n\r\n  “From a report on the late census, made to the Lord Provost of Glasgow\r\n  by Mr. Strang, Chamberlain, (19th July, 1841,) it appears that in the\r\n  most densely peopled part of the town, (Blackfriars’ parish,) the\r\n  population since 1831 has increased 40 per cent., while the number of\r\n  inhabited houses has not increased at all; and again, in the Gorbals,\r\n  ‘there is an increase in the population of 20 per cent, since 1831,’\r\n  though no new buildings have been erected, and where the great\r\n  majority of the houses are of the smallest class.”—(Watt’s Report, p.\r\n  11.)\r\n\r\n_Dr. Scott Alison_ in his report on Tranent, states,—\r\n\r\n  “In many houses in and around Tranent, fowls roost on the rafters and\r\n  on the tops of the bedsteads. The effluvia in these houses are\r\n  offensive, and must prove very unwholesome. It is scarcely necessary\r\n  to say that these houses are very filthy. They swarm likewise with\r\n  fleas. Dogs live in the interior of the lowest houses, and must, of\r\n  course, be opposed to cleanliness. I have seen horses in two houses in\r\n  Tranent inhabiting the same apartment with numerous families. One was\r\n  in Dow’s Bounds. Several of the family were ill of typhus fever, and I\r\n  remember the horse stood at the back of the bed. In this case the\r\n  stench was dreadful. In addition to the horse there were fowls, and I\r\n  think the family was not under ten souls. The father died of typhus on\r\n  this occasion. The families of most of the labouring people are\r\n  crowded, in consequence of the smallness of the apartment. Where there\r\n  are many children, it is common for 10 or 12 people to inhabit one\r\n  apartment, and for four children to lie in one bed, both in health and\r\n  sickness. When a collier has few or no children, he sometimes takes\r\n  single men and women as lodgers.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. Keith_ says the—\r\n\r\n  “Crowding is fearful. I have seen six or eight sleeping in one\r\n  apartment, with every crevice stopped, and have more than once been\r\n  nearly suffocated by entering the apartment even after several of them\r\n  were up and out.”\r\n\r\nAs the information sought from the medical officers and witnesses in the\r\ncourse of this inquiry was chiefly as to the sanitary condition of the\r\npopulation, they might, naturally be expected only to notice the\r\novercrowding as one of the causes of ill health; and they do frequently\r\nnotice the fact in that sense; but the overcrowding is also frequently\r\nnoticed as a cause of extreme demoralization and recklessness, and\r\nrecklessness, again, as a cause of disease. The following may be given\r\nas examples of the statements in respect to overcrowding in the rural\r\ndistricts in England.\r\n\r\n_Mr. T. P. J. Grantham_, medical officer of the Sleaford union, in\r\nreference to the typhus fever in the family of an agricultural labourer,\r\ngives the following instance of the overcrowding which is frequent in\r\nthe rural districts:—\r\n\r\n  “The domestic economy in this house was deplorable; eight persons\r\n  slept in one small ill-ventilated apartment, with scarcely any\r\n  bed-clothing; the smell arising from want of cleanliness, and the\r\n  dirty clothes of the children being allowed to accumulate, was most\r\n  intolerable. Considering the situation of the house, its filthy state,\r\n  and the vitiated air which must have been respired over and over\r\n  again, by eight individuals sleeping in one confined apartment, it is\r\n  not surprising that this family should have been afflicted with fever,\r\n  and that of a very malignant type; the mother and one child fell\r\n  victims to it in a very short time.”\r\n\r\n\r\n     _The want of separate apartments, and overcrowding of private\r\n                              dwellings._\r\n\r\nThe following extract from a communication from the clerk to the\r\nAmpthill union, pourtrays the effects of this overcrowding on the morals\r\nof the population.\r\n\r\n  “A large proportion of the cottages in the Union are very miserable\r\n  places, small and inconvenient, in which it is impossible to keep up\r\n  even the common decencies of life. I will refer to one instance with\r\n  which I am well acquainted:—A man, his wife, and family, consisting in\r\n  all of 11 individuals, resided in a cottage containing only two rooms.\r\n  The man, his wife, and four children, sometimes five, slept in one of\r\n  the rooms, and in one bed, some at the foot, others at the top, one a\r\n  girl above 14, another a boy above 12, the rest younger. The other\r\n  part of the family slept in one bed in the keeping-room, that is, the\r\n  room in which their cooking, washing, and eating were performed. How\r\n  could it be otherwise with this family than that they should be sunk\r\n  into a most deplorable state of degradation and depravity? This, it\r\n  may be said, is an extreme case, but there are many similar, and a\r\n  very great number that make near approaches to it. To pursue a further\r\n  account of this family: the man is reported to be a good labourer, the\r\n  cottage he held was recently pulled down, and being unable to procure\r\n  another, he was forced to come into the workhouse. After being in a\r\n  short time, they left to try again to get a home, but again failed.\r\n  The man then absconded, and the family returned to the workhouse. The\r\n  eldest, a female, has had a bastard child, and another, younger, also\r\n  a female but grown up, has recently been sentenced to transportation\r\n  for stealing in a dwelling house. The family, when they came in, were\r\n  observed to be of grossly filthy habits and of disgusting behaviour; I\r\n  am glad to say, however, that their general conduct and appearance is\r\n  very much improved since they have become inmates of the workhouse. I\r\n  without scruple express my opinion that their degraded moral state is\r\n  mainly attributable to the wretched way in which they have lived and\r\n  herded together as previously described. I have been thus particular\r\n  in my account of this family, knowing it to be a type of many others,\r\n  and intending it to apply to that part of your letter inquiring\r\n  respecting the comparative character of the female inmates and\r\n  children of the two descriptions of cottages in question.”\r\n\r\nThe _relieving officer_ of the Leighton Buzzard union states that, in\r\nLeighton,—\r\n\r\n  “There are a number of cottages without sleeping-rooms separate from\r\n  the day-rooms, and frequently three or four families are found\r\n  occupying the same bed-room, and young men and women promiscuously\r\n  sleeping in the same apartment.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Blick_, the medical officer of the Bicester union, states that:—\r\n\r\n  “The residences of the poor in that part of the district are most\r\n  wretched, the majority consisting of only one room below and one\r\n  above, in which a family of eight or ten (upon an average, I should\r\n  say five), live and sleep. In one of these rooms I have witnessed a\r\n  father, mother, three grown-up sons, a daughter, and a child, lying at\r\n  the same time with typhus fever: but few of the adjacent residents\r\n  escaped the infection.”\r\n\r\nMr. _L. O. Fox_, the medical officer of the Romsey union, states:—\r\n\r\n  “There is not only a great want of cottages, but also of room in those\r\n  which now stand. In the parish of Mottisfont I have known 14\r\n  individuals of one family together in a small room, the mother being\r\n  in labour at the time, and in the adjoining room seven other persons\r\n  sleeping, making 21 persons, in a space which should be occupied by\r\n  six persons only at most. Here are the young woman and young man of 18\r\n  or 20 years of age lying alongside of the father and mother, and the\r\n  latter actually in labour. It will be asked what is the condition of\r\n  the inmates?—Just such as might be expected.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. Gilly_, the canon of Durham, whose appeal on behalf of the border\r\npeasantry, and description of the sheds into which they are placed have\r\nbeen cited, observes, upon the crowding of these small places, 24 feet\r\nby 16, with 8, 10, or even 12 persons:—\r\n\r\n  “How they lie down to rest, how they sleep, how they can preserve\r\n  common decency, how unutterable horrors are avoided, is beyond all\r\n  conception. The case is aggravated when there is a young woman to be\r\n  lodged in this confined space who is not a member of the family, but\r\n  is hired to do the field-work, for which every hind is bound to\r\n  provide a female. It shocks every feeling of propriety to think that\r\n  in a room, and within such a space as I have been describing,\r\n  civilized beings should be herding together without a decent\r\n  separation of age and sex. So long as the agricultural system in this\r\n  district requires the hind to find room for a fellow-servant of the\r\n  other sex in his cabin, the least that morality and decency can demand\r\n  is that he should have a second apartment where the unmarried female\r\n  and those of a tender age should sleep apart from him and his wife.\r\n  Last Whitsuntide, when the annual lettings were taking place, a hind,\r\n  who had lived one year in the hovel he was about to quit, called to\r\n  say farewell, and to thank me for some trifling kindness I had been\r\n  able to show him. He was a fine tall man of about 45, a fair specimen\r\n  of the frank, sensible, well-spoken, well-informed Northumbrian\r\n  peasantry—of that peasantry of which a militia regiment was composed,\r\n  which so amazed the Londoners (when it was garrisoned in the capital\r\n  many years ago) by the size, the noble deportment, the soldier-like\r\n  bearing, and the good conduct of the men. I thought this a good\r\n  opportunity of asking some questions. Where was he going? and how\r\n  would he dispose of his large family (eleven in number)? He told me\r\n  they were to inhabit one of these hind’s cottages, whose narrow\r\n  dimensions were less than 24 feet by 15, and that the eleven would\r\n  have only three beds to sleep on; that he himself, his wife, a\r\n  daughter of 6, and a boy of 4 years old, would sleep in one bed; that\r\n  a daughter of 18, a son of 12, a son of 10, and a daughter of 8 would\r\n  have a second bed; and a third would receive his three sons of the age\r\n  of 20, 16, and 14. ‘Pray,’ said I, ‘do you not think that this is a\r\n  very improper way of disposing of your family?’ ‘Yes, certainly,’ was\r\n  the answer; ‘it is very improper in a Christian point of view; but\r\n  what can we do until they build us better houses.’”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Riddall Wood_ was examined as to the effects of overcrowded\r\ntenements on the moral habits observed in the course of his visits from\r\nhouse to house in the various towns he was engaged to examine:—\r\n\r\n  “In what towns did you find instances of the greatest crowding of the\r\n  habitations?—In Manchester, Liverpool, Ashton-under-Lyne, and\r\n  Pendleton. In a cellar in Pendleton, I recollect there were three beds\r\n  in the two apartments of which the habitation consisted, but having no\r\n  door between them, in one of which a man and his wife slept; in\r\n  another, a man, his wife and child; and in a third two unmarried\r\n  females. In Hull I have met with cases somewhat similar. A mother\r\n  about 50 years of age, and her son I should think 25, at all events\r\n  above 21, sleeping in the same bed, and a lodger in the same room. I\r\n  have two or three instances in Hull in which a mother was sleeping\r\n  with her grown up son, and in most cases there were other persons\r\n  sleeping in the same room, in another bed. In a cellar in Liverpool, I\r\n  found a mother and her grown-up daughters sleeping on a bed of chaff\r\n  on the ground in one corner of the cellar, and in the other corner\r\n  three sailors had their bed. I have met with upwards of 40 persons\r\n  sleeping in the same room, married and single, including, of course,\r\n  children and several young adult persons of either sex. In Manchester\r\n  I could enumerate a variety of instances in which I found such\r\n  promiscuous mixture of the sexes in sleeping-rooms. I may mention one;\r\n  a man, his wife and child sleeping in one bed; in another bed, two\r\n  grown up females; and in the same room two young men, unmarried. I\r\n  have met with instances of a man, his wife, and his wife’s sister,\r\n  sleeping in the same bed together. I have known at least half-a-dozen\r\n  cases in Manchester in which that has been regularly practised, the\r\n  unmarried sister being an adult.\r\n\r\n  “In the course of your own inquiry, how many instances, if you were to\r\n  look over your Notes, of persons of different sexes sleeping\r\n  promiscuously, do you think you met with?—I think I am speaking within\r\n  bounds when I say I have amongst my memoranda above 100 cases,\r\n  including, of course, cases of persons of different sexes sleeping in\r\n  the same room.\r\n\r\n  “Was it so common as to be in nowise deemed extraordinary or culpable\r\n  amongst that class of persons?—It seemed not to be thought of. As a\r\n  proof of this I may mention one circumstance which just occurs to\r\n  me:—Early in my visitation of Pendleton, I called at the dwelling of a\r\n  person whose sons worked with himself in a colliery. It was in the\r\n  afternoon, when a young man, one of the sons, came down stairs in his\r\n  shirt and stood before the fire where a very decently-dressed young\r\n  female was sitting. The son asked his mother for a clean shirt, and on\r\n  its being given to him, very deliberately threw off the shirt he had\r\n  on, and after warming the clean one, put it on. In another dwelling in\r\n  Pendleton, a young girl 18 years of age, sat by the fire in her\r\n  chemise during the whole time of my visit. Both these were houses of\r\n  working people (colliers), and not by any means of ill-fame.\r\n\r\n  “During your inquiries were you able to observe any further\r\n  demoralization attendant upon these circumstances?—I have frequently\r\n  met with instances in which the parties themselves have traced their\r\n  own depravity to these circumstances. As, for example, while I was\r\n  following out my inquiries in Hull, I found in one room a prostitute,\r\n  with whom I remonstrated on her course of life, and asked her whether\r\n  she would not be in a better condition if she were an honest servant\r\n  instead of living in vice and wretchedness. She admitted she should,\r\n  and on asking the cause of her being brought to her present condition,\r\n  she stated that she had lodged with a married sister, and slept in the\r\n  same bed with her and her husband; that hence improper intercourse\r\n  took place, and from that she gradually became more and more depraved;\r\n  and at length was thrown upon the town, because, having lost her\r\n  character, the town was her only resource. Another female of this\r\n  description admitted that her first false step was in consequence of\r\n  her sleeping in the same room with a married couple. In the instance I\r\n  have mentioned of the two single women sleeping in the same room with\r\n  the married people, I have good authority for believing that they were\r\n  common to the men. In the case which I have mentioned of the two\r\n  daughters and the woman where I found the sailors, I learned, from the\r\n  mother’s admission, that they were common to the lodgers. In all of\r\n  these cases the sense of decency was obliterated.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Baker_, in his report on the condition of the labouring classes in\r\nLeeds corroborates this statement:—\r\n\r\n  “In the houses of the working classes, brothers and sisters, and\r\n  lodgers of both sexes, are found occupying the same sleeping-room with\r\n  the parents, and consequences occur which humanity shudders to\r\n  contemplate. It is but three or four years ago since a father and\r\n  daughter stood at the bar of the Leeds Sessions as criminals, the one\r\n  in concealing, and the other in being an accessary to concealing, the\r\n  birth of an illegitimate child, born on the body of the daughter by\r\n  the father; and now, in November, 1841, one of the Registrars of Leeds\r\n  has recorded the birth of an illegitimate child born on the body of a\r\n  young girl, only 16 years of age, who lived with her mother, who\r\n  cohabited with her lodger, the father of this child, of which the girl\r\n  had been pregnant five months, when the mother died.”\r\n\r\nThe overcrowding of the tenements of the labouring classes is productive\r\nof demoralization in a mode pointed out by _Mr. Barnett_, the clerk to\r\nthe Nottingham Union, who states—\r\n\r\n  “That the houses are generally too small to afford a comfortable\r\n  reception to the family, and the consequence is that the junior\r\n  members are generally in the streets. Girls and youths destitute of\r\n  adequate house-room, and freed from parental control, are accustomed\r\n  to gross immoralities.”\r\n\r\nHereafter, when considering the pecuniary means of defraying the expense\r\nof sanitary measures, it will be shown how much less of such\r\nconsequences in most districts than may be supposed is ascribable to\r\nabsolute poverty or real inability to pay for better accommodation. To\r\nobviate even immediate impressions of this description, I might adduce\r\nmuch evidence of the character of the following testimony of _Mr. J.\r\nThomson_, of Clitheroe:—\r\n\r\n  “What is the number of persons whom you have in your employment?—Men,\r\n  women, and children, between 900 and 1000.\r\n\r\n  “Are you the owner of any of the tenements where they reside?—Very\r\n  few; not more than 12 or 15.\r\n\r\n  “What description of tenements are they?—Houses with two rooms above,\r\n  two rooms below, and a yard; and letting at a rent of from 7_l._ to\r\n  8_l._ per annum. These are occupied by foremen in various departments,\r\n  and the better description of artisans.\r\n\r\n  “What wages do this description of persons earn?—Various, from 30_s._\r\n  to 3_l._ weekly; averaging, perhaps, 2_l._ weekly; out of which they\r\n  pay 3_s._ per week for rent.\r\n\r\n  “What is your experience in respect to the habits of the workpeople in\r\n  these tenements?—The remark which I have to make is on the very low\r\n  state of feeling prevalent amongst even a high class of workmen as to\r\n  decency or propriety. The tenements sufficed for them when they were\r\n  young, but when the female children become young women, and the boys\r\n  advance to puberty, and decency requires them to have separate rooms,\r\n  the usual practice of the parents is to take the young women into\r\n  their own sleeping-rooms. I have one highly respectable foreman who\r\n  has one daughter aged 20, and another aged 22, sleeping on each side\r\n  of the bed in which himself and his wife sleep. The next bed-room is\r\n  filled with the younger children of both sexes, boys and girls, up to\r\n  16 years of age. The earnings of this family must have been 50_s._ per\r\n  week. The rent they paid was 3_s._ weekly, which was little more than\r\n  the interest on the money invested. I have remonstrated on the\r\n  indecency of such habits, and on their bad effects, but the expense of\r\n  the extra shilling a-week for a house with another bed-room was\r\n  considered a sufficient answer to my remonstrance. In my own tenements\r\n  I have built the additional room, and notwithstanding the\r\n  remonstrances, I have required the additional rent. When they have\r\n  remonstrated, I have told them of the fact, that the cost of the\r\n  additional room would only be a beneficial deduction from the money\r\n  spent in liquor.”\r\n\r\nIt would require much time and various opportunities of observation to\r\nattempt to make an exact analysis of the combined causes, and an\r\nestimate of the effect of each separate cause which operate to produce\r\nthe masses of moral and physical wretchedness met with in the\r\ninvestigation of the condition of the lowest population. But it became\r\nevident, in the progress of the inquiry, that several separate\r\ncircumstances had each its separate moral as well as physical influence.\r\nThus tenements of inferior construction had manifestly an injurious\r\noperation on the moral as well as on the sanitary condition,\r\nindependently of any overcrowding. For example, it appears to be matter\r\nof common observation, in the instance of migrant families of workpeople\r\nwho are obliged to occupy inferior tenements, that their habits soon\r\nbecome “of a piece” with the dwelling. A gentleman who has observed\r\nclosely the condition of the workpeople in the south of Cheshire and the\r\nnorth of Lancashire, men of similar race and education, working at the\r\nsame description of work, namely, as cotton-spinners, mill hands, and\r\nearning nearly the same amount of wages, states that the workmen of the\r\nnorth of Lancashire are obviously inferior to those in the south of\r\nCheshire, in health and habits of personal cleanliness and general\r\ncondition. The difference is traced mainly to the circumstance, that the\r\nlabourers in the north of Lancashire inhabit stone houses of a\r\ndescription that absorb moisture, the dampness of which affects the\r\nhealth, and causes personal uncleanliness, induced by the difficulty of\r\nkeeping a clean house. The operation of the same deteriorating\r\ninfluences were also observable in Scotland, and it may be illustrated\r\nby several instances which I have met with in the course of my own\r\npersonal inquiries.\r\n\r\nOne of the circumstances most favourable to the improvement of the\r\ncondition of an artisan or an agricultural labourer, is his obtaining as\r\na wife a female who has had a good industrial training in the well\r\nregulated household of persons of a higher condition. The following\r\ninstance of the effect of the dwelling itself on the condition of a\r\nfemale servant when married, was brought to my notice by a member of the\r\nfamily in which they had been brought up. One was of a young woman who\r\nhad been taught the habits of neatness, order, and cleanliness most\r\nthoroughly as regards household work.\r\n\r\n  “Her attention to personal neatness,” says a lady who is my informant,\r\n  “was very great; her face seemed always as if it were just washed, and\r\n  with her bright hair neatly combed underneath her snowwhite cap, a\r\n  smooth white apron, and her gown and handkerchief carefully put on,\r\n  she used to look very comely. After a year or two, she married the\r\n  serving man, who, as he was retained in his situation, was obliged to\r\n  take a house as near his place as possible. The cottages in the\r\n  neighbourhood were of the most wretched kind, mere hovels built of\r\n  rough stones and covered with ragged thatch; there were few even of\r\n  these, so there was no choice, and they were obliged to be content\r\n  with the first that was vacant, which was in the most retired\r\n  situation. After they had been married about two years, I happened to\r\n  be walking past one of these miserable cottages, and as the door was\r\n  open, I had the curiosity to enter. I found it was the home of the\r\n  servant I have been describing. But what a change had come over her!\r\n  Her face was dirty, and her tangled hair hung over her eyes. Her cap,\r\n  though of good materials, was ill washed and slovenly put on. Her\r\n  whole dress, though apparently good and serviceable, was very untidy,\r\n  and looked dirty and slatternly; everything indeed about her seemed\r\n  wretched and neglected, (except her little child,) and she appeared\r\n  very discontented. She seemed aware of the change there must be in her\r\n  appearance since I had last seen her, for she immediately began to\r\n  complain of her house. The wet came in at the door of the _only room_,\r\n  and when it rained, through every part of the roof also, except just\r\n  over the hearth-stone; large drops fell upon her as she lay in bed, or\r\n  as she was working at the window: in short, she had found it\r\n  impossible to keep things in order, so had gradually ceased to make\r\n  any exertions. Her condition had been borne down by the condition of\r\n  the house. Then her husband was dissatisfied with his home and with\r\n  her; his visits became less frequent, and if he had been a day\r\n  labourer, and there had been a beer-shop or a public-house, the\r\n  preference of that to his home would have been inevitable, and in the\r\n  one instance would have presented an example of a multitude of cases.\r\n\r\n  “She was afterwards, however, removed to a new cottage, which was\r\n  water-tight, and had some conveniences, and was built close to the\r\n  road, which her former mistress and all her friends must constantly\r\n  pass along. She soon resumed, in a great degree, her former good\r\n  habits, but still there was a little of the _dawdle_ left about her;\r\n  the remains of the dispiritedness caused by her former very\r\n  unfavourable circumstances.”\r\n\r\nI visited some other dwellings not far from the one above described, and\r\nmet with another instance of a female who had been brought up as a\r\nservant in a well-ordered house, and who, for her station, had received\r\na very excellent religious and moral education. Before her marriage she\r\nhad been distinguished by the refinement with which she sung national\r\nairs, and for her knowledge of the Bible and of the doctrines of her\r\nchurch. Her personal condition had become of “a piece” with the wretched\r\nstone undrained hovel, with a pigsty before it, in which she had been\r\ntaken. We found her with rings of dirt about her neck, and turning over\r\nwith dirty hands Brown’s Dictionary, to see whether the newly-elected\r\nminister was “sound” in his doctrine. In this case no moral lapse was\r\napparent, but the children were apparently brought up under great\r\ndisadvantages.\r\n\r\nThere, however, as in most cases, the internal economy of the houses\r\nwere primarily affected by the defective internal and surrounding\r\ndrainage that produced the damp and wet, and thence the dirt against\r\nwhich the inmates had ceased to contend. On inquiry of the male\r\nlabourers in the district, it appeared that almost every third man was\r\nsubjected to rheumatism; and with them, it was evident that the\r\nprevalence of damp and marsh miasma from the want of drainage, if it did\r\nnot necessitate, formed a strong temptation to, the use of ardent\r\nspirits. With them as with the females, the wretched condition of the\r\ntenement formed a strong barrier against personal cleanliness and the\r\nuse of decent clothes.\r\n\r\nIn the rural districts the very defects of the cottages which let in the\r\nfresh air, in spite of all the efforts of the inmates to exclude it,\r\noften obviate the effects of the overcrowding and defective ventilation.\r\nIt has been observed, that while the labouring population of several\r\ndistricts have had no shelter but huts, similar to those described by\r\nDr. Gilly, as the habitations of the border peasantry, which afforded a\r\nfree passage for currents of air, they were not subject to fevers,\r\nthough they were to rheumatism; but when, through the good intentions of\r\nthe proprietors, such habitations were provided as were deemed more\r\ncomfortable from excluding the weather effectually, but which, from the\r\nneglect of ventilation afforded recesses for stagnating air, and\r\nimpurities which they had not the means or had not a sufficient love of\r\ncleanliness to remove; though rheumatism was excluded, febrile infection\r\nwas generated. In the towns the access of the wind is impeded by the\r\ncloseness of the surrounding habitations, and the internal construction\r\nof the dwellings tends to exclude the air still more effectually. Were\r\nthe closed windows opened, it would frequently be only to admit a worse\r\ncompound, the air from neglected privies, and the miasma from the wet\r\nand undrained court or street.\r\n\r\nThe close pent up air in these abodes has, undoubtedly, a depressing\r\neffect on the nervous energies, and this again, with the uneducated, and\r\nindeed with many of the educated workpeople, has an effect on the moral\r\nhabits by acting as a strong and often irresistible provocative to the\r\nuse of fermented liquors and ardent spirits. Much may be due to the\r\nincitement of association of greater numbers of people, but it is a\r\ncommon fact that, the same workpeople indulge more in drink when living\r\nin the close courts and lanes of the town than when living in the\r\ncountry, and that the residence in the different places is attended with\r\na difference of effects similar to those described in respect to the\r\ntailors working in crowded rooms in towns and the tailors working\r\nseparately or in the country. The workpeople who have fallen into habits\r\nof drinking, strenuously allege the impossibility of avoiding the\r\npractice in such places; they do, however, drink in greater quantities\r\nin such places, and give increased effect to the noxious miasma by which\r\nthey are surrounded.\r\n\r\nSome inquiries from _Mr. Liddle_, the medical officer of the Whitechapel\r\nunion, as to the condition of the workpeople he visited in such places\r\nas he has described, brought to notice another indirect effect of the\r\nexternal as well as the internal condition of the dwelling on their\r\ndomestic economy and general condition.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that the persons whom he visited for the purpose of\r\nadministering medical relief, were men earning, when in work, from\r\n16_s._ to 20_s._ per week, the women earning proportionably. Yet\r\nwhenever they were subjected to the frequent attacks of sickness which\r\nprevailed amongst them, they were in the most, wretched destitution: the\r\nhouse was bare of everything; they had no provisions and no credit, and\r\ntheir need for relief was most imminent. In answer to the inquiry how\r\nthis was to be accounted for, inasmuch as with agricultural labourers\r\nwho earned little more than half that sum, and paid nearly as much for\r\ntheir food, in visiting their cottages with their ministers, I had\r\ncommonly observed some store of provisions; Mr. Liddle stated that in\r\nsuch places as those in his district, in such atmospheres, a store of\r\nprovisions would not keep: everything decayed rapidly, and the\r\nworkpeople consequently lived “from hand to mouth.” On inquiring as to\r\nthis fact from a respectable butcher, accustomed to sell meat to persons\r\nliving in such situations, he stated that—\r\n\r\n  “Meat sold on a Saturday night, in hot weather, to poor people, who\r\n  have only one close room, in which they sleep, and live, and cook,\r\n  will certainly turn before the Sunday morning; when, if it were kept\r\n  in the butcher’s shop, or in a well-ventilated place, it would be in\r\n  as good a condition on the Monday morning. There is a great deal of\r\n  loss of meat in consequence of the want of ventilation and bad\r\n  condition of the dwellings of the poorer classes. The butter kept in\r\n  such places sooner becomes rancid, and the bread dry and\r\n  disagreeable.”\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have from the one agent, a close and polluted atmosphere,\r\ntwo different sets of effects; the one set here noticed engendering\r\nimprovidence, expense, and waste,—the other, the depressing effects of\r\nexternal and internal miasma on the nervous system, tending to incite\r\nthe habitual use of ardent spirits; both tending to precipitate this\r\npopulation into disease and misery.\r\n\r\nThe familiarity with the sickness and death constantly present in the\r\ncrowded and unwholesome districts, appears to re-act as another\r\nconcurrent, cause in aggravation of the wretchedness and vice in which\r\nthey are plunged. Seeing the apparent uncertainty of the morrow, the\r\ninhabitants really take no heed of it, and abandon themselves with the\r\nrecklessness and avidity of common soldiers in a war to whatever gross\r\nenjoyment comes within their reach. All the districts I visited, where\r\nthe rate of sickness and mortality was high, presented, as might be\r\nexpected, a proportionate amount of severe cases of destitute orphanage\r\nand widowhood; and the same places were marked by excessive recklessness\r\nof the labouring population. In Dumfries, for example, it is estimated,\r\nthat the cholera, swept away one-eleventh part of the population. Until\r\nrecently, the town had not recovered the severe effects of the\r\nvisitation, and the condition of the orphans was most deplorable.\r\nAmongst young artisans who were earning from 16_s._ to 18_s._ a-week, I\r\nwas informed that there were very few who made any reserves against the\r\ncasualties of sickness. I was led to ask the provost what number of\r\nbakers’ shops there were? “Twelve,” was his answer. And what number of\r\nwhiskey-shops may the town possess? “Seventy-nine” was the reply. If we\r\nmight rely on the inquiries made of working-men when Dr. Arnott and I\r\nwent through the wynds of Edinburgh, their consumption of spirits bore\r\nalmost the like proportion to the consumption of wholesome food. We\r\nobserved to Captain Stuart, the superintendent of the police at\r\nEdinburgh, in our inspection of the wynds, that life appeared to be of\r\nlittle value, and was likely to be held cheap in such spots. He stated,\r\nin answer, that a short time ago a man had been executed for the murder\r\nof his wife in a fit of passion in the very room we had accidentally\r\nentered, and where we were led to make the observation. At a short\r\ndistance from that spot, and amidst others of this class of habitation,\r\nwere those which had been the scenes of the murders by Burke and Hare.\r\nYet amidst these were the residences of working men engaged in regular\r\nindustry. The indiscriminate mixture of workpeople and their children in\r\nthe immediate vicinity, and often in the same rooms with persons whose\r\ncharacter was denoted by the question and answer more than once\r\nexchanged, “When were you last washed?” “When I was last in prison,” was\r\nonly one mark of the entire degradation to which they had been brought.\r\nThe working-classes living in these districts were equally marked by the\r\nabandonment, of every civil or social regulation. Asking some children\r\nin one of the rooms of the wynds in which they swarmed in Glasgow what\r\nwere their names, they hesitated to answer, when one of the inmates\r\nsaid, they called them ——, mentioning some nicknames. “The fact is,”\r\nobserved Captain Miller, the superintendent of the police, “they really\r\nhave no names. Within this range of buildings I have no doubt I should\r\nbe able to find a thousand children who have no names whatever, or only\r\nnicknames, like dogs.” There were found amidst the occupants, labourers\r\nearning wages undoubtedly sufficient to have paid for comfortable\r\ntenements, men and women who were intelligent, and so far as could be\r\nascertained, had received the ordinary education which should have given\r\nbetter tastes and led to better habits. My own observations have been\r\nconfirmed by the statement of Mr. Sheriff Alison, of Glasgow, that in\r\nthe great manufacturing towns of Scotland, “in the contest with whiskey,\r\nin their crowded population, education has been entirely overthrown.”\r\nThe ministers, it will be seen, make similar reports from the rural\r\ndistricts. On the observation of other districts, and the comparison of\r\nthe habits of the same workmen in town and country, it will be seen that\r\nI consider that the use of the whiskey and the prostration of the\r\neducation and moral habits for which the Scottish labourers have been\r\ndistinguished is, to a considerable extent, attributable to the\r\nsurrounding physical circumstances, including the effects of the bad\r\nventilation. The labourers presented to our notice in the condition\r\ndescribed, in the crowded districts, were almost all Scotch. It is\r\ncommon to ascribe the extreme of misery and vice wholly to the Irish\r\nportion of the population of the towns in Scotland. A short inspection\r\non the spot would correct this error. Mr. Baird, in his report on the\r\nsanitary condition of the poor of Glasgow, observes that “the bad name\r\nof the poor Irish had been too long attached to them.” Dr. Cowan, of\r\nGlasgow, stated that “From ample opportunities of observation, they\r\nappeared to him to exhibit much less of that squalid misery and\r\naddiction to the use of ardent spirits than the Scotch of the same\r\ngrade.” Instances were indeed stated to us, where the Irish were\r\npreferred for employment from their superior steadiness and docility;\r\nand Mr. Stuart, the Factory Inspector for Scotland, states, that\r\n“instances are now occurring of a preference being given to them as\r\nworkers in the flax factories on account of their regular habits, and\r\nthat very significant hints have been given by extensive factory owners,\r\nthat Irish workmen will be selected unless the natives of the place, and\r\nother persons employed by them, relinquish the prevailing habits of\r\nintemperance.” Dr. Scott Alison, in his report on Tranent, has described\r\nthe population in receipt of high wages, but living under similar\r\ninfluences, as prone to passionate excitement, and as apt instruments\r\nfor political discontents; their moral perceptions appeared to have been\r\nobliterated, and they might be said to be characterised by a “ferocious\r\nindocility which makes them prompt to wrong and violence, destroys their\r\nsocial nature, and transforms them into something little better than\r\nwild beasts.”\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that the coincidence of pestilence and moral\r\ndisorder is not confined to one part of the island, nor to any one race\r\nof the population. The overcrowding and the removal of what may be\r\ntermed the architectural barriers or protections of decency and\r\npropriety, and the causes of physical deterioration in connexion with\r\nthe moral deterioration, are also fearfully manifest in the districts in\r\nEngland, which, at the time to which the evidence refers, were in a\r\nstate of prosperity.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Baker_, in his report on the condition of the population, after\r\ngiving an instance of the contrast presented by the working people\r\nliving in better dwellings, situated in better cleansed neighbourhoods\r\n(to which I shall advert when submitting the evidence in respect to\r\npreventive measures), describes the population living in houses—\r\n\r\n  “With broken panes in every window-frame, and filth and vermin in\r\n  every nook. With the walls unwhitewashed for years, black with the\r\n  smoke of foul chimneys, without water, with corded bed-stocks for\r\n  beds, and sacking for bed-clothing, with floors unwashed from year to\r\n  year, without out-offices, * * * * while without, there are streets,\r\n  elevated a foot, sometimes two, above the level of the causeway, by\r\n  the accumulation of years, and stagnant puddles here and there, with\r\n  their fœtid exhalations, causeways broken and dangerous, ash-places\r\n  choked up with filth, and excrementitious deposits on all sides as a\r\n  consequence, undrained, unpaved, unventilated, uncared-for by any\r\n  authority but the landlord, who weekly collects his miserable rents\r\n  from his miserable tenants.\r\n\r\n  “Can we wonder that such places are the hot-beds of disease, or that\r\n  it obtains, upon constitutions thus liberally predisposed to receive\r\n  it, and forms the mortality which Leeds exhibits. Adult life, exposed\r\n  to such miasmata, gives way. How much more then infant life, when\r\n  ushered into, and attempted to be reared in, such obnoxious\r\n  atmospheres. On the moral habits similar effects are produced. An\r\n  inattention on the part of the local authorities to the state of the\r\n  streets diminishes year by year the respectability of their occupiers.\r\n  None dwell in such localities but to whom propinquity to employment is\r\n  absolutely essential. Those who might advocate a better state of\r\n  things, depart; and of those who remain, the one-half, by repeated\r\n  exhibitions of indecency and vulgarity, and indeed by the mere fact of\r\n  neighbourship, sink into the moral degradation which is natural to the\r\n  other, and vicious habits and criminal propensities precede the death\r\n  which these combinations prepare.”\r\n\r\nNo education as yet commonly given appears to have availed against such\r\ndemoralizing circumstances as those described; but the cases of moral\r\nimprovement of a population, by cleansing, draining, and the improvement\r\nof the internal and external conditions of the dwellings, of which\r\ninstances will be presented, are more numerous and decided, though there\r\nstill occur instances of persons in whom the love of ardent spirits has\r\ngained such entire possession as to have withstood all such means of\r\nretrieving them. The most experienced public officers acquainted with\r\nthe condition of the inferior population of the towns would agree in\r\ngiving the first place in efficiency and importance to the removal of\r\nwhat may be termed the physical barriers to improvement, and that as\r\nagainst such barriers moral agencies have but a remote chance of\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nA gentleman who has had considerable experience in the management of\r\nlarge numbers of the manufacturing population stated to me that in every\r\ncase of personal and moral improvement the successful step was made by\r\nthe removal of the party from the ill-conditioned neighbourhood in which\r\nhe had been brought up. When a young workman married, he interfered to\r\nget him a better residence apart from the rest; and when this was done\r\nimportant alterations followed; but if he took up his abode in the old\r\nneighbourhood, the condition of the wife was soon brought down to the\r\ncommon level, and the marriage became a source of wretchedness.\r\n\r\nBenevolent persons, viewing the bare aspect of some of the most\r\nafflicted neighbourhoods, have raised subscriptions for the purchase of\r\nfurniture, bedding, and blankets, for the relief of the inmates, but by\r\nthis pecuniary aid they have only added fuel to the flame; that is, they\r\nhave enabled the inmates to purchase more ardent spirits. The force of\r\nthe habit, which is aggravated by misdirected charity, is indicated in\r\nthe following instances, of which one was mentioned to me by the _Rev.\r\nWhitwell Elwin_:—\r\n\r\n  “I was lately informed by a master tailor of Bath that one of his men,\r\n  who had earned 3_l._ a-week at piece-work for years, had never within\r\n  his knowledge possessed table, chairs, or bedding. I found the\r\n  statement on examination to be strictly true. Some straw on which he\r\n  slept, a square block of wood, a low three-legged stool, and an old\r\n  tea-caddy, are the complete inventory of the articles of a room, the\r\n  occupier of which, with only himself and his wife to maintain, was\r\n  wealthier than many in the station of gentlemen. He had frequently\r\n  excited lively compassion in benevolent individuals, who, supposing\r\n  that he was struggling for very existence, furnished him with a\r\n  variety of household goods, which were regularly pawned before a week\r\n  was out, and afforded to the superficial observer fresh evidence of\r\n  the extremity of his distress. The cause of all this is quickly told:\r\n  the wife was to be seen going to and fro several times a-day with a\r\n  cream-jug of gin, and to gratify this appetite, they had voluntarily\r\n  reduced themselves to the condition of savages. I could add numerous\r\n  instances of a similar kind. Indeed, were a stranger to go through the\r\n  town, and judge only from the appearance of things, I am convinced\r\n  that he would select his examples of greatest privation not from the\r\n  really poor, but from men who were in the receipt of more than 30_s._\r\n  a-week. Charity, which when prompted by pure motives, always blesses\r\n  him that gives, does not always bless him that takes. I am afraid that\r\n  the indiscriminate adoption of dirt and rags as a test of poverty,\r\n  especially in a town like Bath, where private charity prevails on an\r\n  extensive scale, operates as a premium upon ill habits, and as a\r\n  discouragement to cleanliness, and leads many to affect a vice which\r\n  was not habitual to them.”\r\n\r\nAs an instance of that state of voluntary wretchedness which renders all\r\nsuch charity or assistance worse than useless, I may give an incident\r\nmentioned to me by _Sir Charles Shaw_, the chief commissioner of the new\r\npolice force in Manchester:—\r\n\r\n  “A week since,” says Sir Charles, “I sent an inspector of police to\r\n  examine a lodging-house. He came back to state that he had never\r\n  witnessed such a sight. He found in one room, totally destitute of\r\n  furniture, three men and two women lying on the bare floor, without\r\n  straw, and with bricks only for their pillows. I observed, that I\r\n  supposed they were drunk. ‘Yes,’ said the inspector; ‘they were, and I\r\n  found the lodging-house keeper himself in a tolerable bed, and in\r\n  another room I found bundles of fine fresh straw. I blamed the man for\r\n  not giving that straw to his lodgers.’ He answered, ‘I keep that straw\r\n  for the people who prefer purchasing it to gin: those above stairs\r\n  preferred the gin.’ It is, I find, a common thing here for\r\n  lodging-house keepers to have straw for sale.”\r\n\r\nIn the course of an examination which I took, under the Poor Law\r\nCommission of Inquiry, from the late _Mr. Walker_, the stipendiary\r\nmagistrate of the Thames Police Office, he observed, in respect to cases\r\nof apparent destitution:—\r\n\r\n  “Casualties occurring among the indigent or profligate are at all\r\n  times liable to be represented as cases resulting from the neglect of\r\n  the proper authorities. Some time ago, in going round the parish of\r\n  Whitechapel with the churchwardens, during service-time, we entered an\r\n  old building in Rosemary-lane, for which there was then no owner, the\r\n  stairs were so dark and ruinous that though it was mid-day we were\r\n  obliged to have a candle, to enable us to go up to them: the\r\n  first-floor was the receptacle of every description of filth. We\r\n  entered one room, in which we found two half-naked dirty children;\r\n  their mother lay in one corner on some dirty straw, covered only with\r\n  a sack. There was no furniture nor other articles in the place, except\r\n  a fagot of wood and a few broken plates, a basket of skate, and some\r\n  sprats strewed on the floor. This woman was a fish-hawker, a business\r\n  by which, in all probability, she gained enough to have made her\r\n  extremely comfortable, but she preferred an alternation of great\r\n  privation and profligate enjoyment. Had she accidentally died in this\r\n  state, here would have been a scene of misery, and a case of\r\n  excitement for the philanthropists! In our district there are other\r\n  premises under similar circumstances, all of which are tenanted by\r\n  persons of the very lowest grade; and it is surprising, considering\r\n  the state in which they live, that unaccountable deaths, having the\r\n  semblance of starvation, do not take place amongst them. From what I\r\n  have observed of these places, I am fully convinced that if shambles\r\n  were built on any spot, and all who choose were allowed to occupy\r\n  them, they would soon be occupied by a race lower than any yet known.\r\n  I have often said that if empty casks were placed along the streets of\r\n  Whitechapel, in a few days each of them would have a tenant, and these\r\n  tenants would keep up their kind, and prey upon the rest of the\r\n  community. I am sure that if such facilities were offered, there is no\r\n  conceivable degradation to which portions of the species might not be\r\n  reduced. Allow these tub-men no education, and you would have so many\r\n  savages living in the midst of civilization. Wherever there are empty\r\n  houses which are not secured, they are soon tenanted by wretched\r\n  objects, and these tenants continue so long as there is a harbour for\r\n  them. Parish officers and others come to me to aid them in clearing\r\n  such places. I tell the police and the parish that there is no use in\r\n  their watching these places, that they must board them up if they\r\n  would get rid of the occupants. If they will give the accommodation\r\n  they will get the occupants. If you will have marshes and stagnant\r\n  waters you will there have suitable animals, and the only way of\r\n  getting rid of them is by draining the marshes.”\r\n\r\nThe _Reverend Whitwell Elwin_ observes upon this subject that—\r\n\r\n  “Those who think that labourers will work for themselves a reform in\r\n  their habitations very much underrate the effects of habit. A person\r\n  accustomed to fresh air, and all the comforts of civilized life, goes\r\n  into a miserable room, dirty, bare, and, above all, sickening from the\r\n  smell. Judging from his own sensations, he conceives that nothing but\r\n  the most abject poverty could have produced this state of things, and\r\n  he can imagine nothing necessary to a cure but a way for escape. A\r\n  very simple experiment will correct these erroneous impressions. Let\r\n  him remain a short time in the room, and the perception of closeness\r\n  will so entirely vanish that he will almost fancy that the atmosphere\r\n  has been purified since his entrance. There are few who are not\r\n  familiar with this fact; and if such are the effects of an hour in\r\n  blunting our refined sensations, and rendering them insensible to\r\n  noxious exhalations, what must be the influence of years on the\r\n  coarser perceptions of the working-man?\r\n\r\n  “All who know the lower classes will testify that the last want felt\r\n  by the dirty is cleanliness, that their last expenditure is on the\r\n  comforts of their home. Two winters ago I found a painter whose bed\r\n  was without blankets, whose room was without furniture, who was\r\n  destitute even of the ordinary utensils of civilized life, whose floor\r\n  was covered with worse filth than that of the streets—I found this man\r\n  at dinner with a roast loin of pork stuffed with onions, a Yorkshire\r\n  pudding, a large jug of ale, cheese, and a salad. I will undertake to\r\n  say that half the gentlemen in Bath did not sit down on that Sunday to\r\n  so good a dinner.”\r\n\r\nA number of communications simply assign “intemperance” as the cause of\r\nfever, and of the prevalent mortality. Of most of these communications,\r\nwhich it were unnecessary to recite, it may be observed, that when\r\nintemperance is mentioned as the cause of disease, as being the\r\nimmediate antecedent, on carrying investigation a little further back,\r\ndiscomfort is found to be the immediate antecedent to the intemperance;\r\nand where the external causes of positive discomfort do not prevail in\r\nthe towns, the workpeople are generally found to have few or no rival\r\npleasures to wean them from habits of intemperance, and to have come\r\nfrom districts subject to the discomforts likely to engender them. In\r\none of the returns from Scotland it is observed that with the people,\r\nwhether for a fever, a cold, or consumption, or a pleurisy, whiskey is\r\nthe universal antidote. The popular belief that fermented liquor or\r\nardent spirits are proper antidotes to the effects of damp or cold has\r\nbeen universal, and has not wanted even medical sanction. Out-door\r\nallowances of beer have been prescribed by some medical officers in\r\nmarshy and undrained districts as the proper preservatives against ague\r\nor rheumatism. The Board will now be in a position to urge the\r\nimportance of facilitating drainage as a means for the protection of the\r\npopulation by the prevention of disease and the inducement to pernicious\r\nhabits, as well as a source of profitable industry. It is now beginning\r\nto be observed in several dangerous occupations that temperance is the\r\nbest means of withstanding the effects of the noxious agencies which\r\nthey have to encounter. Amongst the painters, for example, the men who\r\nare temperate and cleanly suffer little from the occupation, but if any\r\none of them become intemperate, the noxious causes take effect with a\r\ncertainty and rapidity proportioned to the relaxed domestic habits. The\r\nInquiry presents many instances of the beneficial effects of the changes\r\nof the popular habit of having recourse to fermented liquors or to\r\nspirits as necessary protective stimulants. In several of the mining\r\ndistricts, for example, it is an extensive practice to provide for the\r\naccommodation of the miners out of the hot mines a room in which they\r\nmay drink beer as a preservative against the effects of the change to\r\nthe cold and damp air to which they are about to expose themselves. _Dr.\r\nBarham_, in his Report to the Commissioners appointed to inquire into\r\nthe Employment of Young Persons in Mines and Manufactories, notices an\r\nadmirable example within the province of voluntary exertion, and the\r\nbeneficial effects produced by it at the Dolcoath copper and tin mine,\r\nCamborne, Cornwall. There the proprietors, besides establishing other\r\neasy and economical preventive arrangements, provide a warm room for the\r\nminers to change their dresses and take hot meat-soup, which is cheaper,\r\nprobably, than beer. “And the men” (says a witness) “say they never feel\r\ncold when they take it. We conceive that there have been much fewer\r\ncases of consumption on the club since this practice has been adopted.”\r\n\r\nThe effects of the noxious physical agencies on the moral condition of\r\nthe population will receive more full illustration in connexion with the\r\nstatistical evidence as to their effects, with the evidence on the\r\npractical operation of the means of prevention.\r\n\r\n\r\n       _Domestic mismanagement, a predisposing cause of disease._\r\n\r\nThe subsequent examples relate chiefly to the effects of general\r\ndomestic mismanagement as a concurrent cause of disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dr. Baker_, in his report on the sanitary condition of the population\r\nof Derby, states that—\r\n\r\n  “There is also another cause of sickness to be found in their houses,\r\n  and which, like the former, _i. e._, the external circumstances, is in\r\n  constant operation: I mean the want of domestic comforts, a want which\r\n  the wages they earn would, in many instances, enable them to remove if\r\n  their means were not, as too often happens, expended viciously or\r\n  improvidently. It is with regret that I speak unfavourably of the\r\n  poor, whilst my whole aim, in this communication, has been to awaken a\r\n  sympathy towards those sufferings of which I have been so often a\r\n  witness. But several years’ experience of the habits of the poor,\r\n  derived from my situation as an hospital physician, and backed by the\r\n  additional evidence I have obtained by acting for three years as a\r\n  guardian of the poor in this large town, has, I am sorry to say,\r\n  served but to confirm me in the opinion I have just now expressed; and\r\n  in support of which I shall instance the family of the Slaters\r\n  mentioned at No. 12, in Short-street.\r\n\r\n  “The earnings of four members of this family were as follows:—\r\n\r\n                              _s._ _d._\r\n The father                     14    0 per week, at gardening, &c.\r\n The eldest son, aged 20        12    0 per week, at a brewery.\r\n Daughter {Twins, }              6    0 per week, at a factory.\r\n Son      {aged 18}              9    0 per week, at the same factory.\r\n                           ——   ——    —\r\n                           £2    1    0 per week.\r\n\r\n  “The mother of this family, it appears, is left disengaged from all\r\n  but her household duties and the care of the younger children; the\r\n  house, nevertheless, is nearly destitute of furniture, and presents a\r\n  picture of disorder and want. On the other hand, at No. 15, (Briggs)\r\n  although the husband has for some years past been a weak and ailing\r\n  man, the family is well ordered and cleanly; and to this fact I mainly\r\n  attribute the milder and modified form of fever which affected the\r\n  children.”\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Physicians and Surgeons at Birmingham, in their report,\r\nindicate the powerful operation of depraved domestic habits as a\r\npredisposing cause to disease:—\r\n\r\n  “It cannot,” they say, “be doubted that whilst the arts and\r\n  manufactures of the place prove in some instances injurious to health,\r\n  and in a few possibly destructive to life, these evil consequences, as\r\n  well as hereditary predisposition to disease, are promoted by\r\n  intemperance, not that intemperance is an infinitely more frequent\r\n  cause of disease and death amongst the artisans than all the various\r\n  employments of all the manufactories combined.\r\n\r\n  “In the expenditure of their weekly earnings, improvidence and\r\n  thoughtless extravagance prevail to a lamentable degree. The\r\n  observations upon which this opinion is formed are made upon the\r\n  habits of the people themselves, confirmed by extensive and recent\r\n  inquiries among the shopkeepers with whom they deal. Tea, coffee,\r\n  sugar, butter, cheese, bacon, (of which a great deal is consumed in\r\n  this town,) and other articles, the working people purchase in small\r\n  quantities from the hucksters, who charge an enormous profit upon\r\n  them, being, as they state, compelled to do so to cover the losses\r\n  which they frequently sustain by bad debts. Huckster dealing is a most\r\n  extravagant mode of dealing; there were in this town, in 1834, 717 of\r\n  these shops, and the number has greatly increased since that time.\r\n  Meat is purchased in the same improvident manner; the working men\r\n  generally contrive to have a good joint of meat upon the Sunday; the\r\n  dinner on the other days of the week is made from steaks or chops,\r\n  which is the most extravagant mode either of purchasing or cooking\r\n  meat.\r\n\r\n  “The improvidence of this class of persons arises in many instances\r\n  from the indulgence of vicious propensities. Drunkenness, with all its\r\n  attendant miseries, prevails to a great extent, though it is by no\r\n  means to be regarded as a characteristic feature of the mechanic of\r\n  this town in particular. It most generally prevails among that class\r\n  of workmen who obtain the highest wages, but who are often found in\r\n  the most deplorable and abject condition. The improvidence of which we\r\n  are speaking is to be traced in very many instances to extreme\r\n  ignorance on the part of the wives of these people. The females are\r\n  from necessity bred up from their youth in the workshops, as the\r\n  earnings of the younger members contribute to the support of the\r\n  family. The minds and morals of the girls become debased, and they\r\n  marry totally ignorant of all those habits of domestic economy which\r\n  tend to render a husband’s home comfortable and happy; and this is\r\n  very often the cause of the man being driven to the alehouse to seek\r\n  that comfort after his day of toil which he looks for in vain by his\r\n  own fireside. The habit of a manufacturing life being once established\r\n  in a woman, she continues it, and leaves her home and children to the\r\n  care of a neighbour or of a hired child, sometimes only a few years\r\n  older than her own children, whose services cost her probably as much\r\n  as she obtains for her labour. To this neglect on the part of their\r\n  parents is to be traced the death of many children; they are left in\r\n  the house with a fire before they are old enough to know the danger to\r\n  which they are exposed, and are often dreadfully burnt.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mott’s_ report on the sanitary condition of the population of his\r\ndistrict presents parallel instances of the different economy prevalent\r\namongst these classes:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Contrast in the Economy of Families._\r\n\r\n                 1.                                  1.\r\n\r\n Cellar in Wellington-court,         In a dwelling-house in Chorlton\r\n Chorlton-upon-Medlock; a man, his   Union, containing one sitting-room\r\n wife and seven children; income per and two bed-rooms; a man, his wife\r\n week, 1_l._ 11_s._; rent 1_s._      and three children; rent 2_s._\r\n 6_d._ per week; three beds for      6_d._ per week; income per week\r\n seven, in a dark, unventilated back 12_s._ 6_d._, being an average of\r\n room, bed-covering of the meanest   2_s._ 6_d._ per week for each\r\n and scantiest kind—the man and wife person.

I have been convinced from extensive\r\n  observation, that the masters of these people have it in their power\r\n  to improve the condition and happiness of their workpeople beyond what\r\n  can be effected by any other agency.”\r\n\r\nThese descriptions are not confined to the English towns. Mr. Jupp and\r\nothers cite instances from the rural districts. They are similarly\r\nprevalent in Scotland. As an example I would refer to the description\r\ngiven by Dr. Scott Alison, of the condition of the highly-paid collier\r\npopulation of Tranent. Take another instance of the condition of the\r\nsame class, the colliers at Ayr, given by _Dr. Sym_, in his report on\r\nthe sanitary condition of the population of that town:—\r\n\r\n  “Although the colliers have large wages, they are, from their want of\r\n  economy and their dissolute habits, uniformly in poverty; and their\r\n  families, though well fed, are miserably clothed, ill lodged,\r\n  uneducated, and less industrious than the families of the weavers; the\r\n  females of which work with great constancy at hand-sewing. The modes\r\n  of living of these two classes are very different. The weaver is not\r\n  intemperate, because he cannot afford to purchase ardent spirits, and\r\n  the nature of his employment prevents him from having those hours of\r\n  idleness during the day which the collier is so apt to consume in\r\n  dissipation. He lives on very innutritious food, seldom eats butchers’\r\n  meat, and the most indigent, who are generally Irishmen, subsist\r\n  chiefly on potatoes. The collier, on the other hand, indulges to\r\n  excess in ardent spirits, and both he and his family partake of animal\r\n  food every day. In short, the colliers live better than any of the\r\n  other labouring classes in Ayr.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. Scott Alison_, speaking of the colliers of Tranent, states that\r\nthey obtain very high wages. “A man, his wife, and perhaps two children\r\nmay earn perhaps 40_s._ a-week, if industriously employed during that\r\ntime.” On the subject of appearances of destitution, on which medical\r\nmen sometimes report, he observes—\r\n\r\n  “I have had occasion to know that medical men, judging from internal\r\n  appearances of the dwellings of the labouring classes, are liable to\r\n  be led into erroneous inferences as to the extent of destitution. The\r\n  appearance of the place or of the person is no test of the want of\r\n  means or of the highness or lowness of wages. Filth is more frequently\r\n  evidence of depravity than of destitution; indeed, in places where the\r\n  wages or means are really scanty, there is very frequently\r\n  considerable cleanliness. If a stranger went into the house of a\r\n  collier, he might exclaim, ‘What extreme wretchedness and\r\n  destitution!’ when, in fact, on the Saturday they had received 30_s._,\r\n  which before the Tuesday had all been squandered. I think medical men,\r\n  who are not intimately acquainted with the character of people, are\r\n  often drawn into mistakes.”\r\n\r\nThe domestic condition of this population admits of a contrast with the\r\ncondition of individuals of their own description of employment, or with\r\nthe condition of other classes of miners who receive no higher wages,\r\nbut whose condition is highly superior, to show that the depraved habits\r\nand condition are not the necessary result of the employment. He\r\ncontrasts the condition of the colliery population of Tranent with the\r\ncondition of the agricultural labourers in the immediate vicinity of the\r\ntown:—\r\n\r\n  “With very few exceptions, the condition of the interior of the houses\r\n  of the hind population is excellent, most pleasing to the eye, and\r\n  comfortable. These respectable people, in spite of the defective\r\n  construction of their cottages, manage to throw an air of comfort,\r\n  plenty, neatness, and order around their homes. I have often been\r\n  delighted to observe these characteristics, and not less so to mark\r\n  the co-existence of pure, moral, and religious principles in the\r\n  inmates, the presence of practical religion and practical morals. When\r\n  the floor wears away, it is repaired; when the walls lose their\r\n  whiteness, they are whitewashed; and every few days the whole wooden\r\n  furniture in the house is subjected to thorough cleansing with sand\r\n  and warm water. The various articles of furniture, and the different\r\n  household utensils, are kept in places allotted to them; and the\r\n  earthenware and china well cleaned, are neatly arranged, and made to\r\n  serve as ornaments to the apartment. The metal spoons, candlesticks,\r\n  and pitchers for containing milk and water, are well burnished. The\r\n  milk taken from the cow may be seen set apart in vessels kept in the\r\n  nicest order; and beside them lie the churning-barrel and strainer. A\r\n  fire sheds its cheerful influence over the scene; the kettle never\r\n  wants hot water; and the honest, frugal housewife is ever discharging\r\n  some household duty in a spirit of placid contentment, attending to\r\n  her partner when present, or preparing his meals against his return\r\n  from the fields.\r\n\r\n  “The external economy of the houses of the hinds is on the whole very\r\n  good. The ground in front of the cottages is kept clean and free of\r\n  impurities. The little garden, which is almost invariably connected\r\n  with the cottage, is kept in good order, and is in general well\r\n  cultivated.”\r\n\r\nThe like contrast, derived from an intimate knowledge of the population\r\nof another class, is presented in the following portions of a report\r\nfrom _Mr. Wood_, of Dundee:—\r\n\r\n  “There are many families among the working classes who are in the\r\n  receipt of from 15_s._ to 22_s._ per week, who are insufficiently\r\n  clothed, and irregularly and poorly fed, and whose houses as well as\r\n  their persons appear filthy, disorderly, and uncomfortable. There are\r\n  other families among them, containing the same number of persons,\r\n  whose incomes average from 10_s._ to 14_s._ a-week, who are neatly,\r\n  cleanly, and sufficiently clothed, regularly and suitably fed, and\r\n  whose houses appear orderly and comfortable. The former class care\r\n  little for the physical comfort, and far less for the intellectual,\r\n  moral, and religious education of their children; in many cases,\r\n  indeed, they neglect the education of their offspring when it is\r\n  offered to them gratuitously, and in place of sending them to school,\r\n  where they might be fitted for the duties and disappointments of life,\r\n  they send them at a very early age to some employment, where they will\r\n  earn the poor pittance of 1_s._ 6_d._ to 3_s._ a-week. The latter\r\n  class, on the contrary, are most anxious to give their children a good\r\n  education: they study to obtain it for them by every means in their\r\n  power, and they pay for it most cheerfully. The former class again\r\n  grasp at every benefit which the charitable institutions of the place\r\n  have provided for the poor. When, for example, medical attendance is\r\n  given them gratuitously, they not unfrequently despise and refuse it,\r\n  unless medicines are given them gratuitously also. Whereas the latter\r\n  description of families are not only ready and willing to pay for\r\n  medicines when prescribed to them, but they generally manifest much\r\n  gratitude, and very often present their medical attendant with a small\r\n  fee.\r\n\r\n  “Now it is among the former class of families where generally there\r\n  appears to me to be a deficiency of wholesome food and of warm\r\n  clothing; where contagious, febrile diseases are most commonly found;\r\n  and from whence they are most extensively propagated. Fever is no\r\n  doubt found among the latter, more frugal, and therefore better\r\n  conditioned families, but seldom of that malignant, contagious\r\n  character which it invariably assumes among the other class of\r\n  families. Here, then, we have on the one hand, filth, destitution, and\r\n  disease, associated with good wages; and on the other, cleanliness,\r\n  comfort, and comparative good health, in connexion with wages which\r\n  are much lower. The difference in the amount of their incomes does not\r\n  account for the difference in the amount of comfort which is found\r\n  existing among the working classes. The statements just made make\r\n  known the fact, that above a certain amount, say 12_s._ or 14_s._ of\r\n  weekly income, wages _alone_, without intelligence and good habits,\r\n  contributes nothing towards the comfort, health, and independence of\r\n  the working population. * * * Were I asked how I would propose to\r\n  relieve such a family, I would say, show them how they may live\r\n  comfortably within their incomes; let them be taught and trained to\r\n  habits of industry, frugality, sobriety, cleanliness, &c., and with\r\n  this 12_s._ or 14_s._ they may live in health and happiness as others\r\n  in similar circumstances have lived and are now living. The man who\r\n  maintains himself and his family in comfort on 12_s._ or 14_s._ of\r\n  weekly income, possesses what he well deserves, happiness at home, and\r\n  he stands forth in his neighbourhood a noble example of honest\r\n  independence. I am persuaded that the filth, fever, and destitution in\r\n  many families is occasioned, not by their small incomes, but by a\r\n  misapplication or a prodigal waste of a part, in some cases a great\r\n  part, of their otherwise sufficient wages. Frequently cases are found\r\n  where, with a want of skill and economy, there is combined the\r\n  intemperate use of intoxicating liquors, and here the misery may be\r\n  said to be complete.\r\n\r\n  “Such is the explanation which I have to offer regarding much of the\r\n  misery now prevalent, and it is the explanation invariably given by\r\n  the economical working classes themselves when questioned on the\r\n  subject. Heads of families, having three or four children, whose\r\n  incomes average from 14_s._ to 18_s._ per week, have assured me that a\r\n  man with a wife and three or four children can live comfortably on\r\n  12_s._ or 14_s._ a-week; and they generally account for the misery and\r\n  destitution existing among families by saying, that many who have good\r\n  wages reduce themselves to poverty and deprive themselves of\r\n  sufficient food and clothing by their mismanagement, want of\r\n  frugality, and drinking practices. Cases of waste and dissipation have\r\n  been related to me, where the husband having gone to the\r\n  tippling-house to enjoy his glass and his friend, the wife, knowing\r\n  this, sent for her bottle and her friend, and enjoyed herself at home.\r\n  A single visit to one of these spendthrift families, who are in the\r\n  receipt of good wages, would convince any one that their persons and\r\n  houses might be far more orderly, clean, and comfortable, were they\r\n  but half trained to the tastes and habits of household industry,\r\n  sobriety, and economy.”\r\n\r\nThe more closely the investigation as to the causes of epidemic disease\r\nis carried the more have the grounds been narrowed on which any\r\npresumption can be raised that it is generally occasioned by extreme\r\nindigence, or that it could be made generally to disappear simply by\r\ngrants of money.\r\n\r\nIn the great mass of cases in every part of the country, in the rural\r\ndistricts and in the places of commercial pressure, the attacks of\r\ndisease are upon those in full employment, the attack of fever precedes\r\nthe destitution, not the destitution the disease. There is strong\r\nevidence of the existence of a large class of persons in severe penury\r\nin some places, as in Glasgow, being subject to fever, but the fever\r\npatients did not, as a class, present evidence of being in destitution\r\nin any of the places we examined. _Dr. William Davidson_, the senior\r\nphysician of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, who has written a Treatise on\r\nthe Sources and Propagation of Continued Fevers, for which the prize\r\ninstituted by Dr. Thackeray, of Chester, was unanimously awarded at the\r\nannual meeting of the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association,\r\nstates in that treatise, when speaking of the influence of delicacy of\r\nconstitution as a predisposing cause of fever,—\r\n\r\n  “We have kept a record of the physical habit of the patients admitted\r\n  into the Glasgow Fever Hospital from May 1st to November 1st, 1839,\r\n  and the following were the divisions adopted:—\r\n\r\n  “1. Moderate, by which is meant a person having an ordinary quantity\r\n  of muscle and cellular substance.\r\n\r\n  “2. Full or plethoric, having an extra quantity of adipose texture or\r\n  of blood.\r\n\r\n  “3. Muscular.\r\n\r\n  “4. Spare.\r\n\r\n  “5.

The spare and unhealthy, when added\r\n  together, only form about 17 per cent. of the whole number.”\r\n\r\nHe gives two tables of the proportionate numbers of persons admitted,\r\nduring the year 1839, into the Glasgow Fever Hospital, whose persons\r\nwere clean or filthy:—\r\n\r\n  “These two tables show that, among 611 cases admitted as continued\r\n  fever, there were 340 filthy and 271 clean, or about 55 per cent.\r\n  filthy; that among 395 cases of eruptive typhus, there were 245 filthy\r\n  and 150 clean, or about 62 per cent. filthy; and that among 48 cases\r\n  of febricula there were 14 filthy and 34 clean, or about 29 per cent.\r\n  filthy.”\r\n\r\nAmongst the fever patients are found a larger proportion of the highly\r\nintemperate than appear to be usually found amongst the labouring\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Davidson_, in remarking on the influence of intemperance on fever,\r\nadduces the following table to show the proportion of temperate and\r\nintemperate individuals who were admitted into the Glasgow Fever\r\nHospital from November 1st, 1838, to November 1st, 1839, whose habits\r\ncould be ascertained with more or less certainty. He states that the\r\neruptive cases only are included:—\r\n\r\n                      Temperate. A little Intemperate. Intemperate.\r\n     Typhus (MALES)          125                    51           73\r\n     Typhus (FEMALES)         76                     8           30\r\n\r\nI have been informed that those were classed as “temperate” who never\r\nindulged in strong liquors to the extent of inebriety; those a “little\r\nintemperate” who now and again, perhaps at long intervals, drank to\r\nintoxication; and those as “intemperate” who were habitually so—who\r\ndrank whenever they could get ardent spirits.\r\n\r\nHe adds,—\r\n\r\n  “In the Glasgow Fever Hospital there occurred 81 deaths from eruptive\r\n  typhus in individuals whose habits were ascertained, and 34 of these\r\n  were reported as intemperate, 19 a little intemperate, and 28\r\n  temperate. In Dr. Craigie’s table of the deaths in 31 fever cases that\r\n  occurred in the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, there were 15 stated to be\r\n  irregular or dissipated; only two regular; the habits of the remainder\r\n  are not stated.\r\n\r\n  “It is also a singular fact, which has been noticed by several\r\n  writers, that fever is more fatal among the higher than among the\r\n  lower classes. Dr. Braken states, in reference to the fever which\r\n  prevailed at Waterford during the years 1817–18–19, that ‘it would be\r\n  difficult to adjust the rates of mortality in the upper classes, but\r\n  it seems probable that one-fourth, or perhaps one-third of all those\r\n  persons who were attacked with fever fell victims to its power.’\r\n\r\n  “Drs. Barker and Cheyne, in their historical account of the Irish\r\n  epidemic, state that, ‘in every part of the country, fever was\r\n  reported to have been much more fatal amongst the upper than the lower\r\n  classes.’ To what is this difference of mortality, so generally\r\n  remarked by experienced hospital physicians, to be attributed, and\r\n  which in Ireland seemed to be very remarkable, namely, in the lower\r\n  classes about one in twenty-three cases, and in the upper classes one\r\n  in three or four generally, but in other places about one in seven?\r\n  Can the difference in the mode of living account for this anomaly? as\r\n  the first live very much on potatoes, while the others use a larger or\r\n  smaller proportion of animal food; and the lower classes almost\r\n  everywhere in this country use less animal food and stimulating dishes\r\n  than those who are more wealthy and in a higher sphere of society.”\r\n\r\nIn remarking on the supposed influence of fear and the depressing\r\npassions in producing fever, _Dr. Davidson_, however, remarks:—\r\n\r\n  “The influence of fear and the depressing passions has also been\r\n  considered as very powerful in predisposing persons to be affected\r\n  with typhus contagion. There can be no doubt that fear has a tendency\r\n  to produce a temporary depression of the physical powers; but, as has\r\n  been already shown, there is no proof that persons of a naturally\r\n  spare or weak habit of body, who are generally very sensitive, are\r\n  more liable to fever than those of an ordinary constitution; this\r\n  opinion must also be considered hypothetical. Indeed the facts, as far\r\n  as our inquiries have enabled us to judge, seem to prove that the\r\n  apprehension of fever, more particularly when it is not epidemic, is\r\n  very rarely felt until the person is actually seized with the disease;\r\n  for some cannot recollect of a single circumstance by which they could\r\n  be exposed to contagion; and a considerable number of those who had\r\n  undoubtedly been exposed to it were only made aware of the fact when\r\n  it had been elicited by cross-examination. We are quite aware that\r\n  cases may be brought forward of sensitive individuals who have been\r\n  seized with fever soon after visiting a person labouring under the\r\n  disease; but as this fact can be opposed with at least an equal number\r\n  of persons who were destitute of fear, and yet caught it after an\r\n  exposure to contagion, no conclusion whatever can be drawn from them.\r\n  It must be observed, however, that though there is no proof that\r\n  persons who are naturally weak in body or of a sensitive disposition\r\n  are more susceptible of fever than those who are naturally vigorous\r\n  and robust, yet that, during famine or commercial distress, poverty,\r\n  by depressing the mind and lowering the physical status from\r\n  insufficient aliment, does powerfully predispose a community to become\r\n  affected with fever. This has been already shown in a former part of\r\n  the essay, and has been again alluded to in order that the distinction\r\n  might be made between an individual of naturally weak mental and\r\n  physical stamina, and one who has been reduced to that state by\r\n  deficient nutriment.”\r\n\r\nThere appears to be little evidence on one side or the other in support\r\nof this last hypothesis, other than such as that cited from Dr. Davidson\r\nhimself; but it is to be observed that the wet or bad seasons, which\r\nsuspend agricultural industry and much labour in the towns, is usually\r\nof a character of itself to predispose to disease, if not to produce it;\r\nand that it does propagate it amongst all classes, high and low, in\r\nproportion to their exposure to it. It appears to be highly probable\r\nthat the privation attendant on the stoppage of work, by diminishing the\r\nmeans for the purchase of fuel, of soap, &c., and in various ways by\r\ninducing lax habits of life, may increase the amount of exposure to and\r\nloss from the all-pervading cause.\r\n\r\nThe preponderant evidence given on this subject by the great majority of\r\nthe medical officers in England who are accustomed to visit the\r\nlabouring classes in their own dwellings, is however of the tenor of the\r\nfollowing from the medical officer of the Whitechapel union acting in\r\nSpitalfields parish.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Byles_, the medical officer of the Whitechapel union:—\r\n\r\n  “What is the number of cases you have had to visit during the year\r\n  1841 as a medical officer?—I think the number of cases I have had to\r\n  visit during each year since the commencement of the Union has been\r\n  upwards of 2,000 cases of various disease, of which 1,400 were cases\r\n  out of the workhouse.\r\n\r\n  “Has the present winter been unhealthy?—I do not think it has; there\r\n  has been an increase of fever cases during the last month. The number\r\n  of cases is, however, still below the average of 1838.\r\n\r\n  “Is there not, however, unusual distress in your district,\r\n  comprehending Spitalfields and a portion of Whitechapel?—Yes, there\r\n  is: I believe that more than half the looms are out of work.\r\n\r\n  “Do you not find that fever attacks in greatest number those who are\r\n  out of work?—On the contrary, the greatest number of the cases of\r\n  fever we have are those who fall ill during the time they are in\r\n  employment. I think they are more attacked when in work, when the\r\n  windows are closed, and there is no ventilation. Many of them are\r\n  obliged to work with closed windows, to keep out the moist air, and\r\n  prevent the dust blowing upon their work. When they are out of work,\r\n  they are more out of doors looking after work, more in the open air,\r\n  and that very exercise may be the means of keeping them in health.\r\n  This observation applies to the weavers. I find that they have\r\n  generally less fever when they are out of work. The reverse, I think,\r\n  holds as respects out-door labourers, such as those who work at the\r\n  docks. When they are out of work, they stand about waiting in the\r\n  cold, and when cold, they generally take cheap gin, and no food: they\r\n  catch cold, and on going to their close filthy habitations, their cold\r\n  is apt to generate fever.\r\n\r\n  “There was an unusual amount of fever prevalent in Spitalfields and\r\n  Whitechapel, was there not, in the year 1838?—Yes, there was; in the\r\n  proportion, perhaps, of more than two to one of the present amount. My\r\n  last account for the year ending Lady-day, 1842, was about 250 fever\r\n  cases; it has been as high as 800.\r\n\r\n  “Did it prevail proportionately amongst the weavers?—Yes, I believe it\r\n  did.\r\n\r\n  “Was there any marked or unusual distress at that period?—Not that I\r\n  remember.\r\n\r\n  “Do you find in the course of your experience that the diminution of\r\n  food is followed by fever?—Not as a general cause, I should say. If\r\n  these two persons, casually exposed to the contagion of fever, the one\r\n  in full vigour, and with a full stomach, the other with an empty\r\n  stomach, the person with the empty stomach would be the most obnoxious\r\n  to its influence. In my experience, however, intemperance is a much\r\n  more frequent antecedent to fever than destitution or want of food.\r\n\r\n  “Have you ever observed that habits of intemperance are created by\r\n  distress of mind?—Such cases may occur, but I have not observed them,\r\n  and I think it does not operate as a general cause.\r\n\r\n  “What are the chief remedies which your experience in this district\r\n  would lead you to recommend for the prevention of fever and contagious\r\n  diseases?—The promotion of cleanly habits amongst the poor; the\r\n  promotion of sewerage and drainage; having proper supplies of water\r\n  laid on in the houses; the removal of privies from improper\r\n  situations. I could point out in our neighbourhood many houses, and\r\n  some courts, that ought to be pulled down as wholly unfit for human\r\n  habitation.\r\n\r\n  “What is the personal state of the labouring classes in your\r\n  district?—Generally extremely filthy. I have said that I could almost\r\n  smell from what street a man came who came to my surgery: I do not\r\n  think the poor themselves are conscious of it, but the smell to other\r\n  persons must be extremely offensive. I certainly think that the want\r\n  of personal cleanliness, and of cleanliness in their rooms, and the\r\n  prevalence of fever, stand in the relation of cause and effect.\r\n\r\n  “Your colleague has pointed out that the want of proper and convenient\r\n  supplies of water is an antecedent to the filth and the fever. Does\r\n  your experience enable you to concur with him?—My experience entirely\r\n  agrees with his on that point.”\r\n\r\nThe late _Dr. Cowan_, of Glasgow, and the great majority of the medical\r\nofficers, assign the foremost place to these physical agencies as\r\nantecedents to fever.\r\n\r\nThe medical controversy as to the causes of fever; as to whether it is\r\ncaused by filth and vitiated atmosphere, or whether the state of the\r\natmosphere is a predisposing cause to the reception of the fever, or the\r\nmeans of propagating that disease, which has really some other superior,\r\nindependent, or specific cause, does not appear to be one that for\r\npractical purposes need be considered, except that its effect is\r\nprejudicial in diverting attention from the practical means of\r\nprevention.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Bancroft_, one of the controversialists cited by Dr. Davidson,\r\nobserves,—\r\n\r\n  “That fever often exists in them” (gaols) “cannot be denied; but this\r\n  circumstance can afford no evidence of its being generated therein,\r\n  any more than the multiplication of vermin in such places could\r\n  demonstrate the spontaneous generation of these and other insects by\r\n  the nastiness which favours the deposition and hatching of their\r\n  eggs.”\r\n\r\nTaking the controversy at this point, and admitting the force of this\r\nstatement, the decision upon it will not alter the practical value of\r\ncleanliness, or of its protective effects in prevention, whether it\r\nremove an original or only a predisposing cause.\r\n\r\nYet it cannot but be regretted that the enlightened force of the\r\nprofessional opinion should sustain any diminution from an apparent want\r\nof unanimity on so important a question as the necessity of removing\r\nthese causes, whether original or predisposing: that, for example,\r\nwhilst the fleets were ravaged by fever and disease, men of high\r\nstanding should have occupied the attention of the public with\r\nspeculations on contagion, and infection from the gaols as the original\r\ncause, and diverted attention from the means of prevention, cleansing\r\nand ventilation, the means by which, as will hereafter be shown, the\r\npestilence was ultimately banished. The main error of those who have\r\nascribed fever to destitution, appears to have been in adopting too\r\nhastily as evidence of the fact of destitution, such _primâ facie_\r\nappearances as are noticed by Dr. Scott Alison, an error which\r\nnon-professional experience may correct. In more than one instance\r\nwhere, in a district in which the demand for labour was still great, and\r\nthe wages high, benevolent gentlemen have propounded similar doctrines,\r\nwhich, being at variance with the known state of the labour-market, I\r\nhave requested that the names of these fever cases might be given, that\r\ntheir antecedent circumstances might be examined, and the accuracy of\r\nthe conclusions tested, by officers of experience in such\r\ninvestigations; but I think it right to state the names or means of\r\ninquiry have never been forthcoming. In general, medical practitioners\r\nand benevolent individuals are extremely liable to deceive themselves\r\nand to deceive others, by what they call the evidence of their own eyes.\r\nThe occurrence of severe destitution is denied as a general cause of\r\nfever, not as a consequence. The evidence shows that the best means of\r\npreventing the consequent destitution are those which prevent the\r\nattacks of fever and other epidemics upon all classes of the community.\r\n\r\nBy an extract from a report of the late Dr. Currie, of Liverpool, given\r\nin the Appendix, it will be seen that at the time he wrote, 1797, when\r\nonly 9500 of the population are reported to have lived in cellars, the\r\nproportion of fever cases was nearly the same as at present, when the\r\ncellar population has risen to 40,000; the disease has been almost as\r\nconstant as the surrounding physical circumstances of bad ventilation,\r\nfilth, and damp then pointed out as removable, and the disease has\r\ncontinued in every period of the prosperity of the town in its progress\r\nfrom a population of 77,000 to 223,000 in 1841. So the late Dr. Ferriar,\r\nof Manchester, when writing between 30 and 40 years ago, of the state of\r\nthe population in periods of great prosperity, especially for hand-loom\r\nweaving, described the effect of the bad economy of the habitations much\r\nas they were described in the year 1829 by Dr. Kay, and as they are\r\ndescribed in 1840 by Dr. Baron Howard. _Dr. Ferriar_, when he wrote to\r\nwarn the labouring classes as to the choice of their dwellings, stated\r\nthat—\r\n\r\n  “The custom of inhabiting cellars also tends to promote both the\r\n  origin and preservation of febrile infection. But even in them the\r\n  action of filth and confined air is always apparent when fevers arise.\r\n  I have often observed that the cellar of a fever patient was to be\r\n  known by a shattered pane, patched with paper or stuffed with rags,\r\n  and by every external sign of complete dirtiness.”\r\n\r\nThe false opinions as to destitution being the general cause of fever,\r\nand as to its propagation, have had extensively the disastrous effect of\r\npreventing efforts being made for the removal of the circumstances which\r\nare proved to be followed by a diminution of the pestilence.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of the majority of the medical officers of the unions in\r\nEngland on this topic, acting in districts in every condition, might be\r\nexpressed in the terms used by _Dr. Davidson_:—\r\n\r\n  “It has already been shown that filth and deficient ventilation tend\r\n  much to spread the contagion of typhus, being almost constant\r\n  concomitants; and that while it generally affects the whole members,\r\n  or the large proportion of a family among the lower orders, it rarely\r\n  spreads in this manner among the better classes of society, who attend\r\n  more to cleanliness and ventilation. It is quite obvious that an\r\n  amelioration of the physical condition of the lower orders, in these\r\n  particulars, would, in proportion as this was effected, diminish their\r\n  chances of catching the contagion, which would not only operate in\r\n  lessening directly its diffusion, but by reducing the number of its\r\n  sources, must tend to lessen the actual quantity of this principle\r\n  that might be generated in a given time.\r\n\r\n  “But can this amelioration be effected to any appreciable extent; or,\r\n  if effected, could it be maintained for any length of time? We fear\r\n  that little permanent amelioration could be effected without a\r\n  legislative enactment; for though our philanthropists are very active\r\n  in their charities during the prevalence of an epidemic, it no sooner\r\n  subsides than they relapse into a comparative quiescence, and our\r\n  working population into their former habits of filth and intemperance.\r\n  And the evil will continue to assail us so long as our cities contain\r\n  so many narrow and filthy lanes, so long as the houses situated there\r\n  are little better than dens or hovels, so long as dunghills and other\r\n  nuisances are allowed to accumulate in their vicinity, so long as\r\n  these hovels are crowded with inmates, and so long as there is so much\r\n  poverty and destitution. Why, then, should we not have a legislative\r\n  enactment that would level these hovels to the ground—that would\r\n  regulate the width of every street—that would regulate the ventilation\r\n  of every dwelling-house—that would prevent the lodging-houses of the\r\n  poor from being crowded with human beings, and that would provide for\r\n  their destitution? It may be said that this would interfere too much\r\n  with the liberty of the subject, and no doubt it would be vehemently\r\n  opposed by many interested persons. In place, however, of being an\r\n  infringement on the liberty of the subject, it might rather be\r\n  designated an attempt to prevent the improper liberties of the\r\n  subject; for what right, moral or constitutional, has any man to form\r\n  streets, construct houses, and crowd them with human beings, so as to\r\n  deteriorate health and shorten life, because he finds it profitable to\r\n  do so? As well ought the law to tolerate the sale of unwholesome food\r\n  because it might be profitable to the retailer of it.”\r\n\r\nBut the professional experience and weight of professional testimony on\r\nthis subject is not confined to this country. In a report prepared under\r\nthe superintendence of a commission of the Royal Academy of Medicine at\r\nParis,[16] appointed to investigate the epidemics prevalent in France,\r\nsimilar general conclusions are announced upon similar evidence adduced,\r\nof which we select the following instance:—\r\n\r\n  “If an example,” says the report, “be necessary to justify this\r\n  placing of circumstances as cause and effect, we shall find one in the\r\n  terrible epidemic which desolated the commune of Prades, in the\r\n  department of Ariège, at the end of the year 1838. Out of 750 healthy\r\n  and vigorous inhabitants of this commune 310 were attacked with the\r\n  disease, and 95 died, thus the deaths were 1 in every 3¼ cases. The\r\n  cause of this epidemic, violent and sudden in its nature, and which\r\n  broke out in all points at once, is not less evident. It proceeded\r\n  from a sewer, the receptacle of all the water from the neighbourhood,\r\n  and of the filth which the water brought with it, and of the dead\r\n  animals of the district. The hot, damp weather which preceded it no\r\n  doubt augmented the activity of this focus of infection. The first\r\n  persons attacked were the women employed in washing linen in this\r\n  pestiferous pool, and the labourers working in the neighbourhood of\r\n  it. This terrible epidemic recurred three times, which the invalids in\r\n  their simplicity attributed to the influence of the moon, but which\r\n  mainly depended upon the wind at certain periods passing over the\r\n  infected pool, and bringing the miasma in the direction of their\r\n  dwellings. If for want of sufficient description it is not possible to\r\n  prove completely the similarity of the epidemic at Prades with the\r\n  typhus fever, yet it may be inferred from the symptoms, viz. that when\r\n  the skin was broken deep sores were formed, and that serous abscesses\r\n  showed themselves in the lymphatic ganglions, that this disease was\r\n  very similar to the ancient putrid and malignant fevers formerly\r\n  described by authors, and which are entirely replaced in our\r\n  _nosology_ by the typhoid affection. The physicians of Ariège, in\r\n  order to prove that the disease was not _contagious_, and to re-assure\r\n  the inhabitants, lay in the beds from which the invalids had been\r\n  removed.”\r\n\r\nAdverting to the local reports they have received, the Commissioners\r\nstate—“These reports have awakened in us the sad conviction that many\r\nlocalities are quite devoid of even the most simple ideas on public\r\nhealth; the inhabitants live surrounded by marshes, drains, stagnant\r\npools, manure heaps, without having the slightest idea of the dangers\r\nthey are incurring. Indeed, many of them blindly speculate in these\r\nheaps of infection, increasing the manure which is to enrich their\r\nfields at the expense of their health, and often of their lives.”\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners observe,—“Most of the improvements in public health\r\nhave been brought about through the experience and science united in our\r\nlarge cities; so much so that now epidemics often come to us from the\r\nrural districts. These epidemics are generally much less fatal than\r\nformerly, but are still very prevalent even in the wealthiest and the\r\nmost civilized departments. It would be an important problem to solve,\r\nwhat are the causes which produce these epidemics in the agricultural as\r\nwell as in the manufacturing counties, as in ancient Normandy and\r\nPicardy. One cause is certainly the unhealthiness of the houses. The\r\ninhabitants of these districts are, in general, well fed, well clothed,\r\nbut ill lodged. We are surprised to find in the midst of a fertile plain\r\nwide districts covered with luxuriant vegetation, villages buried in the\r\nground, _smothered_ with large trees, and cottages constructed without\r\nany art or plan, and almost entirely without windows.” The Commissioners\r\nstate, further,—“If you wish to have a robust and healthy people, you\r\nmust have a care for their physical education, their houses, and their\r\nmodes of living. Do not allow generation after generation to be\r\ndepressed under the evil effects of recurring epidemics, which must\r\neventually ruin the strongest constitutions, as is seen to be the case\r\nin marshy and ill-drained districts, where fevers, _goitres_, and\r\nscrofulas constantly prevail.”\r\n\r\nIn another report made on the proceedings of the Conseil de Salubrité,\r\nthe diseases prevalent amongst the population in the towns is adverted\r\nto:—“We must be like the men so well painted by the Psalmist, to reject\r\nsuch evidence—_eyes have they, and see not_. How shall we explain, or\r\nrather to what shall we attribute the difference that is remarked\r\nbetween the mortality of one quarter and that of another quarter of the\r\nsame town; of one street and that of another street of the same quarter\r\nor of the same village; or, lastly, the difference that is observed in\r\nthis respect between the houses of the same street and those houses\r\nwhich are completely isolated? Misery, it is replied to us, is the\r\ncause. Yes, without doubt, misery is a powerful cause; but it is so\r\nespecially when it is driven back into the most insalubrious quarters,\r\nstreets, and houses; when it lives habitually in the midst of filth and\r\ndirt, that is to say, in the midst of an infected atmosphere; and when\r\nthere is no misery, or when it exists in the same degree in the\r\nquarters, in the villages, in the streets, and in the houses with which\r\nthe comparison is made; and, stronger still, when poverty is met with\r\nprecisely there where there is the least mortality; in what is to be\r\nfound the cause of this difference, if it is not in the insalubrity of\r\nthe dwelling-places?”\r\n\r\nThe report on the local epidemics concludes by earnestly recommending to\r\nthe government—“That sanitary measures be adopted by means of which the\r\nconstitution of the people may be renewed, and their longevity\r\nincreased. If this recommendation be fulfilled, we may then hope to see\r\nthe condition of some of the departments ameliorated, in which now the\r\npopulation is so degenerated that the men seem to diminish in size each\r\ntime they are measured for the conscriptions.”\r\n\r\nEvidence on the mismanagement of expenditure in respect to supplies of\r\nfood, on mismanagement also in respect to clothing and fuel by the\r\nlabouring classes, might be added to complete the view of the principal\r\ncauses of disease prevalent amongst them, but these do not come within\r\nthe immediate scope of the present inquiry, which has been directed\r\nchiefly to the investigation of the evils affecting their sanitary\r\ncondition, that come within the recognized provinces of legislation or\r\nlocal administration.\r\n\r\nThe information on the means for the prevention of epidemic disease\r\narising in the common lodging-houses maintained for the accommodation of\r\ntrampers and vagrants, might also have been considered in connexion with\r\nthe subject of the effects of overcrowding and filth which they strongly\r\nexemplify; but it appeared most convenient to consider them apart, from\r\nthe exposition of what may be termed the indigenous evils that afflict\r\nthe settled inhabitants of the labouring class.\r\n\r\nI would now submit for consideration, 1st, the total expense of the\r\npresent state of things, so far as a proximate view of it can be\r\nobtained, on the health, strength, and life of the lower classes of the\r\npopulation. 2d, a proximate view of the pecuniary expense of such\r\npartial remedies as are at present applied or applicable to alleviate\r\nthe consequences of these preventable diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n IV.—COMPARATIVE CHANCES OF LIFE IN DIFFERENT CLASSES OF THE COMMUNITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nVery dangerous errors arise from statistical returns and insurance\r\ntables of the mean chances of life made up from gross returns of the\r\nmortality prevalent amongst large classes, who differ widely in their\r\ncircumstances. Thus we find, on inquiry into the sanitary condition of\r\nthe population of different districts, that the average chances of life\r\nof the people of one class in one street will be 15 years, and of\r\nanother class in a street immediately adjacent, 60 years. In one\r\ndistrict of the same town I find, on the examination of the registries,\r\nthe mortality only 1 out of every 57 of the population; and in another\r\ndistrict 1 out of every 28 dies annually. A return of the average or the\r\nmean of the chances of life, or the proportions of death in either\r\ninstance, would and does lead to very dangerous errors, and amongst\r\nothers to serious misapprehensions as to the condition of the inferior\r\ndistricts, and to false inferences as to the proper rates of insurance.\r\nWith the view of arriving at some estimate of the comparative extent of\r\nthe operation of the chief causes of sickness and mortality proved to be\r\nprevalent, amidst the different classes of society, in the towns where\r\nthe sanitary inquiries have been made; I have obtained the following\r\nreturns from the clerks of the several unions acting as superintendent\r\nregistrars. These returns have, as far as practicable, been corrected by\r\nparticular local inquiry, and are submitted as the best approximations\r\nthat can readily be obtained. In all districts, and especially in the\r\nmanufacturing districts, there is some migration of labourers which\r\nwould, for the obtainment of perfect accuracy as to the chances of life\r\nin particular localities, have rendered necessary an examination of\r\nevery individual case enumerated. This extent of labour has been\r\nconsidered unnecessary. In the returns from single towns, the numbers of\r\ndeaths of persons of the first class are too small not to be affected by\r\naccidental disturbances, but when large numbers of the like class are\r\ntaken, the uniform operation of the like circumstances are shown in the\r\nlike results. It is at present a general defect of the important head of\r\ninformation, “the occupation of the deceased,” that the deaths of\r\nmasters are not carefully distinguished from the deaths of journeymen.\r\nSo far as this error prevails, it will tend to raise the apparent\r\nchances of life amongst the labouring classes. In some instances the\r\noccupations of the deceased, or of the parents of the deceased, in the\r\ncase of children, are not described in the registries. With these and\r\npossibly with other defects that may have escaped notice, these returns\r\nwill be received as corroborative of the reports of the medical officers\r\nand physicians who have attended and observed many of the individual\r\ncases themselves, though not enumerated by them. Had the mortality\r\nprevalent amongst workpeople of particular trades and their families\r\nbeen taken, instead of the mean chances of persons of all occupations\r\nderiving subsistence from weekly wages, the case of classes with still\r\nlower chances would have been presented; but these would have appeared\r\nto suggest particular remedies. Such returns of the effects of common\r\nevils were therefore taken as appeared applicable to the consideration\r\nof common or general means of prevention.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the first returns obtained is from _Dr. Barham_, as to the\r\ndifferent rates of mortality in Truro:—\r\n\r\n  “The information derived from the registers of deaths and sickness has\r\n  been arranged in a series of tables.[17] The first gives a return of\r\n  the condition in life, average ages, and the causes of death, with\r\n  respect to all who died in Truro from July 1st, 1837, to December\r\n  31st, 1840. The occupation of the deceased not being stated in the\r\n  register, except in the case of adult males, the condition of others\r\n  has been inferred in the majority of cases from that of the parent or\r\n  husband, in many from my own knowledge of the parties, and in others\r\n  from the place of abode or other collateral evidence. Altogether I am\r\n  confident that the statement is not materially erroneous.”\r\n\r\nThe sum of these several returns was as follows:—\r\n\r\n No. of                         TRURO.                          Average\r\n Deaths.                                                        Age of\r\n                                                               Deceased.\r\n\r\n      33 Professional persons or gentry, and their families    40 years.\r\n\r\n     138 Persons engaged in trade, or similarly circumstanced,\r\n           and their families                                  33\r\n\r\n     447 Labourers, artisans, and others similarly\r\n           circumstanced, and their families                   28\r\n\r\nIn Derby the proportions appear to be as exhibited in the following\r\ntable:—\r\n\r\n No. of                         DERBY.                          Average\r\n Deaths.                                                        Age of\r\n                                                               Deceased.\r\n\r\n      10 Professional persons or gentry                        49 years.\r\n\r\n     125 Tradesmen                                             38\r\n\r\n     752 Labourers and artisans                                21\r\n\r\nTo compare the chances of life between a crowded manufacturing\r\npopulation and a less crowded rural population, I selected the county of\r\nRutland, because it had been selected as an average agricultural\r\ndistrict for a comparison as to its general condition by the members of\r\nthe Statistical Society of Manchester, and they deputed their agent,\r\n_Mr. J. R. Wood_, to make inquiries on an examination from house to\r\nhouse. The following are portions of his examination:—\r\n\r\n  “Amidst what population have you inquired from house to house?—Amidst\r\n  a portion of the population of Manchester, viz. Pendleton, having a\r\n  population of about 10,000; I visited every house. In like manner I\r\n  went through Branstoun, Engleton, and Hambleton, in Rutlandshire,\r\n  being a rural population of upwards of 1,000, and Hull, having a\r\n  population of nearly 40,000, exclusive of Sculcoates, Ashton, and\r\n  Dukinfield. I also went over for the purpose of checking an inquiry\r\n  into the state of the population of those towns, which had been\r\n  previously made by another party. In Liverpool I did not go from house\r\n  to house; I went into a considerable number of the houses amidst the\r\n  poorer districts. In certain districts of Manchester, though not for\r\n  the Statistical Society, I did the same. In Birmingham I made many\r\n  memoranda, and, as far as my limited time would permit, I visited a\r\n  portion of the population. In York, containing a population of 26,000,\r\n  I went into every street and court, visiting occasionally, to obtain a\r\n  general idea of the condition of the inhabitants. York included 23\r\n  parishes of small extent, all which I visited.\r\n\r\n  “What did you find to be the condition of the tenements in the rural\r\n  districts as compared with the towns you examined?—In Branstoun,\r\n  Egleton, and Hambleton, being in a rural district, the houses are low,\r\n  never exceeding two stories; many of them are thatched, and nearly all\r\n  are built of stone. To each a garden is attached, which is generally\r\n  of sufficient dimensions to supply the family with vegetables. As\r\n  there are no cellars, most of the houses have a small dairy or\r\n  store-room attached, which, however, has not been counted in reckoning\r\n  the number of rooms in each house. Forty-one per cent. of the\r\n  dwellings in Branstoun, and 51 per cent. in Egleton and Hambleton I\r\n  found to be “_well furnished_.” In Manchester and Salford 52 per\r\n  cent., and in the Dukinfield district 61 per cent., had that\r\n  character. The proportion reported to be _comfortable_ in each\r\n  district were:—\r\n\r\n                   “In Branstoun         50 per cent.\r\n                   Egleton and Hambleton 65 per cent.\r\n                   Manchester, &c.       72 per cent.\r\n                   Dukinfield            95 per cent.\r\n\r\n  “The word ‘_comfortable_’ must always be a vague and varying epithet,\r\n  nor is it possible to attach any precise definition to it. In filling\r\n  up this column I was guided by observing the condition of the\r\n  dwelling, apart from any consideration of order, cleanliness, and\r\n  furniture. If I considered it capable of being made comfortable for\r\n  the tenant, I set it down accordingly; if it were damp, the flooring\r\n  bad, and the walls ill-conditioned, I reported it uncomfortable. The\r\n  general appearance of the interior of the houses (in Rutlandshire)\r\n  indicated thrifty poverty, and instances of the squalid misery so\r\n  frequent in large towns were here extremely rare. In comparing the\r\n  physical condition of the people in the three parishes, Egleton and\r\n  Hambleton appeared to have some slight advantage over Branstoun, while\r\n  31 per cent. of the houses in the former parishes contained four rooms\r\n  only; 17 per cent. in the latter had this advantage. In its amount of\r\n  sleeping accommodation, also Branstoun is inferior to the neighbouring\r\n  parishes.\r\n\r\n  “From a comparison of the tables with those in a former Report, it\r\n  appeared that in Egleton, &c., 14 per cent. of the families have more\r\n  than three persons to a bed; Branstoun, 19 ditto; Dukinfield, 33\r\n  ditto; and Bury, 35 ditto.\r\n\r\n  “The rents of the houses in Rutlandshire would appear to be very low\r\n  compared with those in large manufacturing towns. Not only is the\r\n  average cost of the former less than half of the latter, but for that\r\n  diminished cost the dimensions of the houses are double those in large\r\n  towns, with comforts and conveniences which the latter never can\r\n  possess.\r\n\r\n                                               £. _s._ _d._\r\n            “Egleton, &c., average yearly rent 2    17 3\r\n            Branstoun                          3     0 0\r\n            Dukinfield, &c.                    6    14 0\r\n            Manchester, &c.                    7    11 8”\r\n\r\nBut moral causes, inducing habits of sobriety, appear from the report of\r\nthe Manchester Society to contribute to the general result of the\r\nsuperior condition of the Rutland population, in which the duration of\r\nlife amongst the lowest classes appears to be nearly as high as amongst\r\nthe highest classes in Manchester. Wages in Lancashire, it must be\r\npremised, were then (in 1837), and, as I am well informed from the\r\npayers of several thousand labourers, are now at least double what they\r\nare in Rutlandshire. The Society state in their report that it appears—\r\n\r\n  “That the people do nearly as much for themselves in Rutlandshire as\r\n  they do in Manchester, notwithstanding the more extensive endowment of\r\n  their schools.\r\n\r\n  “In a separate examination of three parishes in Rutlandshire, carried\r\n  on from house to house, the larger attendance of children at school in\r\n  that county was confirmed, and it also appeared that the average time\r\n  of their remaining at day schools was greater than in Lancashire. In\r\n  Pendleton, near Manchester, one third only of the children appeared to\r\n  remain at school above five years, and one third remained less than\r\n  three years; while, in the three parishes of Rutlandshire which were\r\n  visited, it was found that, of the children who had left school, one\r\n  half had remained there above five years.\r\n\r\n  “The teachers generally bear irreproachable characters, which has\r\n  doubtless much influence on the character and deportment of the\r\n  population, whose manners appeared exceedingly orderly and respectful.\r\n\r\n  “In the dame schools it was very gratifying to observe the marked\r\n  difference in general appearance and order, as compared with schools\r\n  of a similar class in large towns. The mistresses are almost\r\n  invariably persons of good moral character, of quiet orderly habits,\r\n  cleanly in their habitations, decent in their personal appearance, and\r\n  of respectful deportment. The scholars, too, except in one or two\r\n  instances, were found clean and tidy, however mean their attire, and\r\n  generally remained orderly and quiet during the visit. The rod or cane\r\n  is much less in use than in the towns formerly examined, though it\r\n  usually forms part of the furniture of the school. The girls were\r\n  generally found sewing or knitting, and in many schools the boys learn\r\n  to knit.\r\n\r\n  “A society for the promotion of industry, supported by subscriptions,\r\n  exist in the county; and prizes are given to those children, who,\r\n  according to their age, have performed the most work during the year.\r\n  This excites a great competition as to which village shall produce the\r\n  queen of the knitters, or the queen of the sewers, and many ladies in\r\n  the county consider the Society to have great influence in inducing\r\n  habits of diligence and order. The moral effect is no doubt good, and\r\n  a greater interest in the lower class of schools is also thereby\r\n  created amongst the gentry.\r\n\r\n  “In conclusion, we may observe that the visitation of the houses of\r\n  the labouring poor in Rutlandshire, and the observation of their\r\n  language, manners, and habits, leave a favourable impression with\r\n  regard to their moral condition. Swearing and drunkenness are far from\r\n  common, and the general conduct of the people is marked by sobriety,\r\n  frugality, and industry.”\r\n\r\nMr. Wood was asked—\r\n\r\n  “You have seen the following returns of the average ages of death\r\n  amongst the different classes of people in Manchester and\r\n  Rutlandshire:—\r\n\r\n                                             Average Age of Death.\r\n\r\n                                        In Manchester.  In Rutlandshire.\r\n                                            Years.           Years.\r\n\r\n “Professional persons and gentry, and\r\n   their families                             38               52\r\n\r\n Tradesmen and their families, (in\r\n   Rutlandshire, farmers and graziers\r\n   are included with shopkeepers)             20               41\r\n\r\n Mechanics, labourers, and their\r\n   families                                   17               38\r\n\r\n  Bearing in mind the fact that wages are nearly double in Manchester to\r\n  the average of wages in Rutlandshire, though rents are higher in\r\n  Manchester: are the different chances of life amongst each class of\r\n  the population to the extent they are indicated by the returns,\r\n  conformable to what you would have anticipated from your personal\r\n  examinations of the houses and observation of the condition of the\r\n  inhabitants?—They are decidedly conformable to my anticipation in the\r\n  general results. I apprehend, however, that some allowance must\r\n  perhaps be made for the very high average age in Rutlandshire, from\r\n  the circumstance that many of the children or young people migrate\r\n  from thence to manufacturing neighbourhoods for employment. These\r\n  would certainly have passed the age at which the greatest mortality\r\n  takes place amongst children; but we may expect that their migration,\r\n  as it is a constant migration, might to some extent increase the\r\n  average age of death or apparent duration of life in Rutlandshire,\r\n  though not very materially. On the other hand, there is, perhaps, a\r\n  larger proportion of children in Manchester. The results certainly\r\n  correspond with my own impressions as to the relative condition of the\r\n  different classes in the different neighbourhoods.”\r\n\r\nIn the union comprehending the adjacent manufacturing district of\r\nBolton, the proportions of deaths in the several classes as returned by\r\nthe superintendent-registrar were as follows in the year 1839:—\r\n\r\n No. of                      BOLTON UNION.                      Average\r\n Deaths.                                                        Age of\r\n                                                               Deceased.\r\n\r\n     103 Gentlemen and persons engaged in professions, and\r\n           their families                                      34 years.\r\n\r\n     381 Tradesmen and their families                          23\r\n\r\n   2,232 Mechanics, servants, labourers, and their families    18\r\n\r\nIt is proper to observe, that so far as I was informed upon the evidence\r\nreceived in the Factory Inquiry, and more recently on the cases of\r\nchildren of migrant families, that opinion is erroneous which ascribes\r\ngreater sickness and mortality to the children employed in factories\r\nthan amongst the children who remain in such homes as these towns afford\r\nto the labouring classes. However defective the ventilation of many of\r\nthe factories may yet be, they are all of them drier and more equably\r\nwarm than the residence of the parent; and we had proof that weakly\r\nchildren have been put into the better-managed factories as healthier\r\nplaces for them than their own homes. It is an appalling fact that, of\r\nall who are born of the labouring classes in Manchester, more than 57\r\nper cent. die before they attain five years of age; that is, before they\r\ncan be engaged in factory labour, or in any other labour whatsoever.\r\n\r\nOf 4,629 deaths of persons of the labouring classes who died in the year\r\n1840 in Manchester, the numbers who died were at the several periods as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n              Under 5 years of age  2,649 or 1 in  1‑7/10\r\n              Above 5 and under 10    215 or 1 in 22\r\n              Above 10 and under 15   107 or 1 in 43\r\n              Above 15 and under 20   135 or 1 in 34\r\n\r\nAt seven, eight, or nine years of age the children of the working\r\nclasses begin to enter into employment in the cotton and other\r\nfactories. It appears that, at the period between 5 and 10 years of age\r\nthe proportions of deaths which occur amongst the labouring classes, as\r\nindicated by these returns, are not so great as the proportions of\r\ndeaths which occur amongst the children of the middle classes who are\r\nnot so engaged. Allowing for the circumstance that some of the weakest\r\nof the labourers’ children will have been swept away in the first stage,\r\nthe effect of employment is not shown to be injurious in any increase of\r\nthe proportion who die in the second stage.\r\n\r\nIn a return obtained from a district differently situated (Bethnal\r\nGreen, where the manufactory is chiefly domestic) it appears that of\r\n1,268 deaths amongst the labouring classes in the year 1839, no less\r\nthan 782, or 1 in 1‑4/7, died at their own residences under 5 years of\r\nage. One in 15 of the deaths occurred between 5 and 10, the age when\r\nemployment commences. The proportion of deaths which occurred between 10\r\nand 15, the period at which full employment usually takes place, is 1 in\r\n60 only.\r\n\r\nIn that district the average age of deaths in the year 1839 was as\r\nfollows, in the several classes, from a population of 62,018:—\r\n\r\n No. of                     BETHNAL GREEN.

During the year\r\n1840, the deaths, distinguishable in classes, were as follows:—\r\n\r\n No. of                    LIVERPOOL, 1840.                     Average\r\n Deaths.                                                        Age of\r\n                                                               Deceased.\r\n\r\n     137 Gentry and professional persons, &c.                  35 years.\r\n\r\n   1,738 Tradesmen and their families                          22\r\n\r\n   5,597 Labourers, mechanics, and servants, &c.               15\r\n\r\nOf the deaths which occurred amongst the labouring classes, it appears\r\nthat no less than 62 per cent. of the total number were deaths under\r\nfive years of age. Even amongst those entered as shopkeepers and\r\ntradesmen, no less than 50 per cent. died before they attained that\r\nperiod. The proportion of mortality for Birmingham, where there are many\r\ninsalubrious manufactories, but where the drainage of the town and the\r\ngeneral condition of the inhabitants is comparatively good, was, in\r\n1838, 1 in 40; whilst in Liverpool it was 1 in 31.\r\n\r\nI have appended the copy of a map of Bethnal Green, made with the view\r\nof showing the proportions in which the mortality from epidemic diseases\r\nand diseases affected by localities, fell on different classes of\r\ntenements during the same year. The localities in which the marks of\r\ndeath (×) are most crowded are the poorest and the worst of the\r\ndistrict; where the marks are few and widely spread, the houses and\r\nstreets, and the whole condition of the population, is better. By the\r\ninspection of a map of Leeds, which Mr. Baker has prepared at my\r\nrequest, to show the localities of epidemic diseases, it will be\r\nperceived that they similarly fall on the uncleansed and close streets\r\nand wards occupied by the labouring classes; and that the track of the\r\ncholera is nearly identical with the tract of fever. It will also be\r\nobserved that in the badly cleansed and badly drained wards to the right\r\nof the map, the proportional mortality is nearly double that which\r\nprevails in the better conditioned districts to the left.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the means of judging of the references to the localities in\r\nthe sanitary returns from Aberdeen, the reporters were requested to mark\r\non a map the places where the disease fell, and to distinguish with a\r\ndeeper tint those places on which it fell with the greatest intensity.\r\nThey were also requested to distinguish by different colours the streets\r\ninhabited by the higher, middle, and lower classes of society. They\r\nreturned a map so marked as to disease, but stated that it had been\r\nthought unnecessary to distinguish the streets inhabited by the\r\ndifferent orders of society, as that was done with sufficient accuracy\r\nby the different tints representing the degrees of intensity of the\r\nprevalence of fever.\r\n\r\nIn the Whitechapel union, in which the special investigation which led\r\nto the inquiry into the sanitary condition of the metropolis was first\r\ndirected, the numbers were as follows in the year 1838:—\r\n\r\n No. of                   WHITECHAPEL UNION.

They have accordingly been examined for three\r\ncomplete years, 1838, 1839, and 1840, and it is found that the same\r\ngeneral law of mortality obtains with little variation for each period.\r\n\r\nAs the climate or soil of that county might possess some peculiarities,\r\nI caused an examination to be made of the average periods of death\r\namongst the agricultural population of all the unions in the county of\r\nWilts during 1840. In this examination the registries of deaths in the\r\ntowns were excluded, and only those of persons included who were\r\ndescribed as agricultural labourers, or as farmers and graziers, or as\r\ngentry and professional persons resident in the rural districts.

The\r\nlabouring classes, it is generally known, become old the soonest, and\r\nthe effects of the unfavourable influences in the adolescent and adult\r\nstages is shown in the smaller proportions who attain extreme old age,\r\nand also in the periods of the deaths of heads of families of this\r\nclass, by which widowhood is produced.

In the\r\nfollowing returns made up by _Mr. Farr_, and in others that will\r\nhereafter be cited, the mortality prevalent amongst the females is given\r\nseparately, as probably indicating most correctly the operation of the\r\nnoxious influences connected with the place of residence:—\r\n\r\nMean Annual Mortality of Females in the following Metropolitan districts\r\nin the two Years and a half ending 31st December, 1839:—\r\n\r\n                   Districts.

In the Bethnal Green and the Whitechapel unions, in which\r\nare found some of the worst conditioned masses of population in the\r\nmetropolis, we also find good mansions, well drained and protected,\r\ninhabited by persons in the most favourable circumstances. Immediately\r\nbehind rows of the best-constructed houses in the fashionable districts\r\nof London are some of the worst dwellings, into which the working\r\nclasses are crowded; and these dwellings, by the noxious influences\r\ndescribed, are the foci of disease. These returns are all from large\r\nparishes, containing the mean results from all classes. If it had been\r\npracticable to give correctly the average rate of mortality prevalent in\r\ndifferent classes of streets, the variation of results, it is to be\r\npresumed, from the variations of circumstances, would have been much\r\ngreater. Since the character of the residences of many of the labouring\r\nclasses, and the condition of their places of work and their habits are\r\nknown, it is to be considered that where the occupations are duly\r\nregistered, returns, on the principle of those we have first given of\r\nthe average age of death amongst particular classes will afford the most\r\nclose approximation to accuracy, or the best indications of the extent\r\nof the operation of the noxious circumstances under which each of those\r\nclasses is placed.[19]\r\n\r\n                         A LINEAR REPRESENTATION\r\n  _of the number of Deaths in the Metropolis, from Epidemic, Endemic and\r\n Contagious disease; Diseases of the Brain, Nerves & Senses; diseases of\r\n  Respiratory Organs and diseases of the Heart & Blood Vessels: also the\r\n  number of Deaths from Small Pox, Scarlet Fever, Measles; Typhus Fever,\r\n Hooping Cough, and, all other Epidemic diseases, during each Four Weeks\r\n             of the Two Years, ended the 1st January, 1842._\r\n                    (_Population of 1841.—1,870,727._)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Sanitary Report P.L.C._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe annexed linear view of the numbers of deaths from the chief diseases\r\nduring every month of two years in the metropolis will be of interest as\r\nshowing the influence of the seasons, and especially of the winter, when\r\nthere is the most cold, wet, and crowding.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland we have not the advantage of systematized registries of\r\nmortality or of the causes of mortality, and we are therefore unable to\r\nmake the same comparisons as in England; yet so far as the records of\r\nthe dispensaries serve, they are confirmatory of the returns with\r\nrespect to the different rates of mortality in differently conditioned\r\ndistricts in England. Thus, in a report from Leith, it is stated that—\r\n\r\n  “Contagious febrile diseases of all kinds are met with in Leith,\r\n  particularly typhus, which in certain seasons is prevalent to a great\r\n  extent. The parts of the town in which it seems to prevail chiefly (so\r\n  far as can be deduced from the records of the Leith Dispensary for the\r\n  last five years) are the central and most crowded districts in which\r\n  the number of cases amongst the poor during the last five years have\r\n  been in the proportion of 1 to 6 of the whole population, while in\r\n  other districts not so central in situation, but inhabited by persons\r\n  of nearly the same class, the proportion has been not above 1 to 13\r\n  within these districts. One locality containing a population of 1579,\r\n  has produced 433 cases of contagious fevers in general (of which 306\r\n  were of typhus) in dispensary practice, within five years, being in\r\n  the ratio of 1 to 3⅖ of fevers in general, and 1 to 5⅙ of typhus to\r\n  the gross population; of these 433 cases, 130 of all fevers, and 96 of\r\n  typhus, occurred in the two narrow streets (St. Andrew’s-street and\r\n  Giles’s-street) which bound the district to the north and south, the\r\n  remainder in the narrow lanes and closes communicating with them.\r\n  These may be regarded as the most unhealthy parts of the town.”\r\n\r\nAn impression is often prevalent that a heavy mortality is an\r\nunavoidable condition of all large towns, and of a town population in\r\ngeneral. It has, however, been shown that, groups of cottages on a high\r\nhill, exposed to the most, salubrious breezes when cleanliness is\r\nneglected, are often the nests of fever and disease, as intense as the\r\nmost crowded districts. The mortuary returns of particular districts (in\r\nthe essentials of drainage, cleansing, and ventilation, to which it is\r\npracticable to make other districts approximate, and that too with\r\nreductions of existing charges), prove that a high degree of mortality\r\ndoes not invariably belong to the population of all towns, and probably\r\nnot necessarily to any, even where the population is engaged in\r\nmanufactures. The proportion of deaths appears in some of the suburbs of\r\nthe metropolis (as at Hackney), and of Manchester and Leeds, to be lower\r\nthan amongst the highest classes in two of the agricultural counties.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the report of Dr. d’Espine, one of the members of the\r\nCouncil of Health of Geneva, who has examined the records of the\r\nmortality prevalent amongst the population _extra muros_, as well as\r\nthat in the city (which will hereafter be submitted to special notice),\r\nthat the deaths were in the rural districts 1 in 39·3; whilst in the\r\ncity they were 1 in 44·7 of the whole of the population in the year\r\n1838. In the poorest and worst conditioned of the rural districts the\r\nproportions of the deaths were the greatest. In the year 1837 the deaths\r\nwere in the poorest of the rural districts 1 in 38·6; in the\r\nintermediate district, 1 in 40·8; in the richest district, 1 in 53·2.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with the very high state of the chances of life in the\r\ncounty of Wilts, the city of Bath presents an example confirmatory of\r\nthis view. The _Rev. Whitwell Elwin_ has supplied the following return\r\nof the chances of life amongst the different classes in that city. Out\r\nof 616 cases of death in 1840, the results were as follow:—\r\n\r\n No. of                                                         Average\r\n Deaths.                                                        Age of\r\n                                                               Deceased.\r\n\r\n     146 Gentlemen, professional persons, and their families   55 years.\r\n\r\n     244 Tradesmen and their families                          37\r\n\r\n     896 Mechanics, labourers, and their families              25\r\n\r\nThe very high average chances of life amongst the middle classes, which\r\nis nearly the same as that of the farmers, &c. of the agricultural\r\ndistricts, is the fact adduced as most strongly proving the salubrity of\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\n  “In making these returns,” says Mr. Elwin, “I have thrown out all\r\n  visitors and occasional residents, and my knowledge of the locality,\r\n  with the assistance of the clerk of the union, has enabled me to\r\n  attain complete accuracy with respect to the gentry, and a close\r\n  approximation to it in the remaining cases. The difference in the ages\r\n  of these several classes presents to my mind a tolerably exact scale\r\n  of the difference of their abodes. The large houses, the broad\r\n  streets, looking almost invariably on one side or other upon parks or\r\n  gardens or open country, the spacious squares, the crescents built\r\n  upon the brows of the hills without a single obstruction to the pure\r\n  air of heaven, give the gentry of Bath that superiority over other\r\n  grades and other cities which their longevity indicates. And herein,\r\n  it appears to me, consists the value of the return. It shows that the\r\n  congregation of men is not of necessity unhealthy; nay, that towns,\r\n  possessing as they do superior medical skill and readier access to\r\n  advice, may, under favourable circumstances, have an advantage over\r\n  the country. The situation of the tradesmen of Bath, inferior as it is\r\n  to that of the gentry, is better than that of their own station in\r\n  other places. The streets they chiefly inhabit, though with many\r\n  exceptions, are wide, and swept by free currents of air, with houses\r\n  large and well ventilated. The condition of the poor is worse than\r\n  would be anticipated from the other portions of the town. They are\r\n  chiefly located in low districts at the bottom of the valley, and\r\n  narrow alleys and confined courts are very numerous. Yet even here we\r\n  have an unquestionable advantage over most large towns. It was only\r\n  yesterday that I was expressing my horror to a medical gentleman at\r\n  some portions of the habitations of the poor, when he replied, that it\r\n  excited little attention, because they were so much better than what\r\n  was to be seen in other parts of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n  “Whatever influence occupation and other circumstances may have upon\r\n  mortality, no one can inspect the registers without being struck by\r\n  the deteriorated value of life in inferior localities, even where the\r\n  inhabitants were the same in condition with those who lived longer in\r\n  better situations. The average age of death among the gentlemen was as\r\n  high as 60, till I came, at the conclusion, to a small but damp\r\n  district, in which numerous cases of fever brought down the average to\r\n  54. So again with the shopkeepers, the average was reduced two by the\r\n  returns from streets which, though inhabited by respectable men, were\r\n  narrow in front and shut in at the back. The average among the\r\n  labourers was greatly diminished by the returns from some notorious\r\n  courts, and raised again in a still higher proportion by districts\r\n  which appertained rather to the country than the town. Of three cases\r\n  of centenarians, one of whom had attained the vast age of 106, two\r\n  belonged to this favoured situation. Not but that great ages were to\r\n  be found in the worst parts as in the best, or that particular streets\r\n  did not in a measure run counter to the rule. Still, wherever I\r\n  brought into opposition districts of considerable extent, I found the\r\n  law more or less to obtain. Bath is a favourable town to institute the\r\n  comparison, from presenting such marked contrasts in its houses, and\r\n  the inquiry being little complicated by the presence of noxious\r\n  trades, which in some towns would necessarily disturb every\r\n  calculation of the kind. Even here a colony of shoemakers would bring\r\n  down the average of its healthiest spot to the age of childhood. My\r\n  attention was called to this circumstance by the clerk incidentally\r\n  remarking that more shoemakers were married at his office, and were\r\n  uniformly more dirty and ill-dressed, than any other class of persons.\r\n  The proneness to marriage or concubinage in proportion to the\r\n  degradation of the parties is notorious, and I anticipated from the\r\n  fact an abundant offspring, afterwards to be carried off by premature\r\n  disease. Accordingly I went with this view through several of the\r\n  registers, and the result was, that while the average of death amongst\r\n  the families of labourers and artisans in general was 24 and 25, that\r\n  of shoemakers was only 14. Had the shoemakers been excluded from the\r\n  former average, as for the purpose of this comparison they should have\r\n  been, the disproportion would be some years greater.\r\n\r\n  “The deaths from fever and contagious diseases I found to be almost\r\n  exclusively confined to the worst parts of the town. An epidemic\r\n  small-pox raged at the end of the year 1837, and carried off upwards\r\n  of 300 persons; yet of all this number I do not think there was a\r\n  single gentleman, and not above two or three tradesmen. The residences\r\n  of the labouring classes were pretty equally visited, disease showing\r\n  here and there a predilection for particular spots, and settling with\r\n  full virulence in Avon-street and its offsets. I went through the\r\n  registers from the commencement, and observed that, whatever\r\n  contagious or epidemic diseases prevailed,—fever, small-pox,\r\n  influenza,—this was the scene of its principal ravages; and it is the\r\n  very place of which every person acquainted with Bath would have\r\n  predicted this result. Everything vile and offensive is congregated\r\n  there. All the scum of Bath—its low prostitutes, its thieves, its\r\n  beggars—are piled up in the dens rather than houses of which the\r\n  street consists. Its population is the most disproportioned to the\r\n  accommodation of any I have ever heard; and to aggravate the mischief,\r\n  the refuse is commonly thrown under the staircase; and water more\r\n  scarce than in any quarter of the town. It would hardly be an\r\n  hyperbole to say that there is less water consumed than beer; and\r\n  altogether it would be more difficult to exaggerate the description of\r\n  this dreadful spot than to convey an adequate notion to those who have\r\n  never seen it. A prominent feature in the midst of this mass of\r\n  physical and moral evils is the extraordinary number of illegitimate\r\n  children; the offspring of persons who in all respects live together\r\n  as man and wife. Without the slightest objection to the legal\r\n  obligation, the moral degradation is such that marriage is accounted a\r\n  superfluous ceremony, not worth the payment of the necessary fees; and\r\n  on one occasion, when it was given out that these would be dispensed\r\n  with, upwards of 50 persons from Avon-street, who had lived together\r\n  for years, voluntarily came forward to enter into a union. And thus it\r\n  invariably happens in crowded haunts of sin and filth, where principle\r\n  is obliterated, and where public opinion, which so often operates in\r\n  the place of principle, is never heard; where, to say truth, virtue is\r\n  treated with the scorn which in better society is accorded to vice. I\r\n  have been rendered familiar with these places by holding a curacy in\r\n  the midst of them for upwards of a year, and my duty as chaplain to\r\n  the union, in visiting the friends of paupers or discharged paupers\r\n  themselves, keep up the knowledge I then contracted.\r\n\r\n  “I think these facts supply us with important conclusions. Whether we\r\n  compare one part of Bath with another or Bath with other towns, we\r\n  find health rising in proportion to the improvement of the residences;\r\n  we find morality, in at least a great measure, following the same law,\r\n  and both these inestimable blessings within the reach of the\r\n  legislature to secure. When viewed in this light, these\r\n  investigations, so often distressing and disgusting, acquire dignity\r\n  and importance.”\r\n\r\nThe suffering and expense of life prevalent in differently situated\r\ndistricts observed in this country, are consistent with the experience\r\nof the continent.\r\n\r\nIn a report prepared by M. Villermé, as the reporter of a committee of\r\nthe Royal Academy of Medicine at Paris, appointed to investigate some\r\nstatistical data on the mortality prevalent in that city, and the\r\ndepartment of the Seine, several tables are given to show the\r\nproportions of deaths that occur in each of the several arrondissements.\r\nIn the table on which the most reliance appears to be placed, the\r\nmortality in each arrondissement is exhibited as it occurs in the\r\nprivate residences. In the following table the arrondissements are\r\narranged in the order of the proportions in which the houses are\r\nexempted from taxation, on the ground of the poverty of the inhabitants,\r\nbeginning with the arrondissements where the exemptions are the fewest,\r\nwhere the houses are the largest and most valuable, and proceeding to\r\nthose where the exemptions are most numerous, and the houses the least\r\nin size, as indicated by the value. The average of exempted houses, with\r\nslight exceptions, he considers a fair indication of the average\r\ncondition of each arrondissement as compared with the other\r\narrondissements. In this table I have included a column showing the\r\ndeaths of persons from each arrondissement who die in the public\r\nhospitals and other places appropriated to the care of the sick. These\r\ntables perhaps comprise the whole of the mortality that occurs in that\r\ncapital. I have added the proportions of deaths from cholera in each\r\narrondissement, which followed in the highest and the lowest\r\narrondissements the general law of mortality, with some irregularities\r\nin the intermediate arrondissements which I have not seen accounted\r\nfor:—\r\n\r\n ┌──────────────────┬──────────┬─────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬────────┐\r\n │ ARRONDISSEMENTS. │Proportion│ Annual  │  Deaths in  │  Total of   │Cholera.│\r\n │                  │    of    │ Average │   Private   │Deaths in the│        │\r\n │                  │Tenements │Value of │   Houses.   │House and at │        │\r\n │                  │ exempted │Tenement.│             │     the     │        │\r\n │                  │   from   │         │             │ Hospitals.  │        │\r\n │                  │Taxation. │         │             │             │        │\r\n ├──────────────────┼──────────┼─────────┼──────┬──────┼──────┬──────┼────────┤\r\n │                  │          │         │Period│Period│Period│Period│        │\r\n │                  │          │         │ from │ from │ from │ from │        │\r\n │                  │          │         │ 1817 │ 1822 │ 1817 │ 1822 │        │\r\n │                  │          │         │  to  │  to  │  to  │  to  │        │\r\n │                  │          │         │1821. │1826. │1821. │1826. │        │\r\n ├──────────────────┼──────────┼─────────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼────────┤\r\n │                  │          │   fr.   │ 1 in │ 1 in │ 1 in │ 1 in │  1 in  │\r\n │                  │          │         │      │      │      │      │        │\r\n │ 3.

Similar results were deduced from comparisons of the\r\nmortality prevalent in streets inhabited by different classes; and from\r\ncomparisons of the different rates of mortality prevalent amongst\r\npersons of the same condition as to income, but residing in houses of\r\nfavourable or unfavourable construction and situation.\r\n\r\nIf we could ascertain the rates of mortality formerly prevalent in the\r\nseparate districts of each large town, it is probable we should find\r\nthat the improvement in the average chances of life of the whole town\r\nhas been raised principally by the improved chances in the districts\r\nwhere the streets have been widened, paved, and cleansed, and the houses\r\nenlarged and drained; and that the amount of sickness and chances of\r\nlife in the inferior districts are as little altered as their general\r\nphysical condition. The present condition of those parts of London where\r\nthe average mortality is 1 in 28 annually, appears to be not dissimilar\r\nto the general condition of the whole metropolis about a century ago,\r\nwhich was said to be about 1 in 20, a rate still to be found in some of\r\nthe most neglected streets.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Heberden_, in an able paper which he wrote at the beginning of the\r\npresent century, on the disappearance of several diseases in London,\r\nascribes the fact, and the advance of the public health, to the\r\nimprovements that have gradually taken place in the widening, paving,\r\nand cleansing the streets since the great conflagration. He observes\r\nthat “the annual pestilential fever of Constantinople very much\r\nresembles that of our gaols and crowded hospitals,” and “is only called\r\nplague when attended with buboes and carbuncles.” He ascribes the\r\nexemption to “our change of manners, our love of cleanliness and\r\nventilation, which have produced amongst us, I do not say an\r\nincapability, but a great inaptness any longer to receive it.” The\r\nexamination of the disease prevalent, in the poorer districts, however,\r\nraises the question whether they have not, in the “pestilential fever by\r\nwhich they are ravaged,” any other than a type of the malady from which\r\nit is supposed the country is exempted. The fever itself is almost as\r\nsevere in particular neighbourhoods and in unfavourable states of the\r\nweather, as it is stated to be in the bad quarters of Constantinople.\r\n\r\nThe like improvement in the public health that has followed the slow\r\nstructural improvements in the best districts of the metropolis has been\r\ndisplayed in Paris, where some of the worst districts which remain in a\r\ncondition not dissimilar to that in which the whole of Paris is\r\ndescribed to have been, in closeness and filth, and where the chances of\r\nlife have remained nearly in the same low condition. M. De Villermé, in\r\nproof of an improvement commensurate with the improvements that have\r\nbeen made in the condition of the streets and houses, and the habits of\r\nthe inhabitants, cites a curious document of the date of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, namely, the register of a tax levied upon all assessable\r\npersons of Paris, when Philip-le-Bel knighted his eldest son, who\r\nafterwards succeeded him under the name of Louis the Xth. The persons\r\nassessed were housekeepers, manufacturers, merchants, masters of the\r\ndifferent handicrafts, master jewellers, master masons, master\r\nupholsterers, haberdashers, confectioners, butchers, brewers, wine,\r\ncorn, and cloth merchants, the heads of houses, amongst whom mortality\r\nin the present times would be slight compared with that prevalent\r\namongst the lower classes. From the number of this class who are named\r\nand registered street by street by the parish priests, as having died\r\nbetween the date of the assessment and the date when the tax was levied,\r\nit appears that 232 out of 6042 died in thirteen months and a half,\r\nduring a time which was not remarked for any extraordinary sickness.\r\nFrom hence it is inferred that the general annual mortality in Paris\r\ncould not be less at the commencement of the 14th century than\r\none-twentieth or a twenty-second part of the whole population; whereas\r\nin later times the general mortality has not been known to exceed one\r\nthirty-second part. The general mortality, therefore, or rather the\r\nmortality of a high and select class, was worse in the 14th century than\r\nthe mortality in the worst districts in the 19th, where it was 1 in 24.\r\n\r\n  “But it will be said,” observes M. Villermé, “how can so dreadful a\r\n  mortality be admitted to have taken place in a climate so salubrious\r\n  as that of Paris? I confess that if, in order to justify that\r\n  statement, I had nothing but the book of assessment of the year 1313,\r\n  I should not have allowed myself at this distance of time to have made\r\n  any use of the facts which are found recorded in the book of which I\r\n  am speaking; but the accounts of the time inform us how much public\r\n  _hygiène_ was then neglected, and that in Paris particularly, the\r\n  horrible filth of the streets was insupportable, so much were they\r\n  encumbered with dirt of every kind.\r\n\r\n  “Some idea may be formed of the dirtiness of the streets of Paris,\r\n  towards the end of the fourteenth century, from the words of an\r\n  ordinance of Charles VI. issued in 1388, ‘And whereas the pavements of\r\n  Paris are much injured and fallen into decay, so that in many places\r\n  no horse or carriage can go without very great danger and\r\n  inconvenience, and whereas this town has long been, and still is, full\r\n  of dirt, rubbish, and ordure, which each person has left at his own\r\n  door, so that it is a great horror, and a great displeasure to all\r\n  persons of respectability and honour, and a great scandal and shame to\r\n  this city, and a great grief and prejudice to the human beings\r\n  dwelling in and frequenting the said city, who by the infection of the\r\n  stinking mass of filth have fallen in times past into great illness\r\n  and infirmities of body, and great mortality.’\r\n\r\n  “It must be borne in mind (many other facts prove it),” observes M.\r\n  Villermé, “that the humble citizens of the present day, artisans for\r\n  example, are for the most part much better off, as regards air, and\r\n  those conveniencies which preserve life than persons of much greater\r\n  wealth were in former times in this capital.” From a passage in\r\n  Ulpien, it is estimated that the chances of life is in ancient Rome as\r\n  deduced from the experience of a select class was 30 years.\r\n\r\nHe states, that the first agent to improvement is changing the infected\r\nair that they inspired in Paris for air that is pure. In the recent\r\nprogress of the same change it has been observed there, as in this\r\ncountry, that parts of streets better paved and cleansed are marked by\r\nthe comparative infrequency of disease.\r\n\r\nYet how much remains to be done is shown by the fact that in Paris, with\r\na drier and more salubrious climate, the mortality is still greater than\r\nin London; and that the advantages of which M. Villermé justly speaks so\r\nhighly, are distributed with extreme inequality, is apparent from his\r\ntables, which show that in one district the mortality has diminished to\r\n1 in 52; whilst in another it remains as great as 1 in 26 annually. So\r\nwe have seen that in London it ranges from 1 in 28 to 1 in 57; and it\r\nwill be seen that in the township of Manchester, a population of nearly\r\n80,000, one twenty-eighth are swept away annually, whilst, in a favoured\r\nsuburban district, no more than one sixty-third part die.\r\n\r\nI have been favoured by M. Ducpetiaux, the Inspector-general of prisons\r\nin Belgium, with the copy of a report on an inquiry similar to the\r\npresent, into the condition of the labouring population in Brussels. I\r\nhave submitted an extract from it in the Appendix, descriptive of the\r\ngeneral condition in which their residences were found. When the\r\nproportion which the well-conditioned houses of that city bear to the\r\ngreat mass is considered, it will not excite surprise to those who have\r\ntraversed the poorer districts to find that the average mortality\r\namongst the whole population was, in the year 1840, 1 in 24. In 1829, it\r\nappears to have been 1 in 21.\r\n\r\nIn illustration of the moral and social effects to be anticipated from\r\nmeasures for the removal of the causes of pestilence amongst the\r\nlabouring classes, and for the increase of their duration of life,\r\nconcurrently with an increase of the population, I refer to the effects\r\nexperienced in Geneva from the like improvements effected during the\r\nlapse of centuries. That city is, so far as I am aware, the only one in\r\nEurope in which there is an early and complete set of registers of\r\nmarriages, births, and deaths. These registries were established in the\r\nyear 1549, and are viewed as pre-appointed evidences to civil rights,\r\nand are kept with great care. This registration includes the name of the\r\ndisease which has caused the death, entered by a district physician who\r\nis charged by the State with the inspection of every person who dies\r\nwithin his district. A second table is made up from certificates setting\r\nforth the nature of the disease, with a specification of the symptoms,\r\nand observations required to be made by the private physician who may\r\nhave had the care of the deceased. These registries have been the\r\nsubject of frequent careful examinations. It appears from them that the\r\nprogress of the population _intra muros_ of that city has been as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n        In the Year          Inhabitants.

Edward Mallet_, one of the most able\r\nthat have been made from these registries, that this increase of the\r\npopulation has been followed by an increase in the probable duration of\r\nlife in that city:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                      │                        Proportionate rate of\r\n                      │Years.

In the early\r\nand barbarous periods, the excessive mortality was accompanied by a\r\nprodigious fecundity. In the ten last years of the 17th century, a\r\nmarriage still produced five children and more; the probable duration of\r\nlife attained was not 20 years, and Geneva had scarcely 17,000\r\ninhabitants. Towards the end of the 18th century there was scarcely\r\nthree children to a marriage, and the probabilities of life exceeded 32\r\nyears. At the present time a marriage only produces 2¾ children; the\r\nprobability of life is 45[22] years, and Geneva, which exceeds 27,000 in\r\npopulation, has arrived at a high degree of civilization and of\r\n“_prospérité matérielle_.” In 1836 the population appeared to have\r\nattained its summit; the births barely replaced the deaths.\r\n\r\nM. Mallet observes, that it is difficult, if not impossible, to\r\ndistinguish the different causes, and the different degrees of intensity\r\nof each of the causes that have tended to produce this result. It is,\r\nhowever, attributed generally to the advance in the condition of all\r\nclasses; to the medical science of the public health being better\r\nunderstood and applied; to larger and better and cleaner dwellings; more\r\nabundant and healthy food; the cessation of the great epidemics which,\r\nfrom time to time, decimated the population; the precautions taken\r\nagainst famine; and better regulated public and private life. As an\r\ninstance of the effects of regimen in the preservation of life, he\r\nmentions that, in an establishment for the care of female orphans taken\r\nfrom the poorest classes, out of 86 reared in 24 years, one only had\r\ndied These orphans were taken from the poor. The average mortality on\r\nthe whole population would have been six times as great.[23]\r\n\r\nAn impression of an undefined optimism is frequently entertained by\r\npersons who are aware of the wretched condition of a large portion of\r\nthe labouring population; and this impression is more frequently\r\nentertained than expressed, as the ground of inaction for the relief of\r\nthe prevalent misery from disease, that its ravages form the natural or\r\npositive check, or, as Dr. Short terms it, a “terrible corrective” to\r\nthe pressure of population on the means of subsistence.\r\n\r\nIn the most crowded districts, which have been the subject of the\r\npresent inquiry, the facts do not justify this impression; they show\r\nthat the theory is inapplicable to the present circumstances of the\r\npopulation. How erroneous the inferences are in their unrestrained\r\ngenerality, which assume that the poverty or the privation which is\r\nsometimes the consequence,—is always the cause, of the disease, will\r\nhave been seen from such evidence as that adduced from Glasgow and\r\nSpitalfields, proving that the greater proportion of those attacked by\r\ndisease are in full work at the time; and the evidence from the fever\r\nhospitals, that the greatest proportion of the patients are received in\r\nhigh bodily condition. If wages be taken as the test of the means of\r\nsubsistence, it may be asked how are such facts to be reconciled as\r\nthese, that at a time when wages in Manchester were 10s. per head weekly\r\non all employed in the manufactories, including children or young\r\npersons in the average, so that if three or four members of a family\r\nwere employed, the wages of a family would be 30_s._ or 40_s._ weekly,\r\nthe average chances of life to all of the labouring classes were only 17\r\nyears; whilst in the whole of Rutlandshire, where the wages were\r\ncertainly not one half that amount, we find the mean chances of life to\r\nevery individual of the lowest class were 37 years? Or, to take another\r\ninstance, that whilst in Leeds, where, according to Mr. Baker’s report,\r\nthe wages of the families of the worst-conditioned workers were upwards\r\nof 1_l._ 1_s._ per week, and the chances of life amongst the whole\r\nlabouring population of the borough were only 19 years; whilst in the\r\ncounty of Wilts, where the labourer’s family would not receive much more\r\nthan half that amount of wages in money, and perhaps not two-thirds of\r\nmoney’s worth in money and produce together, we find the average chances\r\nof life to the labouring classes 32 years?\r\n\r\nIf, in the most crowded districts, the inference is found to be\r\nerroneous, that the extent of sickness and mortality is indicative of\r\nthe pressure of population on the means of subsistence, so is the\r\ninference that the ravages act to the extent supposed, as a positive\r\ncheck to the increase of the numbers of the population. In such\r\ndistricts the fact is observable, that where the mortality is the\r\nhighest, the number of births are more than sufficient to replace the\r\ndeaths, however numerous they may be.\r\n\r\nThis fact is shown in the following returns from the eight townships\r\nwhich comprehend Manchester and its suburbs, made by the Statistical\r\nSociety of that town. But I believe the results would be more strongly\r\nmanifest if the registration of the births and of the residences of the\r\nmothers were complete. I have reason to believe that in the lower\r\ndistricts many births, and especially illegitimate births, escape\r\nregistration, and that many take place in hospitals and workhouses out\r\nof the township; whilst in the better conditioned districts the\r\nregistration is comparatively accurate. I have caused attempts to be\r\nmade in several of the worst neighbourhoods in Bath and other places, to\r\nascertain with greater precision the actual number of births; but from\r\nthe migratory character of the population and other circumstances, the\r\nefforts failed to do more than to confirm the impression that many had\r\nhitherto escaped registration.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of mortality in the several townships denotes with little\r\nvariation the state of the streets and houses, and the condition of the\r\ninhabitants. The township of Broughton is inhabited almost exclusively\r\nby the upper classes, who are connected with Manchester. The houses are\r\nnew, spacious, and well built; the site is elevated, and offers great\r\nfacilities for drainage. The township of Cheetham and Crumpsall is also\r\ninhabited for the most part by the upper classes, who live in peculiarly\r\ngood houses, with a superior natural drainage. There is a proportion of\r\nthe working population resident in this district whose houses are well\r\nbuilt, and also favourably situated for drainage. The condition of the\r\nhabitations of a large proportion of the labouring population in\r\nManchester has already been described.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed also that the moral as well as the sanitary\r\ninfluences have a coincidence in the larger proportion of the\r\nillegitimate births in the worst conditioned districts. In the best\r\nconditioned districts the great majority of illegitimate births belong\r\nalmost exclusively to the more dissipated of the labouring classes who\r\ninhabit them.\r\n\r\n ┌───────────┬────────────────┬───────────────┬────────┬───────────┬──────────┐\r\n │Localities.│  Population.   │    Deaths.    │ Total  │Proportion │Proportion│\r\n │           │                │               │ Deaths │ of Births │of Illegi-│\r\n │           │                │               │of Males│    to     │  timate  │\r\n │           │                │               │   &    │Population.│Births to │\r\n │           │                │               │Females.│           │  Total   │\r\n │           │                │               │        │           │ Births.  │\r\n ├───────────┼───────┬────────┼──────┬────────┼────────┼───────────┼──────────┤\r\n │           │Males. │Females.│Males.│Females.│        │           │          │\r\n ├───────────┼───────┼────────┼──────┼────────┼────────┼───────────┼──────────┤\r\n │           │       │        │ 1 in │  1 in  │  1 in  │   1 in    │   1 in   │\r\n │Broughton  │  1,554│   2,239│ 44·40│   89·56│   63·21│      36·82│     51·50│\r\n │Cheetham   │  3,963│   4,862│ 45·03│   63·14│   53·48│      34·74│     50·80│\r\n │  and      │       │        │      │        │        │           │          │\r\n │  Crumpsall│       │        │      │        │        │           │          │\r\n │Pendleton  │  5,109│   5,796│ 40·22│   49·96│   44·87│      25·47│     12·58│\r\n │Chorlton-  │ 12,551│  15,771│ 30·91│   47·79│   38·48│      26·05│     32·93│\r\n │  upon-    │       │        │      │        │        │           │          │\r\n │  Medlock  │       │        │      │        │        │           │          │\r\n │Hulme      │ 12,850│  13,969│ 37·24│   38·48│   37·87│      23·17│     24·10│\r\n │Ardwick    │  4,586│   5,320│ 35·55│   34·54│   35·00│      24·27│     34·00│\r\n │Salford    │ 24,762│  26,760│ 27·30│   36·60│   31·42│      22·83│     21·90│\r\n │Manchester │ 79,061│  84,606│ 26·61│   30·15│   28·33│      26·79│     19·20│\r\n ├───────────┼───────┼────────┼──────┼────────┼────────┼───────────┼──────────┤\r\n │   Total   │141,436│ 159,323│ 28·84│   34·62│   31·60│      25·74│     21·26│\r\n └───────────┴───────┴────────┴──────┴────────┴────────┴───────────┴──────────┘\r\n\r\nIn the ten registration districts of Leeds the mortality prevalent in\r\nthem varies coincidently with their physical condition, and the\r\nrecklessness and immorality as shown in the proportion of illegitimate\r\nbirths, increases in a greater proportion than the mortality; and in\r\nthis instance also, as in most others, if the registration were more\r\naccurate, the proportion of both legitimate and illegitimate births\r\nwould be still closer to the deaths in the worst conditioned districts.\r\n\r\n ┌────────────────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┬────────────┐\r\n │    Registration    │Population.│ Ratio of  │ Ratio of  │  Ratio of  │\r\n │     Districts.     │           │ Deaths to │ Births to │Illegitimate│\r\n │                    │           │ the whole │ the whole │ Births to  │\r\n │                    │           │Population.│Population.│   Total    │\r\n │                    │           │           │           │  Births.   │\r\n ├────────────────────┼───────────┼───────────┼───────────┼────────────┤\r\n │                    │           │   1 in    │   1 in    │    1 in    │\r\n │Chapeltown          │      4,538│       57·7│       30·6│        74·0│\r\n │Whitkirk            │      3,194│       56·0│       29·0│        36·7│\r\n │Kirkstall           │     17,816│       45·6│       24·8│        23·1│\r\n │Rothwell            │      5,557│       45·1│       28·2│        24·6│\r\n │Wortley             │     16,185│       44·4│       24·9│        26·0│\r\n │Holbeck             │     16,668│       41·9│       25·4│        24·3│\r\n │Leeds, West         │     32,286│       40·4│       28·4│        19·2│\r\n │Hunslet             │     15,784│       35·5│       24·2│        21·7│\r\n │Leeds, North        │     30,465│       30·9│       23·9│        14·3│\r\n │East District       │     24,862│       28·8│       24·3│        20·0│\r\n │  (Kirkgate)        │           │           │           │            │\r\n ├────────────────────┼───────────┼───────────┼───────────┼────────────┤\r\n │Total of Leeds      │    167,355│       37·3│       25·5│        20·1│\r\n └────────────────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in the lowest districts of Manchester of 1000 children\r\nborn, more than 570 will have died before they attain the fifth year of\r\ntheir age. In the lowest districts of Leeds the infant mortality is\r\nsimilar. This proportion of mortality M. Mallet designates as the case\r\nof a population but little advanced in civilization, ravaged by\r\nepidemics—a population in which the “influences on the lower ages are\r\nmurderous, but where the great mortality in infancy is compensated by a\r\nhigh degree of fecundity. It is the case of the population in many large\r\ntowns, especially in past ages.” But whilst in Manchester, where one\r\ntwenty-eighth of the whole population is annually swept away, the births\r\nregistered amount to 1 in 26 of the population; in the county of\r\nRutland, where the proportion of deaths is 1 in 52 of the population,\r\nthe proportion of births, as shown by an average of three years, (by a\r\nregistration which I apprehend is more complete than in the lower\r\ndistricts of Manchester,) is only 1 to 33 of the population.\r\n\r\nThe increase of births after a pestilence has been long observed; the\r\ncoincidence of an increase of births in a proportion to the high rate of\r\nmortality in the worst districts has frequently been noted on the\r\ncontinent. M. Quetelet has observed the fact in several countries and\r\ngives instances from which the following are selected:—\r\n\r\n ┌─────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n │     Countries.      │                  Inhabitant.                  │\r\n ├─────────────────────┼──────────────┬─────────────────┬──────────────┤\r\n │                     │For one Death.│For one Marriage.│For one Birth.│\r\n ├─────────────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────────┼──────────────┤\r\n │Department of Orne   │          52·4│            147·5│          44·8│\r\n │Department of        │          30·4│            113·9│          26·0│\r\n │  Finisterre         │              │                 │              │\r\n │Namur                │          51·8│            141·0│          30·1│\r\n │Province of Zealand  │          28·5│            113·2│          21·9│\r\n └─────────────────────┴──────────────┴─────────────────┴──────────────┘\r\n\r\nHe states that he had often been tempted to attribute these\r\ndiscrepancies to a faulty census of the population; but more attentive\r\nresearches had induced him to believe that this state of things is\r\ndependent on local causes.\r\n\r\nM. Bossi, in the Statisque du Department le l’Ain, gives a striking\r\nexample of the effect of the locality. With a view to study the\r\ninfluences of locality, he divided the department into four portions;\r\nand from documents collected during the years 1812, 1813, and 1814, he\r\nobtained the following results:—\r\n\r\n                                               Inhabitants.\r\n\r\n                                  ———————————— ———————————— ————————————\r\n\r\n                                   To 1 Death      To 1      To 1 Birth\r\n                                   annually.

Quetelet’s returns show that so far as the present state of\r\ninformation can be relied upon, the same law is observed in general\r\naction, not only in provinces but in whole countries throughout Europe.\r\nIt is confirmed by extensive experience occurring in the new world. The\r\ntrustworthiness of the registration of births and deaths in Mexico are\r\nattested by the examination and use of them by Humboldt, and have been\r\nthe subject of legislative proceedings. The ratios of births and deaths\r\nin the province of Guanaxuato have been referred to by Sir F.\r\nd’Ivernois, in illustration of the position that pestilence does not\r\ncheck the progress of population. A large proportion of the inferior\r\nMexican population are reported to “have converted the gifts of heaven\r\nto the sustenance of disgusting misery.” It is reported of this populace\r\nthat it is “half clothed, idle, stained all over with vices; in a word,\r\nhideous and known under the name of _leperos_, lepers, on account of the\r\nmalady to which their filth and bad diet subjects them. Nothing can\r\nexceed the state of brutality and superstition to which they have been\r\nsubjected.”[24]\r\n\r\nThe fecundity of this population, sunk in the lowest vice and misery\r\namidst the means of the highest abundance, was greater than amidst any\r\nother whole population in Christendom;[25] they stood thus in 1825 and\r\n1826:—\r\n\r\n                                     1 in\r\n                              Deaths 19·70\r\n                              Births 16·08\r\n\r\nThey are much mistaken who imagine that a similarly conditioned\r\npopulation is not to be found in this country; it is found in parts of\r\nthe population of every large town; the description of the Mexican\r\npopulace will recall features characteristic of the wretched population\r\nin the worst parts of Glasgow, Edinburgh, London, and Bath, and the\r\nlodging-houses throughout the country.\r\n\r\nSeeing that the banana (with the plantain or maize) is the chief food of\r\nthe inferior Mexican populace, their degraded condition has been\r\nascribed to the fertility of that plant, as the degradation of a large\r\nproportion of our population has been ascribed to the use of the\r\npotatoe, whereas a closer examination would have shown the fact of large\r\nclasses living industriously and virtuously chiefly on simple food, and\r\npreferring saving money to better living; and that, if a high and\r\nvarious meat diet were the cause of health, industry, and morality,\r\nthose virtues should stand highest amongst the population of the\r\nlodging-houses, for more meat and varied food is consumed in those\r\nabodes of pestilence than amongst the industrious population of the\r\nvillage. In Manchester, where we have seen that the chances of life are\r\nonly 17 years, the proportions and varieties of meat consumed by the\r\nlabouring classes, are as their greater amount of wages compared with\r\nthe meat consumed by the labouring classes in Rutlandshire, whose mean\r\nchances of life are 38 years.[26] But I apprehend that the superior\r\nhealth in Rutlandshire is as little ascribable to their simpler food as\r\nthe greater amount of disease amidst the town population is ascribable\r\nto the greater proportion of meat which is there consumed. It is\r\nprobable indeed that the standard of vitality in Rutlandshire might be\r\nraised still higher by improvements in the quality of their food. There\r\nare abundant reasons to render it desirable that the food of the\r\npopulation should be varied, but it is shown that banishing the potatoe\r\nor discouraging its use, or introducing any other food, will not banish\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nBy means of the last census and the last year’s completed registration\r\nof deaths and births in England, I am enabled to show that there has\r\nbeen an increase of the population from births alone in those parts of\r\nthe country where the proportionate mortality is the greatest.\r\n\r\nTaking the 42 counties as I find them arranged in Mr. Porter’s paper on\r\nthe census; dividing them into three parts, viz., the 14 counties where\r\nthere has been the least proportionate mortality, the 14 counties where\r\nthe proportion of mortality has been the greatest, and the 14 counties\r\nwhere the proportion of mortality has been intermediate, I find the\r\nresults as to the proportionate increase of births to the increase of\r\ndeaths to be as follows:—\r\n\r\n ┌────────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────────┬──────────┬────────┐\r\n │                │  The annual  │                 │Proportion│ Excess │\r\n │                │ average Rate │  Proportion of  │of Births │in every│\r\n │                │of Increase of│Births and Deaths│and Deaths│ 10,000 │\r\n │                │Population has│to Population in │ to every │Persons │\r\n │                │   been per   │ the Year ended  │  10,000  │   of   │\r\n │                │10,000 persons│ June 30, 1840.  │Persons in│ Births │\r\n │                │ between 1831 │                 │   same   │ above  │\r\n │                │  and 1841.   │                 │ period.  │Deaths. │\r\n ├────────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────────┼──────────┼────────┤\r\n │_a._ The 14     │              │                 │          │        │\r\n │  counties where│              │deaths (1 in 54),│deaths 184│        │\r\n │  the mortality │     112      │deaths (1 in 34),│births 297│     113│\r\n │  has been _the │              │                 │          │        │\r\n │  least_        │              │                 │          │        │\r\n │                │              │                 │          │        │\r\n │_b._ The 14     │              │                 │          │        │\r\n │  counties where│     121      │deaths (1 in 48),│deaths 208│      94│\r\n │  it has been   │              │births (1 in 33),│births 302│        │\r\n │  _intermediate_│              │                 │          │        │\r\n │                │              │                 │          │        │\r\n │_c._ The 14     │              │                 │          │        │\r\n │  counties where│     183      │deaths (1 in 39),│deaths 259│      89│\r\n │  it has been   │              │births (1 in 29),│births 348│        │\r\n │  the _greatest_│              │                 │          │        │\r\n └────────────────┴──────────────┴─────────────────┴──────────┴────────┘\r\n\r\nThe following are the proportions of births and deaths to the population\r\nin 1840, and the total rate of increase of population between the years\r\n1831 and 1841:—\r\n\r\n                    Deaths per An.

In the 14 intermediate counties where the\r\ndeaths on every 10,000 persons increase to 208, there the deaths are\r\nagain made up by 302 births, and 94, or close upon 1 per cent., are\r\nagain added to the population. In the 14 counties where the increase of\r\nthe population is the greatest, the deaths in every 10,000 persons are\r\nincreased to 259, but here also we find that the births are again\r\nsufficient to make up for the deaths; they are 348, and increase the\r\npopulation by 89, or less than 1 per cent.\r\n\r\nHence, if the number of births in each 10,000 persons of the 14 counties\r\nwhere the mortality has been the greatest had taken place amongst every\r\n10,000 persons of the counties where the mortality has been the least,\r\nthen the increase of population in these latter by births, instead of\r\nbeing 113, would have been 164.[27]\r\n\r\nI must again observe that the registration of births in the most\r\npopulous town districts, where the mortality is greatest, is the least\r\nperfect. The excess of births over deaths may really be taken to be\r\ngreater than shown in the returns from the districts where the mortality\r\nis the greatest.\r\n\r\nThe estimated increase of population in England in the year 1840, as\r\ncompared with 1839, is 190,460. In the same period it appears that the\r\nbirths exceeded the deaths by 143,178. The difference between these two\r\namounts, or 47,282, may be considered as the extent of emigration to\r\nEngland, together with the cases of births not registered. To whatever\r\nextent emigration takes place from England, there must of course have\r\nbeen a proportionate immigration from other places to make up the\r\nincrease of population beyond the apparent increase from births.\r\n\r\nIt is observed in some of the worst conditioned of the town districts\r\nthat the positive numbers of the natives of the aboriginal stock\r\ncontinually diminishes, and that the vacancy as well as the increase is\r\nmade up by immigration from the healthier district. In a late\r\nenumeration of the settled inhabitants of the labouring classes in the\r\nlower parts of Westminster, it appeared that not more than one-third of\r\nthem were natives of London. If inquiry had been made as to whether\r\ntheir parents were natives, it would probably have been found that still\r\nfewer had inhabited the district for more than one generation.\r\n\r\nSimple enumerations of the numbers of a population are of themselves but\r\nimperfect means for judging of its progression in strength. That is best\r\nshown in the increased proportions of the adults, who are of the age and\r\nstrength and skill for productive industry, in the extended period\r\nduring which each adult labourer occupies his post.\r\n\r\nM. Mallet bears testimony that the experience of Geneva is confirmatory\r\nof the important rule, that the strength of a people does not depend on\r\nthe absolute number of its population, but on the relative number of\r\nthose who are of the age and strength for labour. It is proved that the\r\nreal and productive value of the population has there increased in a\r\nmuch greater proportion than the increase in the absolute number of the\r\npopulation. The absolute number of the population has only doubled, in\r\nthe instance of Geneva, during three centuries; but the value of the\r\npopulation has more than doubled upon the purely numerical increase of\r\nthe population. In other words, a population of 27,000, in which the\r\nprobability of life is 40 years for each individual, is more than twice\r\nas strong for the purposes of production as a population of 27,000 in\r\nwhich the probability or value of life is only 20 years for each\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nThe important general fact of the proportion of adult physical strength\r\nto the increased duration of life, or improved sanitary condition of the\r\nindividuals, is verified by the examinations of the individuals of\r\ndifferent classes. M. Villermé states that, the difference of strength\r\nbetween classes such as those in which we have seen that the value of\r\nlife differs, is well known to the officers engaged in recruiting the\r\narmy, but no one had collected the facts to determine the precise\r\ndifference. The time allowed to M. Villermé only enabled him to do so at\r\nAmiens. The result was, that the men of from 20 to 21 years of age were\r\nfound the more frequently unfit for the trade of arms from their\r\nstature, constitution, and health, as they belonged to the poorer\r\nclasses of the manufacturing labourers. In order to obtain 100 men fit\r\nfor military service, it was necessary to have as many as 343 men of the\r\npoorer classes; whilst 193 conscripts sufficed of the classes in better\r\ncircumstances. Analogous facts were observed in the greater part of the\r\ntowns in France in which he conducted his official investigations.[28]\r\n\r\nIn the evidence of recruiting officers, collected under the Factory\r\nCommission of Inquiry, it was shown that fewer recruits of the proper\r\nstrength and stature for military service are obtainable now than\r\nheretofore from Manchester. I have been informed that of those labourers\r\nnow employed in the most important manufactories, whether natives or\r\nmigrants to that town, the sons who are employed at the same work are\r\ngenerally inferior in stature to their parents. Sir James M’Grigor, the\r\nDirector-general of the Army Medical Board, stated to me the fact, that\r\n“A corps levied from the agricultural districts in Wales, or the\r\nnorthern counties of England, will last longer than one recruited from\r\nthe manufacturing towns from Birmingham, Manchester, or near the\r\nmetropolis.” Indeed, so great and permanent is the deterioration, that\r\nout of 613 men enlisted, almost all of whom came from Birmingham and\r\nfive other neighbouring towns, only 238 were approved for service.\r\n\r\nThe chances of life of the labouring classes of Spitalfields are amongst\r\nthe lowest that I have met with, and there it is observed of weavers,\r\nthough not originally a large race, that they have become still more\r\ndiminutive under the noxious influences to which they are subject. Dr.\r\nMitchell, in his report on the condition of the hand-loom weavers,\r\nadduces evidence on this point. One witness well acquainted with the\r\nclass states, “They are decayed in their bodies; the whole race of them\r\nis rapidly descending to the size of Liliputians. You could not raise a\r\ngrenadier company amongst them all. The old men have better complexions\r\nthan the young.” Another witness who says there were once men as well\r\nmade in the weaver trade as any other, “recollects the Bethnal Green and\r\nSpitalfields regiment of volunteers during the war as good-looking\r\nbodies of men, but doubts if such could be raised now.” Mr. Duce concurs\r\nin the fact of the deterioration of their size and appearance within the\r\nlast 30 years, and attributes it to bad air, bad lodging, bad food,\r\n“which causes the children to grow up an enfeebled and diminutive race\r\nof men.” (_Vide_ Evidence of the Medical Officers of the District,\r\n_ante_.)\r\n\r\nThis depressing effect of adverse sanitary circumstances on the\r\nlabouring strength of the population, and on its duration, is to be\r\nviewed with the greatest concern, as it is a depressing effect on that\r\nwhich most distinguishes the British people, and which it were a truism\r\nto say constitutes the chief strength of the nation—the bodily strength\r\nof the individuals of the labouring class. The greater portion of the\r\nwealth of the nation is derived from the labour obtained by the\r\napplication of this strength, and it is only those who have had\r\npractically the means of comparing it with that of the population of\r\nother countries who are aware how far the labouring population of this\r\ncountry is naturally distinguished above others. There is much practical\r\nevidence to show that this is not a mere illusion of national vanity,\r\nand in proof of this I might adduce the testimony of some of the most\r\neminent employers of large numbers of labourers, whose conclusions are\r\nfounded on experience in directing the work of labourers from the chief\r\ncountries in Europe, _e. g._, Mr. William Lindley, the civil engineer,\r\nengaged in the superintendence of the formation of the new railway\r\nbetween Hamburgh and Berlin, found it expedient to import as the\r\nforemost labourers for the execution of that work a number of the class\r\nof English labourers called navigators. These were recently employed in\r\npile-driving at wages of 5_s._ per diem, or more than double the amount\r\nof wages paid to the German labourers. The German directors were\r\nsurprised, and remonstrated at the enormously high wages paid to the\r\nEnglish labourers; when the engineer directed their attention to the\r\nquantity of work performed within a given time, and showed that the\r\nwages produced more than amongst the native labourers. English labourers\r\nof the same class have been imported to take the foremost labour in the\r\nexecution of the railways in progress from Havre to Paris, their work at\r\nvery high wages being found cheaper than the work even of the Norman\r\nlabourers. Skill and personal strength are combined in an unusually high\r\ndegree in this class of workmen, but the most eminent employers of\r\nlabour agree that it is strength of body, combined with strength of\r\nwill, that gives steadiness and value to the artisan and common English\r\nlabourer.\r\n\r\nNor is such experience confined to one branch of industry. In the\r\nheaviest works of the manufactories on the continent the strength and\r\nenergy of the English artisan puts him in advance of all others.\r\n\r\n_Mr. J. Thomson_, of Clitheroe, in treating of a question affecting the\r\nbranch of industry, cotton-printing, in England, observes:—\r\n\r\n  “This limited production, in proportion to the hands employed,” in\r\n  France, “has a deeper source than in styles which may be varied, and\r\n  simplified, and changed at pleasure. It is to be found in the\r\n  character and habits of the people, which cannot be changed or moulded\r\n  at the will of a task-master; nor can an English day’s work be had in\r\n  France for an English day’s wages. In 1814, I saw France before she\r\n  had time to profit by the industrial skill and improvements of\r\n  England; again in 1817, and in 1824, when I examined with anxious\r\n  care, during a prolonged stay, the grounds of the prevailing\r\n  apprehension, that our manufacturing greatness was declining, and that\r\n  the cheap labour of France would more than compensate her many\r\n  disadvantages. I returned home with the conviction, since, and now\r\n  again confirmed, that the labour of Alsace, the best and cheapest in\r\n  France, is dearer than the labour of Lancashire. I would not aver that\r\n  an English workman would perform twice the work of a workman of the\r\n  same class in France, but of this I feel assured, from frequent\r\n  personal observation of their habits, and from long and confidential\r\n  intercourse with their intelligent and enlightened manufacturers, that\r\n  the advantage is _more than twofold_ on the side of England, and that\r\n  the true result is not to be obtained by comparisons between\r\n  individuals, or even classes of workmen, but in the comparative\r\n  aggregate industry of large establishments, or a whole population.\r\n\r\n  “Of this difference the intelligent witnesses, who gave evidence in\r\n  1835, before the French Commission of Inquiry into their prohibitory\r\n  system, were fully aware, and with some allowances for that natural,\r\n  excusable, and perhaps commendable nationality on such a subject, they\r\n  did justice to the superior persevering energy of the English workman,\r\n  whose enduring, untiring, savage industry, surpasses that of every\r\n  other manufacturing country I have visited, Belgium, Germany, and\r\n  Switzerland not excepted.”\r\n\r\nThe noxious agencies not only impair the strength of the labouring\r\ncommunity, but, as will be further shown, they tend also to shorten the\r\nperiod of its exercise. This effect will be more apparent when\r\nconsidering merely the pecuniary burdens of the excess of orphanage and\r\npremature widowhood, apart from the loss of protection and the misery\r\nwhich it causes. I shall here only observe, as to the depressing effects\r\nassumed from the admitted tendencies of an increase of population, that\r\nthe fact is, that hitherto, in England, wages, or the means of obtaining\r\nthe necessaries of life for the whole mass of the labouring community,\r\nhave advanced, and the comforts within the reach of the labouring\r\nclasses have increased with the late increase of population. This may be\r\nverified by reference to various evidence, and amongst others to that\r\ncontained in Sir F. Eden’s examinations of the wages and modes of\r\nsubsistence of the agricultural labourers in his day, and we have\r\nevidence of this advance even in many of the manufacturing districts now\r\nin a state of severe depression. For example, an eminent manufacturer in\r\nLancashire, stated to me in November ultimo—“That the same yarn which\r\ncost my father 12_d._ per lb. to make in 1792, all by machinery, now\r\ncosts only 2_d._ per lb.; paying _then_ only 4_s._ 4_d._ per hand wages\r\nweekly, _now_ 8_s._ 8_d._ or more; yet those wages amounted _then_ to\r\n5½_d._ per lb., and notwithstanding the higher wages, _now_, to only\r\n1_d._ per lb.”\r\n\r\nThe prices of provisions were, during the first period, as high as now,\r\nand the cost of clothing 30 or 40 per cent. higher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   V.—PECUNIARY BURDENS CREATED BY THE NEGLECT OF SANITARY MEASURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe more closely the subject of the evils affecting the sanitary\r\ncondition of the labouring population is investigated the more widely do\r\ntheir effects appear to be ramified. The pecuniary cost of noxious\r\nagencies is measured by data within the province of the actuary, by the\r\ncharges attendant on the reduced duration of life, and the reduction of\r\nthe periods of working ability or production by sickness; the cost would\r\ninclude also much of the public charge of attendant vice and crime which\r\ncome within the province of the police, as well as the destitution which\r\ncomes within the province of the administrators of relief. Of the\r\npecuniary effects, including the cost of maintenance during the\r\npreventible sickness, any estimate approximating to exactness could only\r\nbe obtained by very great labour, which does not appear to be necessary.\r\n\r\nTo whatever extent the probable duration of the life of the working-man\r\nis diminished by noxious agencies, I repeat a truism in stating that to\r\nsome extent so much productive power is lost; and in the case of\r\ndestitute widowhood and orphanage, burdens are created and cast either\r\non the industrious survivors belonging to the family, or on the\r\ncontributors to the poor’s rates during the whole of the period of the\r\nfailure of such ability. With the view to judge of the extent to which\r\nsuch burdens are at present cast upon the poor’s rates, I have\r\nendeavoured to ascertain the average age at which death befell the heads\r\nof those families of children who with the mothers have been relieved on\r\nthe ground of destitution, in eight of the unions where the average age\r\nof the mortality prevalent amongst the several classes of the community\r\nhas been ascertained.\r\n\r\nThe workmen who belong to sick-clubs and benefit-societies generally fix\r\nthe period of their own superannuation allowances at from 60 to 65 years\r\nof age. I see no reason to doubt that by the removal of noxious agencies\r\nnot essential to their trades; by sanitary measures affecting their\r\ndwellings, combined with improvements in their own habits, the period of\r\nability for productive labour might be extended to the whole of the\r\nlabouring class.\r\n\r\nThe actual duration of the ability for labour will vary with the nature\r\nof the work, though there can be little doubt that the variations under\r\nproper precautions would be much less than those which now take place.\r\nFrom the information received in respect to the employment of tailors in\r\nlarge numbers, it is evident that the average period of the working\r\nability of that class might be extended at least ten years by\r\nimprovements as to the places of work alone. The experience which might\r\nserve to indicate the extent of practicable improvement is at present\r\nnarrow and scattered. The chief English insurance tables, such as the\r\nNorthampton and Carlisle tables, are made up apparently from the\r\nexperience of a population, subject probably to a greater or less extent\r\nto the noxious influences which are shown to be removable. By the\r\nCarlisle table, however, the probability of life to every person who has\r\nattained the age of twenty-one—the age for marriage—would be 40 years,\r\nor 40·75. By the Swedish tables, which are frequently applied to the\r\ninsurance of the labouring classes, it would be 38·0. The observations\r\nthat have been made on the subject, show that marriage improves rather\r\nthan diminishes the probability of life. Where the duration of life is\r\nreduced by the nature of the employment below the usual average, by so\r\nmuch the widowhood may be considered as increased, as also the orphanage\r\nof their children. As labouring men generally marry early in life, their\r\nwives have ceased to bear children before they have reached fifty, so\r\nthat the great mass of orphanage may be assigned to the consequence of\r\npremature death. The following table shows the average ages at which the\r\ndeaths occurred of the fathers of the widows’ orphan children who are in\r\nreceipt of relief in the following unions. The average includes the\r\ncases of all who died at whatever ages, whether above or below sixty:—\r\n\r\n ┌─────────────────────┬────────┬───────┬────────┬───────┬───────┬───────┐\r\n │       Unions.       │ Number │       │ Number │       │       │       │\r\n │                     │   of   │       │   of   │       │       │       │\r\n │                     │Husbands│       │Husbands│       │       │       │\r\n │                     │ dying  │Average│ dying  │Average│       │       │\r\n │                     │ under  │Age at │ above  │Age at │ Total │Average│\r\n │                     │  60.   │Death. │  60.   │Death. │Deaths.│ Age.  │\r\n ├─────────────────────┼────────┼───────┼────────┼───────┼───────┼───────┤\r\n │Manchester           │     718│     42│     432│     69│   1150│     52│\r\n │Whitechapel          │     351│     44│     239│     69│    590│     54│\r\n │Bethnal Green        │     250│     44│     195│     69│    445│     55│\r\n │Strand               │     157│     42│      63│     66│    220│     49│\r\n │Oakham & Uppingham   │     136│     45│     118│     71│    257│     57│\r\n │Alston-with-Garrigill│      69│     45│      20│     66│     89│     50│\r\n │Bath                 │      66│     38│       1│     60│     67│     39│\r\n └─────────────────────┴────────┴───────┴────────┴───────┴───────┴───────┘\r\n\r\nThis premature widowhood and orphanage is the source of the most painful\r\ndescriptions of pauperism—the most difficult to deal with; it is the\r\nsource of a constant influx of the independent into the pauperised and\r\npermanently dependent classes. The widow, where there are children,\r\ngenerally remains a permanent charge; re-marriages amongst those who\r\nhave children are very rare; in some unions they do not exceed one case\r\nin twenty or thirty. By the time the children are fit for labour and\r\ncease to require the parents’ attention, the mothers frequently become\r\nunfit for earning their own livelihood, or habituated to dependence, and\r\nwithout care to emerge from it. Even where the children are by good\r\ntraining and education fitted for productive industry, when they marry,\r\nthe early familiarity with the parochial relief makes them improvident,\r\nand they fall back upon the poor’s rates on the lying-in of their wives,\r\non their sickness, and for aid on every emergency. In every district the\r\npoor’s rolls form the pedigrees of generations of families thus\r\npauperized. The total number of orphan children on account of whose\r\ndestitution relief was given from the poor’s rates in the year ended\r\nLady-day, 1840, was 112,000.\r\n\r\nThe numbers of widows chargeable to the poor’s rates was in those unions\r\nat that period 43,000. The following abstract of the returns from the\r\neight unions selected exhibit the proportions who become chargeable at\r\ndifferent periods of the head of the family.\r\n\r\n        _Premature

Of the 31 deaths of miners below 60 years of age, from diseases of\r\nthe respiratory organs, enumerated in the above return, a part of the\r\ncauses may be attributable to their occupation, a part to the external\r\ncircumstances of residence and connected habits. Now we have examples of\r\nthe separate advantages attendant on the removal of both causes of\r\ndisease I adduce the following information, obtained through Sir John\r\nWalsham, with relation to the effects of an improvement in the external\r\ncircumstances of the workmen as to residences.\r\n\r\n_Captain Harland_, the chairman of the Reeth union, York (North Riding),\r\nin a communication to Sir John Walsham, states, that he has been anxious\r\nto ascertain as correctly as possible, first, the average duration of\r\nlife among the mining population of the respective parishes in that\r\ndistrict, and how far it appeared to be affected by their general habits\r\nas well as by the state of their domiciles; and he gives the following\r\nresults:—\r\n\r\n  “By a careful examination of the parish registers, I find that in the\r\n  last seven years there have died in—\r\n\r\n The parish of Marrick           15 miners; average age, 47⅗ years.\r\n\r\n The parish of Arkendale         70 miners; average age, 45‑19/35 years.\r\n\r\n The chapelry of Muker, in the   39 miners; average age, 45‑29/39 years.\r\n   parish of Grinton\r\n\r\n The remainder of the parish of  40 miners; average age, 54‑39/40 years.\r\n   Grinton, _viz._ Grinton Reeth\r\n   and Meblecks\r\n\r\n              Total, 164; general average, 48‑13/164 years.\r\n\r\n  “The prevailing diseases throughout the whole district are bronchial\r\n  affections and rheumatism, which may generally be attributed to\r\n  exposure to cold and rain after leaving the close, warm atmosphere of\r\n  the mine.\r\n\r\n  “The miners’ dwellings in Marrick are small thatched cottages,\r\n  situated very near their work; they are consequently less exposed to\r\n  wet and cold on their way home, but (although dry and kept tolerably\r\n  clean) from the want of room and proper ventilation, the inmates are\r\n  more liable to contagious disorders than the more comfortably lodged\r\n  miners in the parish of Grinton. In Arkendale the houses are of a\r\n  somewhat better description, but the drainage is imperfect; the habits\r\n  of the people filthy and intemperate; cutaneous disorders very common;\r\n  and they are frequently the victims of typhus and other malignant\r\n  fevers.\r\n\r\n  “In the parish of Grinton the houses are of a decidedly superior\r\n  description. Forty years ago they were mostly thatched with ling or\r\n  heath; a thatched house is now rarely seen. The miners are all\r\n  comfortably lodged, generally well clothed, clean, and orderly in\r\n  their habits; and I have no doubt to these causes may be attributed\r\n  the great difference between the mortality in this parish and that of\r\n  Arkendale in the same period.\r\n\r\n  “In Muker the mortality, in proportion to its population, has been\r\n  nearly the same as in Arkendale; but many of the miners work\r\n  occasionally in coal-mines, are more exposed to storms, by reason of\r\n  their work being at a greater distance from their dwellings; and those\r\n  dwellings are also of a description inferior to those of the other\r\n  townships in the parish of Grinton. From these circumstances I infer\r\n  that the average duration of a lead-miner’s life, and his greater\r\n  freedom from disease, have increased in proportion to the increased\r\n  airiness and increased convenience of his dwelling.”\r\n\r\nI have already referred to the example cited by Dr. Barham of the health\r\nof the miners in one mine, the Dolcoath mine, in the parish of Camborne,\r\nin Cornwall, where great attention is paid to obviate agencies injurious\r\nto the miners. Care is there taken in respect to ventilation in the\r\nmines. “The ventilation in Dolcoath is particularly good, and the men\r\nare healthier than in most other mines; there are more old miners.” Care\r\nis taken for the prevention of accidents. “Our ladders,” says one of the\r\nwitnesses examined by Dr. Barham, “are about two fathoms and a half in\r\nlength, generally with staves one foot apart. We use oak staves; old\r\nship oak we find the best. We formerly used the hafts of the picks and\r\nother tools, but found these unsafe, the wood being sleepy and flawed,\r\nand sometimes breaking off in a moment, without having shown any outward\r\nsign of unsoundness. Iron staves, besides being at times very slippery,\r\nare apt to be corroded, so as to cut the hand. We have had no accidents\r\non our footways for a long time.” They have introduced the safety fuse,\r\nand the witness says:—“Very few accidents now arise from explosions;”\r\n“they used to happen frequently formerly.” Care is taken of the miners\r\non quitting the mines; hence, instead of issuing on the bleak hill side,\r\nand receiving beer in a shed, to prevent chill and exhaustion, they\r\nissue from their underground labour into a warm room, where well-dried\r\nclothes are ready for them, and warm water, and even baths are supplied\r\nfrom the steam furnace, and, in the instance of this mine, a provision\r\nof hot beef-soup instead of beer is ready for them in another room. The\r\nhonour of having made this change is stated to be due to the Right Hon.\r\nLady Basset, on the suggestion of Dr. Carlyon. “Hence in this mine,”\r\nsays Dr. Barham, “we may fairly attribute to the combination of\r\nbeneficial arrangements just noticed that in Dolcoath, where 451\r\nindividuals are employed underground, only two have died within the last\r\nthree years of miners’ consumption, a statement which could not, I\r\nbelieve, be made with truth nor be nearly approached in respect of an\r\nequal number of miners during the same term in any other Cornish\r\ndistrict.” The sick-club of the mine “is comparatively rich, having a\r\nfund of 1500_l._”\r\n\r\nWhen “care” is mentioned as taken for sanitary measures, it is to be\r\nremembered that it is care only at the outset, and that when in habitual\r\naction the care required is really less, and the measures should be\r\ncharacterized as means for avoiding care and trouble and diminishing\r\npecuniary loss.\r\n\r\nThe effect of sanitary care in the mines of Camborne is, so far as it\r\nhas been carried, marked in the following table, made up by Mr. Blee, a\r\nmedical practitioner in the neighbourhood, from the mortuary registers,\r\nshowing the average age of death of the population as compared with the\r\naverage of death in two other adjacent parishes of Illogan and Gwennap,\r\nin both of which some beneficent alterations have been made, especially\r\nin Illogan, but the works are stated to be new, and the circumstances\r\nnot so favourable as at Camborne:—\r\n\r\n  TABLE showing the average Ages of Persons dying above 30, and\r\n  registered, in three years in the Parish of Camborne, in two years in\r\n  Gwennap, and in one year in Illogan.\r\n\r\n ┌────────┬───────────────┬────────┬───────────────────────────────────┐\r\n │        │    Males.     │Females.│  Proportion per cent. of Miners’  │\r\n │        │               │        │     Deaths by Mine Accidents.     │\r\n ├────────┼───────┬───────┼────────┼───────────────────────────────────┤\r\n │        │Miners.│  Not  │        │                                   │\r\n │        │       │Miners.│        │                                   │\r\n ├────────┼───────┼───────┼────────┼───────────────────────────────────┤\r\n │Gwennap │     45│     60│      64│                                 16│\r\n │Illogan │     49│     68│      64│                                 32│\r\n │Camborne│     54│     60│      63│                                  5│\r\n └────────┴───────┴───────┴────────┴───────────────────────────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe improvement in Camborne had not reached the residences, where the\r\nminers kept pigs, in sties close behind the house, and a dungheap is\r\ncarefully fostered in a catch-pit adjacent. Dr. Barham, and the medical\r\nmen practising in the vicinity, attribute to the decomposition of\r\nvegetable matter in the “soaked soil from the receptacles near the\r\ndwellings a form of fever which has been hanging about Camborne, and has\r\noften passed into the typhoid condition, and has been attended with\r\ngreat prostration of strength.”[30]\r\n\r\nI have obtained through Mr. Baker, of Leeds, who, as superintendent of\r\nfactories, has had good means of making an accurate comparison, the\r\nfollowing contrast of the results as shown in the state of mortality\r\namidst the population of two contiguous manufacturing districts employed\r\nin similar proportions in the same description of work, and differing\r\nonly in the state of the atmosphere in which they lived. The districts\r\nare the townships of Great Bradford and Horton, in Yorkshire, both in\r\nthe parish of Bradford, and contiguous, differing only in elevation and\r\natmospheric influence.\r\n\r\n  “The town of Bradford lies in a hollow formed by the high land of the\r\n  surrounding country, a part of which forms the township of Horton, and\r\n  both populations, in about an equal ratio, are employed in\r\n  worsted-mills, built about the same period of time, in the same kind\r\n  of architecture, with the same appliances for ventilation and\r\n  purification in every respect, differing only in comparison as to\r\n  numbers both of population and mills.\r\n\r\n                        Population.   Births.     Deaths.\r\n            Bradford      34,560     1 in 25·8   1 in 37·3\r\n            Horton        17,618     1 in 28·0   1 in 47·0\r\n\r\n  “The difference between the two localities will at once be seen, and\r\n  can only be accounted for by the difference in atmospheric influences,\r\n  the former population being resident in ill-conditioned dwellings,\r\n  without sufficient ventilation; the latter residing in localities\r\n  which, though undrained in many instances, are yet open to pure air\r\n  and breezes which never reach the town without the most perfect\r\n  contamination.”\r\n\r\nDr. Barham mentions, as an example of the benevolent foresight which\r\neconomizes the strength and life of workmen, and perceives that there is\r\na profit as well as humanity in so doing, that at Tresavean, a great\r\ncopper mine in Gwennap, as a substitute for the ladders, before\r\nuniversal, machinery has been erected for the raising and lowering of\r\nthe miners. This, he states, will be effected at the cost of 2000_l._ at\r\nthe least, but this sum, it is calculated, will soon be repaid by the\r\nsaving of the time and fatigue of the men.\r\n\r\nSuch evidence as that above given, and as will be submitted in other\r\ninstances, will leave little doubt that, by a combination of practicable\r\nsanitary regulations comprehending the economy of the residence as well\r\nas the place of work, the enormous suffering and waste of life which at\r\npresent depresses large masses of the working population may be rendered\r\ncomparatively inconsiderable. The amount of such depression on the\r\nmining population, in making it consist of young persons and more\r\ntransient, is marked in a return prepared by Mr. R. Lanyon, the medical\r\npractitioner acquainted with the locality, and which was read at the\r\nPolytechnic Society in Cornwall.\r\n\r\nOn examining the ages of 2145 _men_ engaged in mining, it was found that\r\ntheir average age was 30 years, and that the average period they had\r\nbeen engaged in work was 15 years. On examining the condition of 1033\r\n_men_, artisans, agricultural labourers, living and working in the\r\nvicinity, it was found that their average age was 40 years, and that\r\ntheir average period of work then completed was 25 years. Of the mining\r\npopulation one-third only had reached 50 years of age, whilst of the\r\nnon-mining population one-third had attained 70 years of age.\r\n\r\nI might submit these two examples, the one as a young and comparatively\r\nweak population, the other as a comparatively mature and strong\r\npopulation. The adult mining population of 30 years of age is not, I\r\napprehend, a population advancing to a further stage of maturity, but\r\none kept down by noxious agencies and premature mortality to that limit\r\nof age, with no chance for them or for other generations to pass beyond\r\nit whilst in this employment, except through the operation of sanitary\r\nmeasures in removing the causes of depression.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the proportions of ages between a depressed and\r\nunhealthy and a comparatively long-lived and strong population, is shown\r\nin the following comparative view of the ages of the miners and of the\r\n1033 non-mining labourers who were living and working:—\r\n\r\n ┌──────────────┬───────┬─────┬──────┬─────┬──────┬─────┬─────┬────────┐\r\n │              │  30   │ 40  │  45  │ 50  │  55  │ 60  │ 70  │80 Years│\r\n │              │ Years │Years│Years │Years│Years │Years│Years│  and   │\r\n │              │of Age │ and │ and  │ and │ and  │ and │ and │upwards.│\r\n │              │  and  │under│under │under│under │under│under│        │\r\n │              │ under │ 45. │ 50.  │ 55. │ 60.  │ 70. │ 80. │        │\r\n │              │  40.  │     │      │     │      │     │     │        │\r\n ├──────────────┼───────┼─────┼──────┼─────┼──────┼─────┼─────┼────────┤\r\n │Miners    1651│    772│  377│   239│  125│    56│   29│    1│        │\r\n │Labourers 1033│    695│  422│ Not  │  284│ Not  │  144│   48│       7│\r\n │              │       │     │given.│     │given.│     │     │        │\r\n │              │  Per  │ Per │ Per  │ Per │ Per  │ Per │ Per │  Per   │\r\n │              │ cent. │cent.│cent. │cent.│cent. │cent.│cent.│ cent.  │\r\n │Miners        │     47│   23│    14│   7½│    3½│   1½│     │        │\r\n │Labourers     │     67│   41│      │   27│      │   14│   4½│       ½│\r\n └──────────────┴───────┴─────┴──────┴─────┴──────┴─────┴─────┴────────┘\r\n\r\nSo that whilst in every 100 men of the younger population of workpeople\r\nthere would not be 2 men of the experience beyond sixty years of age,\r\nnot 8 above fifty, or not a fourth passed forty; in the older population\r\nthere would be 14 beyond sixty, 27 beyond fifty, or a clear majority of\r\nmature age, and, it may be presumed, of the comparatively staid habits\r\ngiven by age. Dr. Scott Allison found that the average age of the living\r\nmale heads of families of the _collier_ population at Tranent whose\r\ncondition he has contrasted with that of the agricultural population,\r\nand whose ages he could ascertain, was 34 years; whilst the average age\r\nof the living male heads of the agricultural families was 51 years and\r\n10 months. He considers that the like proportions would be found to be\r\nmore extensively prevalent, and would serve as fair indications of the\r\nrelative condition of the different populations.\r\n\r\nWhenever the adult population of a physically depressed district, such\r\nas Manchester, is brought out on any public occasion, the preponderance\r\nof youth in the crowd and the small proportion of aged, or even of the\r\nmiddle aged, amongst them is apt to strike those who have seen\r\nassemblages of the working population of other districts more favourably\r\nsituated.\r\n\r\nIn the course of some inquiries under the Constabulary Force Commission\r\nas to the proportions of a paid force that would apparently be requisite\r\nfor the protection of the peace in the manufacturing districts,\r\nreference was made to the meetings held by torchlight in the\r\nneighbourhood of Manchester. It was reported to us, on close observation\r\nby peace-officers, that the bulk of the assemblages consisted of mere\r\nboys, and that there were scarcely any men of mature age to be seen\r\namongst them. Those of mature age and experience, it was stated,\r\ngenerally disapproved of the proceedings of the meetings as injurious to\r\nthe working classes themselves. These older men, we were assured by\r\ntheir employers, were intelligent, and perceived that capital, and large\r\ncapital, was not the means of their depression, but of their steady and\r\nabundant support. They were generally described as being above the\r\ninfluence of the anarchical fallacies which appeared to sway those wild\r\nand really dangerous assemblages. The inquiry which arose upon such\r\nstatements was how it happened that the men of mature age, feeling their\r\nown best interests injured by the proceedings of the younger portion of\r\nthe working classes, how they, the elders, did not exercise a\r\nrestraining influence upon their less experienced fellow-workmen? On\r\ninquiring of the owner of some extensive manufacturing property, on\r\nwhich between 1000 and 2000 persons were maintained at wages yielding\r\n40_s._ per week per family, whether he could rely on the aid of the men\r\nof mature age for the protection of the capital which furnished them the\r\nmeans of subsistence? he stated he could rely on them confidently. But\r\non ascertaining the numbers qualified for service as special constables,\r\nthe gloomy fact became apparent, that the proportion of men of strength\r\nand of mature age for such service were but as a small group against a\r\nlarge crowd, and that for any social influence they were equally weak.\r\nThe disappearance by premature deaths of the heads of families and the\r\nolder workmen at such ages as those recorded in the returns of dependent\r\nwidowhood and orphanage, must to some extent practically involve the\r\nnecessity of supplying the lapse of staid influence amidst a young\r\npopulation by one description or other of precautionary force.\r\n\r\nOn expostulating on other occasions with middle-aged and experienced\r\nworkmen on the folly as well as the injustice of their trade unions, by\r\nwhich the public peace was compromised by the violences of strike after\r\nstrike, without regard to the experiences of the suffering from the\r\ncontinued failures of their exertions for objects the attainment of\r\nwhich would have been most injurious to themselves, the workmen of the\r\nclass remonstrated with, invariably disclaimed connexion with the\r\nproceedings, and showed that they abstained from attendance at the\r\nmeetings. The common expression was, they would not attend to be borne\r\ndown by “mere boys,” who were furious, and knew not what they were\r\nabout. The predominance of a young and violent majority was general.\r\n\r\nIn the metropolis the experience is similar. The mobs against which the\r\npolice have to guard come from the most depressed districts; and the\r\nconstant report of the superintendents is, that scarcely any old men are\r\nto be seen amongst them. In general they appear to consist of persons\r\nbetween 16 to 25 years of age. The mobs from such districts as Bethnal\r\nGreen are proportionately conspicuous for a deficiency of bodily\r\nstrength, without, however, being from that cause proportionately the\r\nless dangerously mischievous. I was informed by peace officers that the\r\ngreat havoc at Bristol was committed by mere boys.\r\n\r\nThe experience of the metropolitan police is also similar as to the\r\ncomparatively small proportion of force available for public service\r\nfrom such depressed districts. It is corroborative also of the evidence\r\nas to the physical deterioration of their population, as well as the\r\ndisproportion in respect to age. Two out of every three of the\r\ncandidates for admission to the police force itself are found defective\r\nin the physical qualifications. It is rare that any one of the\r\ncandidates from Spitalfields, Whitechapel, or the districts where the\r\nmean duration of life is low, is found to possess the requisite physical\r\nqualifications for the force, which is chiefly recruited from the open\r\ndistricts at the outskirts of the town, or from Norfolk and Suffolk, and\r\nother agricultural counties.\r\n\r\nIn general the juvenile delinquents, who come from the inferior\r\ndistricts of the towns, are conspicuously under size. In a recent\r\nexamination of juvenile delinquents at Parkhurst by Mr. Kay\r\nShuttleworth, the great majority were found to be deficient in physical\r\norganization. An impression is often prevalent that the criminal\r\npopulation consists of persons of the greatest physical strength.\r\nInstances of criminals of great strength certainly do occur; but\r\nspeaking from observation of the adult prisoners from the towns and the\r\nconvicts in the hulks, they are in general below the average standard of\r\nheight.\r\n\r\nReverting to the observations as to the influence of adverse physical\r\ncircumstances on the morals of the population, I must here include in\r\nthe observation the younger portion of the population.\r\n\r\nI might adduce the evidence of the teachers of the pauper children at\r\nNorwood to show that a deteriorated physical condition does in fact\r\ngreatly increase the difficulty of moral and intellectual cultivation.\r\nThe intellects of the children of such inferior physical organization\r\nare torpid; it is comparatively difficult to gain their attention or to\r\nsustain it; it requires much labour to irradiate the countenance with\r\nintelligence, and the irradiation is apt to be transient. As a class\r\nthey are comparatively irritable and bad tempered. The most experienced\r\nand zealous teachers are gladdened by the sight of well-grown healthy\r\nchildren, which presents to them better promise that their labours will\r\nbe less difficult and more lasting and successful. On one occasion a\r\ncomparison was made between the progress of two sets of children in\r\nGlasgow, the one set taken from the wynds and placed under the care of\r\none of the most skilful and successful infant schoolmasters, the other a\r\nset of children from a more healthy town district and of a better\r\nphysical condition, placed under the care of a pupil of the master who\r\nhad charge of the children from the wynds. After a trial for a\r\nsufficient time, the more experienced master acknowledged the\r\ncomparative inferiority of his pupils, and his inability to keep them up\r\nto the pace of the better bodily conditioned children.\r\n\r\nThe facts indicated will suffice to show the importance of the moral and\r\npolitical considerations, viz., that the noxious physical agencies\r\ndepress the health and bodily condition of the population, and act as\r\nobstacles to education and to moral culture; that in abridging the\r\nduration of the adult life of the working classes they check the growth\r\nof productive skill, and abridge the amount of social experience and\r\nsteady moral habits in the community: that they substitute for a\r\npopulation that accumulates and preserves instruction and is steadily\r\nprogressive, a population that is young, inexperienced, ignorant,\r\ncredulous, irritable, passionate, and dangerous, having a perpetual\r\ntendency to moral as well as physical deterioration.\r\n\r\nThe group of cases of the mining population from Alston and Garrigill,\r\nit appears to me, will, when considered, afford an example of the\r\npowerful nature of the physical elements of deterioration. In that\r\ndistrict the employers and persons of the higher classes have paid great\r\nattention to maintain the means of moral improvement. They have only not\r\nbeen made aware of the practicability or of the importance of sustaining\r\nthe physical condition of the workpeople, as exemplified in respect to\r\nthe same description of labourers at Camborne.\r\n\r\nThe duration of life amongst the mining population of the lead-miners at\r\nAlston and Garrigill, and the adjacent district, is about 14 years less\r\nthan that given by the Swedish tables. Their physical condition was\r\ndepressed. “The young men appeared very healthy, but exceedingly few of\r\nthem,” says Dr. Mitchell, “were of a large size; and in general it may\r\nbe said they are of a small size.” He states that in moral condition\r\nthey are most exemplary:—\r\n\r\n  “The means of education in Alston parish are extensive: there is the\r\n  grammar-school, the master of which must be acquainted with Latin, but\r\n  he gives a general education; there is a charity-school, and a school\r\n  kept by a master on his own account; there is the school of the London\r\n  Lead Company at Nenthead, at which other children besides those of\r\n  their own workpeople are allowed to attend. There is a school at\r\n  Garrigill Gate, and one at Tynehead, and another at Leadgate; there\r\n  are also many dame schools and 10 Sunday schools. * * * I procured the\r\n  catalogues of several libraries, and the books are such as to convey\r\n  valuable information, and are far superior to most of the works which\r\n  are found in the catalogues of the institutions called literary and\r\n  scientific in and about the metropolis. * * * As to the intellectual\r\n  condition of the people, it is decidedly superior to that of any\r\n  district of England of which I have any knowledge. The witnesses\r\n  uniformly manifested a clearness of comprehension of the inquiries\r\n  made of them, and gave distinct replies, and added of themselves other\r\n  information hearing on the subject. Almost all of them could sign\r\n  their evidence, and most of them wrote exceedingly well. * * * The\r\n  evidence of the employers and the parochial authorities, as well as of\r\n  the men themselves, fully proves that there is a very general\r\n  sobriety, and that the contrary practice is exceedingly rare. * * *\r\n  Offences against property are very rare. It may be doubted whether we\r\n  may consider it a proof of the honesty of the people, that pigs of\r\n  lead may be seen lying by the road sides and in the fells as much\r\n  exposed as so many stones. There is no magistrate nearer to Alston\r\n  than a distance of 14 miles. Offences against the law are very rare.”\r\n\r\nInstances have been frequently presented in the course of this inquiry\r\nof the moral degradation of the children of workpeople, and of the\r\nworkpeople themselves, who have once been what those miners now are in\r\nmoral condition; but the cases taken from the pauper roll of the union\r\nwill serve to show that even a good education will not, of itself,\r\nsustain such a body of workmen against the physical causes of\r\ndepression. The group of cases of widowhood, when considered, will serve\r\nto show that the causes in question create the evils of which they are\r\nsupposed to be natural correctives.\r\n\r\nWith such an educated class of workmen, the obtainment of a place and\r\nthe wages of an adult must be the necessary preliminary to a marriage,\r\nand unless such place or wages were obtained, the young workman would\r\neither remain single or seek employment further a-field. But we will\r\nsuppose, for illustration, that a casualty occurs, such as the last\r\ndeath on the list, J. M., where a young miner who has married and has a\r\nwife and two children is prematurely swept away by an epidemic at 21\r\nyears of age, leaving a widow and two destitute orphan children\r\ndependent on poor relations, or on the ratepayers. The first mentioned,\r\nsay S. H., then takes the vacant place of work, marries, and is killed\r\nat 34 years of age by “an accident in the mine,” leaving a widow and\r\nseven orphan children. This third vacancy in the place of work is\r\noccupied by another miner H. Y., who marries and works until he is 45,\r\nwhen he is killed by “consumption,” leaving a widow and five children.\r\n\r\nSuch casualties do not of course actually so fall on any one place of\r\nwork, but the vacancies so created in different places at the younger\r\nperiods of life must be and are supplied by new hands coming into the\r\nemployment, and marrying as a consequence of that employment, and the\r\nsuccession will fairly represent 1 he mode in which the vacancies\r\ncreated by the various causes of death displayed in the last table and\r\nin the other tables of the causes of premature widowhood and orphanage\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nIn works where the average period of working ability is extended to the\r\nnatural period of superannuation, which the evidence shows that a\r\ncombination of internal and external sanitary measures maybe expected to\r\ngive, namely an average of full 60 years, the account for one place\r\nwould be one superannuated workman and one widow, and a family of four\r\nor five well-grown children, who, having received parental care during\r\nthat period, will probably all have obtained, before its termination,\r\nthe means of independent self-support. Whereas with a population of only\r\n15 or 20 years of working ability, the same place of work may during the\r\nsame period have been filled by two generations and one-fourth of\r\nworkpeople, not one of which has brought all the children dependent on\r\nit to maturity or a condition for self-support; and the account of\r\nwidowhood and orphanage will frequently for the same place of work stand\r\nthus:—\r\n\r\n   Workmen prematurely Dead. Orphan Children. Years’ loss of Support.\r\n        J. M.  1 widow              2                   39\r\n        S. H.  1 widow              7                   26\r\n        H. Y.  1 widow              5                   15\r\n\r\nThat is to say, three widows instead of one, and three sets of stunted\r\nand unhealthy children dependent for such various periods, as those\r\nabove specified, and competing for employment at the same place, instead\r\nof one set of healthy children arrived at the age of working ability for\r\nself-support. The occupation of the places of work by a comparatively\r\nyoung and procreative population, brought forward by the premature\r\nremoval of the middle aged and the aged workers, by the various causes\r\nof premature deaths—the acceleration of births by premature deaths in\r\ninfancy as stated in a preceding note—will, I apprehend, sufficiently\r\nclearly account for the generally increased proportions of births in\r\nthose districts where the rate of mortality is high; and it will\r\nscarcely be necessary to give further illustrations of the dreadful\r\nfallacy which tends to an acquiescence in the continuance of the causes\r\nof pestilence and premature mortality as correctives of the pressure of\r\npopulation.”\r\n\r\nThough the deaths from accidents bear only a small proportion to the\r\ndeaths from disease, yet registries show that the scattered deaths from\r\nvarious descriptions of violence amount to an average of about 12,000\r\nyearly, in England and Wales alone, or more than aroused the national\r\nattention in the late massacre of the troops of the empire during the\r\nwar in India. The position which this class of causes occupy, in the\r\nproduction of destitute orphanage and widowhood, is shown in the\r\nprevious tables; but these do not comprehend the whole of the effects;\r\nanother class of which appear on examining the causes of pauperism:\r\nnamely, the injuries which occasion permanent disablement. In an\r\nanalysis of the causes of pauperism, by _Mr. Simkiss_, the auditor of\r\nthe Wolverhampton union, the cases of which the subjoined is a list were\r\napparent on the pauper-roll.\r\n\r\n ┌──────┬──────────────┬──────────────────┬────────────────────────────┐\r\n │No. of│   Previous   │    Nature of     │      Respective Ages.      │\r\n │Cases.│Occupations of│    Accident.     │                            │\r\n │      │ the Paupers. │                  │                            │\r\n ├──────┼──────────────┼──────────────────┼────────────────────────────┤\r\n │    18│Miners        │Hurt in mines     │21, 23, 27, 30, 34, 34, 40, │\r\n │      │              │                  │  40, 43, 44, 47, 49, 50,   │\r\n │      │              │                  │  50, 51, 53, 60, 60.       │\r\n │     2│Ditto         │Burnt in mines    │40, 60.                     │\r\n │     1│Locksmith     │Lamed by accident │30.                         │\r\n │     1│Wheelwright   │Accident by waggon│69.                         │\r\n │     1│Single woman  │Lost her arm by   │23.                         │\r\n │      │              │  accident.       │                            │\r\n └──────┴──────────────┴──────────────────┴────────────────────────────┘\r\n\r\nOn examining the individual cases of deaths that are classed as incident\r\nto the pursuit of the chief branches of mining or manufacturing\r\nindustry, or in transport whether by land or water, it has always been\r\nsatisfactory to find that for the future, by care, the greater\r\nproportion of them are preventible. In the case of the mining accidents,\r\none part of them appear preventible by care of the superior managers of\r\nthe mines—in arrangements over which the individual workman has no\r\ncontrol; the other portion, by intelligence and care on the part of the\r\nworkmen; and this last class of cases again reverts back to the power,\r\nand therefore to the means of imposing responsibility on the employers\r\nin the selection of educated and intelligent workmen—of habits of\r\nsobriety, and care to qualify them for works of danger. But at present\r\nthey are, in a great measure, relieved from responsibility by the charge\r\nincurred by the want of care being thrown on other funds raised from\r\npersons who have as yet no practicable means of protection or\r\nprevention. When continued and dreadful losses of life take place, in\r\nthe face of examples of successful prevention such as might be collected\r\nfrom every part of the country, it is impossible to avoid the conclusion\r\nthat if the branch of industry were charged with the pecuniary\r\nconsequences of the losses assumed to be necessarily incident to it,\r\ngenerations would not be allowed to pass away in fear, recklessness, and\r\nmisery without the early adoption of those means of prevention which\r\nself-interest would then stimulate. A frequent suggestion made upon the\r\nview of such casualties is that government inspectors should be\r\nappointed to inspect and direct and regulate machinery.\r\n\r\nThis subject was brought under consideration in the course of the\r\nproceedings of the Factory Commission of Inquiry, and it was then agreed\r\nthat such a measure as that of inspection would only give an imperfect\r\nsecurity, and would occasion vexatious interruptions, and that the least\r\nobjectionable mode of interference, as well as the most efficient and\r\njust as a means of prevention, would be to charge a portion at least of\r\nthe cost of such casualties upon the branch of industry. Subsequent\r\nobservation, especially of the causes of pauperism, have strengthened my\r\nconvictions of the soundness of the principle of prevention as stated in\r\nour Report, a passage from which I have submitted in the Appendix.[31]\r\n\r\nIn illustration of the pecuniary cost of disease, as shown in the cost\r\nof remedies in Scotland, there are several documents. The late _Dr.\r\nCowan_, the professor of Forensic medicine at Glasgow, gives one in\r\nwhich he states—\r\n\r\n  “If any arguments were wanting to arouse the community to the\r\n  investigation of this important subject, they might be drawn from the\r\n  heavy pecuniary tax which fever entails on the benevolent of our city,\r\n  from the poverty, misery, and crime which this disease engenders. It\r\n  is not possible, from the data before me, to give anything like an\r\n  accurate calculation of the sums spent for the treatment of fever in\r\n  Glasgow during the last twenty years. The following calculation\r\n  intentionally falls considerably under the amount, to prevent every\r\n  suspicion of exaggeration:—\r\n\r\n                                                         £.    _s._ _d._\r\n\r\n 1. Cost of the fever hospital                           8,566    7    9\r\n\r\n 2. Temporary hospitals, and maintenance of patients     5,000    0    0\r\n      in them\r\n\r\n 3. 21,691 patients at 1_l._ 10_s._ treated at the      32,536   10    0\r\n      expense of the infirmary\r\n\r\n                                                       ———————   ——    —\r\n\r\n                                                       £46,102   17    9\r\n\r\n                                                       =======   ==    =\r\n\r\n  To this amount fall to be added the expense of treating the poor in\r\n  their own houses under the district surgeons of the burgh, and any\r\n  sums expended by the heritors or the gorbals and barony parishes for\r\n  similar purposes. But this sum must have been greatly increased by the\r\n  demands of pauperism produced by fever, on our poor’s-rates, and on\r\n  the private benevolence of our citizens; for the duration of the\r\n  disease, and the period of convalescence which must elapse before an\r\n  individual can resume his work will average rather more than six\r\n  weeks, and when to this is added the difficulty of again finding\r\n  immediate employment, we may safely assume that the 12,895 individuals\r\n  treated in the fever hospitals during the last seven years, all, with\r\n  few exceptions, depending on their daily labour and extending the\r\n  benefit of that labour to others, were out of employment for a period\r\n  of at least six weeks.”\r\n\r\nThe _Rev. G. Lewis_, the minister of St. David’s parish, Dundee, who has\r\nanswered the queries issued by the Board, and very powerfully addressed\r\nthe inhabitants on this subject, in the course of one of his addresses,\r\nobserves that—\r\n\r\n  “Apart altogether from the waste of human life, and the indescribable\r\n  suffering and sorrow which annually fall upon the working classes of\r\n  Dundee from this periodical scourge, and viewed only as a mere matter\r\n  of profit and loss to the mercantile and monied interest of Dundee, it\r\n  were easy to demonstrate, that the expenditure of several thousand\r\n  pounds per annum, in providing the means of cleanliness to this town,\r\n  in the better cleansing of its streets, but, above all, of its back\r\n  closes, courts, and lanes, and the clearing away of those pestilential\r\n  masses of building which lie concealed from view behind the front\r\n  lines of some of our principal streets, would have been rewarded by a\r\n  saving to the community of a vast sum, which the ravages of disease\r\n  and death have been, for the last few years, compelling Dundee to pay\r\n  in a way its inhabitants think not of. That this may appear, I have\r\n  brought into one table the number of cases of fever during the last\r\n  seven years.\r\n\r\n                           “CASES of Fever in\r\n                           Dundee during the\r\n                           last seven years,\r\n                           from 1833 to 1839,\r\n                               inclusive,\r\n                          calculated from the\r\n                           Bills of Mortality\r\n                            according to the\r\n                           proportion of nine\r\n                             cases to each\r\n                                death:—\r\n\r\n                          Year.

Put wholly aside the details of\r\n  domestic woe and personal suffering which 11,808 cases of fever have\r\n  introduced into the families of Dundee in these seven years—omit all\r\n  reckoning of the watching, want, and wretchedness, wrapped up in so\r\n  many cases of acute disease, and the family bereavements implied in\r\n  these 1,312 death—and let us view for a moment our fellow-creatures\r\n  but as so many machines suspended from work by the derangement or\r\n  destruction of the human machinery, that we may learn something of the\r\n  probable money loss incurred by fever in these seven years.\r\n\r\n  “From Dr. Southwood Smith, the highest authority on these subjects, we\r\n  learn that fully one-half of the cases of fever occur in the prime of\r\n  life, when men are most useful either to their families or to society.\r\n  Deducting then the 1,312 deaths from the whole number of cases, there\r\n  will remain 10,496 cases of fever, the one-half of whom, at least,\r\n  were adults,—that is, 5,248 persons in the prime of life, very many of\r\n  them heads of families, had fever in these seven years. Now, the\r\n  average period fever detains a patient from work, according to the\r\n  same authority, is six weeks. Let us take the earnings in health of\r\n  these adults at the average of 8_s._ weekly; and the loss of wages to\r\n  these 5,248 adults, by six weeks’ fever, amounts to 12,595_l._; and\r\n  this, after excluding all under age, and all the deaths. But these\r\n  cases, whether treated at home or at the infirmary, must be also\r\n  loaded with the expense of medical treatment, which is estimated in\r\n  our infirmary reports at 1_l._ to each case, that is, 5,248_l._ must\r\n  he added to the loss by wages. But 5,248 cases of those under age\r\n  remain to be accounted for; and, as fever rarely attacks mere\r\n  children, but chiefly those either in manhood or approaching manhood,\r\n  we may estimate the loss of their labour at the one-half of the\r\n  adults, or 6,297_l._ 12_s._, and the expense of attendance and\r\n  recovery at one-half also, or 2,624_l._\r\n\r\n  “But how shall we estimate the pecuniary loss of 1,312 deaths? It\r\n  seems a strange thing to go about estimating the money value of that\r\n  which money did not give, and cannot restore when taken away; yet as\r\n  there are those who understand better a profit and loss account than\r\n  the arguments of religion and humanity, we shall attempt to estimate\r\n  the money loss of these 1,312 deaths by fever.\r\n\r\n  “At least one-half, or 656 of these deaths, were deaths of adults, and\r\n  very many of them heads of families, of which the 337 widows in St.\r\n  David’s parish afford melancholy evidence.”\r\n\r\nHe then refers to an estimate made by _Mr. M’Culloch_, who, viewing a\r\nhuman being as a productive machine, reared to last a certain time, and\r\nto return so much more than he costs, estimates a full-grown workman\r\njust, arrived at maturity as having 300_l._ of capital invested in him.\r\nAt the actual cost of maintaining and training a pauper child in England\r\nat the school in Norwood, 4_s._ 6_d._ per week, he will have had\r\nexpended upon him at 21 years of age, 245_l._, or at 30 years, 350_l._;\r\nbut he supposes—\r\n\r\n  “The money value of these male and female adults to be just the\r\n  one-half of this, or 150_l._, which makes the loss, by the premature\r\n  death of these 656 adults, to be 98,400_l._; and, if the remaining 656\r\n  under the age of maturity, yet approaching it, be taken at the half of\r\n  the adults, or 75_l._ each, we have a loss of 49,200_l._ more; to\r\n  which, if we add 1_l._ a-piece, or 1,312_l._ in all, for attendance\r\n  and medical expenses, the Fever Bill of Dundee, during the last seven\r\n  years, will stand as follows:—\r\n\r\n                 Fever Bill of Dundee from 1833 to 1839.\r\n\r\n                                                         £.    _s._ _d._\r\n\r\n Loss of labour for six weeks of 5,248 adults  at       12,595    0    0\r\n   8_s._ a-week\r\n\r\n Attendance, medicine at home or infirmary, at 1_l._     5,248    0    0\r\n   each\r\n\r\n Loss of labour for six weeks of 5,248 under age, at     6,297   12    0\r\n   4_s._ a-week\r\n\r\n Expense of treatment of the above at infirmary or       2,624    0    0\r\n   home, at 10_s._ a-piece\r\n\r\n Loss by death of 656 adults, at 150_l._ each.          98,400    0    0\r\n\r\n Loss by 656 deaths under age, at 75_l._ a-piece        49,200    0    0\r\n\r\n Treatment of 1,312 cases, at 1_l._  each                1,312    0    0\r\n\r\n                                                      ————————   ——    —\r\n\r\n                                                      £175,676   12    0\r\n\r\n                     Or 25,096_l._ 13_s._ per annum.\r\n\r\n  “The poor, we are told, we shall always have with us, and so with\r\n  disease and death. Yet the evils, both of poverty and disease, come in\r\n  very different measures to different communities. As there is a\r\n  poverty that is self-inflicted, and may be self-removed, so there is a\r\n  certain amount of disease and annual mortality in every city that is\r\n  self-inflicted; and the community that does not strive, by every\r\n  available means, to reduce its disease and mortality bills to the\r\n  lowest sum of human suffering, and the lowest rate of annual\r\n  mortality, is as guilty of suicide as the individual who, Judas like,\r\n  takes with his own hands the life God has given, and hurries unbidden\r\n  into the presence of his Judge. The fever bills of the Scottish towns,\r\n  contrasted with those of the English commercial towns, declare too\r\n  plainly that man has not yet done his part in Dundee to avert this\r\n  scourge of society; and, while fever is undoubtedly to be regarded as\r\n  the visitation of God, it is also to be regarded as the visitation of\r\n  God for the sin of neglecting a population fallen in character and\r\n  habits.\r\n\r\n  In the following table are given the deaths in Dundee in seven years,\r\n  and the rate to the population,—supposing the inhabitants in 1831 to\r\n  have been 45,355 souls, and to have increased about 2000 annually,\r\n  until 1839, when from bad trade the increase was checked:—\r\n\r\n   Years.

If\r\n  the deaths are a fourth greater, those diseases which are its\r\n  harbingers must be many times greater than the deaths; and to this\r\n  extent, at least, it was in the power of human means to have provided\r\n  a remedy,—to have abated by one-fourth the physical suffering and\r\n  mortality of Dundee, saved 2,952 persons from fever, and 328 persons\r\n  from premature death, and reduced by a fourth part the pecuniary loss\r\n  incurred during the last seven years,—in other words, to have saved\r\n  43,919_l._, or 6,274_l._ annually, to the profit and loss account of\r\n  this city in the single item of fever.\r\n\r\n  “The statistics of small-pox in Dundee might be added to this bill of\r\n  charges. It is sufficient, however, to allude to it. Last year, the\r\n  deaths by small-pox were 77. In 1838, they were also 77; and in 1837,\r\n  they amounted to 126. The number of cases, of course, must have been\r\n  many times the deaths; by far the greater number under age and\r\n  unvaccinated,—a neglect no longer confined to the Irish population.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “Though I am no medical authority, yet I am sure that I have every\r\n  medical authority with me when I connect, as foremost amongst the\r\n  causes of the enormous Fever Bill of Dundee that monstrous Tavern\r\n  Bill, which last lecture I showed you was the worm in the bud of the\r\n  happiness and well-being of its working classes.

In vain we cry out against the taxation of Government. While\r\n  the words of complaint are on our lips, here is a vice of continual\r\n  tasting and tippling in strong drink,—a private self-imposed tax, but\r\n  heavier far than any public tax. It is this besetting sin that has\r\n  been not only devouring the substance of the poor, but every year\r\n  sowing the seeds of that enormous Fever Bill which for the last seven\r\n  years has been taxing us, not only in purse but in person,—compelling\r\n  every tenth man in Dundee during that period to pay the wages of six\r\n  weeks’ labour, and to suffer all the langour, sickness, and oppression\r\n  of six weeks’ fever, besides the bereaved widows and orphans, and the\r\n  fatherless and motherless children it has left in Dundee.”\r\n\r\nI now proceed to submit the reasons for believing that the immediate\r\nexpenditure of so much money as would be incurred by the adoption of\r\nsuch of the remedial measures as appear to be available by the agency of\r\nany public administration would be sound measures of immediate economy,\r\nand of ultimate public gain: and also the grounds for believing that the\r\nsame conclusion is applicable to the cost of those measures of\r\nprevention which, though directly or indirectly controllable by\r\nlegislative authority, are within the province of private individuals to\r\nexecute, such as the construction of the dwellings of the labouring\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   VI.—EVIDENCE OF THE EFFECTS OF PREVENTIVE MEASURES IN RAISING THE\r\n              STANDARD OF HEALTH AND THE CHANCES OF LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn viewing the evidence, which shows that, in most situations higher\r\nchances of life belong to the middle and higher classes of the\r\npopulation, an impression may be created that the higher standards of\r\nhealth are essentially connected with expensive modes of living. The\r\nhighest medical authorities agree, however, that the more important\r\nmeans for the protection and advance of the health of those classes must\r\nbe in still further reductions than those which it is the present\r\ntendency in the higher classes of society to make of the use of highly\r\nstimulating food. The evidence already adduced with respect to the\r\nlabouring classes in the rural districts and those living on high wages\r\nin towns, will have gone some way to remove the erroneous impression\r\nwith respect to them, and it admits of proof that a higher standard of\r\nhealth and comfort is attainable for them even at a less expense than\r\nthat in which they now live in disease and misery. The experience of the\r\neffect of sanitary measures in the royal navy may be adduced as evidence\r\nof the practicable standards of health consistent with great labour and\r\nexposure to weather obtained at a cost not higher than that within the\r\nwages of ordinary labourers. The experience of the effects of sanitary\r\nmeasures in banishing spontaneous disease from crowded prisons, offers\r\nfurther evidence of the health obtainable by simple means, under\r\ncircumstances still more unfavourable.\r\n\r\nThe prisons were formerly distinguished for their filth, and their bad\r\nventilation; but the descriptions given by Howard of the worst prisons\r\nhe visited in England (which he states were amongst the worst he had\r\nseen in Europe) were exceeded in every wynd in Edinburgh and Glasgow,\r\ninspected by Dr. Arnott and myself, in company with the municipal\r\nofficers of those cities. More filth, worse physical suffering and moral\r\ndisorder than Howard describes as affecting the prisoners, are to be\r\nfound amongst the cellar population of the working people of Liverpool,\r\nManchester, or Leeds, and in large portions of the metropolis. As a\r\nstandard of the progress made in ameliorating the condition of\r\nprisoners, I refer to his general statement of the condition in which he\r\nfound the prisons when he inspected them in England.\r\n\r\n  “_Water._—Many prisons have _no water_. This defect is frequent in\r\n  bridewells and town gaols. In the felons’ courts of some county gaols\r\n  there is no water: in some places where there is water, prisoners are\r\n  always locked up within doors, and have no more than the keeper or his\r\n  servants think fit to bring them.\r\n\r\n  “_Air._—And as to air, which is no less necessary than the two\r\n  preceding articles, and given us by Providence quite gratis, without\r\n  any care or labour of our own; yet, as if the bounteous goodness of\r\n  heaven excited our envy, methods are contrived to rob prisoners of\r\n  this genuine cordial of life, as Dr. Hales very properly calls it; I\r\n  mean by preventing that circulation and change of the fluid without\r\n  which animals cannot live and thrive. It is well known that air which\r\n  has performed its office in the lungs is feculent and noxious. Writers\r\n  upon this subject show that a hogshead of air will last a man only an\r\n  hour: but those who do not choose to consult philosophers may judge\r\n  from a notorious fact. In 1756, at Calcutta, in Bengal, out of 170\r\n  persons who were confined in a hole there one night, 154 were taken\r\n  out dead. The few survivors ascribed the mortality to their want of\r\n  fresh air; and called the place, Hell in Miniature.\r\n\r\n  “From hence any one may judge of the probability there is against\r\n  health and life of prisoners crowded in their rooms, cells, and\r\n  subterraneous dungeons, for 14 or 15 hours out of the 24. In some of\r\n  those caverns the floor is very damp; in some there is sometimes an\r\n  inch or two of water; and the straw or bedding is laid on such floors,\r\n  seldom on barrack bedsteads. Where prisoners are not kept in\r\n  underground cells, they are often confined in their rooms, because\r\n  there is no court belonging to the prisons; which is the case in many\r\n  city and town gaols; because the walls round the yard are ruinous, or\r\n  are too low[32] for safety; or because the gaoler has the ground for\r\n  his own use. Prisoners confined in this manner are generally\r\n  unhealthy.\r\n\r\n  “In Baker’s Chronicle, p. 353, that historian, mentioning the assize\r\n  held in Oxford Castle, 1577 (called, from its fatal consequences, the\r\n  Black Assize), informs us, ‘that all who were present died within\r\n  forty hours; the lord chief baron, the sheriff, and about 300 more.’\r\n  Lord Chancellor Bacon ascribes this to a disease brought into court by\r\n  the prisoners; and Dr. Mead is of the same opinion.\r\n\r\n  “The first of these two authors, Lord Bacon, observes, that ‘the most\r\n  pernicious infection, next the plague, is the smell of a jail, when\r\n  the prisoners have been long close and nastily kept; whereof we have\r\n  had, in our time, experience twice or thrice; when both the judges\r\n  that sat upon the jail, and numbers of those who attended the\r\n  business, or were present, sickened and died.’\r\n\r\n  “Sir John Pringle observes that ‘gaols have often been the cause of\r\n  malignant fevers;’ and he informs us that in the late Rebellion in\r\n  Scotland, above 200 men of one regiment were infected with the gaol\r\n  fever by some deserters brought from prisons in England.\r\n\r\n  “Dr. Lind, physician to the royal hospital at Haslar, near Portsmouth,\r\n  showed me, in one of the wards, a number of sailors ill of the gaol\r\n  fever, brought on board their ship by a man who had been discharged\r\n  from a prison in London. The ship was laid up on the occasion. That\r\n  gentleman, in his ‘Essay on the Health of Seamen,’ asserts that ‘the\r\n  source of infection to our armies and fleets are undoubtedly the\r\n  gaols; we can often trace the importers of it directly from them. It\r\n  often proves fatal in impressing men on the hasty equipment of a\r\n  fleet. The first English fleet sent last war to America lost by it\r\n  above 2000 men. In another place he assures us that the seeds of\r\n  infection were carried from the guard-ships into our squadrons; and\r\n  the mortality thus occasioned was greater than by all other diseases\r\n  or means of death put together.’\r\n\r\n  “It were easy to multiply instances of this mischief; but those I have\r\n  mentioned are, I presume, sufficient to show, even if no mercy were\r\n  due to prisoners, that the gaol distemper is a ‘national concern’ of\r\n  no small importance.”\r\n\r\n  “_Sewers._—Some gaols have no sewers or vaults; and in those that\r\n  have, if they be not properly attended to, they are, even to a\r\n  visitant, offensive beyond description; how noxious, then, to people\r\n  confined constantly in those prisons!\r\n\r\n  “One cause why the rooms in some prisons are so close is the\r\n  window-tax, which the gaolers have to pay; this tempts them to stop\r\n  the windows and stifle their prisoners.\r\n\r\n  “_Bedding._—In many gaols, and in most bridewells, there is no\r\n  allowance of _bedding_ or straw for prisoners to sleep on; and if by\r\n  any means they get a little, it is not changed for months together, so\r\n  that it is offensive and almost worn to dust. Some lie upon rags,\r\n  others upon bare floors. When I have complained of this to the\r\n  keepers, their justification has been: ‘the county allows no straw;\r\n  the prisoners have none but at my cost.’”\r\n\r\nSince Howard succeeded in gaining national attention to the condition of\r\nprisoners, the evils of prison management have been removed. A large\r\nproportion of the prison population is taken from the worst regulated\r\nand most confined neighbourhoods, which have been the subject of\r\nexamination; and, with the view to judge what might be effected by\r\nsanitary regulations, I have made frequent inquiries as to the effects\r\nof sanitary measures on the worst class of persons, the larger\r\nproportion of whom are taken from the worst neighbourhoods, that is, as\r\nto the effects of living in the same atmosphere, on a less expensive\r\ndiet than that of the general labouring population, but provided with\r\nclean and tolerably well-ventilated places of work and sleeping-rooms,\r\nand where they are required to be cleanly in their persons.\r\n\r\nI have obtained through Mr. Hill, the prison inspector of Scotland, an\r\naccurate return of the number of days which the prisoners had been\r\nabsent from labour on the ground of ill health in the celebrated prison\r\nat Glasgow, where the separate system of confinement has been tried\r\n(Return No. 1); a similar return from the Edinburgh prison, (No. 2). I\r\nalso obtained a careful examination of the amount of sickness prevalent\r\namongst the prisoners at Salford prison, (No. 3). The average cost of\r\nthe diets, (principally vegetable,) at Salford, varied from 1_s._ 4_d._\r\nto 1_s._ 6_d._ per week; at Edinburgh, 1_s._ 9_d._ per week; and at\r\nGlasgow, 1_s._ 7_d._ per week. _Vide_ Appendix.\r\n\r\nThe medical practitioners, who are well acquainted with the general\r\nstate of health of the population surrounding the prisons concur in\r\nvouching to the fact, upon their own knowledge, that the health of the\r\nprisoners is in general much higher than the health almost of any part\r\nof the surrounding population; that the prisoners, as a class, are below\r\nthe average of health when they enter the prisons; that they come from\r\nthe worst neighbourhoods; that many of them come from the\r\nlodging-houses, which, in those towns, as will be shown, are the\r\nconstant seats of disease; that they are mostly persons of intemperate\r\nhabits; that many of them come in in a state of disease from\r\nintemperance and bad habits; and notwithstanding the depressing\r\ninfluence of imprisonment, the effect of cleanliness, dryness, better\r\nventilation, temperance, and simple food, is almost sufficient to\r\nprevent disease arising within the prison, and to put the prisoners in a\r\nbetter working condition at the termination than at the commencement of\r\ntheir imprisonment. At the Glasgow bridewell, the prisoners are weighed\r\non their entrance and at their discharge, and it is found that, on the\r\naverage, they gained in weight by their imprisonment.[33] At Edinburgh,\r\nthere were instances of poor persons in a state of disease committed\r\nfrom motives of humanity to the prison, that they might be taken care of\r\nand cured. The tables are to be taken as showing imperfectly the\r\ncomparative effects of the different circumstances; because, when a\r\nlabourer is obliged to leave work he loses wages; and it is known of\r\nlarge classes of them, that they often work improvidently and\r\ninjuriously to their chances of recovery by continuing at work in\r\nimpaired health too long; the prisoner, on the contrary, by absence on\r\nthe sick list, gains ease and exemption from slave labour; and the\r\nofficers have constantly to contend against feigned sickness to avoid\r\ntask-work and punishment. It should also be noted that a large\r\nproportion of the sickness of the prisoners is of a character that is\r\nexcluded from all tables of insurance, from the benefit societies as\r\nbeing specially excluded from their benefits. The numbers imprisoned at\r\nthe lower ages, or above 36 years of age, were too few to form any\r\ncomparison:—\r\n\r\n ┌────────┬─────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┐\r\n │        │ Average Annual Sickness of  │                                  │\r\n │        │    Male Prisoners in the    │    Labourers and Operatives.     │\r\n ├────────┼─────────┬─────────┬─────────┼───────────┬───────────┬──────────┤\r\n │        │         │         │         │           │  No. 5.   │          │\r\n │        │         │         │         │           │  Average  │          │\r\n │        │         │         │         │           │duration of│          │\r\n │        │         │         │         │  No. 4.   │ Sickness  │  No. 6.  │\r\n │        │ No. 1.  │ No. 2.  │ No. 3.  │Employed in│ per annum │ Males of │\r\n │        │ Glasgow │Edinburgh│ Salford │East-India │ of every  │ Families │\r\n │        │ Prison. │ Prison. │ Prison. │ Company’s │  person   │ in Wynds │\r\n │        │         │         │         │Warehouses.│employed in│    of    │\r\n │        │         │         │         │           │  Cotton   │Edinburgh.│\r\n │        │         │         │         │           │ Factories │          │\r\n │        │         │         │         │           │    of     │          │\r\n │        │         │         │         │           │Lancashire.│          │\r\n ├────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼───────────┼───────────┼──────────┤\r\n │  AGE.  │ Days &  │ Days &  │ Days &  │  Days &   │  Days &   │  Days &  │\r\n │        │Decimals.│Decimals.│Decimals.│ Decimals. │ Decimals. │Decimals. │\r\n │Under 16│         │         │         │           │           │       3·5│\r\n │ Years  │         │         │         │           │           │          │\r\n │16 to 21│     3·05│     4·01│     3·10│       4·02│       4·42│       2·3│\r\n │21 to 26│     1·83│     2·04│     1·64│       5·40│       4·91│       5·1│\r\n │26 to 31│     2·65│     2·33│     2·72│       4·49│       6·88│      11·0│\r\n │31 to 36│     2·83│     3·10│     2·63│       4·55│       3·85│       8·3│\r\n │36 to 41│     9·00│     5·10│      ·85│       5·57│       4·13│       4·1│\r\n │41 to 46│      ·49│     2·75│      ·51│       5·18│       5·69│      15·1│\r\n │46 to 51│         │         │         │       5·43│       7·18│      30·0│\r\n │51 to 56│         │         │         │       6·80│       3·47│      16·2│\r\n │56 to 61│         │         │         │       7·21│      12·68│      30·4│\r\n │61 to 66│         │         │         │      10·24│           │      42·7│\r\n │66 to 71│         │         │         │       9·93│           │      64·2│\r\n │71 to 76│         │         │         │      10·60│           │      41·0│\r\n │76 to 81│         │         │         │      12·67│           │      83·6│\r\n └────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴───────────┴───────────┴──────────┘\r\n\r\n ┌────────┬─────────┬─────────┬──────────┐\r\n │        │         │         │  No. 8.  │\r\n │        │         │         │ Average  │\r\n │        │         │         │  Annual  │\r\n │        │         │ No. 7.  │ Sickness │\r\n │        │         │ Average │    of    │\r\n │        │         │ Annual  │provident │\r\n │        │         │Sickness │portion of│\r\n │        │         │   of    │ Working  │\r\n │        │         │ Members │ Classes  │\r\n │        │         │   of    │throughout│\r\n │        │         │ Benefit │  Great   │\r\n │        │         │Societies│ Britain, │\r\n │        │         │   in    │according │\r\n │        │         │Scotland.│  to the  │\r\n │        │         │         │experience│\r\n │        │         │         │  of Mr.  │\r\n │        │         │         │Finlaison.│\r\n ├────────┼─────────┼─────────┼──────────┤\r\n │  AGE.  │Years of │ Days &  │  Days &  │\r\n │        │  Age.   │Decimals.│Decimals. │\r\n │Under 16│         │         │          │\r\n │ Years  │         │         │          │\r\n │16 to 21│       18│      2·5│      5·18│\r\n │21 to 26│       23│      3·8│      6·75│\r\n │26 to 31│       28│      4·6│      6·78│\r\n │31 to 36│       33│      5·6│      6·33│\r\n │36 to 41│       38│      6·2│      7·86│\r\n │41 to 46│       43│      8·8│      9·02│\r\n │46 to 51│       48│      9·1│     11·76│\r\n │51 to 56│       53│     14·8│     16·77│\r\n │56 to 61│       58│     17·8│     23·57│\r\n │61 to 66│       63│     20·0│     33·22│\r\n │66 to 71│       68│     36·0│     61·22│\r\n │71 to 76│       73│     38·6│    101·44│\r\n │76 to 81│       78│     70·9│    164·72│\r\n └────────┴─────────┴─────────┴──────────┘\r\n\r\nThe total number of male prisoners in the three prisons from which the\r\nreturns were compiled was 7,328; of which number, in the Glasgow prison\r\nthere were 1,796, in the Edinburgh prison 1,256, and in the Salford\r\nprison 4,276 prisoners. The columns inserted in the above table from the\r\nprisons give only the amount of sickness prevalent amongst the males.\r\nThe returns which are given in full in the Appendix contain the amount\r\nof sickness prevalent among the female prisoners also.\r\n\r\nThe information as to the actual amount of sickness prevalent amongst\r\nthe labouring classes is at present extremely defective for the purposes\r\nof insurance. One of the most authentic tables is that compiled by Dr.\r\nMitchell, from returns we obtained under the Factory Commission of\r\nInquiry, of the experience of sickness amongst the labourers employed by\r\nthe East India Company in their warehouses in London. The experience was\r\nfrom 2461 workmen employed during ten years. (Return No. 4.)\r\n\r\nThis is a highly favourable table, inasmuch as the men were, in the\r\nfirst instance, select, nearly as much so as recruits in the army; care\r\nwas also taken to give men who became infirm such labour as they could\r\nperform without exertion; but, above all, they had the benefit of\r\nmedical advice without any expense, and being thereby induced to make\r\nearly application, disease was cut short at once on its first\r\nappearance. Moreover, they were not allowed to return to work until they\r\nhad a medical certificate of their cure.\r\n\r\nAnother table (No. 5) given is one of the amount of sickness experienced\r\nby the male operatives in the cotton mills in England, also deduced from\r\nthe returns directed to be made under the Factory Commission of Inquiry.\r\nBut these returns do not include the experience of the mills in\r\nManchester, which was not collected by the district commissioners.\r\n\r\nThe table (No. 6) is that made up by Mr. Tait, surgeon, from his\r\ninquiries of the experience of sickness in the wynds of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nThe next table (No. 7) is made up from the experience of benefit\r\nsocieties in Scotland, subsequent to the experience tables which were\r\ncompiled by the Highland Society; but this is the experience of a select\r\nclass, which appears to me to be too favourable for general use in\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nThe next table (No. 8) is one in use by Mr. Finlaison, the actuary at\r\nthe National Debt Office, prepared from various sources of information.\r\nIt has been tried by the experience of a large benefit society in\r\nBethnal Green, and the allowance for sickness was found to be low as\r\ncompared with the sickness occurring amongst the labouring classes in\r\nthat district.\r\n\r\nThe account given by Mr. Tait, of his investigation of the sickness\r\nwhich had prevailed amongst 335 persons in 180 families, exhibited in\r\ncolumn No. 5, is as follows:—\r\n\r\n  “The parts visited may be considered a fair specimen of the Edinburgh\r\n  wynds and closes. They consist of Gillon’s and Gibb’s Closes,\r\n  Canongate, Blackfriars’ Wynd, Bremot’s and Skinner’s Closes, High\r\n  Street, and Meal-market Stairs, Cowgate. The drainage of all these\r\n  places is bad; the sewers are without exception open, and those in\r\n  Gillon’s and Gibb’s Closes being nearly on a dead level, keep these\r\n  places constantly in a filthy condition. The poverty of the\r\n  inhabitants who reside in Gibb’s Close, especially, is also extreme,\r\n  five out of seven families living in apartments without furniture. The\r\n  ventilation in general is also bad: several apartments are so close\r\n  that it is difficult for a person when he first enters them to\r\n  breathe. In several instances I had to retreat to the door to write\r\n  down my notes, as I found the stench and close atmosphere produce a\r\n  sickening sensation which, on one occasion, terminated in vomiting.\r\n  Although some of the apartments visited were tidy and clean, in\r\n  general they were the reverse. It is impossible to conceive or\r\n  describe the filthy condition of some of them. Many of them were very\r\n  small, and others rather capacious, considering the quantity of\r\n  furniture they contained. The diseases mentioned were such as to throw\r\n  the persons affected out of employment. There were many cases of\r\n  slight and continued ailment of which no notice was taken. No case of\r\n  rheumatism was taken down unless so severe as to lay the person\r\n  entirely off work.\r\n\r\n  “About 180 families were visited, but only 117 of them had been one\r\n  year and upwards in their present dwelling: all the cases of sickness\r\n  occurred between Martinmas, 1840, and Martinmas, 1841, and none of the\r\n  patients,” _i. e._ of whom any account was taken, “were under ten\r\n  years of age,” those under that age being intentionally excluded.\r\n\r\nMr. Hill states, that he has no doubt the results, which will be\r\napparent from the examination of the several tables which are placed in\r\njuxta-position, would be corroborated by similar returns obtained from\r\nother well-regulated prisons in Scotland. The returns from the prisons\r\nin England up to the year 1834–5 (which do not, however, give the days\r\nof sickness, but only the number of prisoners attacked with sickness\r\nduring the period for which the return was made) further corroborate\r\nthese results. Even in the Milbank Penitentiary, the situation of which\r\nis insalubrious, the average annual amount of sickness to the prisoners\r\nwho are confined two years and a half is only about eight days to each\r\nperson, which, for the average ages, is little above the standard\r\nobtained from the experience of the East India Company’s labourers. The\r\nsickness amongst the metropolitan police is about 10½ days per annum for\r\neach of the force, 2¾ per cent. being constantly on the sick-list. The\r\nsickness in the army is on the average 14½ days each soldier. Mr.\r\nFinlaison informs me he can venture to state, that were any benefit\r\nsociety to use scales of premiums founded on the prison experience, they\r\nwould inevitably be insolvent in less than three years.\r\n\r\nM. Villermé has shown the diminution of mortality that has taken place\r\nin the prisons of France, chiefly from stricter attention to\r\ncleanliness, ventilation, and diet, to be equally striking. At Lyons,\r\nfrom 1800 to 1806, the annual mortality in the prisons was 1 in 19; from\r\n1806 to 1812, it was 1 in 31; from 1812 to 1819, it was 1 in 34; and\r\nfrom 1820 to 1826, 1 in 43: a similar amelioration has also been\r\nremarked in the prisons of Rouen, and some other large towns in that\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary return of the diseases of the duration of\r\neach, amongst the population of the wynds, examined by Mr. Tait:—\r\n\r\n ┌───────────────────────────┬──────┬────────┬───────┬────────┬────────┐\r\n │    NATURE OF DISEASE.     │No. of│Average │No. of │ No. of │ No. of │\r\n │                           │Cases.│duration│Deaths.│Families│Persons │\r\n │                           │      │   of   │       │visited.│visited.│\r\n │                           │      │Disease.│       │        │        │\r\n ├───────────────────────────┼──────┼────────┼───────┼────────┼────────┤\r\n │                           │      │ Weeks. │       │        │        │\r\n │Disease of Lungs           │    23│      5½│      1│     117│     335│\r\n │Rheumatism                 │     9│       9│       │        │        │\r\n │Accidents                  │     9│      4½│       │        │        │\r\n │Erysipelas                 │     3│       8│       │        │        │\r\n │Inflammation of Throat     │     3│       5│       │        │        │\r\n │Fever                      │    15│      5¼│      1│        │        │\r\n │Palsy                      │     4│        │      1│        │        │\r\n │Dropsy                     │     1│       7│       │        │        │\r\n │Disease of Liver           │     1│        │       │        │        │\r\n │Jaundice                   │     1│       4│       │        │        │\r\n │Carbuncle                  │     1│       5│       │        │        │\r\n │Affection of Urinary Organs│     1│      17│       │        │        │\r\n │Acute affection of Brain   │     2│       3│      1│        │        │\r\n │Small-pox                  │     2│       5│      1│        │        │\r\n │Opthalmia                  │     1│       6│       │        │        │\r\n │Whitlow                    │     1│       3│       │        │        │\r\n │Lumbago                    │     2│       7│       │        │        │\r\n │Eruptive disease           │     1│       9│       │        │        │\r\n │Inflammation of Stomach    │     1│        │       │        │        │\r\n │Ague                       │     1│       4│       │        │        │\r\n │Abscess of Loins           │     1│       5│       │        │        │\r\n ├───────────────────────────┼──────┼────────┼───────┼────────┼────────┤\r\n │           Total           │    83│        │      5│     117│     335│\r\n └───────────────────────────┴──────┴────────┴───────┴────────┴────────┘\r\n\r\nIt may be safely pronounced that if such an amount of sickness were\r\nknown to prevail in a prison containing between 300 and 400 prisoners,\r\nthe circumstance would excite public alarm and attention.\r\n\r\nAny of the preceding tables of the lower amounts of sickness may be\r\ntaken as practicable standards of the extent to which it were possible,\r\nby the removal of the causes of disease, to bring the health of the\r\nlabouring population.\r\n\r\nI may here observe, that the tables of sickness above referred to\r\nexhibit the very unsatisfactory footing on which the means of insurance\r\nagainst sickness and mortality within the reach of the labouring classes\r\nare now placed. An artisan of the condition of the East India Company’s\r\nlabourers who insures for an allowance for sickness between the age of\r\n61 and 66 years, which, according to the experience of his own class,\r\nwould be a period of 10 days, would have to pay for 20 days, or 10 days\r\nin excess if he insured on the tables of the experience of benefit\r\nsocieties in Scotland, or 23 days in excess if he insured on tables\r\nfounded on the experience collected by Mr. Finlaison. On the other hand,\r\nwere a benefit society composed of members living under depressed\r\ncircumstances, as in close courts or ill-drained districts, to adopt the\r\ntable of the experience of the East India Company’s labourers, and to\r\ntake members, living under the circumstances indicated by the Highland\r\nsocieties or Mr. Finlaison’s tables, the allowance on such a rate of\r\ninsurance would be fraught with certain and speedy loss of the funds of\r\nthe contributors. Having received contributions for an allowance on the\r\nchances of 10 days’ sickness, they would, upon insurances from the wynds\r\nof Edinburgh, have to pay for 40 days. The range of variation in the\r\nchances of life in different districts, such as have been shown in the\r\nreturns from the different towns, exhibiting the mortality amongst the\r\ndifferent classes, all present instances of the ruin to which benefit\r\nsocieties are exposed in acting upon tables calculated only for select\r\nclasses, or on the mean experience of large classes, or of many classes\r\ndiffering widely in their circumstances. The probabilities of life at\r\ninfancy for the whole population of Liverpool, as deduced from the\r\nactual ages of deaths of the whole population, would be 17 years; but on\r\nthe Northampton tables of probability, payment would be required for the\r\ninsurance of 25 years at infancy; for 38 years according to the Carlisle\r\ntable; and if a male, for 37 years, according to the Swedish table. Yet\r\nsuch are the data and their applications on which large masses of\r\nsavings and property are frequently invested and made dependent in\r\nvarious forms of insurance in benefit societies. The ruin of such\r\nsocieties is, I lament to say, by no means an unfrequent occurrence. The\r\nmost painful spectacle that is presented in a painful and difficult\r\nservice is that of a hardworking, industrious labourer, who has lived\r\nfrugally and saved rigidly, who in his old age is stripped of his\r\nsavings and reduced to destitution. One such example is enough to\r\ndestroy the frugality of a whole village, and of all the labourers to\r\nwhom it is presented. The necessity of a revision of all the tables\r\nwhich govern the subscriptions to friendly societies and the allowances\r\nfrom them, is strongly suggested by the evidence. It is to be lamented\r\nthat, before giving tables of sickness or mortality to the members of\r\nbenefit societies, many of the actuaries who have advised them have made\r\nno inquiries as to the condition of the neighbourhoods where the members\r\nreside or as to their general circumstances. The best advice to the\r\nlabourers for the future will, however, be proved to be, that the most\r\nsafe, economical, and efficient outlay as an insurance, will be in their\r\nown contributions, in rates or extra rent where needful for the\r\nexecution of sanitary measures.\r\n\r\nThe further example adverted to as to the efficiency of preventive\r\nmeasures, is furnished by the naval medical service.\r\n\r\nSo dreadful was once the condition of the navy that, in the year 1726,\r\nwhen Admiral Hosier sailed with seven ships of the line to the West\r\nIndies, he buried his ships’ companies twice, and died himself of a\r\nbroken heart. Amongst the pictures then presented, as in Anson’s\r\nVoyages, 1740–44, were those of deaths to the amount of eight or ten\r\na-day in a moderate ship’s company; bodies sewn up in hammocks and\r\nwashing about the decks, for want of strength and spirit on the part of\r\nthe miserable survivors to cast them overboard. Dr. Johnson, in the year\r\n1778, thus describes a sea life:—“As to the sailor, when you look down\r\nfrom the quarter-deck to the space below, you see the utmost extremity\r\nof human misery; such crowding, such filth, such stench!” “A ship is a\r\nprison, with the chance of being drowned,—it is worse, worse in every\r\nrespect; worse air, worse food, worse company.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. Wilson_, in his preface to the Medical Returns, observes that,\r\nwithin the limits of the South American command, the Centurion, exactly\r\na century ago, lost in a few weeks 200 out of 400 men by scurvy. During\r\nthe years from 1830 to 1836, the British _squadron_ employed in South\r\nAmerica, lost by diseases of every description only 115 out of 17,254\r\nmen. He observes—\r\n\r\n  “There is no reason to doubt that instead of every second man\r\n  perishing miserably within a few weeks, the rate of mortality might\r\n  have been as low as that exhibited in the South American Report, viz.,\r\n  one death annually by disease out of 150 men. Now there was nothing\r\n  new nor mysterious in the pestilence either as to its origin or its\r\n  essence: it was not a sudden climatorial influence which could not be\r\n  resisted nor understood; it was a well-known affection presenting all\r\n  the signs of utter prostration and pointing to pure debility as its\r\n  source, the effects principally of scanty, unwholesome, unvarying diet\r\n  and bad water—partly of inadequate attention to cleanliness, order,\r\n  and ventilation, and the nearly total neglect of systematic attention\r\n  to measures for amusing, cheering, and improving the mind with which\r\n  resulting despondency often cooperated. The remedy therefore would\r\n  appear to have been self-evident and at hand, not to the commanders of\r\n  ships and fleets, but to the administration. Information on many\r\n  points in the animal economy was certainly less exact than it is now,\r\n  and vague unfounded notions prevailed of necessary relations existing\r\n  between a sea-life and scurvy. Hence it may be concluded that\r\n  ignorance rather than inhumanity was the reason why effectual measures\r\n  were not long before adopted for the prevention of such terrible\r\n  calamities.”\r\n\r\nHe observes further that—\r\n\r\nIn 1779 the proportion dying was 1 in 8 of the employed.\r\n\r\nIn 1811 the proportion dying was 1 in 32 of the employed.\r\n\r\n  From 1830 to 1836 the average number dying annually was 1 in 72 of the\r\n  employed.\r\n\r\nBut—\r\n\r\n  “In this calculation, the deaths from all sources are included from\r\n  wounds, drowning, and all other external causes as well as from\r\n  disease. From the latter source the deaths were in the proportion of 1\r\n  to 85 of the number employed annually. When it is considered that the\r\n  ratio applies to the whole service, and therefore includes the most\r\n  unhealthy sections, the Coast of Africa and the West Indies, it will\r\n  be admitted, even without reference to former periods, to be very\r\n  low.”[34]\r\n\r\nThe scurvy, once so fatal in the navy, is now almost unknown in\r\nmen-of-war, whilst it still prevails often to a most serious extent in\r\nthe mercantile navy where the same care is not taken. It was a popular\r\nopinion in the navy, that the use of lemon juice in the grog was a\r\nspecific against scurvy; but it is stated that the health of seamen has\r\nin some instances been advanced by the discontinuance of the grog\r\nitself, and the substitution of coffee. _Dr. Nisbett_ says, “I may state\r\ngenerally, that this substance (lemon juice) in the quantities usually\r\nissued (one ounce per diem) does not prevent the appearance of scurvy\r\nunder circumstances favourable to its production; that in increased\r\nquantities it appears to have some power of arresting, at least for a\r\ntime, this disease in its earlier stages, and is thus of great value;\r\nbut that it is not to be considered an antidote, and that the only cure\r\nfor this disease is a full diet of fresh meat and vegetables;” the\r\npreventives being, general and personal cleanliness, ventilation, and\r\nliberal supplies of good water, in addition to supplies of wholesome\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nThe mortality of the home force ships employed chiefly in harbour duty,\r\n&c. (where of course they were not cut off from communication or means\r\nof infection from the shore,) in Great Britain and Ireland, gives the\r\nrate of mortality obtainable by sanitary means, even now confessedly\r\nimperfect especially in ventilation, amongst a male population ranging\r\nfrom 15 to 50 years of age, and may be taken as illustrative of the\r\namount of health attainable on shore.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 the deaths in the navy from disease independently of external\r\ncauses were—\r\n\r\n                  Disease, per 1000. All Causes, per 1000.\r\n             1830                6·0                   8·7\r\n             1831               11·5                   3·4\r\n             1832               11·9                  14·0\r\n             1833                6·3                   7·9\r\n             1834                4·9                   6·7\r\n             1835                5·9                   7·2\r\n             1836                7·5                   9·5\r\n\r\nMr. Finlaison has lately calculated that the deaths _on shore_ out of\r\n1000 of the population of 29 years of age may be estimated at about 12\r\nper annum. Mr. Rickman calculated that the deaths at that age in Essex\r\nand Rutland would be about 12½ persons per 1000 per annum: for the\r\nmetropolis it would be about 15½ deaths. Out of 1000 workmen in the\r\nGovernment dock-yards, the number of deaths were 15; and hitherto in the\r\nmetropolitan police force, which is more select than the navy, the\r\nnumber of deaths appear to be about 9 per annum; but about the same\r\nnumber of men is annually invalided from the force. The proportion of\r\ndeaths amongst the troops appears to be, amongst the household cavalry,\r\n14·5, amongst the dragoons 15·3, amongst the infantry in depôt, 18·5,\r\nand amongst the foot guards 21·6. Since the Guards have been in Canada\r\nthe rate of mortality has been reduced to that of other regiments.\r\n\r\nThe health of the foot guards is believed to be affected by peculiar\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nI may add, as respects soldiers, that by proper care such epidemics as\r\ntyphus, scarlet fever, are now scarcely known as affecting large groups\r\nin the army, and that such an occurrence would denote to the chiefs of\r\nthe army medical board the existence of some great neglect into which it\r\nwould be necessary to make inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Cost to tenants and owners of the public measures for drainage,\r\n   cleansing, and the supplies of water, as compared with the cost of\r\n                               sickness._\r\n\r\nPersons well acquainted with the inferior descriptions of tenements in\r\nManchester state that a large proportion of them change owners in ten\r\nyears, and that few remain in the same hands more than twenty years; and\r\nit is observed in other populous districts that this description of\r\nproperty most frequently changes hands. The chief obstacle to the\r\nexecution of legislative measures for public improvements of tenements\r\nof the class in question in such districts has been, that large\r\nimmediate outlays of capital have been required to be made in an\r\ninconvenient manner for permanent improvements, by persons possessing\r\nonly short or transient interests, to whom no means are given for\r\nspreading the charge over longer periods of years to make it coincident\r\nwith the benefits.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the structural arrangements which come within the public\r\nauthority, the majority of professional persons the best acquainted with\r\nthe description of tenements occupied by the poorer classes, and the\r\nimportance of getting the work done, agree that it would, on the whole,\r\nbe the most advantageous course to execute them, by loans paying\r\ninterest on the security of the rates, and spread the charge over 30\r\nyears during which the original outlay should be repaid. This would\r\nallow of the annual instalment being charged in fair proportions to the\r\ntenant, and to the holders of short interests.\r\n\r\nThe outlay for the execution of measures which come within the public\r\nauthority are those, 1, for bringing water on the premises; 2, for\r\napplying it to remove refuse by a cheap apparatus; 3, a drain for\r\nconveyance of the refuse to the (4) main drains or common sewer.\r\n\r\nIn the rural districts all these purposes of cleansing may, it is\r\nconsidered, be accomplished by means of a proper use of the rain-water;\r\nand that which is here given may be considered as a maximum estimate for\r\n_towns_, if the work be properly done by public contract on a large\r\nscale.\r\n\r\n ┌───────────────────────────┬──────────┬────────────┬──────────┐\r\n │                           │          │            │  Weekly  │\r\n │                           │          │            │Charge to │\r\n │                           │          │            │   the    │\r\n │                           │          │   Annual   │Tenant, or│\r\n │                           │  Annual  │ interest,  │increased │\r\n │                           │Instalment│commuted at │  Rent,   │\r\n │First Outlay per Tenement. │   for    │5 per cent. │being the │\r\n │                           │Repayment │ on Outlay  │  1/54th  │\r\n │                           │in Thirty │ charged as │ part of  │\r\n │                           │  Years.  │  Rent on   │the sum of│\r\n │                           │          │  Tenant.   │the annual│\r\n │                           │          │            │instalment│\r\n │                           │          │            │and annual│\r\n │                           │          │            │interest. │\r\n ├──────────────┬────────────┼──────────┼────────────┼──────────┤\r\n │              │£. _s._ _d._│_s._  _d._│£. _s._ _d._│   _d._   │\r\n │Water-tank[35]│            │          │            │          │\r\n │  and         │10    8    6│    6   11│ 0    6    8│    3     │\r\n │  apparatus   │            │          │            │          │\r\n │Sewer         │ 5   12    0│    3    9│ 0    3    6│    1½    │\r\n │Water         │            │          │ 0    5    0│    1     │\r\n ├──────────────┴────────────┼──────────┼────────────┼──────────┤\r\n │           Total           │   10    8│ 0   15    2│    5½    │\r\n └───────────────────────────┴──────────┴────────────┴──────────┘\r\n\r\n ┌───────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┐\r\n │                           │  Total Outlay on One-third   │\r\n │First Outlay per Tenement. │ (1,148,282 inhabited houses) │\r\n │                           │ of the existing Tenements in │\r\n │                           │ England, Wales and Scotland. │\r\n ├───────────────────────────┼──────────┬──────────┬────────┤\r\n │                           │          │          │ Annual │\r\n │                           │          │          │Interest│\r\n │                           │          │  Annual  │commuted│\r\n │                           │          │Instalment│at 5 per│\r\n │                           │  First   │   for    │cent. on│\r\n │                           │ Outlay.  │Repayment │ Outlay │\r\n │                           │          │in Thirty │charged │\r\n │                           │          │  Years.  │as Rent │\r\n │                           │          │          │   on   │\r\n │                           │          │          │Tenant. │\r\n ├──────────────┬────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼────────┤\r\n │              │£. _s._ _d._│    £.    │    £.    │   £.   │\r\n │Water-tank[35]│            │          │          │        │\r\n │  and         │10    8    6│11,970,840│   399,028│ 379,687│\r\n │  apparatus   │            │          │          │        │\r\n │Sewer         │ 5   12    0│ 6,430,379│   214,346│ 203,957│\r\n │Water         │            │          │          │        │\r\n ├──────────────┴────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼────────┤\r\n │           Total           │18,401,219│   613,374│ 583,644│\r\n └───────────────────────────┴──────────┴──────────┴────────┘\r\n\r\nThe above is a maximum estimate, and if the work be executed\r\nsystematically by contract for districts, the charge may be so far\r\nreduced that it may be taken to include repairs, but if it were executed\r\nby each occupier or each owner separately, 15 per cent. must be added to\r\nthe charge; and if, in addition to the separate charge incurred by\r\nneglect of legislative or administrative arrangements there be also\r\nincurred the ordinary fees of new surveyors of sewers, and new surveyors\r\nof buildings, paid by the ordinary fees, the charge for these structural\r\nimprovements will be still further increased.\r\n\r\nBut the supplies of water for all the household purposes at the highest\r\nwater company’s charges, which is 138 pailsful for less than 1¼_d._, is,\r\nin fact, to be considered a reduction of an existing expenditure of\r\nlabour of fetching water.\r\n\r\nThe cost of cleansing privies is estimated as an existing charge in the\r\nmetropolis and many towns of not less than 10_s._ per tenement annually.\r\nIf the duty were duly performed the cost would perhaps be double that\r\namount, and be equivalent to the whole of the proposed new expenditure;\r\nand taking the new expenditure as being less that charge, there only\r\nremains the cost of the new sewerage,—1½_d._ weekly, or 6_s._ 6_d._\r\nannually. Supposing this charge of 1½_d._ weekly imposed upon the\r\nlandlord, he will have to set against it the preservation of the\r\ntenement from dilapidation by drainage, which of itself would frequently\r\nrepay the whole outlay. He has also the circumstance to consider that he\r\nmay get better tenants by the improvement of his houses, and that with\r\nsuch tenants he will have more regular payments of rent. Protracted\r\nsickness and protracted losses of employment, and the frequent mortality\r\ncaused by neglect of cleansing, occasion heavy losses to the owners, and\r\noccasion a greater diminution of the returns for such tenements than is\r\ncommonly apparent.\r\n\r\nOne obstruction to any amendment by cleansing is occasioned by the\r\ncircumstance that the laying on the water is considered a tenant’s\r\ncharge, and the lower the class the more fluctuating the tenantry and\r\nthe greater the reluctance of the tenant, and the less indeed are the\r\nmeans to make any immediate outlay for permanent purposes. To cast any\r\nimmediate outlay on occupiers of this class, who have scarcely\r\nself-control to make reserves of the weekly rents, practically amounts\r\nto a prohibition of the work being done. That which will in extensive\r\ndistricts really be a new charge, _i. e._, sewerage, will fall only at\r\nthe rate of the 1½_d._ per week per tenement, and as most tenements are\r\nnow occupied in the more crowded districts, this will be a charge to be\r\ndivided between two families. If it were properly distributed, it is an\r\namount not to be spoken of as serious in the weekly charge.[36]\r\n\r\nNew charges, for improved house accommodation, as well as for sewerage\r\nand house cleansing, may all be submitted as means for the reduction of\r\nthe existing heavy charges of sickness, and of the loss of work and loss\r\nof wages consequent upon sickness. To judge of the extent of the\r\nimmediate charge of sickness in money and _time_, which is independent\r\nof the charge of insurance against premature death, we may select the\r\ncase of an ordinary family, say of a man at 40, a wife at 30, and two\r\nchildren, who may be represented as equivalent to one child aged 15, the\r\nlowest age estimated in the insurance tables, which for an average\r\nfamily is an under estimate. Now to insure these a payment of 10_s._ per\r\nweek each during sickness, the charges would be as follows, according to\r\nthe insurance tables computed by Mr. Finlaison for the guidance of\r\nbenefit societies.\r\n\r\n ┌───────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────┐\r\n │              Age              │  For an allowance of 10_s._ per   │\r\n │                               │week, during sickness, according to│\r\n │                               │   the Table constructed by Mr.    │\r\n │                               │   Finlaison, the Actuary of the   │\r\n │                               │       National Debt Office.       │\r\n ├───────────────────────────────┼─────────────────┬─────────────────┤\r\n │                               │Monthly Payment. │ Single Payment. │\r\n ├───────────────────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┤\r\n │                               │   £.  _s._  _d._│   £.  _s._  _d._│\r\n │Man, 40                        │    0     2    11│   27     5     2│\r\n │Woman, 30                      │    0     1   11½│   21     0     6│\r\n │Child, 15                      │    0     1    3¼│   14    18     1│\r\n ├───────────────────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┤\r\n │Total per family               │    0     6    1¾│   63     3     9│\r\n ├───────────────────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┤\r\n │Total annual charge            │    3    13     9│                 │\r\n ├───────────────────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┤\r\n │Total weekly charge per family │    0     1     5│                 │\r\n └───────────────────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┘\r\n\r\nIn the course of the Factory Commission of Inquiry in 1834, we\r\nascertained that the wages of upwards of 40,000 employed in the cotton\r\nmills, of whom two-thirds were below the adolescent stage, amounted, on\r\nthe average, to 10_s._ 5_d._ per week. Up to the beginning of the\r\npresent year the wages of those in work were not lower. Mr. Finlaison’s\r\ntable, therefore, will best represent the existing pecuniary charge of\r\nsickness from the loss of wages to a family in such a district in\r\nordinary seasons of employment. The actual charge of sickness in _time_\r\nlost every year, as represented by the experience of the sickness tables\r\nbefore cited, would be as follows:—\r\n\r\n ┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐\r\n │    Age.     │Experience of│Experience of│     Mr.     │ Experience  │\r\n │             │the Wynds of │   Benefit   │ Finlaison.  │    under    │\r\n │             │ Edinburgh.  │Societies in │             │  Sanitary   │\r\n │             │             │  Scotland.  │             │  Measures.  │\r\n ├─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┤\r\n │             │  Days, &c.  │  Days, &c.  │  Days, &c.  │  Days, &c.  │\r\n │Man, 40      │         15·1│          6·9│          9·2│         2·75│\r\n │Woman, 30    │         11·0│          4·2│         6·33│         2·10│\r\n │Child, 15    │          3·5│          0·2│         5·18│         0·17│\r\n ├─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┤\r\n │Total per    │         29·6│         11·3│        20·71│         5·02│\r\n │  family     │             │             │             │             │\r\n └─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe experience of the effect of sanitary measures proves the possibility\r\nof the reduction of sickness in the worst districts to at least\r\none-third of the existing amount. Amidst classes somewhat better\r\nsituated, it were possible to reduce the sickness to less than\r\none-third; it were an under estimate to take the probable reduction at\r\none-half. Taking it, however, at one-half, by the new payment of 1½_d._,\r\nor say 2_d._, weekly for drainage, the occupants of the tenements will\r\nsave 7½_d._ of the weekly contribution for an allowance of 10_s._ per\r\nweek each during sickness. But the allowance insured to be paid during\r\nsickness only replaces the earnings: the sickness, besides its own\r\nmisery, entails the expense of medical attendance, which, at the usual\r\nrate of insurance in medical clubs, would be 5_s._ or 6_s._ per annum\r\nfor such a family. This would also be reduced one-half, making the total\r\nfamily saving at the least 9_d._ weekly. But the single payment for\r\nstructural alterations is to be regarded as general, and as a means of\r\naffecting the whole of the objects for the whole of the population. For\r\nthis 2_d._ each tenement, or 1_d._ each family, then, they will not only\r\nsave double the weekly amount, but they will save, in the wear and tear\r\nof shoes and clothes, from having a well-drained and well-cleansed\r\ninstead of a wet and miry district to traverse; they will also save the\r\nsickness itself, and each individual will gain a proportionate extension\r\nof a more healthy life. In a district where the wages are not one-half\r\nthe amount above stated, the expenditure for efficient means of\r\nprevention would still leave a surplus of gain to the labourer.\r\n\r\nThese are the chief gains on the side of the labourer; but in general\r\nevery labourer over and above what he consumes himself, produces enough\r\nto repay the interest on capital and cost of superintendence or the\r\nprofits of the employer. The loss of this extra production is the loss\r\nof the community during the whole time the services of the labourer are\r\nabridged by sickness or death. To this loss is to be added, where the\r\nlabourer has made no reserve, the loss of the cost of his unproductive\r\nmaintenance as a pauper, and of medical attendance during sickness.\r\n\r\nThe existing insurance charge, then, represents the existing charge on\r\nthe labouring classes from the loss of wages consequent on sickness; to\r\nwhich charge might be added the existing additional charge denoted by\r\nthe insurance on account of the abridged duration of life and more\r\nfrequent deaths. The aggregate charge for structural improvements,\r\nthough amounting to so many millions as a first outlay, is still, for\r\nthe reasons above stated, only a means of obtaining an incalculably\r\ngreater gain. But it will be shown that the attainment of that gain is\r\ndependent on securities for the application of science to the efficient\r\nexecution of the combined structural means of prevention. If these were\r\nto be no better than those in use in the greater part of the metropolis\r\nand the towns throughout the country, and the outlay for drainage were\r\nto be an outlay for receptacles to serve as the means of accumulating\r\ndecomposing deposits, and as latent magazines of pestilential gases, to\r\nbe themselves cleansed from time to time of the accumulations at a great\r\nexpense, or to be discharged to pollute the natural streams of the\r\ncountry, then the aggregate expenditure would, to the amount of the\r\ninefficiency, be an aggregate of so many millions of money spent in\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\nThe _immediate_ cost of sickness and loss of employment falls\r\ndifferently in different parts of the country, but on whatsoever fund it\r\ndoes fall, it will be a gain to apply to the means of prevention that\r\nfund which is and must needs otherwise continue to be more largely\r\napplied to meet the charge of maintenance and remedies. Admitting,\r\nhowever, as a fact the misconception intended to be obviated, that the\r\nnecessary expense of structural arrangements will be an immediate charge\r\ninstead of an immediate means of relief to the labouring classes;—in\r\nproof that they have, in ordinary times, not only the means of defraying\r\nincreased public rates but increased rents, I refer to the fact that the\r\namount expended in ardent spirits (exclusive of wines), tobacco, snuff,\r\nbeer, &c., consumed chiefly by them, cannot be much less than from\r\n45,000,000_l._ to 50,000,000_l._ per annum in the United Kingdom. By an\r\nestimate which I obtained from an eminent spirit merchant, of the cost\r\nto the consumer of the British spirits on which duty is paid, the annual\r\nexpenditure on them alone, chiefly by the labouring classes, cannot be\r\nless than 24,000,000_l._ per annum. If visible evidence of the means of\r\npayment were needed I would point to every gin-palace in the metropolis,\r\nor to similar places throughout the country, which are chiefly supported\r\nfrom the expenditure of the class of persons who are overcrowded and\r\nlodge most wretchedly, and its duty-paying building materials represents\r\na portion of the money available as rent for abodes of comparative\r\ncomfort. The cost of one dram per week would nearly defray the expense\r\nof the structural arrangements of drainage, &c., by which some of the\r\nstrongest provocatives to the habit of drunkenness would be removed. In\r\nillustration of the extent of the means of defraying such expenses, even\r\nin some of the poorer districts, I would cite the following statement of\r\nthe minister of the parish of Stevenston, in Ayrshire, given in the last\r\nstatistical account from that parish:—\r\n\r\n  “When the survey by the present incumbent was completed in 1836, the\r\n  population stood as follows:—\r\n\r\n                      Number of families      833\r\n                      Number of population 3681.”\r\n\r\nThe report further states—\r\n\r\n  “There are in the parish no less than 33 inns, and public-houses, and\r\n  whisky-shops. A few inns are needed for the accommodation of\r\n  travellers, and for the transaction of business; but the rest serve as\r\n  so many decoys to lure and destroy the thoughtless in their\r\n  neighbourhood. The sale of spirits in grocers’ shops has had a most\r\n  pernicious influence, especially on the female part of the community,\r\n  who, when there is no danger of detection, are tempted to add a dram\r\n  to the other commodities purchased. But the most pernicious practice\r\n  is that of several families clubbing that they may drink together\r\n  cheaply in one of their own houses; for in this way husbands, wives,\r\n  and children all share in the debauch, and drunken habits are\r\n  perpetuated from generation to generation.\r\n\r\n  “We are grieved and ashamed to mention the sum annually expended in\r\n  this parish for ardent spirits. We have learned from the\r\n  excise-officer of the district the quantity sold in it last year; and\r\n  without taking into account what is bought at a distance for the use\r\n  of private families, and exclusive also of all that is expended for\r\n  wine, and ale, and porter, and beer, and calculating at a rate greatly\r\n  below the retail price the quantity of ardent spirits sold in the\r\n  parish, it amounts to the enormous sum of 4125_l._”\r\n\r\nThis is nearly at the rate of 5_l._ a-year per family for ardent spirits\r\nalone. To give another example:—\r\n\r\nIn the town of Bury, with an estimated population of 25,000, the\r\nexpenditure in beer and spirits is estimated at 54,190_l._, annually, or\r\n2_l._ 3_s._ 4_d._ for each man, woman, and child, a sum that would pay\r\nthe rent and taxes for upwards of 6770 new cottages at 8_l._ per annum\r\neach. But on an inquiry made from house to house by the agency of the\r\nManchester Statistical Society into the condition of the labouring\r\npopulation of this town, with such an expenditure on one source of\r\ndissipation and ill-health, it appeared that of 2755 of their dwellings\r\nexamined, only 1668 were decidedly comfortable; that a smaller number\r\nwere well furnished; that the number of families in which there were\r\nless than two persons sleeping in one bed were only 413; that the number\r\nin which on the average there were more than two persons to a bed was\r\n1512; that the number of families who had not less than _three_ persons\r\nin a bed and less than four, was 773; that the number of families in\r\nwhich there were “at least four persons, but less than five persons to\r\none bed,” was 207. There were 63 families where there were at least five\r\npersons to one bed; and there were some in which even six were packed in\r\none bed, lying at the top and bottom—children and adults. Similar\r\nresults as to misapplied means and numbers crowded together would be\r\nascertained from similar inquiries into the state of the population in\r\nother districts.\r\n\r\nAny measures must commend themselves to public support that would effect\r\nin the application of the immense fund expended in ardent spirits alone,\r\na change for assured physical comforts and undoubted moral advantages of\r\nthe highest order. Admitting the validity of statements often made and\r\nseldom proved in ordinary times, but which nevertheless may occur, of\r\nclasses of labourers reduced to the minimum of subsistence, that their\r\nwages will not admit of any change of application, then another set of\r\nconsiderations would arise, namely, whether the increased charges for\r\nnew tenements, or for improvement of the existing tenements, will not\r\ncompel an advance of wages, and thence be charged in the cost of the\r\ncommodity produced? And whether if the trade will not allow such\r\nadvanced wages, the amount of misery of the labouring classes is not\r\nreally increased by exemptions or legislative facilities, which allow\r\nthe trade to be carried on only at the expense of the health, the\r\nmorality and the comfort of the labourers engaged in it, and also at the\r\nexpense of the ratepayers in providing against the casualties of\r\nsickness and mortality?\r\n\r\nThese, however, are questions that appear to be less likely to occur\r\npractically to any important extent than may be supposed. The general\r\ndifficulty would apparently be with the habits of the adults, who will,\r\nto use the illustration presented in a portion of evidence previously\r\ncited, “prefer the gin” to the best accommodation that can be offered to\r\nthem.[37]\r\n\r\nWhilst there is such evidence as that above cited to show that there is\r\nin ordinary times no real need, there is much evidence to show the\r\nimpolicy of any exemptions from the payment of properly distributed\r\ncharges for the requisite public improvement. In general labourers have\r\nbeen losers by exemptions from charges on their tenements, and scarcely\r\nin any instance have gained even by exemptions from the payment of their\r\ncontributions to the poor’s rates.\r\n\r\nThe effect of administrative proceedings on the condition of the\r\ndwellings of large portions of the labouring classes, and thence on the\r\ncondition of the labourers, is, under varied circumstances, adverted to\r\nin the local reports on their sanitary condition, and it is shown that\r\nthe former parochial administration has operated mischievously in\r\ndegrading the habitations of the labouring classes, or in checking\r\ntendencies to improvement.\r\n\r\nThe mode by which the condition of the dwellings of the labouring\r\nclasses has been most extensively deteriorated in England, has been by\r\nthe facility afforded to owners of cottage tenements, usually when\r\nacting as administrators of the Poor Law, to get their own tenants\r\nexcused from the payment of rates. The legal ground for exemption was,\r\nnot the value of the tenement, but the destitution or inability of the\r\ntenant to pay; but inasmuch as the occupation of a well-conditioned\r\ntenement, or of a tenement in advance of others, would be popularly\r\nconsidered _primâ facie_ evidence of ability to pay rates, the cottage\r\nspeculator would not be at the expense to present evidence against the\r\nexemption by which he would gain. The general tenor of the evidence is,\r\nthat the exempted tenements are of a very inferior order, and that the\r\nrents collected for them are exorbitant, and such as ought to ensure\r\ntenements of a higher quality.\r\n\r\nSuch residences appear to come in competition very rarely, and, viewed\r\nwith reference to the place of work, the habitations of the labouring\r\nclasses in the manufacturing towns extensively partake of the nature of\r\nmonopolies, and hence the landlord is enabled to exact a price for\r\nposition, independently of the character or quality of the building, or\r\nof the extent of outlay upon it. Where there is any choice, the\r\nlabouring classes are generally attracted to these tenements by the\r\npromise of exemption from the payment of poor’s rates, and are deluded\r\ninto the payment of a proportionately higher rent. (See the evidence on\r\nthis subject taken before the House of Commons’ Committee on the Rating\r\nof Cottage Tenements in 1838; Questions 1103; 1106; 1222; 1377; 1403;\r\n1504–7; 1637–8; 1594; 2269; 2271; 3124; 2234–5; 2240; 2279; 3106;\r\n3723–4; 3920; 4054; 4071.)\r\n\r\nThe depressing effect of such exemptions is illustrated by the effect of\r\ntheir withdrawal, in cases where the inmates were not only excused from\r\nthe payment of rates, but from the payment of rents, as in the instance\r\nof the parish cottages. The sales of cottage tenements held by the\r\nparish have formed a part of the business of this Commission since its\r\ncommencement. The effects of the removal of the exemption from the\r\npayment of rent consequent upon the sale are generally described as\r\nbeneficial. The tenor of the evidence on this subject is conveyed in a\r\ncommunication from the _Rev. Charles Turner_, the chairman of the\r\nTenbury union, quoted in Sir Edmund Head’s report:—\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Turner also says, ‘When the parish property has been sold, a vast\r\n  improvement in the external appearance of the cottages has taken\r\n  place, and consequently a higher rent is demanded, and frequently\r\n  obtained.’ We thus see one proof, among many, that the sales of parish\r\n  property which have taken place under the orders of the Commissioners\r\n  have been beneficial to the public at large; a vast mass of small\r\n  buildings (amounting, for instance, in the Bromyard union only, to no\r\n  less than the net worth of 3643_l._) has been withdrawn from a state\r\n  of dilapidation and decay and thrown into the market. Money has been\r\n  expended on it; it has been put into tenantable and proper repair, and\r\n  all parties have found their interest in the change. To the parish it\r\n  formerly yielded nothing. The pauper lived on in filth and\r\n  wretchedness, in a hovel of which he did not dare to complain, because\r\n  he held it by sufferance; and the community at large were deprived of\r\n  an opportunity for a profitable outlay of capital on tenements thus\r\n  kept in mortmain of the worst kind. Such an outlay would not have\r\n  taken place unless it promised a return, that is to say, unless the\r\n  class for whose reception the cottages are fitted could in all\r\n  probability pay for the improved accommodation. With regard to parties\r\n  living in their own houses, Mr. Turner says, ‘There are many poor\r\n  persons living in their own cottages, which are of a very inferior\r\n  description, wretchedly comfortless, and have only one floor. They are\r\n  decidedly worse than those which are rented, both as to accommodation\r\n  and state of repairs; but these, for the most part, have been built on\r\n  the waste and unenclosed land.’”\r\n\r\nThe mischievous effect of exemptions from rating on the ground of\r\npoverty, in bringing down buildings to the exempted scale, and in\r\npreventing advances beyond it, is strikingly displayed in Ireland, where\r\nall houses not exceeding the value of 5_l._ are exempted from\r\ncontribution to the county cess. The general consequence is that, the\r\nfarmers’ residences throughout the country are kept down to the level of\r\nmere cottages or inconvenient hovels, to avoid passing the line of\r\ncontribution, and only pass it by indulgent or evasive valuations. But\r\nthe supposed exemption (which, if it be not often made up by increased\r\nrent, is a circumstance peculiar to the smaller holdings in that\r\ncountry)—an exemption which no doubt was procured as a boon, was\r\nproductive of further ill effects to the parties intended to be\r\nbenefited.[38] Being kept by the immediate expense and the fear of their\r\nshare of the tax to thatched roofs, these thatched roofs afforded\r\nfacilities to incendiarism, since any one might put a cinder in the\r\nthatch, and run away without detection; hence it has placed the inmates\r\nso far under continued terror in disturbed times, that it would\r\nfrequently have been worth the expense of putting on a slate roof as a\r\nmeasure of preventive police. The depression of the tenement is\r\npractically a depression of the habits and condition of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nI may assume that it has been proved that the labouring classes do\r\npossess the means of purchasing the comforts of superior dwellings, and\r\nalso that they are not benefited by exemptions from the immediate\r\ncharges wherever requisite to defray the expense of those superior\r\ncomforts.\r\n\r\nI shall now show how little it is in the power of these classes\r\nvoluntarily to obtain these improvements,—setting aside entirely the\r\nconsideration of the obstacles arising from depraved habits already\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nThe workman’s “location,” as it is termed, is generally governed by his\r\nwork, near which he must reside. The sort of house, and often the\r\nparticular house, may be said to be, and usually is, a monopoly. On\r\narriving at manhood in a crowded neighbourhood, if he wishes to have a\r\nhouse, he must avail himself of the first vacancy that presents itself;\r\nif there happen to be more houses vacant than one, the houses being\r\nusually of the same class, little range of choice is thereby presented\r\nto him. In particular neighbourhoods near Manchester, and in other parts\r\nof the county of Lancaster, in some other manufacturing and in some\r\nrural districts, instances occur of the erection of improved ranges of\r\nlarger and better constructed houses for the labouring classes; and,\r\nmaking deduction for the occasional misuse of the increased space by\r\nsubdividing them and overcrowding them with lodgers, the extent to which\r\nthese improved tenements are sought, and the manner in which an improved\r\nrent is paid, afford gratifying evidence of an increasing disposition\r\nprevalent amongst artisans to avail themselves of such improvements.\r\nThese opportunities, however, are comparatively few, and occur in\r\ndistricts where multitudes continue in the most depressed condition,\r\napparently without any power of emerging from it.\r\n\r\nThe individual labourer has little or no power over the internal\r\nstructure and economy of the dwelling which has fallen to his lot. If\r\nthe water be not laid on in the other houses in the street, or if it be\r\nunprovided with proper receptacles for refuse, it is not in the power of\r\nany individual workman who may perceive the advantages of such\r\naccommodations to procure them. He has as little control over the\r\nexternal economy of his residence as of the structure of the street\r\nbefore it, whether it shall be paved or unpaved, drained, or undrained.\r\nIt may be said that he might cleanse the street before his own door. By\r\nsome local acts the obligation to do so is imposed on the individual\r\ninhabitants. By those inhabitants who have servants this duty may be and\r\nis performed, but the labourer has no servant; all of his family who are\r\ncapable of labour are out a-field, or in the manufactory or the\r\nworkshop, at daybreak, and return only at nightfall, and this regulation\r\ntherefore is unavoidably neglected.\r\n\r\nUnder the slavery of the existing habits of labourers, it is found that\r\nthe faculty of perceiving the advantage of a change is so obliterated as\r\nto render them incapable of using, or indifferent to the use of, the\r\nmeans of improvement which may happen to come within their reach. The\r\nsense of smell, for instance, which generally gives certain warning of\r\nthe presence of malaria or gases noxious to the health, appears often to\r\nbe obliterated in the labourer by his employment. He appears to be\r\ninsensible to anything but changes of temperature, and there is scarcely\r\nany stench which is not endured to avoid slight cold.\r\n\r\nIt would have been matter of sincere congratulation to have met with\r\nmore extensive evidence of spontaneous improvement amongst the classes\r\nin receipt, of high wages, but nearly all the beneficial changes found\r\nin progress throughout the country are changes that have arisen from the\r\nefforts of persons of the superior classes. Inquiries have been made for\r\nplans of improved tenements, but none have been found which can be\r\npresented as improvements originating with the class intended to be\r\naccommodated. In the rural districts, the worst of the new cottages are\r\nthose erected on the borders of commons by the labourers themselves. In\r\nthe manufacturing districts, the tenements erected by building clubs and\r\nby speculating builders of the class of workmen, are frequently the\r\nsubject of complaint, as being the least substantial and the most\r\ndestitute of proper accommodation. The only conspicuous instances of\r\nimproved residences of the labouring classes found in the rural\r\ndistricts are those which have been erected by opulent and benevolent\r\nlandlords for the accommodation of the labourers on their own estates;\r\nand in the manufacturing districts, those erected by wealthy\r\nmanufacturers for the accommodation of their own workpeople.\r\n\r\nAs in England so in Scotland, the most important improvements have been\r\neffected through enlightened landlords. The members of the Highland\r\nSociety, who have made the best exertions for improving the condition of\r\nthe labouring population in the rural districts, and have offered prizes\r\nfor the best-constructed cottages and the best plans, competition being\r\nopen to all parties, got nothing from the lower classes, and only\r\nsucceeded in exciting the interest of the most intelligent proprietors,\r\nand getting improvements effected through their exertions. Mr. Loudon,\r\nin an appeal on behalf of the agricultural labourers, lays it down as a\r\nprimary position that, “In general, proprietors ought not to entrust the\r\nerection of labourers’ cottages on their estates to the farmers, as it\r\nis chiefly owing to this practice that so many wretched hovels exist in\r\nthe best cultivated districts of Scotland and Northumberland.”\r\n\r\n\r\n _Employers’ influence on the Health of Workpeople by means of improved\r\n                             Habitations._\r\n\r\nPreparatory to the exposition of the means of protection of the public\r\nhealth provided by the existing law, and of the modifications that\r\nappear to be requisite for the attainment of the object in question, I\r\nwould submit for consideration practical examples of its partial\r\nattainment by means of improved dwellings; combined with examples of\r\nother improvements effected in the moral condition of the labouring\r\nclasses, by the judicious exercise of the influence possessed by their\r\nsuperiors in condition.\r\n\r\nThroughout the country examples are found of a desire, on the part of\r\npersons of the higher class, to improve the condition of the poorer\r\nclasses by the erection of dwellings of a superior order for their\r\naccommodation. These, however, are generally at a cost beyond any return\r\nto be expected in the present state of the habits of the people in the\r\nshape of rent, or any return in money for an outlay on an ordinary\r\ninvestment of capital. But the instances about to be noticed, though\r\ngenerally originating in benevolence, and without the expectation of a\r\nreturn, do, in the results, prove that in money and money’s worth, the\r\nerection of good tenements affords the inducement of a fair remuneration\r\nto the employers of labour to provide improved accommodation for their\r\nown labourers.\r\n\r\nWherever it has been brought under observation, the connexion of the\r\nlabourer’s residence with his employment as part of the farm, or of the\r\nestate, or of the manufactory on which he is employed, and as part of\r\nthe inducement to service, appears to be mutually advantageous to the\r\nemployer and the employed. The first advantages are to the person\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nWe everywhere find (in contradiction to statements frequently made in\r\npopular declamations) that the labourer gains by his connexion with\r\nlarge capital: in the instances presented in the course of this inquiry,\r\nof residences held from the employer, we find that the labourer gains by\r\nthe expenditure for the external appearance of that which is known to be\r\npart of the property,—an expenditure that is generally accompanied by\r\ncorresponding internal comforts; he gains by all the surrounding\r\nadvantages of good roads and drainage, and by more sustained and\r\npowerful care to maintain them; he gains by the closer proximity to his\r\nwork attendant on such an arrangement, and he thus avoids all the\r\nattacks of disease, occasioned by exposure to wet and cold, and the\r\nadditional fatigue in traversing long distances to and from his home to\r\nthe place of work, in the damp of early morning or of nightfall. The\r\nexposure to weather, after leaving the place of work, is one prolific\r\ncause of disease, especially to the young. When the home is near to the\r\nplace of work, the labourer is enabled to take his dinner with his\r\nfamily instead of at the beer-shop.\r\n\r\nThe wife and family generally gain, by proximity to the employer or the\r\nemployer’s family, in motives to neatness and cleanliness by their being\r\nknown and being under observation; as a general rule, the whole economy\r\nof the cottages in bye-lanes and out-of-the-way places appears to be\r\nbelow those exposed to observation. In connexion with property or large\r\ncapital, the labourer gains in the stability of employment, and the\r\nregularity of income incidental to operations on a large scale; there is\r\na mutual benefit also in the wages for service being given in the shape\r\nof buildings or permanent and assured comforts; that is, in what would\r\nbe the best application of wages, rather than wholly in money wages.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacturing districts there is a mutual and large gain by the\r\ndiminution of the labour of the collection of rents, the avoidance of\r\nthe risks of non-payment, and also in the power of control for the\r\nprevention of disturbances, and the removal of tenants of bad character\r\nand conduct.\r\n\r\nSurprise is frequently expressed at the enormous rents ranging up to and\r\nbeyond 20 per cent. on the outlay, exacted by the building speculators\r\nin the towns. But when the experience of these descriptions of tenements\r\nis examined, it is found that the labour of collecting the rents, and\r\nthe labour of protecting the property itself against waste from\r\nunprincipled tenants, is such as to prove that accommodation given to\r\nthe disorderly and vicious is scarcely remunerative at any price. The\r\ntenants are loosely attached, and large numbers migratory, partly from\r\nthe nature of their work; and having little or no goods or furniture,\r\nthey have no obstacles to removal; they frequently, before absconding,\r\ncommit every description of waste; they often burn shelves and\r\ncupboard-doors, and the door itself, and all timber that can be got at\r\nfor the purpose.[39] An objection frequently made against laying on the\r\nwater in houses inhabited by a population addicted to drinking is, that\r\nthey would sell the receptacles and destroy the pipe, and let the water\r\nrun to waste, for the sake of the lead. The expense and delay of legal\r\nremedies precludes redress for such injuries.\r\n\r\nIn some of the worst neighbourhoods in Manchester, the whole population\r\nof a street have risen to resist the service of legal process by the\r\ncivil officers. In the course of the Constabulary Inquiry I was informed\r\nby the superintendent of the old police of that town, that one of the\r\nmost dangerous services for a small force was attending to enforce\r\nejectments. This they had often to do, cutlass in hand, and were\r\nfrequently driven off by showers of bricks from the mobs. The collection\r\nof the rents weekly in such neighbourhoods is always a disagreeable\r\nservice, requiring high payment. This, and the frequent running away of\r\nthe tenant, and the waste, greatly reduce the apparently enormous rent\r\nobtainable from this poorer class of tenants. For all these vices,\r\nrisks, and defaults of others, the frugal and well-conducted workman who\r\nhas no choice of habitation, is compelled to pay in the shape of an\r\nincreased rent; he is most largely taxed in the increased rent,\r\nnecessary as an insurance for the risks and losses occasioned by the\r\ndefective state of legal remedies.\r\n\r\nAll these risks the employer is enabled to diminish or avoid, by\r\nselecting his own tenants, and he has the best means of doing so; by\r\nreservations of rent on the payment of wages, he saves the labour and\r\nrisks of collection; nor will the vicious workman so readily commit\r\nwaste in the house belonging to his employer as in one belonging to a\r\npoorer and unconnected owner. The employer has, moreover, the most\r\ndirect interest in the health and strength of his workpeople.\r\n\r\nIt is not supposed that these are arrangements which can be universal,\r\nor readily made the subject of legislation. At the commencement of some\r\nmanufactures, the additional outlay may not be practicable. But those\r\nmanufactures have generally had the greatest success where good\r\naccommodation for the workpeople was comprehended in the first\r\narrangements. When, however, a manufactory has been once established and\r\nbrought into systematic operation, when the first uncertainties have\r\nbeen overcome and the employer has time to look about him, there appears\r\nto be no position from which so extensive and certain a beneficial\r\ninfluence may be exercised as that of the capitalist who stands in the\r\ndouble relation of landlord and employer. He will find that whilst an\r\nunhealthy and vicious population is an expensive as well as a dangerous\r\none, all improvements in the condition of the population have their\r\ncompensation. In one instance, of a large outlay on improved tenements,\r\nand in provision for the moral improvement of the rising generation of\r\nworkpeople, by an expensive provision for schools, the proprietor\r\nacknowledged to me that although he made the improvements from motives\r\nof a desire to improve the condition of his workpeople, or what might be\r\ntermed the satisfaction derived from the improvements as a “hobby,” he\r\nwas surprised by a pecuniary gain found in the superior order and\r\nefficiency of his establishment, in the regularity and trustworthiness\r\nof his workpeople, which gave even pecuniary compensation for the outlay\r\nof capital and labour bestowed upon them. He stated that he would not,\r\nfor 7000_l._, change the entire set of workpeople on whom care had been\r\nbestowed for the promiscuous assemblage of workpeople engaged in the\r\nsame description of manufactures.\r\n\r\nI would now submit for consideration, with the view to promulgation for\r\nvoluntary adoption, instances of the arrangements which have been found\r\nmost beneficial in their operation on the condition of the manufacturing\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent of these instances was pointed out to our attention\r\nin the course of the Factory Inquiry, in the habitations connected with\r\nthe mills superintended by the late Mr. Archibald Buchanan, at Catrine,\r\nin Ayrshire. Nearly 1000 persons are employed in these mills, the places\r\nof work are well ventilated and carefully kept; the village where the\r\nworkpeople live is advantageously situated, and the houses are well\r\nbuilt. They are thus described by his son in answer to my inquiries:—\r\n\r\n  “The system that has been pursued here, and which was adopted by my\r\n  father for the purpose of giving the workers a greater interest in the\r\n  place, at the same time that it gave them an object to be careful and\r\n  saving, while it raised them in point of standing and respectability,\r\n  has been different from that generally acted upon at country works.\r\n  Instead of our company continuing the proprietors of the\r\n  dwelling-houses and letting them to the workpeople, my father gave the\r\n  workers every encouragement to save money, so that they might\r\n  themselves become the proprietors of a house and small garden, either\r\n  by making a purchase from the company or fencing ground and building a\r\n  house for themselves. This plan has been very successful, and many of\r\n  our people are proprietors of excellent houses with gardens attached,\r\n  which afford them employment and amusement in their spare hours; and\r\n  among themselves they have a horticultural society and an annual\r\n  competition. Though many houses have been sold in this way, a\r\n  considerable part of the village is still the property of our company,\r\n  and those that have been built by other parties are in accordance with\r\n  a plan of streets laid down; and I should say are about equal to the\r\n  others in comfort and conveniences, it being the interest of the\r\n  person investing his money to get the best return he can for it; and\r\n  that he may get his house let and a fair rent for it, he must build as\r\n  good a house as the tenant can get for the same rent from another. The\r\n  houses are substantially built of stone and lime, and slated, and are\r\n  generally of two stories, containing four families, occupying two\r\n  rooms each. They have generally small plots of garden-ground behind,\r\n  in which are dungsteads and necessaries, with a space between them and\r\n  the houses. The village is well supplied with water by spring-wells\r\n  and pumps in various parts of it; and some of the streets have water\r\n  conveyed to them in pipes from the aqueduct to the water-wheels that\r\n  give motion to the works. I cannot, however, very well give any\r\n  distinct plan or drawing of the dwellings of the workpeople, our\r\n  houses being a good deal mixed with those belonging to others.\r\n\r\n  “The population of the village, per census taken 30th December last,\r\n  is 2699, and the number of families 566, so that the proportion of\r\n  individuals to each family is 4‑435/566, and the number employed in\r\n  the works is 936. The proprietors of houses appoint annually a\r\n  committee of their number to attend to the repairs of the streets, and\r\n  the keeping of them clean; and they have a man constantly in their\r\n  employment for this purpose, the expense being defrayed by the feuers\r\n  assessing themselves according to the rental of their properties.”\r\n\r\nThese mills were pointed out to our attention during the Factory\r\nInquiry, by Mr. Stuart, the commissioner, who observed that the\r\nworkpeople, “more especially the females, are not only apparently in the\r\npossession of good health, but many of them (quite as large a proportion\r\nas we have seen in any of the extensive well-regulated similar\r\nestablishments in country districts) are blooming—as unlike as possible\r\nto the pale, languid-looking females too frequently to be found in\r\nsimilar works in great cities.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Hill_, the prison inspector for Scotland, stated that the\r\nprocurator fiscal, or public prosecutor, reported to him that he had\r\nnothing to do in that village; and in his Third Report he thus mentions\r\nit:—\r\n\r\n  “There is little crime here, and very few offences of any kind, and it\r\n  is reported that there is not a single person in the village who is of\r\n  a bad character. Indeed no person of bad character, or who is in the\r\n  habit of drunkenness, is allowed to remain in the mills, on which\r\n  nearly the whole population of the village is directly or indirectly\r\n  dependent. The few offences which are committed are almost all by\r\n  vagrants. The inhabitants of Catrine appear to be in the enjoyment of\r\n  an unusual amount of comfort; they are well clad, live in neat houses,\r\n  many of them their own property, and look healthy and cheerful; indeed\r\n  the only person in the village who has reason to be downcast is the\r\n  medical man, who complains that he has nothing to do.”\r\n\r\nSimilar effects are manifested in the mills at New Lanark, at the\r\nflax-mills near Cupar. These instances would suffice to establish the\r\nfact of the very little sickness that is _essential_ to the occupation\r\nitself. _Mr. Hill_ who, by his office, is led to appreciate highly\r\ninstances of exemption from crime and disorder, exclaims, upon the sight\r\nof such establishments,—“Notwithstanding what has been said on the\r\nsubject of factories, I have no hesitation in declaring that I believe\r\nthat the workpeople at Catrine, New Lanark, and other similar\r\nestablishments, form some of the healthiest, happiest, and most moral\r\ncommunities in the world.”\r\n\r\nFrom other examples it appears to be by no means essential to such\r\nimprovements that the labourers should become proprietors of their\r\noccupations. _Mr. Buchanan, jun._, expresses his concurrence in the\r\ngeneral conclusions to which I have arrived of the advantages derived by\r\nthe labourer from his connexion with his place of work, and says,—\r\n\r\n  “I perfectly agree that a labouring man will generally be found in a\r\n  state of greater comfort, holding a tenement from his employer, than\r\n  when left to provide a dwelling of whatever kind he chooses for\r\n  himself. In our case the proprietors, in the first place, furnished\r\n  the house, in which the workmen formed habits of cleanliness and\r\n  comfort, and when by care and economy he had saved as much as enabled\r\n  him to purchase it, he was advanced a step higher by becoming himself\r\n  the proprietor, continuing to occupy part of the house himself, and\r\n  letting the other parts to his fellow-workmen.\r\n\r\n  “I believe that our people enjoy as good health, and have as many\r\n  comforts as any of the same class either in the same or any other\r\n  employment, as their appearance will testify; and the generally\r\n  different appearance of the manufacturing population in towns is to be\r\n  attributed to the habits of the people themselves, and the way in\r\n  which they are crowded together, and not to anything in the nature of\r\n  the employment.”[40]\r\n\r\nThe following account which I have received in answer to inquiries from\r\n_Mr. Henry Ashworth_, of Turton, near Bolton, with relation to the\r\nmanufacturing population of that place, is so far characteristic of the\r\nprogress of a population of more extensive districts, and of the means\r\nof their improvement, that I submit it at full length:—\r\n\r\n  “On the early introduction of the cotton manufacture, the parties who\r\n  entered into it were men of limited capital, and anxious to invest the\r\n  whole of it in mills and machinery, and therefore too much absorbed\r\n  with the doubtful success of their own affairs to look after the\r\n  necessities of their workpeople.\r\n\r\n  “Families were attracted from all parts for the benefit of employment,\r\n  and obliged, as a temporary resort, to crowd together into such\r\n  dwellings as the neighbourhood afforded: often two families into one\r\n  house; others into cellars or very small dwellings: eventually, as the\r\n  works became established, either the proprietor or some neighbour\r\n  would probably see it advantageous to build a few cottages; these were\r\n  often of the worst description; in such case the prevailing\r\n  consideration was not how to promote the health and comfort of the\r\n  occupants, but how many cottages could be built upon the smallest\r\n  space of ground and at the least possible cost. We find many built\r\n  back to back, a most objectionable form, as precluding the possibility\r\n  of any outlet behind.\r\n\r\n  “People brought together as these were for a living, had no\r\n  alternative but to occupy such dwellings. Whatever the weekly income,\r\n  the wife could never make such a house comfortable; she had only one\r\n  room in which to do all her work; it may be readily supposed the\r\n  husband would not always find the comfort he wished in such a home.\r\n  The public-house would then be his only resort. But here the evil does\r\n  not end; the children brought up in such dwellings knew no better\r\n  accommodation than such afforded, nor had they any opportunities of\r\n  seeing better domestic management. Few of the parents in these parts\r\n  have ever lived as domestic servants, so that it becomes no matter of\r\n  surprise that the major part should have so little knowledge of\r\n  improving their social condition even when the pecuniary means are\r\n  within their reach. It must be allowed that the introduction of\r\n  manufactures is not justly chargeable with producing the whole of this\r\n  evil. About this time the old Poor Law was exercising a very\r\n  pernicious influence upon the labouring classes, by means of inducing\r\n  both the landowners and farmers to discourage cottage property for\r\n  fear the inmates should gain parish settlements.\r\n\r\n  “Cottages were forbidden to be built; some pulled down when empty, and\r\n  others fell to decay for want of repair; poor people were banished as\r\n  much as possible from the agricultural districts on account of the\r\n  burden of parish settlements; even in this county I saw the ruins of\r\n  two cottages, which I was informed were the two last cottages in the\r\n  parish.\r\n\r\n  “Under such depressing causes it is not to be wondered at that we\r\n  frequently received families into our employ who did not know how to\r\n  conduct (with propriety) a decent cottage in such a manner as to\r\n  conduce either to the health or comfort of the inmates.\r\n\r\n  “About twelve years ago we had occasion to introduce a considerable\r\n  number of families into some new houses; in the course of a few months\r\n  a most malignant fever broke out amongst them, and went from house to\r\n  house, till we became seriously alarmed for the safety of the whole\r\n  establishment. We instituted an inquiry into the state of the houses\r\n  where the fever first appeared, and found that from the low habits of\r\n  the occupants, and the ignorance of the proper decencies of life, the\r\n  cottages were in so filthy a state that it was apparent we should not\r\n  long be free from a recurrence of the same evil unless we took some\r\n  active means to effect a change in the habits of these people.\r\n\r\n  “Although we felt very unwilling to do anything which appeared to\r\n  interfere with the domestic management of our workpeople, still the\r\n  urgency of the case at the time seemed to warrant such a step. We\r\n  therefore ordered an examination of every cottage in our possession,\r\n  both as regarded cleanliness and ventilation, as well as bedding and\r\n  furniture.\r\n\r\n  “The striking difference exhibited in the state of these cottages, the\r\n  neatness and cleanness of some, the gross neglect of others, appearing\r\n  to have no relation to the amount of income, convinced us that an\r\n  occasional repetition of these visits would be essential in order to\r\n  effect any permanent improvement amongst them.\r\n\r\n  “These periodical visits have now been continued through a series of\r\n  years; and as no invidious distinction or selection was ever made, do\r\n  not appear to have been viewed in the light of an intrusion; a week or\r\n  two of notice being mostly given, a laudable degree of emulation has\r\n  been excited as to whose house bedding and furniture should be found\r\n  in the best order; my brother or myself have occasionally joined in\r\n  these visits. By these means we were made acquainted with the wants\r\n  and necessities of the various families in our employ. Having had such\r\n  opportunity of observing the great inconvenience arising from small\r\n  dwellings where the families were large, both as regards bed-rooms and\r\n  living-rooms, few cottages having more than two bed-rooms; and where\r\n  there were children or young persons of both sexes, the indelicacy of\r\n  this arrangement was apparent; we therefore concluded to build larger\r\n  cottages, and make them with three bed-rooms in each. These houses\r\n  were sought after with the greatest avidity, and families allowed to\r\n  remove to them as an especial favour; the increase rent of 1_s._ to\r\n  1_s._ 6_d._ per week was a small consideration in regard to the\r\n  additional comfort afforded to a family where the income was from\r\n  24_s._ to 50_s._ or 60_s._ per week, as is frequently the case with\r\n  families employed in manufactories.”\r\n\r\nBut I am enabled to adduce evidence showing that by structural\r\nimprovements of the places of work as well as of abode which present the\r\nbounty on and security for future adoption, constituted by experience of\r\npecuniary saving, the health of the manufacturing workpeople, now\r\namongst the lowest, may be advanced to the average of health enjoyed by\r\nany other class.\r\n\r\nOn my return from Glasgow, I proceeded to visit and examine the cotton\r\nmanufactory and machine-making works erected and carried on under the\r\ndirections of Mr. James Smith, of Deanston, near Stirling, the inventor\r\nof the subsoil plough, to whose valuable opinion on the subject of\r\ndrainage I have already made reference.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the improvement of places of work, which constituted\r\nthe chief object of attention at Deanston, was the erection of\r\nmanufactories in one large flat or ground floor, instead of story piled\r\nupon story as in the old mode.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith had constructed a new department of the cottonmill in one room\r\nor flat, which covered about half an acre of ground. The roof was\r\ncomposed of groined arches in divisional squares of 33 feet 6 inches,\r\nsupported on cast-iron columns, which were hollow, and through which the\r\ndrainage of the roof was effected. In order to render the roof of the\r\nbuilding water-tight, the outer superficies of the arches were covered\r\nwith a coat of common plaster, over which, when dried, was laid a\r\ncoating of coal-tar, boiled to a pitchy consistence, and mixed with\r\nsand, laid on to a thickness of three-quarters of an inch. Over this was\r\nlaid a surface of from 12 to 16 inches of garden-soil, which prevents\r\nthe injurious effects on the pitch of the frost in winter, and the sun\r\nin summer.\r\n\r\nThe height of this large room was 12 feet from the floor to the spring\r\nof the arches, and six feet rise, giving a height to the room in which\r\nthe operatives were engaged of 18 feet. The height of the ordinary rooms\r\nin which the workpeople in manufactories are engaged is not more than\r\nfrom 9 to 11 feet. This restricted space arises from various points of\r\neconomy (now considered to be mistaken) in the old modes of constructing\r\nmanufactories, which were first erected in towns where land was dear,\r\nand in times when the immediate economy of capital was of more pressing\r\nimportance. The adverse consequences to the operatives are the\r\nrestriction of space for air; that the heat and effluvia of the lower\r\nrooms are communicated to the rooms above; and that the difficulty of\r\nventilating them is exceedingly great, especially in the wide rooms,\r\nwhere it is found to be practically extremely difficult to get a current\r\nof fresh air to pass through the centre. The like difficulties have been\r\nheretofore experienced in respect to the ventilation of large ships.\r\nThere is also in the mills of the old construction the additional\r\nfatigue of ascending and descending to the higher rooms, and carrying\r\nmaterial. To avoid this, in some instances, machinery is resorted to.\r\n\r\nThe ventilation through the side windows of large rooms is generally\r\nfound to be imperfect and inconvenient in many of the processes, and\r\nannoying to the workpeople from the influx of the air in strong\r\ncurrents. The arrangements for ventilation through the roof of this room\r\nappeared to be highly advantageous. The light was brought in from above,\r\nthrough openings eight feet in diameter at the top of each groin,\r\nsurmounted by domes or cones of glass, at the apex of which there were\r\nopenings of about 16 inches in diameter, with covers that could be\r\nopened or shut at pleasure, to admit of ventilation. The better\r\ndistribution of the light for the work from these openings was one\r\nadvantage they appeared to possess over the ordinary mode of getting\r\nlight from side windows.\r\n\r\nThe chief arrangements from below for ventilation were made by tunnels\r\n10 feet distance from each other, carried across and underneath the\r\nfloor of the building, and terminating in the open air on either side.\r\nThe covers of these tunnels were perforated with holes of about an inch\r\nin diameter and 12 inches apart, disposed through the floor so as to\r\noccasion a wide and uniform distribution of fresh air throughout the\r\nwhole building, on the same principle as that adopted for the admission\r\nof fresh air through the floor of the House of Commons. In winter time\r\nthe fresh air admitted was warmed on the same principle, by pipes of hot\r\nwater, to prevent the inconvenience of the admission of currents of cold\r\nair. The whole building was, from its size and arrangements, kept at a\r\nsteady temperature, and appeared to be less susceptible than other\r\nbuildings to atmospheric influence. The shaftings for the conveyance of\r\nthe power were carried through the tunnels, and straps or belts from the\r\nshafts rise through the cover of the tunnels, and, by their motion, aid\r\nin promoting the circulation of the air. The possibility of fatal\r\naccidents from the persons being caught by the straps and wound round\r\nthe shafts, was by this arrangement entirely prevented. The tunnelling\r\nunder this arrangement constituted a boxing off of the whole of the\r\nshafting. Another advantage from the removal of the driving-straps from\r\nabove was that the view over the whole room was entirely unimpeded.\r\n\r\nAnother structural improvement was in the use of a thin flooring of wood\r\nover the solid base of stone floors. The floor so arranged affords the\r\nsolidity of the stone floor, and inconsiderable danger of combustion,\r\nwhilst the advantages of the wooden surface to the workers were a\r\ndiminution of swelled ancles and rheumatic affections of the joints,\r\noften produced by working bare-footed on stone floors.\r\n\r\nThere were no entries made from which I could obtain for comparison an\r\naccount of the amount of sickness experienced by the workpeople in this\r\nnew room, but it was obvious that the improvement must be considerable,\r\nand it was attested by the rosy and fresh countenances of the females\r\nand of the workpeople generally. A considerable improvement was manifest\r\nin the health of those workpeople who had previously worked in the older\r\nand less spacious rooms.\r\n\r\nThe improvement of the place of work was combined with improvements in\r\nthe residences of the workpeople. About one-half of the hands employed\r\nin the mills resided in houses near the works, which were well drained;\r\nthe ashes and other refuse was cleared away from the village every\r\nmorning between six and seven o’clock, and carried to a general\r\ndungstead at a distance, for use on their gardens. On inquiry as to the\r\nstate of the health of the workpeople living in these improved\r\ntenements, it appeared that they had not one-half the amount of sickness\r\nexperienced by the rest of the workpeople who lived in the common\r\nill-regulated houses about a mile distance. The whole population had\r\nfewer diseases than any other class of the population in the surrounding\r\ncountry; they presented fewer cases of rheumatism, and there were\r\nscarcely any lung diseases amongst them: their general health was\r\ndecidedly better than that of the adjacent agricultural population.\r\n\r\nThe chief advantages of the improved arrangements of the places of work\r\nwere, on the side of the workpeople, improved health; security for\r\nfemales and for the young against the dangers of fatal accidents, and\r\nless fatigue in the execution of the same amount of work. But beyond\r\nthese the arrangement of the work in one room had moral advantages of\r\nhigh value. The bad manners and immoralities complained of as attendant\r\non assemblages of workpeople of both sexes in manufactories, generally\r\noccur, as may be expected, in small rooms and places where few are\r\nemployed, and that are secluded from superior inspection and from common\r\nobservation. But whilst employed in this one large room, the young are\r\nunder the inspection of the old; the children are in many instances\r\nunder the inspection of parents, and all under the observation of the\r\nwhole body of workers, and under the inspection of the employer. It was\r\nobserved that the moral condition of the females in this room stood\r\ncomparatively high. It would scarcely be practicable to discriminate the\r\nmoral effects arising from one cause where several are in operation; but\r\nit was stated by ministers that there were fewer cases of illegitimacy\r\nand less vice observable among the population engaged in this\r\nmanufactory than amongst the surrounding population of the labouring\r\nclass. The comparative circumstances of that population were such as,\r\nwhen examined, would establish the conclusion that it must be so.\r\n\r\nThe first expense of such a building is higher than a manufactory of the\r\nold construction; but it appeared to possess countervailing economical\r\nadvantages to the capitalist, the chief of which are,—this same facility\r\nof constant general supervision, the increase of the certainty of\r\nsuperintendence, and the reduction of the numbers of subordinate\r\nmanagers, the increase of efficiency of management, and a diminution of\r\nits expense. Another advantage arose to the manufacturer in the superior\r\naction of the machinery. In mills of the ordinary construction the\r\nmachinery is frequently deranged in its structure, and put out of order\r\nby the yielding and unsteadiness of the upper floors. The machinery\r\nerected on the ground floor has a firm basis, and a steady and more\r\ndurable action. The other advantages presented were, the saving of\r\nlabour in transporting the material from one process to another, a\r\nlabour which is often considerable in expense, as well as in\r\ninconvenience, in lifting it into the higher rooms; the reduction of the\r\nhazard of fire, and consequently in expense of insurance against it, as\r\nfire could scarcely take place, and certainly could not rapidly extend\r\nin a manufactory so constructed. These several sources of economy Mr.\r\nSmith calculated would more than compensate for any increase of\r\nground-rent, even if the building were erected on land costing 1000_l._\r\nper acre. Mr. Marshall, of Leeds, on consulting with Mr. Smith, has\r\nconstructed a new manufactory (on the principle of that in Deanston) in\r\nLeeds, where ground is valuable. This manufactory covers more than two\r\nacres of ground, and is reported to be eminently successful. Power looms\r\nare frequently arranged in buildings of one story, and I was informed of\r\nanother manufactory in Lancashire, nearly as large as that of Messrs.\r\nMarshalls, built on one floor, but it did not appear to possess the\r\narrangements for ventilation and warming, and the other arrangements\r\nnecessary to the complete action of a place of work on the plan of that\r\nat Deanston.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith considered that the principle of arrangement for superior\r\ninspection and management of a manufactory was equally applicable to\r\nagricultural operations, and that it would be proportionately\r\nadvantageous in the superior ventilation and equality of temperature for\r\ncattle, in the avoidance of labour and wet and cold, in removing from\r\none small separate building to another, and in the transport of produce,\r\nto have all under one large roof, where the whole direction and\r\ninspection of the homestead farming operations are brought under one\r\nview.\r\n\r\nOf the manufacturing advantages of such arrangements I have had strong\r\ntestimony: of the advantages of such arrangements to the health and\r\nmoral and social condition of the workpeople, I could not entertain the\r\nslightest doubt. I feel confident that the more closely it is examined,\r\nthe more clearly will the coincidence which I have endeavoured to trace,\r\nof pecuniary interest with the health and the highest physical and moral\r\nimprovement of the lowest of the labouring classes, be established. Mr.\r\nSmith avowed his confidence in this coincidence from his own experience\r\nand observation as a practical principle. The improved health of the\r\nworkpeople was attended by more energy and better labour; by less of\r\nlassitude and waste from relaxed attention; by fewer interruptions from\r\nsickness, and fewer spare hands to ensure the completion of work. Under\r\nthe persuasion of the coincidence of interest, he had endeavoured to\r\ndirect the structural alterations to the promotion of the health of the\r\nworkpeople; he believed they might be advantageously carried further,\r\nand had it in contemplation to make arrangements to promote habitual\r\nbathing amongst them. He had, moreover, retained the services of a\r\nmedical gentleman to inspect the workpeople from time to time, and give\r\nthem timely advice, and, as far as possible, to prevent disease. He\r\nagreed, and had long considered, that it was in the power of the masters\r\nof Britain “entirely to extirpate excessive and habitual drinking. We\r\nnever,” said he, “permit a man to come near the works who is in the\r\nslightest degree intoxicated, and never permit any one to be absent one\r\nday drinking. You never can be well or cheaply served by a dissipated\r\nworkman. The most skilful workman, the man whose services I can the\r\nleast spare, must, if he takes to drinking, leave the place. It may\r\noccasion immediate inconvenience and even immediate loss, but if the\r\nrule be steadily applied, it will contribute to the comfort and the\r\nprofit of the master as well as of the man.”\r\n\r\nThe importance of such beneficent influence on the health, the moral\r\ncondition and respectability of the labouring classes, is so little\r\nunderstood, that I beg leave to submit further illustrations of the\r\nvalue of—\r\n\r\n\r\n _The Employers’ Influence on the Sobriety and Health of Workpeople by\r\n  modes of Payment which do not lead to Temptations to Intemperance._\r\n\r\nThe power possessed by extensive employers of labour to influence\r\nbeneficially their labourers, is not however confined to those who stand\r\nin the combined relation of employer and landlord. In the course of\r\nanother inquiry as to the means of preventing crime, it appeared that a\r\nlarge class of crimes and disorders arose from drunkenness. On carrying\r\nthe inquiry back into the causes out of which the drunkenness arose,\r\nthey appeared to be extensively removable, and that by the employers of\r\nlabour. The important influences that belong to this position will be\r\ndisplayed in the effects of alterations in detail in one point of\r\nmanagement, namely, the mode of paying wages. The direct sanitary\r\neffects may be best displayed in the following evidence of _Mr. Lomax_,\r\nan army pensioner, which has been corroborated by superior officers:—\r\n\r\n  “When I was in the Life Guards, 14 or 16 years ago, there was a good\r\n  deal of ill health prevalent amongst them. Before that time the men\r\n  received part of their pay weekly, namely, 7_s._ at the end of the\r\n  week. With this 7_s._ they had to provide the food which they\r\n  required, except their dinner. The ration for dinner was\r\n  three-quarters of a pound of uncooked meat, a pound of potatoes or\r\n  vegetables, and a pound of bread. It was found, however, that many of\r\n  the men spent the whole of the 7_s._ in a single day in drink or\r\n  dissipation. During the remainder of the week the men would be on what\r\n  was called the _crib-bite_, that is, living only on their dinner\r\n  rations. I knew many of the men who drooped under this system, partly\r\n  from the excess of drinking or dissipation, and partly from the\r\n  privation of the necessaries of life and the work they had to undergo.\r\n  This, again, led them to much temptation. If anything was lost it was\r\n  amongst this class of men that we looked for it. The crime-book would\r\n  speak as to the further bad consequences of these habits.\r\n\r\n  “The plan was then tried of paying the men 1_s._ each day. Over and\r\n  above that the men were provided with coffee. It was universally felt\r\n  that this change was highly beneficial to their health, and it stopped\r\n  the dissipation, and the consequences of the dissipation.”\r\n\r\nThe incapacity to apportion their means for temperate consumption (which\r\nis not however confined to the working classes) is extensively shown in\r\nthe mismanagement of the means for procuring food. It is a subject of\r\ncomplaint which frequently appears in the reports, that the ignorance of\r\ndomestic economy leads to ill health, by the purchase of unsuitable, and\r\nat the same time, expensive food. We have been frequently besought to\r\nobtain and promulgate, for popular information, instructions in frugal\r\ncookery, and the management of supplies. It is observed by _Mr.\r\nBrebner_, the governor of the Glasgow bridewell, where the cost of\r\nmaintaining the prisoners in health and increased strength is on average\r\nonly 2¾_d._ per diem, that\r\n\r\n  “The regularity of diet in the prisons here is of vast importance,\r\n  both as to the quantity and the time of serving it up. If the same\r\n  persons were to get the same amount of food for a whole week, or for a\r\n  less time, at their own discretion, they would suffer from surfeit at\r\n  one time, and from long fasting at another. Irregularity of diet is\r\n  one of the most fruitful sources of disease that occur in civilized\r\n  life.”\r\n\r\nIn further illustration of the beneficial influence which employers may\r\noften exercise to assail such vices by regulations in detail, I cite the\r\nfollowing instances from a communication I have received from _Mr. Edwin\r\nHill_, the inspector of stamping machinery for the Government:—\r\n\r\n  “During a period of nine years (from 1818 to 1827) I was engaged in\r\n  the superintendence of one of the largest works in the town of\r\n  Birmingham, consisting of two distinct mills, one employed in rolling\r\n  copper for the use of braziers and shipwrights, and the other in\r\n  rolling silver, brass, and other metals. In each mill there was a set\r\n  of skilled workmen, who undertook the work at fixed prices, and who\r\n  themselves employed numerous assistants at weekly wages.\r\n\r\n  “Owing to difficulties in the way of making up the accounts at short\r\n  intervals, it was the custom for the master to advance weekly to each\r\n  workman in the silver mill a fixed sum of money (besides advancing a\r\n  sum to pay the assistants with). The accounts were made up annually,\r\n  and the balances due to the several workmen then paid. The payments,\r\n  both weekly and annually, were almost always made not to the men but\r\n  to their wives. The earnings of the men were considerable, varying\r\n  from 80_l._ to 180_l._ a-year. The men were, almost without exception,\r\n  highly respectable in their stations, their families were well\r\n  provided for, their homes cleanly and not without pretensions to some\r\n  degree of elegance, and their children sent to school at the sole\r\n  expense of the parents. Some of them had made considerable\r\n  accumulations of money, and even become proprietors of houses and\r\n  land. The workmen employed in the copper mill, on the contrary, had\r\n  been accustomed to receive the full amount of their earnings at the\r\n  end of each week, and, after paying their assistants, to divide the\r\n  surplus. These men were much addicted to drinking and feasting at the\r\n  alehouse; and, although their earnings were nearly as great as those\r\n  of the other men, their families were in wretchedness, and their wives\r\n  obliged to eke out a slender pittance by washing and other laborious\r\n  occupations. There were also several men employed as millwrights and\r\n  engineers, at regular and good weekly wages. These men were, almost\r\n  without exception, steady and respectable, and their families well\r\n  provided for. About the year 1822 the inconvenience and annoyance, and\r\n  loss, which arose from the unsteady habits of the second set of men,\r\n  led me to inquire into the causes of their inferiority to the others,\r\n  and I was soon led to attribute much of the evil to the great\r\n  irregularity in the amount of their weekly incomes, which varied from\r\n  about 10_s._ to 4_l._ 4_s._ per man.\r\n\r\n  “The effects were as follows:—The men were reckless, trusting to their\r\n  luck to get ‘good work,’ _i. e._, that which bears a high price in\r\n  proportion to the required labour. They were enabled to deceive their\r\n  wives as to the amount of money obtained. They learned the minimum\r\n  with which their wives could contrive to keep house, and, having\r\n  learned it, they endeavoured to retain all above this minimum for\r\n  their own gratifications. Their wives, under the pressure of\r\n  necessity, picked their pockets, opened their drawers, &c., in search\r\n  of money believed to be hidden. Their wives actually desired that\r\n  their husbands might get drunk on Saturday night, because they could\r\n  the more easily abstract the money from their persons.\r\n\r\n  “Upon the termination of my inquiries I induced the men, with little\r\n  difficulty, to receive their money in the way the other men did, viz.,\r\n  by regular weekly advances, rather under their average earnings, with\r\n  a quarterly or annual settlement; and I took care that the wives\r\n  should know exactly what their husbands would receive; and from the\r\n  day the plan commenced, a most decided and permanent improvement took\r\n  place in the habits of the men, and in the appearance and general\r\n  comforts of their families. One of the men commenced saving money\r\n  immediately. This man’s savings, as I have lately been informed, now\r\n  in January, 1841, considerably exceed 1000_l._; whereas, during the\r\n  five or six years which he passed in the same occupation before the\r\n  change of plan, he made no saving whatever.”\r\n\r\nAnother valuable example of the easy means possessed by employers of\r\npreventing the formation of habits destructive to the health and\r\nprosperity of workmen, is set forth in the evidence of Mr. Peter\r\nFairbairn, the extensive mechanist of Leeds.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Fairbairn_ examined.\r\n\r\n  “You are a mechanist at Leeds?—I am.\r\n\r\n  “What number of men do you employ?—Between 500 and 600.\r\n\r\n  “Have you ever observed any effects produced in the habits of the\r\n  labouring classes in respect to drinking intoxicating liquors by the\r\n  mode in which they are paid their wages?—Yes, there are two modes in\r\n  which wages are most frequently paid, and both these modes are\r\n  prejudicial in their effects. The first effect is connected with the\r\n  place of payment. Some masters pay at the public-house, others pay the\r\n  men at the counting-house after the work is completed. The effects\r\n  produced by payment at the public-house are to oblige the workman to\r\n  drink. He is kept waiting in the public-house during a long time,\r\n  varying from two to three hours, sometimes as much as five hours. The\r\n  workman cannot remain in the house without drinking, even if he were\r\n  alone, as he must make some return to the landlord for the use of the\r\n  room. But the payment of a number of men occupies time in proportion\r\n  to their numbers. We find that to pay our own men in the most rapid\r\n  way requires from two to three hours. The assembled workmen, of\r\n  course, stimulate each other to drink. Out of 100 men, all of whom\r\n  will, probably, have taken their quart of porter or ale, above a third\r\n  will go home in a state of drunkenness—of drunkenness to the extent of\r\n  imbecility. The evil is not confined to the men; the destructive habit\r\n  is propagated in their families. At each public-house a proportion of\r\n  the poor women, their wives, attend. According to my own observation,\r\n  full 10 per cent. of the men have their wives and children in\r\n  attendance at the public-house. The poor women have no other mode of\r\n  getting money to market with on the Saturday night than attending at\r\n  the public-house to get it from their husbands. They may have children\r\n  whom they cannot leave at home, and these they bring with them. The\r\n  wives are thus led to drink, and they and their children are made\r\n  partakers at the scenes of drunkenness and riot; for there are not\r\n  unfrequently quarrels leading to fights between the workmen when\r\n  intoxicated.\r\n\r\n  “Do not these late hours, consequent on such a mode of payment, also\r\n  lead them to the inferior markets, and prejudice the domestic economy\r\n  of the labourer’s household?—Yes, they have the less money to purchase\r\n  with, and must purchase an inferior quality of provisions. I have\r\n  observed that they do so. They are driven to the inferior shopkeepers\r\n  who keep open late; and they are also driven to make purchases on the\r\n  Sunday morning. It is only the inferior shopkeepers or hucksters who\r\n  will sell on the Sunday morning, and they sell an inferior commodity\r\n  at a higher price. Then the Sunday morning is thus occupied; the\r\n  husband, and sometimes the wife, is kept in a state of feverish\r\n  excitement by the previous night’s debauch: they are kept in a state\r\n  of filth and disorder; even the face is unwashed; no clean clothes are\r\n  put on, and there is no church attendance, and no decency. Indeed, by\r\n  the pressure of the wants created by habits of drinking, there is soon\r\n  no means to purchase clean or respectable clothes, and lastly, no\r\n  desire to purchase them. The man, instead of cleaning himself, and\r\n  appearing at church on the Sunday, or walking out with his family on\r\n  the Sunday afternoon in a respectable condition, remains at home in\r\n  filth, and in a filthy hovel. Of course there are no contributions to\r\n  sick-clubs under such circumstances; and if the workman has been\r\n  previously led to join a club, he is almost always in arrear with his\r\n  contributions, and is ultimately expelled. On the occurrence of the\r\n  disease to which such habits predispose him, there is nothing but the\r\n  most abject and complete destitution and pauperism. I have served the\r\n  office of churchwarden and overseer in Leeds three years, and, having\r\n  attended the weekly Board where applications for relief are made, I\r\n  have seen the end of this train of circumstances in the applications\r\n  for relief from parties who had previously been in the receipt of good\r\n  and sufficient wages (and even high wages) to have prevented such\r\n  applications. I have observed the whole train of these consequences in\r\n  several large works in London as well as in this town.\r\n\r\n  “Are there not consequences too to the employers themselves, as well\r\n  as to the ratepayers, in connexion with the habits of labourers thus\r\n  created?—One consequence of these habits is the loss of time at the\r\n  commencement of the week, and the comparative inefficiency of the\r\n  workmen when they do come. The workman who has been absent from\r\n  drunkenness comes to his work pale, emaciated, shattered, and\r\n  unnerved. From my own observation in my own branch of manufacture, I\r\n  should say that the quantity and quality of the work executed during\r\n  the first day or so would be about one-fifth less than that obtainable\r\n  from a steady and attentive workman.\r\n\r\n  “This deterioration, then, in a large number of workmen engaged in a\r\n  manufactory, may be noted as an important item of saving for the\r\n  consideration of a provident manufacturer?—Undoubtedly. Another\r\n  consideration for the master is the fact that such workmen, the most\r\n  idle and dissolute, are the most discontented, and are always the\r\n  foremost in mischievous strikes and combinations.\r\n\r\n  “You have spoken of the consequences of making the public-house a\r\n  place of payment; what are the comparative effects of making the\r\n  payments at the counting-house?—A considerable reduction of the evil.\r\n  Payments to large numbers at the counting-house is still, however,\r\n  attended with much inconvenience and evil. The payment of the number\r\n  of men employed at our works (between five and six hundred) would, as\r\n  I have stated, occupy between two and three hours. This mode of\r\n  payment, therefore, implies the keeping of a large crowd together\r\n  during that time. During that time appointments are made of meetings\r\n  at public-houses to drink that would not otherwise take place. It also\r\n  generates discontent: it gives an opportunity, by assembling a crowd,\r\n  for any discontented or mischievous person to operate upon a large\r\n  mass of people. Formerly the business of my manufactory, and the\r\n  welfare of the working people, were very seriously interrupted by\r\n  strikes; and I could not help observing the facilities which such\r\n  meetings gave to such mischievous persons.\r\n\r\n  “What is the mode of payment which you have adopted?—I send the pay\r\n  clerk into each room in the manufactory immediately after the dinner\r\n  hour, and he pays each man individually. Each man is scarcely taken\r\n  from his work half a minute. I may observe, that some masters, to save\r\n  themselves trouble, so as to avoid the inconvenience of getting small\r\n  change, will pay several men together. This again leads to the\r\n  public-house, where the men commonly go to get change to divide the\r\n  money amongst them; I therefore avoid paying any two men together, and\r\n  subjecting them to temptation as well as inconvenience and cost. Each\r\n  of my workmen being paid in the shop, without the loss of a minute,\r\n  may go at once directly home at the time when the work closes. He is\r\n  thus afforded an opportunity of going at once to the market at an\r\n  early hour, and is subjected to no factitious inducements to drink,\r\n  disorder, improvidence, and destitution.\r\n\r\n  “What is the average time thus saved to each of the 550 workmen in\r\n  your manufactory, as compared with the more ordinary mode of\r\n  payment?—About an hour and a half, or half the three hours of payment.\r\n\r\n  “Then, by this means, instead of bringing 550 persons to the one\r\n  person, the pay clerk, sending that one person to the 550 persons, you\r\n  save to them upwards of 800 hours of inconvenient waiting?—Just so.\r\n\r\n  “How many persons, on the average, have you absent from work on the\r\n  Monday morning?—Not more than from four to five, until eight o’clock\r\n  in the morning; and on the return to work after dinner from one to two\r\n  persons.\r\n\r\n  “That is from one to two persons the entire day during the Monday, out\r\n  of between five and six hundred workpeople?—Yes.\r\n\r\n  “What number would have been absent on the Monday under the ordinary\r\n  circumstances?—About 30 per cent., or one-third, would be drunk on the\r\n  Saturday night; and full 10 per cent. would not make their appearance\r\n  until the Tuesday morning. Instead of only two absent during the whole\r\n  of the day, I should have more than 50; or, in other words, more than\r\n  50 families not only distressed by what is spent in drink, but losing\r\n  one-sixth of their earnings, and I as a master losing from their\r\n  deteriorated work on the days when they do return. I beg leave further\r\n  to observe, that mere education in reading or writing, precepts or\r\n  preaching, are of very little avail against the temptations to drink\r\n  held out to working men; and I am confident that if employers could be\r\n  made to see and attend to their mutual interests, by a little care in\r\n  the removal of temptations, they might generally prevent the most\r\n  fruitful cause of disorder, destitution, and pauperism, at least as\r\n  extensively as I have prevented those consequences to my workmen and\r\n  their families by the adoption of the means I have described.”\r\n\r\nIn the course of a report on the sanitary condition of the labouring\r\nclasses in the town of Lancaster, received from _Dr. De Vitrie_, the\r\neffects of an amended practice are thus noticed:—\r\n\r\n  “An excellent example is shown in this neighbourhood by the wealthy\r\n  manufacturers and tradesmen almost universally paying their men’s\r\n  weekly wages on a Friday evening (or, what is still better, early on\r\n  Saturday morning) instead of Saturday, thus putting it into the power\r\n  of all to spend their money to the best advantage at Saturday’s\r\n  market, and obviating the great temptation which formerly existed of\r\n  spending their earnings, or a large proportion of them, in the\r\n  public-houses and beer-shops after the termination of the week’s\r\n  labour. It may be said that such parties are as likely to dissipate on\r\n  a Friday as on a Saturday evening. The propensity I grant may be the\r\n  same, but there is no intervening day of rest to shake off the effects\r\n  of intemperance and indulgence, and as workmen must resume their\r\n  labours on the Saturday, hence it is that such a regulation exercises\r\n  not only a salutary but a provident influence.”\r\n\r\nThe _Rev. Whitwell Elwin_ observes—\r\n\r\n  “Where gain was dependant on the growth of better habits, I have seen,\r\n  with the agency of judicious individuals, encouraging cases of\r\n  complete reformation: an intelligent engineer in this neighbourhood\r\n  was about paying off a man whose profligacy had left him without a\r\n  decent covering, and who often depended for his victuals upon the\r\n  generosity of his fellow-workmen. He begged hard to be retained, and\r\n  his master at last consented, on condition that he himself should lay\r\n  out his wages for the next three months. He provided the man with good\r\n  lodgings, allowed him tea, sugar, and bread and butter night and\r\n  morning; meat, and either bread or potatoes, with a pint of beer every\r\n  day for his dinner; and before the appointed time was up, bought him\r\n  with the surplus a new suit of clothes. The man was so sensible of the\r\n  advantage of the change, that he became one of the most thrifty and\r\n  valuable workmen; and his master has often since tried the same\r\n  experiment with the same success. If we could collect all the\r\n  philanthropy and much of the self-interest of the country into wise\r\n  and profitable channels, we might, I believe in a twelvemonth, do much\r\n  towards regenerating the most wretched classes.”\r\n\r\nOne employer of numerous labourers in a well-conducted establishment\r\nstated to me that after long experience he found it necessary, for the\r\nprotection of the workpeople, as well as the efficiency of the\r\nestablishment, invariably to discharge every workman who was guilty of\r\ndrunkenness; and that the first visible sign to excite suspicion of the\r\nhabits of intoxication was the absence of personal cleanliness, then a\r\npallid countenance, on which inquiry was made. Another employer of\r\nnumerous labourers, _Mr. William Fairbairn_, of Manchester (the brother\r\nof Mr. Fairbairn, of Leeds), who has had between one and two thousand\r\nworkpeople engaged in the manufactories of machinery in the firm of\r\nwhich he is the first partner, stated, in answer to the question,—\r\n\r\n  “What are their habits in respect to sobriety?—I may mention that I\r\n  strictly prohibit on my works the use of beer or fermented liquors of\r\n  any sort, or of tobacco. I enforce the prohibition of fermented\r\n  liquors so strongly that, if I found any man transgressing the rule in\r\n  that respect, I would instantly discharge him without allowing him\r\n  time to put on his coat.\r\n\r\n  “Have you any peculiar grounds for adopting this course?—No; but as\r\n  respects myself I wish to have an orderly set of workmen; and in the\r\n  next place I am decidedly of opinion that it is better for the men\r\n  themselves and for their families.\r\n\r\n  “Are you aware that it is a prevalent opinion that strong drink is\r\n  necessary as a stimulus for the performance of labour?—I am aware that\r\n  that was a prevalent opinion amongst employers of labour, but it is\r\n  now very generally abandoned; there are nevertheless some foundries in\r\n  which there is drinking throughout the works all day long. It is\r\n  observable, however, of the men employed as workmen, that they do not\r\n  work so well; their perceptions are clouded, and they are stupified\r\n  and heavy. I have provided water for the use of the men in every\r\n  department of the works. In summer time the men engaged in the\r\n  strongest work, such as the strikers to the heavy forges, drink water\r\n  very copiously. In general the men who drink water are really more\r\n  active, and do more work, and are more healthy than the workmen who\r\n  drink fermented liquors. I observed on a late journey to\r\n  Constantinople that the boatmen or rowers to the caiques, who are\r\n  perhaps the first rowers in the world, drink nothing but water; and\r\n  they drink that profusely during the hot months of the summer. The\r\n  boatmen and water-carriers of Constantinople are decidedly in my\r\n  opinion the finest men in Europe as regards their physical\r\n  development, and they are all water drinkers: they may take a little\r\n  sherbet, but in other respects are what we should call in this\r\n  country, tee-totallers.\r\n\r\n  “What is their diet?—Chiefly bread; now and then a cucumber, with\r\n  cherries, figs, dates, mulberries, or other fruits which are abundant\r\n  there; now and then a little fish.\r\n\r\n  “Do they ever use animal food?—Occasionally I believe the flesh of\r\n  goats, but I never saw them eating any other than the diet I have\r\n  described.\r\n\r\n  “Did they appear to eat more than the European workmen?—About the\r\n  same; if anything, more moderate as respects the quantity.”\r\n\r\nI have collected much other information to the same effect. In the\r\nAppendix, I have given, as a contrast, an instance of arrangements which\r\ntend to promote the habit of drinking, and the consequences, a part of\r\nwhich are met and dealt with by the administrators of relief from the\r\npoor’s rates, in the shape of claims to relief on the ground of sickness\r\nand consequent destitution; and another part of which fall as disorders\r\nand crimes to be encountered by the police.\r\n\r\nI submit here one important instance of the exercise of a wise influence\r\non the habits of the agricultural population:—\r\n\r\nIn a form of lease used in leasing the Highland property of the Duke of\r\nSutherland, which appears to be ably devised to ensure progressive\r\nimprovement, care for the moral welfare of the population is not\r\nomitted. The poverty, disorder, and crime engendered by the destructive\r\nhabit of whisky drinking, fostered by the practice of illicit\r\ndistillation, is encountered by a clause which provides that if the\r\ntenant “distill whiskey, or shall permit any one to distill whisky, or\r\nshall sell or permit the same to be sold on the said premises hereby\r\nset, or on any part of the said estate, or shall contravene any of the\r\nregulations the said proprietors have established for the management\r\nthereof, and that if he or they shall be convicted of any of the said\r\noffences before the sheriff, depute, or substitute, or any two of his\r\nMajesty’s justices of the peace for the said county; then, in either of\r\nthese events or cases, this agreement shall be, _ipso facto_, void and\r\nnull, and the said tenant shall be forthwith removable by summary\r\nprocess before the judge ordinary, whereupon decree shall be pronounced\r\nupon relevant proof of the fact.”\r\n\r\nThe lease ensures the improvement of the tenements, and provides that\r\n“no earthen houses or huts are permitted to be built on any\r\nconsideration.” The one provision is the proper complement of the other;\r\nand Mr. Hill gives his testimony to the excellent effect which the\r\nsupport given to the law, and the prevention of whisky drinking, produce\r\non the habits of the population.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Employers’ Influence on the Health of Workpeople by the Promotion of\r\n                         Personal Cleanliness._\r\n\r\nI proceed to another instance of the power of the employers to protect\r\nthe health, as well as the morals of their workpeople, by influencing\r\ntheir habits of personal cleanliness.\r\n\r\nBut I shall first submit a few instances of the extent and prevalence of\r\npersonal uncleanliness amongst whole classes of workpeople.\r\n\r\n_Mr. John Kennedy_, in the course of the examinations of some colliers\r\nin Lancashire, asked one of them—\r\n\r\n  “How often do the drawers (those employed in drawing coals) wash their\r\n  bodies?—None of the drawers ever wash their bodies. I never wash my\r\n  body; I let my shirt rub the dirt off; my shirt will show that. I wash\r\n  my neck and ears, and face, of course.\r\n\r\n  “Do you think it usual for the young women (engaged in the colliery)\r\n  to do the same as you do?—I do not think it is usual for the lasses to\r\n  wash their bodies; my sisters never wash themselves, and seeing is\r\n  believing; they wash their faces, necks, and ears.\r\n\r\n  “When a collier is in full dress, he has white stockings, and very\r\n  tall shirt necks, very stiffly starched, and ruffles?—That is very\r\n  sure, sir; but they never wash their bodies underneath; I know that;\r\n  and their legs and bodies are as black as your hat.”\r\n\r\nOne labourer remembered that a particular event took place at Easter,\r\n“because it was then he washed his feet.” The effects of these habits\r\nare seen at the workhouse on almost every one of the paupers admitted.\r\nWhen it is necessary to wash them on their admission, they usually\r\nmanifest an extreme repugnance to the process. Their common feeling was\r\nexpressed by one of them when he declared that he considered it “equal\r\nto robbing him of a great coat which he had had for some years.” The\r\nfilthy condition in which they are found on admission into the hospitals\r\nis frequently sufficient to account for the state of disease in which\r\nthey appear, and the act of cleansing them is itself the most efficient\r\ncure. The out-door service of the union medical officers amidst such a\r\npopulation is often most painful and disgusting: _e. g._—\r\n\r\n_Mr. J. F. Handley_, medical officer of the Chipping Norton union,\r\nstates in his report—\r\n\r\n  “When the small pox was prevalent in this district, I attended a man,\r\n  woman, and five children, all lying ill with the confluent species of\r\n  that disorder, in one bed-room, and having only two beds amongst them.\r\n  The walls of the cottage were black, the sheets were black, and the\r\n  patients themselves were blacker still; two of the children were\r\n  absolutely sticking together. It was indeed a gloomy scene. I have\r\n  relished many a biscuit and glass of wine in Mr. Grainger’s\r\n  dissecting-room when ten dead bodies were lying on the tables under\r\n  dissection, but was entirely deprived of appetite during my attendance\r\n  upon these cases. The smell on entering the apartments was exceedingly\r\n  nauseous, and the room would not admit of free ventilation.”\r\n\r\nSuch conditions of the population, of habitual personal and domestic\r\nfilth, are not necessary to any occupation; they are not the necessary\r\nconsequence of poverty, and are the type of neglect and indolence; this\r\nis proved by the example of men engaged in the same occupations with\r\nimproved habits. The medical officers of the Merthyr Tydvill union, in\r\ntheir returns, represent the health of the colliery population to be\r\nvery good, a circumstance which is ascribed to their habitual\r\ncleanliness.\r\n\r\n_Mr. J. L. Roberts_, surgeon, states—\r\n\r\n  “The colliers in our district invariably, on their return from the\r\n  pits in the evening to their houses, strip to the skin, and wash\r\n  themselves perfectly clean in a tub of lukewarm water, and wipe with\r\n  towels until the cuticle is dry. The miners are not so particular. I\r\n  firmly believe that the health of other workmen employed generally\r\n  about the ironworks is not so permanently good as the colliers; they,\r\n  generally speaking, not undergoing complete ablution as the colliers\r\n  do. Generally, the colliers are quite free from any cutaneous disease,\r\n  or at least not so much affected with psora, &c., as the generality of\r\n  their fellow-workmen. Cutaneous diseases are frequent amongst children\r\n  from want of cleanliness.”\r\n\r\nIn the places of work where there is the greatest need for cleanliness,\r\nin every place where there is a steam-engine, hot water, which is\r\ncommonly allowed to run waste, is already provided in abundance for warm\r\nor tepid baths, not only for the workpeople, but, where there are\r\nnumerous engines, for the whole population. If the same hot water arose\r\nat the same heat and abundance from any natural spring, baths would be\r\nerected, and medical treatises would be written in commendation of its\r\nmedicinal virtues, which, the better opinion appears now to be, are\r\nascribable, in the majority of instances, simply to the hot water, and\r\nto its application in cases where it had not before been used. Hot or\r\ntepid baths are deemed of more importance for the labouring classes in\r\nwinter than are cold baths in summer, and they might be generally\r\nprovided for the working classes in the manufacturing districts at a\r\ncost utterly inconsiderable.\r\n\r\nA few years since a gentleman, observing some ditches in London, in the\r\nneighbourhood of the City-road, smoking with clean hot water running\r\naway from the steam-engine of a manufactory, directed attention to the\r\nwaste, and suggested the expediency of using that water to supply public\r\nwarm or tepid baths. After a time the suggestion was acted upon as a\r\nprivate speculation, and large swimming-baths were constructed; one,\r\nwith superior accommodation and decorations at 1_s._; another, with less\r\ncostly fittings-up, at 6_d._ the bath. These were luxurious tepid baths,\r\nkept at a heat of 84°. The example appears to have been followed in\r\nWestminster by the establishment of similar tepid swimming-baths, where\r\nonly 3_d._ is charged to persons of the working-class. As many as 2000\r\nand 3000 of this class have resorted to these baths in one day, and the\r\nbath at the lowest charge is stated to make the best return for the\r\ncapital invested in it. Similar establishments are, we believe, in\r\nprogress in other parts of the metropolis. _Mr. Samuel Greg_, at\r\nBollington, has formed baths for the use of his workpeople, which he\r\nthus describes:—\r\n\r\n  “The bathing-room is a small building, close behind the mill, about 25\r\n  feet by 15. The baths, to the number of seven, are ranged along the\r\n  walls, and a screen about six feet high, with benches on each side of\r\n  it, is fixed down the middle of the room. The cold water is supplied\r\n  from a cistern above the engine-house, and the hot water from a large\r\n  tub which receives the waste steam from the dressing-room, and is kept\r\n  constantly at boiling temperature. A pipe from each of these cisterns\r\n  opens into every bath, so that they are ready for instant use. The men\r\n  and women bathe on alternate days; and a bath-keeper for each attends\r\n  for an hour and a half in the evening. This person has the entire care\r\n  of the room, and is answerable for everything that goes on in it. When\r\n  any one wishes to bathe he comes to the counting-house for a ticket,\r\n  for which he pays a penny, and without which he cannot be admitted to\r\n  the bathing-room. Some families, however, subscribe a shilling\r\n  a-month, which entitles them to five baths weekly; and these hold a\r\n  general subscriber’s ticket, which always gives him admittance to the\r\n  room. I think the number of baths taken weekly varies from about 25 to\r\n  70 or 80. We pay the bath-keepers 2_s._ 6_d._ and 2_s._ a-week, and I\r\n  believe this amount has been more than covered by the receipts. The\r\n  first cost of erecting the baths was about 80_l._”\r\n\r\nThe feet of the female as well of the male workers in such\r\nestablishments, who work in the mills without their stockings, are seen\r\ncoated with the filth of years, for which there is no other necessity\r\nthan their own habitual indolence. These habits mere admonitions will\r\nnot always remove from the adult population. A manufacturer in London,\r\nwho did not care to take this trouble with them, began with his\r\napprentices, and took them several times to the new tepid baths, as a\r\nholiday and a reward, until they had experienced the comfort, and had\r\nformed a habit, when he left them to themselves, and they paid out of\r\ntheir own pocket-money the small amount necessary to defray the\r\nexpenses. Where the use of hot or warm water has been given to the\r\nworkpeople, and baths have been provided, they have frequently been\r\ndefective in some important point. _Dr. Barham_ states that the miners,\r\non their ascent to the ground, have commonly only the means of using the\r\nhot water from a rivulet on a bleak and exposed situation; in other\r\nplaces, as where bath-rooms are provided, the accommodation for dressing\r\nwas defective, in being cold and chilling instead of being made warm, as\r\nit might be at a very trifling expense. It was only at Camborne, the\r\nmine already noticed, that anything deserving the name of proper baths\r\nhad been erected. _Dr. Barham_ observes, in a communication on this\r\nsubject—\r\n\r\n  “The security from chill during the ablution, and the abundance and\r\n  comfortable temperature of the water in the cases mentioned as\r\n  examples of superior accommodation, have no doubt contributed to a\r\n  comparative immunity from pulmonary disease and catarrhal affections,\r\n  which the managers and the men themselves have noticed since this\r\n  provision has been made.\r\n\r\n  “The cost of the practice is so inconsiderable as to be unworthy\r\n  notice. Timber and iron for such purposes are always to be found in\r\n  our mines among what is no longer fit for its original destination. No\r\n  charge of any kind is made for the use of these accommodations.\r\n\r\n  “The owners of steam-engines might always supply hot water, in\r\n  proportion to the amount of condensation effected, without any extra\r\n  cost to themselves, when they do not employ the heated water to some\r\n  purpose of their own. In some mines the warm water is husbanded for\r\n  the cleansing of the ores, but this is an exceptional case. Generally\r\n  speaking, there is a great quantity of iron cylinder and other\r\n  materials convertible to the conveyance of the water, which maybe\r\n  supplied at a very low rate, as unserviceable for engine-work.\r\n\r\n  “I have thought that steam-engines are not the only sources for the\r\n  supply of hot water to the public at an insignificant cost. All works\r\n  in which great heat is employed, or almost all such works, might\r\n  supply heat to large bodies of water after the fuel has been most\r\n  economically applied to their own purposes. Smelting-houses,\r\n  foundries, glass-houses, for instances, have always heat enough to\r\n  spare for the warming of extensive thermæ. By the use of brick pipes,\r\n  surrounded by wood or some bad conductor, such heat, first applied to\r\n  the bottom of large reservoirs, might be distributed over extensive\r\n  districts, and buildings might be warmed and workshops supplied with\r\n  warm water for the thorough purification of the labourers, at a very\r\n  trifling expense. My own opinion is, that a system of _washing_ is\r\n  more desirable as a national habit than a system of _bathing_. The\r\n  latter is doubtless excellent for bodies of men who are under\r\n  effectual control, and for the young.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Employers’ Influence on the Health of Workpeople by the Ventilation of\r\n    Places of Work, and the Prevention of Noxious Fumes, Dust, &c._\r\n\r\nIn some of the “dusty trades,” the excessive amount of premature\r\nmortality is so great as to justify interference, defensively, as\r\nagainst the charges which, from the neglect of sanitary measures, fall\r\nneither upon the employer nor upon the consumer, who directly benefit by\r\nthe produce of the industry, but upon ratepayers, to whom the\r\nmanufactory itself may be a nuisance. In the instance of such trades,\r\npersonal cleanliness is so far a requisite as to justify an additional\r\nrate of insurance where it is neglected. Yet the regulations preventive\r\nof disease are by no means onerous, either in their cost or their\r\ninterference with the processes. Some of the noxious manufactures, and\r\nespecially those in lead, have been the subject of examination by the\r\n“Conseil de Salubrité of Paris,” and the preventive rules they\r\nprescribed were as follows:—1. The establishment of a good ventilation\r\nin the workshops or manufactories. 2. Exacting from the workpeople close\r\nattention to personal cleanliness; obliging them to wash the hands and\r\nface before dining, and before leaving the workshop; forbidding them\r\ntaking any of their meals in the workshop, and, by reasoning and\r\ninformation, directing their attention to the dangers by which they are\r\nsurrounded. 3. Employing the practicable means for conducting the\r\nprocesses so as to raise the least dust possible. 4. Boarding off the\r\nmills and sieves, so as to prevent the escape of the smaller particles.\r\n5. Requiring of the workmen engaged in the processes where there is\r\nlead-dust or any other injurious dust suspended in the air, that they\r\ncover the nose and mouth with a handkerchief slightly moistened. 6.\r\nSubjecting the workshop to occasional medical inspection, in order to\r\nprevent the intensity of any maladies that break out, and with that view\r\nto examine the workmen from time to time to detect any symptoms of\r\ndisease, and to oblige the workman attacked to abstain from work until\r\nthe medical officer declares that he may resume it without\r\ninconvenience. 7. Obliging workmen to wear frocks or blouses, which they\r\nshould leave in the workshop when they quit work; and these blouses\r\nshould from time to time be washed. 8. Sending away from the workshop\r\nevery workman who gives himself up to debauchery or drunkenness. 9.\r\nEndeavouring to get the workmen, (_i. e._ workers in lead) to form the\r\nhabit of drinking every day, on leaving the workshop, a little\r\nhydro-sulphuretted water, to neutralize the effects of the lead that may\r\nhave been taken into the stomach.\r\n\r\nAll these regulations, with the medical attendance for the purpose of\r\nprevention, would be greatly below any charge of insurance to the\r\nindividual workman for procuring medical attendance and remedies when\r\nthrown out of work by sickness.\r\n\r\nIn some of the trades, scattered instances of attention to cleanliness\r\nand measures of prevention are found: for example, amongst the\r\njourneymen painters. In answer to a question put by Dr. Mitchell to _Mr.\r\nTomlins_, the clerk to the Painters’ Company, whether painters suffer so\r\nmuch as formerly from the disease to which they are peculiarly liable,\r\nthe clerk says,—\r\n\r\n  “Not so much as formerly. This has been ascertained by a charity\r\n  administered at Painters’ Hall to men labouring under sickness. The\r\n  men are now more attentive to cleanliness. Formerly they would throw\r\n  their clothes on their beds and go to their meals without washing\r\n  their hands. A large proportion of the journeymen now carry a\r\n  workingdress to their job with them, and when they quit work at night\r\n  they exchange and put on clean clothes which are free from paint. This\r\n  applies more particularly to the westward of Temple Bar. One\r\n  master-painter of my acquaintance, Mr. Thornton, of Doctors’ Commons,\r\n  keeps a pail of solution of potash in his shop, in which the men wash\r\n  their hands, and which takes off every particle of paint; and it is\r\n  worthy of remark that only two men in 20 years have been afflicted\r\n  with paralysis in his employ. This is taken from 15 men constantly\r\n  employed on an average for seven years.”\r\n\r\nIt will suggest itself that another generation of workpeople, and their\r\npremature sickness and death, ought not to pass away leaving this\r\npractice confined to the painters to the west of Temple Bar, and leaving\r\nthe beneficent expedient exclusively to the shop of Mr. Thornton, of\r\nDoctors’ Commons.\r\n\r\nIn connexion with the instance of the painters, I may give the following\r\nfrom _Mr. James Gibbins_, a manufacturer of colours at the Mile-end\r\nroad. He was asked—“Are there any peculiar hazards to health connected\r\nwith the trade?” He replies,—\r\n\r\n  “Arsenic and lead are employed in making colours, and hence injury\r\n  does arise, but such need not necessarily be the case; but although\r\n  water, towels, and soap are placed at the use of the men, there is no\r\n  persuading them to be habitually cleanly. After making or grinding\r\n  colours, they will not take the trouble to wash their hands, but\r\n  merely wipe them a little on their clothes, and then will take their\r\n  bread and meat, by which particles are carried off into the stomach.\r\n  It is impossible to persuade the men to be more cautious. The lead is\r\n  much more in use than the arsenic, and on the whole does more harm, as\r\n  the men are more on their guard against the arsenic.”\r\n\r\nThe prevalent impression upon such instances would be expressed by such\r\nphrases as, “If men will be so careless, there is no help for it; they\r\nmust take the consequences:” but they only take a part of the\r\nconsequences—the sickness; the main part of the consequences are taken\r\nby others, especially if they are married, when the premature widowhood\r\nand orphanage are sustained by the wife and children, who are maintained\r\nat the expense of the relations or of the public. This recklessness is\r\nhowever the result of neglected education, of which the workmen are the\r\nvictims, and for measures of beneficence such workmen are to be regarded\r\nand treated as children, for they are children in intellect. An instance\r\nof a beneficial measure of compulsory prevention taken by some employers\r\nof labour is mentioned by Mr. John Kennedy, jun., in a report on the\r\ncondition of some classes of workpeople examined under the Commission of\r\nInquiry into the Employment of Children, not included in the regulations\r\nof the Factory Act. Some workmen employed in “Kyanizing” wood became\r\nfrequently ill from the fumes created in the process, to which fumes\r\nthey unnecessarily exposed themselves. Admonitions to care were found to\r\nbe of no avail, and the employer at length gave notice that he would\r\ndischarge entirely from employment the first that was attacked with the\r\npeculiar illness produced by the fumes of the metal. This threat was\r\nacted upon, and no other cases of illness afterwards occurred.\r\n\r\nIn France, where the diseases by which the working classes are afflicted\r\nhave been investigated by those medical men who have given their\r\nattention to the improvement of the public health, the general\r\nconclusion has been established of the futility of leaving protective\r\nmeasures to the voluntary adoption of the individual workman. In the\r\ncourse of one of his reports, _M. Duchâtelet_ observes, that—\r\n\r\n  “It appears certain that the greatest part of the attacks of asphyxia\r\n  which have taken place in the sewers have arisen from the traps being\r\n  closed. I know that it is now enjoined on the workmen to open these\r\n  traps while they are at their labour. But do they do this? Assuredly\r\n  not in by far the majority of cases. Is it not a maxim to render\r\n  independent of the will and superintendence of men, and above all of\r\n  workmen, everything which appertains in a notable manner to their\r\n  preservation? In the grave and learned discussions which have occupied\r\n  this year (1824) the Academy of Sciences, on the means of preventing\r\n  the dangers arising from steam-engines, not only all the members of\r\n  the Commission, but the entire Academy, have been unanimous on the\r\n  necessity of rendering independent of the workmen the direction of the\r\n  level of the water in the boilers, and the tension of the steam. It\r\n  evidently appeared that on this depended the solution of the problem.\r\n  The same thing is now discussing on the subject of lighting by\r\n  hydrogen gas.”\r\n\r\nI will further adduce parallel examples, drawn from experience, in\r\nrespect to the condition of the working population in France. It is\r\ncontained in a treatise by _M. Emile Beres_, on the Means of\r\nAmeliorating the Condition of Artisans:—\r\n\r\n  “The condition of the labouring population would be less precarious,\r\n  and their lives less exposed to accidents of every kind, if more\r\n  foresight presided over their operations. Employers are often guilty\r\n  of unpardonable carelessness with respect to the employed. To see\r\n  their conduct, one would suppose that the men in their service were\r\n  inert machines, or else that they possessed the power of the Creator\r\n  to reconstruct broken limbs, to restore exhausted constitutions, or to\r\n  give life to the dead. Here a deleterious atmosphere, which ought to\r\n  be carefully purified, is imprudently allowed to be inhaled; there a\r\n  poison, which ought to be handled with precaution, is allowed to\r\n  penetrate every pore. Further on, as if man had wings, he is embarked\r\n  on the most fragile scaffolds. Again, he is inconsiderately left to\r\n  prosecute dangerous researches which demand the utmost care. It is not\r\n  thus that we should act when the health and life of human beings are\r\n  in question. To such neglects how many families owe their poverty and\r\n  misery!\r\n\r\n  “There have long existed mills to grind plaster, which have not,\r\n  nevertheless, prevented the unhappy workmen from being employed, in\r\n  many places, and even in Paris, to pound it with a wooden club, their\r\n  bodies bent towards the ground, and thus inhaling it in such\r\n  quantities that the greatest number of them die young, of pulmonary\r\n  phthisis.\r\n\r\n  “The use of the moveable inodorous tanks has been long understood in\r\n  Paris. It consists in substituting for the tanks of masonry vessels of\r\n  oak, painted, and strongly hooped with iron, so as to allow neither\r\n  matter nor smell to escape. They are placed beneath the pipe which\r\n  conveys the contents of the water-closet, and, when full, are carried\r\n  away, and replaced by others at every hour of the day, without\r\n  difficulty, without danger to the workmen, without inconvenience to\r\n  the inhabitants. Well; not only are the ancient tanks not suppressed\r\n  in favour of this system, so convenient in all respects, but every day\r\n  new ones are constructed, though not a year passes in which we do not\r\n  hear of unhappy men perishing in the process of emptying, suffocated\r\n  by the gas which escapes in their disgusting operation. Now, if we add\r\n  to the danger of emptying the receptacles, the nuisance to all the\r\n  inhabitants of the house, which is infected in its remotest corners,\r\n  as well as the neighbouring houses of the same street, or even\r\n  quarter; when we take into account the damage to furniture (especially\r\n  to things that are gilt) by the escape of sulphureous gas, we shall\r\n  have the measure of the negligence, I will not say of the proprietors\r\n  only who maintain such an abuse without any justifiable motive, but\r\n  even of the authority that suffers it. It is no rare thing, after the\r\n  emptying has taken place, to see asphyxia produced in the masons who\r\n  are employed in repairing the walls, or in remedying the infiltrations\r\n  from the privies.\r\n\r\n  “There is another method, more recent, and, in all probability, more\r\n  advantageous, of preventing the inconveniences of the ancient\r\n  receptacles; it is the system of disinfecting fecal matter, discovered\r\n  by a learned chemist, M. Payen. Independently of its hygienic\r\n  advantages, and the procuring a powerful manure, this method comprises\r\n  a question of human dignity of great value. It is necessary, as far as\r\n  possible, to take from our fellow men the mischievous necessity to\r\n  perform labours which invest them with ideas of disgust.\r\n\r\n  “Since the use of gas for lighting, several accidents have happened.\r\n  Are they not due, for the most part, to the want of precaution in the\r\n  directors of these manufactories, who have not sufficiently prescribed\r\n  to their men the necessary measures of prevention? Should they not all\r\n  know that one must not run with a candle into a place where there is a\r\n  stream of gas, as one would go in search of a stream of water? It is\r\n  this imprudence which commonly occasions the explosions that happen,\r\n  and which are ordinarily followed by the gravest accidents. Do we not\r\n  find the same carelessness in our mines, followed by the same\r\n  catastrophes? It is in vain, therefore, that Sir Humphry Davy applied\r\n  his genius to the discovery of the safety-lamp! Do not the most\r\n  ordinary rules of health condemn the ignorance with which the\r\n  preparations of mercury, of sulphur, of lead, of oxide of copper, &c.,\r\n  are made? In the places, lastly, in which wool, hides, and other\r\n  animal substances are prepared, why not purify the atmosphere in which\r\n  the workmen exist with such difficulty? This omission is the more\r\n  strange, that some centimes of solution of chlorine every day would be\r\n  sufficient to purify the largest shops.\r\n\r\n  “I insist strongly on the contents of this chapter, because it reveals\r\n  one of the deepest plague-spots of the labouring population of towns,\r\n  and because the remedies that it indicates are neither difficult to\r\n  discover, nor expensive in their application. With more solicitude and\r\n  surveillance on the part of the government, with more philanthropy on\r\n  the part of masters, with more precaution as well as self-love on the\r\n  part of the workmen, would our hospitals receive so many unhappy\r\n  beings, and death reap so many victims?”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Employers’ Means of influencing the Condition of the Working Population\r\n                 by regard to respectability in Dress._\r\n\r\nBesides those means which affect immediately the health and moral\r\ncondition of the workpeople, others are within the control of their\r\nemployers which affect the personal appearance, and, through the\r\nself-respect, the morality of the population. _Mr. William Fairbairn_,\r\nin the course of an examination, adverted to the means of promoting\r\nrespectability in personal appearance:—\r\n\r\n  “It is always,” said he, “an indication of looseness of character, and\r\n  a low standard of moral conduct, to see a mechanic in dirt or in his\r\n  working-clothes on Sunday. Thirty years’ experience leads me to draw a\r\n  very unfavourable conclusion as to the future usefulness to me, and of\r\n  success to himself, of any workman whom I see in dirt on a Sunday.\r\n\r\n  “As a general rule, does the advance of his house keep pace with the\r\n  advance in condition of the person?—As a general rule, it does. Better\r\n  personal condition leads to better associates, and commonly to better\r\n  marriage, on which the improved condition of the house is entirely\r\n  dependent. It is due to the labouring classes of females in Lancashire\r\n  and the surrounding districts to state that, in the important\r\n  household virtue of cleanliness, they are superior to the females of\r\n  the same class in Scotland.\r\n\r\n  “Are you aware of what is the condition of their houses. Have you\r\n  visited them?—I have not made it a practice to visit them, I chiefly\r\n  judge of their circumstances from seeing them with their wives and\r\n  families, and their well-dressed and respectable condition on the\r\n  Sundays. These externals are always indications of greater comforts\r\n  and respectability at home. I am a strong advocate for dress, and\r\n  encourage the working men to dress well; if I see any workman in a\r\n  dirty condition and in his working-clothes in the streets on the\r\n  Sunday, I do not, perhaps, speak to him then, but on the Monday I tell\r\n  him that I have been looking over the books, that I find that he has\r\n  had as good wages as other men who dress respectably, and that I do\r\n  not like to have any one about me who will not dress well on the\r\n  Sunday. This intimation has generally had the desired effect.”\r\n\r\n\r\n _Employers’ or Owners’ Influence in the Improvement of Habitations and\r\nsanitary Arrangements for the Protection of the Labouring Classes in the\r\n                           Rural Districts._\r\n\r\nI would now submit, for consideration the evidence collected to show the\r\nappropriate means for the improvement of the condition of the labouring;\r\nclasses in the rural districts; and first, as to the effects produced by\r\nimproved residences:—\r\n\r\nThese are stated in a letter from the chairman of the Bedford union to\r\nMr. Weale, the Assistant-Commissioner of the district, who had been\r\nrequested by the Board to inquire as to the moral as well as the\r\nsanitary effects of improved tenements:—\r\n\r\n                                       “_Turvey Abbey, January 4, 1841._\r\n\r\n  “My dear Sir,—I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the\r\n  1st of January. You there state that, in a Return made to you by the\r\n  Board of Guardians of the Bedford Union on the sanitary condition of\r\n  the labouring population, it is reported that, in a few instances,\r\n  cottages of an improved description have been erected by the employers\r\n  of labour, the advantages of which have had a salutary influence on\r\n  the moral habits of the inmates: and you request to know in what\r\n  particular acts the improvement in moral conduct is displayed.\r\n\r\n  “I have much pleasure in saying that some cases of the kind have come\r\n  under my own observation, and I consider that the improvement has\r\n  arisen a good deal from the parties feeling that they are somewhat\r\n  raised in the scale of society. The man sees his wife and family more\r\n  comfortable than formerly; he has a better cottage and garden: he is\r\n  stimulated to industry, and as he rises in respectability of station,\r\n  he _becomes aware_ that he has a character to lose. Thus an important\r\n  point is gained. Having acquired certain advantages, he is anxious to\r\n  retain and improve them; he strives more to preserve his independence,\r\n  and becomes a member of benefit, medical, and clothing societies; and\r\n  frequently, besides this, lays up a certain sum, quarterly or\r\n  half-yearly, in the savings’ bank. Almost always attendant upon these\r\n  advantages, we find the man sending his children to be regularly\r\n  instructed in a Sunday, and, where possible, in a day-school, and\r\n  himself and family more constant in their attendance at some place of\r\n  worship on the Lord’s-day. I know of more instances than one where, in\r\n  consequence of encouragement of the kind above mentioned to the father\r\n  of a poor family, the children were regularly sent to school, and\r\n  there became so much improved in character and learning that they are\r\n  now filling situations of high respectability, (one a confidential\r\n  clerk in a large mercantile house in London,) and are assisting to\r\n  support their parents in a manner as delightful as it is creditable.\r\n\r\n  “A man who comes home to a poor, comfortless hovel after his day’s\r\n  labour, and sees all miserable around him, has his spirits more often\r\n  depressed than excited by it. He feels that, do his best, he shall be\r\n  miserable still, and is too apt to fly for a temporary refuge to the\r\n  alehouse or beer-shop. But give him the means of making himself\r\n  comfortable by his own industry, and I am convinced by experience\r\n  that, in many cases, he will avail himself of it.\r\n\r\n                              “Believe me, my dear sir, sincerely yours,\r\n                                              “CHARLES LONGUET HIGGINS.\r\n\r\n  “_To Robert Weale, Esq._,\r\n    “_Assistant Poor Law Commissioner_.”\r\n\r\nThe next exemplification is afforded in a letter from the clerk of the\r\nStafford Union:—\r\n\r\n                                 “_Marston, Stafford, January 20, 1841._\r\n\r\n  “Sir,—I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st\r\n  instant, as to the Return made by the Board of Guardians on the\r\n  sanitary condition of the labouring population of this Union, in which\r\n  it is stated that improved cottages have been erected by landed\r\n  proprietors for their labourers, and the advantages afforded by such\r\n  cottages have had a salutary influence on the moral habits of the\r\n  inmates, and requesting to be informed in what particular acts the\r\n  improvement in moral conduct is displayed.\r\n\r\n  “In answer thereto, I will endeavour to illustrate the remark of the\r\n  Board of Guardians by contrasting the habits, the condition, and\r\n  prospects of a labourer occupying an improved cottage with the\r\n  occupier of a cottage of a contrary description. If we follow the\r\n  agricultural labourer into his miserable dwelling, we shall find it\r\n  consisting of two rooms only; the day-room, in addition to the family,\r\n  contains the cooking utensils, the washing apparatus, agricultural\r\n  implements, and dirty clothes, the windows broken, and stuffed full of\r\n  rags. In the sleeping apartment, the parents and their children, boys\r\n  and girls, are indiscriminately mixed, and frequently a lodger\r\n  sleeping in the same and the only room; generally no window, the\r\n  openings in the half-thatched roof admit light, and expose the family\r\n  to every vicissitude of the weather; the liability of the children so\r\n  situated to contagious maladies frequently plunges the family into the\r\n  greatest misery. The husband, enjoying but little comfort under his\r\n  own roof, resorts to the beer-shop, neglects the cultivation of his\r\n  garden, and impoverishes his family. The children are brought up\r\n  without any regard to decency of behaviour, to habits of foresight, or\r\n  self-restraint; they make indifferent servants; the girls become the\r\n  mothers of bastards, and return home a burden to their parents, or to\r\n  the parish, and fill the workhouse. The boys spend the Christmas\r\n  week’s holiday and their year’s wages in the beer shop, and enter upon\r\n  their new situation in rags. Soon tired of the restraint imposed upon\r\n  them under the roof of their master, they leave his service before the\r\n  termination of the year’s engagement, seek employment as\r\n  day-labourers, not with a view of improving their condition, but with\r\n  a desire to receive and spend their earnings weekly in the beer-shop;\r\n  associating with the worst of characters, they become the worst of\r\n  labourers, resort to poaching, commit petty thefts, and add to the\r\n  county rates by commitments and prosecutions.\r\n\r\n  “On the contrary, on entering an improved cottage, consisting on the\r\n  ground-floor of a room for the family, a wash-house and a pantry, and\r\n  three sleeping-rooms over, with a neat and well-cultivated garden, in\r\n  which the leisure hours of the husband being both pleasantly and\r\n  profitably employed, he has no desire to frequent the beer-shop or\r\n  spend his evenings from home; the children are trained to labour, to\r\n  habits and feelings of independence, and taught to connect happiness\r\n  with industry, and to shrink from idleness and immorality: the girls\r\n  make good servants, obtain the confidence of their employers, and get\r\n  promoted to the best situations. The boys, at the termination of the\r\n  year’s engagement, spend the Christmas week’s holiday comfortably\r\n  under the roof of their parents; clothes suitable for the next year’s\r\n  service are provided, and the residue of wages is deposited in the\r\n  savings’ bank; a system of frugality is engrafted with the first\r\n  deposit, increasing with every addition to the fund: they are\r\n  gradually employed in those departments of labour requiring greater\r\n  skill, and implying more confidence in their integrity and industry,\r\n  and they attain a position in society of comparative independence.\r\n\r\n  “I have selected an extreme case to show more fully the advantages\r\n  derived from improved cottages, and the immoral effects of inferior\r\n  dwellings, unfortunately too numerous, in this Union.\r\n\r\n                                    “I have the honour to be, sir,\r\n                                                “Your obedient servant,\r\n                                                            “PETER LOWE.\r\n\r\n  “_To Robert Veale, Esq.,\r\n    “Assistant Poor Law Commissioner._”\r\n\r\nMuch regret is frequently expressed at the change of condition which has\r\ntaken place in the cultivation of the soil by farm labourers instead of\r\nfarm servants living in the house of the farmer, and subject to the\r\nhousehold rules at his board; but whatever real ground there may be to\r\nregret the change, it appears to be one generally preferred by both\r\nparties, and there appears to be no reason to expect that the ancient\r\nsystem will be revived. In the Appendix I have given an examination of\r\nthe Rev. Thomas Whately, in reference to some frequent and most\r\nimportant mistakes in respect to cottage economy.\r\n\r\nThe Board agreeing that the most important leading examples of\r\nimprovement were to be expected from the benevolence and public spirit\r\nof opulent individuals, requested the assistant commissioners in England\r\nto note the most conspicuous improvements of labourers’ tenements they\r\nhave met with in their districts, and procure plans with a view to their\r\npromulgation. From these I have selected several examples, and have\r\nadded several that I have met with in the course of my own inquiries.\r\n\r\nSome eligible plans of cottage tenements are thus described in _Mr.\r\nTwisleton’s_ report from Norfolk and Suffolk:—\r\n\r\n  “Although the general aspect of the cottages in Norfolk and Suffolk is\r\n  pleasing and attractive, I do not think that these counties can be\r\n  generally cited as abounding with model cottages. Some of the best\r\n  which I have seen belong to the Earl of Stradbroke, at Henham, near\r\n  Halesworth in Suffolk; to the Earl of Leicester, at Holkham; and to\r\n  the Rev. Mr. Benyon, at Culford, about five miles from Bury St.\r\n  Edmunds. Those of the Earl of Stradbroke are built of brick, roofed\r\n  with tiles, have four rooms at least, and have all proper conveniences\r\n  of pantries, cupboards, and out-offices; but, at the same time, as\r\n  they are principally with only one story, so that the bed-rooms are on\r\n  the same floor with the parlour and kitchen, such cottages would only\r\n  be built where land is no object; and they must be considered in the\r\n  light of luxuries and ornaments. Some of the cottages of the Earl of\r\n  Leicester, at Holkham, are perhaps the most substantial and\r\n  comfortable which are to be seen in any part of England; and if all\r\n  the English peasantry could be lodged in similar ones, it would be the\r\n  realization of an Utopia. I have obtained from Mr. Emerson, of\r\n  Holkham, their builder, drawings of the plans and of the elevation of\r\n  eight of these cottages, which are built of brick roofed with tiles. I\r\n  herewith transmit them to you, and it will be observed that there are\r\n  three sets, two of two cottages each, and one of four cottages.\r\n  Without entering into details respecting all the eight, I will draw\r\n  your attention to the double cottages of 1819. Each of these has a\r\n  front room, 17 feet by 12 feet in width, and 7 feet to 7 feet 6 inches\r\n  high; a back kitchen of the same height, and 13 feet by 9 feet wide,\r\n  together with a pantry on the same floor. Above these are three\r\n  bed-rooms which, in different proportions, cover the space already\r\n  specified for the ground-floor. At a convenient distance behind, each\r\n  cottage has attached to it a wash-house, a dirt-bin, a privy, and a\r\n  pig-cot. I may add that the drainage is excellent, that the water is\r\n  good, that each cottage has about 20 rods of garden-ground, and that\r\n  the rent, including gardens, is only three guineas a-year. Hence it is\r\n  not to be wondered at that Mr. Emerson the builder has been enabled to\r\n  say, in a letter to me: ‘I have never known in them an instance of\r\n  fever or any epidemic.’\r\n\r\n  “These cottages are cited as showing what may be done by a landed\r\n  proprietor who takes as great a pride in his good cottages and farms\r\n  as others in fine hunters and race-horses, rather than with the least\r\n  intention of asserting that the example is ever likely to be\r\n  universally imitated. The cost of building two such cottages is stated\r\n  by Mr. Emerson to be 220_l._ or 230_l._, which would be 110_l._ or\r\n  115_l._ each. Now, although individuals, here and there, may build\r\n  cottages without regard to the pecuniary return, it may be assumed as\r\n  incontrovertible, that no class of cottages will be universally\r\n  adopted which does not command a reasonable interest for the money\r\n  expended on them. But considering the cost of repairs, and the\r\n  frequent trouble and uncertainty of obtaining the rents, it will\r\n  probably not be denied that 6_l._ a-year would be the _minimum_ as a\r\n  remunerative rent for the outlay of 110_l._ or 115_l._ on a cottage.\r\n  However, the rent of 6_l._ would scarcely be paid by the agricultural\r\n  population generally at the present wages: for reckoning the rate of\r\n  wages at 12_s._ a-week (which would be high for some parts of the\r\n  country), very few would be willing, out of that sum, to expend 2_s._\r\n  3¾_d._ a-week, or nearly a fifth of their earnings, for the rent of\r\n  their cottage.\r\n\r\n  “I would take, therefore, a more attainable standard of excellence in\r\n  the cottages of the Rev. E. Benyon, at Culford. This is a remarkable\r\n  village of about fifty cottages, built within the last twenty years by\r\n  Mr. Benyon de Beuvoir. The outward appearance of them is pretty, and\r\n  it was this which first attracted my attention to them. They are built\r\n  with bricks, faced with blue flint-stones, which harmonize agreeably\r\n  with the blue slate of the roofs. They have each four rooms—two below\r\n  and two above—with a pantry and a cupboard. I herewith transmit to you\r\n  plans and drawings of five of these cottages in two sets—one\r\n  consisting of double tenements, and one of three tenements. It will be\r\n  observed that the principal room is 14 feet by 12 feet wide, and 7\r\n  feet high, which is inferior in size to those at Holkham, and that\r\n  they have only two bed-rooms, while those at Holkham have three. At\r\n  the distance of a few feet from each set of cottages there is a wooden\r\n  building, roofed with tiles, which comprises a space for fuel, and a\r\n  privy for each cottage, and a common oven. The average cost of the\r\n  double cottages at Culford is stated to have been 170_l._, or 85_l._\r\n  each.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Loudon_, who has paid great attention to the subject of cottage\r\narchitecture, directs attention to the labourers’ cottages, either newly\r\nerected, or altered, or improved, on the estate of Gregory Gregory,\r\nEsq., at Harlaxton, near Grantham, Lincolnshire.\r\n\r\n  “The village of Harlaxton,” says Mr. Loudon, “is, if possible, more\r\n  interesting to us than even the new mansion and gardens. We have seen\r\n  many ornamented villages both at home and abroad, but none so original\r\n  and so much to our taste as this of Mr. Gregory’s. Some of old date\r\n  are too like rows of street houses, such as those of Newnham\r\n  Courtenay, near Oxford; and Harewood, near Leeds; others are too\r\n  affectedly varied and picturesque, such as that at Blaize Castle, near\r\n  Bristol; and some have the houses bedaubed with ornaments that have\r\n  not sufficient relation to use, as when rosettes and sculptures are\r\n  stuck on the walls, instead of applying facings to the windows,\r\n  porches to the doors, and characteristic shafts to the chimney tops.\r\n  We recollect one near Warsaw, which is a repetition of the Grecian\r\n  temple, with a portico at each end; and one at Peckra, near Moscow,\r\n  every opening in which has a pediment over it, with highly enriched\r\n  barge-boards. In some villages the attempt is made to ornament every\r\n  house with trellis-work round the doors and windows, which produces\r\n  great sameness of appearance, and if ornamental, is so at the expense\r\n  of comfort, the creepers by which the trellis-work is covered\r\n  darkening the rooms, and encouraging insects; while, in other\r\n  villages, the cottages are so low and so small, that it is obvious to\r\n  a passing spectator they cannot contain a single wholesome room.\r\n  However, though we find fault with villages ornamented in these ways,\r\n  we are still glad to see them, because any kind of alteration in the\r\n  dwellings and gardens of country labourers can hardly fail to be an\r\n  improvement, both with reference to the occupiers and to the country\r\n  at large.”\r\n\r\nThe external condition of the residence, and the apparent rank it holds,\r\nis not without a beneficial moral effect on the occupants, by increasing\r\ntheir self-respect and pride in the decencies of life. Mr. Loudon’s\r\nenumeration of the requisites for cottage building are given in the\r\nAppendix, together with views of the groups of cottages Mr. Gregory has\r\nerected; contrasted with these is a group of hinds’ cottages, as\r\ndescribed by Dr. Gilly, in his appeal in behalf of the border peasantry,\r\nfrom which a conception may be formed of the great difference in morals\r\nas well as in health that may be anticipated from the effects of the\r\ndifferent order of residences on the population.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GROUP OF NORTHUMBRIAN COTTAGES COPIED FROM REV^D.

I have\r\nbeen favoured by James Monteath, Esq., with a model of the cottages\r\nerected by his father, Sir Stewart Monteath, Bart., for his labourers at\r\nCloseburn. The plan of these cottages presents an important improvement,\r\nby which one fire-place is made to warm two apartments on the same\r\nfloor, and by means of an air pipe warms the air in the two rooms above\r\nthem. I was informed that it admits of a further improvement in\r\npractice, namely, of some means of closing the access of the warm air to\r\nthe sleeping-rooms during summer.\r\n\r\nThe best plans I have obtained of tenements in actual occupation of the\r\nrural manufacturing population appear to be those at Turton, and those\r\nerected at Bollington. The best plans of labourers’ tenements in towns\r\nare those supplied by Mr. Hodgson, and the Committee of Physicians and\r\nSurgeons at Birmingham; the drawings and working plans of which I have\r\nappended.\r\n\r\nIn several of the plans for the rural districts there is one appendage\r\nof the cottage of which the best-informed witnesses consider they ought\r\ninvariably to be divested, namely, a pigsty. The medical witnesses\r\nstrongly object that it is injurious to the health, especially in rows\r\nof cottages, as it occasions accumulations of filthy refuse. Other\r\nwitnesses, such as the Rev. Thomas Whately, object that the pig is not\r\neconomical to the labourer, and that it furnishes a temptation to\r\ndishonesty. His evidence on that subject, and on the other more\r\nimportant question of large cottage allotments, will be found in the\r\nAppendix.\r\n\r\nMr. Loudon has favoured me with two drawings and plans of model\r\ncottages, which need no other explanation than the specification. These\r\ncomprise the best examples that have come under observation during the\r\npresent inquiry of tenements in occupation that are well approved on\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nEvery detail, however, of the materials with which the cottage is\r\nconstructed, and the mode of its construction, deserve, and there is\r\nlittle doubt will obtain, most careful attention, for it is only by\r\nconsidering their comforts in detail that they can be improved, or the\r\naggregate effect on the immense masses of the community can be analyzed\r\nand estimated. For example, it has been mentioned that a decided\r\ndifference is perceptible in the health and condition of workmen of the\r\nsame class who live in houses made of brick as compared with those\r\nliving in houses made of stone.\r\n\r\nA gentleman who has attentively observed the condition of the working\r\nclasses in the north of Lancashire, and the north of Cheshire, states\r\nthat the general health of the labourers in the north of Lancashire is\r\ndecidedly inferior. This inferiority he ascribes to several causes, and,\r\namongst others, to damp cottages, and—\r\n\r\n  “Wood and wattled houses, such as our forefathers built, are the\r\n  driest and warmest of all; brick is inferior in both these requisites\r\n  of a comfortable house; but stone, especially the unhewn stone as it\r\n  is necessarily employed for cottages, is the very worst material\r\n  possible for the purpose. I prefer the Irish mud cottages. The evil\r\n  arises from two causes. The stone is not impervious to water,\r\n  especially when the rain is accompanied by high winds; and it sucks up\r\n  the moisture of the ground, and gives it out into the rooms; but\r\n  principally, stone is a good conductor of heat and cold, so that the\r\n  walls cooled down by the outer air are continually condensing the\r\n  moisture contained in the warmer air of the cottage, just as the\r\n  windows steam on a frosty morning; besides, the abstraction of heat in\r\n  stone houses must be a serious inconvenience. The effect of this\r\n  condensation must be, and is, to make clothes, bedding, &c., damp,\r\n  whenever they are placed near the wall, and therefore extremely\r\n  prejudicial to those who wear the clothes or sleep in the beds. Of\r\n  course I do not attribute all the damp of our cottages in this\r\n  neighbourhood to the stone; much of it is due to the wet climate, wet\r\n  soil, and building so near the ground; but the stone, as a material of\r\n  building, must bear a considerable share of the blame. I believe, too,\r\n  it is partly the cause of the very great difference of cleanliness of\r\n  the Cheshire farming people and ours of the same class.\r\n\r\n  “Indeed the Cheshire people were brought up to wooden cottages: brick\r\n  was of later introduction. The greater facilities and inducements to\r\n  cleanliness in a dry house would, in the course of time, form a more\r\n  cleanly people, and superior healthiness would follow.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Parker_ observes, that the construction of the cottages in\r\nBuckinghamshire is frequently unwholsome:—\r\n\r\n  “The improper materials of which cottages are built, and their\r\n  defective construction, are also the frequent cause of the serious\r\n  indisposition of the inmates. The cottages at Waddesdon, and some of\r\n  the surrounding parishes in the Vale of Aylesbury, are constructed of\r\n  mud, with earth floors and thatched roofs. The vegetable substances\r\n  mixed with the mud to make it bind, rapidly decompose, leaving the\r\n  walls porous. The earth of the floor is full of vegetable matter, and\r\n  from there being nothing to cut off its contact with the surrounding\r\n  mould, it is peculiarly liable to damp. The floor is frequently\r\n  charged with animal matter thrown upon it by the inmates, and this\r\n  rapidly decomposes by the alternate action of heat and moisture.\r\n  Thatch placed in contact with such walls speedily decays, yielding a\r\n  gas of the most deleterious quality. Fever of every type and diarrhœa\r\n  are endemic diseases in the parish and neighbourhood. Next to good\r\n  drainage and thorough ventilation, the foundation of a cottage is the\r\n  most important consideration. A foundation, to be good, must not only\r\n  be sufficiently strong to bear the superstructure, and of sufficient\r\n  depth to cut off all connexion with the surrounding vegetable mould\r\n  and that beneath the floor, but also be constructed of materials\r\n  calculated to resist moisture. The best materials for this purpose are\r\n  concrete and sound bricks, partially vitrified in the kiln or clamp.\r\n  If such bricks be well laid with mortar composed of sharp sand,\r\n  containing no vegetable substances, and the concrete be free from\r\n  earthy particles, well mixed and firmly thrown together, the admission\r\n  of damp will be entirely avoided. Stone, chalk, bricks which are not\r\n  thoroughly burnt, impure mortar, and wood, have all a tendency to\r\n  absorb moisture, which, if once received by such materials, ascends,\r\n  or ‘creeps up,’ as it is technically called by builders, and thus\r\n  affects the whole building. To avoid this “creeping up,” builders are\r\n  in the habit of placing a tire of slate in foundations above the\r\n  surface mould, a remedy of a temporary character only, for the action\r\n  of damp entirely destroys slate. Roman cement has also been used for\r\n  this purpose, but the sand mixed with this material renders it in some\r\n  degree porous. It has lately been suggested that a course of\r\n  well-burnt bricks set in asphalte would effectually prevent this\r\n  absorption of surface-water, and a favourable opinion of this plan has\r\n  been expressed by two intelligent architects.”\r\n\r\nHe adds that—\r\n\r\n  “In Berkshire the floors of the cottages are laid with red tiles,\r\n  called ‘flats,’ or with bricks of a remarkable porous quality, and as\r\n  each of these tiles or bricks will absorb half a pint of water, so do\r\n  they become the means by which vapour is generated. The cleanly\r\n  housewife, who prides herself upon the neat and fresh appearance of\r\n  her cottage, pours several pails of water upon the floor, and when she\r\n  has completed her task with the besom, she proceeds to remove with a\r\n  mop or flannel so much of the water as the bricks have not absorbed.\r\n\r\n  “After having cleansed the cottage, the fire is usually made up to\r\n  prepare the evening meal, and vapour is created by the action of the\r\n  heat upon the saturated floor. Thus the means adopted to purify the\r\n  apartment are equally as injurious to the health of the inmates as the\r\n  filth and dirt frequently too abundant in the cottages of labouring\r\n  persons.\r\n\r\n  “It is usual to insert in local Acts for the regulation of towns a\r\n  clause prohibiting the use of straw and similar vegetable substances\r\n  for roofing; and it appears to me to be desirable that some provision\r\n  should be made for the rural districts, by which the thatch of\r\n  cottages, when in a decomposed state, might be required to be removed.\r\n  In the parishes of Binton, Dorsington, and Long Marston, in the\r\n  neighbourhood of Stratford-on-Avon, simple continued fever, described\r\n  to be similar in character to the form of fever which frequently\r\n  occurs in the autumn and beginning of winter throughout England,\r\n  prevailed very extensively in the winter of 1839. Of 31 patients\r\n  attacked by it, seven died. Dr. Thompson of Stratford-on-Avon, the\r\n  physician who visited all the cases by the desire of the Board of\r\n  Guardians of the Stratford-on-Avon union, observes:—‘As almost all the\r\n  cottages in which there has been fever are thatched, and the thatch in\r\n  many of them is in a very rotten and insufficient condition, it is not\r\n  improbable that slow decomposition in the thatch, from the unusual\r\n  quantities of rain which has fallen, may have been going on, and\r\n  contributed to the production and continuance of fever. It has been\r\n  observed by others, I believe, that it is more difficult to get rid of\r\n  fever in thatched than in slated cottages.’ Dr. Thompson also remarks,\r\n  that in thatched cottages it is not usual to ceil or plaster the\r\n  inside of the roof; and he recommends that this should be done, and\r\n  that the plaster should be lime-washed once a-year.”\r\n\r\nIn the course of some observations made on the construction of the\r\ncottages of the labouring classes in France, it is observed that—\r\n\r\n  “It is in vain that the workman breathes a pure air out of doors, if\r\n  on his return to his home he finds an infected atmosphere. Air, which\r\n  is so necessary to life and health, and which it is of the last\r\n  importance to renew often, especially in small rooms, remains thick\r\n  and loaded in the abode of the workman, because no currents can exist\r\n  in consequence of the window being almost always placed alongside the\r\n  door. The form of the chimney is another great evil in the\r\n  construction of country cottages. With a shaft very short and very\r\n  large, it is impossible for the room to get warm, and the heat\r\n  produced is almost entirely lost. This form of the chimneys is only\r\n  explicable by the ignorance of the constructors. However large a fire\r\n  may be required by the diverse needs of the family, it does not\r\n  involve the necessity to make the chimney shaft of a corresponding\r\n  size; on the contrary, the facility with which the smoke ascends is\r\n  altogether proportioned to the smallness of the latter, as may be seen\r\n  in the chimneys of stoves, which are always extremely narrow.”\r\n\r\nThe _Rev. C. Walkey_, of Collumpton, gives instances of the want of\r\nprovision for ventilation in the cottages of the labouring classes:—\r\n\r\n  “Cottages for the most part are without sufficient ventilation,\r\n  particularly in the up-stairs apartment, this being almost invariably\r\n  without a chimney, with a low window, commonly about two feet from the\r\n  floor, and having no ceiling, therefore the thatched roof, lofty in\r\n  itself, and full of cobwebs, contains the foul air; and in several\r\n  instances I have been the means of restoring health apparently by\r\n  blowing gunpowder in cases where fever has raged for months, the\r\n  ground-floors being often damp—very seldom above the level of the\r\n  land.”\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the Highland Society for the improvement of the\r\nmaterial condition of the labourer, especially on the subject of cottage\r\neconomy, appear to be extremely well directed. They have sought to make\r\nimprovements in detail, which are thus described in one of the reports\r\nof a committee appointed to inquire into the subject:—\r\n\r\n  “Medals have been offered by the society to proprietors for building\r\n  cottages of a good construction; and these medals are already in\r\n  demand. The subject was again brought forward by the Marquis of\r\n  Tweeddale, who filled the chair at the last general meeting; and\r\n  throughout the whole of Scotland it is attracting increasing\r\n  attention. The style of such buildings is everywhere improving, and\r\n  the measures of the society will make the country acquainted with the\r\n  best models. Still, without a considerable diminution of the expense,\r\n  the rapid introduction of a better system is hardly to be expected. To\r\n  that point, accordingly, the directors have turned their serious\r\n  attention.\r\n\r\n  “Their first object has been the improvement of the windows, which\r\n  always form one of the principal items of charge, and have been\r\n  generally one of the worst constructed parts of the building. In many\r\n  districts of the Highlands the huts of the peasantry have nothing of\r\n  the kind, nor are there tradesmen within reach from whom they can be\r\n  obtained; and even in many of the more improved parts of the country\r\n  the cottage windows are seldom large enough to admit a sufficiency of\r\n  light; they are almost never provided with the means of ventilation;\r\n  and in a few instances can they be repaired without applying to a\r\n  tradesman. This is always attended with considerable expense; and, in\r\n  remote situations, skilful workmen are hardly to be obtained on any\r\n  terms. Accordingly, when glass is broken, recourse is had to the most\r\n  unseemly substitutes. These may annoy the inmate at first, but he soon\r\n  becomes habituated to them; one eyesore prepares him for another, and\r\n  in a short time the same slovenliness and disorder spread over the\r\n  whole establishment.\r\n\r\n  “It appeared to the directors that much of this would be avoided if\r\n  the public could be made acquainted with the best description of a\r\n  cottage window. The demand would necessarily lead to their being\r\n  extensively manufactured, and consequently supplied at a moderate\r\n  price; and, what is of still more consequence, the general adoption of\r\n  such windows would lead to glass of the proper size being kept in\r\n  every village, and labourers would then be enabled to repair their own\r\n  windows. A premium was accordingly offered last year for the best\r\n  cottage window, not so much in the expectation of bringing forward\r\n  anything altogether new, as of enabling the directors to select the\r\n  best of the forms now in use.\r\n\r\n  “Various specimens were sent in. Some were made of zinc; but these\r\n  were rejected, on the advice of tradesmen, as being too weak to admit\r\n  of repair by an unpractised hand. Wood and lead are, for the same\r\n  reason, equally unsuitable. One was constructed with astragals of\r\n  malleable iron, so thin as very little to impede the light, and\r\n  consequently admitting of glass of a very small size; but the\r\n  astragals not being provided with flanges for the glass to rest upon,\r\n  the repair must necessarily be a work of some difficulty; and these\r\n  also were consequently deemed unfit for the purpose. Cast-iron appears\r\n  to be the material least liable to objection; but astragals of\r\n  cast-metal must be of considerable thickness; and such frames,\r\n  therefore, could not be adapted to a very small size of glass without\r\n  materially obscuring the light. It was made by Messrs. Moses M’Culloch\r\n  and Co., Gallowgate, Glasgow; and, without the wooden frame, it costs\r\n  5_s._ Glass for such a window may be purchased at 2¾_d._ per square.\r\n  These windows would appear adapted for farm-houses and workshops as\r\n  well as for cottages. They admit of being made of every variety of\r\n  size, and, in most cases, they may thus be fitted with ease to houses\r\n  already built. In many situations, it will thus deserve consideration\r\n  whether it may be better to repair the glass of old frames, or to\r\n  adopt windows of this construction, which may be purchased and kept up\r\n  at so very moderate an expense. It is understood that Messrs.\r\n  M’Cullock intend to establish agencies in all parts of the country,\r\n  and light and pure air will thus be supplied to the humbler classes\r\n  everywhere at a much cheaper rate than they have hitherto been\r\n  obtained.”\r\n\r\n  The directors have next turned their attention to the means of\r\n  economizing fuel; and a premium for the best mode of accomplishing\r\n  this will be found in the list of this year. It will be observed, that\r\n  the object of the premium is not to obtain plans merely from Scottish\r\n  tradesmen, but to ascertain the devices which are practised in foreign\r\n  countries. In America, and several of the continental states, it is\r\n  understood that stoves are generally used for this purpose, and some\r\n  of these are said to be so perfect that no one who has been accustomed\r\n  to them would tolerate the fire-places of the Scottish cottages. There\r\n  may be a difficulty in introducing a novelty of this kind here; but if\r\n  it should promise to be beneficial, it would be at least deserving of\r\n  a trial; and if it should be generally adopted, this also would become\r\n  the subject of an extensive manufacture, and be obtained at a cheap\r\n  rate.\r\n\r\n  “It appears to the committee, that still further facilities would be\r\n  afforded, both for the construction of new cottages and the\r\n  improvement of those already built, were doors, shelving, and the\r\n  other wooden work of the building manufactured in the same way as the\r\n  windows. The committee do not at present see any means of contributing\r\n  to the establishment of such works by the offer of premiums; but it\r\n  occurs to them that extensive proprietors might find it worth their\r\n  while to try the experiment, as an addition to the work of saw-mills.\r\n  If it should succeed with them, it could not fail in the hands of\r\n  tradesmen devoting their whole attention to the subject; and there\r\n  would be no want of men ready to embark in such undertakings. Should\r\n  an experiment of this kind be made, the committee hope that the\r\n  directors will be made acquainted with the result.\r\n\r\n  “Such a supply of the leading materials would not only greatly\r\n  facilitate the work of proprietors both in the erection of new\r\n  cottages and the improvement of old ones, but labourers who have the\r\n  prospect of being permanent tenants would likewise be induced, at\r\n  their own expense, to make improvements, which they would at present\r\n  find quite impracticable. As the reduction of the price of every\r\n  article of dress now enables the humblest labourer to appear\r\n  respectably clothed, so the reduction of the expense of so many of the\r\n  essentials in the construction of a house would bring comfortable\r\n  lodging equally within his reach.”\r\n\r\nTo the above-recited measures of the Highland Society, which are so well\r\ndirected to the improvement of the structure of cottages in the\r\nimportant points of economy as well as of efficiency, they have added\r\nprizes for the best-kept cottages and the best cottage gardens, which\r\nhave everywhere excited competition, and have been attended with\r\nbeneficial results.\r\n\r\nI have as yet met with no similar instance of attention given by large\r\nand influential public bodies, to the improvement of the residences of\r\nthe working-classes in towns. I have, however, been favoured with one\r\ncommunication from _Mr. Sydney Smirke_, the architect, who has had\r\nexperience in planning and superintending the erection of residences for\r\nthe men of the coast-guard service, and who, in some suggestions for the\r\nimprovement of the metropolis, has endeavoured to direct public\r\nattention to the improvement of the structure of the residences of the\r\nlabouring classes. He states that—\r\n\r\n  “The course that has been adopted by great manufacturers and others in\r\n  some rural districts, of erecting ranges of distinct cottages for\r\n  their labourers, is plainly inapplicable to large towns. If there were\r\n  no other obstacle to this arrangement, the value of land would alone\r\n  be fatal to it in such places; but my belief is that, without ultimate\r\n  pecuniary loss, and with the utmost direct and indirect benefit,\r\n  buildings, placed under some public control, might be erected for the\r\n  joint occupation of many families or individuals, and so arranged that\r\n  each tenant might feel that he had the exclusive enjoyment of a home\r\n  in the room or rooms which he occupied, and yet might partake, in\r\n  common with his neighbours, of many important comforts and advantages\r\n  now utterly unknown to him.\r\n\r\n  “I propose that there should be erected buildings, in various parts of\r\n  the suburbs, consisting of perhaps 50 or 60 rooms, high, airy, dry,\r\n  well ventilated, light and warm, comfortably filled up, fire-proof,\r\n  abundantly supplied with water and thoroughly drained; such\r\n  regulations might be laid down for the conduct of the inmates as may\r\n  be necessary for the common good, without undue rigour or interference\r\n  with natural and proper feelings of independence.\r\n\r\n  “Another class of structures should be raised, perhaps rather as\r\n  dormitories than for permanent residence, from which families would be\r\n  excluded; these should be arranged like some of the wards of Chelsea\r\n  Hospital, with separate compartments appropriated to each tenant.\r\n  Unlike the frail and worthless tenements that rise in great profusion\r\n  around London, these buildings should be studiously planned and\r\n  strongly constructed; all that the builder’s art can contribute\r\n  towards the safety, health, and comfort of each individual, should\r\n  here be found. In the former class of buildings, a room or rooms\r\n  should be let at a low weekly rent to any decent family that should\r\n  apply: in the latter, each compartment should be let by the night.\r\n\r\n  “The exterior of these locanda, or public lodging-houses, should have\r\n  a cheerful, inviting appearance, not entirely without architectural\r\n  character, although free, of course, from the mere ornament and\r\n  frippery of architecture.\r\n\r\n  “In throwing out these suggestions for such consideration as they may\r\n  deserve, it seems superfluous at present to trouble you with\r\n  explanatory plans and other details; it may be enough for me to assure\r\n  you that buildings can be erected, affording all the accommodations\r\n  above described, and offering to their inmates the luxury of a decent,\r\n  cleanly, and healthy abode, at a cost less than is usually required by\r\n  them for the purchase of the squalid resting-places they now resort\r\n  to, and yet enough to repay a fair interest on the original expense of\r\n  the new building.\r\n\r\n  “It may be said that in providing these commodious dwellings for their\r\n  needy inmates, we shall be furnishing them with that which they do not\r\n  desire; that habitual and long acquaintance with privation has taught\r\n  them to regard and to endure, without any lively distaste, much of\r\n  that misery from which others, more delicately educated, would shrink\r\n  with disgust; but I consider this objection quite unfounded. A tainted\r\n  atmosphere cannot be less injurious because by long habit it is\r\n  breathed without nausea. If these deplorable habits have really\r\n  acquired so much force, it should be our part to make corresponding\r\n  efforts to teach the victims of them to become more sensible of their\r\n  misery, not indeed by inculcating lessons of discontent, but by\r\n  affording to them facilities for providing themselves with healthier\r\n  and happier abodes.\r\n\r\n  “It is the true saying of an eloquent writer, that ‘les esclaves\r\n  perdent tout dans leur esclavage, jusqu’au désir d’en sortir;’ yet\r\n  surely no benevolent person would think himself idly or unprofitably\r\n  employed in loosing from bondage those whom long endurance has caused\r\n  to forget the blessings of freedom. I am, however, unwilling to\r\n  believe, even now, that the classes of whom I am speaking are\r\n  insensible to the comforts of cleanliness, or unable to appreciate the\r\n  benefit to be derived from improved habitations.\r\n\r\n  “I confess I cannot discover any objection to the adoption of such a\r\n  plan for ameliorating the dwellings of the poorest classes of our\r\n  fellow creatures that would not be counter-balanced by many direct and\r\n  indirect advantages.”\r\n\r\nI beg leave to submit this communication and the plans with which Mr.\r\nSmirke has favoured me, that it may be made known and considered. Much\r\nimportance will be attached to the testimony received from him as well\r\nas from other professional men, that it is possible to afford to the\r\nlabouring classes the luxury of “a decent, cleanly, and healthy abode at\r\na cost less than is usually required from them for the squalid\r\nresting-places they now resort to, and yet enough to repay a fair\r\ninterest on the original expense of the new building.”\r\n\r\nI see no reason to doubt the applicability of Mr. Smirke’s plan to such\r\nplaces as those where ranges of buildings are now required as lodgings\r\nfor workmen, and, without questioning the applicability of the\r\nproposition last cited, to all classes of residences. It is proper to\r\nmention, that in the course of this inquiry frequent instances have\r\narisen of much social disorder arising from the too close contiguity of\r\nresidences, or from the want of some control over the inmates. In the\r\ninstances noticed of lodging-houses, or of one building, inhabited by\r\ndifferent families, living as in the apartments of the same dwelling,\r\nthe conclusion afforded by experience seems to be, that a power and\r\ndiscipline almost as strong as that of a man-of-war, is requisite to\r\npreserve order in such communities; and that until a degree of education\r\nof the lower classes is attained, which is hopeless for the present,\r\ngeneration at least, it is desirable to avoid any arrangement which\r\nbrings _families_ into close contact with each other. A large proportion\r\nof the cases of assault and brawls which occupy the attention of the\r\npetty sessions and sessions in towns, arise from contentions amongst the\r\ninhabitants of courts and alleys, which are clearly ascribable to too\r\nclose contiguity; and these effects have frequently given rise to the\r\nsuggestion that if a city were rebuilt, the preservation of peace would\r\nbe much easier if such places were entirely removed and the inhabitants\r\nseparated. A common pump has gone far to furnish practice to a petty\r\nattorney. All the females wanted to use it at the same time, and\r\nperpetual quarrels and frequent assaults arose to get the first\r\nsupplies. Several attempts have been made by benevolent landlords to get\r\ntheir labourers to make use of common bakehouses, common wash-houses, to\r\njoin for one common brewing, and have offered them the use of utensils;\r\nbut they never could be got to agree upon it, and I have met with no\r\ninstance in which such plans have succeeded. Unless the walls of\r\ncontiguous cottages are very thick, detached cottages have social\r\ncomforts and moral advantages superior to those houses built in rows;\r\nand persons even of the middle class pay a higher rent for detached\r\ntenements for the sake of the comparative freedom which they allow from\r\ndisturbance by their neighbours. The information I received in Scotland\r\nrespecting the assemblages of single men, farm-servants, in houses\r\ncalled boothies, showed that the effect was also extremely unfavourable\r\nto their moral habits.\r\n\r\n                         SKETCH OF A PLAN FOR A\r\n\r\n                          PUBLIC LODGING HOUSE\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn some of the new towns in Germany it is considered advantageous, for\r\nthe sake of the circulation of air as well as for comfort and for\r\nsecurity against fire, to have each house detached by a small space from\r\nits neighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Effects of Public Walks and Gardens on the Health and Morals of the\r\n                   Lower Classes of the Population._\r\n\r\nWhilst separation rather than aggregation, more especially for families,\r\nis the course of policy suggested by experience for the places of\r\nresidence of the working-classes, accommodation is called for from every\r\npart of the country for public walks or places of recreation. The\r\ncommittee of physicians and surgeons of Birmingham state, in the course\r\nof their report on the sanitary condition of the population of that,\r\ntown:—\r\n\r\n  “The want of some place of recreation for the mechanic is an evil\r\n  which presses very heavily upon these people, and to which many of\r\n  their bad habits may be traced. There are no public walks in or near\r\n  this town; no places where the working-people can resort for\r\n  recreation. The consequence is that they frequent the ale-houses and\r\n  skittle-alleys for amusement. Within the last half century the town\r\n  was surrounded by land which was divided into gardens, which were\r\n  rented by the mechanic at one guinea or half a guinea per annum. Here\r\n  the mechanic was generally seen after his day’s labour spending his\r\n  evening in a healthy and simple occupation, in which he took great\r\n  delight. This ground is now for the most part built over, and the\r\n  mechanics of the town are gradually losing this source of useful and\r\n  healthy recreation.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mott_, in his report on the condition of the labouring population\r\nof his district, observes, in respect to that in Manchester—\r\n\r\n  “There are circumstances attending the local position of Manchester\r\n  which might be urged in palliation of some of the habits of the\r\n  working classes.\r\n\r\n  “There are no public walks or places of recreation by which the\r\n  thousands of labourers or families can relieve the tedium of their\r\n  monotonous employment. Pent up in a close, dusty atmosphere from\r\n  half-past five or six o’clock in the morning till seven or eight\r\n  o’clock at night, from week to week, without change, without\r\n  intermission, it is not to be wondered at that they fly to the spirit\r\n  and beer-shops, and the dancing-houses, on the Saturday nights to seek\r\n  those, to them, pleasures and comforts which their own destitute and\r\n  comfortless homes deny.\r\n\r\n  “Manchester is singularly destitute of those resources which conduce\r\n  at once to health and recreation. With a teeming population, literally\r\n  overflowing her boundaries, she has no public walks or resorts, either\r\n  for the youthful or the adult portion of the community to snatch an\r\n  hour’s enjoyment.\r\n\r\n  “The prospect of obtaining any wide area to be appropriated as a\r\n  public walk or otherwise for the use of the labouring classes, becomes\r\n  more remote each year, as the value of the land within and in the\r\n  neighbourhood of the town increases.”\r\n\r\nMr. Joseph Strutt, of Derby, has presented to that town a public garden\r\nof eleven acres, which has been so laid out by Mr. Loudon as to give the\r\nadvantages of a walk of two miles, and the interest afforded by an\r\narboretum, displaying the specimens of 1000 shrubs and plants. The plan\r\nof laying out this public ground so as to make the most of the space,\r\nappears to be one deserving of peculiar attention; and I have appended\r\nto this report a copy with which I have been favoured. I am informed\r\nthat his Grace the Duke of Norfolk has expressed an intention, as soon\r\nas some leases are out, to bestow 50 acres for the use of Sheffield as a\r\npublic garden.\r\n\r\nMuch evidence might be adduced from the experience of the effects of the\r\nparks and other places of public resort in the metropolis, to prove the\r\nimportance of such provision for recreation, not less for the pleasure\r\nthey afford in themselves, than for their rivalry to pleasures that are\r\nexpensive, demoralizing, and injurious to the health. A benevolent\r\ngentleman near Cambridge, who wished to arrest the debauchery and\r\ndemoralization promoted by a fair, and, if possible, to put an end to\r\nthe fair itself, instituted on the days when it was held, and at a\r\ndistance from it, a grand ploughing match, at which all persons of\r\nrespectability were invited to attend. This brought from the fair all\r\nthe young men whom it was desired to lead from it to a regulated and a\r\nrational and beneficial entertainment, and thus, without force and at a\r\nvery trivial expense, the fair was suppressed by the quiet mode of\r\ndrawing away its profit.\r\n\r\nOn the holiday given at Manchester in celebration of Her Majesty’s\r\nmarriage, extensive arrangements were made for holding a chartist\r\nmeeting, and for getting up what was called a demonstration of the\r\nworking classes, which greatly alarmed the municipal magistrates. Sir\r\nCharles Shaw, the Chief Commissioner of Police, induced the mayor to get\r\nthe Botanical Gardens, Zoological Gardens, and Museum of that town, and\r\nother institutions thrown open to the working classes at the hour they\r\nwere urgently invited to attend the chartist meeting. The mayor\r\nundertook to be personally answerable for any damage that occurred from\r\nthrowing open the gardens and institutions to the classes who had never\r\nbefore entered them. The effect, was that not more than 200 or 300\r\npeople attended the political meeting, which entirely failed, and\r\nscarcely 5_s._ worth of damage was done in the gardens or in the public\r\ninstitutions by the workpeople, who were highly pleased. A further\r\neffect produced was, that the charges before the police of drunkenness\r\nand riot were on that day less than the average of cases on ordinary\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nI have been informed of other instances of similar effects produced by\r\nthe spread of temperate pleasures on ordinary occasions, and their\r\nrivalry to habits of drunkenness and gross excitement, whether mental or\r\nsensual.\r\n\r\nBut want of open spaces for recreation is not confined to the town\r\npopulation. In the rural districts the children and young persons of the\r\nvillages have frequently no other places for recreation than the dusty\r\nroad before their houses or the narrow and dirty lanes, and accidents\r\nfrequently take place from the playing of children on the public\r\nhighways. If they go into the fields they are trespassers, and injure\r\nthe farmer. The want of proper spaces as play-grounds for children is\r\ndetrimental to the morals as well as to the health in the towns, and it\r\nprobably is so generally. The very scanty spaces which the children,\r\nboth of the middle and the lower classes, the ill as well as the\r\nrespectably educated, can obtain, force all into one company to the\r\ndetriment of the better children, for it is the rude and boisterous who\r\nobtain predominance. In the course of some investigations which I had\r\noccasion to make into the causes of juvenile delinquency, there appeared\r\nseveral cases of children of honest and industrious parents, who had\r\nbeen entrapped by boys of bad character; I inquired how the more\r\nrespectable children became acquainted with the depraved; when it was\r\nshown that in the present state of many crowded neighbourhoods all the\r\nchildren of a court or of a street were forced to play, if they had any\r\nplay whatsoever, on such scraps of ground as they could get, and all\r\nwere brought into acquaintanceship, and the range of influence of the\r\ndepraved was extended. The condition of the children in large districts\r\nwhere there are no squares, no gardens attached to the houses, and no\r\nplay-grounds even to their day-schools, and where they are of a\r\ncondition in life to be withheld from playing in the streets, is\r\npronounced to be a condition very injurious to their bodily development.\r\nThe progress of the evil in the rural districts has been, to some\r\nextent, arrested by a beneficent standing order of the House of Commons,\r\nthat all Enclosure Bills shall include provision for a reserve of land\r\nfor the public use for recreation. For children, however, the most\r\nimportant reservations would be those which could be made for\r\nplay-grounds in front of their homes, on plots where they may be under\r\nthe eye of their mothers or their neighbours. Where the cottages are\r\nnear a road, they should be some distance from it, with the gardens or\r\nplay-ground in front. The separate or distant play-grounds have many\r\ninconveniences besides their being out of sight; and where they are far\r\ndistant, they are comparatively useless. I have great pleasure in being\r\nenabled to testily that the instances are frequent where the regulated\r\nresort to private pleasure-grounds, and parks has been indulgently given\r\nfor the recreation of the labouring population.\r\n\r\nAmongst the instances of practical attention to the improvement of the\r\nphysical condition of labouring classes in the agricultural districts, I\r\nmay notice the following statement made to me by the late _Mr. Monck_ of\r\nColey House, Reading, who had bestowed much care upon the cottages on\r\nhis own estate. It comprehends the provision adverted to:—\r\n\r\n  “The care taken of these cottages and gardens,” said he, “afford an\r\n  excellent criterion of the character of the labourers. I have paid\r\n  especial attention to those labourers who have displayed cleanliness\r\n  and order; and I pay the most respect to those who have achieved a\r\n  situation of the greatest comfort, and keep themselves and their\r\n  houses cleanly, and their children tidy. Formerly the cottages were in\r\n  bad order, their pavements and windows were broken; I had them all\r\n  paved, and their windows glazed. I told the cottagers that I did not\r\n  like to see shabby, broken windows, with patches of paper and things\r\n  stuffed in, or broken pavements which they could not clean; and that I\r\n  disliked Irish filth and all Irish habits of living. I engaged, after\r\n  the cottages were thoroughly repaired, to pay 1_l._ a year for\r\n  repairing them. I undertook to make the repairs myself, and deduct the\r\n  expense from this 1_l._; but if no repairs were wanted, they were to\r\n  have the whole 1_l._ themselves. This course has, I find, formed\r\n  habits of care; and their cottages are now so well taken care of that\r\n  very little deduction is made annually from the 1_l._ Formerly they\r\n  used to chop wood carelessly on their pavements, and break them; now\r\n  they abstain from the practice, or do it in a careful manner, to avoid\r\n  losing the money. In the winter, I give them two score of fagots\r\n  towards their fuel. I have found that by this means I save my hedges\r\n  and fences, and am pecuniarily no loser, whilst pilfering habits are\r\n  repressed. Since the enclosures have been made, I think some place\r\n  should be provided for the exercise and recreation of the\r\n  working-classes, and especially for their children. I have set out\r\n  four acres at Oldworth as a play-ground for the children, or whoever\r\n  likes to play. They have now their cricket-matches, their\r\n  quoit-playing, and their revels there. Sheep and cows feed on it; so\r\n  that it is no great loss to me. I let it for 4_l._ a-year to a man, on\r\n  condition that he cuts the hedges and keeps it neat. I have surrounded\r\n  it with a double avenue of trees. The sheep and cows do good to the\r\n  ground, as they keep the grass under, which allows the ball to run. I\r\n  give prizes to the boys at the school, which is maintained by the\r\n  cottagers themselves, and to which I contribute nothing but the prizes\r\n  for reading, writing, and knitting.\r\n\r\n  “Many persons accuse the poor of ingratitude, but I find them the most\r\n  grateful people alive for these little attentions; and what do they\r\n  all cost me? why not more altogether than the keep of one fat\r\n  coach-horse.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.—RECOGNISED PRINCIPLES OF LEGISLATION AND STATE OF THE EXISTING LAW\r\n                FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evidence already given will, to some extent, have furnished answers\r\nto the question—how far the physical evils by which the health, and\r\nstrength, and morals of the labouring classes are depressed may be\r\nremoved, or can reasonably be expected to be removed by private and\r\nvoluntary exertions. I now submit for consideration the facts which\r\nserve to show how far the aid of the legislature, and of administrative\r\narrangements are requisite for the attainment of the objects in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nIt will have been perceived, that the first great remedies, external\r\narrangements, _i. e._ efficient drainage, sewerage and cleansing of\r\ntowns, come within the acknowledged province of the legislature. Public\r\nopinion has of late required legislative interference for the regulation\r\nof some points of the internal economy of certain places of work, and\r\nthe appointment of special agents to protect young children engaged in\r\ncertain classes of manufactures from mental deterioration from the\r\nprivation of the advantages of education, and from permanent bodily\r\ndeterioration from an excess of labour beyond their strength. Claims are\r\nnow before Parliament for an extension of the like remedies to other\r\nclasses of children and to young persons, who are deemed to be in the\r\nsame need of protection. The legislature has interfered to put an end to\r\none description of employment which was deemed afflicting and degrading,\r\ni. e. that of climbing-boys for sweeping chimneys, and to force a better\r\nmeans of performing by machinery the same work. It will be seen that it\r\nhas been the policy of the legislature to interfere for the public\r\nprotection by regulating the structure of private dwellings to prevent\r\nthe extension of fires; and the common law has also interposed to\r\nprotect the public health by preventing overcrowding in private\r\ntenements. The legislature has recently interfered to direct the poorer\r\ndescription of tenements in the metropolis to be properly cleansed. On\r\nconsidering the evidence before given with relation to the effects of\r\ndifferent, classes of buildings, the suggestion immediately arises as to\r\nthe extent to which it is practicable to protect the health of the\r\nlabouring classes by measures for the amendment of the existing\r\nbuildings, and for the regulation of new buildings in towns in the great\r\nproportion of cases where neither private benevolence nor enlightened\r\nviews can be expected to prevail extensively.\r\n\r\nIt will have been perceived how much of the existing evils originate\r\nfrom the defects of the external arrangements for drainage, and for\r\ncleansing, and for obtaining supplies of water. Until these are\r\ncompleted, therefore, the force of the evils arising from the\r\nconstruction of the houses could scarcely be ascertained.\r\n\r\nThe experience of legislation available for England for the regulation\r\nof buildings is chiefly confined to the Metropolitan Building Act. The\r\nprovisions of that Act were directed simply to the prevention of the\r\nspread of fires by requiring that party-walls should be built so as to\r\nprevent the spread of fires, by confining them to the houses where the\r\nfires occur. In this object it is in most instances successful. Wherever\r\na fire spreads beyond the single dwelling in the metropolis, it is\r\nusually found either that the provisions of the Act have been evaded,\r\nthe walls being of the required thickness but rotten in substance, or\r\nthat omissions have occurred from default of notice, or from neglect of\r\nthe district surveyor. Out of the jurisdiction of the Act, the instances\r\nare frequent where fires spread from the want of party-walls. The\r\nerection of party-walls is good economy as a matter of insurance, for\r\neach house is thereby confined to its own risks, instead of having the\r\nadditional risks of each of the contiguous houses, and perhaps of two or\r\nthree houses beyond them. If there were any point on which _à priori_\r\nlegislative interference might be thought unnecessary it would be this,\r\non which the self-interest of the parties, for their own protection,\r\nwould ensure attention. Yet the immediate interest of the builder in\r\ngetting buildings erected at the lowest cost, or the want of foresight\r\non the part of the owner himself, has caused extensive masses of\r\nbuildings to be run up in the suburbs of the metropolis, and in\r\nprovincial towns, without any such protection. Whilst this Report was in\r\npreparation I was informed of the destruction by fire of several\r\ncontiguous houses at Oxford that were without party-walls. But\r\nparty-walls are only one provision against fire; the omissions of other\r\nnecessary precautions are fearfully extensive, especially in warehouses\r\nand buildings of a magnitude too great for the fire to be restrained by\r\nparty-walls, or to prevent fire catching the adjacent buildings whenever\r\nit occurs.\r\n\r\nOne, however, I may advert to, as connected with the provisions\r\nnecessary for the improvement of the sanitary condition of a town\r\npopulation. It has been shown that the cheapest mode of street cleansing\r\nis by supplies of water, which it would be necessary to use from\r\nstanding pipes. By the Street Act, the parish officers are directed to\r\nprovide standing pipes for the supply of engines in case of fire. This\r\nregulation is declared to be almost a dead letter. The only means to\r\nobtain supplies of water in the case of fire are from the plugs provided\r\nby the water companies themselves for cleansing the pipes by\r\noccasionally allowing the water to flow into the streets. It has been\r\nproved to be practicable without any considerable cost to keep up, at\r\nall times, such a pressure of water as on putting on a hose on any\r\nstanding pipe connected with the service, to enable the water to be\r\nthrown over the highest houses. The fronts of houses in London have, in\r\nsome instances, been washed by this means, and in one instance it was\r\nimmediately and successfully applied to extinguish a fire. A large\r\nproportion of houses are destroyed or seriously injured before engines\r\ncan be brought to the spot or water obtained. During the last four years\r\nthe fires in London have been more than 600 per annum. If each fire on\r\nthe average incurred a loss of 500_l._, the total loss annually would\r\nexceed the total cost of the supplies of water for the whole of the\r\nmetropolis to the inhabitants, which, according to returns made to\r\nParliament in the year 1834, amounted to 276,200_l._ The superintendent\r\nof the police at Liverpool estimated the average loss by fires in that\r\ntown during eight years at a much greater amount before a better system\r\nof prevention was established. The cost of keeping the water always on\r\nin the mains is so inconsiderable that it was voluntarily proferred by a\r\ncompeting company in the metropolis, as an advantageous arrangement to\r\nsave the expense of water-tanks in private houses. I have high practical\r\nauthority for stating that the arrangement for keeping the water on the\r\nmains for street cleansing, for washing the footways as well as the\r\ncarriage-ways, and, when necessary, for washing the fronts of the\r\nhouses, would also serve, at an inconsiderable expense, as the most\r\nefficient means of extinguishing fires. Instead of the general loss of a\r\nconsiderable part of an hour’s time before intelligence can be\r\ndispatched and the distant fire-engines be got to the spot, in a few\r\nminutes, or as soon as the flexible pipe in daily use could be screwed\r\non the main, a supply of water as powerful as that from any engine might\r\nbe brought to bear upon the fire. An extensive saving of life and\r\nproperty, and of well-grounded alarm, might thus be added to the train\r\nof benefits derivable from systematised arrangements for the cleansing\r\nof towns and the prevention of epidemics.\r\n\r\nThe provisions of the old Building Acts afford no sanitary securities,\r\nbut in connexion with the provisions respecting sewerage they afford\r\nexamples of what would be the effect of any measure which shall be\r\neither unequally applied as to the jurisdiction, or unequally\r\nadministered.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the Board has several times been directed to the\r\nsickness prevalent amongst the working classes in various parts of the\r\nKensington union. Having had occasion to inquire into the subject, I\r\nfound that nearly all the illness occurred in premises run up by\r\ninferior speculating builders out of the jurisdiction of the commissions\r\nof sewers, or of the district surveyors; that they were built on\r\nundrained spots, with walls not more than one brick thick; and that the\r\nimmediate expenditure for protective or sanitary purposes had thus been\r\nextensively evaded. On carrying the inquiry further, it became apparent\r\nthat the limits of the jurisdiction of the commissioners of sewers, and\r\nthe limits of the jurisdiction of the district surveyors around the\r\nmetropolis, mark the commencement of buildings of an inferior character,\r\nbuilt without drains, without the security from party-walls, and without\r\nproper means of cleansing. (_Vide_ Appendix, the evidence of Mr. Gutch,\r\ndistrict surveyor.) Under the peculiar circumstances of the country,\r\ntowns may arise and the old evils may be implanted before any old\r\ndistrict would probably be taken to include them. For example, the town\r\nof Old Kingston is tolerably well drained and healthy; on the completion\r\nof the railway a new town was suddenly run up by building speculators,\r\ncalled New Kingston, built out of the jurisdiction of Old Kingston, but\r\nwithout any adequate under-drainage, on a soil retentive of moisture,\r\nand with streets unpaved and covered with mud; it is reported as a\r\nconsequence that fever has been rife in New Kingston, whilst Old\r\nKingston is comparatively free from it.\r\n\r\nIf any one had to erect forty or fifty fourth-rate tenements near the\r\nmetropolis, by shifting them beyond the limits of the jurisdiction of\r\nthe district surveyor, he would nearly gain one house by the saving of\r\nfees alone in the ordinary mode of remunerating such officers.\r\n\r\nAll the information as to the actual condition of the most crowded\r\ndistricts is corroborative of the apprehensions entertained by witnesses\r\nof practical experience, such as Mr. Thomas Cubitt and other builders,\r\nwho are favourable to measures for the improvement of the condition of\r\nthe labouring classes, that anything of the nature of a Building Act\r\nthat is not equally and skillfully administered will aggravate the evils\r\nintended to be remedied. To whatever districts regulations are confined,\r\nthe effect proved to be likely to follow will be, that the builder of\r\ntenements which stand most in need of regulation will be driven over the\r\nboundary, and will run up his habitations before measures can be taken\r\nto include them. The condition of the workman will be aggravated by the\r\nincreased fatigue and exposure to weather in traversing greater\r\ndistances to sleep in a badly-built, thin, and damp house. An increase\r\nof distance from his place of work will have the more serious effect\r\nupon his habits by rendering it impracticable to take his dinner with\r\nhis family, compelling him either to take it in some shed or at the beer\r\nshop. It is also apprehended that anything that may be done to increase\r\nunnecessarily or seriously the cost of new buildings, or discourage\r\ntheir erection, will aggravate the horrors of the overcrowding of the\r\nolder tenements; at the same time, the certain effect of an immediate\r\nand unprepared dislodgement of a cellar population, would be to\r\novercrowd the upper portions of the houses where they reside. It would\r\nindeed often be practicable to make those cellars as habitable as are\r\nthe cellars inhabited by servants in the houses of the middle and higher\r\nclasses of society. The difficulties which beset such regulations do not\r\narise from the want of means to pay any necessary increase of rents for\r\nincreased accommodation, but in the very habits which afford evidence of\r\nthe existence of the sufficiency of the means of payment.\r\n\r\nFor practical legislation on the subject of increased charges on\r\ntenements, the labourers must be considered to be in a state of penury,\r\nand ready to shift from bad to worse for the avoidance of the slightest\r\ncharges, and therefore to be approached with the greatest caution.\r\n\r\nBut there are other elements which it is proper to note as increasing\r\nthe tendency to evade immediate charges even for benefits.\r\n\r\nThe increasing tendency to carry on manufacturing as well as commercial\r\noperations for small profits on large outlays will probably occasion the\r\nsubject of the rents of labourers’ tenements in manufacturing districts\r\nto be more closely considered as part of the cost of production than it\r\nhas hitherto been. The whole of the consequences cannot distinctly be\r\nforeseen, further than that it will probably occasion a reduction of\r\nhigh ground-rents, or the abandonment of particular districts which are\r\nnow the seats of some descriptions of manufacture. In the course of an\r\nexamination of the condition of the working population of Macclesfield,\r\nwhich I was requested to aid, it was complained that much work was put\r\nout to a rural district at a few miles distance from the town. On\r\ninquiring as to the cause, it was answered, that the weavers in the\r\nrural district were enabled to do the work at a reduced price, but at\r\nthe same real wages in consequence of reduced rents. The following\r\nexamination, however, displays the element indicated:—\r\n\r\n_Mr. Shatwell_, relieving officer, examined—\r\n\r\n  “What is the common amount of rent paid by weavers in Macclesfield and\r\n  the adjacent districts?—A weaver cannot get, in Macclesfield, a proper\r\n  house for his loom, with due lights, for less than 10_l._ a-year. In\r\n  Hazel Grove and other places, he may get them for 2_l._ or 3_l._\r\n  less—for about 7_l._—with a small garden attached, worth at least\r\n  20_s._ a-year more.\r\n\r\n  “What difference in price do you think would induce a manufacturer to\r\n  send goods to Hazel Grove in preference to Macclesfield?—A farthing a\r\n  yard, as that difference might make the difference in his profit.\r\n\r\n  “How many yards will a weaver weave in the week?—They calculate that a\r\n  good weaver will weave 12 yards a-day, or an average of 60 yards\r\n  a-week.\r\n\r\n  “Since 1_s._ 3_d._ a-week, or a farthing a yard, will make the\r\n  difference in profit, will not the difference in rent enable the\r\n  weaver to make that difference in price and yet obtain the same net\r\n  amount of wages?—Precisely so.\r\n\r\n  “So that a manufacturer who employs 1000 hands at a low-rented place,\r\n  3_l._ or 4_l._ a-year cheaper, such as Hazel Grove, if he obtain the\r\n  difference of rent as profit, will obtain a profit of 3,000_l._ or\r\n  4,000_l._ per annum?—Certainly.\r\n\r\n  “The cost of building and building materials being nearly the same in\r\n  Macclesfield and such a place as Hazel Grove, does not the difference\r\n  in rent consist chiefly in the difference of ground-rent?—Yes.”\r\n\r\nIf in all instances, as in the last, better as well as cheaper\r\nresidences, with gardens attached, were likely to be the result of the\r\ncommercial operation to the workmen, the change were, of course, to be\r\ndesired. But it is to be feared that it may often be otherwise than a\r\ncompetition of comforts, unless timely security be taken against its\r\nbeing otherwise by appropriate legislative measures, which indeed were\r\nnecessary for the due protection of the ratepayers against the pecuniary\r\nconsequences of the disease and destitution undoubtedly occasioned by\r\nsuch tenements as are thus described by _Mr. Mott_:—\r\n\r\n  “An immense number of the small houses occupied by the poorer classes\r\n  in the suburbs of Manchester are of the most superficial character;\r\n  they are built by the members of building clubs, and other\r\n  individuals, and new cottages are erected with a rapidity that\r\n  astonishes persons who are unacquainted with their flimsy structure.\r\n  They have certainly avoided the objectionable mode of forming\r\n  underground dwellings, but have run into the opposite extreme, having\r\n  neither cellar nor foundation. The walls are only half brick thick, or\r\n  what the bricklayers call ‘brick noggin,’ and the whole of the\r\n  materials are slight and unfit for the purpose. I have been told of a\r\n  man who had built a row of these houses; and on visiting them one\r\n  morning after a storm, found the whole of them levelled with the\r\n  ground; and in another part of Manchester, a place with houses even of\r\n  a better order has obtained the appellation of ‘Pickpocket-row,’ from\r\n  the known insecure and unsubstantial nature of the buildings. I\r\n  recollect a bricklayer near London complaining loudly of having to\r\n  risk his credit by building a house with nine-inch walls, and declared\r\n  it would be like ‘Jack Straw’s House,’ neither ‘wind nor water tight:’\r\n  his astonishment would have been great had he been told that thousands\r\n  of houses occupied by the labouring classes are erected with walls of\r\n  4½ inch thickness. The chief rents differ materially according to the\r\n  situation, but are in all cases high; and thus arises the inducement\r\n  to pack the houses so close. They are built back to back, without\r\n  ventilation or drainage; and, like a honeycomb, every particle of\r\n  space is occupied. Double rows of these houses form courts, with,\r\n  perhaps, a pump at one end and a privy at the other, common to the\r\n  occupants of about twenty houses.”\r\n\r\nWhilst there is the new element of this extreme rapidity of construction\r\nto accommodate demands for labour, the increasing rapidity of the\r\nconveyance of goods and information is manifestly loosening the ties of\r\nthe manufacturer to particular neighbourhoods. Whilst looms have been\r\nidle in Spitalfields on disputes on scale-prices, or from hesitation as\r\nto comply with the requisite changes of modes of working, I am informed\r\nthat large quantities of work have been taken away, executed in the new\r\nneighbourhoods, and returned at reduced prices to the London markets. In\r\nthe instance of Macclesfield, it is shown that neither foresight nor\r\nconsiderations of the expediency of a reduction operates on the\r\nspeculating owners of tenements occupied by workmen in towns, or even on\r\nthe other ratepayers, (who bear the burdens of the sickness and\r\nmortality, and pay extravagant rates, which are incident to them); nor\r\ncan the operation of a wise self-interest be relied upon to avert the\r\ntendency to the dispersion of work, and the multiplication of\r\nill-conditioned and ultimately burdensome tenements. The following\r\nevidence supplies additional illustration of this state of things:—\r\n\r\n_John Wilson_, relieving officer.\r\n\r\n  Are you acquainted with the cottage property in Macclesfield?—Yes, I\r\n  am; as an assistant overseer, I see that the rates are collected.\r\n\r\n  Are there in Macclesfield many large owners of cottage tenements?—The\r\n  number of owners of property in Macclesfield is about 1000; of these\r\n  about 300 receive incomes from cottage property, some of those only\r\n  one, others only two. The chief owner owns about 200 cottages; the\r\n  next owns about two streets or 45 cottages. One man owns about 180.\r\n\r\n  Do you receive rates from these cottages?—From the cottages belonging\r\n  to these large holders we get no rates.\r\n\r\n  How is it that you obtain no rates from these classes of\r\n  cottages?—Because they are tenanted by the lowest class of persons who\r\n  have nothing in their houses from which we could recover the rates.\r\n\r\n  What are the rents paid from these cottages?—The rents vary from 1_s._\r\n  to 2_s._ 8_d._ each house. The average would be about 2_s._ a-week.\r\n\r\n  What would be the amount of rates on this cottage property if payment\r\n  were enforced?—From the 1_s._ a-week cottages the rates would be 6_s._\r\n  per annum; from the others, 12_s._ per annum. Last quarter there were\r\n  nearly 300 people excused; and the total amount lost for rates excused\r\n  and houses empty was 900_l._\r\n\r\n  What proportion does that bear to the whole rates for the quarter or\r\n  for the year?—The loss for the year would be 1800_l._, and the rate\r\n  last year was 8726_l._; the amount collected was 5900_l._; but the\r\n  arrear of the former year would be in round numbers about 2000_l._\r\n  more.\r\n\r\n  Is the tenantry of these cottages a fluctuating tenantry?—Yes, very\r\n  much so.\r\n\r\n  Are these tenements taken on the expectation that the rates will be\r\n  excused?—Yes; in many cases they are told when objecting to the\r\n  payment of the rent that they will have no rates to pay.\r\n\r\n  Considering the qualities of the tenements, are the rents charged\r\n  really high rents?—Yes, they are.\r\n\r\n  Are they such rents, as would justify the levy or the deduction of\r\n  rates from the proprietor, comparing them with the rents paid for good\r\n  property?—Yes, they are such rents; the house which I live in, and for\r\n  which I pay rates, and pay 8_l._ a-year rent, is a house of three\r\n  rooms on a floor, two floors, detached yard, and every convenience;\r\n  whilst cottages of a very inferior description, with two rooms only on\r\n  a floor, are as high rented and pay no rates.\r\n\r\n  Are the rents from the inferior tenements rigorously exacted?—Yes,\r\n  they are.\r\n\r\n  Are the occupants of these houses frequently applicants for parochial\r\n  relief?—Yes, they are.\r\n\r\n  Do any numbers of them receive relief?—Yes, they do.\r\n\r\n  What is the average amount of weekly out-door relief given to the\r\n  recipients?—Perhaps about 3_s._\r\n\r\n  Then the average relief is of the average amount of the rent of the\r\n  tenements you describe?—Yes; and I have no doubt that much of the\r\n  relief has gone to pay rent.\r\n\r\n  If the rates were duly exacted, do you think it must follow that the\r\n  unduly high rents must be lowered in proportion?—Yes, they must.\r\n\r\n  If the landlords were compelled to pay the rates, what would be the\r\n  saving to the town?—1_s._ in the pound.\r\n\r\n  And no additional burden cast on the labouring classes?—No material\r\n  additional burden.\r\n\r\n  Of course the diminution of out-door relief would diminish the means\r\n  of unduly paying high rents?—Certainly, it would.\r\n\r\nThe sanitary condition of many of these dwellings is described in the\r\nreports of Mr. Bland, the medical officer already quoted.\r\n\r\nIt may hereafter excite surprise, that the labouring classes have\r\nhitherto been left exposed to such influences as those described in the\r\nlast evidence, and in the evidence previously cited, as to the\r\npernicious operation of exemptions from payments of rates on the parties\r\nintended to be benefited.\r\n\r\nMy inquiries into the effects of the administration of the old poor law\r\nbrought before me numerous instances of such devastation, the effects of\r\nwhich would not be obliterated during the lives of a generation.\r\nExamples might also be presented of the deterioration of property by the\r\nirruptions of an ill-regulated population by the running up of undrained\r\nand badly-constructed dwellings in the finest suburbs of the metropolis,\r\nand other towns throughout the country. Any regulations of the nature of\r\nBuilding Acts confined to towns, or to particular districts, or that\r\nwere unequally or oppressively administered, must powerfully tend to\r\nincrease such evils to the labouring classes, to the ratepayers, and to\r\nthe owners of all suburban property.\r\n\r\nFrequent opportunities are, however, presented and commonly lost for the\r\nerection of improved tenements for the use of the labouring classes, on\r\nthe occasion of taking down old tenements and erecting new ones to form\r\nnew streets, under the authority of Buildings’ and Towns’ Improvement\r\nActs. It is usually assumed that the general effect of the “clearances,”\r\nas they are called, occasioned by the formation of new streets, though\r\nattended with the present inconvenience of disturbing the occupants, is\r\nultimately of unmixed advantage, by driving them into new and better\r\ntenements in the suburbs. I have endeavoured to ascertain by inquiries,\r\nwith the aid of the relieving officers, how far the assumption is\r\njustified by the experience of such alterations as have been already\r\nmade in some of the crowded districts of the metropolis, by taking down\r\ninferior tenements to form new streets.\r\n\r\nIt is found to be difficult to trace the individuals of a population so\r\nremoved, and the inquiries on the subject are incomplete; but they tend\r\nto show that the working people make considerable sacrifices to avoid\r\nbeing driven to a distance from their places of work; that the poorest\r\nstruggle against removal to a distance from the opportunities of\r\ncharitable donations; and that where new habitations are not opened to\r\nthem in the immediate vicinity, every effort is made by biddings of rent\r\nto gain lodgings in the nearest and poorest of the old tenements. To the\r\nextent to which the displaced labourers succeed in getting lodgings in\r\nthe same neighbourhood, as a large proportion of them certainly do, the\r\nexisting evils are merely shifted, and, by being shifted, they are\r\naggravated. On a survey of the newly-built houses in the suburbs to\r\nwhich displaced labourers can go, it appears that the labourer, to use\r\nthe expression of Dr. Ferriar, is almost “driven to hire disease,” for\r\nif he do not find any lodging near his place of work, he is driven to a\r\nchoice amongst tenements of the character of those found in the parts of\r\nKensington out of the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Building Act,\r\nwithout sewers or drains, without water or proper conveniences on the\r\npremises, without pavements or means of cleansing the streets; where\r\nexorbitant rents are levied, where adequate means of moral or religious\r\ninstruction are yet unprovided, and where they will neither gain in\r\nhealth nor in morals.\r\n\r\nOn reference to such past experience it appears to suggest itself as an\r\nexpedient arrangement, that on the removal of old tenements and the\r\noccupation of the old ground by building new houses and streets for a\r\nsuperior class of tenants, or for public buildings, some provision\r\nshould be made against the aggravation of the existing evils as respects\r\nthe old occupants; that it should be required to be shown, for example,\r\nthat appropriate unoccupied tenements are in the market, and on failure\r\nto do so, provisions might be made (on the principle of those provided\r\nfor preserving accommodation for the labouring classes in enclosure\r\nbills) for the construction of appropriate tenements, in which qualities\r\nof the nature of those described by Mr. Sydney Smirke might be ensured.\r\nIf the attention and power by which large public alterations are\r\nobtained were, at the same time, directed to the construction of new\r\ndwellings for the labouring classes, instead of spreading existing\r\nevils, all such alterations might certainly, and at remunerative though\r\nnot at increased rents, be made the means of greatly improving the\r\ncondition of those who stand in the greatest need of attention and aid\r\nfor improvement.\r\n\r\nThe most important immediate general measure of the nature of a Building\r\nAct, subsidiary to measures for drainage, would be a measure for\r\nregulating the increments of towns, and preventing the continued\r\nreproduction in new districts of the evils which have depressed the\r\nhealth and the condition of whole generations in the older districts.\r\nRegulations of the _sites_ of town buildings have comparatively little\r\neffect on the cost of construction, and it may in general be said that a\r\nBuilding Act would effect what any enlightened owner of a district would\r\neffect for himself, of laying it out with a view to the most permanent\r\nadvantage; or what the separate owners would effect for themselves if\r\nthey had the power of co-operation, or if each piece of work were\r\ngoverned by enlarged public and private views. Had Sir Christopher Wren\r\nbeen permitted to carry out his plan for the rebuilding of London after\r\nthe great fire, there is little doubt that it would have been the most\r\nadvantageous arrangement for rendering the whole space more productive,\r\nas a property to the great mass of the separate interests, by whom the\r\nimprovement was defeated. The most successful improvements effected in\r\nthe metropolis by opening new lines of street, and the greater number of\r\nthe openings projected are approximations at an enormous expense to the\r\nplan which he laid down. The larger towns present instances of\r\nobstructions of the free current of air even through the principal\r\nstreets, and of deteriorations which a little foresight and the exercise\r\nof an impartial authority would have prevented. In one increasing town,\r\na builder made a successful money speculation by purchasing such plots\r\nof ground as would enable him to erect impediments and extort\r\ncompensation for their removal from the path of improvements in\r\nbuilding. The improvements affecting whole towns are also frequently\r\nfrustrated by the active jealousies of the occupants of rival streets.\r\nIt would appear to be possible to provide an impartial authority to\r\nobtain and, on consultation with the parties locally interested, to\r\nsettle plans for regulating the future growth of towns, by laying down\r\nthe most advantageous lines for occupation with due protection of the\r\nlandowners’ interest. The most serious omissions in the building of\r\ncommon houses are so frequently oversights as to make it probable, that\r\nif it were required that a plan of any proposed building should be\r\ndeposited with a trustworthy officer, with a specification of the\r\narrangements intended for the attainment of the essential objects, such\r\nas cleansing and ventilation, the mere preparation of the document would\r\nof itself frequently lead to the detection of grievous defects. An\r\nexamination of Mr. Loudon’s specification of the requisites of cottages\r\nwill show that a large proportion of the most important of these are\r\nindependent of the cost of construction.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _General State of the Law for the Protection of the Public Health._\r\n\r\nIn a work which is considered in Germany the chief authority in respect\r\nto the extensive administrative duties comprehended under the term\r\npolice,[41] the author, Professor Mohl, of Tubingen, in speaking of the\r\nsanitary police of towns, observes, that “Medical police is both in\r\ntheory and practice essentially German. In German states only, as\r\nAustria and Prussia, has anything been done in it systematically; the\r\nliterature also of medical police is almost entirely German. Other\r\nstates either do nothing at all, as England, the United States of\r\nAmerica, or only very imperfectly, as France; where anything is done,\r\nGerman principles and arrangements are closely imitated.”\r\n\r\nIt is stated that some of the new towns and the new parts of the old\r\ntowns in Germany, as in Stuttgard, Manheim, Darmstadt, exhibit striking\r\nmarks of this care in the comparative structure and arrangements of the\r\nhouses, and in the general administration, with a view to the health and\r\npleasure of the population, which is sometimes impressively displayed in\r\nthe superior condition of the public walks and gardens, as at Frankfort\r\nand Baden-Baden. The professor’s reproach is, however, scarcely\r\napplicable to the substantive English law, or to the early\r\nconstitutional arrangements in which are found extensive and useful\r\nprovisions, and complete principles for the protection of the public\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\n1st. So much of the structural arrangements as depended on drainage was\r\nprovided for by the Commissions of Sewers, who were invested with\r\nvaluable powers by the statute 23d Hen. VIII, cap. 5, s. 1; the\r\nauthority of these Commissions “to be directed into all parts within\r\nthis realm where need shall require, according to the form ensuing, to\r\nsuch substantial persons as shall be named by the Lord Chancellor and\r\nLord Treasurer, and the two chief justices, or by three of them, whereof\r\nthe Lord Chancellor to be one,” to cause “to be made, corrected or\r\nrepaired, amended, put down or reformed, as the case shall require,\r\nwalls, ditches, banks, gutters, sewers, gates, cullices, bridges,\r\nstreams, and other defences by the coasts of the sea and marsh ground.”\r\n\r\n2dly. The ancillary arrangements as to road cleansing as well as road\r\nstructure, were provided for by the highway laws, including the\r\nprovisions of the 5th Eliz. c. 13, s. 7, for the cleansing of the\r\nditches, &c.\r\n\r\nThe common law provided general remedies for the redress of injuries,\r\nunder the comprehensive title nuisance (_nocumentum_), meaning anything\r\nby which the health or the personal safety, or the conveniences of the\r\nsubject might be endangered or affected injuriously. By the law as it\r\nnow stands, the subject is entitled to protection against things which\r\nare offensive to the senses, from which no injury to the health or other\r\ninjury can be proved than the often overlooked but serious injury of\r\ndiscomfort, of daily annoyance, as by matters offensive to the sight, as\r\nby allowing blood to flow in the streets; by filth, by offensive smells,\r\nand by noises. The injuries termed nuisances were threefold,—first,\r\npublic or general; second, common; third, private. “Public is that which\r\nis a nuisance to the whole realm; common is that which is to the common\r\nnuisance of all passing by; private is that which is to a house or mill,\r\n&c.” 2 Institute, 406. A common nuisance is defined to be an offence\r\nagainst the public “either by doing a thing which tends to the annoyance\r\nof all the king’s subjects, or by neglecting to do a thing which the\r\ncommon good requires.” Hawk, p. 1. c. 107, c. 75, f. 1. For the private\r\ninjury there was the remedy by civil action; for the common and the\r\npublic injuries, the remedy was by indictment.\r\n\r\nThe common-law obligation upon all owners of property has, in general,\r\nbeen adhered to by the superior courts. “_Prohibetur ne quis faciet in\r\nsuo quod nocere possit alieno; et sic utere tuo ut alienum non lædas._”\r\n9 Co. Rep. 58.\r\n\r\nThus, it is held to be a common nuisance and indictable to divide a\r\nmessuage in a town for poor people to inhabit, by which it will be more\r\ndangerous in time of infection. 2 Roll’s Abridgment, 139. Such\r\nindictment of one Brown for dividing a messuage in the village of\r\nHertford was held good, and he was put to plead to it; and it was then\r\nsaid that such indictments are frequent in London for dividing of\r\nmessuages.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the common law was endeavoured to be enforced by the\r\nstatute of the 31st of Eliz. c. 7, which provided that there should not\r\nbe any inmate or more families or households than one dwelling or\r\ninhabiting in any one cottage, made or to be made or created, upon pain\r\nthat every owner or occupier of such cottage, placing or wilfully\r\nsuffering any such inmate or other family than one, should forfeit\r\n10_s._ for every month that such inmate or other family than one should\r\ndwell in it. The statute provided that no cottage should for the future\r\nbe built without four acres at the least of land attached to it. But\r\nthis provision did not extend to cottages in towns, or for mineral\r\nworks, navigation, sheep cotes, &.c. From the number of decisions in the\r\nbooks, it would appear that the provisions of the statute were\r\nextensively enforced against the overcrowding of the tenements, but the\r\nobligation for attaching the four acres of land impeded the erection of\r\nnew tenements, and occasioned inconvenience and led to the repeal of the\r\nwhole statute, by the 15th Geo. III. cap. 32.\r\n\r\nIn a temporary Act passed in the 35th of Eliz. cap. c., for the\r\nreforming of the great mischiefs and inconveniences that “daily grow and\r\nincrease by reason of the pestering of houses with divers families\r\nharbouring of inmates,” that occurred in the city of London and\r\nWestminster, it is recited that the practice had been productive of\r\n“great infection of sickness.” This effect could scarcely have failed to\r\nbe perceived when the plague was so frequent and dreadful in its\r\nvisitations. The exemption from it is ascribed to such widening of the\r\nstreets and improvements of the houses as took place after the Fire of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nBut we apprehend that the common-law remedy still remains in force as\r\nagainst the owners of tenements which are a nuisance. It was decided in\r\nthe case of the King _v._ Pedley, temp. 1834, 1st Adolphus and Ellis,\r\n822:—\r\n\r\n“That if the owner of land erect a building which is a nuisance, or of\r\nwhich the occupation is likely to produce a nuisance, and let the land,\r\nhe is liable to an indictment for such nuisance being continued or\r\ncreated during the term.\r\n\r\n“So he is if he let a building which requires particular care to prevent\r\nthe occupation from being a nuisance, and the nuisance occur for want of\r\nsuch care on the part of the tenant.\r\n\r\n“That if a party buy the reversion during a tenancy, and the tenant\r\nafterwards during his term erect a nuisance, the reversioner is not\r\nliable for it; but if such reversioner relet, or having an opportunity\r\nto determine the tenancy omit to do so, allowing the nuisance to\r\ncontinue, he is liable for such continuance. Per Littledale, J.\r\n\r\n“And such purchaser is liable to be indicted for the continuing of the\r\nnuisance if the original reversioner would have been liable, though the\r\npurchaser has had no opportunity of putting an end to the tenant’s\r\ninterest or abating the nuisance.”\r\n\r\nThe stopping of wholesome air is held to be a nuisance as well as the\r\nstopping of the light. Co. 9 Will., Aldred, 57. In the case of Lewes\r\n_v._ Keene, Trin. Term. Jac. Rex, it was held by the court—“that the\r\nlight which cometh in by the windowes, being an essential part of the\r\nhouse, by which he hath three great commodities, that is to say, air for\r\nhis health, light for his profit, prospect for his pleasure, may not be\r\ntaken away no more than a part of his house may be pulled down, whereby\r\nto erect the next house adjoining. And with this resolution agreeth the\r\ncase of Eldred, reported by Sir Edw. Coke, in his Ninth Report, fol. 58,\r\nwhere he showeth the ancient form of the action upon the case to be\r\n_quod messuagium horrida tenebritate obscuratum facit_; but if there be\r\nhinderance only of the prospect by the new erected house, and not of the\r\nair, not of the light, then an action of the case will not lye, insomuch\r\nthat the prospect is only a matter of delight, and not of necessity.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe corruption of the water is an offence at common law, and was early\r\nthe subject of a statutory provision. In the earlier periods the power\r\nof the legislature was directly exercised for the abatement of\r\nnuisances. I am favoured by the following illustrations from a\r\ncollection of records upon the subject made by _Mr. T. D. Hardy_, of the\r\nRecord Office in the Tower:—\r\n\r\nThe first extract shows that sea-coal was in use in London much earlier\r\nthan is commonly supposed:—\r\n\r\n  “_Patent Roll_, 16 Edw. 1.—The king to his beloved and faithful Thomas\r\n  de Weylaund, John de Luvetot, John de Cobeham, and Ralph de Sandwico,\r\n  custos of his city of London, greeting: From the complaint of many\r\n  persons, we understand that many people are dangerously aggrieved by\r\n  the furnaces of lime which are built in the said city and its suburbs,\r\n  and in Southwark; because the lime which formerly used to be burnt\r\n  with wood, is now burnt with sea coal, by which the air there is\r\n  affected and corrupted, to the great danger of persons frequenting\r\n  those parts and dwelling around them: we, therefore, being willing to\r\n  afford a fitting remedy for this, have appointed you to see those\r\n  furnaces, and remove the danger and nuisances which threaten from them\r\n  in these days, and to order further concerning them according to your\r\n  discretion, as you shall see most expedient for the common use and\r\n  safety; and therefore we command you, that taking with you our\r\n  sheriffs of London and our bailiffs of Southwark, you perform the\r\n  premises with diligence. We have also commanded the same sheriffs and\r\n  bailiffs that at a certain day, which you shall make known to them,\r\n  they attend to this with you, in form aforesaid. Witness, Edmund Earl\r\n  of Cornwall, at Westminster, on the 26th day of May.”\r\n\r\n  “A.D. 1290, 18 Edw. I.—The Carmelite Friars of London, the\r\n  Friars-preachers, the Bishop of Salisbury, and others, petition\r\n  Parliament to abate a nuisance (viz. a great stench) near them which\r\n  they cannot endure, and which prevents them from performing their\r\n  religious duties, and from which several of the monks had died.\r\n  (Petit, in Parl. 18 Edw. I.)\r\n\r\n  “35 Edw. I.—The mayor of London is commanded to prevent persons from\r\n  lighting furnaces near the Tower of London during the stay of the\r\n  Queen and the nobles at the tower, because the air is corrupted and\r\n  infection generated by the insalubrity of the air on account of the\r\n  said furnaces. (Rot. claus. 35 Edw. I.)\r\n\r\n  “A.D. 1320, 14 Edw. II.—The inhabitants of the neighbourhood of\r\n  Smithfield complain to Parliament that wells and ditches are dug there\r\n  without the king’s license, to the annoyance of the inhabitants and\r\n  passengers. The mayor and corporation of London are thereupon ordered\r\n  to see that such nuisances are abated. (Petit, in Parl. 14 Edw. II.)\r\n\r\n  “A.D. 1330, 4 Edw. III.—The chancellor and University of Cambridge\r\n  petition Parliament that the mayor and corporation of Cambridge may be\r\n  constrained to scour the ditch of the town, which is injurious to the\r\n  health of the inhabitants of the town. (Petit, in Parl. 4 Edw. III.)\r\n\r\n  “44 Edw. III.—The butchers of London are forbidden to slaughter cattle\r\n  within that city, or throw entrails into the river Thames, on\r\n  forfeiture of the carcase and imprisonment. (Rot. claus. 44 Edw. III.)\r\n\r\n  “A.D. 1370, 3 Rich. II.—The inhabitants of Smithfield and Holborn\r\n  complain of the infection of the air from butchers slaughtering\r\n  cattle, &c., and casting entrails into the ditches. (Petit, in Parl. 3\r\n  Rich. II.)\r\n\r\n  “By stat. 12th Rich. II. c. 13.—None shall cast any garbage or dung or\r\n  filth into ditches, waters, or other places within or near any city or\r\n  town, on pain of punishment by the Lord Chancellor at his discretion.\r\n\r\n  “Butchers of London shall erect a slaughter-house on the banks of the\r\n  Thames, and thither carry off their offals, which, when cut into\r\n  pieces, shall be carried in boats, and at the commencement of the ebb\r\n  cast into the river. (Rot. Parl. 16 Rich. II.)\r\n\r\n  “A.D. 1392, 16 Rich. II.—It is enacted that the butchers of London\r\n  shall not slaughter therein any swine or other beasts for sale. (Rot.\r\n  Parl. 16 Rich. II.)\r\n\r\n  “Same date.—All filth, &c. ordered by Parliament to be removed from\r\n  both banks of the Thames between the palace of Westminster and the\r\n  power of London; and butchers or others are prohibited from casting\r\n  entrails, &c. into the river on penalty of 40_l._ (Ibid.)\r\n\r\n  “Parliament forbids all persons from throwing dung, garbage, or\r\n  entrails of slaughtered beasts into rivers or waters near cities or\r\n  towns to corrupt the air and cause infection. (Rot. claus. 4 Hen. IV.)\r\n\r\n  “The Chancellor is authorized to treat touching the non-rebuilding of\r\n  two forges in Fleet-street, London, demolished in a riot, as\r\n  straitening the said street.” (Rot. Parl. 18 Hen. VI.)\r\n\r\nWe find the authority of Parliament exercised in the reign of Henry VII.\r\nto restrain a nuisance. In the 4th of his reign, c. 3.\r\n\r\n  “Item, it was shewed by a petition put to the king, our said sovereign\r\n  lord, in the said Parliament, by his subjects and parishioners of the\r\n  parish of St. Faith’s and St. Gregory’s in London, near adjoining unto\r\n  the cathedral church of St. Paul’s, that whereas great concourse of\r\n  people as well of his royal person as of other great lords and states\r\n  with other his true subjects, oftentimes was had unto the said\r\n  cathedral church, and that for the most part throughout the parishes\r\n  aforesaid the which oftentimes been greatly annoyed and distempered by\r\n  corrupt airs engendered in the said parishes, by occasion of blood and\r\n  other foulis things by reason of the slaughter of beasts and scalding\r\n  of swine, had and done in the butchery of St. Nicholas’s flesh\r\n  shambles, whose corruption and foul ordure by violence of unclean,\r\n  corrupt, and putrefied waters is borne down through the said parishes,\r\n  &c., complaint whereof at many and divers seasons also by the space of\r\n  sixteen years continually, as well by canons and petty canons of the\r\n  said cathedral church, landlords there, as also by many other of the\r\n  king’s subjects, of right honest behaviour, hath been made unto divers\r\n  mayors and aldermen of the City of London and no remedy had ne found;\r\n  that it may please our said sovereign lord of his abundant grace, to\r\n  provide for the conservation as well of his most royal person, as to\r\n  succour his poor subjects and suppliants in this behalf, considering\r\n  that in few noble cities and towns, or none within Christendon,\r\n  whereat travelling men have laboured, the common slaughter-house of\r\n  beasts should be kept in any special part within the walls of the\r\n  same, lest it might engender sickness unto the destruction of the\r\n  people.”\r\n\r\nTherefore it is enacted that butchers shall not slay beasts within the\r\nwalls of London; and that this law be observed in every walled town\r\n“except Berwick and Carlisle.”\r\n\r\nThe courts, however, have always had regard to the convenience of trade:\r\nthus it was held,—\r\n\r\n  “Si homme fait candells deins un vill, per qui il cause un noysom sent\r\n  al inhabitants, uncore ceo nest ascun nusans car le _needfulness_ de\r\n  eux dispensera ove le noisomness del _smell_.” (2 Roll’s Abr. 139.)\r\n\r\nBut this decision has been doubted, “Because,” says Serjeant Hawkins,\r\nPl. Cor. 190, c. 75, “whatever necessity there may be that candles be\r\nmade, it cannot be pretended to be necessary to make them in a town, and\r\nthat the trade of a brewer is as necessary as that of a chandler; and\r\nyet it seems to be agreed that a brewhouse erected in such an\r\ninconvenient place where the business cannot be carried on without\r\nincommoding greatly the neighbourhood may be indicted as a common\r\nnuisance. A presentment was made to a Leet for erecting a glass-house;\r\nand Twisden, J., said he had known an information adjudged against one\r\nfor erecting a brewhouse near Serjeants’ Inn; but it was insisted that a\r\nman ought not to be punished for erecting anything necessary for the\r\nexercise of his lawful trade; and it being answered that it ought to be\r\nin convenient places where it may not be a nuisance, the other justices\r\ndoubted, and agreed that it was unlawful only to erect such things near\r\nthe King’s palace.” Vent. 26, Pasch. 21, Car. 2. Recently, however, when\r\nsome architects and medical gentlemen went to the top of Buckingham\r\nPalace to examine it preparatory to its occupation by Her Majesty, they\r\nwere assailed by a cloud of smoke from the chimney of the furnace of a\r\nneighbouring brewery; and the nuisance remains to the present time in\r\nfull force, notwithstanding the statutory provisions against it.\r\n\r\nWhere the defendant in his business as a printer employed a\r\nsteam-engine, which produced a continued noise and vibration in the\r\nplaintiff’s apartment which adjoined the premises of the defendant, this\r\nwas held to be a nuisance. The Duke of Northumberland _v._ Clowes, C.\r\nP., at Westminster, A.D., 1824.\r\n\r\nThe earlier sanitary regulations were frequently set forth in the\r\nprovisions of the local Acts for the regulation of the streets. From the\r\nearly street regulations of the city of London, we find that the purity\r\nof the river and of the contributary streams was zealously regarded; the\r\nward inquests were specially charged to inquire:—\r\n\r\n  “If any manner of person cast or lay dung, ordure, rubbish, sea-coal\r\n  dust, rushes, or any other noiant, in the river of Thames, Walbrook,\r\n  Fleet, or other ditches of this city, or in the open streets, ways, or\r\n  lanes within this city.\r\n\r\n  “Also, if any person in or after a great rain falleth, or at any other\r\n  time, sweep any dung, ordure, rubbish, rushes, sea-coal dust, or any\r\n  other thing noiant down into the channel of any street or lane,\r\n  whereby the common course there is let, and the same things noiant\r\n  driven down into the said water of Thames.”\r\n\r\nBut when it is considered how few of the streets were paved, or sewered,\r\nor drained, the following regulation indicates what must have been their\r\ncondition and the habits of the inhabitants:—\r\n\r\n  “No man shall cast any urine-boles or ordure-boles into the street by\r\n  day or night, afore the hour of nine in the night: and also he shall\r\n  not cast it out, but bring it down, and lay it in the channel, under\r\n  the pain of three shillings and four-pence; and if he do cast it upon\r\n  any person’s head, the party to have a lawful recompense, if he have\r\n  hurt thereby.”\r\n\r\nThe state in which the streets were under such regulations is indicated\r\nin the proclamations issued at the time of the Plague, 1569, to “warne\r\nall inhabitants against their houses to keep channels clear from filth,\r\n(by onlie turning yt) aside, that the water may have passage.”\r\n\r\nThe prominent provisions of the modern Sewers’ and Street Acts are those\r\nwhich contain penalties against the most effectual means of\r\nstreet-cleansing,—that by discharging the street refuse through the\r\nsewers; but whilst the local legislation was deficient in principle in\r\nthe main provisions, it is distinguished by a multitude of particular\r\nprovisions against nuisances and obstructions, which would argue the\r\nmost extensive foresight. The nature of the provisions habitually\r\nresorted to are illustrated in the statute of 4th Geo. IV. c. 50, s. l,\r\nfor building the new London Bridge.[42]\r\n\r\n“Every man may abate a common nuisance.” Br. Nuisance. “The nuisance may\r\nbe abated, that is, taken away or removed by the aggrieved thereby, so\r\nas he commits no riot in doing of it.” “And the reason,” says\r\nBlackstone, “why the law allows this private and summary method of doing\r\none’s-self justice, is because injuries of this kind which obstruct or\r\nannoy such things as are of daily convenience and use require an\r\nimmediate remedy, and cannot wait for the slow progress of the ordinary\r\nforms of justice.” Com. B. iii. 6. And the annotator adds, “The security\r\nof the lives and property may sometimes require so speedy a remedy as\r\nnot to allow time to call on the person on whose property the mischief\r\nhas arisen to remedy it. Pardon for a nuisance is void as for the\r\ncontinuance thereof.” 3 Cro. Jac. 492, Dewell _v._ Saunders.\r\n\r\n\r\n _State of the Special Authorities for reclaiming the Execution of the\r\n             Laws for the Protection of the Public Health._\r\n\r\nThe most important, perhaps, because the most cheap and accessible\r\nauthority for reclaiming the execution of the law for the protection of\r\nthe subject against nuisances, for punishing particular violations of\r\nit, was vested in the Courts Leet. The statute of the view of\r\nFrankpledge, 13 Edw. II., directs inquiry to be made of waters turned,\r\nor stopped, or brought from their right course, and obstructions in\r\nditches were presentable at the Leet; but the stopping up a\r\nwatering-place for cattle was held not to be presentible as a common\r\nnuisance. (40 Lit. 56 _a._) The juries, commonly called “annoyance\r\njuries,” impanelled to serve on Courts Leet in towns, are accustomed to\r\nperambulate their districts to judge of nuisances upon the view. But the\r\nstate of this machinery will be seen in the state of the evils which\r\ncome within its jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nWith all this legal strength, however, there is scarcely one town in\r\nEngland which we have found in a low sanitary condition, nor scarcely\r\none village marked as the abode of fever, that does not present an\r\nexample of standing violations of the law, and of the infliction of\r\npublic and common as well as of private injuries, the tenements\r\novercrowded, streets replete with injurious nuisances, the streams of\r\npure water polluted, and the air rendered noisome.\r\n\r\nThe chimneys of the furnaces which darken the atmospheres, and pour out\r\nvolumes of smoke and soot upon the inhabitants of populous towns, afford\r\nmost frequent examples of the inefficiency of the local administration,\r\nand the contempt of the law for the protection of the public against\r\nnuisances which are specially provided for.\r\n\r\nMost modern private Acts contain penalties on gas-companies permitting\r\ntheir washings to contaminate streams, or using for steam-engines\r\nfurnaces which do not consume their own smoke. The general statute, 1\r\nand 2 Geo. IV. c. 41, empowers the court to award costs to the\r\nprosecutor of those who use such furnaces. Where the grievance may be\r\nremedied by altering the construction of the furnace employed in the\r\nworking of engines by steam, the court may make an order for preventing\r\nthe nuisance in future.\r\n\r\nThe specific effects of an excess of smoke on the general health of a\r\ntown population has not been distinguished, but from the comparatively\r\nhigh average of mortality amongst the middle classes in situations\r\nundistinguished by confined residences, or defective drainage, or\r\nanything but an excessively smoky atmosphere; from the comparatively\r\nrapid improvement of convalescents on removal to purer atmospheres,\r\nthere is strong reason to believe that the prejudicial effect is much\r\nmore considerable than is commonly apprehended even by medical\r\npractitioners. As the smoke in Manchester and other towns becomes more\r\ndense, the vegetation declines; and even in the suburbs the more\r\ndelicate species die. _Dr. Baker_, in his report on the sanitary\r\ncondition of the town of Derby, after adverting to the state of the\r\nplaces of work as affecting the health of the operations, proceeds to\r\nnotice the effects of the smoke:—\r\n\r\n  “The next general cause of injury to public health, and connected with\r\n  the foregoing, is the corruption of the air caused by the torrents of\r\n  black smoke that issue from the manufactory chimneys, the nuisance\r\n  from which is much augmented in heavy and moist states of the\r\n  atmosphere. There is a law by which those who most offend, as regards\r\n  their chimneys, can be punished; but of course the magistrates are not\r\n  also prosecutors, whilst, private individuals, being unwilling to\r\n  become informers, little is done to check this nuisance; and such is\r\n  the state of the air, that in gardens in the town none but deciduous\r\n  shrubs can be kept alive.”\r\n\r\nBesides the prejudicial effects on the health of the population by the\r\ndeterioration of the quality of the air that is breathed, a serious\r\neffect is created by its operation as an impediment to the formation and\r\nmaintenance of habits of personal and household cleanliness amongst the\r\nworking classes. Even upon the middle and higher classes the nuisance of\r\nan excess of smoke, occasioned by ignorance and culpable carelessness,\r\noperates as a tax increasing the wear and tear of linen and the expense\r\nof washing, to all who live within the range of the mismanaged chimneys.\r\nIn the suburbs of Manchester, for example, linen will be as dirty in two\r\nor three days as it would be even in the suburbs of London in a week.\r\nOne person stated that, on the Isle of Arran, a shirt was cleaner at the\r\nend of a week’s wear than at Manchester at the end of a day’s.\r\n\r\nNor is this the only oppressive tax occasioned by the carelessness; _Mr.\r\nThomas Cubitt_, the eminent builder, when examined before the Committee\r\nof the House of Commons, was asked,—\r\n\r\n  “Suppose it were intended to build a row of houses, would you not\r\n  suffer them to be built unless there was a sewer provided?—I would not\r\n  allow a house to be built anywhere unless it could be shown that there\r\n  was a good drainage, and a good way to get rid of water. I think that\r\n  there should be some public officer responsible for that; that there\r\n  should be surveys of every district, so that the officer should be\r\n  aware whether the sewers were provided or not. I think there should be\r\n  an officer paid at the public expense, who should be responsible for\r\n  that. I think they should not be appointed by the district; there\r\n  should be no favouritism of that kind; but public officers, changed\r\n  from point to point, to take care of all public nuisances. With\r\n  respect to manufactories, here are a great number driven by\r\n  competition to work in the cheapest way they can. A man puts up a\r\n  steam-engine, and sends out an immense quantity of smoke; perhaps he\r\n  creates a great deal of foul and bad gas; that is all let loose. Where\r\n  his returns are 1000_l._ a-month, if he would spend 5_l._ a-month more\r\n  he would make that completely harmless; but he says, ‘I am not bound\r\n  to do that,’ and therefore he works as cheaply as he can, and the\r\n  public suffer to an extent beyond all calculation. I look upon it it\r\n  has this effect: a gentleman comes to London, and lives in London; I\r\n  will suppose he fits up his house in the best style he can; he has a\r\n  taste for good pictures and upholstery, and so on. After a time the\r\n  smoke has destroyed them, and he is disappointed and annoyed, and the\r\n  effect is he is brought down in his feelings in a degree from the\r\n  state in which he was accustomed to have things.”\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the towns on the Sunday, when nearly all the furnaces\r\nare stopped, when there is little more than the smoke from the\r\ndwelling-houses, when everything is comparatively bright, and the\r\ndistant hills and surrounding country that are never visible though the\r\natmosphere of the town in the week-days may be seen across it, presents\r\nnearly the appearance which such towns would assume on the working days,\r\nif the laws were duly executed, and the excessive smoke of the furnaces\r\nprevented. On inquiry of a peace-officer acting where redress is\r\nprovided for under a local Act, how it was that the dereliction of duty\r\noccurred that was visible in the dense black clouds that darkened the\r\ntown, he replied that the chief members of the Board were the persons\r\nwhose furnace-chimneys were most in fault, and he appealed whether a man\r\nin his condition was to be expected to prosecute his patrons?\r\n\r\nThe greater part, if not the whole, of the excess of smoke and of\r\nunconsumed gas by which the metropolis and the neighbourhoods of\r\nmanufactories are oppressed, is preventible by the exercise of care in\r\nthe management of the fires of the furnaces. And here also the measures\r\nfor the prevention of the nuisance are measures of economy.\r\n\r\nMany witnesses whose opinions are enforced by practical examples, state\r\nconfidently that such nuisances are generally the result of ignorance or\r\ncarelessness. Amongst others we may cite the authority of Mr. Ewart, the\r\ninspector of machinery to the Admiralty, residing at Her Majesty’s\r\nDock-yard at Woolwich, where the chimney of the manufactory under his\r\nimmediate superintendence, regulated according to his directions, offers\r\nan example of the little smoke that need be occasioned from steam-engine\r\nfurnaces if care be exercised. He states that no peculiar machinery is\r\nused; the stoker or fire-keeper is only required to exercise care in not\r\nthrowing on too much coal at once, and to open the furnace door in such\r\nslight degree as to admit occasionally the small proportion of\r\natmospheric air requisite to effect complete combustion. Mr. Ewart also\r\nstates that if the fire be properly managed, there will be a saving of\r\nfuel. The extent of smoke denotes the extent to which the combustion is\r\nincomplete. The chimney belonging to the manufactory of Mr. Peter\r\nFairbairn, engineer at Leeds, also presents an example and a contrast to\r\nthe chimneys of nearly all the other manufactories which overcast that\r\ntown. On each side of it is a chimney belonging to another manufactory,\r\npouring out dense clouds of smoke; whilst the chimney at Mr. Fairbairn’s\r\nmanufactory presents the appearance of no greater quantity of smoke than\r\nof some private houses. Mr. Fairbairn stated, in answer to inquiries\r\nupon this subject, that he uses what is called Stanley’s feeding\r\nmachinery, which graduates the supply of coal so as to produce nearly\r\ncomplete combustion. After the fire is once lighted, little remains to\r\nthe ignorance or the carelessness of the stoker. Mr. Fairbairn also\r\nstates that his consumption of fuel in his steam-engine furnaces, in\r\ncomparison with that of his immediate neighbours, is proportionately\r\nless. The engine belonging to the cotton-mills of Mr. Thomas Ashton, of\r\nHyde, near Stockport, affords to the people of that town an example of\r\nthe extent to which, by a little care, they might be relieved of the\r\nthick cloud of smoke by which the district is oppressed.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of manufacturers and others, held at Leeds, for the\r\nsuppression of the nuisance of the smoke of furnaces, and to discuss the\r\nvarious plans for abating it, the resolution was unanimously adopted,\r\n“that in the opinion of this meeting the smoke arising from steam-engine\r\nfires and furnaces can be consumed, and that, too, without injury to the\r\nboilers, and with a saving of fuel.” Notice of legal proceedings being\r\ngiven against Messrs. Meux, the brewers in London, for a nuisance\r\narising from the chimneys of two furnaces, they found that by using\r\nanthracite coal they abated the nuisance to the neighbourhood, and saved\r\n200_l._ per annum. The West Middlesex Water Company, by diminishing the\r\nsmoke of their furnaces saved 1000_l._ per annum.\r\n\r\nThe gas-companies in the city of London were indicted for throwing their\r\nrefuse into the Thames, and compelled to dispose of it otherwise; and\r\nthey found out that they had been guilty of waste as well as of\r\nnuisance; and it is stated that the whole of what was formerly cast away\r\nhas now become an important article of commerce.\r\n\r\nIn the rural districts the Courts Leet have generally fallen into\r\ndesuetude. In illustration of the feeble tenure on which they were held,\r\nI may mention that in some instances, where it has been necessary to\r\ndisallow payments of fees paid to the officers of those courts from the\r\npoor’s rates, the stewards have stated that they should hereafter\r\ndiscontinue the courts; and it is probable that they did so. In the\r\ntowns, Courts Leet are sometimes held, and inquest juries appointed; but\r\nit is objected to these bodies, and frequently to the bodies constituted\r\nunder local acts, that they are usually composed of tradesmen who attend\r\nunwillingly and at an inconvenient sacrifice of time; who can have\r\nlittle or no information in respect to the evils in question; who have\r\nno arrangements to bring the evils in question before them; no time to\r\nmaster such information as may be brought before them casually; little\r\ninterest and scarcely any real responsibility imposed for ensuring any\r\nmastery of it; and neither time nor adequate means at their disposal for\r\nthe removal of such evils as those in question when they are presented\r\nto them, and proved to exist. Thus: two persons of respectability who\r\nwere unexpectedly called upon to serve on a jury of this description in\r\nthe metropolis, state that, as they had no properly qualified officer to\r\ninstruct them, they were only directed to the performance of their\r\nduties by the accidental presence of a builder.\r\n\r\n  “When we were sworn in, we went over the district: we went through\r\n  many places which were disgustingly filthy, that I have since learned\r\n  were places where there is always fever, but we were not told about\r\n  it; the afflicted knew nothing of our coming, and we had no medical\r\n  officer, or means to enable us to detect the presence of any nuisances\r\n  which would endanger the public health.\r\n\r\n  “The number of persons sworn in was twenty-four, of whom I can\r\n  remember six were publicans (at one or other of whose houses we dined\r\n  on the days of meeting), one or two cheesemongers, three or four\r\n  tailors or drapers, one builder, and one bricklayer; the trades or\r\n  occupations of the remainder I cannot remember. Of the twenty-four\r\n  sworn in, twelve only served, and the duties were performed in\r\n  rotation. An allowance of 2_s._ 6_d._ was given to each juryman for\r\n  his expenses on the days of acting, with the exception of the foreman\r\n  and the secretary, who had been unfortunate enough, or who, for some\r\n  purpose of their own, managed to be sworn in on three or four previous\r\n  occasions. None of the jury knew the nature of the duties further than\r\n  that they were to examine weights and measures; that part of their\r\n  duty respecting the removal of nuisances, or of things affecting the\r\n  health or the lives of the inhabitants of the district which we\r\n  perambulated, was entirely neglected or lost sight of; the only\r\n  instance that I remember of any attention being paid to the subject,\r\n  was that of the condemnation of an old house in a disgusting\r\n  neighbourhood of houses; and in this case, although the house\r\n  certainly looked in a bad condition, the jury were quite unable to\r\n  come to a decision until the bricklayer and builder pronounced its\r\n  condemnation, when the jury at once became unanimous, and condemned\r\n  the house forthwith. My own impression was, that the house was not in\r\n  a safe condition, but I felt, in common with others, (the tailors,\r\n  drapers, and cheesemongers,) that however anxious we might be to\r\n  discharge our duties faithfully, that the nature of our occupations\r\n  did not at all qualify us to express an opinion upon the subject, and\r\n  hence we were all guided and determined by the opinion of the\r\n  bricklayer and builder who happened to be present. Had they not been\r\n  present, we should probably have done nothing. It is only necessary\r\n  for any sensible person to serve on such a body in a town to be\r\n  convinced of its entire inefficiency.”\r\n\r\nThe district over which this jury perambulated was one in which\r\ncontagious disease often prevails in its worst forms; and it is quite\r\nclear that, without appropriate arrangements, such a body would continue\r\nto walk over the ground, equally unconscious of the evil and impotent to\r\neffect its removal.\r\n\r\nA civil engineer and surveyor of very high acquirements in the\r\nmetropolis thus describes the qualification of persons serving on these\r\ninquests:—\r\n\r\n  “I speak from experience, having personally attended one of these\r\n  inquests, with a view to give them the benefit of my practical\r\n  knowledge; I did not find one of them amongst the twelve competent to\r\n  perform usefully to the parish or the public the duties imposed upon\r\n  them. I have known repeated instances in these united parishes, where\r\n  ruinous houses have been permitted to remain for years without\r\n  receiving any attention from the authorities, to the great danger of\r\n  the occupiers and also to the public. I would instance two houses that\r\n  to my certain knowledge have for ten or a dozen years inclined over in\r\n  the street from the pavement upwards of eighteen inches, without being\r\n  noticed by an Inquest Jury. My attention was lately directed\r\n  professionally by the owner of the houses in question to their state\r\n  and condition; upon a careful examination I found them so dangerous\r\n  that I immediately gave directions to have them shored up, and\r\n  recommended the tenant to vacate them in the meanwhile: to my great\r\n  surprise, at the expiration of three or four days after the houses had\r\n  been properly secured, the freeholders were served with a notice from\r\n  the Inquest Jury to do what had already been done, viz., secure the\r\n  houses from danger.”\r\n\r\nA gentleman who has acted as one of the Commissioners under the Act for\r\nBolton, thus describes the operation of its provisions:—\r\n\r\n  “We have an Act in Little Bolton with extensive powers for the\r\n  preservation of the public health.\r\n\r\n  “I was appointed in 1837 one of the Trustees or Commissioners under\r\n  this Act; they are elected by the ratepayers, and one-third go out\r\n  annually; party political feeling has created a strife as to whether\r\n  Whigs or Tories shall expend the public funds (the same is the case in\r\n  Manchester), and hence a strife as to the economy of management. The\r\n  streets are badly lighted, and sometimes not at all, to save the\r\n  expense of gas. A surveyor is appointed in Little Bolton, whose duties\r\n  are to see after the lighting, paving, cleansing, sewering,\r\n  fire-engines, and firemen, the prevention of nuisances, encroachments,\r\n  &c., &c.; to hiring and paying all the workmen, and buying the\r\n  materials for repairing the roads and streets over a district\r\n  containing about 15,000 inhabitants, for all of which service he\r\n  receives 80_l._ a-year.\r\n\r\n  “With such talent as 80_l._ a-year will command, and such duties to\r\n  perform, it may readily be supposed that sewerages and nuisances are\r\n  liable to be overlooked.\r\n\r\n  “I once called the surveyor before a Board of about twenty Trustees,\r\n  to draw attention to a pool of stagnant water lying in front of or\r\n  betwixt two rows of cottages about 60 feet apart from each other, and\r\n  about 150 feet long, covering nearly the whole of this vacant space of\r\n  around from one to two feet deep; dead dogs, kittens, and other\r\n  impurities in the height of summer were floating in it, yet I was\r\n  unable to obtain an order for the surveyor to expend a few pounds in\r\n  draining it off, or to compel the owner to do it, although situate in\r\n  the centre of a very populous district; and it continued in the same\r\n  state till built over by cottages the following year.”\r\n\r\nThe nuisances which favoured the introduction and spread of the cholera\r\nwere for the most part evils within the cognizance of the Leets, and\r\ncould not have existed had their powers been properly exercised, yet so\r\ncomplete was the desuetude of the machinery of these Courts that it\r\nappeared nowhere to be thought of as applicable, and the new and special\r\nmachinery of the Boards of Health were created for the purpose of\r\nmeeting the pestilence. There are no funds provided by which the common\r\nremedy by indictment could now be prosecuted: and since the most\r\noffensive and injurious nuisances are those supported by large capital,\r\nredress for the private injury is practically available only to persons\r\nwho can afford to risk large sums in litigation. In one instance in\r\nScotland, where the stream which supplied a village was discoloured and\r\nrendered disagreeable to the taste by some dye-works, a gentleman who\r\ntook up the defence of the villagers, who were mostly his tenants,\r\nstated to me that the litigation incurred by an obstinate defence\r\ninvolved an expenditure of no less a sum than 4,000_l._, the whole of\r\nwhich he did not recover, and that from his own experience he was\r\nclearly of opinion no one who had not most inflexible determination, as\r\nwell as ample means, would be warranted in entering upon such a contest.\r\nPowerful influence was used to induce him to stay the suit, and he was\r\nby persons of his own class regarded as the persecutor of the author of\r\nthe nuisance.\r\n\r\nThe complication of various nuisances in some of the larger\r\nmanufacturing districts has frequently become so great as to put them\r\nbeyond any existing legal remedy, whether private or public, by placing\r\nout of the apparent possibility of distinct technical proof any injury\r\nor particular effect arising from any one. An instance of this is stated\r\nby Messrs. Paris and Fonblanque, where two indictments were preferred;\r\nthe one preferred against the proprietor of a Prussian-blue manufactory;\r\nthe other against a black-ash manufacturer; both of these works were\r\nsituated in Seward-street, Goswell-street, London. The counsel for the\r\ndefendant, in his cross-examination of the witnesses for the prosecution\r\nof the Prussian-blue maker, drew from them an account of the noisome\r\nvapours of the black-ash manufactury; while in the latter trial the same\r\nbarrister made the witnesses declare the extreme stench of the\r\nPrussian-blue manufactory; so that in both cases the defendants obtained\r\na verdict, because in neither case could the witnesses for the Crown\r\nunequivocally prove from which of the manufactories the nuisance\r\ncomplained of arose.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _State of the Local Executive Authorities for the Erection and\r\n Maintenance of Drains and other Works for the Protection of the Public\r\n                                Health._\r\n\r\nHaving shown the state of the existing local authority for reclaiming\r\nthe execution of the law, for _causing_ that to be done “which the\r\ncommon good requires,” and those things not to be done which tend “to\r\nthe annoyance of all the king’s subjects,” I proceed to describe the\r\ngeneral state of the executive authority, charged with the _doing_ of so\r\nmuch of these things as is comprehended in town and road drainage; the\r\nsewerage for house and street drainage, and the provisions for the\r\nsurface cleansing of streets.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the areas to be drained determines arbitrarily the extent\r\nof the operations of drainage, whether public or private, which shall\r\ncombine efficiency and economy. If these areas are occupied by different\r\nparties, they cannot be cleared separately at an expense proportioned to\r\nthe extent cleared. In general they are only to be won by agreement\r\namongst the parties holding the property, to place the operations under\r\nthe guidance of science; these labours will then be rewarded by\r\nproduction, whilst disease and pestilence, as well as sterility, are the\r\neffects of the ignorance and selfish rapacity which impede such union\r\nfor the common advantage. The early history of the attempts of the\r\nseparate owners of portions of the tract of country included in the\r\nBedford Level to drain their property separately, is a history of\r\nexpensive failures, of attempts to get rid of the surplus water only by\r\nflooding the lands of neighbours, and scenes of wretched animosities.\r\nThese continued until the whole tract was put under one strong authority\r\nand scientific guidance, when productiveness and health arose as\r\ndescribed in the account of the sanitary condition of the Isle of Ely.\r\nHad the natural district formed by the geological basin of that level\r\nbeen subdivided for drainage operations into districts co-extensive with\r\ndistricts for municipal, ecclesiastical, or parochial and civil\r\nadministrative purposes; or had it been divided into districts according\r\nto property or occupation; had the commissions charged with the drainage\r\nof these subdivisions acted independently by ill-paid and ill-qualified\r\nofficers, without any competent control, instead of acting on one\r\ncomprehensive plan in subordination to an engineer of science adequate\r\nto its design and execution, vast sums of money might have been spent,\r\nand the land would still have remained a pestilential marsh occupied by\r\na miserable population.\r\n\r\nThe amount of surface-water on those lands made the expediency of\r\nenlarged operations obvious, and their necessity pressing. Besides the\r\ntowns and tracts of country oppressed with surface-water, as described\r\nin such evidence as that cited from the sanitary reports from populous\r\ndistricts, the extent of country which is unhealthy as well as\r\ncomparatively unproductive, from the want of systematic under-drainage,\r\nappears to be extensive and immense beyond any conception that could be\r\nformed _à priori_, from the more conspicuous instances of enterprize,\r\nintelligence, and science manifest amongst the population. What the\r\ntract of country belonging to the Bedford Level, so subdivided and\r\ninefficiently and expensively managed once was, large urban and rural\r\ndistricts are now found to be in degree. The circumstances which govern\r\nwhat is called the private drainage will illustrate the nature of the\r\nadministrative obstacles to efficient public drainage, and it is\r\nnecessary to consider them in connexion, for they are inseparably\r\nconnected by nature.\r\n\r\nAlthough the larger share of the land-drainage redounds to the pecuniary\r\nprofit of private individuals, yet it is proved so far to affect, the\r\npublic health beneficially, and contribute to the productive employment\r\nof the labouring classes, and to other general public advantages, that\r\nsuch works fairly come within the description of _publicum in privato_,\r\nand as such entitled to collective and legislative care. Drainage\r\nappears to be the primary, and in many cases the principal, operation\r\nfor the efficient construction and economical maintenance of roads. But\r\nan efficient system of sewerage, and general town and road-drainage, has\r\nan additional value as removing serious impediments to the general land\r\ndrainage. The following portion of the evidence of _Mr. Roe_ affords an\r\nexemplification of the extent to which the private land-drainage is\r\ncommonly affected by such operations:\r\n\r\n  “Have you found the sewerage produce any effect in the drainage of the\r\n  surrounding land?—Yes, we have found it lower the water in the wells,\r\n  often at great distances. For instance, in forming a sewer in the\r\n  City-road, we found that it lowered by four feet a well nearly a\r\n  quarter of a mile distance. The only remedy we could advise to the\r\n  parties was to lower the well: they did so. We afterwards had occasion\r\n  to lower the same sewer three feet, when the well was lowered again in\r\n  proportion; so that the construction of the sewer, in this instance,\r\n  drained an area of 40 or 50 acres on that side, and perhaps further.\r\n  The water is sometimes in such quantities, and so strong in the\r\n  land-springs, as to require openings to be left in the side of the\r\n  sewer for its passages.”\r\n\r\nThe first obstacles to the general land-drainage have already been\r\nadverted to in the small occupancies. To these must be added the want of\r\ncapital. The legislature has recently given to the owners of life\r\nestates the power of charging the inheritance with the contributions to\r\nthe cost of permanent improvements by drainage. This power does not meet\r\nthe case of the smaller holdings; and drainage operations to be\r\neffectual must, in general, be on a scale too large to be within the\r\nhabits of thought or action of small owners or occupiers, of varying\r\ninterests, and wanting confidence in each other to combine, make, or\r\nmanage immediate outlays for such purposes. But above all these is to be\r\nadded the circumstance of the power which the possession of a small part\r\nof a district gives to one individual, to thwart those operations of the\r\nmajority which are for the common advantage, and consequently the\r\ntemptation which the possession of such power gives and almost ensures,\r\nof its use to exact unjust and exorbitant conditions. When expressing to\r\na gentleman who has actively promoted improvements in agricultural\r\nproduction in Scotland, my surprise at the large extent of marshy\r\ndistrict allowed to continue in a state of comparative sterility,\r\nsources of rheumatism, and fevers and other diseases, he directed my\r\nattention to the following among other exemplifications:—\r\n\r\nAbout a mile and a half distant, from one of the towns in Scotland,\r\nthere is a moss about seven miles long, with a small stream running\r\nthrough it, with a fall of about 25 feet. At the outlet of this stream\r\nthere is an old corn-mill, which yields a rental of about 25_l._ per\r\nannum. By the water being dammed up to turn this mill, the whole run is\r\nimpeded; and the consequent sluggishness of the stream occasions it to\r\nbe choked up with weeds. Whenever a fall of rain takes place, the banks\r\nare overflowed, and not only is every improvement rendered\r\nimpracticable, but on several harvests as much as 500_l._ worth of hay\r\nhas been destroyed at a time when a heavy fall of rain has occurred and\r\noccasioned an overflow.\r\n\r\nIt so happens that the proprietor of the mill would himself clearly gain\r\nmore than the value of the mill from the drainage that would be effected\r\non his own lands by the removal of the dam. The other proprietors,\r\nhowever, offered to him for its removal the full rental that he now\r\nderives from the mill. The property is in the hands of a factor, who is\r\nignorant and obstinate, and the offer was refused. Now the land which\r\nwould be affected beneficially by the removal of the dam, is a tract of\r\nseven or eight miles long, with an average width of two miles and a\r\nhalf. The expense of an Act of Parliament, if it were resisted, as it\r\nmost probably would be, renders an appeal to the legislature valueless.\r\nThus one individual is enabled to exercise a despotic caprice against\r\nthe health and prosperity of the surrounding population, to inflict an\r\nextensive loss of labour and wages on the working man, the loss of\r\nproduce and profit to the occupiers, the loss of rent to the other\r\nowners, and at the same time to inflict on all who may live on the spot,\r\nor come within reach of the marsh, the ill health and hazards of disease\r\nfrom the miasma which it emits!\r\n\r\nThe like despotic powers are found in every district in the way of the\r\npublic health, as well as of the private advantage.\r\n\r\nThe passenger who enters Birmingham from the London railway may\r\nperceive, just before the terminus, a black sluggish stream, which is\r\nthe river Rea, made the receptacle of the sewers of the town. _Mr.\r\nHodgson_, and the committee of physicians of that town, state, in their\r\nsanitary report, that—\r\n\r\n  “The stream is sluggish, and the quantity of water which it supplies\r\n  is not sufficient to dilute and wash away the refuse which it receives\r\n  in passing through the town, and that in hot weather it is\r\n  consequently very offensive, and in some situations in these seasons\r\n  is covered with a thick scum of decomposing matters; and this filthy\r\n  condition of the river near the railway station is a subject of\r\n  constant and merited animadversions, and that it requires especial\r\n  attention lest it should become a source of disease,” &c.\r\n\r\nThe fatally dangerous sluggishness of this river is occasioned by the\r\ndiversion and abstraction of its water to turn a mill, “a fact which\r\nwill amply account for the deficiency and sluggishness of the current in\r\nthe very places where the contrary condition is the most wanted.”\r\n_Captain Vetch_, who has been engaged in engineering operations in that\r\npart of the country which have led him to observe the spot, states that—\r\n\r\n  “The remedy is as easy as the evil is great; all obstruction being\r\n  removed from the course of the brook, and the water restored to its\r\n  original bed, the object would be effected; as to the value of the\r\n  mill-power which would thus be subverted, it cannot be a matter of\r\n  much amount, in a place where coals and steam-engines are so cheap,\r\n  and where the constant and regular work of the mill must be an object\r\n  of some importance.”\r\n\r\nAfter describing the means of the removal, he states—\r\n\r\n  “In this manner, and by reserving the whole body of the water of the\r\n  Rea for cleansing its own bed, I have no doubt that this main sewer of\r\n  Birmingham would become as conspicuous for its wholesome and efficient\r\n  action as it now is for the contrary.”\r\n\r\nBirmingham presents an example such as indeed is common in most towns,\r\nof the stoppage of a main current of air by a private building carried\r\nacross one end of a main street. The effects likely to result from the\r\nobstruction to the invisible current are not dissimilar to those which\r\nresult from the obstruction to the stream of water, and the cost and\r\ndifficulty of relief from them are perhaps much greater. _Captain Vetch_\r\nrefers, as another example of the condition of many of the towns in\r\nrespect to these chief streams, as described in the sanitary reports, to\r\nthe case of Haddington.\r\n\r\n  “In the town of Haddington a mill-dam crosses the river Tyne in its\r\n  passage through the place, and into the mill-pool the main sewer is\r\n  discharged with a diminished and sluggish descent; and on occasion of\r\n  floods in the river, the water passes up the sewers and occasionally\r\n  lays the lowest part of the town under water. It would not be\r\n  difficult to direct the main sewer into the bed of the river below the\r\n  dam or weir, and by the additional declivity give some current to the\r\n  water of the sewer, which, from the pending up of the river at its\r\n  present outlet, has rendered it almost stagnant, so much so, that in\r\n  hot weather, and where it is not covered over, the exhalations are\r\n  very offensive; but was the sewer improved by the alteration\r\n  mentioned, still the pooling up of the river for the mill keeps the\r\n  lower part of the town damp, and even subjects it to partial\r\n  inundations.\r\n\r\n  “One of the medical officers reports, that when ‘fever has been at any\r\n  time prevalent in the town, it has been most so in a portion of it\r\n  called the Nungate, lying close by the river, when during the summer\r\n  and autumn it is occasionally almost stagnant, and where there is a\r\n  considerable decomposition of vegetable matter.’\r\n\r\n  “Another medical gentleman, speaking of the main sewer, says, ‘this\r\n  small burn is a receptacle of the privies and refuse of vegetable\r\n  matters from the houses near which it passes; and in those parts where\r\n  it is uncovered, it forms an excellent index of the weather; previous\r\n  to rain the smell is intolerable.’\r\n\r\n  “The same gentleman proposes, as a remedy, that another small burn\r\n  having a parallel course at a short distance, should be turned into\r\n  the sewer to aid the sewerage. From my knowledge of the locality, the\r\n  recommendation, I should say, is judicious; but in this manner, though\r\n  the supply of water would be increased, the declivity or rather want\r\n  of declivity of the sewer would remain the same, and could only be\r\n  improved by removing the mill-dam, or directing the sewer into the bed\r\n  of the river below it, as already mentioned. Unquestionably from the\r\n  penning up of the river, the lower part of the town is at present very\r\n  ill drained, and it is somewhat remarkable that it was the first site\r\n  in Scotland visited by the Asiatic cholera.\r\n\r\n  “In reference to the two cases cited, and to others of a similar\r\n  nature, it should be remarked, that the vicinities of the nuisances\r\n  are chiefly inhabited by the poorer classes, and who, from want of\r\n  influence in their own parts, are the more necessarily thrown under\r\n  the protection of state regulations.”\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that any improvements have been suggested to the\r\ninhabitants, or any question raised in respect to the compensation to\r\nthe owners of these obstructions. They are, however, enabled to refuse a\r\nliberal compensation for removing from their property, and discontinuing\r\nproceedings so injurious by the agency of invisible miasma, that if the\r\nmiseries were brought about by direct manual or visible operations, it\r\nwould be deemed the most horrible tyranny. In many, if not in most such\r\ncases, the use of the property, with such attendant consequences, would\r\nbe found to be in contravention of the existing public rights; but the\r\nexpense and delay and uncertainty of the legal procedure practically\r\nsustain such invasions on the surrounding property and on the public\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nThe powers of continuing such evils amidst large masses of the\r\npopulation, and against specific representations of the attendant evils,\r\nare terrible when the extent of those evils are examined. For example,\r\nit is stated in the records of the proceedings before adverted to, with\r\nwhich _Dr. Currie_, of Liverpool, was connected, that,—\r\n\r\n  “In the beginning of the year 1802, the corporation of Liverpool,\r\n  being about to apply to Parliament for powers to improve the streets\r\n  and the police of the town, requested the physicians of the infirmary\r\n  and dispensary to suggest to them ‘such alterations as might\r\n  contribute to the health and comfort of the inhabitants,’ in order\r\n  that, where necessary, they might include in the Bill about to be\r\n  brought into Parliament the powers requisite to carry such alterations\r\n  into effect. The physicians took this request into serious\r\n  consideration, and presented a report of considerable extent,\r\n  including a view of the causes of the uncommon sickliness of the two\r\n  preceding years, and of the measures requisite to prevent its\r\n  recurrence, and to remove the frequency of contagion in the\r\n  habitations of the poor. To lessen as much as possible the\r\n  contamination of the atmosphere, they recommended that lime should be\r\n  prevented from being burnt within a certain distance of inhabited\r\n  houses; that soaperies, tan-yards, and other offensive manufactories,\r\n  should in future be prevented from being established in the town; and\r\n  where now established, and authorized by usage, that they should,\r\n  whenever practicable, be purchased by the body corporate, and the\r\n  space they occupy be converted to other purposes. The same\r\n  recommendation they extended to slaughter-houses, and to all other\r\n  offensive trades or manufactories. They recommend, that in all cases\r\n  where fire-engines, or steam-engines, are necessarily employed in the\r\n  town or its vicinity, the burning of smoke should be enforced, as well\r\n  as in all other practicable cases where large volumes of smoke are\r\n  emitted.\r\n\r\n  “They pointed out the necessity of enforcing cleanliness in the\r\n  streets, to which end an improvement of the pavement was represented\r\n  to be essential; and they particularly advised a general review of the\r\n  common sewers, and an improvement of their structure, on the\r\n  principles of a report on this particular subject addressed by them to\r\n  the mayor and magistrates in 1788. They further advised that effectual\r\n  provision should be made for draining the grounds within the\r\n  liberties, and particularly to the north of the town. ‘Repeated\r\n  remonstrances (I quote the words of the report) have been made for the\r\n  last twenty years on the collections of standing water, including\r\n  filth of every kind, which are suffered to remain in the district\r\n  which extends along the termination of the streets from St.\r\n  Paul’s-square to Byrom-street, and to which the low fevers which, in\r\n  the autumnal months especially, infest these streets, are principally\r\n  to be imputed. These remonstrances have been passed over, on the\r\n  ground, as we are informed, that the proprietors of the lands will not\r\n  agree to the plan necessary for draining them.’”\r\n\r\nSome of the most important improvements that might be accomplished in\r\nthe poorer and most infected districts of the larger towns by pulling\r\ndown the present tenements and erecting tenements of a superior order,\r\nwould, there is little doubt, amply repay any large capitalist or single\r\nproprietor. In the course of our examination of the most wretched and\r\novercrowded wynds of Glasgow and Edinburgh, we were informed by persons\r\napparently of competent local information that, if they could be\r\npurchased at a fair price for the public to be pulled down, there would\r\nbe a gain in the prevention of the charges of sickness and crime arising\r\nfrom them; and that if they were simply rebuilt on a good plan, the\r\nnecessary outlay would be repaid by the improved rental from the\r\nsuperior order of tenements. Each flat or story, however, frequently\r\nbelonged to a different owner, and the property in which the most\r\nafflicted classes lived appeared to be extensively subdivided amongst\r\npersons of different interests, of different degrees of permanency, and\r\nwith no power of co-operation, and with little or no capital.\r\n\r\nNow the class of persons whose feelings, state of intelligence, and\r\nmodes of action are displayed in the evidence on the drainage redounding\r\nto private profit, are the class from amongst whom are necessarily taken\r\nthe members of the local boards, to whose uncontrolled direction and\r\nchoice of officer the structural works essential to the public health\r\nare confided.\r\n\r\nThe natural districts for public drainage are so capriciously subdivided\r\nand departed from, as frequently to render economical and efficient\r\ndrainage impracticable.\r\n\r\nThe municipal authorities who obtained powers for drainage, only thought\r\nof the surface drainage of their own jurisdictions. Some towns are at\r\nthe bottom of basins and others on elevations, and the operations for\r\neffectual drainage must often be commenced at a distance. It is stated\r\nby persons of competent skill in drainage, as an example, a town situate\r\non one side of a hill will be drained dry by tapping or opening a spring\r\non the other side. The manifest defect in the areas of operations for\r\ndrainage is noticed in the report of the Committee of the House of\r\nCommons, which in the year 1834 inquired into the administration of the\r\nsewers’ rate in the metropolis, where perhaps the most money has been\r\nexpended in imperfect sewerage and cleansing of any part of the kingdom.\r\nThey reported that a primary defect of their constitution—\r\n\r\n  “Is the want of system or combination between the different trusts\r\n  which have now, as before observed, each an independent action. The\r\n  inconveniences in this are palpable, for where the line of\r\n  communication with the Thames is not complete within each district,\r\n  the very improvements in the one trust may prove injurious to the\r\n  others. It appears by the evidence that a case of this kind occurred\r\n  not long ago in the city of Loudon, through which a part of the\r\n  Holborn and Finsbury sewerage is conducted to the river. The sewers of\r\n  the Holborn and Finsbury division having been greatly improved and\r\n  enlarged, the city sewers became inadequate to carry off their\r\n  contents, and a number of houses in the vicinity of the river were\r\n  inundated after each fall of rain, the contents of their own drains,\r\n  in addition to the waters from the high lands of the neighbouring\r\n  trust, being actually forced back into their houses from the volume of\r\n  water which occupied the main sewer. This has now been remedied at a\r\n  great expense to the city of London district, and by dint of much\r\n  labour and time; but if anything like combination had existed\r\n  previously, the improvements would have been carried on\r\n  simultaneously, and the inconvenience would never have occurred.”\r\n\r\nThe surveyor of the City sewers under the management of the corporation,\r\nspeaks in a tone of grievance and oppression, that the waters of the\r\ncounty would run into the municipal jurisdiction. Speaking of the\r\nformation of a particular sewer, he says,—\r\n\r\n  “The commissioners under the power of the Act of Parliament carried\r\n  the sewer, in the first instance, along their own pavement and for\r\n  their own drainage. It was thence continued up to Finsbury-place to\r\n  Bunhill-fields, then called Tyndal’s burial-ground, and is so\r\n  described in the Act; the county then communicated with it, and sent\r\n  their surplus water, or an immense run of it, into that sewer. The\r\n  city for its own drainage also built a sewer in Whitecross-street; the\r\n  county somehow or other got possession of that, and the water that\r\n  runs down Whitecross street is quite overpowering.”\r\n\r\nHe speaks of some other drains which were formed by the city, and the\r\neffects of the waters let in upon them from the county.\r\n\r\n  “The Commissioners find themselves very much annoyed by the quantity\r\n  of water poured in from the county, which water communicates with the\r\n  city in Bishopsgate-street, through Shoreditch. * * * The county then\r\n  made another sewer, which takes water from the Tower Hamlets, and is\r\n  continued up the Kingsland-road, so that a very large portion of that\r\n  water has been thrown into that sewer, and annoyed this Irongate sewer\r\n  (the only communication with the Thames) very sorely; and the\r\n  Commissioners had been put to an enormous expense in rebuilding it,\r\n  and that was increased by houses being built over it with very high\r\n  stacks of chimneys. In consequence of the immense flood of water that\r\n  pours down all those different sewers from the county, the inhabitants\r\n  of the city, in the neighbourhood of Moorfields especially, have been\r\n  most dreadfully annoyed, so much so that their cellars became useless.\r\n\r\n  “By the county, you mean the Holborn and Finsbury division?—Yes;\r\n  everything out of the boundary of the city. In order to meet the\r\n  difficulty for which there was no other cure, the commissioners have\r\n  built a sewer for the New London Bridge, which is ten feet by eight\r\n  feet at the mouth; they are continuing it up to the new street, eight\r\n  feet six inches by seven feet, and it is intended to take it up the\r\n  New Road to Moorfields, to continue the sewer along Princes-street and\r\n  up that new street; and I confidently expect I shall get from eight to\r\n  ten feet additional depth, and that then the whole of Moorfields will\r\n  be effectually relieved.\r\n\r\n  “The necessity for this new sewer of this large dimension, arises from\r\n  the large quantity of water which flows in upon you from the\r\n  county?—Certainly.\r\n\r\n  “You conceive yourself on the other side to derive some benefit from\r\n  these waters, because they cleanse and scour your sewers down?—Yes, as\r\n  far as the direct run goes they do, but beyond that they do an injury\r\n  that is incalculable; in this way the water runs right a-head, and an\r\n  immense quantity is brought in, it fills it, and the collateral sewers\r\n  cannot bear up against it, they are driven back and the sediment is\r\n  deposited, and when it falls that is left behind.”\r\n\r\nIt need scarcely be pointed out that this municipal division had, until\r\nthey chose to drain, operated as a barrier to all the water described,\r\nwhich was kept back to the injury of the county; to the injury indeed of\r\nthe health of those merchants and traders, clerks and men of business,\r\nthe population whose private residences are in the county, and beyond\r\ntheir residences to the injury of the city, in so far as their\r\nobstructions to drainage injured the pasturage and land cultivated for\r\nthe supply of the city.\r\n\r\nBut a considerable portion of the city was itself imperfectly drained.\r\nThe chairman was asked,—\r\n\r\n  “539. Do you conceive there is any large portion of the City left\r\n  without deriving direct advantage from the sewerage,—meaning, by\r\n  direct advantage, some underground communication with the sewers so as\r\n  to carry off the soil of the house?—There is a large part of the City\r\n  of London in that state.”\r\n\r\nIt was stated, as an example, that Cheapside had no sewer. This was\r\naccounted for from the circumstance, that the\r\n\r\n  “whole form of that part of the city is like a tortoise’s back.\r\n  Cheapside and Leadenhall-street are the back-bone; and that accounts\r\n  for Cheapside, being the highest ground, never having had occasion for\r\n  a sewer for the surface drainage; the water all flows northward and\r\n  southward, so that accounts for the apparent contradiction of\r\n  Cheapside, a main street, having no sewer in it.\r\n\r\n  “As far as _surface_ drainage is concerned?—Yes; the inhabitants of\r\n  Cheapside, generally speaking, have got cesspools: they perforated the\r\n  yellow clay or loam and got into the gravel, and whatever is thrown\r\n  into the cesspool mixes with the water and the earth: that is for the\r\n  benefit of the water-drinkers!”\r\n\r\nThirty old streets in Westminster had no sewers. Other considerable and\r\nancient streets were also without sewers, although the inhabitants\r\ncontributed to the rates.\r\n\r\nNor does there appear to be any conception as to the objects of the\r\nservice; and illegal fees, that must operate as exclusions to the poorer\r\ninhabitants from the advantages which it is most desirable to confer,\r\nwere allowed to be exacted by the officers. Thus the chairman of the\r\nCity Commission was asked,—\r\n\r\n  “574. Your clerks at the office take no fees?—I cannot say that they\r\n  take no fees; there is an ancient fee allowed, that any person who\r\n  communicates with the sewer shall pay a guinea; that is divided among\r\n  the clerks, the surveyor, and inspector, who see that the\r\n  communication is properly made: they pay a guinea for that purpose.\r\n\r\n  “575. Are your clerks paid by those fees?—No, by fixed salary; the\r\n  fees are very trifling, for till lately they did not amount to 100_l._\r\n  a-year.\r\n\r\n  “576. The aggregate of the fees?—Yes, nor to 50_l._ a-year: if a party\r\n  applies to communicate with a sewer, and the Commissioners have no\r\n  objection, they call upon him to pay the estimate of the surveyor, and\r\n  the charges are made at the contract price, and in addition to that\r\n  they pay one guinea as a fee.”\r\n\r\nIn another Commission the surveyor’s fee for the privilege is stated to\r\nbe one guinea.\r\n\r\nBefore the Committee _Mr. James Peake_, the surveyor of the\r\nCommissioners for the Tower Hamlets, states (Committee on Health of\r\nTowns), “that in making a communication to the common sewers, the\r\nparties who have to make the drain, besides doing it at their own\r\nexpense, have to pay 17_s._ 6_d._ for the first three feet of sewer. And\r\nthey,” the Commissioners of Sewers, “do that for this reason:—if they\r\nwere not to resort to that measure, the sewers would be destroyed.\r\n_Every one would make a hole in the sewer_,” _i. e._, every one would\r\n_use_ the sewer.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Samuel Byles_, another witness examined before the same Committee,\r\nwas asked—\r\n\r\n  “193. You state that a great deal of disease is generated by the want\r\n  of ventilation and sewerage; is there any power in the Sewer\r\n  Commissioners to oblige the parties inhabiting the district to\r\n  communicate with the sewer if they made one?—No; and there is\r\n  unfortunately a paradox; there is a penalty on any person\r\n  communicating from his house into the common sewer.\r\n\r\n  “194. If they are assessed to it that is not the case, is it?—Yes; it\r\n  appears to be a complete paradox; if privies are known to empty\r\n  themselves into the common sewer, the person is liable to a penalty.”\r\n\r\nNo arrangements are made to bring the effects of the absence of drainage\r\nto the knowledge of those bodies for their guidance in the performance\r\nof their duties, nor does it appear to enter into their conception that\r\nthe protection of the public health forms any part of the objects of\r\ntheir service. _Mr. James Peake_, the surveyor of the Commissioners of\r\nthe Tower Hamlets, was questioned on this point—\r\n\r\n  “2012. It is stated to the Committee, that ‘in a direct line from\r\n  Virginia-row to Shoreditch, a mile in extent, all the lanes, courts,\r\n  and alleys in the neighbourhood pour their contents into the centre of\r\n  the main street, where they stagnate and putrefy;’ is that the case?—I\r\n  perceive by an inspection of the plan that there is no sewer about\r\n  Virginia-row; there is none nearer to it than Princes-street.\r\n\r\n  “2013. It is stated that in some or other of those houses fever is\r\n  always prevalent; do you know the district so as to be aware whether\r\n  that is the case?—I cannot speak as to the state of the inhabitants; I\r\n  know it is very wretched. The whole of this land was excavated for\r\n  brick-making, and has been reduced to an unnatural level, so that the\r\n  sewers are hardly available. I believe many of those houses have\r\n  ditches round their gardens, and flowers and roots and stems are\r\n  thrown into the ditches, where they remain and stagnate; we are\r\n  working up, and shall be able to get the sewer in some parts five feet\r\n  lower than it was.\r\n\r\n  “2014. It is stated to the Commissioners that in Whitechapel parish,\r\n  Essex-street and its numerous courts, as Martin’s-court, Moor’s-court,\r\n  Essex-court, Elgar-square, George-yard, and New-court, Crown-court,\r\n  Wentworth-street, and many parts of that street, there is no sewer\r\n  passes up?—There is none.\r\n\r\n  “2015. Are the people very much in want of some mode of cleansing in\r\n  consequence?—It is the filthiest place which can be imagined.\r\n\r\n  “2316. Is it thickly inhabited?—Yes, very densely populated.\r\n\r\n  “2028. Do you not think that the want of such provision is very\r\n  injurious to the health of the inhabitants?—I do not think that sewers\r\n  have the effect which is attributed to them.\r\n\r\n  “2029. You disagree with the medical men who think that the neglect of\r\n  this underground drainage is prejudicial to the health of the\r\n  community?—I cannot see how, if they have a good surface drainage,\r\n  they can be improved by an underground drainage, in nine cases out of\r\n  ten.\r\n\r\n  “2064. Do you consider it your duty to alter a sewer, or carry up a\r\n  sewer, with reference to the health of the inhabitants?—Certainly not.\r\n\r\n  “2065. Any alteration in the form of the sewerage, or any change\r\n  respecting it, is with reference to property, not with reference to\r\n  the health of the inhabitants?- Certainly.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Unwin_, the clerk to the Commissioners of Sewers for the Tower\r\nHamlets, was thus examined before the Committee:—\r\n\r\n  “1433. Do you know Hare-street-fields?—I do; that is not very densely\r\n  populated: there are a number of houses, but very few persons living\r\n  in them.\r\n\r\n  “1434. Do you know that in wet weather a large portion of that\r\n  neighbourhood is completely inundated; that in all the houses forming\r\n  the square, and in the neighbouring streets, fever is constantly\r\n  breaking out, and that the character of the fever in the neighbourhood\r\n  has lately been very malignant?—I never heard that before.\r\n\r\n  “1435. Then if that has occurred in the midst of your district, it is\r\n  a matter you never heard of?—Just so.\r\n\r\n  “1436. Do you know Baker’s-Arms-alley?—That is in the parish of\r\n  Hackney; that is in our district; but it is a very open place.\r\n\r\n  “1437. If it is the fact that there is a narrow court with a dead wall\r\n  about two yards from the houses, as high as the houses; that the\r\n  principal court is intersected by other courts extremely narrow, in\r\n  which it is scarcely possible for air to penetrate close to the dead\r\n  wall; that between the wall and the houses there is a gutter, in which\r\n  is always present a quantity of stagnant fluid full of all sorts of\r\n  putrefying matter, the effluvia from which are most offensive, and the\r\n  sense of closeness extreme; that all the houses are dark, gloomy, and\r\n  extremely filthy; that at the top of the innermost courts are the\r\n  privies, which are open and uncovered, the soil of which is seldom\r\n  removed, and the stench of which is abominable; you have not heard of\r\n  that?—No, I have not heard of any of those circumstances; I have heard\r\n  of very few complaints of fever in the Tower Hamlets.\r\n\r\n  “1440. Do you not recollect that there are most fearful accounts of\r\n  fever prevailing in that district?—No, I had a report sent to me,\r\n  which I understood came from Dr. Southwood Smith, and there was a\r\n  communication I think from the Secretary of State upon it.”\r\n\r\nAt the very time that this witness had heard of few complaints of fever\r\nin the Tower Hamlets, the Board found themselves compelled, on account\r\nof the appalling prevalence of fever amongst the poor resident in that\r\ndistrict, to direct the special inquiry by Dr. Arnott, Dr. Kay, and Dr.\r\nSouthwood Smith, as to the causes of the fever which led to the present\r\nextended inquiry. The description given in the question of the narrow\r\ncourt, with the dead wall about two yards from the houses was taken from\r\none of those reports. That self-same court was the Bakers’-Arms alley,\r\nnamed in the preceding question; but instead of being situate, as\r\ndescribed by the witness, in the parish of Hackney, two or three miles\r\nfrom the office of the Commissioners of Sewers, it is in Rosemary-lane,\r\ndistant from that office only the length of a street, and that not a\r\nvery long one—Leman-street.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the escapes of gas from the sewers there is no one\r\npoint on which medical men are so clearly agreed, as on the connexion of\r\nexposure of persons to the miasma from sewers, and of fever as a\r\nconsequence. It appears that the evils of these escapes, on which\r\nseveral medical men to whose testimony we have alluded gave evidence\r\nbefore the Committee of 1834, may be prevented, and one of them prepared\r\na plan for this purpose. He states that the Commissioners having\r\nexpressed their doubts as to whether they were justified in trying the\r\nexperiment at the public expense, he said—\r\n\r\n  “Very well, gentlemen, I suppose you are quite right there; I will\r\n  enter into an undertaking with you to do it at my own expense, to a\r\n  limited extent, in any part that the surveyor of the sewers will say\r\n  he thinks it will fail; at the worst part that he can point out I will\r\n  try it; and moreover, in that undertaking I engaged to replace the\r\n  things in _statu quo_ if they failed. I entered into that\r\n  understanding, and, as I was given to understand, the parish sent\r\n  their bond, with a copy of the request, to the Commissioners. Some\r\n  time elapsed and I heard nothing of it, and in fact I thought the\r\n  thing was so simple, and as I heard nothing to the contrary, I began\r\n  to make inquiries as to getting these traps cast, when one morning the\r\n  parish surveyor brought me the model back, with a verbal message,\r\n  which was, that ‘whether it would answer or not, it should not be\r\n  tried;’ the Commissioners had made up their minds that the stink\r\n  should not be kept down.”\r\n\r\nThe reply made to this before the Committee on behalf of the\r\nCommissioners, by one of the officers, was, “The sewers must have vent\r\nsomewhere; if you stop the vent in the street, it will penetrate into\r\nthe houses; also the danger from the gas-explosions are continually\r\ntaking place, and our people are frequently sent to the hospital. Our\r\nsurveyor can show a specimen of an entire new skin to his hand, and he\r\nhad an entire new skin to his face, and laid up in a very dangerous\r\nstate. This was from an explosion in the sewers. This is a danger the\r\nCommissioners must of necessity look to.” “The gas always ascends from\r\nits lightness. If the air-trap was put at the upper end of the\r\ngully-drain, that would be the place where the gas would lodge, and any\r\ncandle brought near to this outlet into the upper part would occasion an\r\nexplosion.”\r\n\r\nNow it is precisely because “the gas always ascends from its lightness”\r\nthat men of competent science declare, without reference to the\r\nparticular plan proposed in this instance, that by means of a shaft or\r\nchimney properly placed, private houses as well as the workmen may be\r\nrelieved from the dangers of the escapes of this gas, which is becoming\r\nmore deleterious from the increasing drainage from private houses as\r\nwell as from the escapes of gas from the gas-pipes, into the sewers of\r\nwhich very strong instances are stated in the evidence.\r\n\r\nIn the map of Leeds, where the cholera track is pourtrayed, it will be\r\nobserved that it followed closely the fever track; and were such maps so\r\nfar improved as to show at a view the condition of a district in respect\r\nto dwelling and drainage, the marks to denote sites where the drainage\r\nwas imperfect would at the same time denote the seats of epidemic\r\ndisease. This had been so far observed by medical men that there was,\r\nperhaps, no point on which they were more anxious and urgent than that\r\nincreased sewerage and cleansing should be adopted as preventives of the\r\ncholera. Yet in one extensive densely populated district, the\r\nCommissioners, because they had observed no effects on their own men,\r\nwho were accustomed to the sewers, took upon themselves to disregard all\r\nthe precautions advised by persons of complete knowledge. “At the time\r\nof the cholera the arching over the sewers was very much applied for” in\r\nthe Ravensbourne Commission; “but,” says the officer of the commission,\r\n“I do not think there was anything done on account of the cholera,\r\nbecause the court held a different feeling on that point. Out of all the\r\nmen employed by the Commissioners of Sewers, and who were constantly in\r\nthose sewers, there was not one of those attacked by the cholera.”\r\n\r\nAll this incompleteness as to the extent of the districts drained, and\r\nthe imperfection in the mode of executing the works, appears from the\r\ncomplaints and evidence given before the Committee to be accompanied by\r\ndisproportionate and oppressive assessments and extravagant expenditure.\r\n\r\nThe rates were complained of as levied on property which was undrained,\r\nand derived no benefit from them; and by equal assessments on houses\r\nwhich derive benefit by direct communications with the sewers, and on\r\nhouses which have no communication with them, and only derive benefit\r\nfrom the surface drainage, and in some cases on houses which were\r\nunoccupied. These unequal charges, sometimes for long periods, and for\r\nlarge and permanent works, fell upon a fluctuating tenancy. “We should\r\nclaim,” says one witness, “20 years’ rate from the incoming tenant\r\n(122), or we might have sold the premises” (129).\r\n\r\nIn respect to the existing expenditure, very strong statements of\r\nmismanagement were made in the majority of the town districts; but I\r\nprefer referring on this topic to the evidence taken before the\r\nCommittee of the House of Commons. One marked character of the\r\nexpenditure is the greater amount paid to the clerk of the Board, and\r\nfor office expenses, than for any skill or science in the\r\nsuperintendence of the work. Thus in the district where the\r\nCommissioners, on the example of their own workmen, adjudged that the\r\napplications for arching over the sewers on the ground that they created\r\na predisposition to the spread of the epidemic were unfounded, the\r\npayments to the clerk of the Board for his salary and office was\r\n750_l._, assistant-clerk 100_l._, and three surveyors were paid each\r\n50_l._ (besides commission on works executed, and a fee of a guinea for\r\ncommunicating with the drain.) In another subdivision the expenses of\r\nthe clerks, messengers, &c., exclusive of collection, were 15,737_l._\r\nfor 20 years, while for the same period the expense of surveyors,\r\ninspectors, and clerks of the works was 14,928_l._ In another division\r\nthe tavern expenses for 20 years were 7,935_l._ In one district the cost\r\nof the commission, compared with the beneficial outlay on the works,\r\nappeared to be 200 per cent. In regard to another level, it is stated\r\nthat there was laid out on works the sum of 17,455_l._ 18_s._ 10_d._;\r\nand—\r\n\r\n                                          £.    _s._ _d._\r\n              In working the commission   9,003   18    7\r\n              Commission on collection    1,635   10   9½\r\n                                        ———————   ——   ——\r\n                        Total           £10,639    9   4½\r\n                                        =======   ==   ==\r\n\r\nThe proportion of the cost of management to the expenditure on work\r\nappears to have been similar in others of these administrative bodies.\r\nThe Committee stated as a principal defect of these bodies—“The want of\r\npublicity and responsibility systematically enforced.” There were\r\nseveral of the trusts in which the Courts have not been open to the\r\npublic, the right of the ratepayers to inspect the accounts not\r\nadmitted, and “where consequently a real responsibility in money matters\r\ncan hardly be said to exist.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. W. Fowler_, a Commissioner, says—\r\n\r\n  “If they are to go from year’s end to year’s end without being subject\r\n  to any control, I feel the money will be expended as I believe it now\r\n  is, and dribbled away, not expended fairly in carrying the ostensible\r\n  works into execution.”\r\n\r\nAnother defect resulting from the capricious constitution of these\r\ntrusts, on which the Committee reported, was the want of uniformity.\r\n\r\n  “There are no two districts in which the law does not vary, or where,\r\n  if the law be the same, the commissioners do not interpret some parts\r\n  of in a different manner.\r\n\r\n  “Thus, a man having property in Finsbury and in Westminster, or in the\r\n  City and in the Tower Hamlets, may find himself placed under different\r\n  systems, and may be led by his knowledge of the regulations of the one\r\n  district to violate the regulations of the other.”\r\n\r\nSuch being the unfavourable constitution of these bodies as described in\r\nthe Parliamentary Reports, and the evidence taken before the Committees,\r\nthe accounts given of the qualifications of many of the officers of\r\nthese trusts for the execution of any work of magnitude requiring\r\nscientific attainments are equally unfavourable. The following general\r\naccount of them is given by an architect of eminence, who has conducted\r\nlarge works in the metropolis and in various parts of the country, and\r\nis corroborated by several other engineers of extensive practice.\r\n\r\n  “In the rural districts, the men appointed as surveyors by the local\r\n  Commissioners are very little better than common labourers, men with\r\n  no idea of construction or of management; that is the description of\r\n  men I have met with in the country places: they are commonly a sort of\r\n  foremen of the labourers who are called ‘ditch casters.’ In the towns\r\n  the men appointed are frequently decayed builders, or tradesmen whose\r\n  knowledge is limited to common artificers’ work, such as bricklayers’\r\n  and carpenters’ work. Some may be capable of drawing: only a few. They\r\n  have neither education, nor salary, nor station, to place them above\r\n  bribery, and the consequences are notoriously such as might be\r\n  expected of public services performed by such an agency. In some\r\n  instances there are very good exceptions; that is, where the\r\n  remuneration is adequate to ensure the service of a respectable\r\n  persons, and where, as occasionally happens, a person of\r\n  respectability has the local influence to obtain the appointment. The\r\n  district surveyors in the metropolis are in general respectable and\r\n  well-qualified public officers. In local matters no thought is ever\r\n  had of combining duties. The chief concern of the Commissioner of\r\n  sewers, where he holds property of his own, is to drain his own\r\n  property.”\r\n\r\nAnother description of the persons usually appointed as surveyors is\r\ngiven in the following terms by a gentleman who is himself a surveyor of\r\nextensive practice:—\r\n\r\n  “As regards the appointment of surveyors to the Commissioners of\r\n  Sewers, I would observe that, in my opinion, very few of them are\r\n  properly qualified by education or otherwise to perform the important\r\n  duties entrusted to them in an effective and proper manner. A man to\r\n  be a good surveyor of sewers should be a practical civil engineer, in\r\n  which science is comprehended levelling in all its branches, and other\r\n  matters requisite and necessary in the construction of drains and\r\n  sewers: in proof of this, an instance recently occurred in one of the\r\n  divisions (which I need not particularize) in the construction of a\r\n  sewer, that after it had proceeded for a considerable distance, from\r\n  an error in taking the levels, was found to be below the level of the\r\n  outlet, and was in consequence obliged to be all destroyed, and\r\n  another sewer constructed upon a proper level. This error was so\r\n  clearly traced to the want of practical knowledge on the part of the\r\n  surveyor, or the application of it, that he was amerced in the greater\r\n  part of the cost.”\r\n\r\nA builder of extensive experience in the wealthy districts of the\r\nmetropolis states, that in making drains and executing works which\r\ncommunicate with the sewers on which large sums have been expended, he\r\nhas not found one main sewer in three properly made; and the strongest\r\nstatements of the extravagant nature of the expenditure was made by\r\nwitnesses who had themselves acted as members of the bodies directing\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe office business of two of the commissions appeared to me to be very\r\nrespectably conducted. But in the structural arrangements, in only one\r\ncommission do any of the works executed approach the existing state of\r\nscience. In that one, the Holborn and Finsbury trust, they happened to\r\nobtain a surveyor, having science and practical experience as an\r\nengineer, whose advice was acted upon, and that officer effected the\r\nonly considerable improvements of a scientific character that have been\r\nmade in the sewerage of the metropolis. These improvements for\r\npreventing the accumulations of deposits in the sewers, and the\r\ngeneration of malaria, and at the same time reducing the expenses of\r\ncleansing more than one-half, must be considered improvements of a very\r\nhigh order. But though they are demonstrated, and in full and successful\r\naction, they appear to have been imitated only in one other adjacent\r\ndistrict. In the others they go on constructing sewers which are the\r\nlatent sources of pestilence and death. This officer was asked the\r\nfollowing questions:—\r\n\r\n  “If the public, who may be ignorant of the science of sewerage and of\r\n  what it may accomplish, make no complaints, and do not call for the\r\n  adoption of any improved system, in how long a time do you think the\r\n  improvements demonstrated in the Holborn and Finsbury divisions would\r\n  reach the other ends of the metropolis by the force of imitation and\r\n  voluntary adoption?—From the apathy shown and prejudice against\r\n  anything new, however valuable it may be as an improvement, and the\r\n  various interests affected, such as the contractors for cleansing, I\r\n  do not expect that they would become general in the metropolis during\r\n  my life-time. The public are passive, and the adverse interests are\r\n  active.\r\n\r\n  “You know the description of persons engaged as surveyors of various\r\n  descriptions in the rural districts and in the smaller towns?—Yes, I\r\n  do.\r\n\r\n  “Unless care be taken, is it to be apprehended that any new\r\n  expenditure will be made on imperfect and unwholesome drains with flat\r\n  bottoms and on false principles at a disproportionate\r\n  expense?—Undoubtedly, except they have to act on rule, it will\r\n  certainly be so throughout the country. The drainage that I have seen\r\n  in the country districts is worse than in the metropolis.”\r\n\r\nThe consideration of these circumstances, in respect to the past\r\nexpenditure in this branch of local administration, appears to be\r\nnecessary for meeting the objections and opposition to any future\r\nexpenditure, and especially of any apparent increase required for the\r\nsuccessful removal of the physical causes of bodily suffering, and the\r\nmoral degradation of the labouring classes. In the towns and districts\r\nwhere the chief evils in question are admitted, but where anything\r\nwearing the appearance of a new expenditure for any purpose is\r\nunpopular, and will be thwarted or yielded unwillingly, the objections\r\nwhen examined are found to consist mainly of a rooted distrust of the\r\nmoney being equally levied, or carefully and efficiently expended for\r\nthe attainment of the professed objects of public advantage. From such\r\nevidence as that already adduced from the Report of the Committee of the\r\nHouse of Commons, but presented in greater extent and strength in the\r\ncourse of the present inquiry—of instances of disease and death\r\noccasioned by miasma from badly made and sluggish or stagnant drains\r\nthat pervade whole towns, it will be seen that it cannot fairly be said\r\nthat the distrust is not well founded.\r\n\r\nA due examination, however, of the experience even of voluntary and\r\nprivate expenditure on the wealthy districts where water is laid on, and\r\nthe main drainage is complete for the removal of refuse, appears to\r\nestablish the conclusion that only a part of the work is then attained,\r\nand that for the economical attainment of the general objects of\r\nprotecting the least protected classes, that which is generally deemed\r\nthe private and subordinate work, namely, the house drainage, must form\r\npart of the same general system, and be executed under the same general\r\nsuperintendence.\r\n\r\nIt appears to be partly a defect in legislation, and partly a defect in\r\nthe constitution of the existing authorities for the direction of public\r\ndrainage, that their agency is never thought of for the superintendence\r\neven of work which can seldom be cheaply and efficiently executed by\r\nprivate individuals, and that can only be so executed and kept in order\r\nby the systematic application of science and skill. An order, that the\r\nlandlords of all houses which have no drains communicating with the main\r\ndrains shall make them, is an order, when viewed in its operation in a\r\nstreet or district where there are 50 or 100 different owners, that\r\nthose 50 or 100 persons shall separately get plans possibly from as many\r\ndifferent builders, and enter into contracts with them, and procure\r\ncapital which, to poor owners, will be a serious amount of several\r\nhundred pounds in the aggregate, to be applied as a permanent investment\r\non property in which a large proportion of them will only have various\r\ntransitory interests. Viewed in its aggregate operation on all places\r\nrequiring amendment, the simple compulsory enactment for house drainage,\r\nand without any previous care as to the means, would be, in effect, an\r\norder for the expenditure of several millions of money in the manner\r\ndescribed by _Mr. Charles Oldfield_, a practical witness of great\r\nexperience, whose evidence (corroborated by the testimony of other\r\nwitnesses of extensive experience) has already been referred to on this\r\nimportant topic:—\r\n\r\n  “Have you as a builder had much experience in the drainage of\r\n  houses?—Very considerable experience, and I pay particular attention\r\n  to it; there is no part of a building to which I pay more attention\r\n  than to the drainage. I seldom allow the drains to be covered in\r\n  without seeing to them myself.\r\n\r\n  “Do you think it desirable that legislative provision should be made\r\n  for the drainage of the tenements of the labouring classes?—I think it\r\n  most necessary; but merely ordering the drains to be made will not do.\r\n  Drains made for the tenements of the working classes, if left to the\r\n  parties, are almost sure to be badly constructed, and badly\r\n  constructed drains might merely carry away the soil; they might not do\r\n  that; and they would probably let in as great an evil, namely, the\r\n  foul air from the sewer. In general, unless care be taken, what is\r\n  called making drains will be opening conduits for the escape of foul\r\n  air from the sewers into the houses. This is frequently so with the\r\n  houses of the better classes of persons, where the drains are not made\r\n  perfectly air-tight, and are not properly trapped at all the\r\n  apertures. I am frequently called upon to examine houses where they\r\n  say they are oppressed by unpleasant smells. Some time ago I was\r\n  called upon to examine a house in one of the principal streets in\r\n  London, belonging to a gentleman of distinction, who was about to\r\n  abandon it in consequence of the unpleasant smells which were\r\n  continually arising. He was particularly annoyed that this smell arose\r\n  in the greatest strength whenever he had parties; the drains had been\r\n  opened, and there was no lodgement of soil in them. People commonly\r\n  imagine that when they get rid of the soil they have got rid of the\r\n  stench; they do not see and do not conceive the effect of the foul\r\n  air, which is so much lighter than atmospheric air that it escapes\r\n  where the atmospheric air would not. On examining the drains at his\r\n  house, I found that they were imperfect, and that the foul air\r\n  filtered through them. Whenever he had a party there was a stronger\r\n  fire in the kitchen, and stronger fires in other parts of the house,\r\n  and the windows and the external doors being shut, and a greater\r\n  draught created, larger quantities of the foul air from the sewers\r\n  rose up. These stenches arise in the greatest strength in the private\r\n  houses when the doors and windows are closed, the fire and column of\r\n  light air in the chimney being at work. So it would be with drains\r\n  made from the house to the sewer, or from the sewer to the house of\r\n  the poor man, unless care were taken in the construction of the\r\n  drains. When the door was shut, and he sat down to enjoy his fireside,\r\n  he would have a stench. This would be the effect of merely ordering\r\n  the drains to be made by the owners of such tenements, who would get\r\n  the work done in the way they thought to be the least expensive. You\r\n  would have them made in a row of tenements with every difference in\r\n  faults,—different forms, different sizes, different falls, bad\r\n  materials, without traps at the apertures, and not air-tight;\r\n  therefore constantly conducting a stream of polluted air from the\r\n  sewers into the houses; and there will be faults which an inspector\r\n  will not easily remedy when work is done in this manner.\r\n\r\n  “In what way, then, would you recommend them to be done, for\r\n  efficiency?—They should be done entirely by the persons in charge of\r\n  the sewers, or under the control of officers of competent skill, who\r\n  should have power to enter upon the premises, and see that the whole\r\n  of the work was properly done. Neither should private persons have\r\n  power to make any alteration without giving notice, and making the\r\n  alteration according to well-tried and approved plans. I confine my\r\n  observations, however, to tenements of certain size,—to those for the\r\n  labouring man, who has no power to protect himself, and who stands in\r\n  need of protection. It might be deemed objectionable to exercise any\r\n  control over the higher class of tenements, and the wealthier people\r\n  are able to protect themselves; but all those things that are out of\r\n  sight are done in the worst manner in the smaller tenements.\r\n\r\n  “If such an authority were to contract for the drainage of a whole\r\n  street, how much more cheaply do you conceive the work might be done\r\n  under one contract than if the labour were to be done separately, by\r\n  perhaps as many different occupiers or owners as there are houses,\r\n  each employing his own bricklayer?—At the least, from 10 to 15 per\r\n  cent. difference. Serving a notice in writing on a poor occupier,\r\n  perhaps a shifting one, that he is to get a drain made, would be of no\r\n  use. Proceeding by serving notices on the owners of such tenements, is\r\n  a course beset with difficulties. Many of the small owners are not\r\n  readily to be found; the ownership to some of the poorest plots are in\r\n  dispute. Then, when the owners are found, every owner has to seek and\r\n  bargain with a bricklayer for what he does unwillingly, and whom he\r\n  tells to do the work in the cheapest way he can. The owner does not\r\n  usually know what instructions to give; and in nine cases out of ten\r\n  the work will be badly, and at the same time expensively done. It is\r\n  with the greatest difficulty that I can get the drains to my own\r\n  houses properly done. Frequent complaints are made of the state of the\r\n  sewers by occupants in some districts, but when they are examined it\r\n  is found, in many cases, that the cause of complaint arises from their\r\n  own drain not being properly made. The poorer or reluctant owner would\r\n  seek a cheap or needy bricklayer, and will get an expensive one.\r\n  Everything ordered of this kind may be made a job of; the bricklayer\r\n  may do more than is wanted, or may make larger drains than necessary,\r\n  and thereby incur useless expense. If it be done by the public\r\n  authorities, leaving to the private parties to do it if they please\r\n  within a limited period, under the inspection of a proper officer, it\r\n  can hardly fail to be much less expensively done for the private\r\n  individual himself, and it is very sure to be better done for the poor\r\n  owner. The certain obstacles to any mere general enactments to have\r\n  the work done by a multitude of persons will be immense, and the work\r\n  will certainly be badly done, whilst, if it is well done, it will be\r\n  of the greatest public advantage.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Roe_, the engineer, was asked, with reference to house drainage—\r\n\r\n  “Have you found the system of cleansing the large drains by flushing\r\n  with proper supplies of water equally applicable to small drains?—Yes,\r\n  equally applicable. A gentleman has tried it on a private drain of\r\n  18–inch capacity, and 1200 feet length, and it answers equally well.\r\n  It is cleansed by the collection of refuse water from 30 or 40 houses.\r\n\r\n  “Might not the drains from private houses be also cleansed in the same\r\n  mode?—Yes, they might have a small and cheap apparatus for carrying\r\n  away all ordinary refuse. If in the small drain a brick fell in, it\r\n  could not be removed by the force of the small quantity of water which\r\n  could be obtained in such a situation. In our large sewers the heads\r\n  of water are in some cases strong enough to sweep away loose bricks.\r\n\r\n  “Would it not be of advantage to the occupier if the private drains\r\n  were under the same general superintendence?—I conceive it would in\r\n  management. They are frequently put to great expense by getting\r\n  persons to attend to them who really do not understand them. They are\r\n  often now obliged to have recourse to the contractor’s men. Private\r\n  property is often drained through other private property, and when the\r\n  drains are choked, if the parties are not on good terms, they will not\r\n  allow each other facilities for cleansing. Under the Finsbury Local\r\n  Act there is a power to enforce the cleansing of private drains, and\r\n  by way of appeal that power is sometimes resorted to by private\r\n  individuals.\r\n\r\n  “May we not presume that the same principles of hydraulics, as to the\r\n  advantages of a flow over a semicircular bottom, are as applicable to\r\n  small drains as to large ones?—More so from the flow of water being\r\n  smaller; the greater necessity for keeping it in a body to enable it\r\n  to carry away the common deposit.\r\n\r\n  “Then there is a proportionate loss in having the private drainage\r\n  made with flat-bottomed bricks or boards?—Yes, there is proportionate\r\n  loss from the extra cost of cleansing. Semicircular drains of tiles\r\n  would be better, and cheaper than brick for private houses.”\r\n\r\nSupposing that only one-third of the existing tenements require\r\ndrainage, the saving of 15 per cent. on the expenditure by the execution\r\nof the work by contract under the superintendence of a responsible\r\nengineer would be more than 1,500,000_l._ sterling on the outlay,\r\nindependently of the difference in efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe necessity has previously been suggested of spreading the immediate\r\ncost over a number of years to make the charge coincident with the\r\nbenefit. Were it left to the option of individuals to repay the cost at\r\nintervals of 20 or 30 years, and charge their tenants, as described in a\r\nsupposed form of notice to them, which I have appended to illustrate the\r\npractical working of such a provision, (allowing them either to defray\r\nthe whole cost at once, or execute the work themselves, under proper\r\nsuperintendence; if they thought they could execute it cheaper,) the\r\nimmediate advantages of such improvements would then have some chance of\r\nbeing fairly estimated as against the immediate cost and inconveniences\r\nof a change, and resistance from latent motives of hostility would be\r\nobviated.\r\n\r\nBut however the charge may be diffused, and to whatever extent\r\nopposition on the part of the smaller owners may be obviated by care, it\r\ncannot safely be overlooked that in the poorest districts where it is\r\nmost important that the works should be well executed, the superior\r\ndirection of such expenditure will, in the ordinary course, fall into\r\nthe hands of the owners of the worst-conditioned tenements, who have the\r\ngreatest dread of immediate expenses, and who are under the strongest\r\ninfluence of petty jealousies; for in such districts it is precisely the\r\nclass of persons who cannot agree to profitable measures of private\r\ndrainage, who are the owners of the worst tenements, who, having leisure\r\nduring the intervals of their weekly collections, and from other causes,\r\nare most frequently found in honorary offices for the direction of local\r\nexpenditure. One officer, when asked how it was that in a district where\r\nfever had been rife nothing had been done under the authority of the\r\nlaw, which authorized its being cleansed? replied, that the Board had\r\nmade precisely the same objections that were made when the cholera\r\nappeared; when it was proposed to cleanse the district, the answer made\r\nat the Board was, that “they did not believe it would do any good:” and\r\nthose of the officers who were landlords of the weekly tenements said,\r\n“Why should we disturb and drive away our tenants?” and those who were\r\nshopkeepers said, “Why should we frighten away our customers by\r\nrepresenting the neighbourhood as unhealthy?” consequently nothing was\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nThe legislature, in making demands for such honorary services, has\r\nusually proceeded on the theory which views all those who may be called\r\nupon to render them, as persons qualified to understand the whole\r\nsubject intuitively, and having no other interest or views than to\r\nperform the services zealously for the common weal; whereas, in the\r\nlocality they are viewed in a totally different light, not as public\r\nofficers, but in their private capacities, as owners or tradesmen,\r\ncompetitors for advantages of various kinds. However unjust this\r\nimpression may frequently be, it is the impression that commonly\r\nprevails; and since all of one class cannot have a share in the\r\nadministration of such funds, others of the same class, whether owners\r\nor tradesmen, view the persons exercising the power as rivals, and\r\ndistrust their administration accordingly. As an owner, one member of a\r\nlocal Board is strongly indisposed to any line of operations that will\r\napparently improve the property of another; and as an owner, too, he is\r\nunder the strongest jealousy if he proposes or does anything which may\r\nappear to benefit his own property at the public expense.\r\n\r\nNeither is such distrust as to trustworthiness from skill and adverse\r\nprivate interests confined to the administration of the public works of\r\nsewerage and drainage; it is fortified by the example of the local\r\nadministration of the works of road construction and repair, a branch of\r\nadministration so inseparably connected with drainage operations, as to\r\njustify and require a joint consideration with them.\r\n\r\nWitnesses of the most extensive practical experience lay the greatest\r\nstress on the necessity of lifting these important branches of\r\nadministration out of the influence of petty and sinister interests, and\r\nof doing so by securing the appointment of officers of superior\r\nscientific attainments, who (subject to a proper local as well as\r\ngeneral control) may be made responsible for directing any new\r\nexpenditure on a scale of efficiency as well as of economy. A competent,\r\nscientific, and efficient management, let it be applied to what part of\r\nthese works it may, can scarcely fail to be immediately as well as\r\nultimately the most economical management. But it will be found on\r\nexamination that the consolidation of all the structural arrangements,\r\ncomprising under-drainage and surface-drainage, road structure and\r\nrepair, under one service, is most required for the sake of efficiency.\r\nDivision of labour in the arts derives its efficiency from combination,\r\nadaptation, and subordination to direction to one end; but that which\r\nappears to be a division of labour in local administration is, in fact,\r\nan insubordinate separation, weakening the means of procuring adequate\r\nskill and power, occasioning obstructions and defective execution, and\r\nenhancing expense. Were pins or machines made as sewers and roads are\r\nconstructed; shafts of pins would be made without reference to heads,—in\r\nmachines screws would be made without sockets, and, it may be\r\nconfidently stated, there would not be a safe or perfect and\r\nwell-working machine in the whole country.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Telford_, in a report on the Holyhead road, makes the following\r\nobservations:—\r\n\r\n  “Perfect management must be guided by rules and regulations, and these\r\n  must be carried into effect by the unceasing attention of a judicious\r\n  and faithful surveyor who has by actual experience and attention\r\n  acquired a thorough knowledge of all that is required, and applicable\r\n  to the general and local state of particular districts, as regards\r\n  soil, materials, and climate; likewise the sort of wear to which the\r\n  surface is liable. A person possessed of all these requisites, and\r\n  otherwise properly qualified to level and set out new lines, &c.,\r\n  where necessary, must receive the remuneration such a character\r\n  merits, and may always obtain, in this active and industrious country.\r\n  But however convinced and well-disposed trustees maybe to give this\r\n  remuneration, the tolls of five or six miles do not afford the means\r\n  of giving it. The consequence is that the Shifnal Trust (four miles)\r\n  has hitherto been under the management of a person so little\r\n  acquainted with proper road business, that it becomes a serious\r\n  consideration whether it will be prudent to suffer the extensive\r\n  improvement at Priors Leigh to be entrusted to his care. Until the\r\n  Parliamentary Commissioners interfered and showed a practical example,\r\n  the Wellington Trust (seven miles) was managed almost wholly by the\r\n  clerk; he had a sort of foreman, who appeared to be only partly\r\n  employed on the road. And on the Shrewsbury Trust (seven miles), as\r\n  has already been stated, the surveyor and contractor were united in\r\n  the same person. All these managers proceeded, without regard to any\r\n  rules and regulations whatever, receiving only occasional directions\r\n  from some of the most active of the trustees, whose varying opinions\r\n  served more to distract than benefit the practical operations of the\r\n  workmen. I must beg leave to add that these observations are\r\n  applicable to all trusts of similar extent, and are evidences of the\r\n  propriety of establishing districts of a magnitude to justify a more\r\n  perfect arrangement, and the employing of a properly qualified\r\n  surveyor, whose sole occupation should be the road under his care, and\r\n  who should also be enabled to keep constantly employed a set of\r\n  workmen thoroughly conversant with road observations, and working\r\n  chiefly by contract.”—_First Annual Report on the Holyhead Road_, May\r\n  4, 1824. p. 25.\r\n\r\nIt need scarcely be necessary to observe that in the sense of that great\r\nengineer, care of the road implied the greatest care in respect to the\r\ndrainage. In consequence of the limited areas of management, although\r\ngreat expense is incurred, the appointments of the surveyors to\r\nsuperintend works which are never well executed by any other than an\r\nexperienced engineer, are inferior even to the appointments of the paid\r\nofficers to superintend the sewerage. _Sir Henry Parnell_ in his work,\r\n“On the Formation and Management of the Public Roads,” thus\r\ncompendiously describes the composition of the chief bodies by whom\r\nthese officers are chosen and directed:—\r\n\r\n  “According to the provisions of every Turnpike Act, a great number of\r\n  persons are named as trustees; the practice is to make almost every\r\n  one a trustee, residing in the vicinity of a road, who is an opulent\r\n  farmer or tradesman, as well as all the nobility and persons of large\r\n  landed properly: so that a trust seldom consists of fewer than 100\r\n  persons, even it the length of the road to be maintained by them does\r\n  not exceed a few miles. The result of this practice is, that in every\r\n  set of trustees there are to be found persons who do not possess a\r\n  single qualification for the office, persons who conceive they are\r\n  raised by the title of a road trustee to a station of some importance,\r\n  and who too often seek to show it by opposing their superiors in\r\n  ability and integrity when valuable improvements are under\r\n  consideration, taking care, too frequently, to turn their authority to\r\n  account, by so directing the spending of the road money as may best\r\n  promote the interests of themselves or their connexions.\r\n\r\n  “It sometimes happens that if one trustee, more intelligent and more\r\n  public-spirited than the rest, attempts to take a lead, and proposes a\r\n  measure in every way right and proper to be adopted, his ability to\r\n  give advice is questioned, his presumption condemned, his motives\r\n  suspected; and as every such measure will, almost always, have the\r\n  effect of defeating some private object, it is commonly met either by\r\n  direct rejection or some indirect contrivance for getting rid of it.\r\n  In this way intelligent and public-spirited trustees become disgusted,\r\n  and cease to attend meetings; for, besides frequently experiencing\r\n  opposition and defeat at the hands of the least worthy of their\r\n  associates, they are annoyed by the noise and language with which the\r\n  discussions are carried on, and feel themselves placed in a situation\r\n  in which they are exposed to insult and ill-usage.”\r\n\r\nHe observes, that “Although this turnpike system has led to the making\r\nof many new roads, and to the changing of many old ones into what may be\r\ncalled good roads in comparison with what they formerly were, this\r\nsystem has been carried into execution under such erroneous regulations,\r\nand the persons who have been entrusted with the administration of them\r\nhave uniformly been either so negligent or so little acquainted with the\r\nbusiness of making or repairing roads, that at this moment it may be\r\nstated with the utmost correctness that there is not a road in England,\r\nexcept those recently made by some eminent civil engineers, which is not\r\nextremely defective in the most essential qualities of a perfect road.”\r\nTo the varying extent of these defects the public are forced to ascend\r\nunnecessary heights, travel unnecessary distances, employ more\r\nhorse-labour than would be necessary in travelling over roads that are\r\nkept hard, dry, and level, instead of wet, soft, and rugged. From the\r\nReport of the Commissioners appointed to inquire into the subject, it\r\nappears that for every 200 miles of turnpike road there are, on an\r\naverage, ten surveyors: whereas, if the highways and turnpike trusts\r\nwere consolidated, one properly qualified surveyor might perform much\r\nbetter the service with which the ten are charged. There are, it\r\nappears, 1,116 turnpike trusts, comprehending about 22,000 miles. The\r\nofficers employed consist of 1,120 treasurers, 1,135 clerks, and 1,300\r\nsurveyors: total, 3,555. The annual cost of the _repair_ of the turnpike\r\nroads is 51_l._ per mile: total expenditure of 1,122,000_l._ per annum.\r\nThe debts amounted to upwards of 9,000,000_l._ and they appeared to be\r\nrapidly increasing. The average expense of the _management_ of the\r\nhighway and the turnpike roads is estimated at 10_l._ per mile per\r\nannum; but it is calculated that if the management of the turnpikes and\r\nhighways were consolidated, they might be better managed at an expense\r\nof from 30_s._ to 2_l._ per mile per annum. On comparing the actual\r\nexpense of the repairs of roads under a scientific management of the\r\nhighways with the common cost, it appears probable that by management on\r\nan extended and appropriate scale, upwards of 500,000_l._ per annum may\r\nbe saved on that branch of administration alone.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of the House of Commons, which sat in 1834, examined some\r\nof the most able engineers in the country, and a Commission subsequently\r\nappointed, at the head of which were the Duke of Richmond and the\r\nMarquis of Salisbury, coincided in recommending the adoption of the\r\nprinciple of consolidation as the only means of retrieving that branch\r\nof administration.\r\n\r\nI venture humbly to submit the grounds for the opinion in which I\r\nbelieve their Lordships would concur, that the principle of\r\nconsolidation may be carried still further, and include all public works\r\nwithin the locality, as the best means of obtaining for each or for all,\r\nat the least expense, the most efficient scientific direction.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown, in respect to drainage as well as road construction,\r\nthat the economy and efficiency of the works will be according to the\r\nqualifications, the powers, and responsibilities of the officers\r\nappointed to execute them, secured by legislative means, and that new\r\nlabour on the old condition, without skill, will be executed in the old\r\nmanner, extravagantly and inefficiently. But engineers or properly\r\nqualified officers having the science of civil engineering could not be\r\nprocured for every separate purpose in every part of the country, as is\r\ngenerally assumed in Acts of Parliament for effecting particular\r\nobjects. When such connected work is divided and separated, the\r\nremuneration necessary to obtain properly qualified officers to attend\r\nto the fragment of service is too high; the separation, therefore, in\r\nmost places, amounts to the exclusion of science from public work, or,\r\nin other words, to its degradation. It will be found, when the works of\r\ndraining and road making and maintenance are examined, that the common\r\npractice of making sewers on plans independently of the construction of\r\nroads, and roads independently of the arrangements for cleansing and\r\nkeeping them dry, is always to the disadvantage of the work and to the\r\npublic. The same surface levels and surveys serve for drainage and for\r\nroad construction. The construction of the drains for roads and streets,\r\nand the maintenance of them, are the primary and most important works;\r\nthe construction and maintenance of the surface of the road is a\r\nconnected work, subsequent in order, and can be best superintended by\r\nthe same officer. In every part of the country inconveniences and losses\r\nare experienced from the separation of such work on almost every\r\noccasion where repair or new construction is needed. In the towns a road\r\nis broken up by the bursting of a sewer or the necessity of cleansing or\r\nrepairing it; the sewer is repaired, but the road is left broken,\r\nbecause the road surveyor and his separate set of workmen are engaged in\r\nsome other work. In the metropolis, the breaches left in the roads by\r\nthe delay and want of concert amongst the various officers are a source\r\nnot only of great obstruction but of frequent accidents. In replacing\r\nthe pavements the water and the gas-pipes are not unfrequently put out\r\nof order, and these again occasion another opening and another expense\r\nto the public, for repairs. In the rural districts a road is out of\r\nrepair, but the first remedy is drainage; the road surveyor cannot\r\nproceed because the sewers’ surveyor has his men elsewhere occupied. In\r\nvarious other particulars the consolidation of the same work under the\r\nsame officer, acting with a combined staff of foremen and workmen, is\r\nattended with advantages in efficiency and economy to which it were\r\nunnecessary to advert, if the opposite arrangements were not the most\r\nfrequent. In the few instances that have taken place of a combination of\r\nduties, the experience of the advantages of the combination would\r\noccasion a proposal for separating them to be viewed as an increase of\r\ntrouble and expense, and a hinderance to the proper execution of the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIn the districts where the greatest defects prevail, we find such an\r\narray of officers for the superintendence of public structures as would\r\nlead to the _à priori_ conclusion of a high degree of perfection in the\r\nwork from the apparent subdivision of labour in which it is distributed.\r\nIn the same petty districts we have surveyors of sewers appointed by the\r\ncommissioners of sewers, surveyors of turnpike-roads appointed by the\r\ntrustees of the turnpike trusts, surveyors of highways appointed by the\r\ninhabitants in vestry, or by district boards under the Highway Act; paid\r\ndistrict surveyors appointed by the justices, surveyors of paving under\r\nlocal Acts, surveyors of building under the Building Act, surveyors of\r\ncounty bridges, &c.\r\n\r\nThe qualifications of a civil engineer involve the knowledge of the\r\nprices of the materials and labour used in construction, and also the\r\npreparation of surveys, and the general qualifications for valuations,\r\nwhich are usually enhanced by the extent of the range of different\r\ndescriptions of property with which the valuator is conversant. The\r\npublic demands for the services of such officers as valuators are often\r\nas mischievously separated and distributed as the services for the\r\nconstruction and maintenance of public works. Thus we have often, within\r\nthe same districts, one set of persons appointed for the execution of\r\nvaluations and surveys for the levy of the poor’s rates; another set for\r\nthe surveys and valuations for the assessed taxes; another for the land\r\ntax; another for the highway rates; another for the sewers’ rates;\r\nanother for the borough rates; another for the church rates; another for\r\nthe county rates, where parishes neglect to pay, or are unequally\r\nassessed, and for extra-parochial places; another for tithe commutation.\r\nAnd these services are generally badly rendered separately at an undue\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nIt is in the ordinary course that local bodies would have the power of\r\nappointing surveyors for seeing to the execution of provisions for the\r\nregulation of buildings, on the precedent of the Metropolitan Building\r\nAct; and these officers are paid by fees varying from 1_l._ to 3_l._\r\n10_s._ each building. In the towns, it is rare that one-story houses are\r\nerected where the ground is of much value; and it will be a low average\r\nto take all the new houses as of two stories, that, is, fourth-rate\r\nhouses, for which a fee of 2_l._ has been proposed to be paid. Before\r\nthe building surveyor can proceed, the sewers’ surveyor must have seen\r\nthat the drains are properly laid, and the builder have obtained a\r\ncertificate from him to that effect. The labour of the budding surveyor,\r\nif properly performed, may require as much as an hour for the inspection\r\nof each new building. But the amount of the proposed fee would in\r\ngeneral more than pay, in ordinary cases, for the construction of an\r\nefficient drain for such a tenement. Any speculating builder who is\r\nbuilding a fourth-rate street of fifty houses, would, by removing out of\r\nthe limits of the jurisdiction, save by the removal the means of\r\nerecting an additional house or drains for the whole of them.\r\n\r\nNo past or proposed legislative measures prescribe any securities for\r\nappropriate skill, or trustworthiness for the performance of such\r\nservices. It is matter of complaint in one extensive district in the\r\nmetropolis, that the duty of examining the premises is performed by\r\nyoung men, junior clerks to the district surveyor.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as science is securely allied to local administration is\r\nits respectability enhanced and the attainment of its objects ensured.\r\nIt is dangerous to legislate in detail, for the information is not\r\nusually available for legislative preparation against all existing local\r\ndifficulties, still less all future important contingencies. Where\r\ndetailed regulations are prescribed arbitrarily, the danger is incurred\r\nof creating an obstacle to the work intended to be forwarded. For\r\nexample, it has been proposed that Parliament shall not only provide\r\n“That every outer wall of every building shall be built of good, sound,\r\nwell-burnt, bricks, or good sound stone, and set in good mortar,” but\r\nshall direct and instruct the builders, and fix, against any alteration\r\nor improvement, the mode in which good mortar shall be made, viz., “And\r\nthe mortar and cement shall be _well_ compounded in the proportion of\r\n_one_ part of good fresh-burnt lime or cement, and _three_ parts of\r\nclean sharp sand;” there, however, are large tracts of country where\r\nneither clean sand, nor sharp sand, nor sand of any sort is to be had,\r\nand where they use smiths’ ashes for the purpose. But the use of this\r\nmaterial is thenceforward illegal, and no new discovery can be adopted\r\nwithout the sanction of an Act of Parliament. In one large parish it was\r\nlately desired to try a pavement of wood, when it was discovered that\r\nthe local Act prescribed the use of granite for pavement. In the\r\nimpracticability of carrying out all such detail, or from default of\r\ndefining the ends and prescribing the attainment instead of the means,\r\nor stating the means generally, as that a wall shall be built “of\r\nincombustible materials,” it is in the usual course to require that\r\nimportant work shall be done in such manner as “shall be satisfactory to\r\nthe surveyor who shall inspect the same,” or “according to the\r\ndirections of the surveyor of the district;” _e. g._, that no chimney\r\nshall be built more than six feet high, “unless the same shall be\r\nsecured by sufficient iron stays of such strength and dimensions, and to\r\nbe fixed in such manner as shall be approved of by the surveyor who\r\nshall inspect the building.” The objections entertained by builders of\r\nrespectability to the granting of such large powers, is founded on the\r\ncertainty as to the character of the appointments of surveyors to be\r\nhereafter made if no other securities than mere general directions be\r\ntaken in respect to them for the public protection. It may be a rival\r\nbuilder who is appointed, and it is very certain to be generally a\r\nperson in trade by whom the power is exercised, whose dissatisfaction\r\nwith work really fair and good may be governed by sinister\r\nconsiderations against which a fair builder will feel he has no defence;\r\nbut the greater danger is to the public, that no dissatisfaction may be\r\nexpressed with work that is cheap but unsound. The building covers bad\r\ndrains, and hides rotten walls, and the effects in the calamities of\r\nspreading fires and falling houses, and calamities of sufferings, and\r\ndeaths, occur in after years, when the original defect may not be\r\ndetected by the closest examination, and when all concerned may have\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\nIf the services of men of independent position, with the science and\r\nqualifications of engineers, were secured, their inspection of works\r\nwould often be invited, and the notice they could not fail to take of\r\nunintentional and profitless errors, such as wrong levels, which detract\r\nfrom the convenience and value of tenements, would be of much value and\r\nbe received cordially, and the exercise of discretionary authority in\r\nsuch hands would meet with comparatively respectful obedience.\r\n\r\nNo one can have had occasion to examine much of the business of local\r\nadministration, without being aware of other evils entailed by the\r\nmultiplication of badly appointed officer’s in addition to the evils of\r\nexcessive cost and bad quality of the service to the ratepayers. One of\r\nthe evils is the fuel they add to the flames of local parties, by which\r\nboth parties are generally losers. Where special and scientific\r\nqualifications are not defined, or, if defined, not secured—where the\r\nmost fatal errors, as in this instance, are shrouded by the nature of\r\nthe work from detection—all the idle dependents of election committees\r\nwho have time to spare, because they have failed in their own business\r\nfor want of steady application, and because their time is worthless, are\r\nlet in as candidates, and in proportion to the absence of security for\r\nqualifications is the extent of expectation created and disappointment\r\nensured. The dreadful state of the labouring classes in the most\r\nimportant towns,—the entire neglect of existing sanitary\r\nregulations,—the apathy to repeated remonstrances that have been made by\r\neminent medical practitioners, as by Dr. Ferrier in Manchester and by\r\nDr. Currie of Liverpool,—the entire neglect of recommendations made by\r\nthem, which, if carried out, would have protected those communities from\r\nimmense burdens, from pestilence and slaughters worse than many wars,\r\nand from an enfeebled, diseased, and, by physical causes, a degraded\r\ngeneration of workpeople,—the resistance made from no other manifest\r\ncause than a blind jealousy of interference, to the exercise of powers\r\nthat can have no other object than to prevent the like evils for the\r\nfuture,—all indicate the conclusion as to the nature of the arrangements\r\nto be expected from those who have by familiarity become insensible to\r\nthe means of preventing the evils which fall with the greatest weight on\r\nthe least protected classes.\r\n\r\nSupposing population and new buildings for their accommodation to\r\nproceed at the rate at which they have hitherto done in the boroughs,\r\nand supposing all the new houses to be only fourth rate, the expense, at\r\nthe ordinary rate of payment of surveyors’ fees, would be about\r\n30,000_l._ per annum for the new houses alone. Fees of half the amount\r\nrequired for every new building are allowed for every alteration of an\r\nold one, and the total expense of such structures would probably be near\r\n50,000_l._ in the towns alone—an expense equal to the pay of the whole\r\ncorps of Royal Engineers, or 240 men of science, for Great Britain and\r\nIreland.[43]\r\n\r\nBut at the rate of increase of the population, of Great Britain, which\r\nis 230,000 per annum, (_i. e._ equal in population to the annual\r\naddition of a new county, such as Worcester or the North Riding of\r\nYorkshire,[44] and to accommodate them 59,000 new tenements are\r\nrequired, or a number equal to that of two new towns annually such as\r\nManchester proper, which has 32,310 houses, and Birmingham, which has\r\n27,268 houses,) affording, if all that have equal need receive equal\r\ncare, fees to the amount of no less than from 80,000_l._ to 100,000_l._\r\nper annum. This would afford payment equal to that of the whole corps of\r\nsappers and miners, or nearly 1000 trained men, in addition to the corps\r\nof engineers.\r\n\r\nFrom a consideration of the science and skill now obtained for the\r\npublic from these two corps for general service, some conception may be\r\nformed of the science and skill that might be obtained in appointments\r\nfor local service, by pre-appointed securities for the possession of the\r\nlike qualifications, but which are now thrown away in separate\r\nappointments at an enormous expense, where qualifications are entirely\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the engineer corps have the execution and care of\r\nstructural works, docks and dock-yards, fortifications, military roads,\r\nand barracks, in addition to the ordinary military duties. One captain\r\nof engineers fills the office of hydraulic engineer to the Admiralty,\r\nand to his superintendence is intrusted the construction and repairs of\r\nall the docks, buildings, and other public works.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the engineers have been distinguished for their services\r\non some of the most important civil commissions. As collateral services\r\nwhich they have rendered to the public, may be mentioned the\r\ntrigonometrical survey of Ireland, and that now in progress for England\r\nunder the Board of Ordnance, and also the geological survey. The\r\nlevelling, however, and the whole of the detail of the trigonometrical\r\nsurvey in England, is taken by the privates, corporals, and sergeants of\r\nthe corps of sappers and miners, who have been instructed in geometry,\r\ndrawing, and mensuration at the school at Chatham. The triangulation for\r\nthe detail of this work is executed by the engineer officers under the\r\ndirection of the superintendent of the survey, Colonel Colby. The great\r\nmajority of the surveys obtained under the Parochial Survey and\r\nValuation Act from private surveyors have been inferior to the surveys\r\nexecuted under superintendence by the privates and non-commissioned\r\nofficers of the sappers and miners serving at a pay of from 1_s._ 2_d._\r\nto 3_s._, per diem. Out of 1700 first-class maps received under the\r\nParochial Assessment and Tithe Acts, not more than one-half displayed\r\nqualifications for the execution of public surveys without\r\nsuperintendence. Amongst the most satisfactory maps of the first class\r\nof parochial surveys were those executed by a retired sergeant of\r\nsappers and miners. The Commissioners for the colonization of South\r\nAustralia found it difficult to proceed satisfactorily with persons of\r\nthe ordinary qualifications of surveyors or civil engineers for that\r\ncountry; and deemed it requisite to obtain the services of an engineer\r\nofficer, with a suitable number of trained men, sappers and miners,\r\nunder his command.\r\n\r\nBut for the construction and care of local works, sewers, roads, and\r\ndrains and houses, no qualification whatsoever is usually conceived to\r\nbe requisite. The chairman of the Holborn and Finsbury Commission of\r\nSewers, where a change of management so beneficial to the health, and so\r\neconomical of the funds of the ratepayers, was obtained by placing the\r\nwork under the direction of an engineer, informed me that when that\r\ncommission advertised for a person to act as surveyor to the works who\r\nunderstood the use of the spirit level, the candidates, who were nearly\r\nall common housebuilders, were greatly surprised at the novel demand,\r\nand several of them began to learn the use of that instrument in order\r\nto qualify them for the appointment. In the canvassing letters which I\r\nhave seen for parochial or local surveyorships, I never observed\r\nqualifications for skill or science even adverted to; and where a\r\nspecial qualification happens to be prescribed by statute, it is not\r\nregarded. For example, the Act of the 5 and 6 _Wm._ IV. enables the\r\nparochial vestries to appoint as surveyor a person of “skill and\r\nexperience” to serve the office of surveyor of such parish. As an\r\nexample of this description of appointments, I may mention one where, in\r\nan important district, the person appointed was an illiterate tinman, a\r\nleading speaker at parish meetings, who, for a service occupying a part\r\nof his time, receives a salary of 150_l._ per annum, _i. e._, as much as\r\na lieutenant of engineers and a private, or as much as three sergeants\r\nof sappers and miners, whose whole time is devoted to the public\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe mode in which such emoluments are at present wasted in the course of\r\nadministration under the Building Acts, and the extent of science and\r\nskill that might be obtained for all purposes by the same amount of\r\nmoney, may be seen by the rate of surveyors’ emoluments for a single\r\ntown. I submit, for example, the town of Leeds. There the average rate\r\nof increase of houses having been 855 per annum, and of families 940, it\r\nmay be assumed that they will continue to increase at the same rate,\r\nthat is, of two new houses and three-tenths per diem, which, if they\r\nwere only fourth-rate houses, would be required to pay in fees 4_l._\r\n12_s._ per diem for two or three hours’ service at the ordinary rate of\r\npayment to private surveyors. If we bear in mind the evidence as to the\r\ncharacter of the past appointments, and of the works themselves, and\r\nconsider that, where no securities are taken for qualifications, none\r\nwill be found except by accident, the contrast with the payment for the\r\nservices of men of superior qualifications will be clearly perceived.\r\nSuch an amount of emolument would defray the expense of a whole Board of\r\nsuperior officers at the rate of pay to the officers of the corps of\r\nengineers:—\r\n\r\n                          _Board of Officers._\r\n\r\n                                                 £.  _s._ _d._\r\n           1 Colonel                               1    6    3\r\n           1 Lieutenant-colonel                    0   18    1\r\n           2 Captains, at 11_s._ 1_d._             1    2    2\r\n           2 First lieutenants, at 6_s._ 10_d._    0   13    8\r\n           2 Second ditto, at 5_s._ 7_d._          0   11    2\r\n                                                  ——   ——   ——\r\n                                                   4   11    4\r\n\r\nOr if unity of direction and execution were required, the staff of\r\nofficers and men at the rate of pay for general service from the public\r\nwould be as follows. The rate of pay therein stated is subsistence pay:\r\nthe half-fees for every alteration made in a building would in most\r\ncases suffice for the extra pay given to officers and men in active\r\nservice:—\r\n\r\n                                                 £.  _s._ _d._\r\n           1 Captain                               0   11    1\r\n           2 First lieutenants                     0   13    8\r\n           3 Second ditto                          0   16    9\r\n           1 Colour-sergeant                       0    3   0½\r\n           3 Sergeants, at 2_s._ 6½_d._            0    7   7½\r\n           6 Corporals, at 2_s._ 2½_d._            0   13    3\r\n          22 Privates, at 1_s._ 2½_d._             1    6    7\r\n                                                  ——   ——   ——\r\n                                                   4   12    0\r\n\r\nThe high rates of remuneration ordinarily given for fragments of\r\npractically irresponsible service, would not only serve to defray the\r\nexpense of direction by scientific officers, but of execution by trained\r\nsubordinate officers.\r\n\r\nThe following return will afford a display of the comparative rate of\r\nemoluments in other towns from fees on the ordinary scale of surveyors’\r\nfees:—\r\n\r\n               Rate of       Rate of     No. of New        Rate of\r\n             Increase of   Increase of   Houses per    Surveyors’ Fees\r\n            Families per   Houses per       Diem.       per Diem for\r\n               Annum.

If scientific officers be chosen for this one\r\npurpose, if the objectionable mode of remuneration by fees be preserved,\r\nsince they are required to inspect the foundations of houses for the\r\npurpose of drainage, they might for one-fourth of the proposed fee be\r\nrequired to give inspection to the remainder of the work, and the\r\nprocess of double certificates and divided responsibility be saved. Even\r\nif the amount of work were in particular places too great to be\r\nperformed by one person, it would be better, and less expensive, that it\r\nshould be performed by him through an assistant, for whose defaults he\r\nshould be responsible. A reduction of the accustomed fees to one-fourth,\r\nor of the aggregate emoluments obtainable under a general Building Act\r\nto 15,000_l._ or 20,000_l._ per annum would still entail the loss of so\r\nmuch money that might serve to secure superior scientific service;\r\nwhilst in the less populous districts the payment for the separate duty\r\nof verifying the fact of compliance with the provisions of the Act would\r\nbe too small to ensure the service of competent and responsible\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nBesides the evils inherent in narrow districts, and the splitting of\r\nconnected functions which prevent the application of science by\r\npreventing the appointment of scientific officers, there are other evils\r\nattendant on such small jurisdictions and separation of functions,\r\nnamely, in the mode in which the money for such expenditure is levied.\r\nThe popular jealousy is excited by the further multiplication of\r\nunnecessary offices, as of clerks and collectors, but real annoyance is\r\ngiven by the consequent increased expense of separate collections. The\r\nprevalent repugnance to direct taxation in any shape has hitherto been\r\ngreatly owing to the cause of grievances experienced in the number and\r\noppressiveness of the collections incidental to the ordinary local\r\ntaxation. Those collections confuse and obstruct the rate payers’\r\neconomy. Where there are a number of rates collected at different\r\nperiods, some are forgotten and not provided for; and when demanded,\r\nthey fall with the inconvenience and create the irritation of a new tax.\r\nThe householder may have paid the collector of his poor’s rates, then\r\nthe collector of his assessed taxes, then the collector of the land tax,\r\nthen the collector of the watch rates, then the collector of his paving\r\nrates, then his lighting rates, then his water rates, and then he thinks\r\nhe has done, when a collector calls to demand the payment of the church\r\nrates; he may have paid him, when another collector appears to demand\r\nthe payment of a sewers’ rate for two years, probably for the period of\r\na former tenant, and for which the tenant on whom the demand is levied\r\nreceives no apparent advantage. A witness says[45] (2231), “In Limehouse\r\nthere had not been a sewer built for 100 and odd years, and there are\r\n2000 houses, and not a sewer to them.” Another states (2066), “In one\r\ncase a sewer rate of 6_d._ in the pound was levied for 10 years, without\r\neven surface drainage;” and in that case the party paid another rate to\r\na trust for paving, lighting, and making drainage. “We could claim six\r\nyears,” says another witness (860); “three years’ rates in arrear, as\r\nagainst former occupiers, were levied on the incoming tenants” (1798).\r\n\r\nIn a house receiving no benefit, the occupier, having refused to pay the\r\nrate ten years, and having paid it but once in 1827, the commissioners,\r\nwhen he left (1834) the house, “distrained on the new comer, and tore\r\ndown the corn-bin,” &c. His solicitor previously wrote to them that the\r\noccupier was out of town, and wished them to abstain from taking any\r\nviolent measures, at the same time offering on his part to refer the\r\nmatter to any competent person (2328). In another case of aggravated\r\nproceeding, Mr. William Baker, who was clerk to a like commission,\r\ncomplained of the state of the sewerage, and of the rates in another\r\ncommission. He did not resist the rate, “for he knew very well what the\r\npowers of the commissioners are, and it was not worth his while to\r\nresist so strong a body.” The assessments of sewers’ rates are seldom\r\nstrictly legal.\r\n\r\nSuch rates, being small in amount, they are levied at long intervals,\r\nfor the collection at once of a sum sufficient to defray the expense of\r\ncollection; and because they are collected at long intervals, the\r\nirritation and resistance and trouble is great, and an additional sum is\r\npaid by the public for the collector’s share of the trouble of the\r\ncollection. For the collection of the assessed taxes 3_d._ in the pound\r\nis paid; for the collection of the sewers’ rates from 6_d._ to 1_s._ in\r\nthe pound is usually paid. I venture to state, that by a consolidation\r\nof the collection of such charges, enough may be saved of money\r\n(independently of the saving of oppression and irritation) from the\r\ncollection of the one local tax, the sewers’ rate, to pay the expense of\r\nthe services of scientific officers throughout the country. At present\r\nthe high constable collects the county rate from every parish, and\r\ncarries it to the county treasurer, in the county town, and charges for\r\nthe expense of a journey. By an easy alteration, by payment by cheques\r\nfrom the union treasurer to the county treasurer, in one county (Kent)\r\n1000_l._ per annum might be saved, or enough to defray the immediate\r\nexpense of constructing permanent drains for upwards of 500 tenements.\r\nWhat might be gained on this head for immediate expenditure, in most\r\ntowns, will be shown in the following extract, from the evidence of _Mr.\r\nSimkiss_, the auditor of the Wolverhampton union:—\r\n\r\n  What are the amounts of the chief local rates collected, in round\r\n  numbers?—The poor’s rates are about 4000_l._, the highway rates about\r\n  2000_l._, and there are rates levied by commissioners under a local\r\n  Act for lighting, watching, and improving the town, amounting to about\r\n  3000_l._ in round numbers.\r\n\r\nOn his admission of the practicability of combining with advantage the\r\nsuperintendence of all this expenditure by one Board in such a town, a\r\ncombination of which there are several examples, he observes:—\r\n\r\n  The greatest public advantage in having those duties united would be\r\n  the collection of the whole of the rates in one sum by the same\r\n  individual, and payment afterwards to the several purposes.\r\n\r\n  What are the present disadvantages of a separate collection of these\r\n  rates?—First, that there are three collectors to pay instead of one.\r\n  1_s._ in the pound is paid to the collector of the highway rates,\r\n  which is supposed to produce 100_l._ per annum. The collector of the\r\n  poor’s rates is paid by a fixed salary of 150_l._ per annum. The\r\n  collector of the commissioners’ rates is paid 8_d._ in the pound, and\r\n  he gets upwards of 100_l._ per annum. If the collection of the rates\r\n  were consolidated, they might be collected for 200_l._ per annum, and\r\n  upwards of 150_l._ per annum might be saved in salaries alone; but a\r\n  much larger sum might be saved by a more efficient collection of the\r\n  smaller rates. The surveyor’s rates and the commissioners’ rates not\r\n  being sufficient to occupy the whole time of separate individuals,\r\n  they attend to other things, and consequently much money is lost by\r\n  the delay in the operation. Parties remove, or die, or leave the town.\r\n  Three times the amount has been lost in Wolverhampton on the\r\n  collection of the highway rate as compared with the poor’s rates. The\r\n  highway rate and the commissioners’ rates, each being made for twelve\r\n  months, the collectors usually collect from the large rate payers\r\n  first; considerable time elapses before the smaller payers are called\r\n  upon, consequently much is lost by the delay. I have known it that the\r\n  highway rate has not been demanded in some parts of the town for seven\r\n  or eight months after it has been granted. The surveyors of highways,\r\n  and the commissioners of improvements, not taking so much care in\r\n  obtaining securities for the smaller rates, run greater risks of\r\n  defalcation. I do not advert to the collectors of the smaller rates in\r\n  our town, but the collectors of the smaller rates, being tradesmen,\r\n  usually use the public money in their trades, and there is frequently\r\n  much peculation. The accounts of the collection and expenditure of the\r\n  smaller rates are generally badly kept.\r\n\r\nWhat I have already submitted will, I hope, suffice to sustain the\r\nrecommendation, that at the least nothing should be done to aggravate\r\nthe existing state of complication and waste, by new divisions of\r\nservice and the unnecessary additions of new and unqualified officers,\r\nand that everything should be done to guard against the continued\r\nreproduction of the evils in question in districts where there is clear\r\nground. It would, I apprehend, be practicable in the old districts to\r\nsuperadd the appointments of officers, with proper qualifications,\r\nwithout any diminution of the emoluments of the existing paid officers\r\nor any material disturbance of them.\r\n\r\nWhen the great importance of the general land drainage to the health of\r\nthose who labour upon it and to their most productive employment is\r\nfully considered, it will, I conceive, be found entitled to all\r\ncollateral aid, to which an additional title would be conferred by equal\r\ncontribution of the owners and occupiers to the expenses of public\r\ndrainage. If officers of proper qualifications and responsibilities were\r\nappointed, the works for sewerage branching from the towns, and the road\r\ndrainage, could not fail to aid, as indeed I conceive it should be\r\ndirected to aid, the private land drainage. The same surface levels and\r\nsewerage, if made on the scale proposed by the Poor Law and Tithe\r\nCommissioners (namely, of three chains to an inch) would serve for all\r\ncivil purposes, whether of towns or general land drainage, or road\r\ndrainage, for determining the descent of streams, for the application of\r\nthe water of which it is desirable to rid the upland wastes, and would\r\nfrequently be most beneficially applied for the use of the towns, and\r\nfor the use of the poorer districts.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of persons having the scientific qualifications and\r\nposition of civil engineers might serve to supply a want which is\r\ngenerally found to be the chief impediment to the drainage of land\r\nsubdivided amongst numerous small holders, namely, the means of\r\nreference or appeal to some authority deriving confidence from skill and\r\nimpartiality to determine on the need of works, and the mode of\r\nexecuting them, or to arbitrate; and on the compensation due from damage\r\narising from them. Given such an authority, and in those small, but,\r\nfrom their great number, most important cases, where the expense of an\r\napplication to Parliament is out of the question, it might, be safe to\r\nsay, by a general provision, that the inhabitants of a town may procure\r\nsprings of water, and make, deepen, and scour drains through the\r\ncircumjacent district; that regulations may be made for arching over or\r\ncovering the sewers to proper distances from the towns; for the purchase\r\nof ground, and for the erection of works for rendering the refuse of the\r\ntowns available for agricultural purposes: power might also be given to\r\nlay pipes in the highways, to put plugs for the supplies of water\r\nagainst fires, and for watering the roads.\r\n\r\nOn referring to the experience of the efforts made in Ireland for the\r\ndrainage and reclaiming of bog lands, by which large tracts would be\r\nobtained, it appears that the working of legislative measures for those\r\npurposes have extensively failed, because the landowners had not\r\nsufficient security that the work would be properly planned and\r\nexecuted.[46]\r\n\r\nI would here beg leave to guard myself from an apparent inconsistency.\r\nIn 1838, I was examined before a committee of the House of Commons on\r\ntheir resolution, “That it is expedient that the parishes, townships,\r\nand extra-parochial places should be united in districts for the repair\r\nof the highways throughout England and Wales.” On that occasion I\r\nadverted to the evil of the unnecessary multiplication of new\r\nestablishments as well as new officers, to their inevitable inefficiency\r\nand to the expense and obstruction to improvement which they created;\r\nand I submitted these, amongst other grounds, for proposing that the new\r\nduties should devolve on the boards of guardians of the new unions, as\r\nsuch duties had been in various instances combined under local Acts. The\r\ncommittee recommended the proposal for adoption. On the premises then\r\nplaced before me, as to the expediency of establishing a new\r\nadministrative body with new clerks and officers for the collection and\r\nmanagement of the fund for repairs of the highways _alone_, and in small\r\ndistricts for which even the areas of unions were thought large, I\r\nshould still adhere to the same conclusion.[47]\r\n\r\nThe present inquiry, however, has shown the general primary importance\r\nof the works of sewerage and drainage throughout the country. The\r\nexecution of those works would properly devolve upon the commissioners\r\nof sewers already in existence in the towns, or in the marsh districts,\r\nor upon commissions of sewers which it will be found necessary to issue\r\nto places where there has been no need of surface drainage, but which\r\nstand in need of under-drainage. These being the primary works for\r\nmaking the ground clear and keeping it clear for all other works, would\r\nnecessarily require the highest science and skill, and the strongest\r\nestablishment; and it would be only carrying farther the principle of\r\nconsolidation, as the only means of obtaining the most efficient\r\nservice, the most conveniently and at the lowest cost, now to recommend\r\nthat the care of the roads should, of all structural works, be made to\r\ndevolve upon that body which has the best means of executing them,\r\nnamely, the commissions of sewers, revised as to jurisdiction, and\r\namended and strengthened as to power and responsibility. What Colonel J.\r\nF. Burgoyne, the experienced chairman of the Board of Works in Ireland,\r\nstated in his evidence before the committee of the House Commons in\r\n1836, (question 35,) on the consolidation of the turnpike trusts, may be\r\napplied to the consolidation of other local works:—“One office and\r\naccount will then do for the whole; a superior superintendent could then\r\nbe employed, and more perfect machinery; the means will be more\r\ngenerally available, and can be concentrated where required, by which\r\nthe works will be carried on with more advantage, and a system of\r\nregular and rigid maintenance can be established so much more economical\r\nand beneficial than that of occasional and periodical repairs.”\r\n\r\nIt is due to state that in petitions from ratepayers much\r\ndissatisfaction is expressed with the proceedings of the commissions of\r\nsewers, and their objectionable working is assigned to their\r\nirresponsibility, and a favourite remedy proposed is to make them\r\nelective; but if the administration of expenditure by elective vestries\r\nbe examined, it is found to be no better; and of entirely open vestries,\r\neven worse; and the practical responsibility for injustice done to\r\nindividuals, or to any one who cannot get up a party, still less. It\r\nmay, however, be submitted for consideration, whether the commissions\r\nfor sewers might not be so far modified as to admit some infusion of the\r\nrepresentative principle in their composition, by including, as\r\nex-officio members of the commission, the chairman and vice-chairmen for\r\nthe time being of the Boards of Guardians of the poor law unions\r\nincluded within the jurisdiction of the commission. These officers are\r\nelected by the elected representatives of the ratepayers—the guardians.\r\nIt will be seen that much of the evil which the preventive measures\r\nwithin the province of the commission of sewers must provide against, is\r\npresented, in the first instance, to the Board of Guardians, in the\r\nshape of claims to relief on the ground of destitution occasioned by\r\nsickness. The chairman or the vice-chairman, before whom the cases are\r\nthus brought, would form an efficient medium of communication. The\r\nmeasures of drainage and structural improvement are permanent\r\nimprovements of the greatest importance to the labouring men, in common\r\nwith other classes; but it is matter of fact that such improvements are\r\nthe least supported by those who have the least permanent interest—the\r\nsmaller occupiers; or by those who have the least means and have the\r\ngreatest dread of immediate expenses—the smaller owners. The chairmen\r\nand the vice-chairmen of the unions in the rural districts are, however,\r\nthe chief landed proprietors, who are elected by the guardians for the\r\ninterest they take in the improvement of local administration. The most\r\nimportant improvements in the residences of the labouring classes that\r\nhave been brought to view by this inquiry have arisen from the\r\nspontaneous benevolence of the larger proprietors; and so much\r\nimprovement must depend upon their voluntary exertion, that, for the\r\nsake of the labouring classes, it recommends itself as an important\r\narrangement, that those who, as chairmen of the Boards, have the\r\ndistribution of relief to the destitution attendant on sickness, should\r\nbe placed in a position to represent the need of the means of\r\nprevention, and urge forward their execution.\r\n\r\nWhen the extent of the removable causes of sickness and mortality are\r\nmore clearly and extensively understood, as they will be, the Board of\r\nGuardians will of necessity occupy much of the position of the Leet, as\r\na body fitted to act on complaints made, and to reclaim the execution of\r\nthe law against omissions and infractions which occasion illness or\r\ninjury to the most helpless classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Boards of Health, or Public Officers for the Prevention of Disease._\r\n\r\nIn reports and communications, the institution of district Boards of\r\nHealth is frequently recommended, but in general terms, and they nowhere\r\nspecify what shall be their powers, how they shall seek out information\r\nor receive it, and how act upon it. The recommendation is also\r\nsanctioned by the committee which sat to inquire into the health of\r\nlarge towns; and the committee state that “the principal duty and object\r\nof these boards of health would be precautionary and preventive, to turn\r\nthe public attention to the causes of illness, and to suggest means by\r\nwhich the sources of contagion might be removed.” “Such boards would\r\nprobably have a clerk, paid for his services, whose duty it would be to\r\nmake minutes of the proceedings, and give such returns in a short\r\ntabular form as might be useful for reference, and important, as\r\naffording easy information on a subject of such vital interest to the\r\npeople.”\r\n\r\nI would submit that it is shown by the evidence collected in the present\r\ninquiry, that the great preventives—drainage, street and house cleansing\r\nby means of supplies of water and improved sewerage, and especially the\r\nintroduction of cheaper and more efficient modes of removing all noxious\r\nrefuse from the towns—are operations for which aid must be sought from\r\nthe science of the civil engineer, not from the physician, who has done\r\nhis work when he has pointed out the disease that results from the\r\nneglect of proper administrative measures, and has alleviated the\r\nsufferings of the victims. After the cholera had passed, several of the\r\nlocal boards of health that were appointed on its appearance continued\r\ntheir meetings and made representations; but the alarm had passed, and\r\nalthough the evils represented were often much greater than the cholera,\r\nthe representations produced no effect, and the boards broke up. In\r\nParis a Board of Health has been in operation during several years, but\r\nif their operations, as displayed in their reports, be considered, it\r\nwill be evident that, although they have examined many important\r\nquestions and have made representations, recommending for practical\r\napplication some of the principles developed in the course of the\r\npresent inquiry; still as they had no executive power, their\r\nrepresentations have produced no effect, and the labouring population of\r\nParis is shown to be, with all the advantages of climate, in a sanitary\r\ncondition even worse than the labouring population of London. In the\r\nAppendix I have submitted a translation of a report descriptive of the\r\nlabours of the Conseil de Salubrité, in Paris. From this report it will\r\nbe seen that they have few or no initiative functions, and that they are\r\nchiefly called into action by references made to them by the public\r\nauthorities to examine and give their opinion on medical questions that\r\nmay arise in the course of public administration as to what\r\nmanufacturing or other operations are or are not injurious to the public\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nThe action of a board of health upon such evils as those in question\r\nmust depend upon the arrangements for bringing under its notice the\r\nevils to be remedied. A body of gentlemen sitting in a room will soon\r\nfind themselves with few means of action if there be no agency to bring\r\nthe subject matters before them; and an inquiring agency to seek out the\r\nevils from house to house, wherever those evils may be found, to follow\r\non the footsteps of the private practitioner would be apparently\r\nattended with much practical difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe statements of the condition of considerable proportions of the\r\nlabouring population of the towns into which the present inquiries have\r\nbeen carried have been received with surprise by persons of the\r\nwealthier classes living in the immediate vicinity, to whom the facts\r\nwere as strange as if they related to foreigners or the natives of an\r\nunknown country. When Dr. Arnott with myself and others were examining\r\nthe abodes of the poorest classes in Glasgow and Edinburgh, we were\r\nregarded with astonishment; and it was frequently declared by the\r\ninmates, that they had never for many years witnessed the approach or\r\nthe presence of persons of that condition near them. We have found that\r\nthe inhabitants of the front houses in many of the main streets of those\r\ntowns and of the metropolis, have never entered the adjoining courts, or\r\nseen the interior of any of the tenements, situate at the backs of their\r\nown houses, in which their own workpeople or dependents reside.\r\n\r\nThe duty of visiting loathsome abodes, amidst close atmospheres\r\ncompounded of smoke and offensive odours, and everything to revolt the\r\nsenses, is a duty which can only be expected to be regularly performed\r\nunder much stronger motives than can commonly be imposed on honorary\r\nofficers, and cannot be depended upon even from paid officers where they\r\nare not subjected to strong checks. The examination of loathsome prisons\r\nhas gained one individual a national and European celebrity. Yet we have\r\nseen that there are whole streets of houses, composing some of the wynds\r\nof Glasgow and Edinburgh, and great numbers of the courts in London, and\r\nthe older towns in England, in which the condition of every inhabited\r\nroom, and the physical condition of the inmates, is even more horrible\r\nthan the worst of the dungeons that Howard ever visited. In Ireland\r\nprovisions for the appointment of Boards of Health have been made, but\r\nthey appear to have failed entirely. One of the medical practitioners\r\nexamined before the Committee of the House of Commons was asked, in\r\nrespect to the operation of these provisions:—\r\n\r\n  “3297. But in ordinary times, when the fever is not of very great\r\n  intensity, and is confined to the dwellings of the humbler classes,\r\n  there is no such provision put into force?—No, but then there is\r\n  another provision which may be put into force; this Act provides, that\r\n  ‘whenever in any city, town, or district, any fever or contagious\r\n  distemper shall prevail, or be known to exist, it shall and may be\r\n  lawful for any one or more magistrates, upon the requisition of five\r\n  respectable householders, to convene a meeting of the magistrates and\r\n  householders of such city, town, or district, and of the medical\r\n  practitioners within the same, in order to examine into the\r\n  circumstances attending such fever or contagious distemper.’ There is\r\n  another Act of 59 Geo. III., c. 41, which enables the parishes to\r\n  appoint officers of health; that is, a permanent power. Those officers\r\n  have very considerable authority; they can assess a rate.\r\n\r\n  “3298. Are they appointed?—They are appointed, I think, in all the\r\n  parishes in Dublin except two; but they are inoperative: they are\r\n  unpaid, and it is a very disgusting duty. They can be made to serve,\r\n  but there is no control as to the amount of service they perform; so\r\n  that the provision is quite inoperative, unless an alarm exists.\r\n\r\n  “3299. Do you not think the appointment of some such officers,\r\n  properly appointed, properly paid, and having reasonable power, for\r\n  the purpose of suggesting and enforcing such measures as shall be\r\n  beneficial, would be highly valuable?—I am sure it would, and it would\r\n  save an amazing quantity of expenditure to the country.”\r\n\r\nIt has only been under the strong pressure of professional duties by the\r\nphysicians and paid medical and relieving officers responsible for\r\nvisiting the abodes of the persons reduced to destitution by disease\r\nthat the condition of those abodes in the metropolis have of late been\r\nknown; and I believe that it is only under continued pressure and strong\r\nresponsibilities and interests in prevention that investigation will be\r\ncarried into such places, and the extensive physical causes of disease\r\nbe effectually eradicated.\r\n\r\nWhilst experience gives little promise even of inquiries from such a\r\nbody as Boards of Health without responsibilities, still less of any\r\nimportant results from the mere representations of such bodies separated\r\nfrom executive authority, I would submit for consideration what appears\r\nto me a more advantageous application of medical science, viz., by\r\nuniting it with boards having executive authority.\r\n\r\nNow, the claim to relief on the ground of destitution created by\r\nsickness, which carries the medical officer of the union to the interior\r\nof the abode of the sufferer, appears to be the means of carrying\r\ninvestigation precisely to the place where the evil is the most rife,\r\nand where the public intervention is most called for. In the metropolis\r\nthe number of cases of fever alone on which the medical officers were\r\nrequired to visit the applicants for relief, at their own residences,\r\namounted during one year to nearly 14,000. The number of medical\r\nofficers attached to the new unions throughout the country, and engaged\r\nin visiting the claimants to relief on account of sickness, is at this\r\ntime about 2300.\r\n\r\nWere it practicable to attach as numerous a body of paid officers to any\r\nlocal Boards of Health that could be established, it would scarcely be\r\npracticable to insure as certain and well directed an examination of the\r\nresidences of the labouring classes as I conceive may be ensured from\r\nthe medical officers of the unions. In support of these anticipations of\r\nthe efficiency of the agency. of the medical officers when directed to\r\nthe formation of sanitary measures, I beg leave to refer to the\r\nexperience of a partial trial of them under a clause of the recent\r\nMetropolitan Police Act, by which it is provided, that if the guardians\r\nof the poor of an union or parish, or the churchwardens and overseers of\r\nthe poor of any parish within the Metropolitan Police district, together\r\nwith the medical officer of any such parish or union, shall be of\r\nopinion, and shall certify under the hands of two or more of such\r\nguardians, churchwardens, and overseers, and of such medical officer,\r\nthat any house, or part of any house, is in such a filthy unwholesome\r\ncondition that the health of the inmates is thereby endangered, then the\r\nmagistrates may, after due notice to the occupiers, cause the house to\r\nbe cleansed at his expense.\r\n\r\nThe defects of the provision are, that it only authorizes cleansing and\r\nnot providing for the means of cleansing and personal cleanliness, by\r\ndirecting supplies of water to be laid on; that it does not extend to\r\nthe alterations of the external condition of the dwelling; that the\r\nimmediate expense falls upon the occupier, who is usually in so abject a\r\nstate of destitution as to serve as a barrier to any proceeding\r\napparently tending to any penal infliction. With all these\r\ndisadvantages, its working may be submitted to show the general\r\neligibility of the medical officers of unions as officers for the\r\nexecution of sanitary measures. The following account is given by the\r\nclerk to the Board of Guardians of Bethnal Green of the working of the\r\nprovision in that part of the metropolis:—\r\n\r\n  _Mr. William Brutton._—We have taken prompt measures to execute the\r\n  clause of the Metropolitan Police Act, and the Commissioners’\r\n  recommendations upon it, in our parish, and the effect produced has\r\n  already been beneficial. For example, the medical officer recently\r\n  reported, through me, to the Board of Guardians, that fever had arisen\r\n  in certain small tenements in a court called Nicholl’s Court, and that\r\n  it was likely to spread amongst the poorer classes in the district. He\r\n  reported that others of the houses than those in which fever existed\r\n  (and the inmates) were in a filthy condition, and that, unless\r\n  measures were taken for cleansing them properly, fever must\r\n  necessarily ensue. The Board, on receiving this communication, desired\r\n  me to proceed instantly, and take such measures as appeared to me to\r\n  be necessary for the abatement and prevention of the evil. I\r\n  immediately obtained a summons from the magistrates for the attendance\r\n  of the owner of the houses. He came directly, and stated that he was\r\n  not aware that the premises were in the condition in which our medical\r\n  officer had found them; and he promised that measures should be taken\r\n  for proper cleansing. Those measures were taken: the furniture of the\r\n  houses was taken out and washed; the houses were lime-washed. Some of\r\n  those who were ill died, but the progress of the fever was certainly\r\n  arrested.\r\n\r\n  The Board followed up these proceedings by circulating the\r\n  Commissioners’ instruction and form of notification in every part of\r\n  the parish. But the proceeding had a very good effect in the immediate\r\n  neighbourhood. The proceeding was observed by the neighbours, and\r\n  there is every reason to believe that they have set to work to cleanse\r\n  and prevent a similar visitation. We have also learned that the\r\n  landlords of some of these smaller tenements have been rather more\r\n  particular than before: they have said we must see to the cleansing of\r\n  these places lest we should be had up for it before the magistrates.\r\n\r\n  The guardians, considering the form of notifications useful, have\r\n  directed that they should be issued periodically before the times when\r\n  disease usually appears. In the course of a fortnight or three weeks\r\n  hence, when the equinoctial gales prevail, and when we have usually\r\n  much sickness and claims to relief, we shall probably have another\r\n  issue of the notifications.\r\n\r\n  We have also given instructions to the relieving officer, as well as\r\n  the medical officer, to report on the existence of any filth or things\r\n  likely to be productive of disease that he may observe in the course\r\n  of his visits to the houses where he is called by the claims to\r\n  relief. The services of the relieving officer are highly important, as\r\n  he has an opportunity of observing the state of filth and the obvious\r\n  predisposition, and perhaps of causes of disease, preventing it before\r\n  the visits of the medical officer, who is of course only called upon\r\n  to attend when disease has arisen. The relieving officers visit more\r\n  frequently than the medical officer, and give the tickets or orders\r\n  requiring his attendance.\r\n\r\n  You are Commissioner of the Sewers in the Tower Hamlets, are you\r\n  not?—Yes, I am.\r\n\r\n  And you are of course aware of their procedure?—Yes.\r\n\r\n  Do you think that body would be available for the execution of\r\n  sanitary measures?—Certainly not as compared with the Board of\r\n  Guardians: the Commissioners of Sewers meet only monthly, and have no\r\n  medical officers and no relieving officers. The Board of Guardians\r\n  meets weekly, and their officers are constantly at work, night and\r\n  morning. We have not even waited for the landlords, where prompt\r\n  measures appeared to be necessary for the removal of any active cause\r\n  of disease. Where cesspools have overflowed, and where there has been\r\n  a stoppage of water, we have directed the surveyor of the roads to\r\n  ascertain the cause of the stoppage, and to remedy the mischief\r\n  forthwith.\r\n\r\n  But what legal right have the guardians had to do that: they have no\r\n  legal right to direct the road surveyor in the performance of his\r\n  duties?—Strictly speaking, we have not, but we have forcibly suggested\r\n  it as a matter of expediency.\r\n\r\n  Between the notification of the evil and the execution of the remedy,\r\n  in the example you have cited by the Board of Guardians, what length\r\n  of time elapsed?—From the Friday to the Monday following.\r\n\r\n  What time, so far as you have had experience, need ordinarily elapse\r\n  if execution follow immediately on the report?—Execution would follow\r\n  immediately on the order of the Board of Guardians. I think, however,\r\n  that the union officers should, in case of emergency, have a summary\r\n  acting power immediately for the preservation of life. The Guardians\r\n  thought their examination of the spot unnecessary after the report of\r\n  the medical officer.\r\n\r\nThe following is the examination of the clerk to the Strand union as to\r\nthe practical working of the same measure in another district:—\r\n\r\n_Mr. James Corder_, clerk to the Strand union, examined;—\r\n\r\n  What has been done in the Strand union in respect to the provisions of\r\n  the Metropolitan Police Act, 2 and 3 Vict., c. 71, sec. 41, with\r\n  respect to the powers conferred by that statute for the cleansing of\r\n  houses which are in an unwholesome condition?\r\n\r\n  The attention of the medical officers was immediately drawn to the\r\n  section of the Act, and the instructions of the Poor Law Commissioners\r\n  relating thereto; and the result has been that proceedings have been\r\n  had in several cases, in all of which the necessary cleansing has been\r\n  performed by the owners, without the guardians being driven to the\r\n  necessity of causing the requisite lime-whiting and cleansing to be\r\n  done. The medical officer had frequently complained of the condition\r\n  of the places into which the cleansing had been carried. Those places\r\n  had for years been in the filthiest and most unwholesome condition: in\r\n  some courts and alleys the pavements were covered with an accumulation\r\n  of the most offensive matter, including the carcases of dead animals,\r\n  such as dogs and cats, which the scavengers said formed no part of\r\n  their contract to remove: their contract was only to cleanse the\r\n  carriage ways. Some of these courts and alleys abound in the principal\r\n  thoroughfares in the metropolis. The public, in passing through a\r\n  thoroughfare like the Strand, would scarcely imagine that an evil of\r\n  so much magnitude was close at hand.\r\n\r\n  The powers conferred by the clause in question appears to be\r\n  restricted to the cleansing of the houses and the passages within the\r\n  cartilage. What proceedings did the guardians take with relation to\r\n  these external passages?\r\n\r\n  They directed the condition of the places to be represented to the\r\n  Commissioners for paving and cleansing the district, who caused the\r\n  filth complained of to be removed. The cleansing of the footways,\r\n  however, forms no part of the duty of the Commissioners of Pavement,\r\n  nor of their surveyor, nor of the scavenger appointed by them; and\r\n  what was done was done extra-officially.\r\n\r\n  It cannot, therefore, be relied upon for the future?\r\n\r\n  No; and it is to be observed that the Metropolitan Paving Act\r\n  evidently contemplates that the cleansing of the footways shall be\r\n  done by the inmates of the houses. In the poorer districts, however,\r\n  this is entirely omitted to be done; in addition to which these courts\r\n  and alleys are frequently made, on account of their obscurity, a\r\n  depository for most offensive matter. In the better neighbourhoods,\r\n  the service of cleansing is performed by the servants; but the poor\r\n  people, who rise before daylight, go to their work, and return at a\r\n  late hour, have no time to cleanse their courts, and their earnings\r\n  are too scanty to allow payment to others for the performance of the\r\n  duty. In the better neighbourhoods, the cleansing does not always take\r\n  place. The medical officers report, that there is a better average\r\n  health in the streets that are well cleansed than in others where the\r\n  people are otherwise in the same condition of life.\r\n\r\n  What are the main defects you have experienced in respect to the\r\n  provision of the Metropolitan Police Act, empowering the guardians to\r\n  take measures for cleansing houses?\r\n\r\n  First, the delay which must take place before the provisions of the\r\n  Act can be put in operation. The medical officer has first to make his\r\n  report to the Board of Guardians; several days elapse before the Board\r\n  meets: then guardians have to inspect the premises in conjunction with\r\n  the medical officer previously to certifying as to the state thereof:\r\n  then application is made to the magistrate, who issues his summons,\r\n  returnable in seven days; at the expiration of which, if the cleansing\r\n  be not performed, the guardians are empowered to cause it to be done;\r\n  but they must first obtain a magistrate’s warrant for the purpose. All\r\n  this engenders delay; in addition to which our guardians have, in the\r\n  first instance, caused the landlord to be written to with a view to\r\n  prevent further proceedings, which in some instances have been\r\n  successful; but when it is not successful, it creates a further delay,\r\n  during which disease may rapidly increase and spread. The second\r\n  defect of the provision is, that the owners are not liable for the\r\n  expenses incurred; and the occupiers are mostly of the poorest class,\r\n  who have no effects on which a distraint could be made. With all these\r\n  difficulties, however, this provision has been very beneficial in its\r\n  operation; and it is very much to be desired that larger facilities\r\n  should be afforded for carrying its intention more fully into effect.\r\n  It may be added, that the medical officer should have remuneration for\r\n  the trouble he entails upon himself, by a report, in attending before\r\n  magistrates, until the object is effected.\r\n\r\n_Mr. John Smith_, the clerk to the Whitechapel union:—\r\n\r\n  Have you taken any proceedings under the 41st clause of the\r\n  Metropolitan Police Act?\r\n\r\n  We have issued notifications to every house in the union of the\r\n  necessity of cleansing the houses by whitewashing them inside and out,\r\n  and that the owners and occupiers were amenable for any neglect. The\r\n  relieving officers report to me, that these notifications have already\r\n  been productive of very good effects, and that whitewashing has been\r\n  actively practised. The relieving officers were instructed, wherever\r\n  they found a case of neglect, to threaten the landlord that he would\r\n  be proceeded against unless the tenement was duly cleansed. But as yet\r\n  we have taken no legal proceedings, because we have advised with the\r\n  magistrates, who do not consider that the owners can be proceeded\r\n  against in the first instance, and the occupiers of the tenements,\r\n  which are liable to be proceeded against, are most of them paupers and\r\n  persons in extreme poverty.\r\n\r\n  With respect to the remedies, I find that the personal inconvenience\r\n  to which the clause subjects the guardians of visiting the spot is a\r\n  provision which will greatly obstruct its operations, and will at all\r\n  events greatly delay proceedings from time to time. The guardians who,\r\n  in our union, are men of business, consider that their time is fully\r\n  occupied at the Board, and they object to any attendance out of the\r\n  Board, and would give it reluctantly. If the cases are taken before\r\n  the magistrate, it appears desirable that the medical officer should\r\n  not be compelled to attend unless it were absolutely requisite, and\r\n  that the relieving officer should be allowed to prove the facts as to\r\n  the state of the dwellings recited in the medical officer’s\r\n  certificate, which could rarely be disputed. If the point were\r\n  disputed by the owner, then the medical officer or other witnesses\r\n  might be forthcoming.\r\n\r\n  What is the number of houses in the union?—About 8000.\r\n\r\n  How many cases on the average do your medical officers visit in the\r\n  year?—About 4000.\r\n\r\n  Those visits of course are sometimes to different rooms of the same\r\n  tenement?—No doubt of that, and very frequently to the inmates of the\r\n  same room.\r\n\r\n  Are the visits of the relieving officers to the dwellings of the\r\n  labouring classes more extensive than the visits of the medical\r\n  officers?—I should say more extensive.\r\n\r\n  Between the two, are any class of the poorer and otherwise neglected\r\n  residences that would probably escape visitation?—I should say that\r\n  they must visit every spot within the district.\r\n\r\n  Within such districts as that of Whitechapel, do you think the three\r\n  present medical officers and the relieving officers would suffice to\r\n  carry out sanitary measures actively and efficiently?—I think that for\r\n  efficiency additional strength would be required; perhaps one officer,\r\n  whose especial duty it should be to attend to the duties connected\r\n  with sanitary measures, supposing them carried out by the agency of\r\n  the existing establishments.\r\n\r\nFrom the consideration of such practical evidence, it will be seen that\r\nthe ordinary duties of the relieving officer in the first instance, and\r\nof the medical officer afterwards, ensure domiciliary inspection of\r\nlarge districts to an extent and with a degree of certainty that could\r\nscarcely be ensured or expected of any agents or members of a board of\r\nhealth unconnected with positive administrative duties. The inspection\r\nof these officers of the boards of guardians more than supplies the\r\nexternal inspection of inquests or of the leets; and it is submitted\r\nthat in their position these boards may most beneficially exercise the\r\nfunctions of the leet in reclaiming the execution of the law, as against\r\nacts of omission and of commission, by which the poorest of the\r\nlabouring classes are injured and the ratepayers burdened.\r\n\r\nIt may therefore be submitted as an eligible preliminary general\r\narrangement, that it shall be required of the medical officer as an\r\nextra duty, for the due performance of which he should be fairly\r\nremunerated, that on visiting any person at that person’s dwelling, on\r\nan order for medical relief, he shall, after having given such needful\r\nimmediate relief as the case may require, examine or cause to be\r\nexamined any such physical and removable causes as may have produced\r\ndisease or acted as a predisposing cause to it; that he shall make out a\r\nparticular statement of them, wherein he will specify any things that\r\nmay be and are urgently required to be immediately removed. This\r\nstatement should be given to the relieving officer, who should thereupon\r\ntake measures for the removal of the nuisance at the expense of the\r\nowner of the tenement, unless he, upon notice which shall be given to\r\nhim, forthwith proceed to direct their removal. Except in the way of\r\nappeal by the owner against the proceedings of either officer, or where\r\na higher expense than 5_l._, or a year’s rent of the tenement, were\r\ninvolved by the alterations directed by the medical officer, it appears\r\nto be recommended that no application to the Board of Guardians or the\r\nmagistrates should be required in the first instance, as it frequently\r\nhappens that the delay of a day in the adoption of measures may occasion\r\nthe loss of life and the wide spread of contagious disease; and an\r\napplication to the Board of Guardians or to the petty sessions would\r\nusually incur delay of a week or a fortnight. To repeat the words of\r\nBlackstone,—“The security of the lives and property may sometimes\r\nrequire so speedy a remedy, as not to allow time to call on the person\r\non whose property the mischief has arisen to remedy it.” When any\r\ntenement is in a condition to endanger life from disease, as it comes\r\nwithin the principle of the law, so it should be included within its\r\nprovisions, and should be placed in the same condition as a tenement\r\ncondemned as being ruinous and endangering life from falling.\r\n\r\nThe instances above given of the working of the provisions of the\r\nMetropolitan Police Act for the cleansing of filthy tenements are,\r\nhowever, instances of zealous proceedings taken by competent officers in\r\nunions, where the attention of the guardians was specially called to the\r\nsubject, and where there were no opposing interests. But several other\r\ninstances might be presented, where the execution of the law is as much\r\nneeded, but where it is already as dead as any of the older laws for the\r\npublic protection, and the reason assigned is, that the local officers\r\nwill not, for the sake of principle and without manifest compulsion,\r\nenter into conflicts by which their personal interests may be\r\nprejudiced. Medical officers, as private practitioners, are often\r\ndependent for their important private practice, and even for their\r\noffice, on persons whom its strict performance might subject to expense\r\nor place in the position of defendants. Under such circumstances it is\r\nnot unfrequent to hear the expression of a wash from these officers,\r\nthat some person unconnected with the district may be sent to examine\r\nthe afflicted place, and initiate the proper proceedings. The working of\r\nthe provisions of the Factory Act for the limitation of the hours of\r\nlabour of children has been much impeded by the difficulty of obtaining\r\ncorrect certificates of age and bodily strength from private medical\r\npractitioners. On this topic a large mass of evidence might be adduced,\r\nshowing the unreasonableness of expecting private practitioners to\r\ncompromise their own interests by conflicts for the public protection\r\nwith persons on whom they are dependant.\r\n\r\nCases of difficulty requiring superior medical experience and skill\r\noccur frequently amongst the paupers. For general supervision as well as\r\nfor the elucidation of particular questions, the Board have proved the\r\npracticability of obtaining for the public service the highest medical\r\nskill and science. They have availed themselves of more various\r\nacquirements than would be found in any standing _conseil de salubrité_.\r\nOn questions respecting fever they have availed themselves of the\r\nservices of the physician of the London Fever Hospital; on questions of\r\nvaccination they have consulted the Vaccine Board of London, and the\r\nauthorities on the same question in Scotland. On questions as to\r\nventilation they have availed themselves of the services of Dr. Arnott;\r\nand on the general questions affecting the sanitary condition of the\r\npopulation they have consulted that gentleman and Dr. Kay, and Dr.\r\nSouthwood Smith, and others who could be found to have given special\r\nattention to the subject. When serious epidemics have broken out in\r\nparticular unions the central Board has dispatched physicians to their\r\naid, or suggested to the guardians that they should have recourse to the\r\nservices of physicians in the neighbourhoods. The services of Dr.\r\nArnott, Dr. Kay, and Dr. Southwood Smith were thus directed in aid of\r\nthe medical officers of the eastern districts of the metropolis; and\r\ntheir reports first developed to the public and the legislature the\r\nevils which form the subject of the extended inquiry, and that might\r\notherwise have continued without chance of notice, or mitigation or\r\nremoval, to have depressed the condition of the labouring classes of the\r\npopulation. But the results of such occasional visits appear to prove\r\nthe necessity and economy of an increase of the permanent local medical\r\nservice, and to establish a case for the appointment of a superior\r\nmedical man for a wider district than an ordinary medical officer, for\r\nthe special aid and supervision of the established medical relief.\r\n\r\nIt will frequently be found that there is the like need of immediate\r\nlocal inspection of the medical treatment of the destitute that there is\r\nof a grade of inspecting surgeons for the military hospitals. It cannot\r\nbe otherwise than that amidst a numerous body of men there must be much\r\nerror and neglect in the treatment of the destitute, in the absence of\r\nimmediate securities against, neglect. The most able of the guardians\r\nwould confess that if they are not entirely incompetent to supervise\r\nmedical service, they are at the best but imperfectly qualified for such\r\na task, and the medical officers would act with more satisfaction to\r\nthemselves from the supervision of officers from whom they might derive\r\naid and confidence.\r\n\r\nBut besides the medical treatment of the inmates of the workhouses and\r\nprisons, there are other cases within most districts which need the\r\npreventive service of a superior medical officer for the protection of\r\nthe public health.\r\n\r\nFirst, in the cases where the poorer classes are assembled in such\r\nnumbers as to make the assemblages _quasi_ public, and afford facilities\r\nfor medical inspection, as in schools.\r\n\r\nSecondly, also in places of work and in workmen’s lodging-houses. The\r\noccasional visits of a district officer, for the prevention of disease\r\nwould lead to the maintenance of due ventilation, and to the protection\r\nof the workpeople on such points as are already specified as injurious\r\nto the health, and that arise simply from ignorance, and are not\r\nessential to the processes. An examination of such places, if only\r\nquarterly, would lead to the most beneficial results.\r\n\r\nSo far as I have observed the working of the Factory Act, it appears to\r\nme that the duties now performed by the sub-inspectors of factories\r\nmight be more advantageously performed by superior medical officers, of\r\nthe rank of army surgeons, who are independent of private practice.\r\n\r\nI am confirmed in this view by the following evidence of _Mr. Baker_,\r\nsurgeon of Leeds, the only factory inspector who has such\r\nqualifications:—\r\n\r\n  “Have you, as a surgeon, whilst visiting the factories as an\r\n  inspector, had occasion to exercise your professional\r\n  knowledge?—Frequently; during my service I have turned out great\r\n  numbers of children with scald-heads, which they were apt to propagate\r\n  amongst the rest of the children; some with phthisis, whose subsequent\r\n  death was more than probable; some with scrofulous ulcers; a great\r\n  many with extreme cases of ophthalmia; probably I may have removed a\r\n  thousand of these cases altogether. I rarely go to a mill where I do\r\n  not see a case of scald-head.\r\n\r\n  “Have you ever had occasion to interpose in respect to\r\n  ventilation?—Frequently in extreme cases of variable temperature, also\r\n  in cases of offensive privies, which I find attended by dysenteric\r\n  affections; and also where there has been offensive water from\r\n  neglected sewers. I have also endeavoured to enforce personal\r\n  cleanliness on the children through the instrumentality of overlookers\r\n  and parents. One practice amongst the children in all kinds of mills\r\n  is to wear handkerchiefs on the head, by which the neglect of personal\r\n  cleanliness was concealed. Under these handkerchiefs were most of the\r\n  cases of scald-head, in a state of filthiness not easily describable.\r\n  I have assured the operatives that by the Act I had the power to\r\n  direct measures for the protection of their health as well as labour;\r\n  and I have established in many places the rule that the children shall\r\n  come with the faces clean, and the hair combed, and without\r\n  handkerchiefs whilst at work.”\r\n\r\n  By such inspection of workpeople in the places of work do you conceive\r\n  it would be practicable to influence largely the sanitary condition of\r\n  the labouring population without inspection of the private\r\n  houses?—Yes; for the ill health which was occasioned by the state of\r\n  their houses or other places, would of course be visible on such\r\n  inspection. If they were removed from their places of employment on\r\n  the presentation of such appearances, the inattention which had\r\n  occasioned it would be removed too.\r\n\r\n  “What length of time do you find such inspection would require each\r\n  time, say in a mill of about 1000 persons, and how frequent should\r\n  such inspection be?—On the average about two hours; to a practised eye\r\n  the symptoms of indisposition are discernable almost in walking\r\n  through a room. Under some circumstances an inspection of once in\r\n  three months would suffice.\r\n\r\n  “Are there masters in your district who are aware of the interest they\r\n  have in the health of their workpeople?—Yes; there are many who pay\r\n  particular attention. I might mention two where a surgeon is specially\r\n  employed to take care of their workpeople. When persons are ill, they\r\n  are listless and sleepy, and negligent; there is also more waste made\r\n  in the processes of manufacture.”\r\n\r\nThe superior economy of preventive services by such inspection as that\r\nabove displayed will scarcely need elucidation.\r\n\r\nFrom a consideration of such opportunities of inspection it will be\r\nperceived that the enforcement of sanitary regulations on such\r\ninspection by superior and independent officers, qualified by previous\r\nexamination, as in the army, would be a wise economy. By such\r\narrangements efficient medical superintendence would be provided for the\r\nindependent labourer employed in crowded manufactures, as well as for\r\nthe soldier and the sailor, not to speak of the pauper or the criminal.\r\nOne such officer would be able so to inspect and keep under sanitary\r\nregulations the places of work, the schools and all the public\r\nestablishments of such a town as Leeds, which would bring under view\r\nperhaps the greater proportion of the lower classes of the population.\r\nThere would still remain, however, those of the labouring classes who do\r\nnot work or lodge in large numbers, or work in a quasi-public manner, to\r\nbring them within the means of convenient inspection. There would also\r\nremain without protection the cases of persons of the middle classes.\r\n\r\nTo meet these cases, I would suggest that the information brought to the\r\nsuperintendent registrar as to the cause of death, imperfect and hearsay\r\nas it yet is, may serve as the most accurate index to the direction of\r\nthe labours of a district officer appointed to investigate the means of\r\nprotecting the health of all classes. Having suggested the registration\r\nof the causes of death (under medical superintendence), a head of\r\ninformation not contained in the original draught of the Deaths’\r\nRegistration Bill, I would guard against an over-estimate of the\r\nimportance of that provision; but I feel confident it would be found,\r\nwhen properly enforced, one of the most important, means of guiding\r\npreventive services in an efficient direction. For example, wherever, on\r\nthe examination of these registries, deaths from fever or other\r\nepidemics were found to recur regularly, and in numbers closely\r\nclustered together, there will be found, on examination, to be some\r\ncommon and generally removable cause in active operation within the\r\nlocality. Amongst whatsoever class of persons engaged in the same\r\noccupation deaths from one disease occur in disproportionately high\r\nnumbers or at low ages, the cause of that disease will generally be\r\nfound to be removable, and not essential to the occupation itself. The\r\ncases of the tailors, miners, and dressmakers, and the removable\r\ncircumstances which are found to govern the prevalence of consumption\r\namongst them, I adduce, as examples of the importance of the practical\r\nsuggestions to be gained from correct and trustworthy registries of the\r\ncauses of death occurring in particular occupations as well as in\r\nparticular places. When a death from fever or consumption occurs in a\r\nsingle family, in the state of isolation in which much of the population\r\nlive in crowded neighbourhoods, they have rarely any means of knowing\r\nthat it is not a death arising from some cause peculiar to the\r\nindividual. Even medical practitioners who are not in very extensive\r\npractice may have only a few cases, and may be equally unable to see in\r\nthem, in connexion with others, the operation of an extensive cause or a\r\nserious epidemic. The registration of the causes of death, however,\r\npresents to view the extent, to which deaths, from the same disease, are\r\ncommon at the same age, at the same time, or at the same place, or in\r\nthe same occupation.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important services, therefore, of a superior medical\r\nofficer of a district would be to ensure the entries of the causes of\r\ndeath with the care proportioned to the important uses to be derived\r\nfrom them. The public should be taught to regard correct registration as\r\nbeing frequently of as much importance for the protection of the\r\nsurvivors as a post-mortem examination is often found to be.\r\n\r\nThe mortuary registries and the registration of the causes of death are\r\nnot only valuable as necessary initiatives to the investigation of\r\nparticular cases, but as checks for the performance of the duty. The\r\nsystem of registration in use at Geneva, combining the certificate and\r\nexplanation of the private practitioners and the district physician,\r\ncorresponds with a recommendation originally made for the organization\r\nof the mortuary registries in England, and the experience of that\r\ncountry might, perhaps, be advantageously consulted.\r\n\r\nIt would be found that the appointment of a superior medical officer\r\nindependent of private practice, to superintend these various duties,\r\nwould also be a measure of sound pecuniary economy.\r\n\r\nThe experience of the navy and the army and the prisons may be referred\r\nto for exemplifications of the economy in money, as well as in health\r\nand life, of such an arrangement. A portion only of the saving from an\r\nexpensive and oppressive collection of the local rates would abundantly\r\nsuffice to ensure for the public protection against common evils the\r\nscience of a district physician, as well as the science of a district\r\nengineer. Indeed, the money now spent in comparatively fragmentations\r\nand unsystematized local medical service for the public, would, if\r\ncombined as it might be without disturbance on the occurrence of\r\nvacancies, afford advantages at each step of the combination. We have in\r\nthe same towns public medical officers as inspectors of prisons, medical\r\nofficers for the inspection of lunatic asylums, medical officers of the\r\nnew unions, medical inspectors of recruits, medical service for the\r\ngranting certificates for children under the provisions of the Factory\r\nAct, medical service for the post-mortem examinations of bodies, the\r\nsubject of coroners’ inquests, which it appears from the mortuary\r\nregistries of violent deaths in England amount to between 11,000 and\r\n12,000 annually, for which a fee of a guinea each is given. These and\r\nother services are divided in such portions as only to afford\r\nremuneration in such sums as 40_l._, 50_l._, 60_l._, or 80_l._ each; and\r\nmany smaller and few larger amounts.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be yet required for placing the union medical officers on a\r\ncompletely satisfactory footing, the combination of the services of\r\nseveral parish doctors in the service of fewer union medical officers\r\nwill be found to be advances in a beneficial direction. The\r\nmultiplication or the maintenance of such fragmentitious professional\r\nservices is injurious to the public and the profession. It is injurious\r\nto the profession by multiplying poor, ill-paid, and ill-conditioned\r\nprofessional men.[48] Although each may be highly paid in comparison\r\nwith the service rendered, the portions of service do not suffice for\r\nthe maintenance of an officer without the aid of private practice; they\r\nonly suffice, therefore, to sustain needy competitors for practice in\r\nnarrow fields. Out of such competition the public derive no improvements\r\nin medical science, for science comes out of wide opportunities of\r\nknowledge and study, which are inconsistent with the study to make\r\ninterests and the hunt for business in poor neighbourhoods.\r\n\r\nA medical man who is restricted to the observation of only one\r\nestablishment may be said to be excluded from an efficient knowledge\r\neven of that one. Medical men so restricted are generally found to\r\npossess an accurate knowledge of the morbid appearances, or of the\r\neffects amongst the people of the one establishment, but they are\r\nfrequently found to be destitute of any knowledge of the pervading cause\r\nin which they are themselves enveloped, and have by familiarity lost the\r\nperception of it. Thus it was formerly in the navy that medical officers\r\non board ship, amidst the causes of disease, the filth, and bad\r\nventilation, and bad diet, were referring all the epidemic disease\r\nexperienced exclusively to contagion from some one of the crew who was\r\ndiscovered to have been in a prison. We have seen that local reports\r\npresent similar examples of similar conclusions from the observation of\r\nsingle establishments in towns, in which reports effects are attributed\r\nas essential to labour, of which effects that same labour is entirely\r\ndivested in establishments in the county, or under other circumstances\r\nwhich the practitioners have had no means of observing and estimating.\r\nThe various contradictory opinions on diet, and the older views on the\r\ninnocuousness of miasma, are commonly referable to the circumstances\r\nunder which the medical observers were placed; and examples abound in\r\nevery district of the errors incidental to narrow ranges of observation\r\nin cases perplexed by idiosyncracies, and by numerous and varying\r\nantecedents. It should be understood by the public that the value of\r\nhospital and dispensary practice consists in the range of observation\r\nthey give; and that the extent of observation or opportunities of\r\nmedical knowledge are influenced or governed by administrative\r\narrangements. In several of the medical schools of the metropolis,\r\nhowever, the opportunities of knowledge are dependent on the cases which\r\nmay chance to arise there. Fortunate administrative arrangements have,\r\nin Paris, greatly advanced medical knowledge, by bringing large classes\r\nof cases under single observation. The most important discoveries made\r\nwith respect to consumption, those made by M. Louis, were based on the\r\nresults of the post-mortem examinations of nearly 1300 cases by that one\r\npractitioner. Nearly all the important conclusions deduced from this\r\nextensive range of observations were at variance with his own previous\r\nopinions and the opinions that had prevailed for centuries. The later\r\nand better knowledge of the real nature of fever cases has been obtained\r\nby a similar range of observation gained from the cases in fever\r\nhospitals. Applications have been several times made to the\r\nCommissioners by medical men engaged in particular researches to aid\r\nthem in the removal of the impediments to extended inquiry, by\r\ncollecting the information to be derived—from the sick-wards of the\r\nworkhouses and the out-door medical relief lists.\r\n\r\nThe highest medical authorities would agree that, whatsoever\r\nadministrative arrangements sustain narrow districts, and narrow\r\npractice, sustain at a great public expense, barriers against the\r\nextension of knowledge by which the public would benefit, and that any\r\narrangements by which such districts or confined practice is newly\r\ncreated, will aggravate existing evils. An examination of the state of\r\nmedical practice divided amongst poor practitioners in the thinly\r\npopulated districts shows that, but for the examinations, imperfect\r\nthough they be, as arrangements which sustain skill and respectability,\r\na large part of the population would be in the hands of ignorant\r\nbone-setters.\r\n\r\nOn a full examination of the duties which are suggested for a district\r\nphysician, or officer of public health, that which will appear to be\r\nmost serious is not the extent of new duties suggested, but the extent\r\nof the neglect of duties existing. The wants, however, which it is a\r\nduty to represent and repeat, as the most immediate and pressing, for\r\nthe relief of the labouring population, are those of drainage,\r\ncleansing, and the exercise of the business of an engineer, connected\r\nwith commissions of sewers, to which the services of a board of health\r\nwould be auxiliary. The business of a district physician connects him\r\nmore immediately with the boards of guardians, which, as having the\r\ndistribution of medical relief, and the services of medical officers, I\r\nwould submit, maybe made, with additional aid, to do more than can be\r\ndone by any local boards of health of the description given, separated\r\nfrom any executive authority or self-acting means of bringing\r\ninformation before them.\r\n\r\nI have submitted the chief grounds on which it appears to me that\r\nwhatever additional force may be needed for the protection of the public\r\nhealth it would everywhere be obtained more economically with unity, and\r\nefficiency, and promptitude, by a single securely-qualified and\r\nwell-appointed responsible local officer than by any new establishment\r\napplied in the creation of new local boards. Including, as sanitary\r\nmeasures, those for drainage and cleansing, and supplies of water as\r\nwell as medical appliances, I would cite the remarks on provisions for\r\nthe protection of the public health, made by Dr. Wilson at the\r\nconclusion of a report on the sanitary condition of the labouring\r\npopulation of Kelso. After having noted some particular improvements\r\nwhich had taken place, as it were, by chance, and independently of any\r\nparticular aids of science directed to their furtherance, he remarks\r\nthat “it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that much more might\r\nstill be accomplished, could we be induced, to profit by a gradually\r\nextending knowledge, so as to found upon it a more wisely directed\r\npractice. When man shall be brought to acknowledge (as truth must\r\nfinally constrain him to acknowledge) that it is by his own hand,\r\nthrough his neglect of a few obvious rules, that the seeds of disease\r\nare most lavishly sown within his frame, and diffused over communities;\r\nwhen he shall have required of medical science to occupy itself rather\r\nwith the prevention of maladies than with their cure; when governments\r\nshall be induced to consider the preservation of a nation’s health an\r\nobject as important as the promotion of its commerce or the maintenance\r\nof its conquests, we may hope then to see the approach of those times\r\nwhen, after a life spent almost without sickness, we shall close the\r\nterm of an unharassed existence by a peaceful euthanasia.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      VIII.—COMMON LODGING-HOUSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA town may be highly advanced in its own internal administration, its\r\ngeneral drainage, and its arrangements for house and street-cleansing\r\nmay be perfect, and they may be in complete action, and yet if the\r\npolice of the common lodging-houses be neglected, it will be liable to\r\nthe continued importation, if not the generation, of epidemic disease by\r\nthe vagrant population who frequent them. I have reserved the evidence\r\nrespecting them in order to submit it for separate considerations,\r\nbecause they may apparently be better considered independently of the\r\nadministrative arrangements which affect the resident population of the\r\nlabouring classes.\r\n\r\nFrom almost every town from whence sanitary reports have been received\r\nthat have been the results of careful examinations, the common\r\nlodging-houses are pointed out as _foci_ of contagious disease within\r\nthe district. These houses are stages for the various orders of tramps\r\nand mendicants who traverse the country from one end to the other, and\r\nspread physical pestilence, as well as moral depravation. The evidence\r\neverywhere received distinguishes them prominently as the subjects of\r\nimmediate and decidedly strong legislative interference for the public\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from the Report of _Mr. E. W. Baines_, the medical\r\nofficer of the Barnet union, is submitted as an example of the\r\ninformation received respecting them from the rural unions:\r\n\r\n  “The lodging-houses for trampers are a prolific source of disease, and\r\n  productive of enormous expense to the parish in which they may be\r\n  situate; from one I have within this week sent into the union\r\n  workhouse six cases, namely, two of fever, three of itch and\r\n  destitution, and one of inflammatory dropsy. These unhappy beings are\r\n  boarded and bedded in an atmosphere of gin, brimstone, onions, and\r\n  disease, until their last penny be spent, and their clothes pledged to\r\n  the keeper of the house, when they are kicked out and left to the\r\n  mercy of the relieving officer.”\r\n\r\nThe committee of physicians and surgeons, who have made a sanitary\r\nreport on the condition of the labouring population in Birmingham, give\r\nthe following account of the lodging-houses in that town:—\r\n\r\n  “Lodging-houses for the lowest class of persons abound in Birmingham.\r\n  They principally exist near the centre of the town, many of them in\r\n  courts; but great numbers of front houses, in some of the old streets,\r\n  are entirely occupied as lodging-houses. They are generally in a very\r\n  filthy condition; and, being the resort of the most abandoned\r\n  characters, they are sources of extreme misery and vice. These houses\r\n  may be divided into three kinds,—mendicants’ lodging-house,\r\n  lodging-houses where Irish resort, and houses in which prostitutes\r\n  live, or which they frequent.\r\n\r\n  “We find it stated in Mr. Burgess’s return, that in 47 of these the\r\n  sexes indiscriminately sleep together. In the day time the doors of\r\n  these houses are generally thronged with dirty, half-dressed women and\r\n  children; and if visited in an evening, the inmates are found to be\r\n  eating, drinking, and smoking. Such houses are, for the most part,\r\n  occupied by beggars and trampers, but many of them are the resort of\r\n  thieves. Some idea may be formed of the description of persons who\r\n  frequent some of these abodes, by stating that in two of them, one of\r\n  which was situate in John-street and the other in Thomas-street, a\r\n  chain, fastened at one end by a staple and at the other secured by a\r\n  padlock, was placed on the outside of the door, at the foot of the\r\n  staircase which led to the sleeping apartments. Upon asking the\r\n  mistress of the house for what purpose that was required, she stated\r\n  that she employed it to lock in the lodgers until she released them in\r\n  the morning, as they would otherwise decamp, and take away whatever\r\n  furniture or moveables they could carry with them. Some of these\r\n  houses are occupied exclusively by foreigners. In a court in\r\n  Park-street we visited one which was inhabited by Italians, men and\r\n  women, with their stock of musical instruments, monkeys, and other\r\n  small animals. We are informed that there is another Italian\r\n  lodging-house in Lichfield-street, as well as one which is frequented\r\n  only by the Flemish or German broom-girls.”\r\n\r\nIn whatever part of the kingdom these receptacles are examined they\r\nexhibit common characteristics. _Dr. Jenks_, in his report on the\r\nsanitary condition of the labouring classes in Brighton, gives the\r\nfollowing account of the lodging-houses:—\r\n\r\n  “Nottingham-street is the well-known haunt of tramps and beggars;\r\n  Egremont-street of the lowest prostitutes and thieves. Both streets\r\n  are on elevated ground, with good surface drainage, sufficiently wide\r\n  and commodious, and might easily be preserved in a decent state; but\r\n  all manner of disgusting refuse is thrown out of doors, and but seldom\r\n  removed by the scavengers. In Nottingham-street there are eight or\r\n  nine lodging-houses. Lodging-keepers have commonly three or four\r\n  houses, for each of which they pay 2_s._ 6_d._ per week. The following\r\n  is a description of one of them, and may serve as an _instar\r\n  omnium_:—The keeper of the lodging-house rented four of these small\r\n  tenements. One room, common to the whole of the inmates, who amounted\r\n  to 30, including the children, served both as kitchen and\r\n  sitting-room. This room was crowded when I visited it in company with\r\n  the chief police-officer, Mr. Solomons, with not less than 17 people\r\n  covered with filth and rags. In the largest of the sleeping-rooms, 16\r\n  feet by 10 feet, by 7 feet high, there were six beds, five on\r\n  bedsteads and one on the floor, to accommodate twelve people of both\r\n  sexes, besides children. Each person paid 3_d._ per night. Those who\r\n  could afford more could be accommodated with a small room with one\r\n  bed. * * * In a word, the streets in this neighbourhood have for many\r\n  years been an intolerable nuisance to the town at large. They are the\r\n  resort of tramps, begging impostors, thieves, and prostitutes of the\r\n  lowest description, who daily and nightly take their rounds through\r\n  the town.”\r\n\r\nThe following account of the lodging-houses in Manchester is from the\r\nreport of _Dr. Baron Howard_:—\r\n\r\n  “The pernicious effects resulting from the vitiation of the atmosphere\r\n  by the congregation of many persons in a confined space are lamentably\r\n  illustrated in the common _lodging-houses_ of the poor; the crowded,\r\n  dirty, and ill-ventilated state of which is, I conceive, without doubt\r\n  one of the most prolific sources of fever in Manchester. To those who\r\n  have not visited them, no description can convey anything like an\r\n  accurate idea of the abominable state of these dens of filth, disease,\r\n  and wretchedness.\r\n\r\n  “The great prevalence of fever in these houses during the severe\r\n  epidemic of 1837–38 attracted the especial notice of the Board of the\r\n  House of Recovery, who passed and transmitted the following resolution\r\n  to the churchwardens on the 3d of January, 1838:—‘It appearing that a\r\n  great number of cases of fever originates in the common lodging-houses\r\n  of the poor of the town, the Board begs to suggest to the\r\n  churchwardens and sidesmen the desirableness of appointing proper\r\n  persons to inspect the same, in order to prevent, as far as possible,\r\n  by cleanliness and ventilation, the increase and spread of this\r\n  malady.’ In consequence of this suggestion the parochial authorities\r\n  did immediately cause some of the most filthy of these establishments\r\n  to be cleansed and whitewashed; but it is evident that temporary\r\n  exertions of this kind, however praiseworthy, are quite inadequate to\r\n  effect much permanent improvement.\r\n\r\n  “In some of these houses as many as six or eight beds are contained in\r\n  a single room; in others, where the rooms are smaller, the number is\r\n  necessarily less; but it seems to be the invariable practice in these\r\n  ‘keepers of fever beds,’ as the proprietors were styled by Dr.\r\n  Ferriar, to cram as many beds into each room as it can possibly be\r\n  made to hold; and they are often placed so close to each other that\r\n  there is scarcely room to pass between them. The scene which these\r\n  places present at night is one of the most lamentable description; the\r\n  crowded state of the beds, filled promiscuously with men, women, and\r\n  children; the floor covered over with the filthy and ragged clothes\r\n  they have just put off, and with their various bundles and packages,\r\n  containing all the property they possess, mark the depraved and\r\n  blunted state of their feelings, and the moral and social disorder\r\n  which exists. The suffocating stench and heat of the atmosphere are\r\n  almost intolerable to a person coming from the open air, and plainly\r\n  indicate its insalubrity. Even if the place be inspected during the\r\n  day, the state of things is not much better. Several persons will very\r\n  commonly be found in bed; one is probably sick, a second is perhaps\r\n  sleeping away the effects of the previous night’s debauch, while\r\n  another is possibly dozing away his time because he has no employment,\r\n  or is taking his rest now because he obtains his living by some night\r\n  work. In consequence of this occupation of the room during the day,\r\n  the windows are kept constantly closed, ventilation is entirely\r\n  neglected, and the vitiated atmosphere is ever ready to communicate\r\n  its poisonous influence to the first fresh comer whom habit has not\r\n  yet rendered insensible to its effects, an exemption which seems to be\r\n  in some degree acquired by habitual exposure, and which accounts for\r\n  the immunity frequently enjoyed by the keepers themselves of these\r\n  houses, whilst their lodgers are attacked in succession. This\r\n  circumstance, which was particularly noticed by Dr. Ferriar, I have\r\n  often observed. Where cellars are occupied as lodging-houses, the back\r\n  room is generally used as the sleeping apartment; and as this has\r\n  often no window, and can only receive air and light through the door\r\n  opening into the front room, the utter impossibility of ventilation\r\n  renders the ravages of infectious fevers particularly destructive when\r\n  they once find entrance.\r\n\r\n  “The beds and bedding, being seldom washed or changed, are generally\r\n  in the most filthy condition, and consisting usually of those porous\r\n  materials to which contagious vapours are especially liable to attach\r\n  themselves, the danger of sleeping in them may be well conceived. Even\r\n  if a bed has been occupied by a fever patient who has died, or been\r\n  removed, it is often immediately used by fresh lodgers, without having\r\n  undergone any purification.\r\n\r\n  “The disgraceful state of these lodging-houses has been dwelt upon at\r\n  some length, because I consider their evils of a most serious and\r\n  extensive nature, and I feel quite satisfied they are the most\r\n  malignant _foci_ of infectious fevers in Manchester. Indeed it is my\r\n  decided opinion that the vitiation of the atmosphere by the living is\r\n  much more injurious to the constitution than its impregnation with the\r\n  effluvia from dead organic matter; and certainly all I have observed\r\n  in Manchester induces me to consider the ‘human miasms’ generated in\r\n  overcrowded and ill-ventilated rooms as a far more frequent and\r\n  efficient cause of fever than the malaria arising from collections of\r\n  refuse and want of drainage. I have been led to this conclusion from\r\n  having remarked that fever has generally prevailed more extensively in\r\n  those houses where the greatest numbers were crowded together, and\r\n  where ventilation was most deficient, although the streets in which\r\n  they are situated maybe well paved, drained, and tolerably free from\r\n  filth, than in those where there was less crowding, notwithstanding\r\n  their location in the midst of nuisances giving rise to malaria. This\r\n  inference is also supported by the fact of the higher relative\r\n  proportion of fever to other diseases which has been shown to exist in\r\n  the collegiate church district, where the number of crowded\r\n  lodging-houses and confined courts, the closely compacted state of the\r\n  buildings, the narrowness of the streets, and consequent density of\r\n  the population and absence of ventilations, are most remarkable.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. John Rayner_, medical officer of the Stockport union, gives the\r\nfollowing account of the lodging-houses in that town:—\r\n\r\n  “The lodging-houses in these districts, which are principally occupied\r\n  by the Irish labourers, are for the most part very much crowded, and\r\n  are in a remarkably filthy states. The beds and bedding are not only\r\n  loathsome to the sight but are extremely offensive to the smell, and\r\n  are so closely packed that several families may occupy the same room,\r\n  each bed containing several persons. In such places the married and\r\n  single often repose together, and the beds are so arranged, that in\r\n  some instances there is not room for a person to walk between them. I\r\n  have seen seven persons in the same bed, and last week removed to the\r\n  infirmary a case of rheumatic fever, with translation of the disease\r\n  to the heart, from a bed which every night contains _eight_ persons. I\r\n  have generally found that the lower order of Irish labourers occupy\r\n  the most filthy districts, and that wherever they _colonize_, misery\r\n  and wretchedness is sure to abound. They are the most common\r\n  applicants for medical relief at our charity.”\r\n\r\n  “I lately had a case of inflammation of the absorbments of the legs,\r\n  from a trifling injury to the foot, in an Irish boy, who was living in\r\n  a dark, damp cellar, about four yards square, in which were two beds.\r\n  The height of the ceiling was not more than six feet, and yet _seven_\r\n  persons laid in it, together with a few rabbits. One of the beds had\r\n  to be removed from the wall on account of its extreme dampness, and so\r\n  dark was the dwelling at mid-day, that I had to make use of a candle\r\n  whilst inspecting him.”\r\n\r\nThe following is the description of the lodging-houses at the next\r\nstage, by the relieving officer of the Macclesfield union:—\r\n\r\n_Mr. James Bland_, medical officer of the Macclesfield union,—\r\n\r\n  “I beg to observe that the lodging-houses are a fruitful source of\r\n  fever. The persons renting these tenements showed greater resistance\r\n  than others in having their houses properly whitewashed at the time\r\n  the epidemic cholera appeared. The vagrants who visit these houses are\r\n  frequently attacked with fever: exposed during the day to the\r\n  inclemency of the seasons, with their imperfect covering, ragged\r\n  clothes, and naked feet, at night thrust into a room perhaps of 16 or\r\n  20 square yards, having perhaps five or six beds and three individuals\r\n  in a bed, married and single, male and female, to all appearance\r\n  indiscriminately lodged. When a case of illness occurs, the\r\n  lodging-house keeper is most importunate and clamorous in demanding\r\n  relief from the town; and when obtained, it is quite a question\r\n  whether it will really be applied to the wants of the sufferer. I have\r\n  never any confidence that the remedies given will be administered to\r\n  the patient.”\r\n\r\nThe further stages of the lodging-houses on the northern roads are thus\r\ndescribed in the reports:—\r\n\r\n_Mr. Nicholas Oliver_, the medical officer of Durham, thus describes the\r\nlodging-houses in that town:—\r\n\r\n  “One fruitful source of generating and propagating contagious diseases\r\n  is to be found in those common lodging-houses where vagrants and\r\n  mendicants, or any one whatever, whether healthy or diseased, are for\r\n  a trifling sum provided with lodgings. I have known 40 persons half\r\n  clothed, lodged in one of those wretched dwellings, three or four\r\n  lying in one bed upon straw, and only a single counterpane to cover\r\n  them, which is never changed. Excrementitious matter was allowed to\r\n  accumulate and be about the rooms in all directions, the stench being\r\n  most revolting. In the beginning of summer fever of a typhoid type\r\n  occurred in this house and affected a number of the inmates, but being\r\n  in the other district, they came under the care of the other medical\r\n  attendant.”\r\n\r\nThe medical officer of the Teesdale union gives the following\r\ndescription of the houses in that stage:—\r\n\r\n  “In this court there are eight common lodging-houses, and the number\r\n  of lodgers sometimes amounts to 100; at this time it is 50: eight or\r\n  ten sleeping in a room, upon the most unwholesome straw. The buildings\r\n  are in general good; but the wretched and filthy state of the houses\r\n  can scarcely be conceived. From this part many of our applications\r\n  arise. It is, indeed, a source of physical and moral disease.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Gilbert Ward_, the medical officer of the Tynemouth union,\r\ndescribes the lodging-houses there as sources of disease, of which one\r\nexample may suffice:—\r\n\r\n  “In a low, damp, dirty, ill-ventilated, miserable hovel, kept by the\r\n  most filthy people I ever beheld, containing four beds seldom changed,\r\n  and which I have witnessed filled with beggars of the lowest\r\n  description, there have been the following cases:—A son and daughter\r\n  died, another son and daughter had the disease, and the mother had two\r\n  attacks, all within a period of 18 months. This family, in consequence\r\n  of their filthy habits, was removed to the workhouse, but could not be\r\n  induced to remain; and they again returned to their old quarters, and\r\n  were afflicted as above described.\r\n\r\n  “The constable has several times visited these houses, to endeavour to\r\n  prevent the nuisance of so many congregating in them; but his efforts\r\n  have hitherto been ineffectual.”\r\n\r\n_Sir John Walsham_ thus exemplifies the descriptions he has received of\r\nthe lodging-houses in Newcastle:—\r\n\r\n  “There is a considerable number of lodging-houses in Newcastle, some\r\n  of the rooms of which are frequently occupied by from 15 to 20 persons\r\n  each. In these houses the most deplorable scenes of profligacy and\r\n  depravity are met with, both sexes being crowded together in a manner\r\n  injurious to both health and morals.\r\n\r\n  “A medical gentleman told me, in Stockton, this morning, that in the\r\n  common lodging-houses where travelling vagrants are frequently\r\n  attacked with fever, &c., and in many cases die, the beds are the very\r\n  next night occupied by fresh inmates, who of course are infected with\r\n  the same disorder.”\r\n\r\nAnd one of the relieving officers for the same town says:—\r\n\r\n  “I have frequently had occasion to complain to the magistrates against\r\n  the lodging-houses taking in so many lodgers; but the law in this\r\n  respect is so defective that they could render me no assistance. On a\r\n  Sunday last July, I went to see a man (a travelling musician) who was\r\n  very ill of the small-pox, and died a few days afterwards. The house\r\n  contained four small rooms, and was situated in a back yard, in a very\r\n  narrow, confined, dirty lane. There were 40 people in the house, and\r\n  they were not all in that lodged there. Four months ago I went into a\r\n  room in the same yard; the room was very dirty; it was 9 feet broad by\r\n  15 feet long, and contained four beds, in which slept two men, four\r\n  women, and thirteen children. I found in one of the beds two children\r\n  very ill of scarlet fever; in another, a child ill of the measles; in\r\n  another, a child that had died of the measles the day before; and in a\r\n  fourth, a woman and her infant, born two days before; and the only\r\n  space between the four beds was occupied by a tinker, hard at work.”\r\n\r\nThe lodging-houses in Scotland are similarly characterized. _Dr. Scott\r\nAlison_ states that,—\r\n\r\n  “There are many regular lodging-houses in Tranent, perhaps from 15 to\r\n  20, in which paupers, vagrants, and a few labouring people live. The\r\n  people reside there for a considerable time. I have known colliers in\r\n  employment to live in these houses. They are crowded at all hours, but\r\n  more especially at night. Men, women, and children live and sleep in\r\n  the same apartment. In one of them I have seen an apartment, about 18\r\n  feet long and 10 feet wide, which contained four beds made up\r\n  constantly; and when the house was ‘throng,’ another was added to the\r\n  number. The lodging-houses are the head-quarters for beggars. The\r\n  people go about during the day pursuing their avocations, and return\r\n  home at night to regale themselves with their earnings. These people\r\n  lie in bed till very late, and, if visited in the forenoon, may be\r\n  seen sitting beside the fire, roasting herrings or frying meat. They\r\n  live well amidst their wretchedness.”\r\n\r\nIn the report of _Mr. James Cameron_, surgeon of Tain, there occurs the\r\nfollowing description of the lodging-houses in that part of Scotland:—\r\n\r\n  “There are three lodging-houses in Tain, which are chiefly occupied by\r\n  beggars and hawkers. These places are kept in the filthiest condition\r\n  imaginable: I have been credibly informed that the bed-clothes used in\r\n  one of these houses have not been washed for the last five years!\r\n  Summer being the season when these people are generally abroad, these\r\n  low lodgings are then often crowded to excess. During the week-days\r\n  the beggars and hawkers perambulate the country, returning on Saturday\r\n  night. They frequently, especially when collected in large numbers,\r\n  drink to excess; and their conduct on such occasions is riotous and\r\n  disgusting in the extreme. The general charge for such lodgings is\r\n  2_d._ per head for the night, with an ample allowance of whisky to the\r\n  landlords by way of perquisite. These individuals are unfortunately\r\n  the means of introducing infectious diseases, such as fever,\r\n  small-pox, measles, &c.”\r\n\r\nIn Edinburgh and Glasgow, as the confluence of vagrants, and especially\r\nof Irish vagrants, becomes greater, such receptacles become more\r\nnumerous and crowded, and the evils attendant upon them more intense.\r\n\r\nThe injury done to the health of the public in general, and to the\r\nhealth of portions of the operative classes, by the generation or\r\npropagation of disease in such places, forms only one part of the evils\r\nwhich call for interference by preventive measures. These evils appear\r\nto require for their correction powers to be put in operation by the\r\nconcurrent exertions of the officers charged with sanitary measures, or\r\nthe prevention of disease; of the officers charged with the\r\nadministration of relief to destitution and the prevention of mendicity,\r\nand of the officers charged with the protection of the public peace and\r\nthe prevention of crime. Further, to complete the view of the chief\r\nevils arising from these receptacles, we may refer to the report and\r\nevidence for the state of them, collected by my colleagues and myself,\r\non the inquiry as to the state of crime, under the Constabulary Force\r\nCommission on the state of the lodging-houses in respect to crime:—\r\n\r\n  “§35. We found only few of the magisterial divisions from which we\r\n  obtained information that were not seriously afflicted by the\r\n  existence of such receptacles, and in any arrangements for the\r\n  prevention of crime within the rural districts the means of\r\n  suppressing or controlling the common lodging-house must have a\r\n  prominent place. The trampers’ lodging-house is distinct from the\r\n  beer-shop or the public-house, or any licensed place of public\r\n  accommodation: it is not only the place of resort of the mendicant,\r\n  but of the common thief; it is the ‘flash-house’ of the rural\r\n  district; it is the receiving-house for stolen goods; it is the most\r\n  extensively-established school for juvenile delinquency, and commonly\r\n  at the same time the most infamous brothel in the district.\r\n\r\nThe magistrates of the division of Warwick state—\r\n\r\n  “‘That in the borough of Warwick such houses are both numerous and a\r\n  very general receptacle of petty offenders. Here the common vagrants\r\n  and trading beggars assemble in great numbers at nightfall, or take up\r\n  their quarters for very many days, making the lodging-house the common\r\n  centre from whence they issue in the morning, traverse their several\r\n  beats, and return at night. It is not unfrequent for such vagrants to\r\n  make the immediate neighbourhood their regular walk even for some\r\n  weeks, changing their beats, which are carefully arranged among\r\n  themselves, and only quitting their quarters to avoid detection in\r\n  some petty pilfering, or because, from becoming too well known, they\r\n  can no longer successfully impose on the public in the quarter they\r\n  have so long frequented.’\r\n\r\n“The magistrates of the Chelmsford division state:—\r\n\r\n  “‘There are several lodging-houses in the town of Chelmsford where in\r\n  the course of the year it is supposed upwards of 2000 trampers or\r\n  vagrants resort. The greater number of these persons shelter\r\n  themselves from apprehension and punishment under the Vagrant Act, by\r\n  professing to be match-sellers. This is made a cloak for begging alms,\r\n  and the pretext for going from house to house, and pilfering, as\r\n  opportunity offers. The lodging-houses at Chelmsford are made the\r\n  centre of a kind of circuit which these people make almost\r\n  periodically.\r\n\r\n  “‘The system of lodging-houses for travellers, otherwise trampers,\r\n  requires to be altogether revised: at present they are in the practice\r\n  of lodging all the worst characters unquestioned, and are subject to\r\n  no other control than an occasional visit of inspection from the\r\n  parish officers, accompanied by the constables, whose power of\r\n  interference, if they have a legal right of entry, does not extend to\r\n  some of the most objectionable points connected with those houses, as\r\n  they can merely take into custody such persons as they find in\r\n  commission of some offence. The state in which those houses are found\r\n  on the occasion of such visit proves how much they require\r\n  interference. The houses are small, and yet as many as thirty\r\n  travellers, or even thirty-five, have been found in one house; fifteen\r\n  have been found sleeping in one room, three or four in one bed, men,\r\n  women, and children promiscuously. Beds have been found occupied in a\r\n  cellar. It is not necessary to urge the many opportunities of\r\n  preparing for crime which such a state of things presents, or the\r\n  actual evils arising from such a mode of harbouring crowds of low and\r\n  vicious persons.’”\r\n\r\nIn our First Report we observed, that—“The mischiefs of these migratory\r\nstreams of depredators and vagrants, and other bad characters, is not\r\nconfined to the crimes which they commit, though those must be extremely\r\nextensive to furnish such numerous hordes with the means of subsistence;\r\nthese characters, experienced in the crimes and vices of the criminal\r\nassociations of the larger towns from whence they sally forth, form such\r\nlarge proportions of the population of the gaols in the rural districts,\r\nas are stated in the return of prisoners in Knutsford gaol. The other\r\nportion of the inmates of the gaol, chiefly agricultural labourers,\r\nnatives of the country, confined for misdemeanours, may in such\r\nreceptacles be considered pupils in these normal schools of crime, to\r\nlearn and carry back to the rural villages the knowledge and the\r\nincitement to felonious practices.”\r\n\r\nIt appears that, on the several grounds of public expediency, for the\r\npreservation of the public health, and for the preservation of the\r\npublic peace, all common lodging-houses,—all places which are open for\r\nthe reception of strangers, travellers, and wayfarers by the night, and\r\nhouses laid out and provided for numbers of lodgers, should be subjected\r\nto regulations for the protection of the inmates as well as the public\r\nat large. This appears, indeed, to be consistent with the ancient police\r\nof the country. By narrowing the definition of the places for which\r\nlicences were rendered necessary to those where spirits or fermented\r\nliquors are sold to be drunk on the premises, (as if a revenue were the\r\nonly proper object of their government,) it appears that there has been\r\na mischievous dereliction of the ancient and sound policy of the law\r\nwhich subjects the “victualler” as well as the keeper of the hostel,\r\ninn, or lodging-house to responsibilities for the protection of the\r\ninmates, and the convenience of the inhabitants in the neighbourhood\r\nwhere such houses may be situate. The common lodging-house keeper is in\r\nfact an inferior victualler, but evading the licence and the\r\nresponsibilities of the victualler, by sending out for the fermented\r\nliquors which are consumed by the lodgers.\r\n\r\nIt appears, from various portions of evidence, that the occupation of a\r\nlodging-house keeper is a profitable one: instances are given from\r\nvarious parts of the country where the keepers of such houses have\r\naccumulated property; and whilst the keepers of public-houses, however\r\nsmall, or of beer-shops, are subjected to the necessity of taking out\r\nlicences, there is no apparent reason for the exemption of lodging-house\r\nkeepers from that charge by reason of poverty; neither should I consider\r\nthat it would be a disadvantage, but the contrary, if the proper\r\nregulation of such houses were effected at some increase of the price of\r\nthe lodgings. On examination of the description of persons accommodated\r\nin such houses, (whilst there is a public provision for those who are\r\nreally in a state of destitution, and means are provided for removing\r\nthem to their places of settlement when it is necessary,) I find no\r\nclass whose migration is entitled to any encouragement by any diminution\r\nof the charge of providing proper lodgings. Another topic of\r\nconsideration in connexion with houses of this class, is the tendency of\r\nthe degraded accommodation to degrade the classes of the population who\r\nhave recourse to it. I would therefore submit for consideration, whether\r\nall common lodging-houses should not be required by law to take out\r\nlicences in the same manner as public-houses; and that, as the condition\r\nof holding such licences, they be subjected to inspection by the medical\r\nofficers of the union (or the district medical officer), and bound to\r\nconform to such sanitary regulations in respect to cleanliness,\r\nventilation, and numbers proportioned to the space, as he may be\r\nauthorized to prescribe for the protection of the health of the inmates:\r\nand also that all such lodging-houses shall be subjected to the\r\nregulations of the magistrates, and shall be open to the visits and\r\ninspection of the police, for the enforcement of duly authorized\r\nregulations, without any search-warrant or other authority than that\r\nnecessary for their entrance into any house belonging to a licensed\r\nvictualler.\r\n\r\nIt may further be submitted for consideration that, by the beneficial\r\nprogress made in the habits of temperance in some districts, the disuse\r\nof spirituous or fermented liquors may enable the proprietors of houses\r\nof a higher order of resort than those in question to convert them into\r\ncoffee-houses or victualling-houses, and at the same time dispense with\r\nthe expense of the licence, and avoid also the responsibilities for the\r\nprotection of the public which the law has attached to licensed houses\r\nof resort for travellers.\r\n\r\nFrom the reports received from the more populous towns, it would appear\r\nthat there are few houses which are let for the accommodation of large\r\nnumbers of regular lodgers which might not be benefited by the\r\ninspection of a medical officer. I believe it would be more beneficial\r\nto the public to extend than to narrow the definition of the places\r\nwhich should be subjected to regulations as lodging-houses; and that a\r\ndiscretion as to the description of house which shall be included might\r\nbe safely confided to the magistrates who have local charge of the\r\npublic peace and the public economy of the towns.\r\n\r\nThe report received from _Mr. Charles R. Baird_, on the state of the law\r\napplicable to the sanitary regulation of Glasgow, and the condition of\r\nthe labouring classes, as affected by the incompleteness or absence of\r\nsuch regulations, affords evidence of the practical effect of measures\r\nsuch as those recommended. Powers for the execution of such measures\r\nhave been already obtained and put into operation by the magistrates and\r\nauthorities of that city.\r\n\r\n  “The lodging-houses,” said Dr. Cowan, “are the media through which the\r\n  newly-arrived immigrants find their way to the fever hospital; and it\r\n  is remarkable how many of the inmates of that hospital, coming from\r\n  lodging-houses, have not been six months in the city.” He might have\r\n  added, these lodging-houses are the great _foci_ of poverty, vice, and\r\n  crime, as well as of disease. These houses are generally of a very\r\n  wretched description, in low, unwholesome situations, exceedingly\r\n  dirty and ill-ventilated, and are frequently crowded to excess, it\r\n  being no uncommon thing to find 8, 10, and 12 persons in one small\r\n  apartment, as 9 feet by 8, or 11 by 8. Some of them also have no beds\r\n  whatever in them, the inmates lying on the bare floor, or with a few\r\n  shavings below them, with their clothes on. A more particular\r\n  description of them will be got in Captain Miller’s Papers on Crime in\r\n  the City Proper, Mr. Rutherglen’s (one of the magistrates) on Calton,\r\n  and Mr. Richardson on the Barony of Gorbals. It would appear from\r\n  these published documents, and from what I have been able to learn\r\n  otherwise, that the lodging-houses in the City Proper are decidedly of\r\n  the worst description; but I am aware that the authorities are\r\n  adopting means to have them in better order in future. In the burgh of\r\n  Anderston they have for some time been under the surveillance of the\r\n  police; and a record is kept of all lodging-houses for the\r\n  accommodation of casual visitors in Gorbals (by which it appears that\r\n  there were lately 92—50 kept by males, and 42 by females; only 25 of\r\n  them entertain the lowest class of poor), so that they may be properly\r\n  regulated. It is only in Calton, however, that they are attended to\r\n  with that strict care which is requisite, and fortunately the last\r\n  Police Act for that burgh gives ample powers for that purpose. It\r\n  provides, by section 20, That no keeper of lodging-houses of an\r\n  inferior description, for the accommodation of mendicant strangers and\r\n  others, shall receive lodgers without the house having been inspected\r\n  and approved of by the superintendent of police, and the\r\n  superintendent is authorized to fix the number of lodgers who may be\r\n  accommodated, and to order a ticket containing the number of lodgers\r\n  for which each house is registered; and any rules or instructions of\r\n  the commissioners of police regarding health, cleanliness, and\r\n  ventilation, to be placed in a conspicuous part of each room in which\r\n  lodgers are received. It also provides that the keepers of such\r\n  lodgings offending against these regulations shall be liable in\r\n  penalties. Section 21 enacts, That in the event of any person in such\r\n  houses becoming ill of fever or other disease, the keepers shall be\r\n  bound to give intimation thereof to the superintendent of police or\r\n  inspector, so that the disease may be inquired into and treated, and\r\n  the magistrates are authorized to order such persons to be removed.\r\n  And section 22 further enacts, That on any contagious or infectious\r\n  disease occurring in any such lodging-houses, or in any house or\r\n  apartment in any house, or apartment in any common tenement, &c.,\r\n  where there is reasonable apprehension of such diseases spreading, the\r\n  magistrates may cause the remaining lodgers to be removed, and\r\n  measures to be taken for the disinfecting and cleaning of the houses\r\n  and apartments, and for the washing and purifying of the persons and\r\n  clothes of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n  “In addition to these excellent provisions, the magistrates of Calton,\r\n  in virtue of the powers in their police Acts, have issued the\r\n  following rules and instructions to be observed by all keepers of\r\n  lodging-houses, viz.—1st. The floors are to be washed at least twice\r\n  in each week, viz., on Wednesday and Saturday. 2nd. The walls are to\r\n  be whitewashed, and the houses thoroughly cleaned, on the 1st day of\r\n  each of the months of June, August, November and March, or on the\r\n  following day if any of these days fall on Sunday. And, 3rd. The\r\n  blankets used in all lodging-houses are to be thoroughly cleaned and\r\n  scoured on the 8th day of each of the months of June, August,\r\n  November, and March, or on the following day if any of these days fall\r\n  on Sunday; and if any person or persons in such house shall be\r\n  affected with fever or other infectious disease, the blankets and bed\r\n  clothes used by such person or persons shall be thoroughly cleaned and\r\n  scoured immediately after the removal of the diseased, and the bedding\r\n  used by persons affected with contagious disease fumigated immediately\r\n  after the removal of such person or persons. And where the bedding\r\n  used is shavings or straw, the same shall be burnt immediately after\r\n  such removal.\r\n\r\n  “These provisions and regulations have been very judiciously enforced\r\n  by the magistrates of Calton and their superintendent of police, and\r\n  have been productive of most beneficial results. In addition to what\r\n  was formerly stated by Bailie Rutherglen, I have now before me a\r\n  distinct statement, by Mr. Smart, regarding the lodging-houses and\r\n  state of fever in Calton, which enables me to give the following\r\n  information:—Between 1st September, 1840, and 1st February last, 319\r\n  persons were brought before the magistrates of Calton for keeping\r\n  unregistered lodging-houses. Of these 216 were ordered to desist from\r\n  keeping lodgers till houses registered, &c.; 91 were fined and\r\n  ordained not to keep lodgers; 12 cases were dismissed. Of the 307\r\n  convicted for keeping unregistered lodging-houses, 90 got their houses\r\n  inspected and registered, 30 removed from the burgh, and 189 gave over\r\n  keeping lodgers, and were refused registration—refused principally on\r\n  account of the want of proper accommodation, and a few for harbouring\r\n  disreputable characters. Mr. Smart also informs me that several\r\n  hundreds of the worst houses of the poorer classes have been\r\n  whitewashed with Irish lime, and the lodging-houses having been put\r\n  under wholesome regulations, a marked improvement has taken place. In\r\n  Whisky-close, New-street, for several years past, as many as 30 cases\r\n  of fever occurred annually. Lime-washed in September last, and the\r\n  vagrants removed; only one case of fever has been known: and Mr. Smart\r\n  concludes, “I believe there are 1000 fever cases less in Calton this\r\n  day than there were on 1st September last.” Why should not the same\r\n  measures that have been so successfully enforced in Calton be\r\n  introduced into the City Proper and the other suburban districts?”\r\n\r\nIt were only a statement of the concurrent opinion of the commissioners\r\nof police, of magistrates, of medical officers, and of the guardians\r\ncharged with the administration of the poor’s rates, to represent the\r\nurgent necessity of legislative provisions for the general adoption of\r\nsimilar measures throughout the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   IX.—RECAPITULATION OF CONCLUSIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last cited instance of the practical operation of measures for the\r\nabatement of the nuisances attendant on common lodging-houses may also\r\nbe submitted as an instance of the advantages derivable from the\r\nextension of such fields of inquiries as the present. On each of the\r\nchief points included in it there would have been a loss of what I hope\r\nwill be deemed valuable corroborative information, had the inquiry been\r\nconfined either to England or to Scotland. The observation of the\r\nimportant productive use of the refuse of the city of Edinburgh would\r\nhave been of comparatively little value as evidence leading to practical\r\napplications, apart from the observation of what is accomplished by the\r\npractical application of science to sewerage and drainage for the\r\nimmediate and cheapest removal of all the refuse of towns by water\r\nthrough closed drains afforded by the operation in the Holborn and\r\nFinsbury division of the metropolis. It may be stated confidently that,\r\nif the inquiry could conveniently have had still further extension as to\r\ntime and place, the information would have been strengthened and\r\nrendered more complete. From incidental facts I have met with, I am led\r\nto believe that the whole of the effects which are the subject of the\r\npresent report would have been still more strikingly displayed in many\r\nparts of Ireland.\r\n\r\nAfter as careful an examination of the evidence collected as I have been\r\nenabled to make, I beg leave to recapitulate the chief conclusions which\r\nthat evidence appears to me to establish.\r\n\r\n_First, as to the extent and operation of the evils which are the\r\nsubject of the inquiry_:—\r\n\r\nThat the various forms of epidemic, endemic, and other disease caused,\r\nor aggravated, or propagated chiefly amongst the labouring classes by\r\natmospheric impurities produced by decomposing animal and vegetable\r\nsubstances, by damp and filth, and close and overcrowded dwellings\r\nprevail amongst the population in every part of the kingdom, whether\r\ndwelling in separate houses, in rural villages, in small towns, in the\r\nlarger towns—as they have been found to prevail in the lowest, districts\r\nof the metropolis.\r\n\r\nThat such disease, wherever its attacks are frequent, is always found in\r\nconnexion with the physical circumstances above specified, and that\r\nwhere those circumstances are removed by drainage, proper cleansing,\r\nbetter ventilation, and other means of diminishing atmospheric impurity,\r\nthe frequency and intensity of such disease is abated; and where the\r\nremoval of the noxious agencies appears to be complete, such disease\r\nalmost entirely disappears.\r\n\r\nThat high prosperity in respect to employment and wages, and various and\r\nabundant food, have afforded to the labouring classes no exemptions from\r\nattacks of epidemic disease, which have been as frequent and as fatal in\r\nperiods of commercial and manufacturing prosperity as in any others.\r\n\r\nThat the formation of all habits of cleanliness is obstructed by\r\ndefective supplies of water.\r\n\r\nThat the annual loss of life from filth and bad ventilation are greater\r\nthan the loss from death or wounds in any wars in which the country has\r\nbeen engaged in modern times.\r\n\r\nThat of the 43,000 cases of widowhood, and 112,000 cases of destitute\r\norphanage relieved from the poor’s rates in England and Wales alone, it\r\nappears that the greatest proportion of deaths of the heads of families\r\noccurred from the above specified and other removable causes; that their\r\nages were under 45 years; that is to say, 13 years below the natural\r\nprobabilities of life as shown by the experience of the whole population\r\nof Sweden.\r\n\r\nThat the public loss from the premature deaths of the heads of families\r\nis greater than can be represented by any enumeration of the pecuniary\r\nburdens consequent upon their sickness and death.\r\n\r\nThat, measuring the loss of working ability amongst large classes by the\r\ninstances of gain, even from incomplete arrangements for the removal of\r\nnoxious influences from places of work or from abodes, that this loss\r\ncannot be less than eight or ten years.\r\n\r\nThat the ravages of epidemics and other diseases do not diminish but\r\ntend to increase the pressure of population.\r\n\r\nThat in the districts where the mortality is the greatest the births are\r\nnot only sufficient to replace the numbers removed by death, but to add\r\nto the population.\r\n\r\nThat the younger population, bred up under noxious physical agencies, is\r\ninferior in physical organization and general health to a population\r\npreserved from the presence of such agencies.\r\n\r\nThat the population so exposed is less susceptible of moral influences,\r\nand the effects of education are more transient than with a healthy\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThat these adverse circumstances tend to produce an adult population\r\nshort-lived, improvident, reckless, and intemperate, and with habitual\r\navidity for sensual gratifications.\r\n\r\nThat these habits lead to the abandonment of all the conveniences and\r\ndecencies of life, and especially lead to the overcrowding of their\r\nhomes, which is destructive to the morality as well as the health of\r\nlarge classes of both sexes.\r\n\r\nThat defective town cleansing fosters habits of the most abject\r\ndegradation and tends to the demoralization of large numbers of human\r\nbeings, who subsist by means of what they find amidst the noxious filth\r\naccumulated in neglected streets and bye-places.\r\n\r\nThat the expenses of local public works are in general unequally and\r\nunfairly assessed, oppressively and uneconomically collected, by\r\nseparate collections, wastefully expended in separate and inefficient\r\noperations by unskilled and practically irresponsible officers.\r\n\r\nThat the existing law for the protection of the public health and the\r\nconstitutional machinery for reclaiming its execution, such as the\r\nCourts Leet, have fallen into desuetude, and are in the state indicated\r\nby the prevalence of the evils they were intended to prevent.\r\n\r\n_Secondly. As to the means by which the present sanitary condition of\r\nthe labouring classes may be improved_:—\r\n\r\nThe primary and most important measures, and at the same time the most\r\npracticable, and within the recognized province of public\r\nadministration, are drainage, the removal of all refuse of habitations,\r\nstreets, and roads, and the improvement of the supplies of water.\r\n\r\nThat the chief obstacles to the immediate removal of decomposing refuse\r\nof towns and habitations have been the expense and annoyance of the hand\r\nlabour and cartage requisite for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThat this expense may be reduced to one-twentieth or to one-thirtieth,\r\nor rendered inconsiderable, by the use of water and self-acting means of\r\nremoval by improved and cheaper sewers and drains.\r\n\r\nThat refuse when thus held in suspension in water may be most cheaply\r\nand innoxiously conveyed to any distance out of towns, and also in the\r\nbest form for productive use, and that the loss and injury by the\r\npollution of natural streams may be avoided. That for all these\r\npurposes, as well as for domestic use, better supplies of water are\r\nabsolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nThat for successful and economical drainage the adoption of geological\r\nareas as the basis of operations is requisite.\r\n\r\nThat appropriate scientific arrangements for public drainage would\r\nafford important facilities for private land-drainage, which is\r\nimportant for the health as well as sustenance of the labouring classes.\r\n\r\nThat the expense of public drainage, of supplies of water laid on in\r\nhouses, and of means of improved cleansing would be a pecuniary gain, by\r\ndiminishing the existing charges attendant on sickness and premature\r\nmortality.\r\n\r\nThat for the protection of the labouring classes and of the ratepayers\r\nagainst inefficiency and waste in all new structural arrangements for\r\nthe protection of the public health, and to ensure public confidence\r\nthat the expenditure will be beneficial, securities should be taken that\r\nall new local public works are devised and conducted by responsible\r\nofficers qualified by the possession of the science and skill of civil\r\nengineers.\r\n\r\nThat the oppressiveness and injustice of levies for the whole immediate\r\noutlay on such works upon persons who have only short interests in the\r\nbenefits may be avoided by care in spreading the expense over periods\r\ncoincident with the benefits.\r\n\r\nThat by appropriate arrangements, 10 or 15 per cent. on the ordinary\r\noutlay for drainage might be saved, which on an estimate of the expense\r\nof the necessary structural alterations of one-third only of the\r\nexisting tenements would be a saving of one million and a half sterling,\r\nbesides the reduction of the future expenses of management.\r\n\r\nThat for the prevention of the disease occasioned by defective\r\nventilation, and other causes of impurity in places of work and other\r\nplaces where large numbers are assembled, and for the general promotion\r\nof the means necessary to prevent disease, that it would be good economy\r\nto appoint a district medical officer independent of private practice,\r\nand with the securities of special qualifications and responsibilities\r\nto initiate sanitary measures and reclaim the execution of the law.\r\n\r\nThat by the combinations of all these arrangements, it is probable that\r\nthe full ensurable period of life indicated by the Swedish tables; that\r\nis, an increase of 13 years at least, may be extended to the whole of\r\nthe labouring classes.\r\n\r\nThat the attainment of these and the other collateral advantages of\r\nreducing existing charges and expenditure are within the power of the\r\nlegislature, and are dependent mainly on the securities taken for the\r\napplication of practical science, skill, and economy in the direction of\r\nlocal public works.\r\n\r\nAnd that the removal of noxious physical circumstances, and the\r\npromotion of civic, household, and personal cleanliness, are necessary\r\nto the improvement of the moral condition of the population; for that\r\nsound morality and refinement in manners and health are not long found\r\nco-existant with filthy habits amongst any class of the community.\r\n\r\nI beg leave further to suggest, that the principles of amendment deduced\r\nfrom the inquiry will be found as applicable to Scotland as to England;\r\nand if so, it may be submitted for attention whether it might not be\r\nrepresented that the structural arrangements for drainage would be most\r\nconveniently carried out in the same form as in England, that is by\r\ncommissions, of the nature of commissions of sewers adapted, as regards\r\njurisdiction to natural or geological areas, and including in them the\r\nchief elected officers of municipalities, and other authorities now\r\ncharged with the care of the streets and roads or connected with local\r\npublic works.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of uniformity in legislation and in the executive\r\nmachinery, and of doing the same things in the same way (choosing the\r\nbest), and calling the same officers, proceedings, and things by the\r\nsame names, will only be appreciated by those who have observed the\r\nextensive public loss occasioned by the legislation for towns which\r\nmakes them independent of beneficent, as of what perhaps might have been\r\ndeemed formerly aggressive legislation. There are various sanitary\r\nregulations, and especially those for cleansing, directed to be observed\r\nin “every town except Berwick and Carlisle;” a course of legislation\r\nwhich, had it been efficient for England, would have left Berwick and\r\nCarlisle distinguished by the oppression of common evils intended to be\r\nremedied. It was the subject, of public complaint, at Glasgow and in\r\nother parts of Scotland, that independence and separation in the form of\r\ngeneral legislation separated the people from their share of the\r\ngreatest amount of legislative attention, or excluded them from common\r\ninterest and from the common advantages of protective measures. It was,\r\nfor example, the subject of particular complaint, that whilst the\r\nlabouring population of England and Ireland had received the advantages\r\nof public legislative provision for a general vaccination, the labouring\r\nclasses in Scotland were still left exposed to the ravages of the\r\nsmall-pox. It was also complained by Dr. Cowan and other members of the\r\nmedical profession, that Scotland had not been included in the\r\nprovisions for the registration of the causes of death which they\r\nconsidered might, with improvements, be made highly conducive to the\r\nadvancement of medical science and the means of protecting the public\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\n                              I have the honour to be,\r\n                                              Gentlemen,\r\n                                                  Your obedient servant,\r\n                                                      EDWIN CHADWICK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    1.—_Evidence of_ MR. JOHN ROE, _Civil Engineer, on the Practical\r\n Improvement in Sewerage and Drainage tried in the Holborn and Finsbury\r\n                     Divisions of the Metropolis_.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are the surveyor to the Holborn and Finsbury Commission of\r\nSewers?—Yes, I am.\r\n\r\nBy profession you are an engineer?—Yes; I have been engaged as an\r\nengineer in the formation of canals and railways, and in the drainage\r\nincident to such works.\r\n\r\nHow long have you acted as surveyor to this branch of sewerage in the\r\nmetropolis?—Nearly four years.\r\n\r\nHave you observed the general state of the sewerage of the metropolis?—I\r\nhave only seen some of the sewers of other divisions, but I am generally\r\nacquainted with the principle of their construction.\r\n\r\nIs it generally the same as that in which you found the sewers in the\r\nHolborn and Finsbury divisions?—Yes, except that the forms differ in a\r\ndegree; some are flat-bottomed sewers, others segment-bottomed. For a\r\nlong time the Holborn and Finsbury divisions have used bottoms of a\r\nsemicircular form.\r\n\r\nThe effect of a flat-bottomed sewer, it is to be presumed, when the\r\nwater is shallow and the flow slow, is to leave a larger quantity of\r\ndeposit?—Yes; it flows sometimes in a channel, leaving a deposit on each\r\nside; sometimes the water flows on one side, leaving a deposit on the\r\nother; but in all cases the flat-bottomed sewers occasion a larger\r\namount of deposit with the same flow of water: it is more than one-half\r\ndifference of the deposit which is left.\r\n\r\nWhat proportion of the sewerage of the metropolis do you believe to be\r\nflat-bottomed?—I have not examined the other divisions, but I believe\r\nthe greater proportion of the sewerage to be flat-bottomed. In the City\r\nthey have built some of their sewers in a form nearly similar to those\r\nadopted in the Holborn and Finsbury divisions; that is, approaching to\r\nsemicircular. In the Westminster division the invert is a segment of a\r\ncircle, whose chord being three feet the versed sine is six inches. Most\r\nnew sewers are making an approach to the better form by having segments.\r\n\r\nIs it not the fact that in proportion as the bottom approaches a plane\r\nit approaches to the inconvenience of the flat-bottomed sewers, and\r\nweakens the force of the current?—Yes, in a degree, it does.\r\n\r\nAre there any practical inconveniences, or is there any material\r\nincrease of expense in building semicircular bottoms?—None; and if the\r\nsides are curved also it forms the stronger sewer for the same expense.\r\n\r\nHow are the sides of the sewers generally built?—As far as I am\r\ninformed, they are built with upright walls. I know none but the new\r\nsewers in the Holborn and Finsbury divisions that are built with curved\r\nsides, though I have no doubt that if any new sewers are built under the\r\nsuperintendence of Mr. Walker, who is president of the Engineers’\r\nSociety, he would build them with curved sides.\r\n\r\nWhat are the disadvantages of the flat-sided sewers?—They are not\r\ncalculated to afford the greatest strength. In clayey or slippery\r\nground, where there is a pressure on the sides, they are more easily\r\nforced in. I have myself seen instances where expensive sewers have been\r\nforced in at the sides. The curved side gives the strength of an arch in\r\nresisting such pressure.\r\n\r\nIs there any addition of expense in the construction of such forms of\r\nsewers as you describe?—Less expense; there is less brick-work required.\r\nAs compared with some upright sewers with footings, the difference will\r\nbe two shillings in first size sewers, and four shillings per foot\r\nlineal in sewers of the second size, in favour of the curved sewers.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the levels, how have you found the sewers?—They appear to\r\nhave been entirely constructed with reference to the locality, to drain\r\nto the nearest outlet, and not on an extended view for the whole\r\ndistrict, or with any view to sewerage on a large scale. In the Holborn\r\nand Finsbury divisions the Commissioners now adopt a series of levels\r\nsuited from the lowest outlets to the surrounding districts.\r\n\r\nHave you heard of any alterations made in the surrounding districts on\r\nthe same principle?—I have heard of none as adopted generally. The City\r\nhave lowered several of their outlets; and Mr. Donaldson, on the\r\nWestminster, has had the subject under consideration for some time.\r\n\r\nWhat are the chief effects of the piecemeal town drainage without\r\nreference to extended levels?—Chiefly that when new lines of houses are\r\nbuilt and require new sewers, either the old sewers must be taken up and\r\nre-constructed at a great expense, to adjust them to a new and effective\r\nsewerage, or the new sewers, if they are adjusted to the old ones, are\r\ndeficient in fall, and they have greater deposits.\r\n\r\nDoes the existing form or system of sewerage answer fully and at the\r\nleast expense the chief objects of sewerage in house and street\r\ncleansing, and the removal of noxious substances?—No, it does not,\r\nexcept where the outlets have been lowered, and the sewers continued at\r\na proper level; great accumulations of deposit are occasioned in the\r\nsewers, and from their containing the refuse that was at one time\r\ndeposited in the cesspools, the deposit is more noxious than formerly;\r\nthe gas is more considerable, it escapes more extensively into streets\r\nand into the houses, where the drains are not well trapped. My opinion\r\nis that the general health of the men who work and have been accustomed\r\nto the sewers, has become still worse; they are more pale and thin, and\r\nlower in general health than formerly. The effect of the noxious gases\r\nupon men working in these places is to lower the general health. Since I\r\nhave had the superintendence of the sewers, the men have encountered\r\nabout half a dozen accidents by explosions of gas.\r\n\r\nBut is the health of these men who work in the sewers to be taken as a\r\ncriterion of the health of persons who are not accustomed to such\r\nplaces?—I have had no means of forming a comparison, though I am of\r\nopinion that gases which they encounter without any immediate injury\r\nwould be very injurious to the health of susceptible persons, or of any\r\npersons not habituated to it.\r\n\r\nThe first prejudicial effect of the defective system, then, is to\r\noccasion these noxious accumulations; how are they removed?—Formerly, in\r\nthe Holborn and Finsbury sewers, and at present, I believe, in all other\r\nsewers, the streets were opened at a great expense and obstruction (they\r\nare so now, I believe, elsewhere); men descend, scoop up the deposit\r\ninto pails, which are raised by a windlass to the surface, and laid\r\nthere until the carts come; it is laid there until it is carted away,\r\nsometimes for several hours, to the public annoyance and prejudice. The\r\ncontract price for removal from the old sewers without man-holes was\r\n11_s._ per cubic yard of slop removed; where they have man-holes it was\r\n6_s._ 10_d._ per cubic yard. This practice also involves injury and\r\nexpense as respects the pavement; a street may be well paved when it is\r\nbroken up for the cleansing of the sewers, but the portions of pavements\r\nso disturbed are never so well put down again; neither can accidents be\r\neffectually guarded against.\r\n\r\nBy what means may these effects be obviated?—In the Holborn and Finsbury\r\ndivisions I suggested a plan of flushing the sewers, and of carrying off\r\nall the refuse by water. This plan has been adopted, and it is now in\r\noperation. The breaking up of the streets is avoided by the formation of\r\nside entrances; cast-iron flushing gates are fixed in the sewers; the\r\nordinary flow of water in the sewers accumulates at these gates; the\r\ngates are opened, and the force of the water is sufficient to sweep off\r\nthe deposit; and the system may be further extended.\r\n\r\nWhat is the comparative difference in the expense of construction?—The\r\ncost of side entrances and flood-gates, as compared with the cost of\r\nman-holes, is from 6_d._ to 1_s._ less per foot lineal of the length of\r\nnew sewers.\r\n\r\nWhat other expense is attendant on this improved practice?—The main\r\nexpense is the attendance of a man to shut and open the flood-gates.\r\n\r\nThe structural expense being lower, is the ultimate expense of cleansing\r\nlower also?—Yes; the expense of cleansing the sewers is about 50 per\r\ncent. less than the prevalent mode. Our expense of cleansing the sewers\r\nwas about 1200_l._ per annum; we save 600_l._ of that, and expect to\r\nsave more; but to this must be added the saving to the public of the\r\ncleansing of the private drains, formerly choked by the accumulations in\r\nthe sewers. This saving, on a moderate calculation, is found to be\r\nupwards of 300_l._ per annum. There is also the diminution of the\r\nescapes of gas from the old and continued accumulations.\r\n\r\nDuring what intervals are deposits allowed to remain on the old\r\nmode?—The average is in one set of sewers about five years, and in\r\nanother about ten years.\r\n\r\nDuring which time the public are subjected to all the escapes of gas\r\nfrom the decomposing accumulation?—Exactly so. It could not, however, go\r\non so long but for heavy falls of rain or snow, which occasion partial\r\nclearances.\r\n\r\nWhat is the effect of these accumulations upon the private\r\ndrainage?—That the drains to the private houses are stopped: the first\r\nintimation of the foul state of the main sewer arises from complaints of\r\nindividuals whose drains are affected; the accumulations in the private\r\ndrains also occasion an expense to the individuals and much annoyance.\r\nBy flushing the sewers this expense might be, and in the Holborn and\r\nFinsbury division it is, avoided.\r\n\r\nMight not the price of sewers be reduced even below those you have now\r\nin use, the egg-shaped sewers?—With the radiated bricks, I think that\r\nthe same capacity of sewerage may be secured with less thickness of\r\nbrick-work. I have given in an estimate of second-class sewers at 10_s._\r\n6_d._ per foot lineal; which is 7_s._ 6_d._ per foot less than the\r\ncommon flat-bottomed sewer with footing.\r\n\r\nIn these main drains a man may go up to examine them. Admitting them to\r\nbe necessary for the large towns, might not a smaller and less expensive\r\ndrainage suffice for small towns and villages?—There are situations in\r\ncourts, alleys, and small streets, where a less expensive form of\r\ndrainage would suffice. In fact 18–inch drains for short lengths,\r\ncosting, if made of radiated bricks, 4_s._ 6_d._ per foot, would\r\nsuffice; they would act well in proportion to the goodness of the falls.\r\n\r\nHave you found the system of cleansing the large drains by flushing with\r\nproper supplies of water equally applicable to small drains?—Yes,\r\nequally applicable. A gentleman has tried it on a private drain of\r\n18–inch capacity, and 1200 feet length, and it answers equally well. It\r\nis cleansed by the collection of refuse water from 30 or 40 houses.\r\n\r\nMight not the drains from private houses be also cleansed in the same\r\nmode?—Yes, they might have a small and cheap apparatus for carrying away\r\nall ordinary refuse. If in the small drain a brick fell in, it could not\r\nbe removed by the force of the small quantity of water which could be\r\nobtained in such a situation. In our large sewers the heads of water are\r\nin some cases strong enough to sweep away loose bricks.\r\n\r\nWould it not be of advantage to the occupier, if the private drains were\r\nunder the same general superintendence?—I conceive it would in\r\nmanagement. They are frequently put to great expense by getting persons\r\nto attend to them who really do not understand them. They are often now\r\nobliged to have recourse to the contractor’s men. Private property is\r\noften drained through other private property, and when the drains are\r\nchoked, if the parties are not on good terms they will not allow each\r\nother facilities for cleansing. Under the Finsbury local Act there is a\r\npower to enforce the cleansing of private drains, and by way of appeal\r\nthat power is sometimes resorted to by private individuals.\r\n\r\nMay we not presume that the same principles of hydraulics, as to the\r\nadvantages of a flow over a semi circular bottom, are as applicable to\r\nsmall drains as to large ones?—More so from the flow of water being\r\nsmaller; the greater necessity for keeping it in a body to enable it to\r\ncarry away the common deposit.\r\n\r\nThen there is a proportionate loss in having the private drainage made\r\nwith flat-bottomed bricks or boards?—Yes, there is proportionate loss\r\nfrom the extra cost of cleansing. Semicircular drains of tiles would be\r\nbetter, and cheaper than brick, for private houses.\r\n\r\nAre there any other defects you have, as an engineer, noticed in the\r\nprevalent mode of constructing the sewers?—Yes, the prevalent practice\r\nis to join sewers at angles, frequently at right angles; this occasions\r\neddies and deposits of sediment that would otherwise pass off with the\r\nwater; it injures the capacity of the main sewers by obstructing the\r\ncurrent of water along them: I ascertained by experiment that the time\r\noccupied in the passage of an equal quantity of water, along similar\r\nlengths of sewer with equal falls, was—\r\n\r\n                                              Seconds.\r\n                  Along a straight line             90\r\n                  With a true curve                100\r\n                  With a turn at right angles      140\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners of the Holborn and Finsbury divisions agreed to\r\nrequire that the curves in sewers, passing from one street to another,\r\nshall be formed with a radius of not less than 20 feet; it is also\r\nrequired that the inclination or fall shall be increased at the\r\njunction, in order to preserve an equal capacity for the passage of\r\nwater, and of effect in sweeping away the deposit.\r\n\r\nWhen by heavy falls of snow or otherwise the refuse of the streets is\r\ncarried into such sewers, is there any difficulty in sweeping it\r\naway?—None whatsoever.\r\n\r\nHow are the gully-holes or entrances to the drains affected by such\r\ndeposits?—Under the prevalent system the gullies and shoots are formed\r\nso as to retain deposit, on the principle that it is cheaper to get the\r\ndeposit out of those than out of the sewers. The Commissioners in\r\nHolborn and Finsbury, having adopted the flushing principle, have also\r\nadopted a new description of gully and shoot, which I proposed to them\r\nfor the purpose of conveying the whole of the deposit into the sewers;\r\nit is then washed away by the flushing.\r\n\r\nIn what number of years would the saving in cleansing sewers by flushing\r\nrepay the expense of applying the apparatus to the existing sewers in\r\nthe Holborn and Finsbury divisions?—In seven years.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the expense of the construction of chimneys to remove the\r\nfoul air from sewers?—The expense would depend upon the sort and form of\r\nchimney that might be used. A suggestion of Mr. Stable, one of the chief\r\nclerks of the Holborn and Finsbury commission, appears to meet the case\r\nat the least expense. He suggests that the pipes used to carry off the\r\nrain-water from the roofs of houses should be connected with the crown\r\nof the sewers; thus forming a chimney for carrying off the effluvia from\r\nthe sewers, and also a conveyance for the rain-water into the sewers.\r\nThe cost of connecting one such pipe with a sewer would, on an average,\r\nbe about 3_l._ 16_s._ 2_d._\r\n\r\nHave you any doubt of the practicability of carrying all the surface\r\ncleansing of the streets into the sewers, and removing it by conveyance\r\nin water, as was proposed at Paris, instead of by hand labour and\r\ncartage?—I entertain no doubt whatever that it might be done, where\r\nthere is a good sewer and proper gully-holes and shoots; with a good\r\nsupply of water these would carry away rapidly all the surface refuse;\r\nthe experience of the sewerage in the Holborn and Finsbury divisions\r\nprove it.\r\n\r\nHow does it prove it?—At every opportunity the street-sweepers sweep all\r\nthey can into the gully-holes, and it is swept away without\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\nOne practical witness states that the expense of the cartage alone of\r\nthe refuse from a Macadamised street of half a mile, in the winter time\r\nin the metropolis, is 5_l._ weekly. What would be the comparative\r\nexpense of carrying it away by the sewers?—It would save the whole\r\nexpense of the cartage; it would be less than the present expense of\r\nsweeping and filling into the carts, and if there were a sufficient\r\nsupply of water on the surface, the work might be conducted with great\r\nrapidity.\r\n\r\nYou are aware that one inconvenience of the existing mode of street\r\ncleansing, independently of the great expense, is the length of time\r\nduring which the wet refuse remains to the public annoyance on the\r\nsurface, until removed by the slow process of sweeping and cartage?—Yes;\r\nand the men would appear to delay for the purpose of the dirt being\r\nremoved, by being washed by rain into the sewers.\r\n\r\nDo you conceive that all the business of street cleansing and house\r\ndraining might be consolidated advantageously to the public?—Yes,\r\nclearly so, and with great economy.\r\n\r\nHave you, as an engineer, had experience in road construction?—Yes, I\r\nhave, having taken the levels and surveys preparatory to an Act of\r\nParliament being obtained for lowering the Long Compton Hills in\r\nWarwickshire; I afterwards constructed the new line of road on Mr.\r\nTelford’s principle.\r\n\r\nConsidering the drainage of a new district: the under-drainage of the\r\nroads and houses and the surface cleansing, would not the public gain by\r\nputting the drainage, the road-construction, repair and maintenance of\r\nthe roads, under the same management?—Yes, the public would get it done\r\nmuch better by one surveyor and one Board than by two. In the old\r\ndistricts, besides the double expense of officers, inconveniences arise\r\nfrom the want of unity between the contractors for the paving and the\r\ncontractors for the drainage; there is always conflicting interests\r\nbetween the two, and the work is not in many cases done with the economy\r\nand expedition which would be practicable.\r\n\r\nIf the public, who may be ignorant of the science of sewerage and of\r\nwhat it may accomplish, make no complaints, and do not agitate for the\r\nadoption of any improved system, in how long a time do you think the\r\nimprovements demonstrated in the Holborn and Finsbury divisions would\r\nreach the other end of the metropolis by the force of imitation and\r\nvoluntary adoption?—From the apathy shown and prejudice against anything\r\nnew, however valuable it may be as an improvement, and the various\r\ninterests affected, such as the contractors for cleansing, I do not\r\nexpect that they would become general in the metropolis during my\r\nlife-time. The public are passive, and the adverse interests are active.\r\n\r\nYou know the description of persons engaged as surveyors of various\r\ndescriptions in the rural districts and in the smaller towns?—Yes, I do.\r\n\r\nUnless care be taken, is it to be apprehended that any new expenditure\r\nwill be made on imperfect and unwholesome drains with flat bottoms and\r\non false principles at a disproportionate expense?—Undoubtedly, except\r\nthey have to act on rule, it will certainly be so throughout the\r\ncountry. The drainage that I have seen in the country districts is worse\r\nthan in the metropolis.\r\n\r\nHave you found the sewerage produce any effect in the drainage of the\r\nsurrounding land?—Yes, we have found it lower the water in the wells,\r\noften at great distances. For instance, in forming a sewer in the City\r\nRoad we found that it lowered by four feet a well nearly a quarter of a\r\nmile distance. The only remedy we could advise to the parties was to\r\nlower the well: they did so. We afterwards had occasion to lower the\r\nsame sewer three feet, when the well was lowered again in proportion; so\r\nthat the construction of the sewer, in this instance, drained an area of\r\n40 or 50 acres on that side, and perhaps further. The water is sometimes\r\nin such quantities and so strong in the land springs as to require\r\nopenings to be left in the side of the sewer for its passage.\r\n\r\nAre there any fees taken in the Holborn and Finsbury divisions?—None.\r\n\r\nDo you think the system of the payment of officers by fees\r\nobjectionable?—Yes, highly so.\r\n\r\n“Have you met with instances where the drains have not acted, owing to\r\nthe inadequacy of the supplies of water?—I have not had my attention\r\ncalled particularly to any private drain, so as to notice whether it did\r\nnot act owing to an inadequate supply of water, but taking the question\r\non the broad principle of the effect of a sufficient supply of water to\r\ndrains or sewers as beneficial in keeping them free from deposit, I beg\r\nto state that I have noticed the effect on sewers of the same form and\r\nhaving the same fall or inclination, and I have found that where there\r\nhas been an adequate supply of water no deposit has remained in them,\r\nwhereas where the supply of water was inadequate, deposit has\r\naccumulated so much as to render cleansing necessary in a few years: the\r\neffect must be the same in private drains.”\r\n\r\n[Figure 1 is a representation of the form of the common sewers built in\r\nthe Westminster division. It is a transverse section, representing, on a\r\nscale of a quarter of an inch to a foot, a sewer of the larger sort, the\r\ngreatest height being five feet six inches and the width three feet. The\r\nsmaller sewers are made of the same form, but only five feet high and\r\ntwo feet six inches wide. It chiefly differs from the more common form\r\nof sewers in not having a perfectly flat bottom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Fig. 1._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe following figures, 1, 2, are representations of the sewers in the\r\nHolborn and Finsbury division of the metropolis, on the same scale as\r\nthe above. The part in which the joints are marked in the cut is,\r\naccording to the directions, to be worked in blocks with cement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Fig. 1._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Fig. 2._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe sides of these sewers form the curves of large radii struck from the\r\ncentres on the lines _a_ _a_, the radius for the larger size being about\r\n13 feet, and that for the smaller size in proportion.\r\n\r\nThe spaciousness of the sewerage in the Westminster division of the\r\nmetropolis has been an object of pride; and it is stated that the\r\ncommissioners have walked in procession down one main sewer prepared for\r\nthe purpose. It was the glory of Rome that some of its cloacæ were so\r\nlarge that boats and chariots might pass through them. All this,\r\nhowever, appears to have been mistaken in principle, and in ignorance of\r\nthe mischiefs of the generation of gases and of the principles of\r\nhydraulics, and their application for the attainment of the objects in\r\nquestion. Mr. Smith, of Deanston, who has introduced the greatest\r\nimprovements in land drainage, advances the general principle, that the\r\nsize of sewers should be so adjusted as to have them always as full as\r\npossible, with a quick flow; and he contends that the drainage of a city\r\nmight and should be so constructed as to give rise to as little occasion\r\nfor men to go through the main drains as there is for men to go through\r\nthe main pipes for conveying supplies of water. He would make the drains\r\nnarrow. “Their transverse section should exhibit an oval or egg-shape,\r\nhaving the vertical diameter at least double the length of the\r\nhorizontal. The bricks used should be made on purpose, with radiating\r\nsides.” “Care should be taken to make the building water-tight and\r\nair-tight, and to prevent the foul water and effluvia passing into the\r\ncontiguous soil. Where land drainage is to be received, special openings\r\ncan be made at intervals to receive it. All private drainage should pass\r\ninto the sewers under ground by well-secured channels or pipes. Strong\r\nclay pipes, of an oval section, hard burned, and with a good arrangement\r\nfor secure jointing, might be cheaply procured for the purpose.” It may\r\nbe said that there is scarcely any drainage, even in the opulent\r\ndistricts, that at present meets these conditions. E. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n 2.—_Evidence of_ MR. JOHN DARKE, _Contractor for Cleansing, as to the\r\n    Obstacles to Cleansing, and the Conversion of the Refuse of the\r\n                     Metropolis to Productive Use_.\r\n\r\nWhat are the practical difficulties you find in the way of the cheap\r\ncleansing of the streets and houses of the metropolis?—The great\r\ndifficulty of the cleansing of the metropolis arises from the want of\r\nproper receptacles for the filth. There is no filth in the metropolis\r\nthat now, as a general rule, will pay the expense of collection and\r\nremoval by cart, except the ashes from the houses and the soap lees from\r\nthe soap-boilers; and some of the night-soil from the east end of the\r\ntown, where there happen to be in the immediate vicinity some\r\nmarket-gardens, where it can be used at once, without distant or\r\nexpensive cartage. The charge for removing night-soil from the poorest\r\ntenements may be about 1_l._ per tenement. One house with another, the\r\nexpense may be said to be in London about 10_s._ per year, as the\r\ncesspools may be emptied once in two years. One house with another they\r\nwill not produce more than a load of refuse from the cesspools, which,\r\nnot being composed, there is great absorption of the liquid refuse. I\r\nhave given away thousands of loads of night-soil; as we have no means of\r\ndisposing of it, we know not what to do with it.\r\n\r\nWhat is the distance from the metropolis at which refuse is used?—The\r\nexpense of cartage of course increases with the distance. The average\r\nextent of use of it as deposit does not exceed three miles from the\r\nPost-office district in the city of London. Some night-soil has been\r\ndried, packed up in the returned sugar hogsheads, and sent to the West\r\nIndies for use as manure.\r\n\r\nIs it not conveyed away from London by canal?—We do not at present, but\r\nit might be. There is a penalty in the local Act of 5_l._, for\r\ndepositing it on the wharf.\r\n\r\nCannot you convey such manure by railway?—No, there is no mode of\r\nconveyance provided. The charge, I believe, is a halfpenny per mile, but\r\nthat is for the use of the rails only; and the company do not favour the\r\ntransit of manure, and the farmer or contractor who would convey it must\r\nprovide engines for himself, which again would not pay. Night soil has\r\nnot yet been used systematically, and there are no places provided for\r\nits reception.\r\n\r\nMight not the refuse be disposed of to better advantage than it now\r\nis?—The refuse of a great portion of the metropolis might be disposed of\r\nto immense advantage, but it must be by operations on a scale beyond the\r\npower of private capitalists. The sweepings of the paved streets is good\r\nas manure: on grassland it is nearly equal to horse-dung; but it\r\ncontains so much seed that it scarcely does on ploughed land for\r\nimmediate use. It produces great quantities of herbage; every year,\r\nhowever, it improves, because the weed is lost from it and the manure is\r\nleft. When the streets are dry, and it will pay for transit, we sell a\r\nfew loads. The sweepings from the Macadamized roads consist so much of\r\ngranite that it is of very little use indeed; and in general the\r\nstreet-sweepings are mixed up with other manure for sale.\r\n\r\n\r\n 3.—_Evidence of_ MR. JOHN TREBLE, _Contractor for Cleansing, as to the\r\n    Obstacles to Cleansing, and the Conversion of the Refuse of the\r\n                    Metropolis to Productive Uses_.\r\n\r\nYou have been engaged in the cleansing of the metropolis, have you\r\nnot?—Yes; I have been engaged, and my father before me, in the general\r\ncartage of materials, and also in extensive business as a nightman, but\r\nI have now retired from business.\r\n\r\nWhat is the usual expense of emptying cesspools?—The full price to\r\nrespectable private houses is 15_s._ per load, but the contract price is\r\nabout 10_s._ per load. The period of emptying is dependent on whether\r\nthere is any drainage from the cesspool, or whether there are any\r\nland-springs. Some would require to be emptied twice or three times\r\na-year, whilst others would go two or three years without being filled.\r\nAbout 1_l._ per annum per tenement would perhaps be the expense one with\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nWhere the cesspools are relieved, is not the ground about\r\nsaturated?—Yes, it is; in digging the foundations of old houses for new\r\nbuildings, the earth is found to be saturated. We have frequently to\r\nempty one person’s place because it is found that the soil has\r\npenetrated through to the neighbours’ houses.\r\n\r\nDoes not this moisture affect the condition of the house?—Yes, and it\r\nwould be good economy for the sake of the house, and keeping a dry\r\nfoundation, to have water-closets and good drainage from the house to\r\nthe sewers.\r\n\r\nBy having the water-closets, the expense of the removal of the soil,\r\nannually or otherwise, would be saved?—Yes; and the expense of the\r\ndearest water-closets bears no proportion to the annual expense of\r\ncleansing, though water-closets I think might be constructed at a less\r\nexpense, on a more simple plan, than they now are. They might be\r\nconstructed on a principle to receive the rain-water and all the liquid\r\nrefuse from the houses, which would increase the cleansing.\r\n\r\nTo effect cleansing on this principle, it will of course be necessary to\r\nhave the water laid on in the house?—Of course it will. It would greatly\r\nassist the cleansing, if the water-companies were required to draw their\r\nplugs once at least in the fortnight. It would cleanse their own pipes,\r\nand assist in the cleansing of the sewers. The company would say that\r\nthat would be a great waste of water, but a sufficient body of water\r\nmight be obtained for the purpose in a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nDoes not the soil bear any value as a manure?—In general it bears no\r\nvalue to the nightman as a manure. One hinderance to any removal to a\r\ndistance is, that, by the police regulations, cesspools can only be\r\nemptied in the night within certain hours. This prevents cartage to any\r\ngreat distance, and cartage is very dear. Some nightmen have paid 6_d._\r\nper load for the liberty of depositing it. The object of the nightmen is\r\nto get rid of the soil early, and return with the cart to complete the\r\nemptying in one night. Formerly, before the new police were so much\r\nabout, the men would empty the cart in any bye street or place where\r\nthey could; they would, when it was in a liquid state, empty it down the\r\nsewers; they do so now when they have an opportunity, and return to\r\ncomplete the job. Formerly the site of the New London University was a\r\nplace in which the refuse was deposited; so was the site of the new row\r\nof grand houses in Hyde Park Gardens. I think the site of Belgrave\r\nSquare was another place of deposit; but those places being built over,\r\nthere is now much difficulty in getting rid of the refuse.\r\n\r\nWhat is the expense of cartage in London?—As a contractor, for the use\r\nof a cart, a man, and horse a-day, I used to charge 9_s._ the day for\r\ncarting stone and rubbish. My successor did it for 7_s._, but I saw his\r\nname yesterday in the Gazette. The cost of the man’s work and the horse\r\nwill amount to 6_s._ or 7_s._ in London.\r\n\r\nWhat distance do your carts in full work travel in London?—A good day’s\r\nwork to send a load out and return empty would be about ten miles; over\r\nhilly parts not so far.\r\n\r\nIs the street refuse of the paved streets valuable as manure?—Yes it is;\r\nbut it is only worth removal when it can be easily carted, that is, when\r\nit is in a dry state. The contractor being obliged to cleanse the\r\nstreets in a given time, it would not pay to have such a number of carts\r\nas to complete the cleansing within the time and carry the refuse to a\r\ndistance. They get rid of the refuse at the nearest place of deposit. In\r\ndry weather they have less to do and can turn their carts to account.\r\nThe refuse is then dry, and it rides well, and may be sold to an\r\nadvantage, and it sometimes fetches half-a-crown a load.\r\n\r\nAt what distance from the place of work would it be delivered at that\r\nprice?—At about three miles distance; not exceeding that.\r\n\r\nIs none of the refuse of the metropolis carried further as manure?—Yes;\r\nsome of the farmers who bring produce to market return with their carts\r\nloaded with dung to greater distances.\r\n\r\nIs not canal conveyance used?—Much of the street cleansing is taken down\r\nthe canals.\r\n\r\nDo the contractors in general pay for the deposit of the refuse of\r\nstreets?—They would pay if they could get places of deposit near their\r\nwork; but all the places out to the outskirts, where any refuse whatever\r\ncould be deposited, are built upon.\r\n\r\nDo not the men sometimes get rid of the surface sweepings into the\r\nsewers?—Yes; they do when it is in a liquid state, and when they are not\r\nwatched.\r\n\r\nDo you happen to know what is the expense of cleansing a street of a\r\ngiven length?—I once contracted to remove the stuff from Bond-street\r\naway; each cleansing took four teams and two stands, as it is called; or\r\ntwo teams and one stand, that is, two two horse carts, and one single\r\nhorse cart standing to be loaded two days in the winter time. The cost\r\nof cartage in the winter season for cleansing that street was about\r\n5_l._ for each cleansing. It was cleansed less frequently than weekly:\r\nthat street is Macadamised. In the summer-time the expense would be less\r\nthan one-half. The expense of cleansing the whole of Marylebone, that\r\nis, the expense of cartage, is about 2,200_l._ per annum, the parish\r\nfinding the sweepers.\r\n\r\n\r\n   4.—_Extract from the Report of_ FOURCROY _and others, showing the\r\n Calculation of the Extent of Pollution of the Seine from the Discharge\r\n                of the Refuse of the Streets of Paris_.\r\n\r\n“Not to neglect the details into which the Ministry desire us to enter,\r\nwe observe that the maximum of daily street-sweepings is, in winter, 684\r\ncubic metres; the minimum is 410; the average is 547.\r\n\r\n“On the other hand, the velocity of the waters of the Seine, measured at\r\ntheir lowest level, being 6 decimetres 5 centimetres a second, and the\r\nprofile of the Seine, measured also at low water, at the bridge of the\r\nRevolution, being 118 metres, we observe that there results, supposing\r\nan uniform velocity in the whole mass, a flow of water of 76 cubic\r\nmetres a second; and in one day a flow of water 9,600 times greater at\r\nlow water than the most considerable volume of the street-sweepings of\r\nParis for the same space of time. This volume of water would be 16,015\r\ntimes greater than that of the street-sweepings, if compared with the\r\nminimum of these last; that is to say, with the sweepings in summer, or\r\nthe time at which the waters of the Seine are lowest. Any error in the\r\ncalculation, arising from the inequality of the velocity in the\r\ndifferent parts of the column formed by the current, is too amply\r\ncompensated by other circumstances to need our consideration.\r\n\r\n“To this is to be added, that the season when the street-sweepings are\r\ngreatest, necessarily accords, all other things being equal, with the\r\nperiod when the water is highest and most rapid, as the period of low\r\nwater answers to that when the refuse is least; and admitting the\r\npreceding calculations, the volume of water would be more than 16,000\r\ntimes greater than the street-sweepings; and this proportion would\r\nincrease considerably when the water is highest, by reason of the double\r\nproportion of height and velocity.\r\n\r\n“It is to be further considered, that a great portion of these sweepings\r\nbeing insoluble in the water, would become precipitated, and unite with\r\nthe mud; that a larger portion still, deposited unequally on the two\r\nbanks, would never reach the bleaching-grounds, or the places where the\r\nwater is drawn, and that consequently their possible relation to the\r\nwater used in the city, reduces itself to a quantity excessively small,\r\nand absolutely inappreciable.”\r\n\r\n\r\n 5.—_Communication from_ CAPTAIN VETCH, _of the Royal Engineers, on the\r\n Structural Arrangements of New Buildings, and Protection of the Public\r\n                                Health_.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,—Agreeable to promise, I forward the following observations on\r\nthe improvement of large towns, as affecting the health, economy, and\r\ncomfort of the inhabitants, and so far as these depend on structural\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nThe points requiring the attention of the engineer and architect may be\r\nstated as follows:—_complete ventilation_, _complete drainage_, ample\r\nsewerage, ample supply of water, and lastly, a ready and good\r\ncommunication between the various portions of the town.\r\n\r\nI should have commenced my observations with the subject of drainage as\r\nthe first in point of order were a new district or town to be built, but\r\nas both drainage, and ventilation, and communication, &c., depend so\r\nmuch on the arrangement of the streets, it may not be superfluous to\r\npremise something on that head. It will be sufficiently obvious that\r\nwhere towns are constructed on a regular plan with straight streets, the\r\ncommunication, ventilation, and drainage is comparatively easy, and far\r\nmore effectual than under contrary circumstances; but it unfortunately\r\nhappens that our large towns contain many narrow, crooked streets, with\r\nlittle or no arrangement, and though it may not be practicable\r\nmaterially to mend what we now find so bad, we cannot fail to perceive\r\nthat a little timeous system and arrangement would have avoided many\r\nevils we now complain of, with a less structural expense and a much\r\nimproved value of property to the owners.\r\n\r\nMany or most of the towns, both in British and Spanish America, are\r\nformed on regular plans, commencing with a square as a nucleus, to the\r\nfaces of which the streets (as they rise) are made parallel, so that\r\nwhatever may be the extent of the town the increments take place in\r\nregular order, until stopped by some natural obstruction; and though it\r\nmay be true we cannot now enjoy the good effect of any such original\r\nprecaution, yet as respects the extension or future increments of our\r\ncities and towns, much benefit may still be derived by resorting to\r\nsystem; and though we cannot now remodel what has been built by\r\nproceeding regularly from a central point to the circumference, yet we\r\nmay adopt an external line or periphery as a basis of operation for the\r\nconstruction of the future extension of the town on a regular plan or\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate for the metropolis that there existed some large\r\nlandowners in its vicinity, as the families of Bedford, Grosvenor, and\r\nPortman, whose taste and spirit corresponded with their means, and that\r\nlarge portions of the increments of London consequently possess all the\r\nadvantages that a well-considered system of utility could require; and\r\nthe benefit of such a circumstance will be best felt by contemplating\r\nwhat effects a contrary proceeding would have produced; and further, the\r\nplans pursued by the above-named families have not only been highly\r\nbeneficial in themselves, but they have served to stimulate the small\r\nproprietors in their vicinity to the same useful ends; and what seems to\r\nbe wanted from the authority of the state is the means of ensuring such\r\nbeneficial measures in all cases, or at least protection against\r\nantagonist or vicious proceedings in the owners of land adjoining towns.\r\n\r\nIt will not fail to be remarked that the increments of London just\r\nalluded to have been constructed chiefly for the abodes of the wealthy,\r\nwho can generally protect themselves, and remove from any noxious\r\nneighbourhood. But the state, as the natural guardian of the poor, is\r\nthe more called upon to interfere with its authority to see that the\r\nstreets and houses intended for the labouring classes are constructed on\r\ncomfortable and sanitary principles.\r\n\r\nMost of our large towns have increased upon small, irregular nuclei, and\r\nreceived their increments chiefly from buildings erected along the roads\r\nbranching into the country, presenting so many main streets radiating\r\nfrom a centre, but leaving the intervening spaces to be irregularly and\r\nimperfectly filled up at subsequent periods as chance or necessity\r\ndirected, and in this manner has arisen the great defect (to be\r\ngenerally observed) of a good lateral connexion between the great\r\nradiating streets.\r\n\r\nSo great indeed is the above defect that it is often difficult to pass\r\nfrom one site in the skirts of a town to an adjacent one without passing\r\ntowards the centre of the town by one radiating street and returning by\r\nanother; this defective construction of towns is the natural result when\r\nthey extend without any reference to a general plan or public\r\nconvenience, and the mode which, in my opinion, would best restore the\r\ncondition of a town so constructed to a commodious and useful state\r\nwould be as follows:\r\n\r\nI would propose, in the first instance, to connect all the radiating\r\nstreets of the town by straight lines drawn as near to the mass of\r\nbuildings in the town as the vacant or unbuilt ground would admit of;\r\nthis operation would have the effect of inclosing the town in an\r\nirregular polygon, upon each side of which, as a normal line, I would\r\npropose to lay out the future streets, one series of which would be\r\nparallel to the normal lines, and another series would be perpendicular\r\nto them, and in this manner the future increments of the town would\r\nproceed on a fixed and uniform system, and would render the lateral\r\nlines of communication as effective as the others, and would afford at\r\nthe same time increased facilities for ventilation and sewerage, and for\r\nthe supplies of water, gas, &c.; and proceeding on this system, it may\r\nfully be anticipated that the building sites would become much more\r\nvaluable to their owners than if they remained to be laid out by\r\nindividual caprice on a disjointed plan. It would be valuable in most\r\ncases that the normal polygon should be formed into a series of streets\r\nof ample dimensions, fit for the reception of public buildings,\r\nparticularly schools; and occurring (as it would do) as the nearest\r\ngreat lateral line of communication to the irregular mass of the town,\r\nit would serve to do much of the duty in way of communication and\r\nventilation which the interior mass had left undone, and was unable to\r\neffect, and might answer as the great respiratory of the town, and would\r\nbe well adapted to serve, if wide enough, and planted, for alamedas, or\r\npublic walks.\r\n\r\nIn London, the line of the New Road and City Road furnishes almost the\r\nonly sample the metropolis possesses of polygon lines of communication,\r\nand the utility of the sample is duly felt and appreciated. In Paris the\r\nline of the Boulevards presents a favourable specimen of the convenience\r\nand comfort of such a construction of streets.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of adhering to system in laying out new towns, or\r\nadditions to old towns, will be much enhanced when we take into\r\nconsideration the means of supplying water, gas, &c. to the houses; and\r\nas the application of science and machinery becomes more extended in\r\nadministering to the comforts of towns, it is manifest the more regular\r\nthe field of their action the more efficacious and economical will be\r\nthe results. On the score of ventilation, as well as for other\r\nconveniences, it is important the streets should intersect and not abut\r\non each other, that the currents of air may have free escape.[49]\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest evils arising from towns extending at caprice,\r\nwithout reference to any general plan, is the vast expense that\r\nsubsequently arises when necessity demands communications to be made\r\nthrough crowded masses of buildings; such events are of frequent\r\noccurrence in the metropolis and other large towns, and so great is the\r\noutlay to remedy what might have been avoided, that no measures proposed\r\nfor the improvement of towns merit such deep attention as these; and it\r\nhas sometimes occurred to me, that instead of applying the funds to\r\nenlarging the leading thoroughfares, the object would in many cases be\r\nbetter served by forming entirely new communications through the worst\r\nconstructed and less costly sites. In this manner we should have two\r\ngood communications instead of one; we should open the means of\r\ncommunication, ventilation, and sewerage to places where at present they\r\nexist most imperfectly, and we should expunge from the map of the town a\r\nnumber of noxious, ill-ventilated ruinous buildings, the seats of dirt,\r\ndisease, and demoralization.\r\n\r\nAnnexed is a plan of the town of Birmingham, on which is traced a study\r\nor design for the future increments of that town on the principles above\r\nproposed, which will serve to illustrate the views of the writer. The\r\nfigure P P P P represents the normal polygon.\r\n\r\n_Increments._—It is hardly to be expected that any very uniform plan of\r\nbuilding can be rigidly adhered to; moral as well as physical\r\ndifficulties may demand departure from regularity in the construction of\r\nthe future increments of a town, particularly where the field to be\r\noccupied is extensive; but so long as the general principles are adhered\r\nto, and the new streets proceeded with, upon a general preconceived and\r\nauthorized plan, all the needful objects may be attained; and it has\r\noccurred to me that the mode most likely to give satisfaction to the\r\ninhabitants would be for the municipal authorities to offer a premium\r\nfor the best design for the extension of the town, and of leaving the\r\nselection to the majority of the ratepayers.\r\n\r\n                           TOWN OF BIRMINGHAM,\r\n\r\n _To illustrate the mode proposed for constructing the future increments\r\n     of an irregular Town, upon principles of general convenience and\r\n                                utility._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Standidge & Co. Litho. London_]\r\n\r\nProprietors of large spaces of ground, or a combination of small ones,\r\nmight also claim and be authorized to form and execute their own plans,\r\nprovided always that they were previously submitted to examination and\r\napproval by properly constituted authorities.\r\n\r\nIt has been omitted to mention, that towns built on a regular plan, and\r\nupon sanitary and commodious principles, are much less liable to the\r\naccidents of fire, and the consequent loss of life and property; and\r\nwhen such do occur, the facility of extinguishing them is much greater;\r\nand one might also venture to predict that it will be found that the new\r\ntown of Edinburgh has suffered less from fire than any other town in\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nPrevention against fire is a subject well meriting consideration when\r\ntreating of the improvement of towns. It would seem that fires more\r\nparticularly occur in large public and private buildings, as for\r\ninstance, the Albion Mills, the theatres of Drury-lane and\r\nCovent-garden, the Houses of Parliament, the Great Armoury in the Tower,\r\nRoyal Exchange, &c.; and it would be well to provide that all such\r\nbuildings should be detached, as well as manufactories and all buildings\r\ncontaining steam-engines: but previous to legislating on the subject it\r\nwould be desirable to collect the statistics of conflagration, which\r\nmight readily be obtained from the fire-insurance offices.\r\n\r\n_Ventilation._—In new towns, or the increments of old towns, good\r\nventilation will be best secured by attending to the principles laid\r\ndown for the construction of such.\r\n\r\nThe noxious ingredients which must exist more or less in the atmospheres\r\nof all large towns may be dissipated by currents of air, or diluted by\r\naccess to large open spaces, while the origin of the evil may be much\r\nreduced by a good system of sewerage.\r\n\r\nFor the removal of noxious vapours existing in crowded towns the\r\nfollowing points deserve attention:—\r\n\r\n1. The conversion of blind alleys into thoroughfares.\r\n\r\n2. The continuation of leading streets through blocks of houses on which\r\nat present they abut.\r\n\r\n3. The opening of wide and straight streets through the meanest, most\r\ncomplex, and crowded parts of cities; this will prove the most important\r\nmeasure for meeting the object in view; and what merits the next\r\nconsideration is the preservation of such good and healthy avenues as\r\nalready exist free from encroachments: for it has happened in the\r\nmetropolis while exertions were making in some districts to open wide\r\nstreets, in other districts a contrary system was at work. The New and\r\nCity Roads, the most commodious avenue in the vicinity of London for\r\nlength, width, useful and healthy communication, is in a constant\r\nprocess of invasion, as may be noted more particularly in the vicinities\r\nof Tottenham-court Road and King’s-cross; and unless some measures are\r\ntaken to preserve this noble respiratory of the metropolis, it is to be\r\nfeared in a short time its character will be entirely changed.\r\n\r\n4. Another mode of improving the air of towns is to open squares, or\r\npublic walks, or gardens, by the removal of some of the buildings, by\r\nwhich means a reservoir of pure air is created, and in this manner the\r\ncity of Seville was essentially benefited; the streets are there\r\nnumerous, narrow, and dirty, but the city, abounding in large convents,\r\nthe removal of some of them, and the conversion of their ample sites\r\ninto piazzas or squares, afforded the air and space so much required for\r\nthe public health.\r\n\r\nIn London there are some institutions that might be advantageously\r\nremoved to the suburbs or skirts of the town, such as the Charter-house\r\nSchool and the Fleet Prison, and their sites converted into open\r\nsquares; but if such operations are too costly and difficult, we may at\r\nleast guard against the converse operation, viz., the covering of open\r\nsites with masses of buildings. Thus we have seen in recent times the\r\ngardens of Lincoln’s-inn and Gray’s-inn invaded; and we had lately a\r\nproposition to convert Lincoln’s-inn-square into piles of buildings, and\r\nto demolish what no art can supply, the finest reservoir of air which\r\nthe metropolis offers to a crowded neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n5. The circulation of pure air would be much increased by pulling down\r\nall dead walls, and by substituting iron railings in their stead; and\r\ntoo much credit cannot be given for what has already been effected in\r\nthis respect in the neighbourhood of Knightsbridge, &c.\r\n\r\n6. The prohibition of all burials in the metropolis and other large\r\ntowns, and the consequent diffusion of unwholesome effluvia.\r\n\r\n_Drainage and Sewerage._—As towns become more crowded, the value of good\r\ndrainage and sewerage as a sanitary measure becomes the more apparent;\r\nand as the means of draining the site of a town above and below the\r\nsurface is to be effected in part by the same means as the sewerage or\r\nremoval of the liquid filth, the subject becomes of great importance,\r\nand second only to the choice of the site of the town and distribution\r\nof its streets; and if a _due regard to system_ has been shown to be so\r\ndesirable in the one case, it is no less so in the other, and before any\r\nbuildings are commenced the plan of drainage should be matured.\r\n\r\nIn order to arrive at a good system of drainage for a piece of ground\r\nintended to be built upon, or in a town where the sewerage requires\r\nimprovement, a necessary step in the process would be to add to the plan\r\nof the town lines of equal altitudes, drawn at every two or three feet\r\nof elevation, which would present at one view the means of comparing the\r\nlevels over the whole extent of the town; they would show the deepest\r\nvalleys where the main sewers would most conveniently run, and the most\r\nefficient mode of combining the several classes of drains, so that the\r\ndeclivities might be turned to the best account; in addition, the plan\r\nshould be so far geological as to show the boundaries of the strata, as\r\na body of marl or clay often upholds a quantity of water which might\r\nprove injurious as a building site if not previously tapped.\r\n\r\nA notorious instance of this nature occurred at the village of Moseley,\r\nnear Birmingham. Preliminary to carrying the Gloucester Railway through\r\nthe village, in deep cutting, it had been ascertained by trial shafts\r\nthat the bottom consisted of quicksand, which rendered it difficult\r\neither to construct a tunnel or to support the slopes in open cutting\r\nuntil the water was removed; and for this object a drift or level was\r\nbrought up from a distance of a quarter of a mile through a bed of marl;\r\nthe miners proceeded for some distance perfectly dry until they reached\r\nthe quicksand, when the water flowed into the drift at the rate of 253\r\ncubic feet per hour, or 77½ gallons per minute, and the wells in the\r\nvillage in a short time were laid dry, and had to be deepened at the\r\nexpense of the Railway company. It so happened in this instance that the\r\nlevel of the quicksand was so deep that the surface of the land had not\r\nbeen affected by the pending up of the water below; but if it had been\r\notherwise, the measure resorted to would have proved as useful to the\r\nland as it was to the Railway.\r\n\r\nIn laying out a plan of drainage and sewerage when a river or brook\r\npasses through or alongside of a town, it will naturally become the main\r\ndrain of the place, and be the normal line from whence the second-class\r\nsewers would diverge; but it not unfrequently happens when such a brook\r\nis small and becomes the _cloaca maxima_, that, being left open, and\r\ninsufficiently supplied with water in the summer season, it constitutes,\r\ninstead of a benefit, a serious nuisance to the inhabitants; instances\r\nof this kind may be observed at Edinburgh, Birmingham, Coventry,\r\nCamberwell, &c., &c. It also happens at many towns that a stream passing\r\nthrough or by them is dammed up to turn a mill just above or below the\r\ntown, or even in the middle of it, by which means the current useful to\r\nclear away the filth is diverted, the water in the bed of the stream\r\ninto which sewers are discharged is left stagnant, while the vicinity of\r\nthe town is rendered wet and unwholesome from the pent up water.\r\n\r\nAt Birmingham the Rea Brook is dammed up in its course through the town\r\nto supply a mill. In the very excellent sanitary report of the town by\r\nDr. Hodgson and other medical gentlemen, it is stated that “the river\r\nRea may be considered the cloaca or main sewer of the town, but that its\r\ncondition is very bad;” the report also states, “that the stream is\r\nsluggish, and the quantity of water which it supplies is not sufficient\r\nto dilute and wash away the refuse which it receives in passing through\r\nthe town, and that in hot weather it is consequently very offensive; and\r\nin some situations in these seasons is covered with a thick scum of\r\ndecomposing matters; and this filthy condition of the river near the\r\nrailway stations is a subject of constant and merited animadversions,\r\nand that it requires especial attention lest it should become a source\r\nof disease, &c.”\r\n\r\nThe _cloaca maxima_ of Birmingham differs from that of ancient Rome;\r\nthat whereas in the latter art was employed to effect what nature had\r\nleft undone, here art has been employed to obstruct the useful course of\r\nnature. I quite agree with the sanitary report as to the present noxious\r\nstate of the brook; and even those who travel on the railway may at\r\ntimes be very sensible of the effluvia when crossing it.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to differ from the sanitary report as to insufficiency of\r\nthe water of the Rea for cleansing its own bed; but that report has not\r\nadverted to the fact of the abstraction and diversion of the water of\r\nthe Rea from its natural bed to turn a mill, a fact which will amply\r\naccount for the deficiency and sluggishness of the current in the very\r\nplaces where the contrary condition is most wanted.\r\n\r\nFrom my inspection of the locality, I am inclined to believe that the\r\ndescent of the Rea and its quantity of water in passing through the town\r\nof Birmingham is sufficient under good arrangements for the efficient\r\nand wholesome sewerage of its bed.\r\n\r\nIf we take a distance of half a mile above the weir and half a mile\r\nbelow it, that is, nearly from Morley-street to Lawley-street, I\r\nconsider I shall be justified in saying there is a descent of about 14\r\nfeet, for I find a slight weir in Floodgate-street; at the dam itself\r\nthe fall is about eight feet, and from thence for a considerable\r\ndistance downwards the fall is considerable.\r\n\r\nAbove the weir the stream for a short distance is sluggish from want of\r\ndeclivity, and the water being pent up, keeps the houses there wet or\r\ndamp, while below the weir the bed of the Rea being left nearly dry, the\r\nfilth from the sewers which discharge there must stagnate, while at the\r\nsame time the water of the Rea passing through the mill-race with a good\r\nbody and current, applies to no act of cleansing.\r\n\r\nThe mill-pool is extensive but shallow, and there the filth from above\r\naccumulates. When the pool is filled with water it is worked off by the\r\nmill, but the gratings prevent dead dogs and such like matter from\r\npassing, and are there left to fester at low water.\r\n\r\nThe remedy is as easy as the evil is great; all obstruction being\r\nremoved from the course of the brook and the water restored to its\r\noriginal bed, the object would be effected; as to the value of the\r\nmill-power which would thus be subverted, it cannot be a matter of much\r\namount in a place where coals and steam-engines are so cheap, and where\r\nthe constant and regular work of the mill must be an object of some\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nIn applying a remedy to the great evil under notice, the engineer should\r\nnot be content by merely restoring matters to their original and natural\r\nstate, but in so populous a town should apply all the aid which art can\r\nbestow to assist natural circumstances. The bed of the Rea should be\r\nformed with an uniform descent through the town and for some distance\r\nbelow it, by dredging in some places and filling it in others with\r\ncoarse gravel or broken stones; or, better still, if funds will afford\r\nit, by forming an inverted arch of stone or blue bricks to give full\r\neffect to the scour of the stream; further, the engineer would render\r\nthe course of the brook through the town as straight as circumstances\r\nwould permit by cutting off loops and sinuosities. In this manner, and\r\nby reserving the whole body of the water of the Rea for cleansing its\r\nown bed, I have no doubt that this main sewer of Birmingham would become\r\nas conspicuous for its wholesome and efficient action as it is now for\r\nthe contrary.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile above the town of Birmingham, there is another mill which I\r\nam disposed to think would act rather beneficially than otherwise, in\r\nremoving the filth from the bed of the brook in its course through the\r\ntown; for in summer weather when the stream is scanty, by pooling it up\r\nand letting the water down with force at intervals, the effect is much\r\nincreased. Whether the stream of the Rea be so deficient in summer as to\r\nrequire this process, I would not now give a positive opinion, but there\r\nare many somewhat analogous cases where the stream in summer is not\r\nsufficient and where the pooling up and flushing off at intervals could\r\nnot but prove of great utility; and if I have now brought the case of\r\nBirmingham into considerable detail, it is owing to the circumstance of\r\nits exemplifying certain conditions that are common to a great number of\r\ntowns, and which, in a sanitary point of view, and more especially in\r\nregard to the poorer classes of the community, are the most urgent for\r\nremedy of any that have fallen under my observation.\r\n\r\nIn the town of Haddington, a mill-dam crosses the river Tyne in its\r\npassage through the place and into the mill-pool; the main sewer is\r\ndischarged with a diminished and sluggish descent; and on occasion of\r\nfloods in the river, the water passes up the sewers and occasionally\r\nlays the lowest part of the town under water. It would not be difficult\r\nto direct the main sewer into the bed of the river below the dam or\r\nweir, and by the additional declivity give some current to the water of\r\nthe sewer, which from the pending up of the river at its present outlet\r\nhas rendered it almost stagnant, so much so, that in hot weather, and\r\nwhere it is not covered over, the exhalations are very offensive; but\r\nwas the sewer improved by the alteration mentioned, still the pooling up\r\nof the river for the mill keeps the lower part of the town damp, and\r\neven subjects it to partial inundations.\r\n\r\nOne of the medical officers reports, that when “fever has been at any\r\ntime prevalent in the town, it has been most so in a portion of it\r\ncalled the Nungate,[50] lying close by the river, when during the summer\r\nand autumn it is occasionally almost stagnant, and where there is a\r\nconsiderable decomposition of vegetable matter.”\r\n\r\nAnother medical gentleman, speaking of the main sewer, says, “this small\r\nburn is a receptacle of the privies and refuse of vegetable matters from\r\nthe houses near which it passes; and in those parts where it is\r\nuncovered, it forms an excellent index of the weather; previous to rain\r\nthe smell is intolerable.”\r\n\r\nThe same gentleman proposes as a remedy that another small burn, having\r\na parallel course at a short distance, should be turned into the sewer\r\nto aid the sewerage. From my knowledge of the locality, the\r\nrecommendation, I should say, is judicious, but in this manner, though\r\nthe supply of water would be increased, the declivity or rather want of\r\ndeclivity of the sewer would remain the same, and could only be improved\r\nby removing the mill-dam, or directing the sewer into the bed of the\r\nriver below it, as already mentioned. Unquestionably from the pending up\r\nof the river, the lower part of the town is at present very ill drained,\r\nand it is somewhat remarkable that it was the first site in Scotland\r\nvisited by the Asiatic cholera.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the two cases cited and to others of a similar nature,\r\nit should be remarked, that the vicinities of the nuisances are chiefly\r\ninhabited by the poorer classes, and who from want of influence in their\r\nown parts are the more necessarily thrown under the protection of state\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\nThe sewers of a city or town may be conveniently divided into four\r\nclasses:—First, the main drain or sewer, and this, whether natural or\r\nartificial, being fixed, becomes the basis of the system, and upon it\r\nthe second drains or district class will be directed: these again will\r\nreceive the third class or street drains; and lastly, the house or\r\nfourth class drains, will be discharged into the street drains. In small\r\ntowns, only the third and fourth class drains will be required; in large\r\ntowns, three classes of drains may be necessary; and in great cities,\r\nall the four classes will be required.\r\n\r\n                            PLAN OF SEWERAGE\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  STREET SEWERS (_o._ _p._)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DISTRICT SEWERS (_c._ _d._)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAIN SEWERS (A. B.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Fig. 1._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Fig. 2._\r\n]\r\n\r\nWith respect to the form of the drains, when bricks are used as building\r\nmaterials, the bottoms of the drains will be best formed of inverted\r\narches of blue bricks, as forming a cheap, hard, and durable surface,\r\nand giving every facility from the form, for the scouring force of the\r\nwater to remove the filth brought into the drain; but whether the curve\r\nof the bottom shall be a semicircle or a segment will, I apprehend,\r\ndepend on the size of the drain. For very small drains a circular form\r\nwould be the cheapest and best; the next size would be more\r\nadvantageously constructed of an oval or egg shape, but still of bricks.\r\nDrains of a still larger size, viz. the second class, may be\r\nconveniently made either of brick or stone, arched and counter-arched at\r\ntop and bottom with battered sides, either straight or curved; the\r\ncounter-arches or curved bottoms will conveniently become flatter as the\r\ndrains increase in capacity to afford greater room for the accumulated\r\nwater to pass without rising and flooding back into the feeders. The\r\nfirst and second-class sewers must be deep seated to receive their\r\nrespective tributaries or feeders, with some overfall; and though a\r\nsufficient width for large drains may generally be procured, it is\r\ndifficult in many cases to command enough of depth, another circumstance\r\nthat can best be obviated by flattening the arches both at top and\r\nbottom; but in large drains, where there is a body of water, the\r\nscourage will be sufficient, without resorting to deeply curved bottoms.\r\n\r\nWhen bricks abound as a building material, they are particularly\r\nconvenient for the construction of deep sewers and drains, from the\r\nfacility of handling in confined spaces; but it is important their\r\nquality should be of the best, since if they scale and decay, great\r\nexpense must be involved in the repair of the drain. The Tipton, or blue\r\nbrick, is the best for the facework of drains.\r\n\r\nIn parts of the country where stone abounds, bricks are often little\r\nknown, and the resources of the district must be made use of; where the\r\nblue lias limestone occurs, I have found it a cheap and excellent\r\nmaterial for forming culverts and drains of all sizes; and it was used\r\nlargely for that purpose on the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway.\r\n\r\nAnnexed is a sketch of the sections of drains varying in form according\r\nto their size. The batter which I found most useful and convenient for\r\nwall-sided drains was 1 in 9, either curved or straight; the first is\r\nthe best form in theory, but in small works I found the bricklayers’ and\r\nmasons’ work more accurately to the straight batter; and the last is,\r\nfrom its simplicity, better adapted to receive any sluices or\r\nflush-gates that may be necessary.\r\n\r\nAnnexed is also a sketch to show the distribution of drains in a town\r\nsupposed to be built on a regular plan, with a pretty uniform descent\r\ntowards an axis, which constitutes the site of the main drain; each\r\nclass of drains consisting of several sizes, it would be most useful as\r\nwell as economical that the drain of a particular class (if large)\r\nshould commence with the smaller size, and discharge or terminate with\r\nthe greater size, a plan that would aid the sewerage of the water.\r\n\r\nIn a system of drainage, it is necessary to consider that the greater\r\nthe body of water, or in other words, the class of the drain, the less\r\ndeclivity is sufficient; and the converse, the less the body of water,\r\nor class of drain, the greater declivity is required; in the first case,\r\nthe hydraulic depth compensates for the want of declivity; and in the\r\nsecond case, the declivity compensates for the want of hydraulic depth;\r\nthe multiplication of these qualities being a function of the velocity\r\nor force of the current, due attention to the above is important in\r\neconomizing or turning to the best account the declivity for the\r\ndrainage of a large town.\r\n\r\nHaving arranged the system of sewerage for a town, the next object will\r\nbe to render it as extensively useful as practice will admit of; and\r\nfrom the experiments and practice of Mr. Roe, the surveyor to the\r\nHolborn and Finsbury Commission of Sewers, we are warranted in the\r\nbelief that a good system of sewerage, aided by a sufficient supply of\r\nwater, will, in most localities, be sufficient to remove all the dirt\r\nwhich arises in the streets, without the necessity of cartage, and also\r\nall the filth of private dwellings which is at present led through\r\ndrains or pipes, or which by the aid of water may be practised more\r\nextensively in future.\r\n\r\nWe have first to consider the conveyance or discharge of the street dirt\r\ninto the main sewers, and the discontinuance of the present expense, and\r\nannoyance of using carts for that purpose, at least with some few\r\nexceptions.\r\n\r\nIt is pretty obvious, that if the mud of London, like water, could be\r\nmade to flow through the drains much trouble and expense of cartage\r\nwould be saved; and it does happen that the street-dirt of London is so\r\ndiffusible with water, that with a little arrangement such a mode of\r\ncleansing maybe followed; indeed it is highly probable that at present\r\nmore than one-half of the whole mud is carried off by the rains in that\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThe mud of London, and other great towns in England, may be assumed in\r\nwet weather[51] to arise, in three-fourths of its amount, from the\r\ngrinding or abrasion of the paving-stones, the remaining one-fourth part\r\nconsisting of soot, shop-sweepings, and cattle dung.\r\n\r\nThe dirt arising from the detritus of the stones may be obviated in two\r\nways; 1st, by substituting for the green-stone forming the carriage-way,\r\nquartz-rock, or quartzose stones. The green-stones contain hornblende\r\nand felspar, which grind, like all argillaceous stones, into fine mud or\r\npowder mixable in water, whereas quartz rock retains when ground the\r\nform of clean sand, neither soiling nor capable of forming mud in\r\nitself. The Lickey Hills in Worcestershire are composed of quartz rock,\r\nand the roads in their vicinity show its excellence as a material for\r\nroad making. The quartz rock, however, of the island of Jura is much\r\npurer, and that island contains an inexhaustible supply already broken\r\nby nature into sizes nearly fit for laying on the roads; and Small’s Bay\r\nin the island of Jura would form a convenient loading place, and by\r\nmeans of a jetty and tram-way vessels might be laden at a small expense,\r\nand much of the country supplied with the best of all materials for\r\nroad-making. The substance of the stone is hard and durable, and\r\nconsequently suffering little by abrasion; and it would be well worth\r\nwhile to try the experiment of Macadamizing one of the leading streets\r\nof London with this material, as the means of forming a good road, and\r\nat the same avoiding the creating of a great quantity of street dirt.\r\n\r\nThe other mode of avoiding the formation of mud is the substitution of\r\nwooden pavements; of the success of these I have little doubt, though\r\nfor the present many failures have occurred, either from The foundation\r\nnot having been truly and firmly laid, or from the blocks of wood not\r\nbeing massive enough. The greatest objection to wood pavements at\r\npresent is the slipping of the horses, but this I believe might be\r\nobviated.\r\n\r\nThe question, however, at present is to get rid of the street dirt, such\r\nas it is; and for that purpose I apprehend it would only be necessary in\r\nwet weather during rains that the street-cleaner should sweep the dirt\r\ninto the kennels, and aid the water by stirring the mud, to carry off\r\nthe material in a state of diffusion; in dry weather, the opening of\r\npipes with hose attached would serve the same purpose as the rains, and\r\nat the same time aid the sewerage at the time most required. After a\r\nshort but heavy fall of rain, the cleansing effect of the water is fully\r\nperceived: and if any means could be devised of saving the rain-water\r\nthat falls on the houses and in the streets, so as to apply it in\r\nconsiderable quantities at intervals, it is probable that the rain-water\r\nwould be amply sufficient for all the purposes in question.\r\n\r\nI have heard of the plan pursued by the West Middlesex Water Company for\r\ncleansing their reservoir at Kensington, at little expense, by diffusing\r\nthe muddy deposit in water, and allowing it to run off in pipes.\r\n\r\nIn the city of Guanaxuato in Mexico, a similar mode of cleansing has\r\nbeen long practised; a splendid tank of ample dimensions contains the\r\nwater used by the inhabitants; the tank is supplied by mountain\r\ntorrents, which bring down a considerable quantity of mud or silt, and\r\nwhich makes a deposit in the bottom of the tank, which is formed by a\r\nfine dam of masonry crossing a narrow valley, and provided with sluices.\r\nThe rainy season commences in the latter part of June, and a short time\r\nprevious the ceremony of emptying and cleansing the tank is gone\r\nthrough; a kind of fair and holiday is held on the ground, to which most\r\nof the inhabitants resort; the sluices are opened, and as the water\r\nrecedes, the watermen, boys, and all those who relish the fun, get into\r\nthe tank and keep stirring up the silt with sticks and spades, &c., and\r\nin this manner the mud is annually carried off by the remaining water of\r\nthe past season, a subsidiary tank serving for use until the principal\r\none is replenished.\r\n\r\nBy some sort of a similar process it is alleged that much of the\r\nmud-banks of the Thames above the bridges have been removed, viz., by\r\nthe action of the paddle-wheels of the numerous steam-boats running\r\nthere. Some of the effect observed must be owing to the greater scour of\r\nthe tides since the removal of Old London-bridge, though some part may\r\nalso be due to the steam-boats.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of giving more aid to the surface-water in cleansing the\r\nstreets, and at the same time for keeping the footways and houses drier\r\nand more free from mud, I should propose (at least as an experiment) a\r\ndifferent structure of the carriage-way, viz., to make it incline to a\r\ncentre kennel, instead of to two side ones. At present, in many places,\r\nthe centre of the carriage-way is elevated above the level of the shop\r\ndoors, and at the same time we often find the footway but three inches\r\nhigher than the kennel; and it is pretty obvious from this arrangement,\r\nin dry weather, the dust will blow from the more elevated carriage-way\r\non to the footways, and into the shops and areas; and in wet weather the\r\nwater and mud being chiefly accumulated in the side gutters, the\r\ncarriage wheels and horses’ feet will distribute it plentifully on the\r\nfootways, and not unfrequently on the passengers, and all tending to\r\nkeep the houses damp and dirty, whereas it is obvious that, was the\r\ndescent constant from the houses[52] on either side to the centre of the\r\nstreet, these evils would be avoided, and it will be no less evident\r\nthat all the surface-water flowing to one common channel would possess\r\nmore force and convenience for running the street dirt into the sewers.\r\nI am inclined to believe that the carriage-ways are getting gradually\r\nelevated above their proper level, from the contractors for paving not\r\nexcavating deep enough for the foundation of the pavement.\r\n\r\nAnnexed is a sketch, showing in juxta-position the form of the\r\nstreet-ways as at present, and as proposed to be; the street is supposed\r\nto be a shop-street, 90 feet wide, having two areas of three feet each,\r\ntwo footways of 12 feet, and 60 feet of carriage-way; on the section of\r\nthe proposed plan a fall of six inches, or 1 in 30, is given from the\r\nshop door to the edge of the pavement; there is then a descent by two\r\nsteps of six inches each to the carriage way; and lastly, a descent of 1\r\nin 30, or of one foot to the kennel in the centre of the carriage-way.\r\nThe kennel may either be open or covered; if the latter, it must have\r\nmany gratings. In the city of Mexico the kennel is chiefly in the centre\r\nof the street, and covered by large flat stones.\r\n\r\nOn the proposed plan, if we suppose a step from the foot pavement to the\r\nfloor of the shop or house, the latter will be elevated about 3 feet\r\nabove the gutter, whereas at present we often find it not more than six\r\ninches, and it will readily be admitted that such a difference in the\r\ndisposal of the surface-water cannot but keep the houses much drier and\r\nmore cleanly.\r\n\r\nBy having one gutter in the centre of the streets instead of two, (one\r\nat each side,) we remove two sluggish and inefficient kennels, which are\r\nthe source of damp to the pavement and to the houses, and we create one\r\nwhich is at a distance and doubly effective.\r\n\r\nThe subject of street pavements having been introduced as the means of\r\nsurface-drainage, it may be remarked how difficult it must ever be to\r\nkeep them in good order so long as they are liable to be broken up\r\nwhenever water or gas-pipes require altering or repairing, besides the\r\nextreme annoyance occasioned during that operation; and though it may\r\nnot be possible to obviate the inconvenience in all cases, yet I\r\nconceive the evil may be reduced to very narrow limits by resorting to\r\nsystem, and I would suggest that under the foot pavements passages\r\nshould be formed, lined with brick-work or masonry, as a common\r\nreceptacle for all the water and gas-pipes, having the flagging over the\r\npassage so laid as to be easily lifted in case of need, and being\r\nprovided at intervals with side entrances for inspection and all such\r\nrepairs as could be effected without raising the flagging. The position\r\nof the gas-pipes under the foot-pavement would be convenient for the\r\nstreet and shop lights, and the water-pipes would be then equally so for\r\nthe use of the houses. But in respect to the sewer of the street, I\r\nshould propose to place it near the centre of the carriage-way, as more\r\ndistant from the dwellings, but as equally convenient to both sides of\r\nthe street. (See the section for new form of carriage-way.)\r\n\r\nHaving noticed the subject of diminishing the amount of street mud, and\r\nof conveying the same into the sewers, as well as that portion of the\r\nhouse filth which it may be practicable to discharge into them, we have\r\nnext to notice the mode of further disposing of the matter thus lodged\r\nin the sewers. The practice has hitherto been (in a great degree) to\r\naccumulate the filth in cesspools, and at intervals of five to ten years\r\nto open the sewers by breaking into them, or to get access by man-holes\r\nleft for that purpose, and then drawing out the semiliquid contents of\r\nthe cesspool by means of a windlass and buckets; but in the Finsbury\r\ndivision the surveyor, Mr. Roe, has had the merit of introducing a very\r\nsuperior, less expensive, and less offensive mode of operation. Finding\r\nthat the surface-water did not generally enter the sewer in sufficient\r\nquantity and with sufficient force to carry off the more solid contents,\r\nhe contrived, by sluices or flush-gates, to dam up the water to a\r\ncertain height, and then, by opening the same, to obtain a force of\r\nwater sufficient for the purpose; and the working of this new plan is\r\nsaid to be highly satisfactory, the filth being prevented accumulating\r\nin the sewers, and, as a necessary consequence, then choaking their\r\nfeeders, the house drains; and in this manner also the filth is removed\r\nat less expense, and without any annoyance and noxious effluvia which\r\nattend the old practice.\r\n\r\nMr. Roe has adopted also side entrances to the sewers instead of\r\nman-holes, for the inspection and repair of the flushing apparatus. The\r\nchief expense beyond the first cost of Mr. Roe’s plan is the attendance\r\nof a person to open the flush-gates; but it is probable that some\r\ncontrivance may be found by which the pent-up water on reaching a\r\ncertain point may be able to open its own gate. It has, however,\r\noccurred to me, in respect to this mode of flushing off the filth, that,\r\ninstead of damming up the water in the sewers, and forming them into\r\nreservoirs, the purpose might be more easily and more effectually\r\nperformed by accumulating the surface-water from the gutters into\r\nreservoirs before entering the street or district drains; a greater\r\nhead, or force of water, might thus be obtained, while the sewers\r\nthemselves would always be open and free from the obstruction of the\r\nsluices and pent-up water.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the final deposit of the filth of London and other great\r\ntowns, it does seem a pity that so much valuable manure should be lost\r\nto the land, and be discharged into rivers to their contamination and\r\nobstruction, if any practicable and innocuous plan can be hit upon to\r\navoid the alternative.\r\n\r\nOne plan has been suggested of receiving the contents of the sewers into\r\npits, and then by means of steam-power and a sufficient supply of water,\r\nforcing the matter of the sewers in a diluted state through iron pipes\r\ninto the country, and then applying it to irrigate the land in the same\r\nliquid state. It would require much calculation to form an accurate\r\nestimate of the cost and profit of such an undertaking; but there can be\r\nno doubt if the matter was so applied it would prove exceedingly\r\nvaluable in enriching the land to which it was applied, as we may judge\r\nfrom what has occurred in the vicinity of Edinburgh from a similar kind\r\nof irrigation.\r\n\r\nAt Edinburgh, however, the liquid manure being conveyed from the town\r\nfor a distance in open ditches or sewers exposed to the sun and\r\natmosphere, it undergoes such a fœtid decomposition as to render the\r\noperation no common nuisance to the public. But such effects would not\r\noccur (at least, to the same extent) if the matter was conveyed in close\r\npipes with a plentiful effusion of water; and it is known that animal\r\ncarcases, when kept constantly exposed to fresh supplies of water, do\r\nnot suffer corrupt decomposition, but are changed into a fatty matter.\r\nIt seems necessary also that a certain degree of heat and exposure of\r\nsurface should be present to originate and promote fœtid decomposition,\r\nas it is well known that in the pits in Paris, where so many dead bodies\r\nwere thrown, the result was not a fœtid decomposition, but a change of\r\nthe animal matter into adipocire, a comparatively inoffensive substance;\r\nwe may therefore expect that the discharge of the contents of the sewers\r\nin pipes, excluded (as they would be) from heat, and copiously charged\r\nwith water, would be comparatively free from noxious exhalations.\r\n\r\nAnother plan of reserving the contents of sewers for the purpose of\r\nmanure would be to continue the sewers to some distance from the town,\r\nand then to discharge them into a series of covered catch-pits, allowing\r\nthe water to filter off after depositing the solid particles; when the\r\nfirst series of pits were deemed sufficiently charged, the sewers might\r\nthen be discharged into a subsidiary series, until the matter in the\r\nfirst had become sufficiently consistent for cartage. Upon the first\r\nplan of proceeding, the liquid manure could only be applied to land\r\nquite near at hand, and fit for irrigation; on the second plan the\r\nmanure might be conveyed to a distance and applied to arable land.\r\n\r\nIt will be evident the great importance of applying such quantities of\r\nmanure as the sewers supply to useful purposes, but it is no less\r\nevident that no system can be introduced to effect the object until\r\npreceded by satisfactory experiments of cost, profit, and efficiency.\r\nSome localities might offer facilities for one mode of action, and some\r\nfor another; and it is much to be desired that parties may be induced to\r\nmake experiments on both plans; and it is to be noted that though the\r\nexpense of raising the liquid manure from pits or tanks would be\r\nnecessary in some cases, yet in many situations no such operation would\r\nbe necessary.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of purifying the air of sewers, and of preventing the\r\nescape of foul air by any crevices or chinks, I have heard of the\r\ningenious contrivance of erecting a tall chimney and connecting it by a\r\npipe with the crown of a sewer, for the purpose of creating such a draft\r\nup the chimney as would occasion an indraft at any leak that might occur\r\nin the ramified mass of drains of the district to which the chimney\r\nbelonged. It appears to me that there are some objections to this plan;\r\nbut not being acquainted with all the details, I shall avoid entering\r\ninto any controversy on the subject, further than stating that I should\r\nrather propose an opposite process for purifying the air of sewers. I\r\nwould recommend that they should be kept excluded as much as possible\r\nfrom external heat and ascending columns of air; but at the same time I\r\nwould endeavour by all means to send down as copious a flow of water as\r\npracticable; and in London, though the Thames water may not be proper\r\nfor domestic purposes, it would be sufficiently pure for watering the\r\nstreets and cleansing the drains; and the supply being inexhaustible,\r\nits application would only be limited by the cost, of steam power and\r\niron pipes.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I have to express my obligations to yourself for the\r\nuseful hints you have afforded me on several of the subjects above\r\ntreated of, and to say I shall be happy if any of the observations I\r\nhave submitted should prove conducive to the ends in view.\r\n\r\n                                    I remain, dear Sir,\r\n                                                    Yours truly,\r\n                                                            JAMES VETCH.\r\n\r\n  _Edwin Chadwick, Esq.,\r\n      &c. &c. &c._\r\n    London, 1st March, 1842.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.—_Evidence of_ GEORGE GUTCH, Esq., _District Surveyor, on Shifting and\r\nBuilding of Inferior Tenements in the Suburbs to avoid the Provisions of\r\n                     the Metropolis Building Act_.\r\n\r\nIs there any distinction in the character of the buildings built out of\r\nthe limits of the Metropolitan Building Act, or out of the limits of\r\nyour own district as surveyor?—Yes; there is a less expensive\r\ndescription of buildings built out of these limits. In the adjoining\r\nparish of Kensington, there are tenements run up four stories in height\r\nwith only a nine-inch wall from the top to the bottom, whereas in any\r\nparish under the Building Act the walls of the same description of\r\nhouses would be required to be 18 inches thick in the basement and 14\r\ninches upwards: this, however, is not a sized house for the occupation\r\nof the poorer classes. At the Potteries, Notting Dale, Kensington,\r\nhowever, there is a nest of houses huddled together without party-walls\r\nand without drainage; many of them are built of wood and four-inch work,\r\nand of such materials as would not be permitted where the Building Act\r\nis in force. This is with reference to houses which are contiguous to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nHave you not seen instances where sewers are made and drains in action\r\nwhere the state of the premises is nevertheless dangerous?—Yes; only\r\nrecently the parochial officers of Paddington inspected the workhouses\r\nand buildings belonging to the Kensington union, when we found the\r\ndrains formed but not trapped, and the inmates exposed to the foul air\r\nfrom the drains themselves. I have read Mr. Oldfield’s statement, and I\r\nthink it very true and very important.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.—_Estimate by_ MR.

LOUDON’s _Agriculturist Model\r\n                               Cottage_.\r\n\r\nThe plan and elevation which I have given are intended for an\r\nAgricultural labourer in the north of England or in Scotland, where it\r\nis customary to have the sleeping room on the ground floor. The walls\r\nare supposed to be 18 inches thick, and the roof thatched, as being the\r\nwarmest covering in a cold bleak country. The front entrance is by a\r\nporch, which contains a step-ladder to the garrets, which, being lighted\r\nby windows in the gable ends, may be used as sleeping places for\r\ngrown-up children, while the younger children may sleep below in the\r\nsame room with their parents. _a_, is the kitchen; _b_, the sleeping\r\nroom; _c_, the back kitchen; _d_, the pantry; _e_, the dairy, if the\r\noccupant should have a cow, which is generally the case with\r\nagricultural labourers in Scotland; and _f_, a place for fuel, for\r\npoultry, or for a furnace to heat a flue passing under the floors of the\r\ntwo rooms in the direction of the dotted line _g_, the smoke escaping by\r\nthe upright flue _h_. The highest point of the sleeping-room floor is at\r\n_g_, and of the kitchen floor at _i_; the highest point of the pantry\r\nfloor is at _d_, and of the dairy floor at _e_, and from these four\r\npoints the floors gradually slope at the rate of 1 inch to 7 feet to the\r\nsill of the back kitchen door at _m_, so that no water can stand in any\r\npart of these floors; and hence, when they are being washed with a mop\r\nin the direction of the slope the water will readily flow towards the\r\nback door.\r\n\r\nA place for wood or other fuel, or for a pig or rabbits, according to\r\nthe taste or circumstances of the occupant, is shown at _n_; a privy at\r\n_o_; a tank for liquid manure, communicating with the privy, at _p_; and\r\na pit for ashes and solid manure at _q_. Both these pits may have\r\nmovable roofs.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the yard slopes from the entrance door _r_, to the liquid\r\nmanure tank _s_. The back kitchen is entered by one step; the terrace in\r\nfront at _t_ is entered by three steps, and the door of the porch by a\r\nhalf-step.\r\n\r\nThe garden is only partially shown, the portion omitted being a\r\nparallelogram of sufficient length to constitute the contents of the\r\nwhole ground allotted to the cottage, one-sixth of an acre. It is\r\nsurrounded by a hedge, which may be shown architecturally to give an\r\nappearance of design and taste on the part of the occupant.\r\n\r\nThe slope of the terrace may be covered with grass or flowers,\r\nstrawberries or ivy. The narrow border next the hedge may be planted\r\nwith flowers, and the larger compartments in front of the porch with\r\ngooseberries, raspberries, currants, and dwarf apples. The culinary\r\ncrops are supposed to be grown in the back compartment, only a portion\r\nof which is shown at _w_.\r\n\r\n_A B_, is the elevation of the front hedge.\r\n\r\n_C D_, a part of the side hedge.\r\n\r\n_E F_, a section on the dotted line _E F_, to a double scale.\r\n\r\n_G H_, a section on the dotted line _G H_.\r\n\r\nThe upper part of the drawing is an isometrical view.\r\n\r\n\r\n   9.—_Statement of the Requisites of Cottage Architecture, by_ J. C.\r\n                             LOUDON, _Esq._\r\n\r\nThe _essential requisites_ of a comfortable labourer’s cottage may be\r\nthus summed up:—\r\n\r\n1. The cottage should be placed alongside a public road, as being more\r\ncheerful than a solitary situation; and in order that the cottager may\r\nenjoy the applause of the public when he has his garden in good order\r\nand keeping.\r\n\r\n2. The cottage should be so placed that the sun may shine on every side\r\nof it every day throughout the year, when he is visible. For this\r\nreason, the front of the cottage can only be parallel to the public road\r\nin the case of roads in the direction of north-east, south-west,\r\nnorth-west, and south-east; in all other cases the front must be placed\r\nobliquely to the road, which, as we have previously shown, is greatly\r\npreferable to having the front parallel to the road.\r\n\r\n3. Every cottage ought to have the floor elevated, that it may be dry;\r\nthe walls double or hollow, or battened, or not less than eighteen\r\ninches thick, that they may retain heat; with a course of slate or\r\nflagstone, or tiles bedded in cement, six inches above the surface, to\r\nprevent the rising of damp; the roof thick, or double, for the sake of\r\nwarmth; and projecting eighteen inches or two feet at the eaves, in\r\norder to keep the walls dry, and to check the radiation of heat from\r\ntheir exterior surface.\r\n\r\n4. In general, every cottage ought to be two stories high, so that the\r\nsleeping-rooms may not be on the ground floor; and the ground floor\r\nought to be from six inches to one foot above the outer surface.\r\n\r\n5. The minimum of accommodation ought to be a kitchen or living-room, a\r\nback kitchen or wash-house, and a pantry, on the ground floor, with\r\nthree bed-rooms over; or two rooms and a wash-house on the ground floor,\r\nand two bed-rooms over.\r\n\r\n6. Every cottage, including its garden, yard, &c., ought to occupy not\r\nless than one-sixth of an acre; and the garden ought to surround the\r\ncottage, or at all events to extend both before and behind. In general,\r\nthere ought to be a front garden and a back yard, the latter being\r\nentered from the back kitchen, and containing a privy, liquid-manure\r\ntank, place for dust and ashes, and place for fuel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n7. If practicable, every cottage ought to stand singly, and surrounded\r\nby its garden, or, at all events, not more than two cottages ought to be\r\njoined together. Among other important arguments in favour of this\r\narrangement, it may be mentioned, that it is the only one by which the\r\nsun can shine every day on every side of the cottage. When cottages are\r\njoined together in a row, unless that row is in a diagonal direction,\r\nwith reference to a south and north line, the sun will shine chiefly on\r\none side. By having cottages singly or in pairs, they may always be\r\nplaced along any road in such a manner that the sun may shine on every\r\nside of them, provided the point be given up of having the front\r\nparallel to the road; a point which, in our opinion, ought not for a\r\nmoment to be put in competition with the advantages of an equal\r\ndiffusion of sunshine.\r\n\r\n8. Every cottage ought to have an entrance-porch for containing the\r\nlabourer’s tools, and into which, if possible, the stairs ought to open,\r\nin order that the bed-rooms may be communicated with without passing\r\nthrough the front or back kitchen. This, in the case of sickness, is\r\nvery desirable, and also in the case of deaths, as the remains may be\r\ncarried down stairs while the family are in the front room.\r\n\r\n9. The door to the front kitchen or best room should open from the\r\nporch, and not from the back kitchen, which, as it contains the cooking\r\nutensils and washing apparatus, can never be fit for being passed\r\nthrough by a stranger, or even the master of the family, where proper\r\nregard is had by the mistress to cleanliness and delicacy.\r\n\r\n10. When there is not a supply of clear water from a spring adjoining\r\nthe cottage, or from some other efficient source, then there ought to be\r\na well or tank, partly under the floor of the back kitchen, supplied\r\nfrom the roof, with a pump in the back kitchen for drawing it up for\r\nuse, as hereafter described in detail. The advantages of having the tank\r\nor well under the back kitchen are, that it will secure from frost, and\r\nthat the labour of carrying water will be avoided.\r\n\r\n11. The privy should always be separated from the dwelling, unless it is\r\na proper water-closet, with a soil-pipe communicating with a distant\r\nliquid-manure tank or cesspool. When detached, the privy should be over\r\nor adjoining a liquid-manure tank, in which a straight tube from the\r\nbottom of the basin ought to terminate; by which means the soil basin\r\nmay always be kept clean by pouring down the common slops of the house.\r\nNo surface being left from which smell can arise, except that of the\r\narea of the pipe, the double flap, to be hereafter described, will\r\nprevent the escape of the evaporation from this small surface, and also\r\nensure a dry and clean seat.\r\n\r\n12. The situation of the liquid-manure tank should be, as far as\r\npossible, from that of the filtered-water tank or clear-water well. It\r\nshould be covered by an air-tight cover of flagstone, and have a narrow\r\nwell adjoining, into which the liquid should filter through a grating,\r\nso as to be pumped up or taken away without grosser impurities, and in\r\nthis state applied to the soil about growing crops.\r\n\r\n13. In general, proprietors ought not to entrust the erection of\r\nlabourers’ cottages on their estates to the farmers, as it is chiefly\r\nowing to this practice that so many wretched hovels exist in the\r\nbest-cultivated districts of Scotland and in Northumberland.\r\n\r\n14. No landed proprietor, as we think, ought to charge more for the land\r\non which cottages are built than he would receive for it from a farmer,\r\nif let as part of a farm; and no more rent ought to be charged for the\r\ncost of building the cottage and enclosing the garden than the same sum\r\nwould yield if invested in land, or, at all events, not more than can be\r\nobtained by government securities.\r\n\r\n15. “Most of these conditions are laid down on the supposition that the\r\nintended builder of the cottage is actuated more by feelings of human\r\nsympathy than by a desire to make money; and hence they are addressed to\r\nthe wealthy, and especially to the proprietors of land and extensive\r\nmanufactories or mines.”\r\n\r\nThe following is the view of a double mechanic’s cottage, from Mr.\r\nLoudon’s collection, similar to the agricultural labourer’s model\r\ncottage, of which a view has already been given.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBesides the details of construction, such as are exemplified in the\r\nreport, that appear deserving of attention, there are details in the\r\nfurniture of cottages, and particular descriptions of furniture by which\r\nit appears that much improvement may be effected. For example, an\r\nimportant improvement in the box bedsteads used in Scotch cottages has\r\nbeen suggested by Dr. Wilson, of Kelso. It consists of a curtain-rod and\r\ncurtains, which may be drawn out about three feet from the front of the\r\nbed, so as to form sufficient space between the curtain and the bed to\r\nserve as a dressing-room. It is observed by Mr. Loudon, that some of the\r\nLeith and London steamers had the berths in the ladies’ cabins fitted up\r\nin this mode some years ago; and it is a principle applicable, and, it\r\nis unnecessary to say. necessary for the preservation of decency in\r\ndouble-bedded rooms, as well as in those cottages where the box bedstead\r\nis used. The following is a copy of the plan of the improvement given by\r\nMr. Loudon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2309]\r\n\r\nAnother part of Dr. Wilson’s improvements in these beds consists of the\r\nhinging a part of the roof of the bed, so that it may be opened like a\r\ntrap-door at pleasure for ventilation, and the hinging of the boards at\r\nthe foot and at the back for the same object, and for giving access to a\r\nmedical attendant. Mr. Loudon expresses a hope that these improvements\r\nform one step to getting rid of box bedsteads altogether. They are\r\nnoticed here as exemplifications of the moral ends which may be gained\r\nin structural arrangements, which incur inconsiderable expense, and only\r\na little care at the outset. Other detailed improvements may be made\r\nsubservient to structural economy. The following is an exemplification\r\nthus described by Mr. Loudon:—“It is a matter of some difficulty, in\r\nsmall cottages, to place the shutters to the windows on the ground floor\r\nin such a manner as to answer the purpose, and yet be out of the way.\r\nThe following plan has been adopted in some buildings of that\r\ndescription, which have been lately erected. The shutters are hung on\r\nhinges in such a manner as to fall down into a recess below the window\r\nduring the day-time; and consequently they are quite out of the way when\r\nnot wanted for shutting up the house, or for temporary purposes. The\r\nidea suggested itself that shutters be occasionally used as a table or\r\nironing-board; and to effect this end, two movable bars as supports were\r\nlet into mortices in the floor, and made to abut against similar\r\nmortices made in the ledges on the under side of the shutters. The two\r\ncornices were slightly rounded, and the upper surface was left plain\r\nwithout paint.

THOMAS WHATELEY, _Cookham, Berks, on\r\n       Cottage Allotments, and the keeping of Pigs by Cottagers_.\r\n\r\nIt appears that a great part of the land of your parish is common, and\r\nthat a portion of the population borders upon the common. What is the\r\nstate of that population as compared with that which is too far removed\r\nfrom the commons to enjoy any of their privileges?—The persons who live\r\nin the immediate neighbourhood of the commons are evidently much poorer\r\nthan those who live at a distance.\r\n\r\nTo what do you attribute this?—I attribute it to their depending upon a\r\nprecarious and uncertain income; and I am sure, from all the observation\r\nI have been able to make, that a poor man’s best subsistence will always\r\ndepend upon constant work and good wages, and that he never works for so\r\nbad a master as when he works for himself. And all employments, such as\r\nattending sheep, geese, &c., besides the precarious nature of the return\r\nmade by them, usually impair his habits of steady and patient industry,\r\nand frequently give him a turn for poaching and pilfering, and engender\r\nother irregular and demoralizing habits.\r\n\r\nBut may not the children of the cottager, while he is engaged in steady\r\nand patient industry, be usefully and profitably employed in taking care\r\nof a pig or geese on the common?—No. The reason which applies against\r\nthe father doing so, namely, the bad desultory habits engendered,\r\napplies with greater force against the children doing so. If they are\r\nold enough to be able to attend to these things, they are usually old\r\nenough to be employed in some rural occupation for which wages would be\r\nearned. Many mistakes are prevalent with respect to the profits from\r\nkeeping cows, sheep, geese, pigs, &c., for I do not believe that any of\r\nthese are really profitable; and though I am glad to see a pig as an\r\nappendage to a cottage (if the cottager’s employer has no reason to be\r\nsorry), because the pig serves as a sort of savings bank to the\r\nlabourer; for if the labourer had not the animal, he would not put by,\r\nand out of his reach, from day to day, the money which the pig costs him\r\nin fatting; yet it is notorious that a labouring man pays more dearly\r\nfor his bacon than he would do if he purchased it ready prepared to his\r\nhand.[54] Nor would he be the better clothed or cheaper shod if he took\r\nthe operation of the Manchester weaver or the Nottingham shoemaker into\r\nhis own hands.\r\n\r\nBut may not a labourer attend to the management of pigs or cows after\r\nthe hours of work?—I think not, because a good labourer usually works by\r\nthe great, and has done as much as his strength will allow when he\r\nreturns home; and because nothing is gained by feeding cattle upon\r\ncommons, where the cattle have nothing else to depend upon. The very\r\nworst master a poor man can work for is himself.\r\n\r\nYou say that the reason which applies against the father attending to\r\npigs, geese, &c., on commons, applies equally against the children being\r\nso, _i. e._, the idle habits engendered; and that if they are old enough\r\nto be able to attend to these things, they are usually old enough to be\r\nemployed in some rural occupation, for which wages would be earned. Now\r\nwould not the children be employed by farmers in the same sort of\r\nlabour, namely, in looking after cattle; and if so, why is it that the\r\ncare of cattle on the common for the other is worse or more demoralizing\r\nthan the care of the same sort of things for the farmer?—I conceive that\r\nI have answered this question before. If a farmer sends his pigs or\r\nother cattle into open fields or commons, and requires the assistance of\r\na child to watch them, they are turned out only for a change, but are\r\nnever in this part of the country kept upon the commons.\r\n\r\nDo you think allotments of land to the labourer beneficial; and if so,\r\nwhat quantity may be usefully occupied by him?—I do not think allotments\r\nof land to the poor beneficial. I had rather see the allotments gathered\r\ninto one large one, a farm, and the labouring man employed at good\r\nwages, by a superintendent managing the whole at his own risk and for\r\nhis own interest, in the share to which his undivided and greater\r\nattention and anxiety justly entitle him, that is, by a thriving farmer.\r\nThe poor man must be a poor master, and he had better serve a rich one.\r\n\r\nWhat do you believe would be the consequence of too large allotments of\r\nland being made to the labourers?—That the poor man could not cultivate\r\nit. The wealth of his employer is the poor man’s safeguard against want.\r\nI approve of the practice of a benevolent farmer in my parish, who is\r\naccustomed to give to his labourers a headland of his field as a bonus\r\nto industry. He says he will make it worth the while of his labourers to\r\nbe honest and diligent towards him, by letting them feel that they will\r\nhave a suitable return from him. If what are called “ample allotments”\r\nare given, it appears to me to be a sort of wholesale almsgiving,\r\nattended with more than the usual mischiefs attendant upon most\r\nalmsgiving. The orchard and garden before me might, if cut up into\r\nallotments, serve for six families of young labourers. It may be all\r\nvery well to say, “Take these, my good men, and be happy;” but when, in\r\nthe progress of population, there arises four times six families to be\r\nfed from the same soil, where will then be the happiness of the\r\nallotments? What, I submit, are small farms but ample allotments, and\r\nwhat, when stripped of romance, is found by experience to be the\r\nsuperior condition and power of production of the small farmers? Are\r\nthey not, even where they farm their own lands, almost universally\r\nfailing (like the small manufacturers against the large ones) in\r\ncompetition before the more scientific management, economy of labour,\r\nand more powerful application of capital of the large farmer. What is\r\nall Ireland but a country of cottage allotments; and what is there in\r\nthat theatre of disorder and wretchedness that should induce the\r\nbenevolent (or those who may have in their eyes the immediate temptation\r\nof _Irish rents_) to make trial of any such system in England? Are the\r\ncottiers who possess the fee-simple, the small freeholders of Ireland,\r\nin a superior condition by virtue of their allotments?—Many of the\r\npromoters of allotments doubtless intend well, and act upon the evidence\r\nof immediate benefits and satisfaction derived from them; so, probably,\r\ndid the original promoters of the bread-money, scales, and the allowance\r\nsystem, labour rates, and the train of corrupting palliatives?\r\n\r\nHave you had an opportunity of observing experiments in what is termed\r\nspade husbandry?—I have never seen spade husbandry; but I should wish to\r\nsee it universally adopted, if the adoption of it would add wealth to\r\nthe farmer, for in that case it could not fail to benefit the labourer.\r\n\r\nIt is said that farmers ought to take the single agricultural labourers\r\ninto their houses, and preside at the labourers’ tables as formerly;\r\nwhat is your opinion as to the practicability of recurring to the old\r\nsystem?—Those who say so are very ill formed upon the subject. Farmers,\r\nwho were (in manners, wealth, and education) but very little better than\r\ntheir own labourers, might formerly, with comfort to themselves and\r\nadvantage to their men, receive their carters into their family, and\r\ndine at their table with them; but the habits of those times are gone\r\nfor ever.\r\n\r\nDo you think the enclosures of such parishes as Cookham beneficial to\r\nthe poor?—Yes I do, inasmuch as they extend the demand for the poor\r\nman’s only marketable commodity—his labour.\r\n\r\n[Every position stated in this examination with relation to the\r\npractical operation of the theory of small farm allotments, and of the\r\npig and cow theories, was corroborated by a large mass of evidence from\r\nevery part of the country, where they had been, for any length of time,\r\nin operation.—E. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  13.—_Arrangement of Public Walks in Towns; Plan of the Arboretum at\r\n                Derby, laid out by_ J. C. LOUDON, _Esq._\r\n\r\nWhen it appeared that a general botanic garden would be too expensive,\r\nboth to create and to keep up; that a mere composition of trees and\r\nshrubs with turf, in the manner of a common pleasure-ground, would\r\nbecome insipid after being seen two or three times; and, in short, that\r\nthe most suitable kind of public garden, for all the circumstances\r\nincluded in the above data, was an arboretum, or collection of trees and\r\nshrubs, foreign and indigenous, which would endure the open air in the\r\nclimate of Derby, with the names placed to each. Such a collection will\r\nhave all the ordinary beauties of a pleasure-ground viewed as a whole;\r\nand yet, from no tree or shrub occurring twice in the whole collection,\r\nand from the name of every tree and shrub being placed against it, an\r\ninducement is held out for those who walk in the garden to take an\r\ninterest in the name and history of each species, its uses in this\r\ncountry or in other countries, its appearance at different seasons of\r\nthe year, and the various associations connected with it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF THE DERBY ARBORETUM, 1840.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA similar interest might no doubt have been created by a collection of\r\nherbaceous plants; but this collection, to be effective in such a space\r\nof ground, must have amounted to at least 5000 species; and to form such\r\na collection, and keep it up, would have been much more expensive than\r\nforming the most complete collection of trees and shrubs that can at\r\npresent be made in Britain. It is further to be observed respecting a\r\ncollection of herbaceous plants, that it would have presented no beauty\r\nor interest whatever during the winter season; whereas, among trees and\r\nshrubs, there are all the evergreen kinds, which are more beautiful in\r\nwinter than in summer; while the deciduous kinds, at that season, show\r\nan endless variety in the ramification of their branches and spray, the\r\ncolour of their bark, and the colour and form of their buds. Add also,\r\nthat trees and shrubs, and especially evergreens, give shelter and\r\nencouragement to singing-birds, to which herbaceous plants offer little\r\nor no shelter or food.\r\n\r\nThere are yet other arguments in favour of trees and shrubs for a garden\r\nof recreation, which are worth notice. Herbaceous plants are low, small,\r\nand to have any effect must be numerous; while to acquire their names,\r\nand look into their beauties, persons walking in the garden must stand\r\nstill, and stoop down, which, when repeated several times, would soon,\r\ninstead of a recreation, become very fatiguing. Now trees and shrubs are\r\nlarge objects, and there is scarcely one of them the beauty of which may\r\nnot be seen and enjoyed by the spectator while he is walking past it,\r\nand without standing still at all.\r\n\r\nA glance at the plan, _fig. 2_, in p. 6, will show that I have provided\r\nas great an extent of gravel-walk as the space would admit of; the total\r\nlength, including the walk round the flower-garden, exceeding a mile.\r\nThere is a straight broad walk in the centre, as a main feature from the\r\nprincipal entrance; an intersecting broad and straight walk to form a\r\ncentre to the garden, and to constitute a point of radiation to all the\r\nother walks; and there is a winding walk surrounding the whole. As a\r\nstraight walk without a terminating object is felt to be deficient in\r\nmeaning, a statute on a pedestal is proposed for the radiating centre\r\n_i._ in _fig. 2_; a pedestal with a vase, urn, or other object, for the\r\nsecond circle in the straight walk, _fig. 2_, _k_; while the pavilions\r\n_fig. 3_, form terminating objects to the broad cross walk.\r\n\r\nAs a terminal object gives meaning to a straight walk leading to it, so\r\nit is only by creating artificial obstructions that meaning can be given\r\nto a winding walk over a flat surface. These obstructions may either be\r\ninequalities in the ground, or the occurrence of trees or shrubs in the\r\nline which the walk would otherwise have taken, so as to force it to\r\nbend out of that line. Both these resources have been employed in laying\r\ndown the direction of the surrounding walk, though its deviation from a\r\nstraight line has chiefly been made in conformity with the varying\r\nposition of the trees in the belt already existing. This belt, and also\r\nthe trees in the flower-garden, and in other parts of the plan, which\r\nwere there previously to commencing operations, and which are left\r\nconformably to Mr. Strutt’s instructions, are shown in the plan, _fig.\r\n4_, p. 75. The point of junction of one walk with another is always\r\nnoticeable in an artistical point of view, and affords an excuse for\r\nputting down sculptural or other ornamental objects at these points.\r\n\r\n\r\n    14.—_Boards of Health:—Report on the labours of the “Conseil de\r\n      Salubrité” of Paris, from 1829 to 1839._ _By_ M. TREBUCHET.\r\n\r\nBefore the revolution of 1789, M. Lenoir, one of the last lieutenants of\r\npolice of that period, and one of those who most particularly occupied\r\nthemselves with the health of the city of Paris, consulted on questions\r\nof health and salubrity two men, _Pia_ and _Cadet de Vaux_, both of them\r\napothecaries; the last had the title of inspector-general: it was to him\r\nthat all matters of health were habitually referred. Later, on the\r\ninstitution of the prefect of police, in whose hands was vested all that\r\nrelated to salubrity and the public health, this magistrate consulted\r\nsometimes a physician, sometimes a chemist, sometimes a veterinary\r\nsurgeon, according to the nature of the case upon which he had to\r\ndetermine.\r\n\r\nThis state of things presented inconveniences so much the more serious\r\nthat the number of affairs increasing every day, demanded more unity in\r\nthe reports, and more activity in the labours. It was then that the\r\nnecessity was felt of establishing a permanent council. Such was the\r\norigin of the “Conseil de Salubrité,” instituted by the prefect of\r\npolice, Dubois, the 6th of July, 1802. It was composed of four\r\nmembers,—Deyeux, Parmentier, Huzard, senior, and Cadet-Gassicourt. In\r\n1803, M. Thouret was called to the council; afterwards, in 1807, Leroux\r\nand Dupuytren; in 1810, M. Pariset replaced M. Thouret, and it was at\r\nthe same period that the nomination of Doctor Petit took place. From\r\nthat time the men of the greatest consideration sought to have a part in\r\nthe labours of the “Conseil de Salubrité.” Thus we see enter\r\nsuccessively M. d’Arcet in 1813; M. Marc in 1815; M. Berard in 1817; the\r\nengineer Girard, and Huzard, junior, in 1819; Pelletier and Juge in\r\n1821; M. Gautier de Claubry and M. Parent Duchâtelet in 1825; MM.\r\nAdelon, Andral, junior, Barruel, and Labarraque, in 1828; Doctor\r\nEsquirol in 1829. The greater part of these men no longer exist. Deyeux,\r\nParmentier, Huzard, senior, Cadet-Gassicourt, Thouret. Leroux,\r\nDupuytren, Marc, Girard, Parent-Duchâtelet, Barruel, Esquirol, are no\r\nlonger there to direct the labours of the council, to contribute their\r\nlong experience and indefatigable activity; but their labours remain to\r\nus, and we can at least draw from them useful instructions, and still\r\nenlighten ourselves by their valuable opinions.\r\n\r\nThus, and with the view to preserve these precious traditions, which\r\nmaintain in the council an unity of design so remarkable, the\r\nadministration decided from the commencement that their general reports\r\nshould be printed.\r\n\r\nThis publication, which stopped in 1828, and of which the continuance\r\nwas greatly desired, has just been resumed by the orders of M. Gabriel\r\nDelessert, prefect of police.\r\n\r\nThis collection, which is of such general interest, embraces therefore a\r\nperiod of nearly forty years.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we are to congratulate ourselves on the delay which has taken\r\nplace in the publication of these reports. In going over these ten years\r\nit becomes more easy to follow the council in the progressive march of\r\ntheir labours, to perceive that they were all based upon a uniform and\r\nconstant jurisprudence; that they had no other end than the preservation\r\nof the public health, the well-devised interest of property and\r\nindustry. On this account we have always thought that besides the annual\r\nreports, extremely useful in other respects, but confined within too\r\nnarrow a circle, it would be well to publish every ten years a summary,\r\nwhich, retracing what had been done in that long period, should offer a\r\nwide field of study both to governors and governed.\r\n\r\nSince 1829 the reports addressed to the administration, on the numerous\r\nquestions which it submitted to the council, amount to 4431. But that of\r\nwhich there remains no trace are the experiments, often even the\r\npreliminary reports, the trips, and sometimes the journeys, which each\r\nof these reports rendered necessary; labours of which the report is only\r\na summary, and which impart such great authority to the decisions of the\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\nThese decisions relate to three great divisions,—_health_, _salubrity_,\r\nand _industry_. Under _health_ are classed, among other things, the\r\nresearches on the adulteration of food, on the vessels used in its\r\npreparation, on the precautions to be taken with respect to the vessels\r\nand utensils of copper, regard being had to the uses for which they are\r\nemployed; the experiments on the adulteration of salts, on the\r\nadulteration of bread and of flour by different substances, on the\r\npoisonous substances employed to colour bonbons, liqueurs, &c.; the\r\nexamination of the methods employed in preparing pork; the examination\r\nof the water used for drink; the adulteration of the flours of linseed\r\nand mustard; the use of meat of animals who had died of disease; the\r\nresearches into the salubrity of dwellings. The head of _salubrity_\r\ncomprises the anatomical theatres, their construction, the means of\r\nremedying the causes of the unhealthiness which these establishments\r\npresent; the discharge of sulphurous waters from the public baths, the\r\nutility of street fountains, the inspection of barracks, and the\r\nsanitary measures to which they should be subject; the improvements to\r\nbe made in the fires of the establishments which employ coals; the\r\narrangements to be made for the deposit of filth in the rural districts;\r\nthe purification of sewers; the supply of water for domestic and\r\nindustrial purposes; the steps to be taken in exhumations; the\r\nexamination of different contrivances to empty privies, the\r\nameliorations to be introduced into this portion of service; the\r\nwholesomeness of the markets, the inspection of prisons. The reports\r\nwhich relate to _industry_ principally treat of the construction of\r\nslaughter-houses; the condensation of the gas and vapours resulting from\r\nthe refining of metals; the fabrication, preservation, and sale of\r\nfulminating and lucifer matches; the precautions to be taken in the\r\nconstruction of fulminating powder-mills, and in the manipulation of the\r\nsubstances employed there; the measures to be taken for the conveyance\r\nof the fulminate of mercury; the researches into the employment of\r\nbitumens, and the conditions to be prescribed to the makers; the making\r\nwax-candles; the conditions to be imposed on cat-gut factories; the\r\nresearches on the fires of wash-houses, and on the necessity of\r\ndecomposing the soapy water to prevent putrefaction; the sanitary\r\nmeasures applicable to white lead manufactories, and the researches on\r\nthe diseases of the workmen; the propositions of classification for\r\ndifferent trades, such as the silk-hat factories, the forges, the places\r\nfor making and keeping ether; and the beating of carpets.\r\n\r\nThus health, salubrity, industry, offer to the “Conseil de Salubrité” a\r\nvast field of researches and investigations, and we may affirm that\r\nthere is no question relating to these three great departments of the\r\nadministration which they have not profoundly meditated, and in part\r\nresolved. If now we turn to other subjects we still find important\r\nlabours which touch in several points on the different matters of which\r\nwe have just spoken, but which have not, like them, a special and\r\nclearly-defined character: such are the reports on epidemics and\r\nsmall-pox; the measures to be taken to prevent or combat them; the\r\n_epizooties_ that have prevailed at different epochs among several\r\nspecies of animals, and particularly among milking-cows; the sale of\r\nhorses with glanders, and the regulations to which they should be\r\nsubject, as well as other animals seized with contagious diseases; the\r\nmeasures to be taken against mad dogs, and the precautions in case of\r\nbites from these animals; the modelling, examination, and embalming of\r\ncorpses; the aids to be afforded to the drowned and suffocated; the\r\nmeasures to be taken to ascertain the number of these accidents as well\r\nas of suicides; the compilation of a new nosographic table of the\r\ndiseases which cause death; the measures to be taken to prevent fires in\r\ntheatres, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nSuch is a general view of the subjects upon which the council has been\r\ncalled to give their opinions. It now remains to describe the\r\ncircumstances which demanded them, and the results they have produced.\r\n\r\nOne of the objects which more especially engaged the care of the council\r\nwas that of bread. It is the thing, it is true, which most directly\r\ninterests the people. The quality of bread may be deteriorated by\r\nvarious ingredients, but no one could have foreseen that noxious\r\nsubstances would be employed with the view, ostensibly at least, of\r\nimproving it. Nevertheless the correctional tribunal of Brussels was\r\ncalled upon some years since to try some bakers brought before it under\r\na charge of selling bread adulterated with noxious substances. On the\r\noccasion of this trial the prefect of police inquired of the council if,\r\nas these bakers alleged in their defence, a small quantity of a\r\nsubstance which they called _blue_ alum, put into the yeast, had the\r\nproperty of rendering the bread whiter and less heavy.\r\n\r\nIn order to give their opinion, the council first examined what was the\r\nsubstance called by the name of _blue_ alum. Some designate by this name\r\nthe sulphate of copper, but most people mean by blue alum the rock alum,\r\n(sulphate of alumina and potass,) because this salt in the lump has a\r\nbluish tinge, and, as with all the sulphates, the sulphate of which the\r\nbase is alumina is the only one which bears the name of alum, it is to\r\nbe presumed that it is this salt, or rock alum, which goes under the\r\nname of _blue alum_, and not the sulphate of copper which is known in\r\ncommerce by the name of _blue vitriol_.\r\n\r\nIt had been long known that alum, by the action of heat equal to that of\r\na baker’s oven, swells, increases in volume, and becomes a porous mass,\r\nlight and very white, which is no longer alum, but a mixture of a great\r\ndeal of insoluble sub-sulphate with a small quantity of alum, a\r\nsubstance astringent, and not poisonous. It is probable that this\r\nproperty, known to some bakers, determined them to add to bread made of\r\ncertain flour a little of this alum, which, without being injurious to\r\nthe health, really made the bread whiter, at the same time that the\r\ncrust became brown at a less heat.\r\n\r\nAs to the employment of sulphate of copper (blue vitriol), it is only by\r\na gross error that it could be supposed capable of making bread white.\r\nNevertheless a baker of the town of Gand was prosecuted for putting this\r\npoisonous salt into his bread. The commission appointed to examine the\r\nbread not having been able to discover any trace of copper, mixed a\r\nkilogram of flour, to which was added twenty-four grains of sulphate of\r\ncopper, and they affirmed that it was impossible to detect in the bread\r\nthe least trace of the salt they had introduced.\r\n\r\nAfter such an assertion it became interesting to make some researches on\r\nthe subject. In consequence, the delegates of the council who were\r\nentrusted with the inquiry, had four loaves of a kilogram of flour made\r\nunder their eyes: in one of these loaves was put twelve grains of\r\nsulphate of copper, in another eight grains, in a third four grains, and\r\nbut two grains in the fourth. These loaves rose ill, and although the\r\nflour with which they were made produced bread very beautiful and white,\r\nthe four loaves were so heavy as scarcely to present any cavities. The\r\nloaf No. 1 had a green disagreeable colour; the loaf No. 2 was in like\r\nmanner green, but of a less deep colour than the preceding; No. 3 was\r\nalso greenish; and No. 4, though colourless, could not support a\r\ncomparison with the bread made from the same flour pure.\r\n\r\nAll these loaves were burnt separately in porcelain crucibles to\r\ncomplete ashes. Those of the loaf No. 1 were a beautiful azure blue;\r\nthose of No. 2 a clearer sky-blue; those of No. 3 had a blue tint of a\r\nlighter hue; and those of No. 4 were so slightly coloured that it would\r\nhave been impossible to infer that they contained copper. But all these\r\nashes, when submitted to the action of sulphuric acid diluted with\r\nwater, were dissolved, and when tested separately by hydrosulphuric\r\nacid, produced black precipitates of sulphuret of copper, which\r\nprecipitates, tested separately in their turn by concentrated nitric\r\nacid, furnished each a quantity of nitrate of copper, equal, within a\r\nfew fractions, to the sulphate added to each of the four loaves.\r\n\r\nIt results, therefore, from the preceding experiments which have been\r\nmade with the greatest care,\r\n\r\n1. That the sulphate of copper (blue vitriol) cannot be used in making\r\nbread for the purpose of rendering it lighter or whiter, because it\r\nprevents its rising, and gives it a disagreeable colour;\r\n\r\n2. That by reducing it to ashes, and employing suitable means, almost\r\nall the salt of copper added to the bread may be collected again.\r\n\r\nWe should exceed the bounds of this Article if we were to re-produce the\r\nnumerous reports on the bread or flour submitted to the analysis of the\r\ncouncil, and especially on the bread and flour destined for the use of\r\nprisons, on mixed flour, and on the quality of bread prepared from flour\r\nmixed with starch. The council after examining this bread remarked, that\r\nit was not disagreeable to the taste, nor liable to injure the health.\r\nHowever, they were not able to pronounce on its nutritive qualities. It\r\nhas therefore been recommended that if bread made of flour so mixed was\r\noffered for sale, it should have a peculiar form, in order that the\r\npublic should know what is the nature of the food which is sold to them.\r\nThe same conclusions have been come to with respect to the sale of bread\r\nmade of flour mixed with a seventh of the flour of rice. This bread is,\r\naccording to the council, savoury and it keeps well, and does not become\r\nhard so soon as the bread prepared in the ordinary way. As to its\r\nnutritive qualities, the council cannot determine on this particular,\r\nthe question being one of those which, in the actual state of science,\r\nis the most difficult, and which can only be solved by a prolonged use\r\nof the bread. To complete the series of reports on all that concerns\r\nthis species of food, we must speak of the leaden reservoirs made use of\r\nby bakers. It was of moment to know whether the employment by the bakers\r\nof Paris of leaden reservoirs to keep the water used in making bread\r\ncould give rise to accidents; whether these reservoirs should be\r\nprohibited, or whether they might be allowed with certain modifications?\r\n\r\nThe council have studied this important question, which is become among\r\nchemists an object of controversy. Some have affirmed that the water\r\ngets charged with oxide of lead by remaining in reservoirs formed of\r\nthis metal. Other chemists, of no less repute, and among others Guyton\r\nde Morveaux, have established, on the contrary, that the presence of a\r\nneutral salt, like sulphate, nitrate or muriate, in whatever quantity,\r\nas 000·2, suffices to prevent the water from dissolving the lead; and\r\nthey explain in this way the use that is made, without any ill effects,\r\nof the water of the Seine, and of wells, preserved in leaden vessels,\r\nwith or without exposure to the air.\r\n\r\nThis diversity of opinion rendered necessary numerous experiments, which\r\nhave been made with the greatest exactness by a commission of the\r\ncouncil. It results from these experiments:—\r\n\r\n1. That distilled water put into a reservoir gives rise at the end of\r\nsome minutes to the formation of a salt of white-lead, but that this\r\nsalt does not dissolve in the water, and is precipitated, on the\r\ncontrary, to the bottom of the reservoir.\r\n\r\n2. That the waters of the Seine, and of wells, placed in leaden\r\nreservoirs, have given rise, at the point of contact of the water and\r\nair, to the formation of a white saline matter, which does not dissolve\r\nin water but is precipitated to the bottom of the vessel.\r\n\r\n3. That the gaseous Seltz water acts the same on the leaden reservoirs\r\nas the water of the Seine, and of wells. Before affirming what precedes,\r\nthe commission left some water for several weeks in four leaden\r\nreservoirs. The liquid was almost entirely evaporated, and the remainder\r\nof the water, when filtered, showed no trace of lead on the application\r\nof the most delicate tests, such as the chromate of potash,\r\nhydrosulphuric acid, and hydriodate of potash.\r\n\r\nWater which had remained in a bucket, spread over at the moment, and\r\nthroughout its whole extent, with a saline matter composed of carbonate\r\nof lead and of lime, of sulphate of lime and organic substances, did not\r\nleave the slightest trace of lead by the action on the water of the most\r\npowerful tests.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these experiments, the council pronounced a formal\r\nopinion, that the bakers might be permitted the use of leaden reservoirs\r\non condition that they put a cock three inches from the bottom of the\r\nreservoir, in order that if the insoluble carbonate formed it might be\r\ndeposited in the water below the cock, and with the further condition\r\nthat the reservoir should be cleaned once a-month. For greater security,\r\nthe council thought that it should be required of bakers to cover over\r\nthe lead which lines these reservoirs with a thin coat of wax, which\r\nwould prevent the contact of the water with the metal, and stop the\r\nformation of the insoluble carbonate of lead. To apply this wax it is\r\nonly necessary to heat slightly the lead, and rub it rapidly and several\r\ntimes with a piece of wool done over with wax.\r\n\r\nBesides these questions which relate to the quality of the bread, the\r\ncouncil examined what mischief could arise from the use of copper scales\r\nto weigh the dough of which the bread is made. It is known that the\r\ndishes of these scales are copper, and that instead of being cleaned\r\nwith cloths they are cleaned with the chains by which they are\r\nsuspended, and which, for this purpose, are heaped together and act like\r\na brush. This state of things seriously engaged the attention of the\r\ncouncil with respect to the danger it presents. The dough, composed of\r\nwater and flour, and containing in addition a certain quantity of marine\r\nsalt, sticks to the dishes of the scales, and exercises on the metal a\r\nchemical action, of which the result is the oxide of copper. The oxide,\r\nor salts of copper, which is formed, next penetrates into the portion of\r\nthe dough which is afterwards detached by the friction of the chains.\r\n\r\nWe may suppose that in this case some of the oxide of copper would be\r\nintroduced into the bread, and that it is important for the public\r\nhealth to take measures to prevent, from negligence or imprudence, bread\r\nwhich contained even very small quantities of salts of copper, from\r\nbeing offered for consumption. The council thought that all danger would\r\nbe prevented.\r\n\r\n1. By compelling the bakers to use no scales but those of which the\r\ndishes were of tinned iron.\r\n\r\n2. In prescribing to them to clean the dishes of the scales by means of\r\nchains of tinned iron, which should only be used for this purpose.\r\n\r\n3. By obliging them to wash the chains, and the pan in which they are\r\nkept, with warm water.\r\n\r\n4. By prohibiting the bakers to employ in their bakehouses utensils of\r\nzinc, or red and yellow copper.\r\n\r\n5. By ordering the bakers, if it is not found expedient to impose the\r\nexecution of the measures indicated in the first and third articles, to\r\ntin substantially the chains and dishes of their scales, and any\r\nutensils of zinc, or red and yellow copper.\r\n\r\nThe council have been occupied at different periods with the\r\nadulterations of salt, and they have not ceased to lend active\r\nassistance to the measures of surveillance prescribed by the Government.\r\nUnhappily its efforts were long unsuccessful. Even now the analysis\r\nwhich has been made of more than 6000 samples of salt, proves that fraud\r\nalways exists, although of a kind less detrimental to the public health.\r\nIn 1829 the council proposed to forbid the sale of salt which contained\r\nfrom five to six per cent. of salts with a potash base, and to oppose,\r\nin addition, the sale of salt mixed with sea-weed, even in small\r\nquantities. The council has since renewed their investigations. More\r\nthan 3000 samples of salt, taken from the shops, were analysed by M.\r\nChevalier, who discovered that 309 samples were adulterated by ground\r\nplaster, or salts of potash, or sulphate of soda, or by the iodines.\r\nThese adulterations were found chiefly in the grey salts. The later\r\nexperiments of the council have confirmed these results. They have,\r\nmoreover, shown that the salt derived from the mines of the south is\r\nmore pure than the salt of the west. It contains less water, and less of\r\nthe insoluble matter foreign to sea-salt.\r\n\r\nWe wish we could follow the council in their numerous observations on\r\nthe filtering of water—on the use of vessels and utensils of copper—on\r\nthe dangers they present according to the circumstances in which they\r\nare employed—and on the regulations of which they ought to be the\r\nobject; but there still remains much to be extracted, to show their\r\nsolicitude for everything which concerns the well-being of the people,\r\nand the preservation of the public health.\r\n\r\nThe council, in an article entitled, “Necessity to submit the\r\nConstruction of Houses to Sanitary Rules,” inserted in its General\r\nReport for 1827 (p. 39), expressed the wish to see established in the\r\ncentre of every quarter of the town a spacious square, railed in, and\r\nplanted with trees, in which the children of all classes might, without,\r\napprehension, and without the special superintendence of their parents,\r\ngive themselves up to the exercise suitable to their years, and in which\r\nthe inhabitants of all ages might enjoy the solar influence, and breathe\r\na purer air than in their dwellings. It is, they said, so much the more\r\nneedful to come to this determination, that nearly all the gardens have\r\ngiven place to houses, to streets, or to passages, and that the greater\r\npart of those which have been preserved are surrounded by houses so\r\nlofty that vegetation languishes for want of air and light, which\r\nrenders their existence more hurtful than beneficial to health. To these\r\nreasons, which have lost nothing of their force, we will add that which\r\nresults from the advantages the quarter would receive from the presence\r\nof such squares in respect to the healthiness produced by favouring the\r\nventilation of the streets; because a square is to all the streets which\r\nopen into it a true _fourneau d’appel_ with a double current, acting by\r\nnight as well as by day, at the same time that it is a powerful means by\r\nwhich to facilitate the action of the winds in the interior of the town.\r\n\r\nBy placing the charity schools in the vicinity of these squares an\r\nadvantage would be offered to the children of the poor which can rarely\r\nbe procured for them, that of experiencing the salutary action of the\r\nsun, breathing a pure air, and taking their exercise safe from all\r\ndanger during vacations and play-hours.\r\n\r\nThese powerful considerations naturally lead the council to speak of the\r\nconstruction of houses under the double relation of public and private\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\n“There are,” they say, “in the march of civilization, as in that of\r\nsciences, epochs of progress which should be marked by the creation of\r\nnew laws. With all nations the monuments which attest their pride have\r\npreceded the monuments which testify to their true glory; the first,\r\nsterile, so to speak, in their existence, fix the attention by the\r\nbeauty of their form, by the elegance and grandeur of their proportions;\r\nthe second, created for the wealth or happiness of nations, attract our\r\nnotice to the utility or wisdom of their establishment. This epoch of\r\ntrue glory has arrived for France. Enough of sterile monuments cover her\r\nsoil, still unfruitful in so many respects. Works of public utility,\r\nlaws which conduce to the common happiness, these are the monuments that\r\nit is proposed to raise at the present day.\r\n\r\n“It is a monument of this last kind of which the council ventures to\r\nsuggest the erection, in demanding a law to regulate the construction of\r\ntowns, villages, and houses, under the double relation of public and\r\nprivate health; a monumental law, if ever there was one, since it will\r\nembrace France in its conceptions; all the citizens will enjoy its\r\nbenefits with a perfect equality; and the poor man, even more than the\r\nrich, will find himself protected by it in his health, in his life, in\r\nhis happiness; because health is life—it is more, it is happiness.\r\n\r\n“A similar law has never existed among any ancient people, although we\r\nfind among several of them no equivocal proofs of the solicitude of\r\ntheir legislators to introduce into the laws some precepts of health,\r\napplicable to the people they governed.\r\n\r\n“We certainly find among the greater part of modern nations some\r\nordinances, and regulations, relative to the salubrity of towns and\r\nhouses; but their operation does not extend beyond the localities for\r\nwhich they were made, and little, or not at all, known out of these\r\nlocalities, they are still very imperfect, and altogether insufficient\r\nfor the localities themselves.\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, can any one doubt the immense influence which the\r\nsalubrity of towns, of villages, and of the dwelling, even when it is\r\nisolated in the midst of fields, exercises on the health and life of the\r\npeople. All statistics, general and individual, attest this extreme\r\ninfluence; and there is no physician, a little observing, who has not\r\nhad frequent occasions to verify it at the bed-side of his patients.\r\n\r\n“We must be like the men, so well painted by the Psalmist, to reject\r\nsuch evidence—_eyes have they and see not_. How shall we explain, or\r\nrather, to what shall we attribute the difference that is remarked\r\nbetween the mortality of one quarter and that of another quarter of the\r\nsame town; of one street and that of another street of the same quarter\r\nor of the same village; or, lastly, the difference that is observed in\r\nthis respect between the houses of the same street, and those houses\r\nwhich are completely isolated. Misery, it is replied to us, is the\r\ncause. Yes, without doubt, misery is a powerful cause; but it is so\r\nespecially when it is driven back into the most insalubrious quarters,\r\nstreets, and houses; when it lives habitually in the midst of filth and\r\ndirt, that is to say, in the midst of an infected atmosphere; and when\r\nthere is no misery, or when it exists in the same degree in the\r\nquarters, in the villages, in the streets, and in the houses with which\r\nthe comparison is made, and, stronger still, when poverty is met with\r\nprecisely there where there is the least mortality, in what is to be\r\nfound the cause of this difference, if it is not in the insalubrity of\r\nthe dwelling-places?\r\n\r\n“If you had not seen yourself, Monsieur le Prefet, in one of the most\r\nbeautiful streets of Paris, and in the vicinity of the most frequented\r\npromenade of the capital, the influence which the construction of the\r\nhouses we inhabit has on the health, we would seek by some facts to\r\nconvince you of this truth; but we are happy to need only to refer you\r\nto your own experience. This great fact, which naturally results from\r\nthe comparison you have drawn, in a report addressed to the Minister of\r\nCommerce, the 31st of June, 1832, between the mortality of the quarter\r\nof the Hôtel-de-Ville, and that of the quarter of the Chaussée-d’Antin,\r\nhas not escaped you. Yet, in the striking difference which is found\r\nbetween the mortality of these two quarters, you have not taken into\r\naccount the poor who died in the hospitals, and who were, undeniably,\r\nmore numerous from the quarter of the Hôtel-de-Ville than from that of\r\nthe Chaussée-d’Antin. What calculation has demonstrated to you for one\r\nquarter of Paris exists in all in different degrees; and the same\r\ncalculation applied to other localities, very distant from the capital,\r\nin which the condition, the habits, the mode of living, and the nature\r\nof the labour which the inhabitants perform are nearly the same, has\r\ngiven analogous results, presenting the same extremes, without the\r\npossibility of assigning any other cause than the insalubrity of the\r\ndwellings understood in its widest acceptation.\r\n\r\n“The council might accumulate facts, calculations, and quotations, to\r\nsupport the opinion they have formed of the necessity of a law to\r\nregulate the construction of towns, villages, and houses, under the\r\ndouble relation of public and private health; but they have no need to\r\nbe at this pains to induce you to share their conviction, and they are\r\nfully persuaded that, in proposing to you to promote a law so important,\r\nthey are only anticipating your desire to co-operate for the well-being:\r\nof your fellow-citizens, and to aid the enlightened zeal of the Minister\r\nof the Interior for all that is great and useful.”\r\n\r\nUnder certain points of view, salubrity confounds itself with health; on\r\nanother side, it governs health; because, without it no good rules of\r\nhealth can be established. Thus it has engaged the special attention of\r\nthe council. We see them to shrink from no difficulty, from no mission,\r\nhowever painful, however dangerous even, it may be. Nothing escapes\r\ntheir vigilant attention, and the administration is always sure to have\r\ntheir aid in all the amendments that it wishes to introduce into this\r\nimportant branch of public service. It is thus that they pass in review\r\nall which appertains to the wholesomeness of sewers, to the improvement\r\nof the paving, to the establishment of street-fountains, to the flow of\r\nwater for domestic or manufacturing purposes, to the cleansing of wells,\r\nand of waste-water wells. The construction of the receptacles of\r\nprivies, those incessant causes of insalubrity and inconvenience,\r\noccupies them above all. Here is what they say upon this point:—\r\n\r\n“The emptying of the privies in the city of Paris has become a very\r\nheavy expense to the proprietors, and the expense is always on the\r\nincrease, in consequence of the modifications in the construction of the\r\nreceptacles, and the more abundant use of water; a use rendered\r\nnecessary by the actual form of the seats, and still more by the\r\nintroduction of private baths.\r\n\r\n“It is evident that the first condition for obtaining a result at once\r\neconomical and salubrious, is to separate, on the spot, the solid matter\r\nfrom the liquid, to preserve what has an intrinsic value, and to reject\r\nwhat is only cumbersome.\r\n\r\n“For more than half a century some men, animated by love for the public\r\ngood, and several speculators, have directed their researches to\r\ndiscover a method of making this separation. At the head of these are\r\nGirard and Gourlier, Casaneuve, Sanson, Derosne, Chaumet, the authors of\r\nthe article in the _Mémorial de l’Officier du Génie_, and, lastly, the\r\narchitects Payen and Dalmont.\r\n\r\n“The system of Gourlier is seducing: if it has not yet been submitted to\r\nall the trials it requires, we are able to predict before hand that it\r\nwill succeed, and that it will be productive of advantage.\r\n\r\n“The benefits of the project of Gourlier are found in a higher degree in\r\nthat which has been adopted in barracks.[55]\r\n\r\n“The system of movable receptacles has the sanction of time, is\r\napplicable everywhere, facilitates the removal of the contents, and\r\nenables it to be done without smell or dirt: it preserves the workmen\r\nfrom the dangers of asphyxy, prevents the decay of our houses, and\r\ncontributes to augment the disposable mass of manure.\r\n\r\n“To prevent the gravest consequences, it is essential not to conduct the\r\nliquid from the privies into waste-water wells, and put them in\r\ncommunication with the upper layer of the soil in which our wells are\r\nsunk. Prudence requires that the liquid should not be directed into the\r\nsecond layer, which in many parts of Paris furnishes very good water. If\r\nit is possible, without great inconvenience, to conduct it into channels\r\naltogether lower, it is still the opinion of many experienced persons\r\nthat it ought not to be done under Paris for any very considerable\r\nquantities of water, and that it is necessary to reserve this resource\r\nfor localities badly situated, and which are rarely met with.\r\n\r\n“All the proofs show that the liquid of the privies may be discharged\r\ninto the Seine without inconvenience. An investigation conducted\r\nformerly by Hallé and Fourcroy, on the sweepings of Paris, adds great\r\nweight to this opinion. The ancient and recent gaugings, as well as the\r\ndaily observation of facts, demonstrate that the quantity of dirty water\r\nsent into the Seine would be so small compared to the water of the\r\nriver, that it would always remain unperceived, and could in no way be\r\ninjurious to health.\r\n\r\n“To convey these waters to the Seine, the first idea which presents\r\nitself is to cast them into one of the three great sewers which surround\r\nParis on the north.\r\n\r\n“A mass of facts and observations prove that the discharge into the\r\nsewers of the liquid from the privies will not infect the sewers, nor\r\ncause danger to those who work in them; that this infection will be so\r\nmuch the less to be apprehended with the apparatus of Gourlier, with\r\nthat which has been adopted in barracks, and with the movable\r\nreceptacles, that, by these different methods, the separation taking\r\nplace slowly and successively, the liquid carries along with it but very\r\nlittle of solid matter.\r\n\r\n“Everything seems to show that by mixing the liquid from the privies\r\nwith a sufficient quantity of water it might, without inconvenience, be\r\nthrown upon the public way, and got rid of in this manner; but prudence\r\nrequires that before any innovations of this kind the project should be\r\nsubmitted to minute and multiplied experiments. These experiments are\r\nthe more important, that the result would be to increase the revenues of\r\nthe city by the sale of a considerable quantity of water which it has\r\nfor disposal.\r\n\r\n“If the drying of the solid contents of the privies has hitherto been\r\nconsidered as one of the most infectious and inconvenient trades, it may\r\nbe affirmed that it can now be made one of the less disagreeable, a\r\ncircumstance which we owe to the means of disinfection recently\r\ndiscovered, or which, formerly known, have not been put in practice till\r\nlately on a large scale.[56]\r\n\r\n“To favour the employment of these means, and to arrive thereby at\r\nresults of high importance, it is not sufficient for the administration\r\nto be animated by praiseworthy intentions. It must obtain, by its\r\ninterposition with the supreme authority, a modification in the\r\nclassification of the establishments in which the fecal substances are\r\nprepared, and, above all, must use the means at its disposal to disabuse\r\nthe public of the prejudices it entertains against these sort of places.\r\nThe administration will meet at first with very great obstacles, but,\r\nwith time and perseverance, may rest confident of success.\r\n\r\n“The changes proposed are of such importance, they will be attended by\r\nconsequences so useful, and extensive, that they will be sufficient to\r\nrender illustrious to future generations, and to recommend to their\r\ngratitude, the name of the ministers who shall effect them.”\r\n\r\nSince their institution, the “Conseil de Salubrité” have been charged to\r\nvisit all the parts of France in which epidemic sicknesses have\r\nappeared. Thus we find them in 1807 investigating the autumnal disorders\r\nwhich broke out at Créteil, at Maisons, at Charenton, &c., and proposing\r\nthe creation of a travelling hospital to render aid to the country\r\ndistricts during the prevalence of epidemics. Some years later, in 1810,\r\nthey went to Montreuil, to Montmartre, and other communes in which the\r\nsmall-pox had assumed an epidemic character; to Pantin where there\r\nreigned an epidemic fever; to Fontenay-sur-Bois, Rosny, &c., where some\r\nravages had been made by the dysentery. In 1812 they set forth the\r\ncauses of the epidemic maladies which had declared themselves in the\r\ncommunes of Charonne, and Clicky, and by this means prevented their\r\nrecurrence. In 1818 they stopped the progress of an endemic fever in the\r\ncommune of Chevilly, and of the croup in the commune of Montreuil. In\r\n1825 the small-pox committed great ravages among the inhabitants of\r\nParis, and of the rural communes of the department of the Seine. Brought\r\nby a mass of workmen who flocked from the country to partake of the high\r\nwages produced by a glut of employment, it was rapidly propagated among\r\na population who, through carelessness, or prejudice, had rejected the\r\nblessing of vaccination. The small-pox, favoured in its development by\r\nthe high temperature of the atmosphere, gave rise for a moment to a\r\ndoubt of the preservative property of the vaccine. An eruptive malady,\r\nthe _varioloïde_, confounded with the small-pox by people in general,\r\nand by inattentive and inexperienced medical men, originated this idea,\r\nwhich some cases—rare certainly, but distinctly marked—of small-pox in\r\npersons who had had the true cow-pox, appeared to confirm. It was then\r\nfeared that the vaccine had lost with time the advantages which rendered\r\nit so precious; that, weakened in its nature, by passing from one\r\nindividual to another through a long course of years, it was no more\r\nsusceptible of modifying the organization in a manner to render it\r\ninaccessible to the small-pox. It became therefore important to examine\r\nwith care this interesting point of practice. The difficult task was\r\nperformed by the council, and the administration, enlightened by their\r\nreports, was able both to re-assure the people justly alarmed, and to\r\ntake the proper measures to arrest an evil of which no one could foresee\r\nthe consequences.\r\n\r\nIt is by such labours that the council prepared themselves for the noble\r\nand grand mission which was reserved for them by the appearance in the\r\ncapital of the cholera morbus,—a mission which they fulfilled with so\r\nmuch courage and devotion. In the midst of this public calamity, the\r\n“Conseil de Salubrité,” we do not hesitate to say, surpassed all\r\nexpectation. This same zeal was manifested in 1837, when the epidemic\r\ncatarrh made some ravages in the capital. Since then, with the exception\r\nof local maladies of little importance, the “Conseil de Salubrité” have\r\nnot been called upon to occupy themselves with epidemics.\r\n\r\nThe _épizooties_ are in many respects less serious than the epidemics.\r\nNevertheless, as they often affect the animals which serve for the\r\nnutriment of man, and that, apart from this consideration, they may have\r\ngrave consequences for the public health, they have constantly engaged\r\nthe care of the council. In 1834 an _épizootie_ was reported to the\r\nadministration, which prevailed among the cows of the communes round\r\nParis, and which caused a great mortality. The researches of the council\r\nestablished that this _épizootie_ was only a chronic disease, a true\r\npulmonary phthisis to which has been given the name of _pommeliere_, and\r\nby which the greater part of the cows had been attacked which fill the\r\nstables of the milkmen of Paris and its environs. According to the\r\ncouncil, the principal cause of the evil was to be attributed to the\r\nvicious regimen to which this species of animal is subjected. “It is\r\nknown that they pass a part of the year in stables perfectly closed, in\r\nwhich the space is not proportioned to the number of inmates, in which\r\nthe vitiated air renews itself with extreme difficulty, and in which the\r\nheat is sometimes suffocating. It is known also that they pass suddenly\r\nfrom the food of the stable to pasture, and that in this change they go\r\nfrom the hot and humid atmosphere of the stable, to a sudden exposure to\r\nthe continual variations of the external air. This alternation of food,\r\nand of heat and cold, operates as a powerful cause of disease. But as\r\nthe evil does not announce itself in a violent manner, as its progress\r\nis not very rapid, as there is even a period in the disease in which the\r\nanimal is disposed to get flesh, the cow-feeder, who knows to what point\r\nto keep her, sells her when she is ready to calve. It is in a radius of\r\nthirty leagues from the capital that cows of this kind are purchased by\r\nthe jobbers who supply the milkmen of Paris. With these last they still\r\nhold out a certain number of years, if they are properly cared for; but\r\nin general they are kept in stables which are neither sufficiently\r\nlarge, nor sufficiently airy, where they are exposed to the same causes\r\nwhich gave birth to the malady. The phthisis arrives insensibly at its\r\nlast stage, and carries off every year from Paris, and its\r\nneighbourhood, a great number of these cows.\r\n\r\n“As to the question, whether the sale of the flesh of oxen that have\r\ndied from the diseases just described should be allowed, the council\r\nhave already shown that, from time immemorial, the meat of cows attacked\r\nby pulmonary phthisis in a slight degree, has been consumed at Paris as\r\ngood cow-beef. Often even cows which have reached the last stage of this\r\ndisease are consigned to the butcher, who offers their flesh for sale as\r\nmeat of the second quality, after taking the precaution to cut away the\r\nlungs, the pericardium, the mediastin, and those parts of the sides and\r\ndiaphragm, which present a state of disorganization more or less\r\nadvanced. This commerce has always taken place in the environs of Paris,\r\nand in Paris itself before the establishment of the _abattoirs_; and if\r\nwe are not able to affirm that food of this nature is not bad, there is\r\nat least no example of its use having given rise to accidents. It is to\r\nbe presumed that in this case, as in many others, the cooking destroys\r\nthe vicious properties of the flesh, and deprives it of all the\r\nqualities injurious to the health of the consumer.\r\n\r\n“The council have, however, been far from drawing from all these facts\r\nthe conclusion that it is unnecessary to watch over the sale of\r\nbutchers’ meat. They think, on the contrary, that this superintendence\r\ncannot be too active, in order that the low price of such meat may not\r\nlead poor families to make it habitually their principal sustenance. It\r\nis known that a bad diet which is not injurious when used casually, may\r\nbecome, by its continual employment, a source of disease. Numerous\r\nobservations have equally taught us, that the flesh of animals in which\r\nputrefaction had commenced, has produced in persons who touched it the\r\nmost serious consequences. The council, building upon such data, believe\r\nthat it is indispensable to watch with the greatest care the sale of\r\nmeat, to have destroyed all the bad meat which is exposed in the shops,\r\nand to forbid the butchers to sell the flesh of any animal that has died\r\nfrom disease, or been killed in consequence of disease, unless a\r\nveterinary surgeon and physician, appointed by authority, have decided\r\nthat the meat could be eaten without inconvenience.”\r\n\r\nSome considerations of a kind still more general are developed in the\r\nimportant report made by the commission, charged in 1839 with the\r\ninvestigation of the disease called _cocotte_, which attacked the\r\nmilking-cows, and deeply occupied the public attention.\r\n\r\nWe stated at the commencement of this article, that the number of\r\nreports made by the “Conseil de Salubrité,” during the years comprised\r\nin this account, amounts to 4431. This number greatly surpasses in its\r\nproportions that of the preceding years, that is to say, of the twenty\r\nyears which form the first period of their labours, dating from their\r\ninstitution, and which only presents a total of 5008 reports. This\r\narises from the fact that Paris for a long time has been only a city of\r\nproduce, and that the labours of the council have necessarily increased\r\nwith the progress of trade, and the character, altogether manufacturing,\r\nassumed by the department of the Seine since 1815. It is necessary,\r\nmoreover, to remark that the provisions of the decree of 1810 on\r\ninsalubrious establishments, by submitting certain classes of\r\nmanufactories to special authorizations, rendered more frequent the\r\nintervention of the council, who were the first to demonstrate the\r\nnecessity of these new measures. “It is a great satisfaction to the\r\ncouncil,” say the reporters of their labours for the year 1810, “that\r\nevery year the observations and reports lead to general measures which\r\nsimplify your administration, by giving certain rules of which the\r\napplication becomes every day more easy. The public health was long\r\nsince compromised by the existence of certain manufactures, and in the\r\ngeneral accounts we have rendered we have never ceased to demand the\r\nremoval of insalubrious establishments. The National Institute,\r\nconsulted on this important point, shared our opinion, and a regulatory\r\nlaw has just designated the manufactures which may be established in the\r\ninterior of towns, and those which are not to be tolerated there.”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1811 we find 118 reports on classed establishments. This\r\nnumber increased in 1812, and so from year to year, till in 1813, 313\r\nreports were made on establishments of this kind. The use of\r\nsteam-engines increased the labours of the council. In 1813, for\r\ninstance, there was but one report on these engines; in 1822, the number\r\nhad risen already to fifteen. The examination of these machines led the\r\ncouncil to examine their different systems, the dangers and\r\ninconveniences they presented to the public health or safety, and we\r\nforesee, in reading their important observations on this subject, all\r\nthe improvements which experience introduced in the sequel into this new\r\nbranch of industry. If we pass from the year 1822 to the year 1839, we\r\nfind there has been read ninety-six reports on engines of this\r\ndescription: but they are no longer simple considerations on machines of\r\nwhich the use is not well understood; they are views of an elevated\r\norder, both on the application of these engines, and on their dangers\r\nand inconveniences. We see that the council have profoundly studied\r\nthese important questions.\r\n\r\n“We have united under one head,” says M. Busy, the reporter, “all the\r\nestablishments on which reports have been made relative to\r\nsteam-engines. Each of these establishments doubtless offers by itself\r\nsome inconveniences inherent in the kind of trade carried on; but in\r\ngeneral these inconveniences are trifling. The greater part of the\r\nmanufactories about which there is a question are for the construction\r\nof engines, and other analogous things, which can only affect the\r\nneighbourhood by the noise and activity which reign there. Out of\r\nsixty-three reports made to the council on steam-engines, eleven were on\r\nsawing-machines, nine on shops for the construction of engines, six on\r\nfulminating powder-mills, four on factories for printing and preparing\r\nstuffs, three on mechanical printing presses. The other reports are\r\ndivided in the following manner:\r\n\r\n“On machines for flattening metal, for bruising colours, for\r\npulverizing, for mixing mortar, for extracting stone, seven; for sugar\r\nrefining, for the making of sugar of starch, three; for spinning, two;\r\nfor turning, two; for optical glasses, two; for polishing steel, one;\r\nfor cleaning grain, for the preservation of provisions, three; for\r\nperfumery, two: for soap-making, two; for bleaching, for making candles,\r\nhats, and delf-ware, for ironfounding, for scouring ashes, six; total\r\n63.\r\n\r\n“There has been made besides on simple steam-boilers 33 reports, divided\r\namong different trades in the following manner, viz:—\r\n\r\n          For printing and preparing of stuffs and woollens 12\r\n          Hat manufactories                                  7\r\n          Wax and tallow candle manufactories                3\r\n          The shops of mechanicians                          2\r\n          Refining                                           2\r\n          Soap-making                                        2\r\n          Extraction of the colouring matter from dye-woods  2\r\n          Baths                                              2\r\n          Dyeing                                             1\r\n\r\n“If we add these 33 reports to the 63 preceding, we have a total of 96\r\nreports on steam-engines, or simple boilers. We join them together in\r\nconsequence of the identity of the inconveniences to which these\r\nmachines give rise. These inconveniences can only proceed from the\r\nchance of explosion of compressed steam, or from the chance of fire, and\r\nfrom the presence of smoke, which accompany the establishment of every\r\nfurnace, whatever may be its use. It is true, however, that among the\r\ncomplaints or objections which have reached the council, several have\r\nturned upon the noise and shaking occasioned by the steam-engines, a\r\nshaking which is particularly felt in houses a little shut in, and\r\nconnected with the neighbouring houses. This occurred with the printing\r\npresses, and some other mechanical applications of steam.\r\n\r\n“But these results are altogether independent of the steam itself, are\r\ninherent in the imperfection of the mechanism employed, and would be\r\nproduced with much greater intensity by substituting for steam a horse,\r\na fall of water, the action of the wind, or any other mechanical motor.\r\n\r\n“If we consider the steam-engines and boilers with respect to the\r\nexplosions to which they may give birth, we see that no accident has\r\nhappened during the current year from a total or partial explosion of an\r\nengine, and yet there is no complaint or opposition which is not swelled\r\nby the fear of these dangers. If the accidents of this nature may with\r\njustice, by their seriousness and sphere of action, provoke the fears of\r\nthe neighbours, the wise measures prescribed by the rules are of a\r\nnature to render them impossible, when they are faithfully executed.\r\nThus, Monsieur le Prefect, the council have always vigorously insisted\r\non the maintenance of the precautions with which the law surrounds the\r\nsteam-engines, not only to shield the responsibility of your\r\nadministration, but also because they are persuaded that it is\r\nimpossible in the actual state of things to neglect these prescriptions\r\nwithout exposing those who make use of steam-engines to eminent dangers.\r\n\r\n“The true and the most serious inconvenience of steam-engines is the\r\nsmoke. It is against this that most of the well-founded complaints are\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n“This inconvenience is not only felt at the present moment, but it\r\nexcites, above all, apprehensions for the future.\r\n\r\n“When we consider that in the single year 1839, there have been granted\r\n82 authorizations for steam-engines, and that we are yet but at the\r\nbeginning of the applications of this mechanical agent,—when we follow\r\nthe increasing progression of petitions addressed to the administration,\r\nwe are not able to suppress a certain fear against the ulterior\r\ninvasions of the smoke from these establishments.\r\n\r\n“The council have applied themselves for a long time to the solution of\r\nthis difficulty, which is met at every turn in the petitions addressed\r\nto you, not only for steam-engines, but for all the trades in which\r\nfurnaces are employed.\r\n\r\n“Various systems have been proposed: that which first presents itself is\r\nthe use of smoke-consuming furnaces, which appears in fact the most\r\nrational and appropriate. Nevertheless, although it is very easy to\r\nassign the theoretical conditions for complete combustion of coal, the\r\ndifficulties of application have not permitted this kind of furnace to\r\nbecome general. Hitherto the smoke-consuming furnaces require great\r\nprecision in the execution, great regularity in the distribution of the\r\nfuel,—things difficult to realize in ordinary labour. On the other hand,\r\nthe great excess of air necessary to obtain complete combustion often\r\ndiminishes the efficacy of the coal, and renders these furnaces more\r\nexpensive, in certain cases, than the ordinary furnaces, in spite of the\r\nloss of fuel which the latter involve.\r\n\r\n“The mechanical distributors to regulate the supply of fuel, and the\r\nactivity of the combustion, have been also proposed and employed with\r\nsuccess; but they are a considerable expense at the outset, and can be\r\nbut little adopted except in great concerns, and where there is a very\r\nconstant application of steam.\r\n\r\n“It remains to modify the nature of the fuel; and it is this which the\r\ncouncil have generally done. They commonly prescribe the use of coke, or\r\nsome variety of prepared coal, which gives no smoke—leaving it however\r\nto the proprietors to make use of whichever method suits them best,\r\nwhether smoke-consuming furnaces, mechanical distributors, or fuel which\r\nyields no smoke.\r\n\r\n“These regulations, Monsieur le Prefect, have been adopted in principle\r\nby the “Conseil de Salubrité,” and are, in the majority of cases, the\r\ncondition to which they think it their duty to submit the authorizations\r\nthey have the honour to propose to you.\r\n\r\n“Doubtless their rigorous application may cramp certain establishments.\r\nThe council are not ignorant that for some particular purposes the use\r\nof coke presents great obstacles, considering the construction of the\r\nfurnaces; but the absence of smoke in the combustion of coal is not so\r\nvery difficult to obtain, as to shake the intimate conviction of the\r\ncouncil that this constriction will be but momentary, and that it will\r\nend by turning to the profit of the manufacturer.\r\n\r\n“The problem of which the council seek the solution, is able to be\r\nresolved; it is so already in great part, but there yet remains one step\r\nto arrive at the goal, and they will reach it by persevering in the\r\ncourse they have adopted. In their efforts they have been sustained, we\r\nrepeat, by the conviction that they labour not only for the advantage of\r\nthe health and cleanliness of the capital, by seeking to guarantee its\r\ninhabitants from the nuisance of smoke, but also for the advantage of\r\nthe manufacturer himself, by forcing him to a better employment of his\r\nfuel, and by putting him into such a condition that he may be able to\r\nselect the localities which suit him, without being exposed to those\r\ncontinual complaints, to those recriminations, often well-founded, which\r\nhave not always been foreseen, and which sometimes become the cause of\r\nthe greatest embarrassments to the manufacturing establishments.\r\n\r\n“An important progress in the path we indicate was made in 1839, by the\r\ncontrivance of M. Beslay, a mechanician, for steam-boilers—a contrivance\r\nwhich has been pointed out in several reports on this subject, and which\r\nproposes to prevent explosions and avoid smoke by means of a general use\r\nof coke. It is only to be regretted that it has not yet been able to be\r\napplied to all the purposes for which steam-boilers are employed.”\r\n\r\nThe improvements introduced by the council into the different branches\r\nof industry with which they have had to deal, and on which their reports\r\nenter into details at once useful and interesting, are numerous. Thus\r\nthe refining of gold and silver, the factories for fulminating powder,\r\nfor gilding, for chemical products, for bitumen, for melting tallow, and\r\na mass of other trades, owe to them notable improvements, both in the\r\nmethods of fabrication, and in the conditions for public health and\r\nsafety under which they are to be carried on. The white-lead\r\nmanufactories have excited their earnest solicitude. It is known that\r\nthe workmen who labour in these places are subject to serious and\r\nfrequent maladies. In consulting the earlier labours of the council, we\r\nsee them unceasingly occupied with this question; but the frequency of\r\nthe accidents, and their seriousness, have more particularly attracted\r\ntheir attention in these latter times, and have engaged them to compile\r\na set of instructions which set forth the best rules of health to be\r\nobserved in these manufactories. (The rules have already been quoted.)\r\n\r\nLater, the council have anew examined deeply this branch of trade. They\r\nhave visited the manufactories of white-lead existing in the department\r\nof the Seine; they have obtained the experience of other departments,\r\nand they have shown the necessity of commissioning one of their members\r\nto follow the results of the rules quoted above. They have required,\r\nmoreover, that the administration should furnish some statistics on the\r\nstate of workers in white-lead admitted into the hospital. The\r\nadministration has hastened to defer to this wish, and there is no doubt\r\nthat there will result a sensible improvement in the health of the\r\nworkmen.\r\n\r\n(After giving several other minor instances of the labours of the\r\nConseil, the report thus concludes:—)\r\n\r\nAnd now that we have detailed the principal labours of the council, it\r\nwould be a necessary supplement to this article to show the results that\r\nhave followed from them,—the reforms they have introduced into the\r\npublic service. But here we are no more dealing with the labours of the\r\ncouncil, but with the labours of the administration. Thus independently\r\nof the decisions on classed establishments, and which amount to about\r\n300 a-year, it would be necessary to describe the measures for the\r\npublic health executed by the administration. But to confine ourselves\r\nonly to acts which interest the generality of the citizens, we may cite\r\nthe ordinances of police which relate to coloured sugar-plums; to horses\r\nattacked with the glanders, or contagious maladies; to vessels and\r\nutensils of copper; to the adulteration of salt; to the aid to be given\r\nto the drowned and asphyxied; to the depôts for refuse in the rural\r\ncommunes; to the dissection, modelling, and embalming of corpses; to the\r\ncleaning of wells and waste-water wells; to the adulteration and sale of\r\nfulminating powder; to the classification of new trades, the\r\namphitheatres of anatomy, the establishments of pork-butchers, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nCertainly there are few institutions that can show such results; there\r\nare few that receive an impulse so enlightened and constant. Bound in an\r\nintimate manner with the administration of which they form part, the\r\n“Conseil de Salubrité” has at all times, found in it a just appreciator\r\nof their labours. They know the credit accorded to their reports, and\r\nthe duties imposed on them by a confidence so honourable for the\r\nadministration that gives it, and so justly merited by the body that\r\nreceives it.\r\n\r\n\r\n   16.—_Qualifications of Officers of Public Health: Statement by_ M.\r\n                              DUCHÂTELET.\r\n\r\nIt is generally thought in the world that the medical knowledge acquired\r\nin the schools is all that is necessary to become a useful member of the\r\ncouncil. The greater part of medical men themselves share this opinion;\r\nand on the strength of some precepts which they have collected from\r\nbooks on health and professions, they think themselves sufficiently\r\ninstructed to decide on the instant the gravest questions, which can\r\nonly be resolved by special studies.\r\n\r\nA man may have exhausted medical literature; he may be an excellent\r\npractician at the sick-bed, a learned physician, a clever and eloquent\r\nprofessor; but all these acquirements, taken in themselves, are nearly\r\nuseless in a Conseil de Salubrité like that of Paris; and if an occasion\r\npresents itself to make use of them, a very small number of persons\r\nsuffice to apply them. To be really useful in the council, it is\r\nnecessary to have an extended knowledge of natural philosophy, of the\r\nconstitution of the soil on which Paris stands, and of the geology of\r\nneighbouring countries; it is necessary, above all, to know with\r\nexactness the action which trades may have on the health of those who\r\nexercise them, and the much more important action of manufactories of\r\nevery species on plants, on men congregated in towns, and on animals.\r\nThis knowledge, so important, of the action of manufactories and trades,\r\nis not to be acquired by ordinary study, or in the silence of the\r\ncabinet. It is not to be obtained without positive notions on the arts,\r\nand on the greater part of the processes peculiar to each trade. It\r\nrequires habit and the frequenting of the places of work. In this\r\nparticular, more even than with medicine, books are not a substitute for\r\npractice; and if there exist works on the subject, they are more likely\r\nto mislead than enlighten.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, the necessity will be evident to introduce into\r\nthe council those physicians who have made health, and particularly the\r\npublic health, a special study; and to join with them chemists, and,\r\nabove all, manufacturing chemists, because what would many of those\r\npersons, whose life has been passed in hospitals and the exclusive study\r\nof medicine, be before a steam engine? It is clear that they would often\r\nbe deceived by those adroit and skilful manufacturers who would have an\r\ninterest in concealing the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n17.—_Instance by_ MM. DUCHÂTELET _and_ D’ARCET _of the erroneous Medical\r\n        Inferences as to the insalubrity of particular Trades_.\r\n\r\nRamazzini is, as far as we know, the first who has treated professedly\r\nof the maladies produced by the fumes of tobacco. In his great work, _De\r\nMorbis Artificum_, he states that the workmen employed in the\r\nmanufacture of tobacco are seized with great pains in the head, with\r\nvertigo, nausea, and perpetual sneezing; and that so great is the\r\nsubtilty of this substance, that all the neighbourhood, particularly in\r\nsummer, experience nausea. He adds, that those who work on tobacco lose\r\ntheir appetite, and that their breath is insupportable.\r\n\r\nFourcroy, after repeating in his translation of Ramazzini all the\r\npassages from this author, adds, in a note, several observations to\r\nprove the dangers of tobacco; such as, that a lady died from a cancer in\r\nthe nose in consequence of taking too much snuff; another from a polypus\r\nin the œsophagus, which prevented her swallowing; another from frightful\r\nconvulsions produced by sleeping in a room in which tobacco had been\r\nrasped. Fourcroy states, however, that there are some privileged persons\r\nwho become accustomed to the action of tobacco, and experience no\r\ninconvenience from it.\r\n\r\nCadet-Gassicourt, in a memoir addressed to the prefect of police on the\r\nmaladies incident to the trades carried on in Paris, says that the\r\nworkmen occupied in the preparation of tobacco are subject to vomitings,\r\ncolics, and acute and chronic affections of the chest; that they have\r\noften vertigo, bloody fluxes, and are addicted to drink.\r\n\r\nTourtelle, in his _Elémens d’Hygiène_, affirms that it is very dangerous\r\nto sleep in warehouses of tobacco; and he quotes a case, mentioned by\r\nBuchoz, of a young girl of five, who died in a short time from dreadful\r\nvomitings, occasioned by this sole cause.\r\n\r\nPercy, in the article _Chapeau_, in the _Dictionnaire des Sciences\r\nMédicales_, mentions, that some soldiers, exercising in the\r\n_Champ-de-Mars_ in very warm weather, were overcome by syncope, which he\r\nattributes to some tobacco that these men had put in their caps.\r\n\r\nIn a new edition of Ramazzini and Fourcroy, by Patissier, we find the\r\nopinions of these authors without observation or comment. The editor is\r\ncontent to add, that those who have to do with tobacco are, in general,\r\nwasted, discoloured, yellow, and asthmatical.\r\n\r\nFinally, Merat, in the article _Tabac_, in the _Dictionnaire des\r\nSciences Médicales_, says, that men engaged in the preparation of this\r\nsubstance are wasted, discoloured, yellow, asthmatic, subject to colic,\r\ndiarrhœa, the bloody flux, but, above all, to vertigo, cephalalgia,\r\nmuscular tremor, to true narcotism, and to diseases, more or less acute,\r\nof the chest. “All these assertions,” he continues, “are the fruit of my\r\nobservations in the hospitals of Paris. Tobacco causes not only evils\r\nwithout number, but even death to those who prepare it. It deranges the\r\nmemory of all who inhale it, and renders it less clear and entire; it\r\nweakens the tissues, especially the nervous tissues; it causes trembling\r\nof the limbs; diminishes strength; it produces emaciation, and even\r\nconsumption, particularly among females; and sometimes begets entire\r\nimbecility.”\r\n\r\n“We might multiply these quotations. The just celebrity of the authors\r\nwho have furnished them gives to their opinion a force which imposes\r\nbelief, and makes us reject every species of doubt. Let us recall,\r\nhowever, the maxim of Descartes; let us cease to believe the words of a\r\nmaster; let us dare to doubt for an instant, and, observing for\r\nourselves, let us learn to form an opinion, based on what our own senses\r\nand judgment have taught us.”\r\n\r\nActing in this spirit, Parent Duchâtelet and D’Arcet carried on a minute\r\ninvestigation, in a vast manufactory of tobacco at Paris, containing\r\n1,054 workmen. Not content with the results afforded by a single\r\nestablishment, they directed questions to the nine other great\r\nmanufactories of tobacco which France contains, and the answers were\r\nprepared by the physicians, surgeons, and officers of each establishment\r\nin conjunction. “The observations,” say MM. Duchâtelet and D’Arcet,\r\n“which compose this memoir, have been collected from a sum total of 4518\r\nworkmen. They appear to us so much the more valuable and conclusive,\r\nthat they have been made simultaneously in the most opposite parts of\r\nFrance, by men who had not, and could not have, any connexion. There is\r\nthus no possibility to suspect the influence of a preconceived opinion;\r\nand if those to whom our inquiries were addressed are unanimous in their\r\nreplies, and if these replies agree with our own observations, we shall\r\nbe sure that we have arrived at the truth.”\r\n\r\nThe conclusions which followed from these widely extended researches\r\nwere—\r\n\r\n1. That in the greater part of the factories there was never known an\r\nexample of an individual who could not accustom himself to the\r\nemanations of tobacco, and that in the rare cases where it proved\r\ninjurious, it was always in a particular part of the process, which\r\nmerely obliged the workman to be transferred to another department of\r\nthe factory.\r\n\r\n2. That all which has been said on the frequency of nausea, of\r\nvomitings, of diarrhœa, of colic, and of haemorrhages, is pure\r\nsupposition. That it is so no less with respect to the headaches,\r\nsneezings, loss of appetite, foulness of breath, acute and chronic\r\naffections of the chest, cancers, and other similar diseases. What the\r\nsame authors say on the discolouration of the skin of the workmen\r\nengaged in the preparation of tobacco, on the yellow hue of their\r\ncomplexion, their leanness, and emaciation, proves that they have not\r\nobserved for themselves, or have only seen the exceptions to the rule,\r\nor have not compared this class of people with other workmen of the same\r\ntown, who were engaged in occupations of a totally different kind.\r\n\r\n3. That tobacco, far from producing, in those who prepare it, death and\r\nnarcotism, does not even influence their nervous system; and that\r\nvertigo, syncope, muscular tremor, convulsions, and other like evils,\r\nwhich have been charged against it, have never existed in the\r\nmanufactories, though the men sleep in the midst of the most subtil\r\npreparations, or, at least, are not to be attributed to that cause.\r\n\r\n4. Not only is the tobacco without any effect on the health during the\r\nfirst years devoted to its preparation, it has not the least ill\r\nconsequences in more advanced life. Feebleness and great age, or causes\r\naltogether accidental, have been the sole ground for dismissing the\r\nworkmen.\r\n\r\n5. There are some professions which, without destroying health in an\r\nevident manner, abridge life; but a great number of those who work on\r\ntobacco reach, and even surpass, the ordinary limit of human existence.\r\n\r\n6. It is proved by innumerable facts, that the manufactories of tobacco\r\nare not in anywise injurious to the men, animals, or plants, which may\r\nexist in their vicinity.\r\n\r\nIt thus turns out, upon examination, that this much maligned substance\r\nis perfectly innocuous. “Yet what practitioner,” say MM. Parent\r\nDuchâtelet and D’Arcet, “who had not had occasion to visit the workshops\r\nand study their influence, would not be forced into belief by the\r\nimposing authorities we have quoted above; who of them would hesitate to\r\nregard as demonstrated opinions on which Ramazzini, Fourcroy, Cadet\r\nGassicourt, Tourtelle, Percy, Patissier, Merat and others are unanimous,\r\nwithout a single person having uttered a contrary assertion? There are\r\nfound among these authorities two members of the Royal Academy of\r\nMedicine, three members of the Academy of Sciences, two professors of\r\nthe Faculty of Medicine of Paris, one professor of the Faculty of\r\nMedicine of Strasbourg, two chemists, and two celebrated physicians—one\r\nFrench, the other Italian; in a word, six physicians and an apothecary,\r\nwho held, and still hold, the most eminent places in the learned world.\r\nIt is therefore evident that it is of the highest importance that trades\r\nand professions should be investigated differently from what they have\r\nhitherto been; and this importance daily increases, because of the\r\nprogress and extension of arts and manufactures.”\r\n\r\n\r\n         18.—_On the Habitations of the Lower Orders of Paris._\r\n                                 No. 1.\r\n\r\nThe labouring classes are obliged to live in houses almost always\r\ndilapidated, insufficient, or unhealthy. Such is the lot of the poor man\r\nin all countries: the force of circumstances, the hard law of necessity,\r\ncompel it. Yet, if it is impossible to remedy completely this state of\r\nthings, may we not approximate to it, by building houses for every grade\r\nof the lower orders—not only of the honest poor, but of the debased and\r\ndepraved? It appears to me that these houses would have a double\r\nadvantage;—they would diminish the causes of public insalubrity, and\r\noffer to the honest and economical workman the means to procure a\r\nresidence equal to his necessities, and capable of producing in him the\r\ntaste for retirement and domestic peace so favourable to morals. It is\r\nespecially in this last point of view that the amelioration of the\r\ndwellings of the poor and laborious class is to be ranked among the\r\npreservatives against vicious habits.\r\n\r\nRent being one of the most important and indispensable domestic\r\nexpenses, the father of a family, pressed by other wants of the first\r\nnecessity, naturally seeks the least costly habitation. Now, these\r\nhabitations exist only in certain quarters, and in certain streets of\r\nthose quarters: they are old, ruined, and filthy. The proprietors, in\r\norder to tenant them, let the lodgings very low, and thus attract the\r\npoorer families. If these lodgings were healthy, if they were sufficient\r\nfor all the members of the family, there would be no room for censure;\r\nbut they are foul, badly lighted, and neither air-tight nor water-tight.\r\nThey are small, and as parents and children live and sleep in the same\r\nroom, the overcrowding is both a cause of unhealthiness, and an offence\r\nagainst good morals. Moreover, the bad state and filth of the passages,\r\nprivies, and sinks, give rise to infectious exhalations, which vitiate\r\nthe air of these humble abodes, and affect the health of their\r\ninhabitants in a manner so much more mischievous that the greater part\r\nof them work all the day in crowded and ill-ventilated shops.\r\n\r\nIt would be worthy of a wise administration to remedy this dangerous\r\ncomplication. The task is doubtless difficult; but why not grapple with\r\nit boldly, instead of allowing to subsist in Paris, without any effort\r\nto destroy them, so many centres of infection which reduce to the level\r\nof the lowest animals the unfortunate beings who seek in them a retreat\r\nfor the night.\r\n\r\nAlthough the lodgings are not all repulsive, they are all alike open to\r\ncriticism. Some offend by overcrowding, others by the mode of sleeping;\r\nothers, lastly, by the absence of all ventilation, and even by a total\r\nwant of air. Overcrowding is an evil which prevails in all the lodgings\r\nof the lowest class, and which aggravates the mischief resulting from\r\nthe other inconveniences to which they are subject. The twenty-five or\r\nthirty thousand workmen employed in house-building, who flock to Paris\r\nevery year from certain departments, congregate in chambers, and sleep\r\nthere during the season. Many of these places are kept by countrymen of\r\ntheir own, who attract them by their known probity, and the kindness\r\nthey entertain for them. These chambers abound principally in the\r\nquarter of the Hôtel-de-Ville for the masons, and in the Faubourg\r\nSaint-Martin for the carpenters. These excellent workmen, by an\r\nexception more peculiar to them than to any others, look only to\r\neconomy. They bargain with the lodging-house keeper, so as to obtain for\r\nsix francs a month, besides the room, the washing of a shirt a-week, and\r\na mess of soup every day, for which they themselves provide the bread.\r\nAll that is not devoted to their slender wants is laid by for the\r\nsupport of their family, or the increase of their little patrimony. The\r\npolice unanimously testify to the order and concord which reign in their\r\nchambers, as well as to their good conduct abroad. Is it not mournful\r\nthat these fine fellows should sleep thus piled up in little garrets?\r\nAccustomed to work in the open air, the smallness of their rooms is more\r\ntrying to them than to any others. Thus typhus fever is common among\r\nthem, and sometimes attacks a whole chamber.\r\n\r\nThe overcrowding and deficient ventilation are still more injurious to\r\nworkmen employed in manufactures. They pass every day from an infected\r\nlodging into a shop which is usually as unwholesome, and they are thus\r\npredisposed to contract readily contagious maladies.\r\n\r\nOf all the lower orders, the chiffonniers inhabit the most infected and\r\ndisgusting lodgings. It is vain to expect to descend into the lowest\r\nranks of society,—inequality always appears somewhere. Even the\r\nchiffonniers have their notables. There are some a little more\r\neconomical, a little more raised than the mass, and who enjoy a certain\r\ncomfort. Those the most elevated occupy one or two small rooms, which\r\nthey hire for themselves and their families; others possess a pallet,\r\nwhich serves them to sleep on, in the chamber of which they are one\r\noccupant among many. But this possession is more often collective than\r\npersonal; and although shared, it does not fail to excite the envy of\r\nthe poor wretches who lie in a species of trough, on rags, or on\r\nhandsful of straw, with which the room is strewed. The police charged\r\nwith the surveillance of the lodgings inhabited by the chiffonniers give\r\nan incredible picture of them. Each occupant keeps by him his basket,\r\nsometimes full of filth—and what filth! These savages do not hesitate to\r\ncomprise dead animals in their gleanings, and pass the night by the side\r\nof this stinking prey. When the police go to these places, they\r\nexperience a suffocating feeling, bordering on asphyxy. They order the\r\nwindows to be opened when they can be opened, and the severe\r\nrepresentations they address to the lodging-house keepers on this\r\nhorrible mixture of human beings with decayed animal matter does not\r\nmove them. They answer, that their lodgers are accustomed to it as well\r\nas themselves. A trait of manners peculiar to the chiffonniers, and\r\nwhich might be called their pastime, consists in rat-catching in the\r\ncourts of the houses which they frequent. They entice the rats by the\r\naid of certain substances attached to the rags they gather in the\r\nstreets. With this view they put heaps of rags near the holes in the\r\nwalls, and when they think that the rats are buried in the rags, they\r\nlet loose into the court dogs trained for the purpose, and, in the\r\ntwinkling of an eye, they make themselves masters of the rats, of which\r\nthey eat the flesh and sell the skin.\r\n\r\nThe lodgings which receive at night the scum of society are thorough\r\npest-houses. Those even which are not frequented by chiffonniers become,\r\nby the crowding of the inhabitants and their filthy habits, dangerous\r\ncentres of infection. There are some chambers which contain as many as\r\nnine beds, separated by small passages hardly wide enough to get\r\nthrough, and these beds are often occupied by two persons who do not\r\nknow each other, and have never seen one another. Difference of sex is\r\nno obstacle to these nocturnal and fortuitous cohabitations, although\r\nthe police neglect nothing to prevent disorders. Among the female\r\napartments there is one which is famous for the picture of decrepitude\r\nand abjectness which it presents. The women who occupy it are old\r\ndrunkards, of whom several are suspected of theft. The spectacle of\r\nthese animated mummies has something sepulchral.\r\n\r\nOne must bring to social anatomy a serious spirit of investigation, to\r\nform a just idea of the population which lives in the concealed recesses\r\nof society. The imagination, however fertile and daring, could never\r\nreach, in this matter, to the height of the reality: there is a\r\ncharacter, a physiognomy, a strangeness, which it is necessary to have\r\nseen in order to assume the responsibility of an historian. Let no one\r\ntax with romance the traits of manners nor the description of places\r\ncontained in this chapter. However softened by the reserve I have\r\nimposed on myself, they are not less true at bottom. I have sacrificed\r\nthe coarseness of the outline and colouring out of respect to decency.\r\nIt is the only infidelity of which I accuse myself. It is impossible not\r\nto feel the necessity to provide an efficacious remedy for a state of\r\nthings so contrary to the rights of humanity and civilization.[57]\r\n\r\n\r\n  19.—_On the Habitations and Lodgings of the Lower Orders of Paris._\r\n                                 No. 2.\r\n\r\nThere exist in Paris some thousands of individuals who have no\r\ndomicile—who sleep to-day in one place, the next day in another—and who\r\nhave recourse every evening to those houses where, for a payment usually\r\nvery moderate, they can at least obtain a place to lie in, and a\r\ncovering for their heads. It is not only strangers living temporarily in\r\nParis who lodge in this manner; a mass of workmen, mostly single men,\r\nwho have not stirred from the capital for ten, fifteen, and twenty\r\nyears, prefer this kind of life to the occupation of a separate chamber.\r\nIt may be affirmed, without fear of contradiction, that this population\r\ncomprises all that is most drunken and debased in society. It is\r\ncomposed of people without foresight, and without a home, living from\r\nday to day, and trusting to the hospitals in the case of sickness or\r\ninfirmity. It is in the lowest places in these disgusting haunts in\r\nwhich a person is lodged for six, four, and even for two sous, that the\r\ngreater part of the prostitutes reside, who can scarcely, after\r\npurchasing food, lay aside from their daily gains the trifling sum\r\nnecessary to avert sleeping in the open air. I have visited some of\r\nthese lodgings, and it was not without a feeling of pain that I have\r\nseen human creatures reduced to live in such places, and that in the\r\ncapital of France. To give a just idea of these abodes, I will extract\r\nsome passages from the remarkable report which the inspector-general of\r\nfurnished lodgings addressed to the prefect of police at the time of the\r\ncholera. It tells of nothing but houses in ruin, of straw for beds in a\r\nstate of putrefaction, of darkness, of infectious smells, of filth\r\nwithout example. These are some of the passages:—\r\n\r\n“Rue ——, No. —. This house is remarkable for its excessive dirt. It is a\r\ngenuine centre of infection. It is inhabited solely by thieves,\r\nsmugglers, beggars, and prostitutes. It is impossible to enter without\r\nbeing suffocated.\r\n\r\n“Rue ——, No. —. This house fixes the attention by its construction and\r\nfilth. There are no beds, except some loathsome pallets; animal remains,\r\nintestines, and the refuse of meals, are rotting in the court; all the\r\nchambers look on a corridor completely deprived of air and light; the\r\nsinks and the privies of every story are loathsome from ordure and fecal\r\nmatter. It is the hideous abode of vice and misery.\r\n\r\n“Rue ——, No. —. The court of this house is four feet square, and is full\r\nof dung; the chambers, crowded with occupants, open on it; the privies,\r\ndilapidated to the fifth floor, let the fecal matter fall upon the\r\nstaircase, which is covered with it to the bottom. Many of the rooms\r\nhave no other aperture than the door which opens upon this staircase.\r\nThe house is the resort of sharpers, of thieves, of the most filthy\r\nprostitutes, and of everything that is most abject both of men and\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n“Rue du Faubourg ——, No. —. A house occupied from top to bottom by\r\nchiffonniers, mendicants, street-organists, street-walkers, and Italian\r\nboys, who go about with animals. All these sleep upon rags picked from\r\nthe street, and of which there is a depôt on the ground-floor. More\r\ncomplete abjectness it is impossible to witness.\r\n\r\n“Rue ——, No. —. This house is the resort of all that is most abased. It\r\nis exclusively inhabited by thieves, prostitutes, discharged criminals,\r\nbeggars, vagabonds, gamesters, and every species of rogues. The greatest\r\nfilth reigns everywhere; the windows are made of oiled paper instead of\r\nglass; the rooms are infected; at each story the ordure of the privies\r\nflows upon the staircase.”[58]\r\n\r\nAnother French writer, M. Frégier, has given the following description\r\nof the external appearance of these abodes:—“The streets, not, at\r\nfarthest, more than eight feet wide, are dirty, and flanked by lofty\r\nhouses, four stories high, which are blackened by time. The height of\r\nthe houses renders the streets gloomy and damp, and the houses\r\nthemselves are dark, particularly on the ground-floor. Spirit shops,\r\nbeer shops, and low eating houses abound. The gloom of these shops,\r\njoined to the repulsive physiognomy of the streets, infuse a secret\r\nhorror into the visitor who is led there by the spirit of observation,\r\nand who knows that the greater part of the shops are the habitual resort\r\nof the lowest prostitutes, and of rogues that live in the neighbourhood.\r\nThe lodgings and places of dissipation frequented by this part of the\r\npopulation are worthy, from their filth, of the streets and quarters in\r\nwhich they are situated.”[59]\r\n\r\n\r\n20.-_Extract from the Report of the Commission appointed by the Central\r\n Board of Public Health to ascertain the Condition of the Dwellings of\r\n    the Working Classes in Brussels, and to suggest Means for their\r\n                             Improvement._\r\n\r\nOur inquiries have led us more particularly into the most populous and\r\nmiserable districts into which the working classes are continually\r\ncrowding, in proportion as new and elegant buildings have encroached\r\nupon the districts within the heart of the capital, formerly almost\r\nexclusively occupied by those classes. We have visited successively, in\r\nthe district of _Minimes_, the _rue des Pignons_, and _de la\r\nSamaritane_, the _cul-de-sac des Minimes_, the alley _des Prêtres_, _les\r\nrues de l’Epris_, _du Bourreau_, _de la Oventail_, &c.; in the district\r\n_de la Chapelle_, _les rues des Ménages_, _du Radro_, _de la Rasière_,\r\n_des Rats_, _du Renard_, &c.; in the district _de la rue d’Anderlecht_,\r\n_la rue des Navets_, and the alley _au Lait_. We entered into a great\r\nnumber of the dwellings. We not only inquired, but also inspected, in\r\norder that we might ascertain the truth of the statements which were\r\nmade to us. In now presenting the results of this inquiry, we do not\r\nhesitate to call your attention to the very important facts which have\r\nbeen gathered, at the same time that we ask your indulgence for the\r\nimperfect manner in which we have been able to perform the duties\r\ncommitted to our zeal and exertions.\r\n\r\nThe misery of the localities we have visited struck us immediately, from\r\ntheir appearance of uniform poverty. The streets and alleys, at all\r\ntimes dirty and ill-paved, in times of rain or thaw had the appearance\r\nof a pestilential mire; the water had no means of running off, and the\r\nsmallness of the passages, the absence of courts or gardens, the\r\ncrowding of families, and the detestable modes of building, rendered all\r\ncirculation of air or ventilation quite impossible. The most\r\nindispensable conveniences were entirely wanting in most of the houses.\r\nThey had no pumps, nor privies, nor sewers, except one in common.\r\nIndeed, we saw seventy houses that were provided with only one pump or\r\none privy for the whole of that number.\r\n\r\nIf you enter the houses, the spectacle which is there presented to your\r\nview is, if anything, still more wretched. If the arrangement and order\r\nto be seen in some of the rooms recall the proverbial neatness of the\r\nFlemish, on the other hand, the houses occupied by large families, the\r\nalleys, the passages, and the stairs, are generally disgustingly filthy;\r\nthe brush of the whitewasher never passes along them, or if they are\r\never cleaned, it is only to attract new tenants, who soon restore them\r\nto their primitive dirtiness. The steepness of the stairs, which,\r\nindeed, are often more like ladders, must be a perpetual cause of\r\naccidents, especially to the young children. The space occupied by a\r\nfamily is generally much too confined for each of the members to receive\r\nthe quantity of fresh air necessary for the preservation of health.\r\nHence their appearance is generally that of suffering and of bad\r\ncondition. The children are pale and emaciated, and bear all the visible\r\nsigns of premature suffering. The number of those who are rickety and\r\nscrofulous is considerable, and the mortality amongst the children and\r\nthe aged exceeds all the most unfavourable averages. As we pass along\r\nthese receptacles of misery, we feel astonished to see so few old\r\npeople; an early death has carried them beyond their wretchedness: and\r\nif inquiries are made of parents, there are few who have not lost one or\r\nmore children. It would be important to compare the proportion of deaths\r\nin the families of the rich and of the indigent. There is little doubt\r\nthat this comparison would prove that misery, the want of proper air and\r\nspace, the occupations of these people, and privations of every sort,\r\nsensibly diminish the period of life of the working classes.\r\n\r\nIn these wretched habitations everything is sacrificed generally to the\r\nrapacity of the proprietor. Every repair which affects the health or the\r\ncomfort of the tenant merely, and that is not necessary to prevent the\r\ntotal ruin of the dwelling, is entirely neglected. What is the use of\r\ncleaning the walls for people whose habits are filthy? Why make windows\r\nfor the entrance of air and light, or repair a sewer, or cleanse an\r\nalley covered with stagnant water, for people who are accustomed to\r\npestilential smells? It is what a proprietor can never understand. Do\r\nnot believe, however, that these dreadful abodes are rented at their\r\nproper value. On the contrary, the unfortunate people obliged to live in\r\nthese houses, because all better ones are closed against them, in\r\nreality pay a higher rent than for a wholesome room in a good house.\r\n\r\n\r\n21. _Principles of Sanitary Police in Germany. Extracts from Professor_\r\n                                 MOHL.\r\n\r\nIt is one important duty of a State to provide abundant supplies of\r\nwater for its people; and this duty is based on the impossibility, in\r\nmany cases, for individuals by their own exertions to procure even the\r\nbarest necessary quantity of water, and also that it requires much skill\r\nto distinguish that which is of a good quality from that which is\r\ninjurious. The State ought, therefore, to provide water of the best\r\nquality in sufficient abundance, and to arrange also for its most\r\nextensive distribution: this is often attended with great difficulties\r\nand with much expense, if the district is naturally ill-supplied with\r\nsprings of water; or where a town, being large, requires more water than\r\nits own surface springs, or those of the immediate neighbourhood, can\r\nsupply. Without maintaining that the example given us by ancient\r\nnations, of munificent expenditure in the laying out of aqueducts, &c.,\r\nis one which we, therefore, are obliged to follow, yet it may be\r\ndemanded of the State, that it should provide water, at least so far as\r\nthe absolute wants of life require, by aqueducts or pipes, or at least\r\nby cisterns, laid down at the public expense. For the sake of the poorer\r\nclasses, it does not seem advisable that this duty should be handed over\r\nto a private company.[60]\r\n\r\nAn injudicious economy on this point affects most injuriously the habits\r\nof cleanliness, and consequently the health of the lower classes. Water\r\nis properly distributed when every district is provided with an\r\nabundance of springs or wells. Loss of time, danger of fire,\r\ndifficulties in the time of contagious diseases, are the consequences of\r\nthe wells being few in number, even though each one should furnish a\r\nlarge stream of water.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact, that locality has a great effect on the life\r\nand health of the inhabitants, and especially according as it offers the\r\nmeans of proper circulation of air or not. Thus, elevated situations are\r\ngenerally more healthy than places shut in by hills. In towns, those\r\nparts which are traversed by broad streets, are always more healthy than\r\nthose which are so closely covered with houses as never to be properly\r\nventilated, or where the sun can never penetrate to dry up the moisture;\r\nbut an ill-drained situation is the most injurious to health.\r\n\r\nThe healthiness of a whole town is often essentially improved by the\r\nformation of a single sewer or drain: in other places, it requires very\r\nextended operations to produce the same effect. We may include amongst\r\nthe various influences, the ditches surrounding the cities filled with\r\nstagnant water; by draining these, not only a purer air is gained, but\r\nalso a fertile piece of land. It ought to be remarked here, however,\r\nthat this work of draining water, and the removal of the mud, ought to\r\nbe done in the cold season; if not, dangerous fevers will in all\r\nprobability be the consequence.\r\n\r\nThe foul air arising from marshy land, when that is necessary, as in the\r\ncultivation of rice, is an evil for which there is no remedy.[61]\r\n\r\nAnother means of improving the healthiness of a town, is by proper\r\nattention to the breadth, and to the direction of the streets in all the\r\nnew quarters of the town. The streets ought to intersect, each other at\r\nright angles, and not at too great distances: the direction of the\r\nstreets, also, should not run due north and south, as in that case the\r\nstreets lying parallel in one direction, would be scorched by the sun,\r\nand without any shade during mid-day; whilst the streets running at\r\nright angles to these, would never be warmed by a ray of sunshine.\r\n\r\nThe health of towns would also be much improved by the prohibition of\r\nall cellars as dwelling-houses, by legislative enactments as to the\r\nelevation of the ground-floor of dwelling-houses above the level of the\r\nstreets, also as to the construction of proper conveniences attached to\r\ndwelling-houses; and by regulations with regard to the proper size of\r\nwindows: also by regulations regarding the strictest cleanliness of the\r\nstreets, as this is more important in its effects on the health\r\ngenerally, than even the situation of a town, or attention to its mode\r\nof building. By attention to it, Holland is inhabitable; by the neglect\r\nof it, Cairo and Constantinople are the very hot-beds of the plague.\r\n\r\nThe first means to attain this cleanliness is by a proper paving of all\r\nthe streets, in order to lay the district dry. Without this, the streets\r\nare either a stream of mud, or a sea of dust; in both cases equally\r\ninjurious to the health. It is often expensive to get a hard material\r\nfor the purpose of pavement; but when obtained, the expense of keeping\r\nit in repair is much less. When it is possible, the streets should be\r\nkept clean, by turning on them a stream of water,—the drains being\r\nalways kept well open to receive it afterwards. Every inhabitant should\r\nbe obliged to keep the portion of the street clean before his own door.\r\nThe refuse of the town ought to be conveyed away, at the expense of the\r\ntown, to some part of the country, removed from all dwelling-houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n  22.—_A Report on the Statements of Dr. Mauthner regarding the Cotton\r\nManufactures, given at the Monthly Meeting on the 2nd of November, 1841.\r\n                       By_ Herr L. M. VON PACHER.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the 7th of June, Dr. Mauthner sent in a report on the\r\ncondition of the children employed in the cotton-works, in which he gave\r\nan exposition of the evidence, partly of his own experience and partly\r\non the reports of others, of the moral and physical evils which the\r\nvarious branches of manufacture bring with them, and proposals were put\r\ninto the hands of the owners of the mills for preventing the evils so\r\nstrongly denounced.\r\n\r\nThe learned meeting determined to appoint a special commission to\r\ninquire into so grave and important a matter. This body held its first\r\nmeeting on the 29th of July, at which our much-esteemed chairman\r\npresided, and I had the honour to be commissioned to inquire into that\r\npart of the report of Dr. Mauthner which treats more particularly of the\r\neffects of the cotton manufactures.\r\n\r\nBefore I enter upon the discussion on the special points of inquiry,\r\npermit me to lay before you a few general remarks on the nature of our\r\ninquiry, and of the condition of the people employed in the\r\ncotton-works, more particularly of Lower Austria. It must first be\r\nconceded that the condition of the children working in the factories is\r\nclosely connected with the condition of the rest of the working\r\npopulation, and cannot be considered separately. Our president felt the\r\nnecessity of considering them in connexion throughout the various parts\r\nof the inquiry which he had proposed to himself; and, before the\r\ncommencement of our inquiry, it was generally agreed that our attention\r\nshould extend also to the condition of the adult workpeople.\r\n\r\nWe could not conceal from ourselves that we were undertaking a subject\r\nat once the most important and the most delicate,—an inquiry which might\r\ndisclose to the general public that the unhappy signs of the times were\r\nto be seen in our affairs, and which also, without cause, might alarm a\r\nvery excitable class as to their own condition. English and French\r\njournals are full of the most striking descriptions of the physical and\r\nmoral evils of the manufacturing population; and not without ground, as\r\nwe learn from the various commissions of inquiry appointed by the\r\nrespective governments. With your permission I will quote a passage from\r\na report which the Commission de l’Intendance Sanataire du Nord drew up\r\nin the year 1832, and which unfortunately has not been found exaggerated\r\neven in later periods. It is word for word as follows:—\r\n\r\n“No one without personal inspection can form any conception of the\r\ndwellings of our workpeople: the neglect in which they live brings evils\r\nwith it which makes their misery unbearable, indeed almost fatal. Their\r\npoverty, by the negligence and demoralization which produces it, becomes\r\nalmost destructive. In their dark cellars, in their cellar-like rooms,\r\nthe air is never changed; it is perfectly poisonous. The walls are\r\ncovered with filth. If a bed is ever found, it is always filthy, and\r\nmade up of foul and rotten straw. It is covered with a coarse and dirty\r\nrag, the colour or material of which can hardly be distinguished; it is\r\na miserable threadbare coverlet. The dirty and worm-eaten pieces of\r\nfurniture and utensils are thrown about without any order; the closed\r\nwindows scarcely allow any light to pass through their smoky panes, many\r\nof which are stuffed with paper, and (it will hardly be credited) they\r\nnot unfrequently nail the window fast in order that it may run no risk\r\nof being broken in the opening and shutting of it. The floors of their\r\nhouses are dirtier than the rest of the house, covered with ordure,\r\nashes, rotten straw, and all that has been brought in from the filthy\r\nstreets outside; it is a receptacle for every kind of vermin. The air is\r\nno longer fit to breathe; one feels in these abodes stunned with an\r\noverpowering and horrible stench, a smell of excrement, filth of every\r\nkind, and of human beings. And the inhabitant of these abodes, in what\r\nstate is he? His clothes are in rags, and tossed on. His hair has never\r\nknown a comb, and is covered with the material with which he is working;\r\nand his skin, though filthy, is yet distinguishable on his face, but on\r\nthe other part of his body, concealed by his rags, there are\r\naccumulations of every kind. Nothing is so fearfully dirty as the old\r\nand wrinkled of these demoralised creatures. Their abdomens distended,\r\ntheir limbs distorted, their backs bent forward, their legs twisted,\r\ntheir necks scarred and full of swellings, their fingers festered, their\r\njoints swollen and weak, and, lastly, these unfortunate creatures are\r\ntormented, we may say eaten up, with vermin of all kinds.”\r\n\r\nThese descriptions were given by M. de Chambert, Boglli, Brigaudet,\r\nKulman, and Themistocles Lestibuwers. I shall be excused for having\r\ngiven this long and disgusting extract, as it shows clearly what was the\r\nstate and the evils which could call forth those general and loud\r\ncomplaints, and which made it a duty for government to take the matter\r\ninto consideration. The whole picture is too wretched to be brought into\r\nthe most distant comparison with the condition of the poorest of our\r\nworkpeople, who are in general well fed and decently clothed, and show\r\nin the furniture of their cleanly-kept houses the fruits of their small\r\nearnings. They, together with their children, enjoy excellent health,\r\nand in general deserve the character of being a sober, industrious,\r\norderly, tractable, and attached class. But a large population of\r\nworkpeople, living entirely on the daily labour of their hands, wanting\r\nmany things in external circumstances which, to the eye accustomed to\r\nluxury and abundance, are considered indispensable, under the continual\r\npressure of strict regulations and continuous labour, is not a very\r\nenviable picture to the superficial observer, and often gives occasion\r\nto many unfounded lamentations and ill-timed apprehensions, if not to\r\none-sided measures, which are, however, powerless against the stern\r\nnecessity of supporting thousands of human beings, which are disturbing\r\nwhen they shake the established order of things, and are destructive\r\nwhen they make a happy and quiet class of workpeople discontented with\r\ntheir lot.\r\n\r\nThe cotton-works in Lower Austria, which are almost all situated within\r\na circle of a few miles around Vienna, employ about 10,000 hands, for\r\nwhose accommodation solid and roomy dwellings have been erected for the\r\nmost part at the same time as the works were established.\r\n\r\nMost of the mills have not only a considerable number of dwellings for\r\nthe married workers, but large, separate sleeping-rooms for the\r\nunmarried of both sexes, which are provided with beds, and lighted and\r\nwarmed at the expense of the mill. When the larger and older mills were\r\nbuilt, there was erected for the boys and girls a so-called children’s\r\nhouse, in which, at that time, the children were provided at the expense\r\nof the mill with food, clothes, and instruction, and who were bound by\r\ncertain regulations issued by the government, and were placed under the\r\ninspection of the respective clergyman and physician of the district.\r\nAfter the works were extended, they found they were obliged to give up\r\nthese institutions; and they now drew the requisite number of hands,\r\npartly from the descendants of their own people, and partly from the\r\nchildren of the country people, who, in the course of time, becoming\r\ninformed as to the condition of the children in the factories, send\r\ntheir own children after they are too big for home employment and to go\r\nto school, to work in the mills for a certain number of years; after\r\nwhich, however, they generally return to their agricultural labour. On\r\nthe confines of Hungary, on a Sunday evening, hundreds of young, robust,\r\nand healthy workpeople, carrying with them the provisions for the week,\r\nmay be seen coming to the mill, whence, on the Saturday evening, they\r\nmay be seen going in merry groups carrying their wages back to their own\r\nhomes. For these, and all who do not live with their parents, decent and\r\nproper rooms are provided, sometimes in that which used to be the\r\nchildren’s house, or in other places equally under inspection.\r\n\r\nThe employment in cotton mills, and more especially of the children,\r\nrequires attention, and a certain quickness or sleight of hand more than\r\nany bodily exertion. The whole of the hands are employed in roomy and\r\nlight apartments, which in summer are well ventilated, and in winter\r\nwarmed with great regularity, and there is nothing in the material, nor\r\nin the processes of the manufacture, which can be injurious to the\r\nhealth. The hours of work, which are generally from four to five in the\r\nmorning to seven or eight in the evening, are interrupted by three\r\nmeal-times; and on Saturday the mill is closed from three to four hours\r\nearlier. The weekly wages of boys and girls are from 3 to 5 florins, and\r\nthose of the adults from 6 to 18, besides a house free; and it is not\r\nonly sufficient for their wants, but gives them also the means of laying\r\nby a little saving, examples of which are not unfrequent.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the health is not, and cannot be, anything\r\nelse than extremely good; the large number of old who are still robust\r\nand in employment, the experience and evidence of all the physicians who\r\npractise amongst the mill population, the result of the reports of the\r\ndistrict physician, but above all, the healthy state they were in during\r\nseveral epidemics, and also the small proportion of deaths as seen in\r\nthe parish register, all afford the most striking evidence of the fact\r\nof their healthiness. Every noxious circumstance must undoubtedly bear\r\nwith it the traces of its evil; street riots, mobs of workpeople, and\r\nexcesses of all kinds, breaches of the law and criminal acts, numerous\r\nand open concubinage, large numbers of illegitimate children (in many\r\nmanufacturing towns amounting to one-fourth of the whole births), and,\r\nlastly, the large numbers of entirely destitute and disabled workpeople\r\nwho seek for assistance from the parish and from all charities; these\r\nare the melancholy signs which mark in England and France the state of\r\nthe manufacturing population.\r\n\r\nIn the course of 40 years, during which the Austrian manufactures have\r\narisen so near to the capital, and have been well watched by the police,\r\nsuch moral and physical deterioration of so large a population could not\r\nhave escaped notice; but I ask where are those incontrovertible signs\r\nwhich an hospital or a workhouse more frequently attended or applied to\r\nby the mill population than by any other poor class of the community\r\nwould be? where are those prevailing diseases? where is the increased\r\nmortality? and, lastly, where are the traces of moral and mental\r\ndegradation? Certainly it would be unjust to throw the stone at those\r\nwho have linked with the unavoidable demands of business circumstances\r\nwhich might be measured by the scale of a more fortunate and independent\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nDr. Mauthner states, “that the weakness of the body and constitution of\r\nthe children employed in the great cotton-works in the neighbourhood is\r\nvery striking.\r\n\r\n“1st. That the race of men employed in those establishments is much less\r\nrobust than that of the peasantry of the neighbouring villages.\r\n\r\n“2nd. That bauchscropheln and scrophuleuse consumption are not uncommon;\r\nthat inflammatory diseases are very rare.\r\n\r\n“3rd. That premature old age and early death is the common fate.”\r\n\r\nEven supposing that since the establishment of the spinning-works there\r\ncould have been created a peculiar race of people, still the supposition\r\ncould not prove more than that the constitution of the workers had been\r\nmodified by their employment and their mode of living, since experience\r\nshows that the duration of life is not shorter than that of the other\r\nworking classes.\r\n\r\n2dly. That the above-mentioned diseases principally affect children of\r\nthe earliest age, the former about the fifth year, the last about the\r\nseventh year; and that it is to be premised that the children who never\r\nwork in the mill before their ninth year, come sometimes with the\r\ndisease already developed upon them. The children of the mill hands are,\r\nindeed, less attacked by this disease than the children of the poor\r\nagricultural labourer, because they are generally better housed and\r\nclothed than these. That inflammatory diseases seldom appear is no sign\r\nof a weak constitution, since, on the one hand, these seldom appear\r\namongst children; and, on the other hand, they do show themselves\r\namongst the adults, whenever there are external influences and inducing\r\ncircumstances to produce them; and all the physicians practising in the\r\ncotton-works agree in stating that, with the exception of rheumatic\r\naffections, there are no peculiar forms of disease amongst the\r\ncotton-spinning population.\r\n\r\n3rdly. As to the statement of premature old age and early deaths, it is\r\none which is contradicted by all the experience of half a century. The\r\nregisters of deaths made by the clergymen of the parishes give the most\r\nexact information as to the proportion of deaths. The results of these\r\nare,\r\n\r\n1st. That the number of deaths, especially amongst the manufacturing\r\npeople, is proportionally less than amongst the agricultural labourers;\r\n\r\n2nd. That, as amongst other classes, the deaths are the most numerous of\r\nchildren under two years;\r\n\r\n3rd. That between the age of 12 and 16 there are the fewest deaths;\r\n\r\n4th. That there are a great many between 60 and 70.\r\n\r\nThe means proposed by Dr. Mauthner for obtaining a better physical and\r\nmoral state are,\r\n\r\n1st. Shortening the hours of labour;\r\n\r\n2ndly. Interrupting the hours of labour by school instruction: on both\r\nwhich points there could be no discussion, since these are already\r\nprovided for by the law.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the long working hours, which certainly appear very\r\noppressive to the unemployed spectator, long habit has accustomed the\r\nworkers to them, and they do not produce any perceptible injury, more\r\nespecially as the people are paid in proportion to the time they are\r\nemployed. It is to be remembered that there remain eight hours for rest,\r\nnone of which are spent in going and coming to their homes, as is the\r\ncase in other countries, as, for instance, in Mulhausen, where one-third\r\nof the workers live from one to two miles from the mill.\r\n\r\nIt is not during the hours of well-regulated and orderly employment that\r\nthere is any danger of demoralization, but during the leisure hours.\r\nVillermé, in his valuable work on the _Etat Physique et Morale des\r\nOuvriers_, states that the moral and physical deterioration of the\r\nmanufacturing class in Rheims, where they only work from 10 to 12 hours,\r\nis most striking. The hours of work being ended, the people fill the\r\ntaverns and the streets with prostitutes, whilst the workers from the\r\nnumerous manufactories of Sedan, who work 15 hours, are sober, moral,\r\nand orderly. He mentions also that few manufactories employ so many\r\nrobust hands as the spinning works at Sedan.\r\n\r\n3dly. To employ more than one spinner to attend to a new spinning\r\nmachine which turns a greater number of spindles.\r\n\r\nIt would in general be well to trust to the manufacturer the number of\r\nworkers he should employ, as his interest compels him to use a requisite\r\nnumber of hands. In this particular case it ought to be stated that,\r\nowing to the progress of machinery, the spinner having 800 or 1000\r\nspindles has less labour than formerly, when he had only 300 spindles to\r\nattend to.\r\n\r\n4thly. That the children, and mill hands generally, should be kept in\r\ngood order, by sick funds and savings’ banks.\r\n\r\nIn most works there is established a kind of sick fund, to which each\r\nhand contributes weekly from 1 to 2 _kr._ for every guilder they earn;\r\nor there are voluntary contributions to those who are invalided; or,\r\nlastly, when they receive medical advice gratis, they have this fund to\r\nexpend in medicines. If this fund is sufficient to assist the sick, it\r\nis not enough to support those in old age, and they must of necessity\r\ndepend on that help which they are entitled to as being the fathers of\r\nfamilies; and indeed every country mill can count many families amongst\r\nthe workers in which an aged father or mother is supported by their\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nThe formation of regulations, binding on all and applicable to all\r\ncases, as to the employment of children in mills, together with all\r\nother regulations which affect the internal arrangements of a\r\nmanufactory, is incontestibly attended with many difficulties, and\r\nindeed one might say with insuperable obstacles. French legislation has\r\nemployed itself three years with this object. The law has appeared, and\r\nwe have read it in our public journals. In the leading principles it\r\ndoes not seem to contain anything but what has been in practice in\r\nAustria for many years, though of our proceedings in regard to minute\r\ndetails may be said what the minister of finance prognosticated in the\r\nChamber of Peers on the 31st May, 1837, when he said, “At different\r\ntimes government has felt the necessity of a similar law. It has\r\noccupied itself with it, and made every inquiry on the subject, but the\r\nlaw itself presents extreme difficulties: many countries have attempted\r\none; England has even passed a law on this subject, but it is not\r\nobserved.”\r\n\r\nThe interests of the children, it is repeated, have been protected by\r\nthe regulations issued by the government of Lower Austria, the last of\r\nwhich were issued on July 16, 1839. For the moral and mental development\r\nof the labourer in general there is only one great panacea: this lies in\r\nthe extension of trade, in the security and steadiness of employment,\r\nand in the power of the labourer to maintain himself and his children\r\ncomfortably and respectably with the work of his own hands.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that our manufacturers will progress in the gradual\r\nand prudent course which is equally removed from stupid and blind\r\nadherence to old things, as from the spirit of hasty imitation and the\r\nheadlong pursuit of novelties. We shall then not have to fear the\r\ncreation of a dissolute and depraved class of workpeople, as we see in\r\nother countries. For the rest, trust to the wise care of our\r\ngovernment—trust to the sound sense and excellent disposition of our\r\nlabourers—and, above all, trust something to the humanity and to the\r\nopinions of the manufacturers of Austria themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n           _Remarks on the Cotton Manufactory in Schwadorf._\r\n\r\nThere is here, under the superintendence of the master of the works, a\r\nsick-fund for the workpeople, to which every man, woman, and child\r\ntogether must contribute 1½ _xr._ kreutzer for every guilder they\r\nreceive in wages; for this they obtain not only for themselves, but also\r\nfor the members of their families who do not come to the mill (such as\r\nthe little children and the mothers), gratuitous medical advice and\r\nmedicines; and, further, the _men_, when they are prevented from coming\r\nto the mill by sickness, receive a 12–kreutzer per day.\r\n\r\nThe number of hands is on an average 170 men, 220 women and adult girls,\r\nand 100 children; total, 550 individuals.\r\n\r\nThe amount of contribution to the relief-fund was, in\r\n\r\n                     1839 f.380·4  per day 62 _xr._\r\n                     1840 f.410·56 per day 67 _xr._\r\n\r\nThough on an average from five to six men of the 170 employed are\r\nprevented from coming to their work, yet of these there are _four_ who\r\nhave received support from the fund, on account of the infirmities of\r\nage and incurable diseases, for many years; so that, on an average,\r\nthere is only from one to two who are prevented from coming to their\r\nwork by sickness.[62] A part of the above-mentioned 550 mill hands live\r\nin the adjacent district; these, when they cannot come to the medical\r\nman belonging to the factory, are attended by the surgeon of the\r\ndistrict; but then, on the other hand, there must be set against these\r\nthe members of the families who do not work at the mill, as\r\nabove-mentioned, and which are about equal in number. Indeed, the number\r\nof those coming for medical advice of the factory physician, and to\r\nwhich the following tables relate, may be from 600 to 700. The total\r\npopulation of Schwadorf is about 1700, of which, on an average of the\r\nlast 10 years, according to the parish register, 62 died annually. Of\r\nthese, according to the register kept by the factory physician, only 13,\r\non an average, were from the mill population; at least, as it appears in\r\nthe last seven years, during which the present physician has attended.\r\n\r\n                        Attended.

W.\r\n                     Over 9       daily 30 _xr._ W. W.\r\n\r\nThose Croatians who live in their houses do not receive any quota from\r\nthe sick-fund, but are, of course, attended. As to those who are out of\r\nthe district, they also receive medical advice gratis, if they can come\r\nto the factory physician, even though they do not contribute to the\r\nsick-fund. Only few have families, but these also, in case of sickness,\r\nreceive medical assistance.\r\n\r\nThe number of hands varies considerably from 200 to 300; on an average\r\nabout 250; of these may be,\r\n\r\n                    Men and adults               180\r\n                    Women                         20\r\n                    Children from 13 to 17 years  50\r\n\r\nThe total contribution to the relief-fund was, in the\r\n\r\n            Year 1839, W. W. fl. 190·48, or 31 _x._ per day.\r\n                 1840, W. W. fl. 250·50, or 41 _x._ per day.\r\n\r\nAlso on an average one or two individuals could not work on account of\r\nillness.\r\n\r\nTo both the spinning works of Herrn von Eltz and Herrn Roulet there is\r\nattached a sick-fund, the exact rules of which I am not acquainted with.\r\nIn the print-works of Dubois, Dupasquier, and Co., the printers have a\r\nsick-fund amongst themselves, out of which the hands in work assist\r\nthose who are unable to work, according to the circumstances. Since the\r\nhands in the screw-works are not, like the spinners, a steady, fixed\r\nclass of workers, but a more fluctuating class, since it often happens\r\nthat members of the same family are employed in different factories, and\r\nit is difficult to separate into heads the number of individuals who\r\nhave received medical aid; the annexed table for 1840 will give a\r\ntolerably correct view of the state of sickness in the various works,\r\nonly with regard however to the numbers working, leaving the other\r\nmembers of the family out of consideration. It is to be observed here,\r\nthat the physician by whom these statements have been drawn up is\r\nappointed exclusively to the screw-works and the two spinning\r\nmanufactories. The hands from the print-works go also to other\r\nphysicians, of whom there are several in Neunkirchen; hence is explained\r\nthe apparently small number of persons from the print-works who have\r\nreceived medical aid from him.\r\n\r\n                  Screw works of   Spinning works of  Print works of Von\r\n                Brevillier and Co.

amount of, produced among the Poor of\r\n          Liverpool from want of Ventilation and Cleanliness._\r\n\r\nThe typhus, or low contagious fever, prevails in all large cities and\r\ntowns to a degree that those are not aware of who have not turned their\r\nattention to the subject, or whose occupations do not lead them to mix\r\nwith the labouring poor. In Liverpool it has been supposed that this\r\ndisease is seldom to be met with; and it is certainly true, that the\r\nupper classes of the inhabitants are not often subjected to its ravages.\r\nWhen the extent to which it is constantly present among the poor shall\r\nbe proved by authentic documents, this circumstance will serve to\r\ndemonstrate the narrow sphere of the contagion, and to show how much it\r\nis within the limits of human power to lessen the frequency of the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nOf the inhabitants of Liverpool, it is ascertained that about 9500 live\r\nin cellars underground, and upwards of 9000 in back houses, which in\r\ngeneral have an imperfect ventilation, especially in the new streets on\r\nthe south side of the town, where a pernicious practice has been\r\nintroduced of building houses to be let to labourers, in small confined\r\ncourts, which have a communication with the street by a narrow aperture,\r\nbut no passage for the air through them. Among the inhabitants of the\r\ncellars and these back houses the typhus is constantly present; and the\r\nnumber of persons under this disease that apply for medical assistance\r\nto the charitable institutions, the public will be astonished to hear,\r\nexceeds, on an average, 3000 annually. For the ten years preceding 1797,\r\nthere were, on an average, 119 patients ill of fever constantly on the\r\nbooks of the dispensary. Of convalescents, unfit for labour, the average\r\nnumber will be nearly as great. Thus, in Liverpool, 240 of the poor may\r\nbe considered as constantly rendered incapable of earning their\r\nsubsistence by this single disease; and as the poor seldom lay up any\r\npart of their earnings for a season of sickness, the expense of their\r\nmaintenance must, in one form or other, fall on the public. If we take\r\nthis as low as 10_l._ for each, it will amount to 2400_l._ annually.\r\n\r\nThough the cure of this disease is a principal object of our charitable\r\ninstitutions in Liverpool, it is to be lamented that hitherto little or\r\nnothing has been done for its prevention. The infection arises from a\r\nwant of cleanliness and ventilation, and its influence is promoted by\r\ndamp, fatigue, sorrow, and hunger. A vigilant exercise of all the means\r\nof prevention might, in a short period, supersede the use of hospitals,\r\nby extinguishing the disease; a prospect in which the philanthropist\r\nmight more safely indulge, if he could calculate with the same\r\nconfidence on the wisdom as on the power of his species.[63]\r\n\r\n\r\n   24.—_Extract from Dr. Ferriar’s Advice to the Labouring Classes in\r\n                      Manchester; given in 1800._\r\n\r\nAvoid living in damp cellars; they destroy your constitutions and\r\nshorten your lives. No temptation of low rents can counterbalance their\r\nill effects. You are apt to crowd into the cellars of new buildings,\r\nsupposing them to be clean; this is a fatal mistake; a new house is\r\nalways damp for two years, and the cellars which you inhabit under them\r\nare generally as moist as the bottom of a well. In such places you are\r\nliable to bad fevers, which often throw the patient into a decline, and\r\nyou are apt to get rheumatic complaints, that continue for a long time\r\nand disable you from working.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot help taking a cellar, be attentive to have all the windows\r\nput in good repair before you venture into it, and, if possible, get it\r\nwhitewashed. If you attempt to live in a cellar with broken windows,\r\ncolds and fevers will be the certain consequences.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the town you sleep in back rooms, behind the front\r\ncellar, which are dark and have no proper circulation of air. It would\r\nbe much more healthy to sleep to the front; at least when you have large\r\nfamilies, which is often the case, you ought to divide them, and not to\r\ncrowd the whole together in the back cellar.\r\n\r\nKeep your persons and houses as clean as your employments will permit,\r\nand do not regret the loss of an hour’s wages when your time is occupied\r\nin attending to cleanliness. It is better to give up a little time\r\noccasionally to keep your houses neat, than to see your whole family\r\nlying sick in consequence of working constantly without cleaning. It\r\nwould be of great service if you could contrive to air your bed and\r\nbed-clothes out of doors once or twice a-week.\r\n\r\nAlways wash your children from head to foot with cold water before you\r\nsend them to work in the morning. Take care to keep them dry in their\r\nfeet, and never allow them to go to work without giving them their\r\nbreakfast, though you should have nothing to offer them but a crust of\r\nbread and a little water. Children who get wet feet, when they go out\r\nearly fasting, seldom escape fever or severe colds.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYour health will always be materially injured by the following\r\ncircumstances:—living in small back buildings, adjoining to the open\r\nvaults of privies; living in cellars where the streets are not properly\r\nsoughed or drained; living in narrow bye-streets where sheep are\r\nslaughtered, and where the blood and garbage are allowed to stagnate and\r\ncorrupt, and perhaps more than all, by living crowded together in dirty\r\nlodging-houses, where you cannot have the common comforts of light and\r\nair.\r\n\r\nIt should be unnecessary to remind you that much sickness is occasioned\r\namong you by passing your evenings at ale-houses, or in strolling about\r\nthe streets or in the fields adjoining to the town. Perhaps those who\r\nare most apt to expose themselves in this manner would pay little\r\nattention to dissuasive arguments of any kind; however, those who feel\r\nan interest in your welfare cannot omit making the remark.\r\n\r\n\r\n  25.—_Principles of Jurisprudence and Responsibility for Accidents._\r\n\r\n(_Extract from the First Report of the Commissioners of Inquiry into the\r\nLabour Children in Factories._)\r\n\r\nFrom the evidence collected, it appears that in many of the mills,\r\nnumerous accidents of a grievous nature do occur to the workpeople. It\r\nappears also that these accidents may be prevented, since in some mills\r\nwhere more care of the workpeople is in general displayed they are\r\nprevented. It appears further, that whilst some manufacturers liberally\r\ncontribute to the relief of the sufferers, many other manufacturers\r\nleave them to obtain relief from public bounty, or as they may.\r\n\r\nThe refusal to contribute to the expense of the cure of those who have\r\nbeen maimed is usually founded on the assertion that the accident was\r\noccasioned by culpable heedlessness or temerity. In the cases of the\r\nchildren of tender years, we do not consider this a valid defence\r\nagainst the claim for contribution from the employer. We cannot suppose\r\nan obligation to perpetual caution and discretion imposed on children at\r\nan age when those qualities do not usually exist. The indiscretion of\r\nchildren must, we consider, be presumed and guarded against as a thing\r\nthat must necessarily, and to a greater or less extent, be manifested by\r\nall of them.\r\n\r\nBut the accidents which occur to the adults, are of themselves evidence\r\n(unless they were wilfully incurred in a state of delirium) that the\r\nindividual used all the caution of which he is capable; as it may be\r\npresumed that the loss of life or limb, or the infliction of severe\r\npain, would rarely be wantonly incurred.\r\n\r\nSome of the manufacturers have proposed that the inspectors, who they\r\nthink ought to be appointed to insure compliance with any legislative\r\nregulation, should have power to inspect the factories, and direct what\r\nparts of the machinery should be fenced off, and that after such\r\ndirections have been complied with, the manufacturer should be relieved\r\nfrom further responsibility.\r\n\r\nWe concur in the proposition for giving such power to inspectors, but we\r\ndo not concur in the proposal to relieve the manufacturer from\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nWe apprehend that no inspector would probably be so fully conversant\r\nwith all the uses of every variety of machinery as to be acquainted with\r\nall the dangers which may be provided against; and also, that whilst\r\nthere is much machinery which does not, from its nature, admit of its\r\nbeing boxed off, there is much that could not be made entirely safe\r\nwithout the reconstruction of whole manufactories.\r\n\r\nExcluding from consideration the cases of culpable temerity on the part\r\nof the adults, and assuming that the aid to be given when accidents do\r\noccur shall afford no bounty on carelessness, the cases which remain for\r\nprovision are those of adults which may be considered purely accidental.\r\nTaking a case of this class, where mischief has occurred in the\r\nperformance of the joint business of the labourer and his employer; the\r\nquestion is, by which of these parties the pecuniary consequences of\r\nsuch mischief shall be sustained.\r\n\r\nWe conceive that it may be stated, as a principle of jurisprudence\r\napplicable to the cases of evils arising from causes which ordinary\r\nprudence cannot avert, that responsibility should be concentrated, or,\r\nas closely as possible, apportioned on those who have the best means of\r\npreventing the mischief. Unless we are to impose on the workman the\r\nobligation of perpetual care and apprehension of danger, the nature of\r\nthe injuries inflicted are of themselves evidence that all the care\r\nwhich can be taken by individuals attending to their work is taken by\r\nthem; it is only the proprietor of the machinery who has the most\r\neffectual means of guarding against the dangers attendant upon its use.\r\n\r\nIf such an extent of pecuniary responsibility for the accidents which\r\nare incidental to the use of the machines is imposed upon him, those\r\nconsequences will be more likely to be taken into account, and to be\r\nguarded against at the time of the erection of the machinery. The\r\nworkmen are not prone to regard immediate dangers, still less dangers\r\nwhich are remote and contingent, and many of the accidents are of a\r\nnature apparently too uncertain to form data for insurance. It could\r\nhardly be expected that a workman in entering a manufactory should\r\nobject that any portion of the machinery is dangerous, and that it ought\r\nto be boxed off. But the proprietor of the machine is necessarily the\r\nperson who can best foresee all the consequences incidental to its use,\r\nand can best guard against them. By throwing upon him a portion of the\r\npecuniary responsibility for those mischiefs, we combine interest with\r\nduty, and add to the efficiency of both.\r\n\r\nIf the pecuniary consequences from unavoidable accidents were\r\nconsiderable, the imposition of the proposed responsibility may be met\r\nby the master, or by a deduction from the wages. Considering the\r\ndefective nature of most existing modes of provision against sickness\r\nand casualties by benefit or friendly societies, and also, unhappily,\r\nthe large proportion of those who, from improvidence, do not take\r\nadvantage of these or other means, (of which some portion of the\r\nworking-class avail themselves in so exemplary and admirable a manner),\r\nif we were to devise a form of insurance against the casualties in\r\nquestion, available to all classes, we should recommend that measures\r\nshould be taken to secure from the master the regular deductions of the\r\namount of the contribution of the persons employed.\r\n\r\nWe propose that in the case of all accidents whatsoever from machinery\r\noccurring to children under fourteen years of age, the proprietor of the\r\nmachinery shall pay for the medical attendance on the child, and all the\r\nexpenses of the cure, until medical attendance is no longer required;\r\nand also during the same period, shall continue to pay wages at the rate\r\nof half the wages enjoyed by the individual in question at the time of\r\nthe occurrence of the accident.\r\n\r\nWe are of opinion that persons above that age, in all cases where the\r\ninjury was received from accidents in the ordinary course of business,\r\nwhere there was no culpable temerity, should receive similar treatment\r\nat the expense of the employer, and should also be allowed half wages\r\nuntil the period of cure, as we believe that an allowance of full wages\r\nwould occasion considerable fraud in the protraction of that period,\r\nespecially in the cases of accidents of a less serious nature.\r\n\r\nWe think that the remedy should be given on complaint before a\r\nmagistrate or the inspector.\r\n\r\n“With regard to fatal injuries occasioned by wilful negligence, we have\r\nat present no new remedies to suggest as substitutes to those afforded\r\nby the common law.”\r\n\r\n  [In a recent case, I believe in Scotland, 300_l._ damages were\r\n  recovered against the owner of an old mine for the loss of a child,\r\n  which had fallen into it accidentally from the opening not being\r\n  properly protected.\r\n\r\n  It is sometimes stated that the owners of mines already come within\r\n  the principle, that they are interested in prevention, inasmuch as\r\n  they incur loss from the stoppage of work and otherwise by accidents.\r\n  The fact, however, of no exertions being made for prevention might be\r\n  adduced as proof that the share of the loss was not sufficiently\r\n  great, and the interest therefore inadequate; but it will generally be\r\n  found that no share of the loss falls directly on the manager of the\r\n  works, and that the pecuniary consequences are so far diffused over\r\n  numerous partners as not to be felt, and that this is so particularly\r\n  in works or machinery belonging to joint-stock companies.\r\n\r\n  In Prussia, as well as Austria, deductions are required by the law to\r\n  be made from the wages of the men engaged in mining operations, which\r\n  deductions constitute a sick-fund for the support of the men during\r\n  ordinary sickness. The following is a translation of the articles of\r\n  the Prussian code in respect to the responsibility now imposed on the\r\n  owners for accidents to the workpeople in Prussia as in Austria:—\r\n\r\n  Art. 214. “The proprietors of the mines are bound to take care of the\r\n  miners who are wounded or fall into bad health in their service.\r\n\r\n  Art. 215. “When the provincial laws do not contain any express\r\n  provisions thereon, the person who works the mine shall pay to the\r\n  sick or wounded workman four weeks’ wages if the produce of the mine\r\n  does not cover the expense of working, or if it be only just equal to\r\n  it, or if it be required to defray the antecedent expenses of the\r\n  mine; and when the mine produces a sufficient dividend, the workman\r\n  shall be paid eight weeks’ wages in case the illness lasts that length\r\n  of time.\r\n\r\n  Art. 216. “If the illness lasts a greater length of time, the miner\r\n  shall be supported out of the sick-fund.\r\n\r\n  Art. 217. “The expenses of medical treatment, and of burial of a miner\r\n  wounded or killed by accident, shall be defrayed from the same fund.\r\n\r\n  Art. 218. “The widow of a miner has also the right to claim the\r\n  gratuitous wages fixed by Article 215.\r\n\r\n  Art. 219. “The gratuitous wages granted to the miner in case of wounds\r\n  or death are not allowed if the miner has killed or wounded himself\r\n  with premeditation, or by any gross neglect, working otherwise than in\r\n  the mine.\r\n\r\n  Art. 220. “If the wound or death has been occasioned by malice or the\r\n  gross neglect of a third person, the latter shall indemnify the\r\n  sick-fund and the proprietors of the mine.”—E. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n26. _Extract from the Report of John L. Kennedy, Esq., Barrister at Law,\r\n to the Commissioners for Inquiring into the Labour of Young Persons in\r\n                       Mines and Manufactories._\r\n\r\nIn all the instances which I have met with of accidents occurring in\r\ncoal-mines, as I have repeatedly stated, negligence forms an almost\r\ninvariable element—negligence which is fairly assignable to one or other\r\nof the parties concerned in this branch of industry: either negligence\r\non the part of the colliers, whether adults or children, in omitting\r\nthose means of safety which are within their own control, or negligence\r\non the part of the superintendent, or ultimately of the owners of the\r\nmines, in not providing the _means_, or duly regulating those means of\r\nsafety, which are not within the discretion of any child or the control\r\nof the individual workman.\r\n\r\nThe children who are below the age of discretion are of course not to be\r\ndeemed responsible for that which they have not to exercise; and\r\nunfortunately in the present state of education of the adult colliers, a\r\nlarge proportion of them are in the same category as children in respect\r\nto the want of discretion; and hence arises the first difficulty of any\r\ndirect legislative interference for their protection.\r\n\r\nWhatever detailed provisions might be laid down in any statute, or\r\ndirected by any public officer acting under the authority of any\r\nstatute, I can see no reason to believe that they would be adopted below\r\nground by such a population.\r\n\r\nFor example; the safety-lamp is provided by most, and directed by all\r\nproprietors and underlookers to be used by the colliers; but, as we have\r\nseen, they habitually set aside the protection thus provided for them,\r\nthough they do so under a penalty of maiming or death—and what more\r\nsevere penalty could any statute impose or enforce with greater\r\ncertainty? Education appears to me to be the slow and remote but\r\ncomplete preventive of those calamities arising from indiscretion. The\r\nefficiency of this remedy, the fact that ignorance and brutality are not\r\nessential to mining occupations, will, I apprehend, be shown by the\r\ncomparative superiority of a better educated class of miners, namely,\r\nthe Cornish miners and the lead miners of Lead Hills, Lanarkshire, who\r\noften, with less wages than the colliers of this district, attain a\r\nsuperior condition and are comparatively free from the like instances of\r\nindiscretion.\r\n\r\nIt will, however, be seen that there is a large class of accidents which\r\ncomes within the control of responsible agents, and which would scarcely\r\nbe within the control of the colliers, even if they had the discretion.\r\nFor example, the sufficiency of the winding-ropes, guiders and\r\nside-rods, chairs, sliders, casing of the pit sides with brick and\r\nmortar, covers over the tubs to prevent coal falling on those ascending\r\nand descending in them, and the various other means of security in\r\nsuperior pit gearing, which, having been adopted in some mines with\r\nsuccess, are demonstrably practicable, and no doubt ought to be used in\r\nall other similar cases.\r\n\r\nBut these practical measures appear to me from their number to be\r\nincapable of specification in any statute that could be discussed or\r\ntolerated in Parliament, if it should take upon itself the direction of\r\nmining operations, and they are apparently too numerous and important,\r\nto be intrusted to the discretion of any public officer. Positive\r\nregulations by statute or under legislative sanction would, I apprehend,\r\nimpede changes in machinery and in operations which are commonly\r\nbeneficial to the whole class of the workpeople. In whatsoever mode such\r\npreventive regulations were prescribed, the enforcement of them would, I\r\napprehend, imply an inspection by a public officer; from the nature of\r\nthe places I should doubt the efficiency of such inspection. I doubt\r\nwhether inspectors could be found who would faithfully descend shafts\r\ntwo or three times the depth of the height of St. Paul’s, and amidst wet\r\nand damp and noxious gases crawl or allow themselves to be waggoned\r\nthrough miles of dark drains and subterranean caverns, with the chance\r\nof the roof falling on them or being burnt by explosion, _to see that\r\nall was right_, and not act on the easy assumption that it was so.\r\n\r\nI believe, in the course of my own performance of the disagreeable duty\r\nassigned to me, I became tolerably familiar with such places; but I\r\ncould not but perceive that I might easily have been deceived, and was\r\nalways at the mercy of the colliers themselves for the completeness of\r\nmy information.\r\n\r\nNo familiarity diminishes the disagreeable duty of proceeding through\r\nlow, hot, and damp galleries, bent with the chest on the knees, under\r\nthe oppression of clothes damp with moisture or perspiration, which the\r\ninspector must endure.\r\n\r\nProprietors themselves, whose direct interest it is to be aware of what\r\nis going forward under ground, are obliged to depend for inspection on\r\ntheir underlookers or foremen, who have been colliers.\r\n\r\nIn a large proportion of accidents, especially those where the witnesses\r\nare themselves destroyed, it would, I conceive, be extremely difficult,\r\nif not impossible, to prove against underlookers or proprietors the\r\nneglect of proper precaution. For example, in explosions of fire-damp\r\nthe air-doors are frequently blown to pieces, the waggons dashed to\r\natoms, the roof brought in by collapse from the exhaustion of the air in\r\nthe mine, and, in short, the position of everything so completely\r\nderanged that it would be impossible to arrive at any correct conclusion\r\nas to the state of things previous to the accident.\r\n\r\nA boy is thrown out of a tub in ascending the pit-shaft by the chairs\r\ncoming in contact half way, the chairs may or may not be broken, the\r\nbody is found dashed to pieces at the bottom; if it so happen that there\r\nare no marks either on the chairs or basket to show that they have been\r\nin contact, no one would be so bold as to swear that it was so. Numerous\r\ncases of this nature might be cited.\r\n\r\nIt may be a question whether extensive remedies are not practicable by\r\nthe application of the principle of concentrating responsibility on\r\nthose who have the best means of prevention, by such self-acting\r\narrangements as shall give them a direct interest in prevention.\r\nCoal-owners and the underlookers of collieries assume that all the\r\naccidents which are not caused by the negligence of the workmen\r\nthemselves are absolutely unavoidable, and in the present state of their\r\ninterest and knowledge I believe them to be sincere in their assumption.\r\nAs evidence of its truth, and in justification, they may adduce the\r\nfrequent return of verdicts of simply “accidental death” upon inquests\r\nbefore the coroners. Conceding most fully that a large extent of\r\naccident is an unavoidable and essential concomitant of this branch of\r\nindustry, the question then arises, Why should not this branch of\r\nindustry bear the whole of its necessary and unavoidable consequences?\r\n\r\nThe more this question is examined, the more I apprehend will it be\r\nfound desirable that the full expenses of such accidents should be borne\r\nby that branch of industry in which they are created; in which case they\r\nwill be borne either by those who, as producers, have the chief profits,\r\nor they will fall, as I apprehend they ought to fall, on the consumers.\r\n\r\nThe satisfaction of the pecuniary losses attendant on _personal\r\ninjuries_ from accidents, heavy and long continued as those losses are,\r\nwill be found to be a consideration of minor importance to the\r\n_prevention_ of the accidents; and, above all, the prevention of the\r\ndegraded mental condition of the reckless population amidst which such\r\naccidents occur. By imposing the pecuniary consequences, not as\r\npenalties for omissions, which at present are really not wilful, but as\r\na trade charge or _insurance_ payable by the branch of industry liable\r\nto the accidents, an interest will be created in their prevention on the\r\npart of those who alone have the means of efficiently preventing them.\r\nInstead of a penalty in the expense to which they might be put, they\r\nwould thus have a perpetually acting bounty in the saving of every new\r\nimprovement, and would be made the most efficient inspectors—having in\r\nevery foreman and collier a superintendent in himself, gratis to the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nIt is a maxim of this district that manufacturers “only improve or adopt\r\nimprovements upon threadbare profits.” Under the bounty created by the\r\njust and necessary charge upon the mines of the insurance against\r\naccidents and calamities, it can scarcely be doubted that the\r\ncoal-owners would find out and adopt improvements in working of which\r\nthey are themselves at present unaware. They would, moreover, have an\r\ninterest in the removal by education of that dense ignorance,\r\nconstituting that state of mind out of which the acts of “indiscretion”\r\nor heedlessness, and the other daily acts which disturb the community,\r\nemanate. Even with the present adult colliers, they would have an\r\ninterest in exercising such a preventive control as would be exemplified\r\nby a case in another branch of industry which I have cited in the\r\nsection on Accidents in my Report on the Calico Print-Grounds—I allude\r\nto the case of the men who were employed in kyanizing logs of wood on\r\nthe Bolton and Preston Railway. It would, of course, follow from the\r\nadoption of the principle of charging the costs of accidents as an\r\ninsurance or trade charge on the employment, or on those who had the\r\nbest means of preventing them—viz. the coal-proprietors—that they should\r\nbe enabled to distribute the principle of self-insurance and\r\nresponsibility on their underlookers and workmen.\r\n\r\nI avail myself of an illustration of the operation of the principle of\r\npreventive legislation which appears to me to be applicable to cases of\r\nthe nature of those which are the subjects of this Report.\r\n\r\nFormerly convicts were transported in private vessels engaged for the\r\npurpose at a charge of a certain amount per head on the number\r\n_embarked_. The ships belonged to respectable merchants and owners; and\r\non that responsibility which is supposed to attach to fair character and\r\nrespectability the convicts were committed to their charge.\r\n\r\nThe interest which engrossed the mind of the shipowner, it may be\r\npresumed, was that of making the most of his vessels, and sending out a\r\nfull cargo. No wilful oversight, still less any oppression, was perhaps\r\nimputable to the owners, the captains, or any one else: but still the\r\nfair profits of a good cargo could scarcely be expected to be sacrificed\r\nfor the avoidance of any temporary inconvenience of convicts during a\r\nvoyage; but somehow or other it happened that fever broke out, and that\r\nthe mortality during the first voyages was dreadful—sometimes half the\r\npassengers were lost. I presume that the convicts were accompanied by\r\nofficers of the Government; but the importance of ventilation was little\r\nknown at that time, and even the King’s ships were ravaged by scurvy,\r\ndysentery, and fever. The appointment of special inspectors for this\r\npurpose solely would possibly have mitigated the evil to some extent,\r\nperhaps to an extent to warrant the expense; but I believe it would have\r\nprotracted amendment, and left untouched a large mass of evil.\r\n\r\nAt length, however, the form of contract was altered: instead of the\r\nshipowners being paid per head on the number _embarked_, they were only\r\npaid per head _on the number landed alive_; so that the shipowners lost\r\nby every person who died on the passage. This form of contract changed\r\nthe whole face of things.\r\n\r\nAttention, or the efficient stimulus of interest, was directed to the\r\ncause of the mortality: ventilation and other appliances were sedulously\r\nattended to; the merchant, at his own proper cost, provided a medical\r\nofficer to take charge of the convicts, and the remuneration of that\r\nofficer was proportioned to the number landed _alive_. The result was\r\nthat the frightful mortality disappeared, and the voyages have generally\r\nbeen effected with a higher degree of health amongst the passengers, or\r\nwith less mortality, than would perhaps have occurred amongst the same\r\nnumber of the same class of persons living at large on shore.[64] The\r\nEast India Company have also, I am informed, adopted the same principle\r\nin the payment of the medical officers who have charge of the transport\r\nof their troops. The same principle has been directed to be applied by\r\nthe Poor Law Commissioners in the contracts for the shipment of\r\npauper-emigrants for Canada; and I am informed that complaints and the\r\ncause of them have proportionably disappeared.\r\n\r\nI am informed by a friend who has taken a great interest in the subject\r\nof the transport of emigrants, that a year or two ago the principle was\r\noverlooked in the transport of emigrants by the Government agent. Some\r\nvessels were chartered and officered by Government officers of the\r\nhighest character; but fever broke out in those ships, and there was\r\nsevere suffering; whilst the voyages of ordinary emigrant-ships,\r\ncommanded by common skippers—people of no rank or consideration, but\r\nplaced under a contract which made their interest coincident with\r\nhumanity—made their voyages as any person of practical experience and\r\nobservance of the operation of different interests might have expected.\r\n\r\nI believe that the practical application of the same principle of\r\nlegislation, viz. the concentration of responsibility on those who may\r\nbest find out and apply the means of prevention, would, in this\r\nimportant branch of industry, in which such numbers of young persons,\r\nand persons young in understanding and discretion, are employed, would\r\nbe the most efficient preventive, and would, at the same time, give the\r\nowners and managers of collieries, at the outset, the least trouble, and\r\nultimately a high degree of comfort.\r\n\r\nI may here repeat, that it is observable in the district assigned to me,\r\nthat the accidents from the breakage of rope are of rare occurrence in\r\nthe deepest mines. The cost of a rope for the deeper mines is\r\nproportionably greater than for those of less depth. Not only,\r\ntherefore, is the breakage of a rope a serious loss in itself, but the\r\ncause of still more serious loss from the interruption of the very\r\nextensive operations of the large mines to which they belong. It is a\r\nmatter of fact, that greater care is bestowed on these expensive ropes\r\nand gearing, because it is the interest of those who are not always\r\nthinking about preventing _remote_ accidents, but who are naturally and\r\nproperly always thinking about _immediate_ profits, to take care of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility implied by the proposed application of the principle\r\nfor prevention, is a responsibility for exercise of care in their own\r\nbusiness operations, which care can be exercised by them and no others,\r\nwithout interrupting and interfering with them in their business\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  27.—_Tables of Sickness in Prisons._\r\n\r\n  Table showing the Sickness experienced by 2,876 Prisoners committed to\r\n the

to Owners or Occupiers for the\r\ndistribution of the Expense of permanent Alterations, and the avoidance\r\n   of Overcharges on persons enjoying only portions of the benefit._\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners of Sewers appointed to superintend the execution of\r\nthe    Act of Victoria, passed for the protection of the public health,\r\nwhich requires that every inhabited tenement shall be provided with\r\nproper means of drainage, and cleansing, and the removal of refuse, have\r\ncaused a survey to be made of the houses and tenements in—[court or\r\nstreet, as the case may be]. On this survey it appears that your house,\r\nwith others in the same place, are without the requisites required by\r\nlaw; that they are without proper sewers, without drainage from the\r\nhouse, and without water or proper means for the constant removal of\r\nnight-soil, or conveniences for cleansing.\r\n\r\nBy the    section of the Act the several requisites hereunder described\r\nare directed to be provided and completed within    months after this\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners have directed tenders for contracts upon\r\nspecifications to be taken for the execution of the required works,\r\nunder a civil engineer, in the most beneficial manner and at the lowest\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nThey are also prepared to take loans on the security of the rates for\r\ndefraying the expenses of the execution of the works contracted for.\r\n\r\nIt will be at your option either to repay at once the cost of the\r\nrequisite works by which the property will be benefited, or to repay it\r\nby annual instalments in 30 year, paying 5 per cent. interest on the\r\nprincipal sum expended, or on that part of it that may, from time to\r\ntime, remain unpaid.\r\n\r\nTo save the trouble and expense of a double collection, annual\r\ninstalments and the interest on the principal sums expended will be\r\ncollected from the tenant with    rates. Where the landlord is under any\r\nagreement or obligation to cleanse the cesspools, the tenant will be\r\nentitled to deduct from the rent the charge for the drainage and\r\napparatus for cleansing. Where the tenant pays rent weekly, or at\r\nshorter periods than quarterly, and does not pay    rates, the charge\r\nfor the works in question is required by the statute to be paid by the\r\nowner of the tenement, who will levy the amount with the rent, or make\r\nhis own terms with the tenant for the improvement in question.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the required improvements or principal sum, which will be\r\ncharged at the contract prices, together with the annual instalments and\r\ninterest thereon, and the weekly charge or improved rent that may be due\r\nor charged on the weekly tenant, will be as follows:—\r\n\r\n ┌───────────────────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐\r\n │                           │             │   Annual    │             │\r\n │                           │             │  Interest,  │             │\r\n │                           │             │commuted at 5│Weekly Charge│\r\n │                           │   Annual    │per cent. on │   to the    │\r\n │First Outlay per Tenement. │ Instalment  │   Outlay,   │ Tenant, or  │\r\n │                           │for Repayment│ charged as  │  Increased  │\r\n │                           │in 30 years. │   Rent on   │    Rent.    │\r\n │                           │             │ Tenant, and │             │\r\n │                           │             │ Annual Rent │             │\r\n │                           │             │  of Water.  │             │\r\n ├───────────────────────────┼──────┬──────┼──────┬──────┼──────┬──────┤\r\n │              £.  _s._ _d._│ _s._ │ _d._ │ _s._ │ _d._ │ _s._ │ _d._ │\r\n │Water-closet               │      │      │      │      │      │      │\r\n │  Water-tank   10    8    6│     6│    11│     6│     8│     0│     3│\r\n │  Drain                    │      │      │      │      │      │      │\r\n │Main Sewer      5   12    0│     3│     9│     3│     6│     0│    1½│\r\n │Water                      │      │      │     5│     0│     0│     1│\r\n ├───────────────────────────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┤\r\n │           Total           │    10│     8│    15│     2│     0│    5½│\r\n └───────────────────────────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┘\r\n\r\nIf the landlord undertake to cleanse the cesspools, then the additional\r\nweekly charge on the occupier for the supplies of water and drainage\r\nwill be 2½_d._ weekly, involving, as the occupier should be informed,\r\nthe conveniences, cleanliness, and security to health, and saving of\r\nmedical expenses.\r\n\r\nPersons having only interests in property for years or for determinate\r\nperiods may, by means of the above table, distribute amongst the persons\r\nsuccessively interested in the property the portions of the charge to\r\nwhich they are liable.\r\n\r\nThe surveyor and officers of sewers are charged with the duty of from\r\ntime to time inspecting and seeing to the sufficiency of the means of\r\ndrainage and cleansing. By the terms of the contract the contractor is\r\nbound to make good the drains for    years, but the tenant will be\r\nliable to make good any wanton damage.\r\n\r\nThe Act gives to the owner of the beneficial interest in the premises\r\nthe option of executing the prescribed works himself, on giving notice\r\non or before the    of such his intention, and entering into his surety\r\nto execute them within the time prescribed and according to the contract\r\nspecifications, to the satisfaction of the officer charged with the\r\nsuperintendence of the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n30.—_Extracts from Evidence on the Moral and Physical Evils which may be\r\n           created by the mode of Hiring and Paying Workmen._\r\n\r\n    (Extract from Evidence given before a Committee of the House of\r\n                               Commons.)\r\n\r\n                           CHARLES SAUNDERS.\r\n\r\nWhat is your occupation?—Coal-whipper.\r\n\r\nHave the goodness to state to the Committee the manner in which coal\r\nwhippers are engaged and paid?—I have been in the habit of obtaining a\r\nliving by coal whipping for the last 10 years, and when I want\r\nemployment, (me and the likes of me of course,) I have to go to the\r\npublican to get a job, to ask him for a job; and he tells me to go and\r\nsit down, and he will give me an answer by and by. I go and sit down,\r\nand if I have 2_d._ in my pocket, of course I am obliged to spend it,\r\nwith a view of getting a job; and, probably, when two or three hours\r\nhave elapsed, by that time there is about 50 or 60 people come on the\r\nsame errand to the same person for a job. He keeps us three or four\r\nhours there; and then he comes out, and he looks round among us, and he\r\nknows those well that can drink the most, and those are the people that\r\nobtain employment first. Those that cannot drink a great deal, and think\r\nmore of their family than others do, cannot obtain any employment; those\r\nthat drink the most get the most employment. When the men are made up\r\nfor the ship, we go to work the next day morning, but we have to take\r\nwhat the publican calls the allowance, such as a quartern of rum, or\r\nthree half-quarterns, or a pot of beer, or what not; then they have to\r\ntake a pot of beer off in a bottle on board,—what he calls beer, but not\r\nfit for a man to drink, generally speaking, what I call poison: I have\r\nactually teemed it overboard myself, before I could drink it; I could\r\nnot drink it, although I have been sweating and as thirsty as a man\r\ncould be, and have put it overboard, and gone and dipped my bottle in a\r\nbucket of water.\r\n\r\nIn the after part of the day, when your work was over, where did you go\r\nthen?—Then, when we have done our day’s work, we came on shore, and we\r\nhad to go into the house again; and perhaps we might want a shilling or\r\ntwo to get our families a little support; the landlord would tell us to\r\ngo and sit down in the tap-room, and he would give us some by and by,\r\nand he would keep us there until nine or ten at night; first, we would\r\ngo for a pint or a pot, or what not, to see whether he was getting\r\nready, for we dare not go empty-handed, without a pot or pint, or to\r\ncall for something by way of excuse; after keeping us there until nine\r\nor ten at night, then he would give us 2_s._ 6_d._ or 3_s._\r\n\r\nWere you obliged to spend money in drink?—Yes.\r\n\r\nCould you not avoid it by any means?—No.\r\n\r\nWhat would have happened if you had refused to spend money in\r\ndrink?—Then we could have no employment; and moreover than that, if you\r\nhad had what you thought was requisite, if he did not think it was\r\nsufficient, he would add more than what you had actually contracted for;\r\nand if you refused to pay this, and you said, “I have not had but so\r\nmuch, I won’t pay it.” “Oh, won’t you; if you do not, here is your\r\nmoney, what you say it is; go out, and never come in here again.”\r\n\r\nHave you known anybody refused employment because they would not\r\ncontribute to the publican’s demand for drink?—Yes, I could find 50.\r\n\r\nWho have lost their employment because they would not drink so much as\r\nthe publican wished?—Yes, I could.\r\n\r\nCould you not engage yourself to the captain of the ship without going\r\nto the publican?—No, for the publicans are some of them shipowners, and\r\nthey are all intermixed through the trade by one thing and another, so\r\nthat the captain or owner of the ship gives the favour to the publican\r\nto employ the whippers.\r\n\r\n\r\n   MR. CLAYDON, _Master of the Limehouse Workhouse, belonging to the\r\n                            Stepney Union_.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the labouring classes, have you observed whether, with\r\nrespect to any of them, these ill-regulated inclinations are subjected\r\nto unnecessary temptations?—The practice of paying men at public houses,\r\nand making the obtaining employment dependent in a certain measure upon\r\ndrinking, which is the case with the coal-whippers.\r\n\r\nHave you ever had occasion as respects the coal-whippers to investigate\r\nthose cases?—We did at one period, having an opportunity, investigate\r\nupwards of 40 cases of coal-whippers.\r\n\r\nThose were 40 applicants for relief?—The greater part of them were; 22\r\nof them were in the immediate receipt of relief at the time the others\r\nwere applicants.\r\n\r\nWhat was the result in those cases?—We took their earnings over a\r\nconsiderable period, and we found that they had earned, taking the\r\naverage, 18_s._ 10_d._ per week. The utmost we could make out that their\r\nfamilies had received of that, in any shape, was 12_s._ 10_d._ per week.\r\nWhatever might have been their family, one-third of it had gone in drink\r\nand those charges which were brought against them.\r\n\r\nHad any of those men earned more than that?—There were instances in\r\nwhich they had earned 20_s._ a-day.\r\n\r\nAnd all came upon the pauper list just the same?—Yes, just as destitute\r\nas the rest, saving never seems to enter into their calculation at all.\r\n\r\nThen with respect to this particular class, notwithstanding their\r\nearning wages twice as much as agricultural labourers earn probably, and\r\nwhich agricultural labourers save money, and are depositors in\r\nsavings-banks, these men made no deposits, and no reserve, but the whole\r\nof them fall upon the rates? In one shape or other they receive the\r\npublic charity, is that so?—Yes, in fact they have not the means\r\npossessed by other labourers, of pawning anything. I question whether\r\nyou could find as much furniture in any one of their houses, as you\r\ncould pawn for 2_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nNot even in those cases where they are earning a guinea a-day?—No, they\r\nare all alike destitute, and their families look as dirty and as filthy,\r\nand are as ill-governed, and their houses are as destitute of furniture\r\nas those who earn the smaller sums, there is no difference; and in case\r\nof sickness they come at once upon the parish, unless they sometimes\r\nassist each other a little; but, however, they have no certain means at\r\nall but the parish. Their sicknesses are generally short. In most cases\r\nthey are so ill prepared to bear sickness, that they are cut off very\r\nrapidly, and die comparatively young. I do not speak this from actual\r\nexperience however.\r\n\r\nHave you seen the cases of the widows, and the children coming in upon\r\nthe parish?—Yes, we have 28 cases now. Our present numbers are 425\r\nchildren, that is from the whole of the Union; there is only a small\r\nportion of the Union in the coal-whippers’ district, but we have 28\r\nchildren directly belonging to them, some of them legitimate, and others\r\nillegitimate; all of that origin that we know decidedly that they are\r\nthe produce of those coal-whippers.\r\n\r\nAre the same observations as to the causes of the pauperism of the\r\nadults to be taken as to the causes of the pauperism of the\r\nchildren?—Yes. The observation is universal. The children cannot have\r\nproduced it themselves, but they have the same habits and the same\r\nproneness to indulge the appetites, in fact I think there is a\r\nremarkable deficiency in the consideration of most parents, in that\r\nmatter, even of respectable parents; they let their children go to the\r\nconfectioners and buy drams, for they are drams in another form,\r\npeppermint and cloves, and so on, made up into articles of\r\nconfectionary, and nothing is so likely to produce a depraved appetite,\r\nthe transition is so natural from that to ardent spirit.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the residences of those classes, the coal-whippers\r\nespecially, have you observed whether you have bad any cases of sickness\r\narising from their state of filthiness, or traceable to it?—I do not\r\nknow whether we can attribute it to that, but nothing can be more\r\nlikely, although it is impossible to say, for the coal-whipper is very\r\nlittle at home, still nothing can be conceived more destitute, or more\r\ndisgusting than their abodes.\r\n\r\nWhat are the sorts of children you receive in the house from them with\r\nrespect to training or education, that is, of those classes of\r\ncoal-whippers?—They are completely uneducated; the generality of them\r\nare very untractable.\r\n\r\nAllowed to run about wild?—Completely.\r\n\r\nNo care taken of them?—Not the ordinary care of cleanliness. I had three\r\nin last night, and notwithstanding all our anxiety after economy we were\r\nobliged to burn every rag of their clothes. To cleanse them was out of\r\nthe question entirely; that is the case with half that come in to the\r\nworkhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Sargeant_, the relieving officer of the same district.\r\n\r\nIs it not your duty to visit the houses, and to inquire into the cases\r\nof applicants for relief? Yes, it is.\r\n\r\nIn doing so, you must trace the causes of the application for\r\nrelief?—Yes.\r\n\r\nWhat is the chief cause you find precede the application for\r\nrelief?—Excessive drink.\r\n\r\nIn respect to those trammels which it is described that the\r\ncoal-whippers are in, what is the consequence as to their households?\r\nhow do you find, when you visit those cases, that their houses are\r\nprovided?—I would rather sleep in my coal-hole than in any of their\r\nhovels. I went into six houses yesterday, each house contains four\r\nrooms, and in some of those houses there were 30 souls. In the least\r\nhouse there were 17.\r\n\r\nHow many sleep in the same room?—In one room there were four widows and\r\ntwo children, in the most wretched place imaginable.\r\n\r\nAre quarrels between man and wife frequent?—Yes; through drink.\r\n\r\nAre separations frequent? Yes; separations through drink on the part of\r\nthe wife.\r\n\r\nHow many cases have you of wives separated from their husbands in the\r\nsame way? I have had 15.\r\n\r\nThe wives, then, have imbibed the habits of the husbands? Yes.\r\n\r\nIs there no cleanliness on a Sunday? Oh dear, no!\r\n\r\nNo attendance to church? No.\r\n\r\nAs to the children, what is their condition? The children of most abject\r\nwretchedness. Those poor children are sent out to scour the streets, to\r\npick up and do anything else they can; and not particular to thieving.\r\n\r\nWhat the condition of the girls?—The girls, when infants of seven years\r\nof age, are turned out into the streets with fruit and all sorts of\r\nthings; when they arrive at the age of 14, go to stay stitching; then\r\nthey sit in doors at home with their mother, and so on, until the age of\r\n15 or 16, when they generally become prostitutes. I see it, because I am\r\nalways amongst them. I have tried to get them to send those girls out to\r\nservice, when they say, “Mr. Sargeant, what am I to do? my husband earns\r\nbut little, I am obliged to depend upon what my daughter can do and\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Rooke_, the relieving officer of St. George’s in the East.\r\n\r\nI know the poor population of our parish well. I know that a large\r\nproportion of the juvenile delinquents in our streets are coal-whippers’\r\nchildren; I have known some of them to be transported. I know also that\r\nthe girls, who are coal-whippers’ children, turn out prostitutes; it is\r\nseldom that any of them turn out to be good servants. Delirium tremens\r\nis a frequent complaint amongst the coal-whippers, and it sometimes\r\nextends to madness. There is one girl, for example, Margaret Harley,\r\naged 25, the daughter of a coal-whipper, who, for the last 10 years, has\r\nalways been either in a prison, in our workhouse, or the lunatic asylum;\r\nI do not believe that during that time she has been 10 months out of\r\neither of those places. I know a large proportion of the prostitutes in\r\nour district who, as the children of these improvident classes, have\r\neither been inmates of the house or otherwise chargeable to the public.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  The Commissioners have no money to remunerate physicians; and those\r\n  named should be distinctly informed that the service will be purely\r\n  honorary.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  Vide Appendix C.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  See the evidence on this subject taken before the Committee of the\r\n  House of Commons, on the sewerage of the metropolis; see also the\r\n  evidence of _Mr. Oldfield_, an extensive builder, _post_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Vide the evidence of Mr. Dark and Mr. Treble, Appendix.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Smith, of Deanston, is of opinion that it would be practicable to\r\n  distribute such refuse by irrigation without exposure of the surface\r\n  of the fluid in which it is held in suspension.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  Professor Liebig in his work on the “Chemistry of Agriculture,” refers\r\n  to various authorities on the practical value of such refuse, who\r\n  state that “human urine is, if possible, more husbanded by the Chinese\r\n  than night-soil for manure; every farm or patch of land for\r\n  cultivation has a tank, where all substances convertible into manure\r\n  are carefully deposited, the whole made liquid by adding urine in the\r\n  proportion required, and invariably applied in that state.” This is\r\n  exactly the process followed in the Netherlands.—See “Outlines of\r\n  Flemish Husbandry,” p. 22. “The business of collecting urine and\r\n  night-soil employs an immense number of persons, who deposit tubs in\r\n  every house in the cities for the reception of the urine of the\r\n  inmates, which vessels are removed daily with as much care as our\r\n  farmers remove their honey from the hives. When we consider the\r\n  immense value of night-soil as a manure, it is quite astounding that\r\n  so little attention is paid to preserve it. The quantity is immense\r\n  which is carried down by the drains in London to the river Thames,\r\n  serving no other purpose than to pollute its waters. A substance which\r\n  by its putrefaction generates miasmata may, by artificial means, be\r\n  rendered totally inoffensive, inodorous, and transportable, and yet\r\n  prejudice prevents these means being resorted to. If,” says the\r\n  professor, “we admit that the liquid and solid excrements of man\r\n  amount on an average to 1½ lb. daily (5/4 lb. of urine and ¼ lb.\r\n  fæces), and that both together contain 3 per cent. of nitrogen; then\r\n  in one year they will amount to 547 lbs., which contain 16·41 lbs. of\r\n  nitrogen, a quantity sufficient to yield the nitrogen of 800 lbs. of\r\n  wheat, rye, oats, or of 900 lbs. of barley.”—(Boussingault) “This is\r\n  much more than is necessary to add to an acre of land in order to\r\n  obtain, with the assistance of the nitrogen absorbed from the\r\n  atmosphere, the richest possible crop every year. Every town and farm\r\n  might thus supply itself with the manure which, besides containing the\r\n  most nitrogen, contains also the most phosphates, and if rotation of\r\n  the crops were adopted, they would be most abundant.”—Edited by Dr.\r\n  LYON PLAYFAIR.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  See _post_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  Treatise on Road Formation and Cleansing.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  See in the Appendix the form of calculation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  In Paris the greater proportion of the private houses are even now\r\n  supplied with water only by water-carriers, and the means of the\r\n  immediate conveyance of refuse, by a system of water-closets\r\n  communicating through drains to sewers to receptacles for use, could\r\n  not have been presented to the consideration of the men of science to\r\n  whom the subject was referred. It appears that in the first class of\r\n  houses in that city the cesspools were formerly only emptied once in\r\n  four or five years, and that it is now considered a great improvement\r\n  that they are emptied twice or thrice a-year. But the offensiveness\r\n  and the frequent injurious effects from emptying and removing the\r\n  contents, has led to the proposal of a plan of closed receptacles or\r\n  removable tanks, in which the soil maybe carted away to the place of\r\n  deposit for use as manure. The retention, however, of accumulations,\r\n  which can only be constantly removed by means of water, and the want\r\n  of proper supplies of water laid on in the houses very seriously\r\n  disparages the salubrity and habits of the population of that city, as\r\n  well as of the towns in this country where the same practice prevails.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  Mr. John Martin, the artist, has endeavoured to direct public\r\n  attention to the sewerage of the metropolis, and proposed the erection\r\n  of a grand cloaca maxima, and various architectural works along the\r\n  Thames, with the meritorious objects of preventing the pollution of\r\n  the river, and saving the refuse. His plan was to form a canal on each\r\n  bank parallel to the river, so as to intercept the whole of the\r\n  sewerage, and convey it to large reservoirs or places of deposit at a\r\n  distance. His plan for the north bank was a canal, constructed of\r\n  iron, costing 60,000_l._ per mile, extending from Westminster to the\r\n  mouth of the Regent’s Canal, “where the grand receptacle should be\r\n  from which the soil should be conveyed to barges, and transmitted by\r\n  canals to various parts of the country.”—_Committee on Sewers’\r\n  Report_, p. 169. The primary objection to this plan is that it would\r\n  send the refuse still further out of the reach of large districts,\r\n  where it is wanted as manure, to a place where it would only be\r\n  available to the places for which canal conveyance would be\r\n  convenient; that it would leave untouched the great obstacle to the\r\n  use of manure, namely, the cost of removal and application by cartage\r\n  and hand labour. The construction of the canal would also involve the\r\n  disturbance of the whole of the wharf property; as originally\r\n  proposed, it involved their entire reconstruction, and the erection of\r\n  a grand colonnade along the banks of the river. For the removal of the\r\n  refuse, engineers of practical experience agree that the most eligible\r\n  plan was by various small conduits, not larger, where iron pipes might\r\n  be necessary, than the pipes used by the water companies in bringing\r\n  water into the metropolis, at a cost not a fifth, perhaps, of one\r\n  large canal, and without any disturbance of property. For the\r\n  application of the refuse as manure, practical experience at\r\n  Edinburgh, and of irrigation elsewhere, shows that the most effectual\r\n  mode of distribution for use is by water-meadows or drainage and\r\n  irrigation combined; forming an unseen, unostentatious, self-acting\r\n  system of excretory ducts, altogether superseding cartage or hand\r\n  labour, and conveying the refuse in closed streams, acting constantly\r\n  and rapidly until they distribute the refuse into the field of\r\n  production.\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  A litre is one pint and a twentieth.\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  The spread of the knowledge of the fact that animals are subject to\r\n  typhus consumption, and the chief of the train of disorders supposed\r\n  to be peculiarly human, will, it may be expected, more powerfully\r\n  direct attention to the common means of prevention. The following\r\n  extract from a report on the labours of the Board of Health at Paris\r\n  will show the effect of bad ventilation on cattle:—“The _epizootie_\r\n  are in many respects less serious than the epidemics; nevertheless, as\r\n  they often affect the animals which serve for the nutriment of man,\r\n  and that apart from this consideration they may have grave\r\n  consequences for the public health, they have constantly engaged the\r\n  care of the council. In 1834, an _epizootie_ was reported to the\r\n  administration which prevailed among the cows of the communes round\r\n  Paris, and which caused a great mortality. The researches of the\r\n  council established that this _epizootie_ was only a chronic disease,\r\n  a true pulmonary phthisis, to which has been given the name of\r\n  _pommelière_, and by which the greater part of the cows had been\r\n  attacked which fill the stables of the milkmen of Paris and its\r\n  environs. According to the council, the principal cause of the evil\r\n  was to be attributed to the vicious regimen to which this species of\r\n  animal is subjected. It is known that they pass a part of the year in\r\n  stables perfectly closed, in which the space is not proportioned to\r\n  the number of inmates, in which the vitiated air renews itself with\r\n  extreme difficulty, and in which the heat is sometimes suffocating. It\r\n  is known, also, that they pass suddenly from the food of the stable to\r\n  pasture, and that in this change they go from the hot and humid\r\n  atmosphere of the stable to a sudden exposure to the continual\r\n  variations of the external air. This alternation of food and of heat\r\n  and cold operates as a powerful cause of disease. But as the evil does\r\n  not announce itself in a violent manner, as its progress is not very\r\n  rapid, as there is even a period in the disease in which the animal is\r\n  disposed to get flesh, the cow-feeder, who knows to what point to keep\r\n  her, sells her when she is ready to calve. It is in a radius of 30\r\n  leagues from the capital that cows of this kind are purchased by the\r\n  jobbers, who supply the milkmen of Paris. With these last they still\r\n  hold out a certain number of years, if they are properly cared for,\r\n  but in general they are kept in stables which are neither sufficiently\r\n  large nor sufficiently airy, where they are exposed to the same causes\r\n  which gave birth to the malady. The phthisis arrives insensibly at its\r\n  last stage, and carries off every year from Paris and its\r\n  neighbourhood a great number of these cows.” A similar discovery was\r\n  only lately made as to the effect of defective ventilation on the\r\n  cavalry horses in some of the government barracks in England; and it\r\n  is stated, that a saving of several thousand pounds per annum was\r\n  effected by an easy improvement of the ventilation of the barracks\r\n  near the metropolis. An agriculturalist had a large number of sheep\r\n  housed to feed them on mangel wurzel, but a great number of them\r\n  sickened and died, and he declared that it was the food which had\r\n  killed them. A veterinary surgeon, however, who happened to be aware\r\n  of the consequences of defective ventilation, pointed out the\r\n  remedy,—a better ventilation for the sheep, which were overcrowded.\r\n  The defect was remedied; the sheep ate well, and throve upon the\r\n  mangel wurzel.\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  Vide extracts from the official report in the Appendix.\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  The following were the terms of our instructions to the district\r\n  medical commissioners of inquiry:—“A given amount of evil is\r\n  experienced by a class placed under peculiar circumstances; a large\r\n  portion of that evil is shared by other classes not under these\r\n  peculiar circumstances; to attribute the whole of the evil experienced\r\n  by the first class to those peculiar circumstances is obviously\r\n  fallacious. It is conceived that it is only by investigating the\r\n  subject with this precaution constantly in the mind that it is\r\n  possible to arrive at a just conclusion. While you carefully observe\r\n  the effects of labour on the children and the adult workpeople, and\r\n  report every case in which you conceive it to be excessive, and state\r\n  the reasons on which you ground that opinion, you are requested to\r\n  investigate minutely the concurrent causes of ill health. With this\r\n  view you are requested in every case to examine and report the state\r\n  of the drains in and about the factory: the state of the neighbourhood\r\n  of the factory as to dryness or dampness, cleanliness or filthiness:\r\n  the state of the houses and neighbourhood in which the children and\r\n  adult workpeople take their meals and exercise (if they leave the\r\n  factory), and where they sleep: the state of the air within the\r\n  factory, and which the workpeople usually respire, whether it be fresh\r\n  or whether it be not fresh, owing to deficient ventilation,—whether it\r\n  be pure, or whether it be rendered impure by effluvia floating in it,\r\n  and if so, what the effluvia are: what organs of the body are likely\r\n  to be injured, and what, from careful examination, you find to be\r\n  actually injured: the temperature of the air, the highest, the lowest,\r\n  and the average temperature, and the condition of the air as to\r\n  dryness or moisture.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  Rapport de la Commission des Epidémies de l’Académie Royale de\r\n  Médecine pour l’année 1839 et un partie d’ 1840. Par M. Brichetan,\r\n  Secrétaire Rapporteur de la Commission.\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  Vide Dr. Barham’s Report on Truro, Appendix.\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  These Tables are compiled from deaths which took place in Manchester\r\n  during the year 1840; in Leeds during the year 1840; in Liverpool\r\n  during the year 1840; in Bath during the year 1839; in Bethnal Green\r\n  during the year 1839; in the Strand union during the year 1840; in the\r\n  Kendal union during the year ended 30th September, 1841; in the county\r\n  of Wilts during the year 1840; and in Rutland during the three years\r\n  1838, 1839, and 1840.\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  A brief explanation of the construction of tables of mortality may be\r\n  desirable to prevent misapprehensions by those who are unacquainted\r\n  with the nature of such evidence. If amongst 4481 who die each year,\r\n  as at Leeds, it be found that altogether, man, woman, and child, they\r\n  have lived 92,734 years, that number equally divided, without\r\n  distinction of the old and young, gives 21 years as the _average\r\n  period of life_. The variations of such average periods, as shown by\r\n  the tables showing the mean periods of death of a whole population,\r\n  are deemed the best test of its condition and progress. The tables of\r\n  _proportional mortality_ are such as those of Liverpool, where, out of\r\n  223,054 inhabitants, 7435 die; that is to say, one-thirtieth of the\r\n  ascertained population are swept away every year. Such tables only\r\n  serve, however, for remote comparison of the condition of different\r\n  districts, for it will be perceived how large will be the different\r\n  conditions of two communities having exactly the same proportions of\r\n  mortality, but in one of which the deaths occur principally amongst\r\n  the infant population, and the other in which they occur amongst the\r\n  adults. Thus in all the parishes of Leeds, where the average age of\r\n  deaths of all who die is 21 years, since the deaths occur chiefly at\r\n  young ages amongst the labouring classes, the proportions of the\r\n  population who die annually is only 1 in 37. The average age of death,\r\n  or the average extent of life to every individual, may go on\r\n  increasing, and yet the proportions who die remain the same. Hence it\r\n  is that statistical returns of the proportions of death, which are so\r\n  generally used, are fundamentally unstable as means of ascertaining\r\n  the progressive sanitary condition of a population in different\r\n  countries. The _probabilities of life_ at different periods of life on\r\n  which insurance companies act, are determined by tables of a different\r\n  construction. To form a table of the probabilities of life at given\r\n  periods, in 1000 cases say, the date of the birth in each case is\r\n  ascertained, and observations are made of how many remain alive at the\r\n  end of each year at the different periods of life. From the different\r\n  ages at which that 1000 have died, it is held to be probable that\r\n  every other 1000 persons similarly circumstanced will die. The\r\n  observations on which tables of this description have been founded\r\n  have generally been from mixed classes differently circumstanced, and\r\n  no observations on a basis sufficiently large, that I am aware, have\r\n  been made to determine the probabilities of life to any one class of\r\n  workpeople, or to any one class of professional persons. The three\r\n  tables of the proportions of deaths at different ages would be of\r\n  little service to indicate the probability of life at different ages\r\n  unless we could ascertain with exactness the precise numbers of the\r\n  classes _living_ from which the deaths have occurred. More than half\r\n  the children of the working classes die, and only one-fifth of the\r\n  children of the gentry die, before the fifth year of age; and after\r\n  having attained that age, the _probabilities of life_ of the\r\n  labourer’s child might be greater than that of the child of the person\r\n  of the superior classes; but though we have other evidence that the\r\n  reverse is the case, we have not the evidence of well-constructed\r\n  tables of the probability of life at different periods strictly\r\n  applicable to that class. Though the proportions per cent. of those\r\n  who die in the higher and in the lower classes approximate in the\r\n  periods between 20 and 60 years of age, yet we know that the\r\n  probabilities of life in each class at each period are widely\r\n  different. The probable duration of life of a miner who had attained\r\n  40 years of age may not be, and we have reason to believe is not, half\r\n  that of the agricultural labourer, not one-third that of a person of\r\n  the higher ranks who had attained the same period.\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  It is the practice in Geneva for female servants to delay marriage\r\n  until they have saved enough to furnish a house, &c. In illustration\r\n  of this state of things it is stated that in 290 out of 956 marriages,\r\n  the female was at the time of marriage older than the male. With\r\n  further advances in prosperity, it is anticipated that age of marriage\r\n  would again diminish.\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  “Out of 100 deaths in the 16th century, 25·92 were children in their\r\n  first year; in the 17th century, 23·72; in the 18th century, 20·12; in\r\n  1801–13, they were 16·57; and in 1814–33, they were 13·85.” In\r\n  Liverpool, the number of children which in the year 1840 died under\r\n  one year of age was no less than 23 per cent., or what it was in\r\n  Geneva in the 17th century. In the county of Wilts where the\r\n  proportionate mortality is 1 in 58, the deaths of children in the\r\n  first year were 16 per cent. Dr. Griffin, in a report on the sanitary\r\n  condition of the population of Limerick, where the births appear to\r\n  bear such proportions to the marriages as they appear to have borne in\r\n  Geneva in the earliest periods, namely, of five children to a\r\n  marriage, and more in the worst-conditioned districts, makes an\r\n  important observation on the subject: “I find that as the poor nurse\r\n  their own children, there is in general an interval of about two years\r\n  between the birth of one child and that of the next; but if the child\r\n  dies early on the breast, this interval will be much shorter; and if\r\n  this occurs often, there will be a certain number born as it were _for\r\n  the purpose of dying_; and these being soon replaced, the same number\r\n  may still be preserved as if there had been few or no deaths, or only\r\n  the ordinary number.” Of these 55 per cent. died.\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  The registries in England at present supply no means of distinguishing\r\n  the migrant population who die in given places; and in each return a\r\n  small proportion of deaths have been omitted where the station of the\r\n  party has not been described; but taking as approximations the returns\r\n  of the ages of all who die, no district examined appears to present so\r\n  high a probability of life as at Geneva. The average age of all who\r\n  died in the respective periods before stated appear, from the returns\r\n  I have obtained, to be in the county of Rutland 39 years; in the\r\n  Kendal union 36; in the county of Wilts 35 years; in Bath 31; in the\r\n  Kensington union 30; in the Strand union 28; in the Whitechapel union\r\n  27; in Bethnal-green 21; in Leeds 21; in Manchester 20; in Bolton 19;\r\n  in Liverpool 17. By the Northampton Tables the probability of life in\r\n  infancy to all born was 25 years; in Carlisle it was 38.\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  Some constitutions are found which resist vaccine matter. Here and\r\n  there constitutions appear which resist all the noxious influences by\r\n  which they are surrounded, and attain extreme old age. Not\r\n  unfrequently we find the existence of these solitary individuals\r\n  referred to as proofs of the general salubrity of the very\r\n  circumstances under which generations have fallen and been buried\r\n  around them. It is a singular fact, as yet unexplained, that the\r\n  greatest proportion of centenarians are of the labouring classes; and\r\n  that instances of them have from time to time appeared amidst the\r\n  crowded populations in some of the worst neighbourhoods in London,\r\n  where the average duration of life is the lowest. It is remarked by\r\n  Mr. Mallet, that in Geneva extreme old age has not participated in the\r\n  prolongation of life which has taken place in the less advanced ages.\r\n  In the periods of from 60 to 70 years of age the amelioration is\r\n  inconsiderable; after 70 years there is no perceptible improvement;\r\n  after 80 years the aged have indeed a little less probability of life\r\n  at the present time than they had in the 16th century. Centenarians,\r\n  who were not rare in the 16th and 17th centuries, now disappear;\r\n  during the last 27 years Geneva has not produced a single one.\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  _Bibliothèque Universelle, September, 1831._\r\n\r\n  In Alexandria, which is a seat of pestilence, where the Arab\r\n  population leave the ordure before their doors (as we have seen large\r\n  classes of the lower population do in this country), where the dog is\r\n  the only scavenger of the animal refuse (as the pig is in many\r\n  districts in our towns), where those who have died of plague remain\r\n  unburied for days amidst the abodes of the living (as those who have\r\n  died of fever often do in the poorest districts in this\r\n  country),—there, under the more powerful action of a burning sun,\r\n  disease and death are proportionately rife; and, as shown by some\r\n  returns of death in 1841, out of a population of 60,000, the deaths\r\n  were 7,017 (of which 1,165 only were from plague), or more than\r\n  one-tenth of the population. It is known, however, that in the\r\n  well-cleansed and best streets, inhabited by the European and\r\n  fluctuating population, the proportion of mortality is not greater\r\n  than amidst a similar population in the towns of Europe; but it is\r\n  stated that the lower population, notwithstanding that it has been\r\n  decimated by the annual mortality, has, within the last quarter of a\r\n  century, more than doubled.\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\n  An English military officer, who has had much practice as an engineer,\r\n  and who has done much to protect the health of the population of one\r\n  of the South American towns, by drainage, whose opinion I took on the\r\n  efficiency of measures for cleansing inferior districts, recently\r\n  informed me that he should take advantage of a favourable change which\r\n  had occurred in one of the recent revolutions, to return to South\r\n  America, and try what he agreed was the most efficient course of\r\n  proceeding, commencing with the middle classes, by inducing the new\r\n  government to undertake works for bringing water into the houses of\r\n  the inhabitants, and adopt the self-acting system of cleansing the\r\n  poorest districts, and the use of the refuse for distant production,\r\n  on the principles established in this Report.\r\n\r\n  The authorities in Hamburgh have applied to Mr. Lindley, the engineer,\r\n  for a plan for the drainage of that town, and he has recommended for\r\n  adoption the same principles, and the application of the refuse for\r\n  agriculture, at a distance from the houses, instead of discharging it\r\n  into the water which washes the town.\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Bisset Hawkins, the medical Commissioner in the Factory Inquiry,\r\n  stated in his Report, “I believe that most travellers are struck by\r\n  the lowness of stature, the leanness and paleness which present\r\n  themselves so commonly to the eye at Manchester, and above all, among\r\n  the factory classes. I have never been in any town in Great Britain\r\n  nor in Europe in which degeneracy of form and colour from the national\r\n  standard has been so obvious.” P. 6. From a return obtained in 1836\r\n  and presented to the Manchester Statistical Society, of the cattle\r\n  passing the toll-gates and the meat sold in the markets, it appeared\r\n  that the consumption exclusively amongst this population could not be\r\n  less than 105 lbs. each person annually, man, woman, and child, or 450\r\n  lbs. yearly per family of butchers’ meat alone, exclusively of bacon,\r\n  pork, fish, and poultry. The wretched personal appearance of this\r\n  population was only equalled by that of the Irish population of St.\r\n  Giles, where the man earned from 14_s._ or 16_s._ to 1_l._ per week,\r\n  (the wife and child earning something in addition,) but where it is\r\n  their habit to live chiefly on potatoes and use little meat. The\r\n  effect of a pure atmosphere, independently of diet, is shown in this\r\n  population when they go into the country during harvest time. After a\r\n  fortnight or three weeks’ absence, in which they will have had little\r\n  change of living, except, perhaps, taking less spirits, the whole\r\n  family return with the hue of health.\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  I have referred to the experience since the year 1801 in France, where\r\n  the registration of births amongst the migratory population of the\r\n  crowded districts, where the greatest mortality prevails, is likely to\r\n  have been as imperfect as in England, but that experience is, on the\r\n  whole, confirmatory, and proves that in the worst districts the births\r\n  still exceed the mortality.\r\n\r\n ┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐\r\n │             │ Increase of │Proportion of│Proportion of│  Excess of  │\r\n │             │Population in│Births in 35 │Deaths in 35 │ Births over │\r\n │             │ 35 Years in │  Years to   │  Years to   │  Deaths in  │\r\n │             │every 10,000 │  10,000 of  │  10,000 of  │  10,000 of  │\r\n │             │  Persons.   │ Population. │ Population. │ Population. │\r\n ├─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┤\r\n │5 groups of  │             │             │             │             │\r\n │  departments│          311│       10,705│        8,079│        2,626│\r\n │  of _lowest │             │             │             │             │\r\n │  mortality_ │             │             │             │             │\r\n │6 groups of  │             │             │             │             │\r\n │  departments│        2,396│       12,439│       10,044│        2,395│\r\n │  of _mean   │             │             │             │             │\r\n │  mortality_ │             │             │             │             │\r\n │6 groups of  │             │             │             │             │\r\n │  departments│        4,190│       13,024│       12,350│          674│\r\n │  of _highest│             │             │             │             │\r\n │  mortality_ │             │             │             │             │\r\n └─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\n  In recruiting for the French army, the standard is now fixed at 1·566\r\n  metres of height, which is about 5 feet 1½ inches English.\r\n\r\n  Fifty years ago, however, the standard height was 5 feet 4 inches\r\n  English.\r\n\r\n  The English standard is for the Foot Guards 5 feet 6 inches.\r\n\r\n                                                       lbs. avoirdupois.\r\n\r\n The mean weight in Belgium (Brussels and environs)\r\n   of the man is                                                  140·49\r\n\r\n In France (Paris and the neighbourhood)\r\n      the man is                                                  136·89\r\n\r\n The mean weight of the Englishman (taken at\r\n   Cambridge), from 18 to 25                                      150·98\r\n\r\n (In coaches it is usually considered that it\r\n   averages 165 lbs.)\r\n\r\n The mean height of the Belgian male is             5 feet 6‑3/10 inches\r\n\r\n The mean height of the Frenchman                        5 feet 4 inches\r\n\r\n The mean height of the Englishman                      5 feet 9½ inches\r\n\r\n  (M.

At Edinburgh also they were weighed, and, on\r\n  the whole, they gained. See Appendix, statement of the periods of\r\n  confinement and weight of prisoners at the commencement and\r\n  termination of their imprisonment.\r\n\r\nFootnote 34:\r\n\r\n  It is observed by Dr. Wilson, in reference to the mortality in the\r\n  navy, that “the mortality from wounds is inconsiderable compared with\r\n  that occasioned by disease. Much misconception has prevailed on this\r\n  subject in the public mind. Deaths in action, by the general\r\n  excitement attending them, from being published in official despatches\r\n  and perpetuated in gazettes, make more than a due impression; for it\r\n  is found, when accurately reckoned, that they are few in comparison\r\n  with those resulting from ordinary diseases. Sir G. Blane, when\r\n  writing under the common impression, and without the corrections of\r\n  figures, alleges that half the mortality in war periods is\r\n  attributable to wounds received in battle and other external causes;\r\n  but he gives a very different account when he dismisses\r\n  unauthenticated notions to deal with numerical facts. He then states,\r\n  that from 1780 till 1783, though in that period, besides single\r\n  actions, engagements with forts, &c., the great battle of the 12th of\r\n  April was fought, the mortality from disease, compared with that from\r\n  external causes, was as 3 to 1; in 1779, according to his statement,\r\n  the former was to the latter as 8 to 1.” During the last 41 months of\r\n  the peninsular war, whilst 24,930 privates died of disease, only 8899\r\n  died of wounds, or were killed in battle. The deaths during the\r\n  campaign were,—of the privates in battle, 4·2 per cent.; of disease,\r\n  11·9 per cent.: of officers, in battle, 6·6 per cent.; of disease, 3·7\r\n  per cent. per annum. The average deaths in four battles, Talavera,\r\n  Salamanca, Vittoria, and Waterloo, were 3·9 per cent. of officers,\r\n  2·11 of privates. In the peninsular war there were generally 22½ per\r\n  cent. of men absent on account of sickness; and a reduction of the\r\n  proportions of sick to 6 per cent. would have set free 10,000 men from\r\n  the hospitals to be added to the effective force of the\r\n  army.—_Official Returns._ The highest increased charge for insurance\r\n  of military men during the peninsular campaign was 10 guineas per\r\n  cent. The extra premiums taken on the insurance of military lives on\r\n  service in India and China are from 3 to 5 guineas per cent.,\r\n  governed, however, by the unfavourable chances of the climate to which\r\n  the campaign leads, as well as by the increased risks from battle. The\r\n  extra premiums on naval officers in hostile service is usually from 3\r\n  to 5 guineas per cent., governed by the consideration of the climate.\r\n\r\nFootnote 35:\r\n\r\n  _Vide_ Appendix for estimate and detailed specification. From some\r\n  recent experiments made with the egg-shaped sewers or main drains, it\r\n  appears that drains of sufficient size might be made at one-third less\r\n  than the price for sewers in the annexed estimate. In many instances,\r\n  main drains costing one-half the sum would suffice.\r\n\r\nFootnote 36:\r\n\r\n  As an instance of the little account the manufacturing workpeople have\r\n  made of such charges, it is mentioned by Sir Charles Shaw that, on the\r\n  introduction of the new police force into Manchester, he found the\r\n  workpeople in the habit of paying 6_d._ per week each to the old watch\r\n  for calling them up. He put a stop to the practice, as being one which\r\n  interfered with the regular duties of the police, and as being founded\r\n  on a habit which might be corrected. The employers, however,\r\n  complained of the interruption of the practice, and requested that it\r\n  might be renewed. Sir Charles, considering that 6_d._ was too high a\r\n  charge, offered to allow the police to call up the workpeople at 2_d._\r\n  per week each, provided the masters, to save the trouble of the weekly\r\n  collection, deducted the amount from the weekly wages, and paid it\r\n  over to the police fund. The answer to the proposal was, that the\r\n  workpeople would sooner pay 6_d._ of their own accord than have 1_d._\r\n  deducted from their wages by their masters.\r\n\r\nFootnote 37:\r\n\r\n  The experience of France is precisely similar. In a work of great\r\n  authority on the lower classes of that country, it is stated that the\r\n  secret of the existence of so many filthy, infected, and miserable\r\n  habitations, is simply that the persons who pay two sous for their\r\n  lodging at night spend ten sous on brandy by day.\r\n\r\nFootnote 38:\r\n\r\n  A butter merchant informed me that the value of the Irish butter was\r\n  deteriorated to a greater extent than they were aware of, from its\r\n  being frequently made in close smoky hovels instead of in clean and\r\n  well-ventilated dairies, as in England.\r\n\r\nFootnote 39:\r\n\r\n  In an inquiry, from house to house, into the condition of the\r\n  labouring population in the parishes of St. Margaret and St. John\r\n  Westminster, it was found that, out of a total of 5366 houses, 2352\r\n  were occupied for terms under one year, and that no less than 1834 had\r\n  been occupied during periods from one to six months only.\r\n\r\nFootnote 40:\r\n\r\n  It appears that the mortality for five years, ending 1839, was in\r\n  Catrine 1 to 54.20, whilst in Glasgow for the same period it was 1 to\r\n  31.\r\n\r\nFootnote 41:\r\n\r\n  Mohl.

If\r\n  they were maintained on the existing average of territory to the\r\n  population in England, the additional numbers would require an annual\r\n  extension of one fifty-seventh of the present territory of Great\r\n  Britain, possessing the average extent of roads, commons, hills, and\r\n  unproductive land. The extent of new territory required annually would\r\n  form a county larger than Surrey, or Leicester, or Nottingham, or\r\n  Hereford, or Cambridge, and nearly as large as Warwick. To feed the\r\n  annually increased population, supposing it to consume the same\r\n  proportions of meat that is consumed by the population of Manchester\r\n  and its vicinity, (a consumption which appears to me to be below the\r\n  average of the consumption in the metropolis,) the influx of 230,000\r\n  of new population will require for their consumption an annual\r\n  increase of 27,327 head of cattle, 70,319 sheep, 64,715 lambs, and\r\n  7894 calves, to raise which an annual increase of upwards of 81,000\r\n  acres of good pasture land would be required. Taking the consumption\r\n  of wheat or bread to be on the scale of a common dietary, _i. e._, 56\r\n  oz. daily for a family of a man, woman, and three children, then the\r\n  annual addition of supply of wheat required will be about 105,000\r\n  quarters, requiring 28,058 acres of land, yielding 30 bushels of wheat\r\n  to an acre; the total amount of good land requisite for raising the\r\n  chief articles of food will therefore be in all about 109,000 acres of\r\n  good pasture land annually. If the increase of production obtained by\r\n  the use of the refuse of Edinburgh (that is, of 3900 oxen from one\r\n  quarter of the refuse of Edinburgh) be taken as the scale of\r\n  production obtainable by appropriate measures, the refuse of the\r\n  metropolis alone that is now thrown away would serve to feed no less\r\n  than 218,288 oxen annually, which would be equivalent to the produce\r\n  of double that number of acres of good pasture land.\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\n  Vide Report.\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:\r\n\r\n  By the statute of 1 and 2 Wm. IV. c. 57, power was given to\r\n  undertakers to contract for the improvement of land in Ireland, on\r\n  condition that they should receive a profit which was in no case to\r\n  exceed 15_l._ per cent. on the outlay. The undertakers, on the consent\r\n  of two-thirds of the proprietors or of the lessees, were to apply to\r\n  the Lord-lieutenant for a commission. Individual proprietors or\r\n  lessees, not exceeding six in number, upon receiving the assent of\r\n  two-thirds of the proprietors or lessees, might also apply for a\r\n  commission. To the reason above assigned for the failure, these must\r\n  be added—that the machinery of the Act is considered complicated; that\r\n  it nevertheless contained no provisions for ascertaining boundaries,\r\n  without which in Ireland it would be unsafe to raise any annuity upon\r\n  the lands; that the mode of repayment, _i. e._, that if the landlords\r\n  did not within a certain time pay the gross sum assessed, the\r\n  undertakers were entitled to a redeemable annuity upon the lands\r\n  drained; but there was no provision to compel the landowners to pay\r\n  the gross sum, and the annuities might be small and numerous.\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\n  Except in endeavouring to give more emphatic recommendations as to the\r\n  importance of making all the paid officers really responsible, I\r\n  should not vary the representation I had then the honour to make in\r\n  respect to the means of giving efficiency to local administration.\r\n  “With respect to the allusion of Mr. Earle, as to the cry of\r\n  centralization, I conceive that it is a cry to which the few who use\r\n  it can attach no definite ideas, and it has certainly had little\r\n  influence except with the most ignorant. The phrase has been used\r\n  abroad against the destruction of the authority of local\r\n  administrative bodies, and the substitution of an inefficient and\r\n  _irresponsible_ agency by the general government. But even abroad, all\r\n  those who call themselves the friends of popular liberty do not\r\n  declaim against centralization, but against _irresponsibility_. Here\r\n  the phrase is used against a measure by which strong local\r\n  administrative bodies of representatives have been created over the\r\n  greater part of the country, where nothing deserving the name of\r\n  systematised local administration has heretofore existed. The central\r\n  board may be described as an agency necessary for consolidating and\r\n  preserving the local administration, by communicating to each board\r\n  the principles deducible from the experience of the whole; and, in\r\n  cases such as those in which its intervention is now actually sought,\r\n  acting so as to protect the administration being torn by disputes\r\n  between members of the same local board; between a part or a minority\r\n  of the inhabitants and the board, and between one local board and\r\n  another, and in numerous other cases affording an appeal to a distant\r\n  and locally disinterested, yet highly responsible authority, which may\r\n  interpose to prevent the local administrative functions being torn or\r\n  injured by local dissentions. I feel confident that the more the\r\n  subject is examined, the more clearly it will be perceived that the\r\n  great security for the purity and improvement of local administration\r\n  must depend on a central agency.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 48:\r\n\r\n  The parish doctors in England were often paid only 20_l._ per annum\r\n  for attendance in parishes of considerable extent. The payments to\r\n  medical officers who have their private practice are generally\r\n  quadrupled, as compared with the parish doctors. The medical\r\n  arrangements in Glasgow will illustrate the frequent state of the\r\n  existing arrangements in Scotland. The burgh of Glasgow, exclusive of\r\n  the suburbs, is divided into 12 districts, to each of which a medical\r\n  practitioner is appointed, who is paid for his services out of the\r\n  poor’s rates. Dr. Cowan stated of them in his report,—“The duties of\r\n  the district surgeons are laborious and dangerous. Nearly all of them\r\n  take fever, which involves a heavy pecuniary loss. Their salary is\r\n  less than 21_l._ per annum, being less than 1_s._ for the treatment of\r\n  each case.” For an equivalent district in population under the New\r\n  Poor Law in England, namely, in Lambeth, there are four out-door\r\n  medical officers, at salaries of 107_l._ each, and two in-door medical\r\n  officers, at salaries of 128_l._ each. They have in addition their\r\n  private practice and fees for vaccination, and special cases. The\r\n  usual rate of medical allowance to the resident medical officers of\r\n  dispensaries, who are excluded from private practice, has been from\r\n  60_l._ to 70_l._ per annum.\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:\r\n\r\n  After the great fire of London, had the plan of Sir Christopher Wren\r\n  been adopted for the reconstruction of the City, that circumstance\r\n  would have saved the great expenses which have lately been incurred in\r\n  rendering the communications commodious; but no price could now\r\n  achieve the conveniences and facilities which his plan would have\r\n  conferred on the inhabitants during the long interval.\r\n\r\nFootnote 50:\r\n\r\n  The Nungate is situated along the edge of the mill-pool.\r\n\r\nFootnote 51:\r\n\r\n  In dry weather the abrasion of the stones is much less.\r\n\r\nFootnote 52:\r\n\r\n  Scotland Yard, Finsbury Circus, and the north side of St. Paul’s\r\n  Churchyard afford partial illustrations of this arrangement.\r\n\r\nFootnote 53:\r\n\r\n  General Average.\r\n\r\nFootnote 54:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Terry, who is a very extensive farmer in Cookham, and was present\r\n  during this inquiry, explained this, and, in corroboration of Mr.\r\n  Whateley’s evidence on this point, stated that he, as a farmer, could\r\n  not make any profit by growing pigs beyond a certain size. The only\r\n  advantage which he had from keeping them was in using them to collect\r\n  the refuse corn, which would otherwise be trodden under foot at the\r\n  barn-door and rendered unmarketable; the office of the pig was to\r\n  gather up this refuse, and convert it into a marketable commodity,\r\n  pork. To fat the pigs beyond a certain size required more than the\r\n  refuse of the farm-yard; and, therefore, would not pay the farmer. It\r\n  was therefore, the practice of the farmers to sell the pigs to the\r\n  millers, who were enabled to fat them on another description of\r\n  refuse. Now if the labouring man kept a pig, as he had no farm-yard,\r\n  and no refuse to feed it with, he must either buy the food or steal\r\n  it. If he were honest and bought the food, his pork would, as Mr.\r\n  Whateley has stated, cost much more than he could buy it for. A pig\r\n  could only be kept on the produce of such a piece of land as a\r\n  labourer could not well cultivate whilst he attended to his other\r\n  duties. In this state of things, the temptation to pilfer for the\r\n  support of the pig was considerable. Other witnesses incidentally\r\n  corroborated this statement, and I found that with many farmers the\r\n  circumstance of a labouring man having a pig was an objection to\r\n  giving him employment. The Rev. Mr. Faithful, of Hatfield, Herts,\r\n  stated, as the result of his observation, that the keeping of pigs was\r\n  decidedly not profitable to cottagers; and such was the temptation to\r\n  steal which their possession of pigs created, that he had known a\r\n  labourer, who had a pig given to him, to steal from the donor the wood\r\n  to make its sty, the straw to litter it, and the food to feed it. The\r\n  farmers ridiculed the prevalent statements as to the small cost at\r\n  which pigs could be kept,—statements commonly made to the gentry by\r\n  roguish rustics, who profited by these delusions; a pig was not\r\n  accommodating enough to fatten on less for the cottager than for the\r\n  farmer.\r\n\r\n  A friend, who writes from Wiltshire, observes,—“I cannot make out who\r\n  it is that does fatten pigs to a profit. I asked a brewer the other\r\n  day if, with his grains, he did not make it answer; and he told me\r\n  that, on the contrary, he was always out of pocket, and only kept a\r\n  pig for the pleasure of eating his own pork. ‘Private individuals,’ he\r\n  added, ‘feed their pigs with what should rather be called spoilt malt\r\n  than grains. I cannot afford to do that; I must get out all the\r\n  goodness for my beer, and then there is not sufficient nutriment left\r\n  to fatten without the addition of things which I must purchase.’ It is\r\n  not unlikely that many persons, who fancied they kept pigs to a\r\n  profit, have fed them on this ‘spoilt malt,’ in ignorance that they\r\n  were, in fact, giving their swine valuable beer instead of refuse\r\n  grains.”\r\n\r\n  A gentleman, speaking of such appendages to labourers’ tenements in a\r\n  manufacturing district, states,—“Formerly most of our houses had them,\r\n  but they are terrible things for getting out of repair, and we are\r\n  pulling them down a good deal, and clearing the ground; for I know,\r\n  from intelligent, clear-headed workmen, that the manufacturing\r\n  families cannot grow their pork nearly so cheap as they can buy it.\r\n  The trade in bacon is quite different to what it was 20 or 30 years\r\n  ago. Now it is a great business, and the quantity of the improved\r\n  Irish pigs brought even into smallish cottages is very large. In such\r\n  villages where yard-room is not very large, swill and manure make a\r\n  terrible stink. Only such of our people keep pigs as have a fondness\r\n  for it, and as a sort of hobby, but believing that it does not pay.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 55:\r\n\r\n  The plan of Gourlier was simply to divide the receptacle into two\r\n  parts, an upper compartment and a lower. The contents of the\r\n  water-closet were discharged into the upper portion, and the water\r\n  drained into the lower, through holes pierced in the partition. In the\r\n  barrack plan there was no division in the receptacle, but, instead, a\r\n  leaden pipe pierced with holes was carried perpendicularly through the\r\n  midst of it, into which the water filtered from the receptacle, and\r\n  was conducted anywhere at pleasure. Neither of these systems obviated\r\n  two principal evils—the necessity to empty the receptacles, and the\r\n  stagnation of the water, from the night-soil, round the foundations of\r\n  the houses, from whence it worked its way up into the walls. The\r\n  annoyance always felt from the removal of night-soil in Paris, and the\r\n  ineffectual efforts of scientific men, for a long course of years, to\r\n  discover a remedy, is a sufficient proof of the imperfection of all\r\n  other methods except sewers. There has never indeed been a question\r\n  that this last system was incomparably the best. But it has not\r\n  occurred to men of science at Paris, that there could be any other\r\n  outlet for the sewers besides the Seine, and the popular apprehension\r\n  that the water would by this means be polluted, combined with the\r\n  unwillingness to sacrifice the manure, have been always viewed as\r\n  fatal objections.—_Translator._\r\n\r\nFootnote 56:\r\n\r\n  The disinfection is produced by mixing the night-soil with calcined\r\n  mud, or burned turf, or saw-dust, or refuse tan, and various other\r\n  substances. A commission of the Conseil de Salubrité found that a\r\n  large barrel of fecal matter was deprived of all smell in five minutes\r\n  by this process; and even putrefied entrails, the severest test by\r\n  which it could be tried, yielded equally to its influence. The\r\n  commission, however, doubted the success of the application where the\r\n  water was in large proportions.—_Translator._\r\n\r\nFootnote 57:\r\n\r\n  Classes Dangereuses, tom. ii., p. 126.\r\n\r\nFootnote 58:\r\n\r\n  Parent Duchâtelet, de la Prostitution, tom. i. p. 504.\r\n\r\nFootnote 59:\r\n\r\n  Classes Dangereuses, tom. i., p. 135.\r\n\r\nFootnote 60:\r\n\r\n  Even in case of the existence of water companies for the supply of\r\n  towns, there should still be public springs or wells, which would\r\n  furnish at least the absolutely necessary quantity of water, free of\r\n  _all_ expense. In this case, any one who wished to have greater\r\n  abundance, or wished the water to be introduced into his house, might\r\n  have it by paying for it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 61:\r\n\r\n  The instances of towns having gained very essentially by drainage are\r\n  Stuttgard, which has, in consequence, entirely lost a peculiar endemic\r\n  fever; and Pavia which, by the filling up of the city ditches, has had\r\n  its average duration of life much raised.\r\n\r\nFootnote 62:\r\n\r\n  Supposing the number to be 1½ daily out of 170, that would give little\r\n  more than half a week’s sickness yearly to each individual employed.\r\n  This is a very low average. The sickness found to prevail in ordinary\r\n  times amongst the labouring population of two parishes in Westminster\r\n  was at the rate of between 5 and 6 days to each individual. The\r\n  sickness of the Metropolitan Police is 10½ per annum to each\r\n  individual. The proportionate mortality of 13 annually out of 550 is 1\r\n  to 42, which it will also be perceived, on reference to the standards\r\n  previously given, is a low proportion of mortality for a manufacturing\r\n  population.\r\n\r\nFootnote 63:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Currie’s Medical Reports, chap. xxii. Liverpool, 1797.\r\n\r\nFootnote 64:\r\n\r\n  Formerly the mortality on board convict ships amounted to 50 and even\r\n  60 per cent. during the voyage; under the more recent arrangements\r\n  they have amounted only to about 1½ per cent.—E. C.\r\n\r\nFootnote 65:\r\n\r\n  Ten has been the average deaths, taking the last three years.\r\n\r\nFootnote 66:\r\n\r\n  I am of opinion that this Table does not afford sufficient data to\r\n  warrant general conclusions being deduced from it after the age of 36,\r\n  as the number of prisoners above that age is too small. In proof of\r\n  this it may be stated that one person experienced 18 days’ sickness\r\n  out of the 30 days in the class from 41 to 46, and that another had 18\r\n  days’ sickness out of the 36 in the class from 56 to 61, while in the\r\n  class 76 to 81, one person experienced 3 days, being the whole\r\n  sickness.
