Some\r\nof these have never before been made generally known, while others\r\nhave passed out of mind, being effaced from our memories by subsequent\r\nevents of a similar kind, which, though really of less magnitude and\r\nimportance, have, in the perspective of time, appeared greater, because\r\nthey have occurred nearer to our own days.\r\n\r\nDreadful as was the pestilence here described, and in few countries\r\nmore so than in England, our modern historians only slightly allude to\r\nits visitation:--Hume deems a single paragraph sufficient to devote to\r\nits notice, and Henry and Rapin are equally brief.\r\n\r\nIt may not then be unacceptable to the medical, or even to the general\r\nreader, to receive an authentic and somewhat detailed account of one of\r\nthe greatest natural calamities that ever afflicted the human race.\r\n\r\nMy chief motive, however, for translating this small work, and at\r\nthis particular period, has been a desire that, in the study of the\r\ncauses which have produced and propagated general pestilences, and of\r\nthe moral effects by which they have been followed, the most enlarged\r\nviews should be taken. The contagionist and the anti-contagionist may\r\neach find ample support for his belief in particular cases; but in\r\nthe construction of a theory sufficiently comprehensive to explain\r\nthroughout the origin and dissemination of universal disease, we shall\r\nnot only perceive the insufficiency of either doctrine, taken singly,\r\nbut after admitting the combined influence of both, shall even then\r\nfind our views too narrow, and be compelled, in our endeavours to\r\nexplain the facts, to acknowledge the existence of unknown powers,\r\nwholly unconnected either with communication by contact or atmospheric\r\ncontamination.\r\n\r\nI by no means wish it to be understood, that I have adopted the\r\nauthor’s views respecting astral and telluric influences, the former of\r\nwhich, at least, I had supposed to have been, with alchemy and magic,\r\nlong since consigned to oblivion; much less am I prepared to accede\r\nto his notion, or rather an ancient notion derived from the East and\r\nrevived by him, of an organic life in the system of the universe. We\r\nare constantly furnished with proofs, that that which affects life is\r\nnot itself alive; and whether we look to the earth for exhalations,\r\nto the air for electrical phenomena, to the heavenly bodies for an\r\ninfluence over our planet, or to all these causes combined, for the\r\nformation of some unknown principle noxious to animal existence, still,\r\nif we found our reasoning on ascertained facts, we can perceive\r\nnothing throughout this vast field for physical research which is\r\nnot evidently governed by the laws of inert matter, nothing which\r\nresembles the regular succession of birth, growth, decay, death, and\r\nregeneration, observable in organized beings. To assume, therefore,\r\ncauses of whose existence we have no proof, in order to account for\r\neffects which, after all, they do not explain, is making no real\r\nadvance in knowledge, and can scarcely be considered otherwise than an\r\nindirect method of confessing our ignorance.\r\n\r\nStill, however, I regard the author’s opinions, illustrated as they are\r\nby a series of interesting facts diligently collected from authentic\r\nsources, as, at least, worthy of examination before we reject them, and\r\nvaluable, as furnishing extensive data on which to build new theories.\r\n\r\nI have another, perhaps I may be allowed to say a better, motive for\r\nlaying before my countrymen this narrative of the sufferings of past\r\nages,--that by comparing them with those of our own time, we may be\r\nmade the more sensible how lightly the chastening hand of Providence\r\nhas fallen on the present generation, and how much reason, therefore,\r\nwe have to feel grateful for the mercy shewn us.\r\n\r\nThe publication has, with this view, been purposely somewhat delayed,\r\nin order that it might appear at a moment when it is to be presumed\r\nthat men’s thoughts will be especially directed to the approaching\r\nhour of public thanksgiving, and when a knowledge of that which they\r\nhave escaped, as well as of that which they have suffered, may tend to\r\nheighten their devotional feelings on that solemn occasion.\r\n\r\nWhen we learn that, in the fourteenth century, one quarter, at least,\r\nof the population of the old world was swept away in the short space of\r\nfour years, and that some countries, England among the rest, lost more\r\nthan double that proportion of their inhabitants in the course of a few\r\nmonths, we may well congratulate ourselves that our visitation has not\r\nbeen like theirs, and shall not justly merit ridicule, if we offer our\r\nhumble thanks to the “Creator and Preserver of all mankind” for our\r\ndeliverance.\r\n\r\nNor would it disgrace our feelings, if, in expiation of the abuse and\r\nobloquy not long since so lavishly bestowed by the public, we should\r\nentertain some slight sense of gratitude towards those members of\r\nthe community, who were engaged, at the risk of their lives and the\r\nsacrifice of their personal interests, in endeavouring to arrest the\r\nprogress of the evil, and to mitigate the sufferings of their fellow\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nI have added, at the close of the Appendix, some extracts from a scarce\r\nlittle work in black letter, called “A Boke or Counseill against the\r\nDisease commonly called the Sweate or Sweatyng Sicknesse,” published by\r\nCaius in 1552. This was written three years before his Latin treatise\r\non the same subject, and is so quaint, and, at the same time, so\r\nillustrative of the opinions of his day, and even of those of the\r\nfourteenth century, on the causes of universal diseases, that the\r\npassages which I have quoted will not fail to afford some amusement as\r\nwell as instruction. If I have been tempted to reprint more of this\r\ncurious production than was necessary to my primary object, it has been\r\nfrom a belief that it would be generally acceptable to the reader to\r\ngather some particulars regarding the mode of living in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and to observe the author’s animadversions on the degeneracy\r\nand credulity of the age in which he lived. His advice on the choice of\r\na medical attendant cannot be too strongly recommended, at least _by a\r\nphysician_; and his warning against quackery, particularly the quackery\r\nof _painters_, who “scorne (_quære_ score?) you behind your backs with\r\ntheir medicines, so filthy that I am ashamed to name them,” seems quite\r\nprophetic.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I beg to acknowledge the obligation which I owe to my\r\nfriend Mr. H. E. Lloyd, whose intimate acquaintance with the German\r\nlanguage and literature will, I hope, be received as a sufficient\r\npledge that no very important errors remain in a translation which he\r\nhas kindly revised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe here find an important page of the history of the world laid open\r\nto our view. It treats of a convulsion of the human race, unequalled\r\nin violence and extent. It speaks of incredible disasters, of despair\r\nand unbridled demoniacal passions. It shews us the abyss of general\r\nlicentiousness, in consequence of an universal pestilence, which\r\nextended from China to Iceland and Greenland.\r\n\r\nThe inducement to unveil this image of an age, long since gone by,\r\nis evident. A new pestilence has attained almost an equal extent,\r\nand though less formidable, has partly produced, partly indicated,\r\nsimilar phenomena. Its causes and its diffusion over Asia and Europe,\r\ncall on us to take a comprehensive view of it, because it leads to an\r\ninsight into the organism of the world, in which the sum of organic\r\nlife is subject to the great powers of Nature. Now, human knowledge\r\nis not yet sufficiently advanced, to discover the connexion between\r\nthe processes which occur above, and those which occur below, the\r\nsurface of the earth, or even fully to explore the laws of nature, an\r\nacquaintance with which would be required, far less to apply them to\r\ngreat phenomena, in which one spring sets a thousand others in motion.\r\n\r\nOn this side, therefore, such a point of view is not to be found, if\r\nwe would not lose ourselves in the wilderness of conjectures, of which\r\nthe world is already too full: but it may be found in the ample and\r\nproductive field of historical research.\r\n\r\nHistory--that mirror of human life in all its bearings, offers, even\r\nfor general pestilences, an inexhaustible, though scarcely explored,\r\nmine of facts; here too it asserts its dignity, as the philosophy of\r\nreality delighting in truth.\r\n\r\nIt is conformable to its spirit to conceive general pestilences as\r\nevents affecting the whole world, to explain their occurrences by the\r\ncomparison of what is similar, by which the facts speak for themselves,\r\nbecause they appear to have proceeded from the higher laws which govern\r\nthe progression of the existence of mankind. A cosmical origin and\r\nconvulsive excitement, productive of the most important consequences\r\namong the nations subject to them, are the most striking features to\r\nwhich history points in all general pestilences. The latter, however,\r\nassume very different forms, as well in their attacks on the general\r\norganism, as in their diffusion; and in this respect a development from\r\nform to form, in the course of centuries, is manifest, so that the\r\nhistory of the world is divided into grand periods in which positively\r\ndefined pestilences prevailed. As far as our chronicles extend, more or\r\nless certain information can be obtained respecting them.\r\n\r\nBut this part of medical history, which has such a manifold and\r\npowerful influence over the history of the world, is yet in its\r\ninfancy. For the honor of that science which should everywhere guide\r\nthe actions of mankind, we are induced to express a wish, that it may\r\nfind room to flourish amidst the rank vegetation with which the field\r\nof German medical science is unhappily encumbered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat Omnipotence which has called the world with all its living\r\ncreatures into one animated being, especially reveals himself in\r\nthe desolation of great pestilences. The powers of creation come\r\ninto violent collision; the sultry dryness of the atmosphere; the\r\nsubterraneous thunders; the mist of overflowing waters, are the\r\nharbingers of destruction. Nature is not satisfied with the ordinary\r\nalternations of life and death, and the Destroying Angel waves over man\r\nand beast his flaming sword.\r\n\r\nThese revolutions are performed in vast cycles, which the spirit of\r\nman, limited as it is, to a narrow circle of perception, is unable\r\nto explore. They are, however, greater terrestrial events than any of\r\nthose which proceed from the discord, the distress or the passions of\r\nnations. By annihilations they awaken new life; and when the tumult\r\nabove and below the earth is past, nature is renovated, and the\r\nmind awakens from torpor and depression to the consciousness of an\r\nintellectual existence.\r\n\r\nWere it in any degree within the power of human research to draw up,\r\nin a vivid and connected form, an historical sketch of such mighty\r\nevents, after the manner of the historians of wars and battles, and the\r\nmigrations of nations, we might then arrive at clear views with respect\r\nto the mental development of the human race, and the ways of Providence\r\nwould be more plainly discernible. It would then be demonstrable, that\r\nthe mind of nations is deeply affected by the destructive conflict of\r\nthe powers of nature, and that great disasters lead to striking changes\r\nin general civilization. For all that exists in man, whether good or\r\nevil, is rendered conspicuous by the presence of great danger. His\r\ninmost feelings are roused--the thought of self-preservation masters\r\nhis spirit--self denial is put to severe proof, and wherever darkness\r\nand barbarism prevail, there the affrighted mortal flies to the idols\r\nof his superstition, and all laws, human and divine, are criminally\r\nviolated.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with a general law of nature, such a state of excitement,\r\nbrings about a change, beneficial or detrimental, according to\r\ncircumstances, so that nations either attain a higher degree of moral\r\nworth, or sink deeper in ignorance and vice. All this, however, takes\r\nplace upon a much grander scale than through the ordinary vicissitudes\r\nof war and peace, or the rise and fall of empires, because the powers\r\nof nature themselves produce plagues, and subjugate the human will,\r\nwhich, in the contentions of nations, alone predominates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE DISEASE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most memorable example of what has been advanced, is afforded\r\nby a great pestilence of the fourteenth century, which desolated\r\nAsia, Europe, and Africa, and of which the people yet preserve the\r\nremembrance in gloomy traditions. It was an oriental plague, marked by\r\ninflammatory boils and tumors of the glands, such as break out in no\r\nother febrile disease. On account of these inflammatory boils, and from\r\nthe black spots, indicatory of a putrid decomposition, which appeared\r\nupon the skin, it was called in Germany and in the northern kingdoms\r\nof Europe, _the Black Death_, and in Italy, la Mortalega Grande, _the\r\nGreat Mortality_.[1]\r\n\r\n  [1] La Mortalega Grande. _Matth. de Griffonibus._ Muratori.

Meibom.\r\n\r\nFew testimonies are presented to us respecting its symptoms and its\r\ncourse, yet these are sufficient to throw light upon the form of the\r\nmalady, and they are worthy of credence, from their coincidence with\r\nthe signs of the same disease in modern times.\r\n\r\nThe imperial writer, Kantakusenos,[2] whose own son, Andronikus, died\r\nof this plague in Constantinople, notices great imposthumes[3] of\r\nthe thighs and arms of those affected, which, when opened, afforded\r\nrelief by the discharge of an offensive matter. Buboes, which are the\r\ninfallible signs of the oriental plague, are thus plainly indicated,\r\nfor he makes separate mention of smaller boils on the arms and in the\r\nface, as also in other parts of the body, and clearly distinguishes\r\nthese from the blisters,[4] which are no less produced by plague in all\r\nits forms. In many cases, black spots[5] broke out all over the body,\r\neither single, or united and confluent.\r\n\r\n  [2] _Joann Cantacuzen_ Historiar, L. IV. c. 8. Ed. Paris, p. 730. 5.\r\n  The ex-emperor has indeed copied some passages from Thucydides, as\r\n  _Sprengel_ justly observes, (Appendix to the Geschichte der Medicin.\r\n  Vol. 1. H. I. S. 73.) though this was most probably only for the\r\n  sake of rounding a period. This is no detriment to his credibility,\r\n  because his statements accord with the other accounts.\r\n\r\n  [3] Αποσάσεις μεγάλαι.\r\n\r\n  [4] Μελαίναι φλυχτίδες.\r\n\r\n  [5] ὤσπερ σιγματα μέλανα.\r\n\r\nThese symptoms were not all found in every case. In many, one alone was\r\nsufficient to cause death, while some patients recovered, contrary to\r\nexpectation, though afflicted with all. Symptoms of cephalic affection\r\nwere frequent; many patients became stupified and fell into a deep\r\nsleep, losing also their speech from palsy of the tongue; others\r\nremained sleepless and without rest. The fauces and tongue were black,\r\nand as if suffused with blood; no beverage would assuage their burning\r\nthirst, so that their sufferings continued without alleviation until\r\nterminated by death, which many in their despair accelerated with their\r\nown hands. Contagion was evident, for attendants caught the disease of\r\ntheir relations and friends, and many houses in the capital were bereft\r\neven of their last inhabitant. Thus far the ordinary circumstances only\r\nof the oriental plague occurred. Still deeper sufferings, however,\r\nwere connected with this pestilence, such as have not been felt at\r\nother times; the organs of respiration were seized with a putrid\r\ninflammation; a violent pain in the chest attacked the patient; blood\r\nwas expectorated, and the breath diffused a pestiferous odour.\r\n\r\nIn the West, the following were the predominating symptoms on the\r\neruption of this disease.[6] An ardent fever, accompanied by an\r\nevacuation of blood, proved fatal in the first three days. It appears\r\nthat buboes and inflammatory boils did not at first come out at all,\r\nbut that the disease, in the form of carbuncular (_anthraxartigen_)\r\naffection of the lungs, effected the destruction of life before the\r\nother symptoms were developed.\r\n\r\n  [6] _Guidon de Cauliaco_ Chirurgia. Tract 11. c. 5. p. 113. Ed.\r\n  Lugdun, 1572.\r\n\r\nThus did the plague rage in Avignon for six or eight weeks, and the\r\npestilential breath of the sick, who expectorated blood, caused a\r\nterrible contagion far and near; for even the vicinity of those\r\nwho had fallen ill of plague was certain death;[7] so that parents\r\nabandoned their infected children, and all the ties of kindred were\r\ndissolved. After this period, buboes in the axilla and in the groin,\r\nand inflammatory boils all over the body, made their appearance; but it\r\nwas not until seven months afterwards that some patients recovered with\r\nmatured buboes, as in the ordinary milder form of plague.\r\n\r\n  [7] Et fuit tantae contagiositatis specialiter quae fuit cum\r\n  sputo sanguinis, quod non solum morando, sed etiam inspiciendo\r\n  unus recipiebat ab alio: intantum quod gentes moriebantur sine\r\n  servitoribus, et sepeliebantur sine sacerdotibus, pater non visitabat\r\n  filium, nec filius patrem: charitas erat mortua, spes prostrata.\r\n\r\nSuch is the report of the courageous Guy de Chauliac, who vindicated\r\nthe honor of medicine, by bidding defiance to danger; boldly and\r\nconstantly assisting the affected, and disdaining the excuse of\r\nhis colleagues, who held the Arabian notion, that medical aid was\r\nunavailing, and that the contagion justified flight. He saw the plague\r\ntwice in Avignon, first in the year 1348, from January to August, and\r\nthen twelve years later, in the autumn, when it returned from Germany,\r\nand for nine months spread general distress and terror. The first time\r\nit raged chiefly among the poor, but in the year 1360, more among the\r\nhigher classes. It now also destroyed a great many children, whom it\r\nhad formerly spared, and but few women.\r\n\r\nThe like was seen in Egypt.[8] Here also inflammation of the lungs was\r\npredominant, and destroyed quickly and infallibly, with burning heat\r\nand expectoration of blood. Here too the breath of the sick spread a\r\ndeadly contagion, and human aid was as vain as it was destructive to\r\nthose who approached the infected.\r\n\r\n  [8] _Deguignes_, Histoire générale des Huns, des Turcs, des Moguls,\r\n  &c. Tom. IV. Paris 1758. 4to. p. 226.\r\n\r\nBoccacio, who was an eye-witness of its incredible fatality in\r\nFlorence, the seat of the revival of science, gives a more lively\r\ndescription of the attack of the disease than his non-medical\r\ncontemporaries.[9]\r\n\r\n  [9] Decameron Giorn. I. Introd.\r\n\r\nIt commenced here, not as in the East, with bleeding at the nose, a\r\nsure sign of inevitable death; but there took place at the beginning,\r\nboth in men and women, tumours in the groin and in the axilla, varying\r\nin circumference up to the size of an apple or an egg, and called\r\nby the people, pest-boils (gavoccioli). Then there appeared similar\r\ntumours indiscriminately over all parts of the body, and black or blue\r\nspots came out on the arms or thighs, or on other parts, either single\r\nand large, or small and thickly studded. These spots proved equally\r\nfatal with the pest-boils, which had been from the first regarded as\r\na sure sign of death.[10] No power of medecine brought relief--almost\r\nall died within the first three days, some sooner, some later, after\r\nthe appearance of these signs, and for the most part entirely without\r\nfever[11] or other symptoms. The plague spread itself with the greater\r\nfury, as it communicated from the sick to the healthy, like fire among\r\ndry and oily fuel, and even contact with the clothes and other articles\r\nwhich had been used by the infected, seemed to induce the disease. As\r\nit advanced, not only men, but animals fell sick and shortly expired,\r\nif they had touched things belonging to the diseased or dead. Thus\r\nBoccacio himself saw two hogs on the rags of a person who had died of\r\nplague, after staggering about for a short time, fall down dead, as\r\nif they had taken poison. In other places, multitudes of dogs, cats,\r\nfowls and other animals, fell victims to the contagion;[12] and it is\r\nto be presumed that other epizootes among animals likewise took place,\r\nalthough the ignorant writers of the fourteenth century are silent on\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\n  [10] From this period black petechiæ have always been considered as\r\n  fatal in the plague.\r\n\r\n  [11] A very usual circumstance in plague epidemics.\r\n\r\n  [12] _Auger de Biterris_, Vitae Romanor. pontificum, _Muratori_\r\n  Scriptor. rer.

The infallible signs of the oriental bubo-plague with\r\nits inevitable contagion were found there as everywhere else; but the\r\nmortality was not nearly so great as in the other parts of Europe.[13]\r\nThe accounts do not all make mention of the spitting of blood, the\r\ndiagnostic symptom of this fatal pestilence; we are not, however,\r\nthence to conclude that there was any considerable mitigation or\r\nmodification of the disease, for we must not only take into account\r\nthe defectiveness of the chronicles, but that isolated testimonies are\r\noften contradicted by many others. Thus, the chronicles of Strasburg,\r\nwhich only take notice of boils and glandular swellings in the axillæ\r\nand groins,[14] are opposed by another account, according to which the\r\nmortal spitting of blood was met with in Germany;[15] but this again is\r\nrendered suspicious, as the narrator postpones the death of those who\r\nwere thus affected, to the sixth, and (even the) eighth day, whereas,\r\nno other author sanctions so long a course of the disease; and even in\r\nStrasburg, where a mitigation of the plague may, with most probability,\r\nbe assumed, since in the year 1349, only 16,000 people were carried\r\noff, the generality expired by the third or fourth day.[16] In Austria,\r\nand especially in Vienna, the plague was fully as malignant as any\r\nwhere, so that the patients who had red spots and black boils, as well\r\nas those afflicted with tumid glands, died about the third day;[17]\r\nand lastly, very frequent sudden deaths occurred on the coasts of the\r\nNorth Sea and in Westphalia, without any further development of the\r\nmalady.[18]\r\n\r\n  [13] Contin. altera Chronici _Guillelmi de Nangis_ in _d’Acher_,\r\n  Spicilegium sive Collectio Veterum Scriptorum, &c.

Many were struck,\r\nas if by lightning, and died on the spot, and this more frequently\r\namong the young and strong than the old; patients with enlarged glands\r\nin the axillæ and groins scarcely survived two or three days; and no\r\nsooner did these fatal signs appear, than they bid adieu to the world,\r\nand sought consolation only in the absolution which Pope Clement VI.\r\npromised them in the hour of death.[19]\r\n\r\n  [19] _Guillelmus de Nangis._\r\n\r\nIn England the malady appeared, as at Avignon, with spitting of blood,\r\nand with the same fatality, so that the sick who were afflicted\r\neither with this symptom or with vomiting of blood, died in some cases\r\nimmediately, in others within twelve hours, or at the latest, in two\r\ndays.[20] The inflammatory boils and buboes in the groins and axillæ\r\nwere recognised at once as prognosticating a fatal issue, and those\r\nwere past all hope of recovery in whom they arose in numbers all over\r\nthe body. It was not till towards the close of the plague that they\r\nventured to open, by incision, these hard and dry boils, when matter\r\nflowed from them in small quantity, and thus, by compelling nature to\r\na critical suppuration, many patients were saved. Every spot which the\r\nsick had touched, their breath, their clothes, spread the contagion;\r\nand, as in all other places, the attendants and friends who were either\r\nblind to their danger or heroically despised it, fell a sacrifice\r\nto their sympathy. Even the eyes of the patient were considered as\r\nsources of contagion,[21] which had the power of acting at a distance,\r\nwhether on account of their unwonted lustre or the distortion which\r\nthey always suffer in plague, or whether in conformity with an ancient\r\nnotion, according to which the sight was considered as the bearer of a\r\ndemoniacal enchantment. Flight from infected cities seldom availed the\r\nfearful, for the germ of the disease adhered to them, and they fell\r\nsick, remote from assistance, in the solitude of their country houses.\r\n\r\n  [20] _Ant.

Probably few places\r\nescaped, perhaps not any; for the annals of contemporaries report, that\r\nthroughout the land only a tenth part of the inhabitants remained\r\nalive.[22]\r\n\r\n  [22] _Barnes_, who has given a lively picture of the black plague, in\r\n  England, taken from the Registers of the 14th century, describes the\r\n  external symptoms in the following terms: knobs or swellings in the\r\n  groin or under the arm-pits, called kernels, biles, blains, blisters,\r\n  pimples, wheals or plague-sores.

The sailors found no refuge in\r\ntheir ships; and vessels were often seen driving about on the ocean and\r\ndrifting on shore, whose crews had perished to the last man.[23]\r\n\r\n  [23] _Torfaeus_, Historia rerum Norvegicarum.

Amstelod. 1631. fol.) who has given only a general account\r\n  of the plague in Denmark, and nothing respecting its symptoms.\r\n\r\nIn Poland the infected were attacked with spitting of blood, and died\r\nin a few days in such vast numbers, that, as it has been affirmed,\r\nscarcely a fourth of the inhabitants were left.[24]\r\n\r\n  [24] _Dlugoss_, S. Longini Histor. polonic. L. xii. Lips. 1711. fol.\r\n  T. 1. p. 1086.\r\n\r\nFinally, in Russia the plague appeared two years later than in Southern\r\nEurope; yet here again, with the same symptoms as elsewhere. Russian\r\ncontemporaries have recorded that it began with rigor, heat, and\r\ndarting pain in the shoulders and back; that it was accompanied by\r\nspitting of blood, and terminated fatally in two, or at most, three\r\ndays. It is not till the year 1360, that we find buboes mentioned as\r\noccurring in the neck, in the axillæ and in the groins, which are\r\nstated to have broken out when the spitting of blood had continued some\r\ntime. According to the experience of Western Europe, however, it cannot\r\nbe assumed that these symptoms did not appear at an earlier period.[25]\r\n\r\n  [25] _W. M. Richter_, Geschichte der Medicin in Russland. Moskwa,\r\n  1813. 8. p. 215. _Richter_ has taken his information on the black\r\n  plague in Russia, from Authentic Russian MSS.\r\n\r\nThus much, from authentic sources, on the nature of the Black Death.\r\nThe descriptions which have been communicated contain, with a few\r\nunimportant exceptions, all the symptoms of the oriental plague which\r\nhave been observed in more modern times. No doubt can obtain on this\r\npoint. The facts are placed clearly before our eyes. We must, however,\r\nbear in mind, that this violent disease does not always appear in the\r\nsame form, and that while the essence of the poison which it produces,\r\nand which is separated so abundantly from the body of the patient,\r\nremains unchanged, it is proteiform in its varieties, from the almost\r\nimperceptible vesicle, unaccompanied by fever, which exists for some\r\ntime before it extends its poison inwardly, and then excites fever and\r\nbuboes, to the fatal form in which carbuncular inflammations fall upon\r\nthe most important viscera.\r\n\r\nSuch was the form which the plague assumed in the 14th century, for\r\nthe accompanying chest affection which appeared in all the countries\r\nwhereof we have received any account, cannot, on a comparison with\r\nsimilar and familiar symptoms, be considered as any other than the\r\ninflammation of the lungs of modern medicine,[26] a disease which at\r\npresent only appears sporadically, and, owing to a putrid decomposition\r\nof the fluids, is probably combined with hemorrhages from the vessels\r\nof the lungs. Now, as every carbuncle, whether it be cutaneous or\r\ninternal, generates in abundance the matter of contagion which has\r\ngiven rise to it, so, therefore, must the breath of the affected\r\nhave been poisonous in this plague, and on this account its power\r\nof contagion wonderfully increased; wherefore the opinion appears\r\nincontrovertible, that owing to the accumulated numbers of the\r\ndiseased, not only individual chambers and houses, but whole cities\r\nwere infected, which, moreover, in the middle ages, were, with few\r\nexceptions, narrowly built, kept in a filthy state, and surrounded with\r\nstagnant ditches.[27] Flight was, in consequence, of no avail to the\r\ntimid; for even though they had sedulously avoided all communication\r\nwith the diseased and the suspected, yet their clothes were saturated\r\nwith the pestiferous atmosphere, and every inspiration imparted to\r\nthem the seeds of the destructive malady, which, in the greater number\r\nof cases, germinated with but too much fertility. Add to which, the\r\nusual propagation of the plague through clothes, beds, and a thousand\r\nother things to which the pestilential poison adheres,--a propagation,\r\nwhich, from want of caution, must have been infinitely multiplied;\r\nand since articles of this kind, removed from the access of air, not\r\nonly retain the matter of contagion for an indefinite period, but also\r\nincrease its activity and engender it like a living being, frightful\r\nill-consequences followed for many years after the first fury of the\r\npestilence was past.\r\n\r\n  [26] Compare on this point, _Ballings_ treatise “Zur Diagnostik der\r\n  Lungenerweichung.” Vol. XVI. ii. 3. p. 257 of lit. Annalen der ges.\r\n  Heilkunde.\r\n\r\n  [27] It is expressly ascertained with respect to Avignon and Paris,\r\n  that uncleanliness of the streets increased the plague considerably.\r\n  _Raim. Chalin de Vinario._\r\n\r\nThe affection of the stomach, often mentioned in vague terms, and\r\noccasionally as a vomiting of blood, was doubtless only a subordinate\r\nsymptom, even if it be admitted that actual hematemesis did occur. For\r\nthe difficulty of distinguishing a flow of blood from the stomach, from\r\na pulmonic expectoration of that fluid, is, to non-medical men, even in\r\ncommon cases, not inconsiderable. How much greater then must it have\r\nbeen in so terrible a disease, where assistants could not venture to\r\napproach the sick without exposing themselves to certain death? Only\r\ntwo medical descriptions of the malady have reached us, the one by the\r\nbrave _Guy de Chauliac_, the other by _Raymond Chalin de Vinario_, a\r\nvery experienced scholar, who was well versed in the learning of his\r\ntime. The former takes notice only of fatal coughing of blood; the\r\nlatter, besides this, notices epistaxis, hematuria and fluxes of blood\r\nfrom the bowels, as symptoms of such decided and speedy mortality, that\r\nthose patients in whom they were observed, usually died on the same or\r\nthe following day.[28]\r\n\r\n  [28] _De Peste_ Libri tres, opera _Jacobi Dalechampii_ in lucem\r\n  editi. Lugdani, 1552. 16. p. 35. _Dalechamp_ has only improved the\r\n  language of this work, adding nothing to it but a preface in the\r\n  form of two letters. _Raymond Chalin de Vinario_ was contemporary\r\n  with _Guy de Chauliac_ at Avignon. He enjoyed a high reputation,\r\n  and was in very affluent circumstances. He often makes mention of\r\n  cardinals and high officers of the papal court, whom he had treated;\r\n  and it is even probable, though not certain, that he was physician\r\n  to Clement VI. (1342--1352), Innocent VI. (1352--) and Urban the V.\r\n  (1362--1370). He and _Guy de Chauliac_ never mention each other.\r\n\r\nThat a vomiting of blood may not, here and there, have taken\r\nplace, perhaps have been even prevalent in many places, is, from a\r\nconsideration of the nature of the disease, by no means to be denied;\r\nfor every putrid decomposition of the fluids, begets a tendency to\r\nhemorrhages of all kinds. Here, however, it is a question of historical\r\ncertainty, which, after these doubts, is by no means established. Had\r\nnot so speedy a death followed the expectoration of blood, we should\r\ncertainly have received more detailed intelligence respecting other\r\nhemorrhages; but the malady had no time to extend its effects further\r\nover the extremities of the vessels. After its first fury, however,\r\nwas spent, the pestilence passed into the usual febrile form of the\r\noriental plague. Internal, carbuncular inflammations no longer took\r\nplace, and hemorrhages became phenomena, no more essential in this\r\nthan they are in any other febrile disorders. Chalin, who observed\r\nnot only the _great mortality_ of 1348, and the plague of 1360, but\r\nalso that of 1373 and 1382, speaks moreover of _affections of the\r\nthroat_, and describes the _black spots_ of plague patients more\r\nsatisfactorily than any of his cotemporaries. The former appeared but\r\nin few cases, and consisted in carbuncular inflammation of the gullet,\r\nwith a difficulty of swallowing, even to suffocation, to which, in\r\nsome instances, was added inflammation of the ceruminous glands of\r\nthe ears, with tumours, producing great deformity. Such patients, as\r\nwell as others, were affected with expectoration of blood; but they\r\ndid not usually die before the sixth, and sometimes, even so late as\r\nthe fourteenth day.[29] The same occurrence, it is well known, is not\r\nuncommon in other pestilences; as also blisters on the surface of the\r\nbody, in different places, in the vicinity of which, tumid glands and\r\ninflammatory boils, surrounded by discoloured and black streaks,\r\narose, and thus indicated the reception of the poison. These streaked\r\nspots were called, by an apt comparison, _the girdle_, and this\r\nappearance was justly considered extremely dangerous.[30]\r\n\r\n  [29] _Dalechamp_, p. 205--where, and at pp. 32–36, the\r\n  plague-eruptions are mentioned in the usual indefinite terms:\r\n  Exanthemata viridia, cærulea, nigra, rubra, lata, diffusa, velut\r\n  signata punctis, &c.\r\n\r\n  [30] “Pestilentis morbi gravissimum symptoma est, quod zonam vulgo\r\n  nuncupant. Ea sic fit: Pustulæ nonnunquam per febres pestilentes\r\n  fuscæ, nigræ, lividæ existunt, in partibus corporis a glandularum\r\n  emissariis sejunctis, ut in femore, tibia, capite, brachio, humeris,\r\n  quarum fervore et caliditate succi corporis attracti, glandulas\r\n  in trajectione replent, et attollunt, unde bubones fiunt atque\r\n  carbunculi. _Ab iis tanquam solidus quidam nervus in partem vicinam\r\n  distentam ac veluti convulsione rigentem producitur, puta Brachium\r\n  vel tibiam, nunc rubens, nunc fuscus, nunc obscurior, nunc virens,\r\n  nunc Iridis colore, duos vel quatuor digitos latus._ Hujus summo, qua\r\n  desinit in emissarium, plerumque tuberculum pestilens visitur, altero\r\n  vero extremo, qua in propinquum membrum porrigitur, carbunculus. Hoc\r\n  scilicet malum vulgus zonam cinctumve nominat, periculosum minus, cum\r\n  hic tuberculo, illic carbunculo terminatur, quam si tuberculum in\r\n  capite solum emineat.” p. 198.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCAUSES.--SPREAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn enquiry into the causes of the Black Death, will not be without\r\nimportant results in the study of the plagues which have visited\r\nthe world, although it cannot advance beyond generalisation without\r\nentering upon a field hitherto uncultivated, and, to this hour,\r\nentirely unknown. Mighty revolutions in the organism of the earth, of\r\nwhich we have credible information, had preceded it. From China to the\r\nAtlantic, the foundations of the earth were shaken,--throughout Asia\r\nand Europe the atmosphere was in commotion, and endangered, by its\r\nbaneful influence, both vegetable and animal life.\r\n\r\nThe series of these great events began in the year 1333, fifteen years\r\nbefore the plague broke out in Europe: they first appeared in China.\r\nHere a parching drought, accompanied by famine, commenced in the tract\r\nof country watered by the rivers Kiang and Hoai. This was followed\r\nby such violent torrents of rain, in and about Kingsai, at that time\r\nthe capital of the Empire, that, according to tradition, more than\r\n400,000 people perished in the floods. Finally, the mountain Tsincheou\r\nfell in, and vast clefts were formed in the earth. In the succeeding\r\nyear (1334), passing over fabulous traditions, the neighbourhood\r\nof Canton was visited by inundations; whilst in Tche, after an\r\nunexampled drought, a plague arose, which is said to have carried\r\noff about 5,000,000 of people. A few months afterwards an earthquake\r\nfollowed, at and near Kingsai; and subsequent to the falling in of the\r\nmountains of Ki-ming-chan, a lake was formed of more than a hundred\r\nleagues in circumference, where, again, thousands found their grave.\r\nIn Hou-kouang and Ho-nan, a drought prevailed for five months; and\r\ninnumerable swarms of locusts destroyed the vegetation; while famine\r\nand pestilence, as usual, followed in their train. Connected accounts\r\nof the condition of Europe before this great catastrophe, are not to be\r\nexpected from the writers of the fourteenth century. It is remarkable,\r\nhowever, that simultaneously with a drought and renewed floods in\r\nChina, in 1336, many uncommon atmospheric phenomena, and in the winter,\r\nfrequent thunder storms, were observed in the north of France; and so\r\nearly as the eventful year of 1333, an eruption of Etna took place.[31]\r\nAccording to the Chinese annals, about 4,000,000 of people perished by\r\nfamine in the neighbourhood of Kiang in 1337; and deluges, swarms of\r\nlocusts, and an earthquake which lasted six days, caused incredible\r\ndevastation. In the same year, the first swarms of locusts appeared in\r\nFranconia, which were succeeded in the following year by myriads of\r\nthese insects. In 1338, Kingsai was visited by an earthquake of ten\r\ndays duration; at the same time France suffered from a failure in the\r\nharvest; and thenceforth, till the year 1342, there was in China, a\r\nconstant succession of inundations, earthquakes, and famines. In the\r\nsame year great floods occurred in the vicinity of the Rhine and in\r\nFrance, which could not be attributed to rain alone; for, everywhere,\r\neven on the tops of mountains, springs were seen to burst forth, and\r\ndry tracts were laid under water in an inexplicable manner. In the\r\nfollowing year, the mountain Hong-tchang, in China, fell in, and caused\r\na destructive deluge; and in Pien-tcheou and Leang-tcheou, after three\r\nmonths’ rain, there followed unheard of inundations, which destroyed\r\nseven cities. In Egypt and Syria, violent earthquakes took place; and\r\nin China they became, from this time, more and more frequent; for\r\nthey recurred, in 1344, in Ven-tcheou, where the sea overflowed in\r\nconsequence; in 1345, in Ki-tcheou, and in both the following years\r\nin Canton, with subterraneous thunder. Meanwhile, floods and famine\r\ndevastated various districts, until 1347, when the fury of the elements\r\nsubsided in China.[32]\r\n\r\n  [31] V. Hoff. Geschichte der natürlichen Veränderungen der\r\n  Erdoberfläche, T. II. p. 264. Gotha, 1824. This eruption was not\r\n  succeeded by any other in the same century, either of Etna or of\r\n  Vesuvius.\r\n\r\n  [32] Deguignes Loc. cit. p. 226, from Chinese sources.\r\n\r\nThe signs of terrestrial commotions commenced in Europe in the year\r\n1348, after the intervening districts of country in Asia had probably\r\nbeen visited in the same manner.\r\n\r\nOn the island of Cyprus, the plague from the East had already broken\r\nout; when an earthquake shook the foundations of the island, and was\r\naccompanied by so frightful a hurricane, that the inhabitants who had\r\nslain their Mahometan slaves, in order that they might not themselves\r\nbe subjugated by them, fled in dismay, in all directions. The sea\r\noverflowed--the ships were dashed to pieces on the rocks, and few\r\noutlived the terrific event, whereby this fertile and blooming island\r\nwas converted into a desert. Before the earthquake, a pestiferous wind\r\nspread so poisonous an odour, that many, being overpowered by it, fell\r\ndown suddenly and expired in dreadful agonies.[33]\r\n\r\n  [33] Deguignes Loc. cit. p. 225.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon is one of the rarest that has ever been observed, for\r\nnothing is more constant than the composition of the air; and in no\r\nrespect has nature been more careful in the preservation of organic\r\nlife. Never have naturalists discovered in the atmosphere, foreign\r\nelements, which, evident to the senses, and borne by the winds, spread\r\nfrom land to land, carrying disease over whole portions of the earth,\r\nas is recounted to have taken place in the year 1348. It is, therefore,\r\nthe more to be regretted, that in this extraordinary period, which,\r\nowing to the low condition of science, was very deficient in accurate\r\nobservers, so little that can be depended on respecting those uncommon\r\noccurrences in the air, should have been recorded. Yet, German accounts\r\nsay expressly, that a thick, stinking mist advanced from the East, and\r\nspread itself over Italy;[34] and there could be no deception in so\r\npalpable a phenomenon.[35] The credibility of unadorned traditions,\r\nhowever little they may satisfy to physical research, can scarcely be\r\ncalled in question when we consider the connexion of events; for just\r\nat this time earthquakes were more general than they had been within\r\nthe range of history. In thousands of places chasms were formed, from\r\nwhence arose noxious vapours; and as at that time natural occurrences\r\nwere transformed into miracles, it was reported, that a fiery meteor,\r\nwhich descended on the earth far in the East, had destroyed every\r\nthing within a circumference of more than a hundred leagues, infecting\r\nthe air far and wide.[36] The consequences of innumerable floods\r\ncontributed to the same effect; vast river districts had been converted\r\ninto swamps; foul vapours arose every where, increased by the odour of\r\nputrified locusts, which had never perhaps darkened the sun in thicker\r\nswarms,[37] and of countless corpses, which even in the well-regulated\r\ncountries of Europe, they knew not how to remove quickly enough out of\r\nthe sight of the living. It is probable, therefore, that the atmosphere\r\ncontained foreign, and sensibly perceptible, admixtures to a great\r\nextent, which, at least in the lower regions, could not be decomposed,\r\nor rendered ineffective by separation.\r\n\r\n  [34] There were also many locusts which had been blown into the sea\r\n  by a hurricane, and afterwards cast dead upon the shore, and produced\r\n  a noxious exhalation; and _a dense and awful fog was seen in the\r\n  heavens, rising in the East, and descending upon Italy_.

Loc. cit.\r\n\r\nNow, if we go back to the symptoms of the disease, the ardent\r\ninflammation of the lungs points out, that the organs of respiration\r\nyielded to the attack of an atmospheric poison--a poison, which (if\r\nwe admit the independent origin of the Black Plague at any one place\r\non the globe, which, under such extraordinary circumstances, it would\r\nbe difficult to doubt,) attacked the course of the circulation in as\r\nhostile a manner as that which produces inflammation of the spleen and\r\nother animal contagions that cause swelling and inflammation of the\r\nlymphatic glands.\r\n\r\nPursuing the course of these grand revolutions further, we find notice\r\nof an unexampled earthquake, which, on the 25th of January, 1348, shook\r\nGreece, Italy and the neighbouring countries. Naples, Rome, Pisa,\r\nBologna, Padua, Venice and many other cities suffered considerably:\r\nwhole villages were swallowed up. Castles, houses and churches, were\r\noverthrown, and hundreds of people were buried beneath their ruins.[38]\r\nIn Carinthia, thirty villages, together with all the churches, were\r\ndemolished; more than a thousand corpses were drawn out of the rubbish;\r\nthe city of Villach was so completely destroyed, that very few of\r\nits inhabitants were saved; and when the earth ceased to tremble, it\r\nwas found that mountains had been moved from their positions, and\r\nthat many hamlets were left in ruins.[39] It is recorded, that during\r\nthis earthquake, the wine in the casks became turbid, a statement\r\nwhich may be considered as furnishing a proof, that changes causing\r\na decomposition of the atmosphere had taken place; but if we had no\r\nother information from which the excitement of conflicting powers of\r\nnature during these commotions, might be inferred, yet scientific\r\nobservations in modern times have shewn, that the relation of the\r\natmosphere to the earth is changed by volcanic influences. Why then,\r\nmay we not, from this fact, draw retrospective inferences respecting\r\nthose extraordinary phenomena?\r\n\r\n  [38] _Giov. Villani_ Istorie Fiorentine>, L.

The consequences of\r\nfailure in the crops were soon felt, especially in Italy and the\r\nsurrounding countries, where, in this year, a rain which continued for\r\nfour months, had destroyed the seed. In the larger cities, they were\r\ncompelled, in the spring of 1347, to have recourse to a distribution\r\nof bread among the poor, particularly at Florence, where they erected\r\nlarge bake-houses, from which, in April, ninety-four thousand loaves of\r\nbread, each of twelve ounces in weight, were daily dispensed.[46] It is\r\nplain, however, that humanity could only partially mitigate the general\r\ndistress, not altogether obviate it.\r\n\r\n  [45] _Guillelm de Nanges_ Cont. alt.

Istorie Pistolesi, in _Muratori_, T. XI. p. 524. “Ne\r\n  gli anni di Chr. 1346 et 1347, fu grandissima carestia in tutta la\r\n  Christianità, in tanto, che molta genie moria di fame, e fu grande\r\n  mortalità in ogni paese del mondo.”\r\n\r\nSuch are the events which took place before the eruption of the\r\nBlack Plague in Europe. Contemporaries have explained them after\r\ntheir own manner, and have thus, like their posterity, under similar\r\ncircumstances, given a proof, that mortals possess neither senses nor\r\nintellectual powers sufficiently acute to comprehend the phenomena\r\nproduced by the earth’s organism, much less scientifically to\r\nunderstand their effects. Superstition, selfishness in a thousand\r\nforms, the presumption of the schools, laid hold of unconnected\r\nfacts. They vainly thought to comprehend the whole in the individual,\r\nand perceived not the universal spirit which, in intimate union with\r\nthe mighty powers of nature, animates the movements of all existence,\r\nand permits not any phenomenon to originate from isolated causes. To\r\nattempt, five centuries after that age of desolation, to point out the\r\ncauses of a cosmical commotion, which has never recurred to an equal\r\nextent,--to indicate scientifically the influences which called forth\r\nso terrific a poison in the bodies of men and animals, exceeds the\r\nlimits of human understanding. If we are even now unable, with all the\r\nvaried resources of an extended knowledge of nature, to define that\r\ncondition of the atmosphere by which pestilences are generated, still\r\nless can we pretend to reason retrospectively from the nineteenth\r\nto the fourteenth century; but if we take a general view of the\r\noccurrences, that century will give us copious information, and, as\r\napplicable to all succeeding times, of high importance.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of connected natural phenomena, from East to West,\r\nthat great law of nature is plainly revealed which has so often and\r\nevidently manifested itself in the earth’s organism, as well as in\r\nthe state of nations dependent upon it. In the inmost depths of the\r\nglobe, that impulse was given in the year 1333, which in uninterrupted\r\nsuccession for six-and-twenty years shook the surface of the earth,\r\neven to the western shores of Europe. From the very beginning the air\r\npartook of the terrestrial concussion, atmospherical waters overflowed\r\nthe land, or its plants and animals perished under the scorching heat.\r\nThe insect tribe was wonderfully called into life, as if animated\r\nbeings were destined to complete the destruction which astral and\r\ntelluric powers had begun. Thus did this dreadful work of nature\r\nadvance from year to year; it was a progressive infection of the\r\nZones which exerted a powerful influence both above and beneath the\r\nsurface of the earth; and after having been perceptible in slighter\r\nindications, at the commencement of the terrestrial commotions in\r\nChina, convulsed the whole earth.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the first plague in China is unknown. We have no\r\ncertain intelligence of the disease, until it entered the western\r\ncountries of Asia. Here it shewed itself as the oriental plague with\r\ninflammation of the lungs; in which form it probably also may have\r\nbegun in China, that is to say, as a malady which spreads, more than\r\nany other, by contagion--a contagion, that, in ordinary pestilences,\r\nrequires immediate contact, and only under unfavorable circumstances\r\nof rare occurrence is communicated by the mere approach to the sick.\r\nThe share which this cause had in the spreading of the plague over\r\nthe whole earth, was certainly very great: and the opinion that the\r\nBlack Death might have been excluded from Western Europe, by good\r\nregulations, similar to those which are now in use, would have all the\r\nsupport of modern experience; provided it could be proved that this\r\nplague had been actually imported from the East; or that the oriental\r\nplague in general, as often as it appears in Europe, always has its\r\norigin in Asia or Egypt. Such a proof, however, cannot be produced\r\nso as to enforce conviction; for it would involve the impossible\r\nassumption, that either there is no essential difference in the degree\r\nof civilization of the European nations, in the most ancient and in\r\nmodern times, or that detrimental circumstances, which have yielded\r\nonly to the civilization of human society and the regular cultivation\r\nof countries, could not formerly have maintained the bubo-plague.\r\n\r\nThe plague was, however, known in Europe before nations were united\r\nby the bonds of commerce and social intercourse;[48] hence there is\r\nground for supposing that it sprung up spontaneously, in consequence\r\nof the rude manner of living and the uncultivated state of the earth;\r\ninfluences which peculiarly favor the origin of severe diseases. Now,\r\nwe need not go back to the earlier centuries, for the 14th itself,\r\nbefore it was half expired, was visited by five or six pestilences.[49]\r\n\r\n  [48] According to _Papon_, its origin is quite lost in the obscurity\r\n  of remote ages; and even before the Christian Era, we are able to\r\n  trace many references to former pestilences.

Ibid.\r\n  T. II. p. 273.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, we consider the peculiar property of the plague, that,\r\nin countries which it has once visited, it remains for a long time\r\nin a milder form, and that the epidemic influences of 1342, when it\r\nhad appeared for the last time, were particularly favorable to its\r\nunperceived continuance, till 1348, we come to the notion, that in\r\nthis eventful year also, the germs of plague existed in Southern\r\nEurope, which might be vivified by atmospherical deteriorations; and\r\nthat thus, at least in part, the Black Plague may have originated in\r\nEurope itself. The corruption of the atmosphere came from the East; but\r\nthe disease itself came not upon the wings of the wind, but was only\r\nexcited and increased by the atmosphere where it had previously existed.\r\n\r\nThis source of the Black Plague was not, however, the only one; for,\r\nfar more powerful than the excitement of the latent elements of the\r\nplague by atmospheric influences, was the effect of the contagion\r\ncommunicated from one people to another, on the great roads, and\r\nin the harbours of the Mediterranean. From China, the route of the\r\ncaravans lay to the north of the Caspian Sea, through Central Asia,\r\nto Tauris. Here ships were ready to take the produce of the East to\r\nConstantinople, the capital of commerce, and the medium of connexion\r\nbetween Asia, Europe and Africa.[50] Other caravans went from India\r\nto Asia Minor, and touched at the cities south of the Caspian Sea,\r\nand lastly, from Bagdad, through Arabia to Egypt; also the maritime\r\ncommunication on the Red Sea, from India to Arabia and Egypt, was\r\nnot inconsiderable. In all these directions contagion made its way;\r\nand doubtless, Constantinople and the harbours of Asia Minor, are to\r\nbe regarded as the foci of infection; whence it radiated to the most\r\ndistant seaports and islands.\r\n\r\n  [50] Compare _Deguignes._ Loc. cit. p. 288.\r\n\r\nTo Constantinople, the plague had been brought from the northern coast\r\nof the Black Sea,[51] after it had depopulated the countries between\r\nthose routes of commerce; and appeared as early as 1347, in Cyprus,\r\nSicily, Marseilles and some of the seaports of Italy. The remaining\r\nislands of the Mediterranean, particularly Sardinia, Corsica and\r\nMajorca, were visited in succession. Foci of contagion existed also\r\nin full activity along the whole southern coast of Europe; when, in\r\nJanuary 1348, the plague appeared in Avignon,[52] and in other cities\r\nin the south of France and north of Italy, as well as in Spain.\r\n\r\n  [51] According to the general Byzantine designation, “from the\r\n  country of the hyperborean Scythians.” _Kantakuzen._ Loc. cit.\r\n\r\n  [52] _Guid. Cauliac_, Loc. cit.\r\n\r\nThe precise days of its eruption in the individual towns, are no longer\r\nto be ascertained; but it was not simultaneous: for in Florence, the\r\ndisease appeared in the beginning of April;[53] in Cesena, the 1st\r\nof June;[54] and place after place was attacked throughout the whole\r\nyear; so that the plague, after it had passed through the whole of\r\nFrance and Germany, where, however, it did not make its ravages until\r\nthe following year, did not break out till August, in England; where\r\nit advanced so gradually, that a period of three months elapsed before\r\nit reached London.[55] The Northern Kingdoms were attacked by it in\r\n1349. Sweden, indeed, not until November of that year: almost two years\r\nafter its eruption in Avignon.[56] Poland received the plague in 1349,\r\nprobably from Germany,[57] if not from the northern countries; but in\r\nRussia, it did not make its appearance until 1351, more than three\r\nyears after it had broken out in Constantinople. Instead of advancing\r\nin a north-westerly direction from Tauris and from the Caspian Sea,\r\nit had thus made the great circuit of the Black Sea, by way of\r\nConstantinople, Southern and Central Europe, England, the Northern\r\nKingdoms and Poland, before it reached the Russian territories; a\r\nphenomenon which has not again occurred with respect to more recent\r\npestilences originating in Asia.\r\n\r\n  [53] _Matt.

A milder\r\nand a more malignant form certainly existed, and the former was\r\nnot always derived from the latter, as is to be supposed from this\r\ncircumstance--that the spitting of blood, the infallible diagnostic of\r\nthe latter, on the first breaking out of the plague, is not similarly\r\nmentioned in all the reports; and it is therefore probable, that the\r\nmilder form belonged to the native plague,--the more malignant, to\r\nthat introduced by contagion. Contagion was, however, in itself, only\r\none of many causes which gave rise to the Black Plague.\r\n\r\nThis disease was a consequence of violent commotions in the earth’s\r\norganism--if any disease of cosmical origin can be so considered. One\r\nspring set a thousand others in motion for the annihilation of living\r\nbeings, transient or permanent, of mediate or immediate effect. The\r\nmost powerful of all was contagion; for in the most distant countries\r\nwhich had scarcely yet heard the echo of the first concussion, the\r\npeople fell a sacrifice to organic poison,--the untimely offspring of\r\nvital energies thrown into violent commotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMORTALITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have no certain measure by which to estimate the ravages of the\r\nBlack Plague, if numerical statements were wanted, as in modern times.\r\nLet us go back for a moment to the 14th century. The people were yet\r\nbut little civilized. The church had indeed subdued them; but they all\r\nsuffered from the ill-consequences of their original rudeness. The\r\ndominion of the law was not yet confirmed. Sovereigns had everywhere\r\nto combat powerful enemies to internal tranquillity and security.\r\nThe cities were fortresses for their own defence. Marauders encamped\r\non the roads--The husbandman was a feodal slave, without possessions\r\nof his own.--Rudeness was general--Humanity, as yet unknown to the\r\npeople.--Witches and heretics were burned alive.--Gentle rulers were\r\ncontemned as weak;--wild passions, severity and cruelty, everywhere\r\npredominated.--Human life was little regarded.--Governments concerned\r\nnot themselves about the numbers of their subjects, for whose welfare\r\nit was incumbent on them to provide. Thus, the first requisite for\r\nestimating the loss of human life, namely, a knowledge of the amount of\r\nthe population, is altogether wanting; and, moreover, the traditional\r\nstatements of the amount of this loss, are so vague, that from this\r\nsource likewise, there is only room for probable conjecture.\r\n\r\nKairo lost daily, when the plague was raging with its greatest\r\nviolence, from 10 to 15,000; being as many as, in modern times, great\r\nplagues have carried off during their whole course. In China, more than\r\nthirteen millions are said to have died; and this is in correspondence\r\nwith the certainly exaggerated accounts from the rest of Asia. India\r\nwas depopulated. Tartary, the Tartar Kingdom of Kaptschak, Mesapotamia,\r\nSyria, Armenia, were covered with dead bodies--the Kurds fled in vain\r\nto the mountains. In Caramania and Caesarea, none were left alive. On\r\nthe roads,--in the camps,--in the caravansaries,--unburied bodies alone\r\nwere seen; and a few cities only (Arabian historians name, Maara el\r\nnooman, Schisur and Harem) remained, in an unaccountable manner, free.\r\nIn Aleppo, 500 died daily; 22,000 people, and most of the animals,\r\nwere carried off in Gaza, within six weeks. Cyprus lost almost all\r\nits inhabitants;[58] and ships without crews were often seen in the\r\nMediterranean; as afterwards in the North Sea, driving about, and\r\nspreading the plague wherever they went on shore.[59] It was reported\r\nto Pope Clement, at Avignon, that throughout the East, probably with\r\nthe exception of China, 23,840,000 people had fallen victims to the\r\nplague.[60] Considering the occurrences of the 14th and 15th centuries,\r\nwe might, on first view, suspect the accuracy of this statement. How\r\n(it might be asked) could such great wars have been carried on--such\r\npowerful efforts have been made; how could the Greek empire, only a\r\nhundred years later, have been overthrown, if the people really had\r\nbeen so utterly destroyed?\r\n\r\n  [58] _Deguignes_, Loc. cit. p. 223, f.\r\n\r\n  [59] _Matt. Villani_, Istoria, Loc. cit. p. 13.\r\n\r\n  [60] _Knighton_, in _Barnes_, Loc. cit. p. 434.\r\n\r\nThis account is nevertheless rendered credible by the ascertained fact,\r\nthat the palaces of princes are less accessible to contagious diseases,\r\nthan the dwellings of the multitude; and that in places of importance,\r\nthe influx from those districts which have suffered least, soon repairs\r\neven the heaviest losses. We must remember also, that we do not gather\r\nmuch from mere numbers without an intimate knowledge of the state of\r\nSociety. We will, therefore, confine ourselves to exhibiting some of\r\nthe more credible accounts relative to European cities.\r\n\r\n    In Florence there died of the\r\n      Black Plague                  60,000[61]\r\n    In Venice                      100,000[62]\r\n    In Marseilles, in one month     16,000[63]\r\n    In Siena                        70,000[64]\r\n    In Paris                        50,000[65]\r\n    In St. Denys                    14,000[66]\r\n    In Avignon                      60,000[67]\r\n    In Strasburg                    16,000[68]\r\n    In Lübeck                        9,000[69]\r\n    In Basle                        14,000\r\n    In Erfurt, at least             16,000\r\n    In Weimar                        5,000[70]\r\n    In Limburg                       2,500[71]\r\n    In London, at least            100,000[72]\r\n    In Norwich                      51,100[73]\r\n\r\nTo which may be added--\r\n\r\n    Franciscan Friars in Germany   124,434[74]\r\n    Minorites in Italy              30,000[75]\r\n\r\n  [61] _Jno.

Lübeck, at that time the Venice of the North, which could no\r\nlonger contain the multitudes that flocked to it, was thrown into\r\nsuch consternation on the eruption of the plague, that the citizens\r\ndestroyed themselves as if in frenzy.\r\n\r\nMerchants whose earnings and possessions were unbounded, coldly and\r\nwillingly renounced their earthly goods. They carried their treasures\r\nto monasteries and churches, and laid them at the foot of the altar;\r\nbut gold had no charms for the monks, for it brought them death. They\r\nshut their gates; yet, still it was cast to them over the convent\r\nwalls. People would brook no impediment to the last pious work to\r\nwhich they were driven by despair. When the plague ceased, men thought\r\nthey were still wandering among the dead, so appalling was the livid\r\naspect of the survivors, in consequence of the anxiety they had\r\nundergone, and the unavoidable infection of the air.[76] Many other\r\ncities probably presented a similar appearance; and it is ascertained\r\nthat a great number of small country towns and villages which have been\r\nestimated, and not too highly, at 200,000,[77] were bereft of all their\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n  [76] _Becker_, Loc. cit.\r\n\r\n  [77] _Hainr.

For although they lost their\r\nlives, evidently from contagion, and their numbers were several times\r\nrenewed, there was still no want of fresh candidates, who, strangers to\r\nthe unchristian fear of death, piously devoted themselves to their holy\r\ncalling.\r\n\r\n  [79] _Johanna_, queen of Navarre, daughter of _Louis X._, and\r\n  _Johanna_ of Burgundy, wife of king _Philip_ de Valois.\r\n\r\n  [80] _Fulco de Chanar._\r\n\r\nThe church-yards were soon unable to contain the dead,[81] and many\r\nhouses, left without inhabitants, fell to ruins.\r\n\r\n  [81] _Mich.

In Vienna, where for some time\r\n1200 inhabitants died daily,[83] the interment of corpses in the\r\nchurch-yards and within the churches, was forthwith prohibited; and\r\nthe dead were then arranged in layers, by thousands, in six large pits\r\noutside the city,[84] as had already been done in Cairo and Paris.\r\nYet, still many were secretly buried; for at all times, the people are\r\nattached to the consecrated cemeteries of their dead, and will not\r\nrenounce the customary mode of interment.\r\n\r\n  [82] _Torfaeus._ Loc. cit.\r\n\r\n  [83] According to another account, 960.

In Erfurt, after the church-yards were filled, 12,000\r\ncorpses were thrown into eleven great pits; and the like might, more\r\nor less exactly, be stated with respect to all the larger cities.[86]\r\nFuneral ceremonies, the last consolation of the survivors, were every\r\nwhere impracticable.\r\n\r\n  [85] _Auger. de Biterris_ in _Muratori_.

Smaller losses were sufficient to cause those\r\nconvulsions, whose consequences were felt for some centuries, in a\r\nfalse impulse given to civil life, and whose indirect influence,\r\nunknown to the English, has, perhaps, extended even to modern times.\r\n\r\n  [92] _Barnes_, p. 436.\r\n\r\n  [93] _Wood_, Loc. cit.\r\n\r\nMorals were deteriorated every where, and the service of God was, in\r\na great measure, laid aside; for, in many places, the churches were\r\ndeserted, being bereft of their priests. The instruction of the people\r\nwas impeded;[94] covetousness became general; and when tranquility\r\nwas restored, the great increase of lawyers was astonishing, to whom\r\nthe endless disputes regarding inheritances, offered a rich harvest.\r\nThe want of priests too, throughout the country, operated very\r\ndetrimentally upon the people (the lower classes being most exposed\r\nto the ravages of the plague, whilst the houses of the nobility\r\nwere, in proportion, much more spared) and it was no compensation\r\nthat whole bands of ignorant laymen, who had lost their wives during\r\nthe pestilence, crowded into the monastic orders, that they might\r\nparticipate in the respectability of the priesthood, and in the rich\r\nheritages which fell in to the church from all quarters. The sittings\r\nof Parliament, of the King’s Bench, and of most of the other courts,\r\nwere suspended as long as the malady raged. The laws of peace availed\r\nnot during the dominion of death. Pope Clement took advantage of this\r\nstate of disorder, to adjust the bloody quarrel between Edward III.\r\nand Philip VI.; yet he only succeeded during the period that the\r\nplague commanded peace. Philip’s death (1350) annulled all treaties;\r\nand it is related, that Edward, with other troops indeed, but with\r\nthe same leaders and knights, again took the field. Ireland was much\r\nless heavily visited than England. The disease seems to have scarcely\r\nreached the mountainous districts of that kingdom; and Scotland\r\ntoo would, perhaps, have remained free, had not the Scots availed\r\nthemselves of the discomfiture of the English, to make an irruption\r\ninto their territory, which terminated in the destruction of their\r\narmy, by the plague and by the sword, and the extension of the\r\npestilence, through those who escaped, over the whole country.\r\n\r\n  [94] _Wood_ says, that before the plague, there were 13,000 students\r\n  at Oxford; a number, which may, in some degree, enable us to form an\r\n  estimate of the state of education in England at that time, if we\r\n  consider that the universities were, in the middle ages, frequented\r\n  by younger students, who in modern times do not quit school till\r\n  their 18th year.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement, there was in England a superabundance of all\r\nthe necessaries of life; but the plague, which seemed then to be the\r\nsole disease, was soon accompanied by a fatal murrain among cattle.\r\nWandering about without herdsmen, they fell by thousands; and, as\r\nhas likewise been observed in Africa, the birds and beasts of prey\r\nare said not to have touched them. Of what nature this murrain may\r\nhave been, can no more be determined, than whether it originated from\r\ncommunication with plague patients, or from other causes; but thus much\r\nis certain, that it did not break out until after the commencement of\r\nthe Black Death. In consequence of this murrain, and the impossibility\r\nof removing the corn from the fields, there was every where a great\r\nrise in the price of food, which to many was inexplicable, because the\r\nharvest had been plentiful; by others it was attributed to the wicked\r\ndesigns of the labourers and dealers; but it had its foundation in\r\nthe actual deficiency, arising from circumstances by which individual\r\nclasses at all times endeavour to profit. For a whole year, until\r\nit terminated in August, 1349, the Black Plague prevailed in this\r\nbeautiful island, and every where poisoned the springs of comfort and\r\nprosperity.[95]\r\n\r\n  [95] _Barnes_ and _Wood_. Loc. cit.\r\n\r\nIn other countries, it generally lasted only half a year, but returned\r\nfrequently in individual places; on which account, some, without\r\nsufficient proof, assigned to it a period of seven years.[96]\r\n\r\n  [96] _Gobelin Person_, in _Meibom_. Loc. cit.\r\n\r\nSpain was uninteruptedly ravaged by the Black Plague till after the\r\nyear 1350, to which the frequent internal feuds and the wars with the\r\nMoors not a little contributed. Alphonso XI., whose passion for war\r\ncarried him too far, died of it at the siege of Gibraltar, on the 26th\r\nof March, 1350. He was the only king in Europe who fell a sacrifice to\r\nit; but even before this period, inumerable families had been thrown\r\ninto affliction.[97] The mortality seems otherwise to have been smaller\r\nin Spain than in Italy, and about as considerable as in France.\r\n\r\n  [97] _Juan de Mariana._ Historia General de España.

The plagues, which in the sequel often returned until\r\nthe year 1383,[98] we do not consider as belonging to “the Great\r\nMortality.” They were rather common pestilences, without inflammation\r\nof the lungs, such as in former times, and in the following centuries,\r\nwere excited by the matter of contagion everywhere existing, and which,\r\non every favorable occasion, gained ground anew, as is usually the case\r\nwith this frightful disease.\r\n\r\n  [98] _Gobelin Person._ Loc. cit. _V. Chalin_, p. 53.\r\n\r\nThe concourse of large bodies of people was especially dangerous; and\r\nthus, the premature celebration of the Jubilee, to which Clement VI.\r\ncited the faithful to Rome, (1350), during the great epidemic, caused a\r\nnew eruption of the plague, from which it is said, that scarcely one in\r\nan hundred of the pilgrims escaped.[99]\r\n\r\n  [99] _Guillelm de Nangis._ Loc. cit.\r\n\r\nItaly was, in consequence, depopulated anew; and those who returned,\r\nspread poison and corruption of morals in all directions.[100] It is,\r\ntherefore, the less apparent, how that Pope, who was in general so\r\nwise and considerate, and who knew how to pursue the path of reason and\r\nhumanity, under the most difficult circumstances, should have been led\r\nto adopt a measure so injurious; since he, himself, was so convinced of\r\nthe salutary effect of seclusion, that during the plague in Avignon, he\r\nkept up constant fires, and suffered no one to approach him;[101] and,\r\nin other respects, gave such orders as averted, or alleviated, much\r\nmisery.\r\n\r\n  [100] _Spangenberg._ fol. 337. b.

In Sweden,\r\ntwo princes died--Häken and Knut, half-brothers of King Magnus; and\r\nin Westgothland alone, 466 priests.[102] The inhabitants of Iceland\r\nand Greenland, found in the coldness of their inhospitable climate, no\r\nprotection against the southern enemy who had penetrated to them from\r\nhappier countries. The plague caused great havoc among them. Nature\r\nmade no allowance for their constant warfare with the elements, and\r\nthe parsimony with which she had meted out to them the enjoyments of\r\nlife.[103] In Denmark and Norway, however, people were so occupied with\r\ntheir own misery, that the accustomed voyages to Greenland ceased.\r\nTowering ice-bergs formed at the same time on the coast of East\r\nGreenland, in consequence of the general concussion of the earth’s\r\norganism; and no mortal, from that time forward, has ever seen that\r\nshore or its inhabitants.[104]\r\n\r\n  [102] _Dalin’s_ Svea Rikes Historie, Vol. II. c. xii. p. 496.\r\n\r\n  [103] _Saabye._ Tagebuch in Grönland.

In this country also, the mortality was\r\nextraordinarily great; and the same scenes of affliction and despair\r\nwere exhibited, as had occurred in those nations which had already\r\npassed the ordeal. The same mode of burial--the same horrible certainty\r\nof death--the same torpor and depression of spirits. The wealthy\r\nabandoned their treasures, and gave their villages and estates to the\r\nchurches and monasteries; this being, according to the notions of the\r\nage, the surest way of securing the favor of Heaven and the forgiveness\r\nof past sins. In Russia too, the voice of nature was silenced by fear\r\nand horror. In the hour of danger, fathers and mothers deserted their\r\nchildren, and children their parents.[105]\r\n\r\n  [105] _Richter_, Loc. cit.\r\n\r\nOf all the estimates of the number of lives lost in Europe, the most\r\nprobable is, that altogether, a fourth part of the inhabitants were\r\ncarried off. Now, if Europe at present contain 210,000,000 inhabitants,\r\nthe population, not to take a higher estimate, which might easily be\r\njustified, amounted to at least 105,000,000, in the 16th century.\r\n\r\nIt may, therefore, be assumed, without exaggeration, that Europe lost\r\nduring the Black Death, 25,000,000 of inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThat her nations could so quickly overcome such a fearful concussion\r\nin their external circumstances, and, in general, without retrogading\r\nmore than they actually did, could so develope their energies in the\r\nfollowing century, is a most convincing proof of the indestructibility\r\nof human society as a whole. To assume, however, that it did not\r\nsuffer any essential change internally, because in appearance every\r\nthing remained as before, is inconsistent with a just view of cause\r\nand effect. Many historians seem to have adopted such an opinion;\r\naccustomed, as usual, to judge of the moral condition of the people\r\nsolely according to the vicissitudes of earthly power, the events\r\nof battles, and the influence of religion, but to pass over with\r\nindifference, the great phenomena of nature, which modify, not only the\r\nsurface of the earth, but also the human mind. Hence, most of them have\r\ntouched but superficially on the “great mortality” of the 14th century.\r\nWe, for our parts are convinced, that in the history of the world, the\r\nBlack Death is one of the most important events which have prepared the\r\nway for the present state of Europe.\r\n\r\nHe who studies the human mind with attention, and forms a deliberate\r\njudgment on the intellectual powers which set people and states in\r\nmotion, may, perhaps, find some proofs of this assertion in the\r\nfollowing observations:--at that time, the advancement of the hierarchy\r\nwas, in most countries, extraordinary; for the church acquired\r\ntreasures and large properties in land, even to a greater extent than\r\nafter the crusades; but experience has demonstrated, that such a state\r\nof things is ruinous to the people, and causes them to retrograde, as\r\nwas evinced on this occasion.\r\n\r\nAfter the cessation of the Black Plague, a greater fertility in\r\nwomen was everywhere remarkable--a grand phenomenon, which, from its\r\noccurrence after every destructive pestilence, proves to conviction,\r\nif any occurrence can do so, the prevalence of a higher power in the\r\ndirection of general organic life. Marriages were, almost without\r\nexception, prolific; and double and treble births were more frequent\r\nthan at other times; under which head, we should remember the strange\r\nremark, that after the “great mortality” the children were said to have\r\ngot fewer teeth than before; at which, contemporaries were mightily\r\nshocked, and even later writers have felt surprise.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the grounds of this oft-repeated assertion, we shall\r\nfind that they were astonished, to see children cut twenty, or at\r\nmost, twenty-two teeth, under the supposition that a greater number had\r\nformerly fallen to their share.[106] Some writers of authority, as,\r\nfor example, the physician Savonarola,[107] at Ferrara, who probably\r\nlooked for twenty-eight teeth in children, published their opinions on\r\nthis subject. Others copied from them, without seeing for themselves,\r\nas often happens in other matters which are equally evident; and thus\r\nthe world believed in the miracle of an imperfection in the human body\r\nwhich had been caused by the Black Plague.\r\n\r\n  [106] We may take this view of the subject from _Guillelm de Nangis_\r\n  and _Barnes_, if we read them _with attention_. _Olof Dalin_, Loc.\r\n  cit.\r\n\r\n  [107] Practica de aegritudinibus a capite usque ad pedes, Papiae,\r\n  1486, fol. Tract, VI. c. vii.\r\n\r\nThe people gradually consoled themselves after the sufferings which\r\nthey had undergone; the dead were lamented and forgotten; and in\r\nthe stirring vicissitudes of existence, the world belonged to the\r\nliving.[108]\r\n\r\n  [108] “Darnach, da das Sterben, die Geiselfarth, Römerfarth,\r\n  Judenschlacht, als vorgeschrieben steht, ein End hatte, da hub die\r\n  Welt wieder an zu leben und fröhlich zu seyn, und machten die Männer\r\n  neue Kleidung.” Limburg Chronik, p. 26. After this when, as was\r\n  stated before, the mortality, the processions of the Flagellants, the\r\n  expeditions to Rome, and the massacre of the Jews, were at an end,\r\n  the world begun to revive and be joyful, and the people put on new\r\n  clothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMORAL EFFECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mental shock sustained by all nations during the prevalence of the\r\nBlack Plague, is without parallel and beyond description. In the eyes\r\nof the timorous, danger was the certain harbinger of death; many fell\r\nvictims to fear, on the first appearance of the distemper,[109] and\r\nthe most stout hearted lost their confidence. Thus, after reliance on\r\nthe future had died away, the spiritual union which binds man to his\r\nfamily and his fellow creatures, was gradually dissolved. The pious\r\nclosed their accounts with the world,--eternity presented itself to\r\ntheir view,--their only remaining desire, was for a participation in\r\nthe consolations of religion, because to them death was disarmed of its\r\nsting.\r\n\r\n  [109] _Chalin_, Loc. cit. p. 92. _Detmar’s_ Lübeck Chronicle, T. I.\r\n  p. 401.\r\n\r\nRepentance seized the transgressor, admonishing him to consecrate his\r\nremaining hours to the exercise of Christian virtues. All minds were\r\ndirected to the contemplation of futurity; and children, who manifest\r\nthe more elevated feelings of the soul without alloy, were frequently\r\nseen, while labouring under the plague, breathing out their spirit with\r\nprayer and songs of thanksgiving.[110]\r\n\r\n  [110] Chronic. _Ditmari_, Episcop. Mersepurg, Francof. 1580, fol.\r\n  p. 358.----“_Spangenberg_, p. 338. The lamentation was pitiful;\r\n  and the only remaining solace, was the prevalent anxiety, inspired\r\n  by the danger, to prepare for a glorious departure; no other hope\r\n  remained--death appeared inevitable. Many were hence induced to\r\n  search into their own hearts, to turn to God, and to abandon their\r\n  wicked courses: parents warned their children, and instructed them\r\n  how to pray, and to submit to the ways of Providence: neighbours\r\n  mutually admonished each other; none could reckon on a single hour’s\r\n  respite. Many persons, and even young children, were seen bidding\r\n  farewell to the world; some with prayer, others with praises on their\r\n  lips.”\r\n\r\nAn awful sense of contrition seized Christians of every communion; they\r\nresolved to forsake their vices--to make restitution for past offences,\r\nbefore they were summoned hence--to seek reconciliation with their\r\nMaker, and to avert, by self-chastisement, the punishment due to their\r\nformer sins. Human nature would be exalted, could the countless noble\r\nactions, which, in times of most imminent danger, were performed in\r\nsecret, be recorded for the instruction of future generations. They,\r\nhowever, have no influence on the course of worldly events. They are\r\nknown only to silent eye-witnesses, and soon fall into oblivion. But\r\nhypocrisy, illusion and bigotry, stalk abroad undaunted; they desecrate\r\nwhat is noble--they pervert what is divine, to the unholy purposes\r\nof selfishness; which hurries along every good feeling in the false\r\nexcitement of the age. Thus it was in the years of this plague. In the\r\n14th century, the monastic system was still in its full vigour,--the\r\npower of the ecclesiastical orders and brotherhoods, was revered by the\r\npeople, and the hierarchy was still formidable to the temporal power.\r\nIt was, therefore, in the natural constitution of society that bigotted\r\nzeal, which in such times makes a shew of public acts of penance,\r\nshould avail itself of the semblance of religion. But this took place\r\nin such a manner, that unbridled, self-willed penitence, degenerated\r\ninto luke-warmness, renounced obedience to the hierarchy, and prepared\r\na fearful opposition to the church, paralysed by antiquated forms.\r\n\r\nWhile all countries were filled with lamentations and woe, there\r\nfirst arose in Hungary,[111] and afterwards in Germany, the\r\nBrotherhood of the Flagellants, called also the Brethren of the\r\nCross, or Cross-bearers, who took upon themselves the repentance of\r\nthe people, for the sins they had committed, and offered prayers and\r\nsupplications for the averting of this plague. This Order consisted\r\nchiefly of persons of the lower class, who were either actuated by\r\nsincere contrition, or, who joyfully availed themselves of this pretext\r\nfor idleness, and were hurried along with the tide of distracting\r\nfrenzy. But, as these brotherhoods gained in repute, and were\r\nwelcomed by the people with veneration and enthusiasm, many nobles\r\nand ecclesiastics ranged themselves under their standard; and their\r\nbands were not unfrequently augmented by children, honourable women\r\nand nuns; so powerfully were minds of the most opposite temperaments\r\nenslaved by this infatuation.[112] They marched through the cities,\r\nin well-organized processions, with leaders and singers; their heads\r\ncovered as far as the eyes; their look fixed on the ground, accompanied\r\nby every token of the deepest contrition and mourning. They were\r\nrobed in sombre garments, with red crosses on the breast, back, and\r\ncap, and bore triple scourges, tied in three or four knots, in which\r\npoints of iron were fixed. Tapers and magnificent banners of velvet\r\nand cloth of gold, were carried before them; wherever they made\r\ntheir appearance, they were welcomed by the ringing of the bells; and\r\nthe people flocked from all quarters, to listen to their hymns and\r\nto witness their penance, with devotion and tears. In the year 1349,\r\ntwo hundred Flagellants first entered Strasburg, where they were\r\nreceived with great joy, and hospitably lodged by the citizens. Above\r\na thousand joined the brotherhood, which now assumed the appearance of\r\na wandering tribe, and separated into two bodies, for the purpose of\r\njourneying to the north and to the south. For more than half a year,\r\nnew parties arrived weekly; and, on each arrival, adults and children\r\nleft their families to accompany them; till, at length, their sanctity\r\nwas questioned, and the doors of houses and churches were closed\r\nagainst them.[113] At Spires, two hundred boys, of twelve years of age\r\nand under, constituted themselves into a Brotherhood of the Cross,\r\nin imitation of the children, who, about a hundred years before, had\r\nunited, at the instigation of some fanatic monks, for the purpose of\r\nrecovering the Holy Sepulchre. All the inhabitants of this town, were\r\ncarried away by the illusion; they conducted the strangers to their\r\nhouses with songs of thanksgiving, to regale them for the night. The\r\nwomen embroidered banners for them, and all were anxious to augment\r\ntheir pomp; and at every succeeding pilgrimage, their influence and\r\nreputation increased.[114] It was not merely some individual parts of\r\nthe country that fostered them: all Germany, Hungary, Poland, Bohemia,\r\nSilesia, and Flanders, did homage to the mania; and they at length\r\nbecame as formidable to the secular, as they were to the ecclesiastical\r\npower. The influence of this fanaticism, was great and threatening;\r\nresembling the excitement which called all the inhabitants of Europe\r\ninto the deserts of Syria and Palestine, about two hundred and fifty\r\nyears before. The appearance, in itself, was not novel. As far back\r\nas the 11th century, many believers, in Asia and Southern Europe,\r\nafflicted themselves with the punishment of flagellation. Dominicus\r\nLoricatus, a monk of St. Croce d’Avellano, is mentioned as the master\r\nand model of this species of mortification of the flesh; which,\r\naccording to the primitive notions of the Asiatic Anchorites, was\r\ndeemed eminently Christian. The author of the solemn processions of the\r\nFlagellants, is said to have been St. Anthony; for even in his time\r\n(1231), this kind of penance was so much in vogue, that it is recorded\r\nas an eventful circumstance in the history of the world. In 1260, the\r\nFlagellants appeared in Italy as _Devoti_. “When the land was polluted\r\nby vices and crimes,[115] an unexampled spirit of remorse suddenly\r\nseized the minds of the Italians. The fear of Christ fell upon all:\r\nnoble and ignoble, old and young, and even children of five years of\r\nage, marched through the streets with no covering but a scarf round\r\nthe waist. They each carried a scourge of leathern thongs, which they\r\napplied to their limbs, amid sighs and tears, with such violence,\r\nthat the blood flowed from the wounds. Not only during the day, but\r\neven by night, and in the severest winter, they traversed the cities\r\nwith burning torches and banners, in thousands and tens of thousands,\r\nheaded by their priests, and prostrated themselves before the altars.\r\nThey proceeded in the same manner in the villages; and the woods and\r\nmountains resounded with the voices of those whose cries were raised to\r\nGod. The melancholy chaunt of the penitent alone, was heard. Enemies\r\nwere reconciled; men and women vied with each other in splendid\r\nworks of charity, as if they dreaded, that Divine Omnipotence would\r\npronounce on them the doom of annihilation.”\r\n\r\n  [111] _Torfaei_ Hist. rer.

Regnier, a hermit of Perugia, is recorded as a fanatic\r\npreacher of penitence, with whom the extravagance originated.[116]\r\nIn the year 1296, there was a great procession of the Flagellants in\r\nStrasburg;[117] and in 1334, fourteen years before the great mortality,\r\nthe sermon of Venturinus, a Dominican friar, of Bergamo, induced above\r\n10,000 persons to undertake a new pilgrimage. They scourged themselves\r\nin the churches, and were entertained in the market-places, at the\r\npublic expense. At Rome, Venturinus was derided, and banished by the\r\nPope to the mountains of Ricondona. He patiently endured all--went to\r\nthe Holy Land, and died at Smyrna, 1346.[118] Hence we see that this\r\nfanaticism was a mania of the middle ages, which, in the year 1349,\r\non so fearful an occasion, and while still so fresh in remembrance,\r\nneeded no new founder; of whom, indeed, all the records are silent.\r\nIt probably arose in many places at the same time; for the terror of\r\ndeath, which pervaded all nations and suddenly set such powerful\r\nimpulses in motion, might easily conjure up the fanaticism of\r\nexaggerated and overpowering repentance.\r\n\r\n  [116] _Schnurrer_, Chronicle of the Plagues, T. I. p. 291.\r\n\r\n  [117] Königshoven. Loc. cit.\r\n\r\n  [118] _Förstemann_, Loc. cit. The pilgrimages of the Flagellants of\r\n  the year 1349, were not the last. Later in the 14th century, this\r\n  fanaticism still manifested itself several times, though never to so\r\n  great an extent: in the 15th century, it was deemed necessary, in\r\n  several parts of Germany, to extirpate them by fire and sword;--and\r\n  in the year 1710, processions of the Cross-bearers were still seen\r\n  in Italy. How deep this mania had taken root, is proved by the\r\n  deposition of a citizen of Nordhäusen (1446): that his wife, in the\r\n  belief of performing a Christian act, wanted to scourge her children,\r\n  as soon as they were baptized.\r\n\r\nThe manner and proceedings of the Flagellants of the 13th and 14th\r\ncenturies, exactly resemble each other. But, if during the Black\r\nPlague, simple credulity came to their aid, which seized, as a\r\nconsolation, the grossest delusion of religious enthusiasm, yet it is\r\nevident that the leaders must have been intimately united, and have\r\nexercised the power of a secret association. Besides, the rude band\r\nwas generally under the controul of men of learning, some of whom at\r\nleast, certainly had other objects in view, independent of those which\r\nostensibly appeared. Whoever was desirous of joining the brotherhood,\r\nwas bound to remain in it thirty-four days, and to have four-pence per\r\nday at his own disposal, so that he might not be burthensome to any\r\none; if married, he was obliged to have the sanction of his wife, and\r\ngive the assurance that he was reconciled to all men. The Brothers\r\nof the Cross, were not permitted to seek for free quarters, or even\r\nto enter a house without having been invited; they were forbidden to\r\nconverse with females; and if they transgressed these rules, or acted\r\nwithout precaution, they were obliged to confess to the Superior, who\r\nsentenced them to several lashes of the scourge, by way of penance.\r\nEcclesiastics had not, as such, any pre-eminence among them; according\r\nto their original law, which, however, was often transgressed, they\r\ncould not become Masters, or take part in the _Secret Councils_.\r\nPenance was performed twice every day: in the morning and evening, they\r\nwent abroad in pairs, singing psalms, amid the ringing of the bells;\r\nand when they arrived at the place of flagellation, they stripped the\r\nupper part of their bodies and put off their shoes, keeping on only a\r\nlinen dress, reaching from the waist to the ancles. They then lay down\r\nin a large circle, in different positions, according to the nature of\r\ntheir crime: the adulterer with his face to the ground; the perjurer\r\non one side, holding up three of his fingers, &c., and were then\r\ncastigated, some more and some less, by the Master, who ordered them to\r\nrise in the words of a prescribed form.[119] Upon this, they scourged\r\nthemselves, amid the singing of psalms and loud supplications for\r\nthe averting of the plague, with genuflexions, and other ceremonies,\r\nof which contemporary writers give various accounts; and at the same\r\ntime constantly boasted of their penance, that the blood of their\r\nwounds was mingled with that of the Saviour.[120] One of them, in\r\nconclusion, stood up to read a letter, which it was pretended an angel\r\nhad brought from heaven, to St. Peter’s church, at Jerusalem, stating\r\nthat Christ, who was sore displeased at the sins of man, had granted at\r\nthe intercession of the Holy Virgin and of the angels, that all who\r\nshould wander about for thirty-four days and scourge themselves, should\r\nbe partakers of the Divine grace.[121] This scene caused as great a\r\ncommotion among the believers as the finding of the holy spear once did\r\nat Antioch; and if any among the clergy enquired who had sealed the\r\nletter? he was boldly answered, the same who had sealed the Gospel!\r\n\r\n  [119] _Königshoven_, p. 298:\r\n\r\n    “_Stant uf durch der reinen Martel ere;\r\n    Und hüte dich vor der Sünden mere._”\r\n\r\n  [120] _Guill. de Nang._ Loc. cit.\r\n\r\n  [121] _Albert Argentinens._ Loc. cit.\r\n\r\nAll this had so powerful an effect, that the church was in considerable\r\ndanger; for the Flagellants gained more credit than the priests, from\r\nwhom they so entirely withdrew themselves, that they even absolved\r\neach other. Besides, they everywhere took possession of the churches,\r\nand their new songs, which went from mouth to mouth, operated strongly\r\non the minds of the people. Great enthusiasm and originally pious\r\nfeelings, are clearly distinguishable in these hymns, and especially\r\nin the chief psalm of the Cross-bearers, which is still extant, and\r\nwhich was sung all over Germany, in different dialects, and is probably\r\nof a more ancient date.[122] Degeneracy, however, soon crept in; crimes\r\nwere everywhere committed; and there was no energetic man capable\r\nof directing the individual excitement to purer objects, even had an\r\neffectual resistance to the tottering church been at that early period\r\nseasonable, and had it been possible to restrain the fanaticism.\r\nThe Flagellants sometimes undertook to make trial of their power of\r\nworking miracles; as in Strasburg, where they attempted, in their own\r\ncircle, to resuscitate a dead child: they however failed, and their\r\nunskilfulness did them much harm, though they succeeded here and there\r\nin maintaining some confidence in their holy calling, by pretending to\r\nhave the power of casting out evil spirits.[123]\r\n\r\n  [122] We meet with fragments of different lengths in the Chronicles\r\n  of the times, but the only entire MS. which we possess, is in the\r\n  valuable Library of President von Meusebach.

Already, in the\r\nsame year, the general indignation set bounds to their intrigues;\r\nso that the strict measures adopted by the Emperor Charles IV. and\r\nPope Clement,[124] who, throughout the whole of this fearful period,\r\nmanifested prudence and noble-mindedness, and conducted himself in\r\na manner every way worthy of his high station, were easily put into\r\nexecution.[125]\r\n\r\n  [124] He issued a bull against them, Oct. 20, 1349. _Raynald._\r\n  _Trithem._ Loc. cit.\r\n\r\n  [125] But as they at last ceased to excite astonishment, were no\r\n  longer welcomed by the ringing of bells, and were not received with\r\n  veneration, as before, they vanished as human imaginations are wont\r\n  to do.

Wittenberg, 1596, fol.\r\n  p. 340–341.\r\n\r\nThe Sorbonne, at Paris, and the Emperor Charles, had already applied\r\nto the Holy See, for assistance against these formidable and heretical\r\nexcesses, which had well nigh destroyed the influence of the clergy in\r\nevery place; when a hundred of the Brotherhood of the Cross arrived\r\nat Avignon from Basle, and desired admission. The Pope, regardless\r\nof the intercession of several cardinals, interdicted their public\r\npenance, which he had not authorized; and, on pain of excommunication,\r\nprohibited throughout Christendom the continuance of these\r\npilgrimages.[126] Philip VI., supported by the condemnatory judgment\r\nof the Sorbonne, forbid their reception in France.[127] Manfred, King\r\nof Sicily, at the same time threatened them with punishment by death:\r\nand in the East, they were withstood by several bishops, among whom was\r\nJanussius, of Gnesen,[128] and Preczlaw, of Breslaw, who condemned to\r\ndeath one of their Masters, formerly a deacon; and, in conformity with\r\nthe barbarity of the times, had him publicly burnt.[129] In Westphalia,\r\nwhere so shortly before, they had venerated the Brothers of the Cross,\r\nthey now persecuted them with relentless severity;[130] and in the\r\nMark, as well as in all the other countries of Germany, they pursued\r\nthem, as if they had been the authors of every misfortune.[131]\r\n\r\n  [126] _Albert Argentinens._ Loc. cit.\r\n\r\n  [127] _Guillelm de Nangis._\r\n\r\n  [128] _Ditmar._ Loc. cit.\r\n\r\n  [129] _Klose_ of _Breslaw’s_ Documental History and Description, 8vo.\r\n  Vol. II. p. 190.

In every destructive pestilence,\r\nthe common people at first attribute the mortality to poison. No\r\ninstruction avails; the supposed testimony of their eyesight, is to\r\nthem a proof, and they authoritatively demand the victims of their\r\nrage. On whom then was it so likely to fall, as on the Jews, the\r\nusurers and the strangers who lived at enmity with the Christians? They\r\nwere everywhere suspected of having poisoned the wells or infected the\r\nair.[132] They alone were considered as having brought this fearful\r\nmortality among the Christians.[133] They were, in consequence,\r\npursued with merciless cruelty; and either indiscriminately given up\r\nto the fury of the populace, or sentenced by sanguinary tribunals,\r\nwhich, with all the forms of law, ordered them to be burnt alive. In\r\ntimes like these, much is indeed said of guilt and innocence; but\r\nhatred and revenge bear down all discrimination, and the smallest\r\nprobability, magnifies suspicion into certainty. These bloody scenes,\r\nwhich disgraced Europe in the 14th century, are a counterpart to a\r\nsimilar mania of the age, which was manifested in the persecutions of\r\nwitches and sorcerers; and, like these, they prove, that enthusiasm,\r\nassociated with hatred, and leagued with the baser passions, may work\r\nmore powerfully upon whole nations, than religion and legal order; nay,\r\nthat it even knows how to profit by the authority of both, in order the\r\nmore surely to satiate with blood, the sword of long suppressed revenge.\r\n\r\n  [132] So says the Polish historian _Dlugoss_, Loc. cit., while most\r\n  of his contemporaries, mention only the poisoning of the wells. It is\r\n  evident, that in the state of their feelings, it mattered little to\r\n  them to add another still more formidable accusation.\r\n\r\n  [133] In those places where no Jews resided, as in Leipsig,\r\n  Magdeburg, Brieg, Frankenstein, &c. the grave-diggers were accused\r\n  of the crime.--V. _Möhsen’s_ History of the Sciences in the March of\r\n  Brandenburg, T. II. p. 265.\r\n\r\nThe persecution of the Jews, commenced in September and October,\r\n1348,[134] at Chillon, on the Lake of Geneva, where the first criminal\r\nproceedings were instituted against them, after they had long before\r\nbeen accused by the people of poisoning the wells; similar scenes\r\nfollowed in Bern and Freyburg, in January, 1349. Under the influence of\r\nexcruciating suffering, the tortured Jews confessed themselves guilty\r\nof the crime imputed to them; and it being affirmed that poison had in\r\nfact been found in a well at Zoffingen, this was deemed a sufficient\r\nproof to convince the world; and the persecution of the abhorred\r\nculprits, thus appeared justifiable. Now, though we can take as little\r\nexception at these proceedings, as at the multifarious confessions of\r\nwitches, because the interrogatories of the fanatic and sanguinary\r\ntribunals, were so complicated, that by means of the rack, the required\r\nanswer must inevitably be obtained; and it is besides conformable\r\nto human nature, that crimes which are in every body’s mouth, may,\r\nin the end, be actually committed by some, either from wantonness,\r\nrevenge, or desperate exasperation: yet crimes and accusations, are,\r\nunder circumstances like these, merely the offspring of a revengeful,\r\nfrenzied, spirit in the people; and the accusers, according to the\r\nfundamental principles of morality, which are the same in every age,\r\nare the more guilty transgressors.\r\n\r\n  [134] See the original proceedings, in the Appendix.\r\n\r\nAlready in the autumn of 1348, a dreadful panic, caused by the\r\nsupposed poisoning, seized all nations; and in Germany especially,\r\nthe springs and wells were built over, that nobody might drink of\r\nthem, or employ the water for culinary purposes; and for a long time,\r\nthe inhabitants of numerous towns and villages, used only river and\r\nrain water.[135] The city gates were also guarded with the greatest\r\ncaution,--only confidential persons were admitted; and if medicine,\r\nor any other article, which might be supposed to be poisonous, was\r\nfound in the possession of a stranger,--and it was natural that some\r\nshould have these things by them for their private use,--they were\r\nforced to swallow a portion of it.[136] By this trying state of\r\nprivation, distrust and suspicion, the hatred against the supposed\r\npoisoners, became greatly increased, and often broke out in popular\r\ncommotions, which only served still further to infuriate the wildest\r\npassions. The noble and the mean, fearlessly bound themselves by an\r\noath, to extirpate the Jews by fire and sword, and to snatch them from\r\ntheir protectors, of whom the number was so small, that throughout\r\nall Germany, but few places can be mentioned where these unfortunate\r\npeople were not regarded as outlaws--martyred and burnt.[137] Solemn\r\nsummonses were issued from Bern to the towns of Basle, Freyburg in\r\nthe Breisgau, and Strasburg, to pursue the Jews as poisoners. The\r\nBurgomasters and Senators, indeed, opposed this requisition; but in\r\nBasle the populace obliged them to bind themselves by an oath, to\r\nburn the Jews, and to forbid persons of that community from entering\r\ntheir city, for the space of two hundred years. Upon this, all the\r\nJews in Basle, whose number could not have been inconsiderable, were\r\nenclosed in a wooden building, constructed for the purpose, and burnt\r\ntogether with it, upon the mere outcry of the people, without sentence\r\nor trial, which indeed would have availed them nothing. Soon after,\r\nthe same thing took place at Freyburg. A regular Diet was held at\r\nBennefeld, in Alsace, where the bishops, lords and barons, as also\r\ndeputies of the counts (_query_ counties?) and towns, consulted how\r\nthey should proceed with regard to the Jews; and when the deputies of\r\nStrasburg--not indeed the bishop of this town, who proved himself a\r\nviolent fanatic--spoke in favor of the persecuted, as nothing criminal\r\nwas substantiated against them; a great outcry was raised, and it was\r\nvehemently asked, why, if so, they had covered their wells and removed\r\ntheir buckets? A sanguinary decree was resolved upon, of which the\r\npopulace, who obeyed the call of the nobles and superior clergy, became\r\nbut the too willing executioners.[138] Wherever the Jews were not\r\nburnt, they were at least banished; and so being compelled to wander\r\nabout, they fell into the hands of the country people, who without\r\nhumanity, and regardless of all laws, persecuted them with fire and\r\nsword. At Spires, the Jews, driven to despair, assembled in their own\r\nhabitations, which they set on fire, and thus consumed themselves\r\nwith their families. The few that remained, were forced to submit to\r\nbaptism; while the dead bodies of the murdered, which lay about the\r\nstreets, were put into empty wine casks, and rolled into the Rhine,\r\nlest they should infect the air. The mob was forbidden to enter the\r\nruins of the habitations that were burnt in the Jewish quarter; for the\r\nsenate itself caused search to be made for the treasure, which is said\r\nto have been very considerable. At Strasburg, two thousand Jews were\r\nburnt alive in their own burial ground, where a large scaffold had been\r\nerected: a few who promised to embrace Christianity, were spared, and\r\ntheir children taken from the pile. The youth and beauty of several\r\nfemales also excited some commiseration; and they were snatched from\r\ndeath against their will: many, however, who forcibly made their escape\r\nfrom the flames, were murdered in the streets.\r\n\r\n  [135] _Hermanni Gygantis_ Flores temporum, sive Chronicon\r\n  Universale--_Ed.

The Flagellants entered that place in August; the Jews, on\r\nthis occasion, fell out with the Christians, and killed several; but\r\nwhen they saw their inability to withstand the increasing superiority\r\nof their enemies, and that nothing could save them from destruction,\r\nthey consumed themselves and their families, by setting fire to their\r\ndwellings. Thus also, in other places, the entry of the Flagellants\r\ngave rise to scenes of slaughter; and as thirst for blood was\r\neverywhere combined with an unbridled spirit of proselytism, a fanatic\r\nzeal arose among the Jews, to perish as martyrs to their ancient\r\nreligion. And how was it possible, that they could from the heart\r\nembrace Christianity, when its precepts were never more outrageously\r\nviolated? At Eslingen, the whole Jewish community burned themselves\r\nin their synagogue;[142] and mothers were often seen throwing their\r\nchildren on the pile, to prevent their being baptised, and then\r\nprecipitating themselves into the flames.[143] In short, whatever\r\ndeeds, fanaticism, revenge, avarice and desperation, in fearful\r\ncombination, could instigate mankind to perform,--and where in such a\r\ncase is the limit?--were executed in the year 1349, throughout Germany,\r\nItaly and France, with impunity, and in the eyes of all the world.\r\nIt seemed as if the plague gave rise to scandalous acts and frantic\r\ntumults, not to mourning and grief: and the greater part of those who,\r\nby their education and rank, were called upon to raise the voice of\r\nreason, themselves led on the savage mob to murder and to plunder.\r\nAlmost all the Jews who saved their lives by baptism, were afterwards\r\nburnt at different times; for they continued to be accused of poisoning\r\nthe water and the air. Christians also, whom philanthropy or gain had\r\ninduced to offer them protection, were put on the rack and executed\r\nwith them.[144] Many Jews who had embraced Christianity, repented of\r\ntheir apostacy,--and, returning to their former faith, sealed it with\r\ntheir death.[145]\r\n\r\n  [142] _Spangenberg._ Loc. cit.\r\n\r\n  [143] _Guillelm. de Nangis._--_Dlugoss._ Loc. cit.\r\n\r\n  [144] _Albert. Argentinens._\r\n\r\n  [145] _Spangenberg_ describes a similar scene which took place at\r\n  Kostnitz.\r\n\r\nThe humanity and prudence of Clement VI., must, on this occasion, also\r\nbe mentioned to his honor; but even the highest ecclesiastical power\r\nwas insufficient to restrain the unbridled fury of the people. He\r\nnot only protected the Jews at Avignon, as far as lay in his power,\r\nbut also issued two bulls, in which he declared them innocent; and\r\nadmonished all Christians, though without success, to cease from\r\nsuch groundless persecutions.[146] The Emperor Charles IV. was also\r\nfavourable to them, and sought to avert their destruction, wherever\r\nhe could; but he dared not draw the sword of justice, and even found\r\nhimself obliged to yield to the selfishness of the Bohemian nobles,\r\nwho were unwilling to forego so favorable an opportunity of releasing\r\nthemselves from their Jewish creditors, under favor of an imperial\r\nmandate.[147] Duke Albert of Austria burned and pillaged those of his\r\ncities, which had persecuted the Jews,--a vain and inhuman proceeding,\r\nwhich, moreover, is not exempt from the suspicion of covetousness; yet\r\nhe was unable, in his own fortress of Kyberg, to protect some hundreds\r\nof Jews, who had been received there, from being barbarously burnt by\r\nthe inhabitants.[148] Several other princes and counts, among whom\r\nwas Ruprecht von der Pfalz, took the Jews under their protection, on\r\nthe payment of large sums: in consequence of which they were called\r\n“Jew-masters,” and were in danger of being attacked by the populace\r\nand by their powerful neighbours.[149] These persecuted and ill-used\r\npeople, except indeed where humane individuals took compassion on them\r\nat their own peril, or when they could command riches to purchase\r\nprotection, had no place of refuge left but the distant country of\r\nLithuania, where Boleslav V., Duke of Poland (1227–1279), had before\r\ngranted them liberty of conscience; and King Casimir the Great\r\n(1333–1370), yielding to the entreaties of Esther, a favourite Jewess,\r\nreceived them, and granted them further protection:[150] on which\r\naccount, that country is still inhabited by a great number of Jews,\r\nwho by their secluded habits, have, more than any people in Europe,\r\nretained the manners of the middle ages.\r\n\r\n  [146] _Guillelm de Nang._--_Raynald._\r\n\r\n  [147] Histor.

Unhappily, after the confessions of the first\r\nvictims in Switzerland, the rack extorted similar ones in various\r\nplaces. Some even acknowledged having received poisonous powder in\r\nbags, and injunctions from Toledo, by secret messengers. Bags of\r\nthis description, were also often found in wells, though it was not\r\nunfrequently discovered that the Christians themselves had thrown them\r\nin; probably to give occasion to murder and pillage; similar instances\r\nof which may be found in the persecutions of the witches.[153]\r\n\r\n  [151] _Albert Argentinens._\r\n\r\n  [152] _Hermann.

The most important are, the criminal\r\n  examinations of ten Jews, at Chillon, on the Lake of Geneva, held in\r\n  September and October, 1348.--V. Appendix. They produced the most\r\n  strange confessions, and sanctioned, by the false name of justice,\r\n  the blood-thirsty fanaticism which lighted the funeral piles. Copies\r\n  of these proceedings were sent to Bern and Strasburg, where they\r\n  gave rise to the first persecutions against the Jews.--V. also the\r\n  original Document of the offensive and defensive Alliance between\r\n  _Berthold von Götz_, Bishop of Strasburg, and many powerful lords and\r\n  nobles, in favor of the city of Strasburg, against Charles IV. The\r\n  latter saw himself compelled, in consequence, to grant to that city\r\n  an amnesty for the Jewish persecutions, which in our days would be\r\n  deemed disgraceful to an imperial crown. Not to mention many other\r\n  documents, which no less clearly shew the spirit of the 14th century,\r\n  p. 1021. f.\r\n\r\nThis picture needs no additions. A lively image of the Black Plague,\r\nand of the moral evil which followed in its train, will vividly\r\nrepresent itself to him who is acquainted with nature and the\r\nconstitution of society. Almost the only credible accounts of the\r\nmanner of living, and of the ruin which occurred in private life,\r\nduring this pestilence, are from Italy; and these may enable us to form\r\na just estimate of the general state of families in Europe, taking into\r\nconsideration what is peculiar in the manners of each country.\r\n\r\n“When the evil had become universal,” (speaking of Florence) “the\r\nhearts of all the inhabitants were closed to feelings of humanity.\r\nThey fled from the sick and all that belonged to them, hoping by these\r\nmeans to save themselves. Others shut themselves up in their houses,\r\nwith their wives, their children and households, living on the most\r\ncostly food, but carefully avoiding all excess. None were allowed\r\naccess to them; no intelligence of death or sickness was permitted\r\nto reach their ear; and they spent their time in singing and music,\r\nand other pastimes. Others, on the contrary, considered eating and\r\ndrinking to excess, amusements of all descriptions, the indulgence of\r\nevery gratification, and an indifference to what was passing around\r\nthem, as the best medicine, and acted accordingly. They wandered day\r\nand night, from one tavern to another, and feasted without moderation\r\nor bounds. In this way they endeavoured to avoid all contact with the\r\nsick, and abandoned their houses and property to chance, like men whose\r\ndeath-knell had already tolled.\r\n\r\nAmid this general lamentation and woe, the influence and authority\r\nof every law, human and divine, vanished. Most of those who were in\r\noffice, had been carried off by the plague, or lay sick, or had lost\r\nso many members of their families, that they were unable to attend\r\nto their duties; so that thenceforth every one acted as he thought\r\nproper. Others, in their mode of living, chose a middle course.\r\nThey ate and drank what they pleased, and walked abroad, carrying\r\nodoriferous flowers, herbs or spices, which they smelt to from time\r\nto time, in order to invigorate the brain, and to avert the baneful\r\ninfluence of the air, infected by the sick, and by the innumerable\r\ncorpses of those who had died of the plague. Others carried their\r\nprecaution still further, and thought the surest way to escape death\r\nwas by flight. They therefore left the city; women as well men\r\nabandoning their dwellings and their relations, and retiring into the\r\ncountry. But of these also, many were carried off, most of them alone\r\nand deserted by all the world, themselves having previously set the\r\nexample. Thus it was, that one citizen fled from another--a neighbour\r\nfrom his neighbours--a relation from his relations;--and in the end,\r\nso completely had terror extinguished every kindlier feeling, that\r\nthe brother forsook the brother--the sister the sister--the wife her\r\nhusband; and at last, even the parent his own offspring, and abandoned\r\nthem, unvisited and unsoothed, to their fate. Those, therefore, that\r\nstood in need of assistance fell a prey to greedy attendants; who\r\nfor an exorbitant recompence, merely handed the sick their food and\r\nmedicine, remained with them in their last moments, and then, not\r\nunfrequently, became themselves victims to their avarice and lived not\r\nto enjoy their extorted gain. Propriety and decorum were extinguished\r\namong the helpless sick. Females of rank seemed to forget their natural\r\nbashfulness, and committed the care of their persons, indiscriminately,\r\nto men and women of the lowest order. No longer were women, relatives\r\nor friends, found in the house of mourning, to share the grief of\r\nthe survivors--no longer was the corpse accompanied to the grave by\r\nneighbours and a numerous train of priests, carrying wax tapers and\r\nsinging psalms, nor was it borne along by other citizens of equal rank.\r\nMany breathed their last without a friend to sooth their dying pillow;\r\nand few indeed were they who departed amid the lamentations and tears\r\nof their friends and kindred. Instead of sorrow and mourning, appeared\r\nindifference, frivolity and mirth; this being considered, especially\r\nby the females, as conducive to health. Seldom was the body followed\r\nby even ten or twelve attendants; and instead of the usual bearers and\r\nsextons, mercenaries of the lowest of the populace undertook the office\r\nfor the sake of gain; and accompanied by only a few priests, and often\r\nwithout a single taper, it was borne to the very nearest church, and\r\nlowered into the first grave that was not already too full to receive\r\nit. Among the middling classes, and especially among the poor, the\r\nmisery was still greater. Poverty or negligence induced most of these\r\nto remain in their dwellings, or in the immediate neighbourhood; and\r\nthus they fell by thousands; and many ended their lives in the streets,\r\nby day and by night. The stench of putrefying corpses was often the\r\nfirst indication to their neighbours that more deaths had occurred. The\r\nsurvivors, to preserve themselves from infection, generally had the\r\nbodies taken out of the houses, and laid before the doors; where the\r\nearly morn found them in heaps, exposed to the affrighted gaze of the\r\npassing stranger. It was no longer possible to have a bier for every\r\ncorpse,--three or four were generally laid together--husband and wife,\r\nfather and mother, with two or three children, were frequently borne\r\nto the grave on the same bier; and it often happened that two priests\r\nwould accompany a coffin, bearing the cross before it, and be joined on\r\nthe way by several other funerals; so that instead of one, there were\r\nfive or six bodies for interment.”\r\n\r\nThus far Boccacio. On the conduct of the priests, another contemporary\r\nobserves:[154] “In large and small towns, they had withdrawn themselves\r\nthrough fear, leaving the performance of ecclesiastical duties to the\r\nfew who were found courageous and faithful enough to undertake them.”\r\nBut we ought not on that account to throw more blame on them than on\r\nothers; for we find proofs of the same timidity and heartlessness in\r\nevery class. During the prevalence of the Black Plague, the charitable\r\norders conducted themselves admirably, and did as much good as can be\r\ndone by individual bodies, in times of great misery and destruction;\r\nwhen compassion, courage, and the nobler feelings, are found but in\r\nthe few,--while cowardice, selfishness and ill-will, with the baser\r\npassions in their train--assert the supremacy. In place of virtue which\r\nhad been driven from the earth, wickedness everywhere reared her\r\nrebellious standard, and succeeding generations were consigned to the\r\ndominion of her baleful tyranny.\r\n\r\n  [154] _Guillelm de Nangis._ p. 110.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPHYSICIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we now turn to the medical talent which encountered the “Great\r\nMortality,” the middle ages must stand excused, since even the\r\nmoderns are of opinion that the art of medicine is not able to cope\r\nwith the Oriental plague, and can afford deliverance from it only\r\nunder particularly favorable circumstances.[155] We must bear in mind\r\nalso, that human science and art, appear particularly weak in great\r\npestilences, because they have to contend with the powers of nature, of\r\nwhich they have no knowledge; and which, if they had been, or could be\r\ncomprehended in their collective effects, would remain uncontrollable\r\nby them, principally on account of the disordered condition of human\r\nsociety. Moreover, every new plague has its peculiarities, which are\r\nthe less easily discovered on first view, because, during its ravages,\r\nfear and consternation humble the proud spirit.\r\n\r\n  [155] “Curationem omnem respuit pestis confirmata.”--_Chalin_, p. 33.\r\n\r\nThe physicians of the 14th century, during the Black Death, did what\r\nhuman intellect could do in the actual condition of the healing art;\r\nand their knowledge of the disease was by no means despicable. They,\r\nlike the rest of mankind, have indulged in prejudices, and defended\r\nthem, perhaps, with too much obstinacy: some of these, however, were\r\nfounded in the mode of thinking of the age, and passed current in those\r\ndays, as established truths: others continue to exist to the present\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nTheir successors in the 19th century, ought not therefore to vaunt\r\ntoo highly the pre-eminence of their knowledge, for they too will be\r\nsubjected to the severe judgment of posterity--they too, will, with\r\nreason, be accused of human weakness and want of foresight.\r\n\r\nThe medical faculty of Paris, the most celebrated of the 14th century,\r\nwere commissioned to deliver their opinion on the causes of the Black\r\nPlague, together with some appropriate regulations with regard to\r\nliving, during its prevalence. This document is sufficiently remarkable\r\nto find a place here.\r\n\r\n“We, the Members of the College of Physicians, of Paris, have, after\r\nmature consideration and consultation on the present mortality,\r\ncollected the advice of our old masters in the art, and intend to make\r\nknown the causes of this pestilence, more clearly than could be done\r\naccording to the rules and principles of astrology and natural science;\r\nwe, therefore, declare as follows:--\r\n\r\n“It is known that in India, and the vicinity of the Great Sea, the\r\nconstellations which combated the rays of the sun, and the warmth of\r\nthe heavenly fire, exerted their power especially against that sea, and\r\nstruggled violently with its waters. Hence, vapours often originate\r\nwhich envelope the sun, and convert his light into darkness. These\r\nvapours alternately rose and fell for twenty-eight days; but at last,\r\nsun and fire acted so powerfully upon the sea, that they attracted a\r\ngreat portion of it to themselves, and the waters of the ocean arose\r\nin the form of vapour; thereby the waters were in some parts, so\r\ncorrupted, that the fish which they contained, died. These corrupted\r\nwaters, however, the heat of the sun could not consume, neither could\r\nother wholesome water, hail or snow, and dew, originate therefrom. On\r\nthe contrary, this vapour spread itself through the air in many places\r\non the earth, and enveloped them in fog.\r\n\r\n“Such was the case all over Arabia, in a part of India; in Crete; in\r\nthe plains and valleys of Macedonia; in Hungary; Albania and Sicily.\r\nShould the same thing occur in Sardinia, not a man will be left alive;\r\nand the like will continue, so long as the sun remains in the sign\r\nof Leo, on all the islands and adjoining countries to which this\r\ncorrupted sea-wind extends, or has already extended from India. If the\r\ninhabitants of those parts do not employ and adhere to the following,\r\nor similar means and precepts, we announce to them inevitable\r\ndeath--except the grace of Christ preserve their lives.\r\n\r\n“We are of opinion, that the constellations, with the aid of Nature,\r\nstrive, by virtue of their divine might, to protect and heal the human\r\nrace; and to this end, in union with the rays of the sun, acting\r\nthrough the power of fire, endeavour to break through the mist.\r\nAccordingly, within the next ten days, and until the 17th of the\r\nensuing month of July, this mist will be converted into a stinking\r\ndeleterious rain, whereby the air will be much purified. Now, as soon\r\nas this rain announces itself, by thunder or hail, every one of you\r\nshould protect himself from the air; and, as well before as after the\r\nrain, kindle a large fire of vine-wood, green laurel, or other green\r\nwood; wormwood and chamomile should also be burnt in great quantity in\r\nthe market places, in other densely inhabited localities, and in the\r\nhouses. Until the earth is again completely dry, and for three days\r\nafterwards, no one ought to go abroad in the fields. During this time\r\nthe diet should be simple, and people should be cautious in avoiding\r\nexposure in the cool of the evening, at night, and in the morning.\r\nPoultry and water-fowl, young pork, old beef, and fat meat, in general,\r\nshould not be eaten; but on the contrary, meat of a proper age, of\r\na warm and dry nature, by no means, however, heating and exciting.\r\nBroth should be taken, seasoned with ground pepper, ginger and cloves,\r\nespecially by those who are accustomed to live temperately, and\r\nare yet choice in their diet. Sleep in the day-time is detrimental;\r\nit should be taken at night until sun-rise, or somewhat longer. At\r\nbreakfast, one should drink little; supper should be taken an hour\r\nbefore sun-set, when more may be drunk than in the morning. Clear\r\nlight wine, mixed with a fifth or sixth part of water, should be used\r\nas a beverage. Dried or fresh fruits with wine are not injurious; but\r\nhighly so without it. Beet-root and other vegetables, whether eaten\r\npickled or fresh, are hurtful; on the contrary, spicy pot-herbs, as\r\nsage or rosemary, are wholesome. Cold, moist, watery food is, in\r\ngeneral, prejudicial. Going out at night, and even until three o’clock\r\nin the morning, is dangerous, on account of the dew. Only small\r\nriver fish should be used. Too much exercise is hurtful. The body\r\nshould be kept warmer than usual, and thus protected from moisture\r\nand cold. Rain-water must not be employed in cooking, and every one\r\nshould guard against exposure to wet weather. If it rain, a little\r\nfine treacle should be taken after dinner. Fat people should not sit\r\nin the sunshine. Good clear wine should be selected and drunk often,\r\nbut in small quantities, by day. Olive oil, as an article of food,\r\nis fatal. Equally injurious are fasting or excessive abstemiousness,\r\nanxiety of mind, anger, and excessive drinking. Young people, in autumn\r\nespecially, must abstain from all these things, if they do not wish to\r\nrun a risk of dying of dysentery. In order to keep the body properly\r\nopen, an enema, or some other simple means, should be employed, when\r\nnecessary. Bathing is injurious. Men must preserve chastity as they\r\nvalue their lives. Every one should impress this on his recollection,\r\nbut especially those who reside on the coast, or upon an island into\r\nwhich the noxious wind has penetrated.”[156]\r\n\r\n  [156] _Jacob._ _Francischini de Ambrosiis._ In the Appendix to the\r\n  Istorie Pistolesi. _Muratori_, Tom. XI. p. 528.\r\n\r\nOn what occasion these strange precepts were delivered can no longer\r\nbe ascertained, even if it were an object to know it. It must be\r\nacknowledged, however, that they do not redound to the credit either\r\nof the faculty of Paris, or of the 14th century in general. This\r\nfamous faculty found themselves under the painful necessity of being\r\nwise at command, and of firing a point blank shot of erudition at an\r\nenemy who enveloped himself in a dark mist, of the nature of which\r\nthey had no conception. In concealing their ignorance by authoritative\r\nassertions, they suffered themselves, therefore, to be misled; and\r\nwhile endeavouring to appear to the world with eclat, only betrayed to\r\nthe intelligent their lamentable weakness. Now some might suppose, that\r\nin the condition of the sciences in the 14th century, no intelligent\r\nphysicians existed; but this is altogether at variance with the laws\r\nof human advancement, and is contradicted by history. The real\r\nknowledge of an age, is only shown in the archives of its literature.\r\nMen of talent here alone deposit the results of their experience and\r\nreflection, without vanity or a selfish object:--here alone the genius\r\nof truth speaks audibly. There is no ground for believing that, in the\r\n14th century, men of this kind were publicly questioned regarding their\r\nviews; and it is, therefore, the more necessary that impartial history\r\nshould take up their cause and do justice to their merits.\r\n\r\nThe first notice on this subject is due to a very celebrated teacher\r\nin Perugia, Gentilis of Foligno, who, on the 18th of June, 1348,\r\nfell a sacrifice to the plague, in the faithful discharge of his\r\nduty.[157] Attached to Arabian doctrines, and to the universally\r\nrespected Galen, he, in common with all his contemporaries, believed\r\nin a putrid corruption of the blood in the lungs and in the heart,\r\nwhich was occasioned by the pestilential atmosphere, and was forthwith\r\ncommunicated to the whole body. He thought, therefore, that everything\r\ndepended upon a sufficient purification of the air, by means of large\r\nblazing fires of odoriferous wood, in the vicinity of the healthy, as\r\nwell as of the sick, and also upon an appropriate manner of living;\r\nso that the putridity might not overpower the diseased. In conformity\r\nwith notions derived from the ancients, he depended upon bleeding\r\nand purging, at the commencement of the attack, for the purpose of\r\npurification; ordered the healthy to wash themselves frequently with\r\nvinegar or wine, to sprinkle their dwellings with vinegar, and to\r\nsmell often to camphor, or other volatile substances. Hereupon he\r\ngave, after the Arabian fashion, detailed rules, with an abundance of\r\ndifferent medicines, of whose healing powers wonderful things were\r\nbelieved. He laid little stress upon super-lunar influences, so far as\r\nrespected the malady itself; on which account, he did not enter into\r\nthe great controversies of the astrologers, but always kept in view,\r\nas an object of medical attention, the corruption of the blood in the\r\nlungs and heart. He believed in a progressive infection from country\r\nto country, according to the notions of the present day; and the\r\ncontagious power of the disease, even in the vicinity of those affected\r\nby plague, was, in his opinion, beyond all doubt.[158] On this point,\r\nintelligent contemporaries were all agreed; and in truth, it required\r\nno great genius to be convinced of so palpable a fact. Besides,\r\ncorrect notions of contagion have descended from remote antiquity, and\r\nwere maintained unchanged in the 14th century.[159] So far back as\r\nthe age of Plato, a knowledge of the contagious power of malignant\r\ninflammations of the eye, of which also no physician of the middle ages\r\nentertained a doubt,[160] was general among the people;[161] yet, in\r\nmodern times, surgeons have filled volumes with partial controversies\r\non this subject. The whole language of antiquity has adapted itself to\r\nthe notions of the people, respecting the contagion of pestilential\r\ndiseases; and their terms were, beyond comparison, more expressive than\r\nthose in use among the moderns.[162]\r\n\r\n  [157] _Gentilis de Fulgineo_, Consilia.

P. III.\r\n\r\n  [162] Compare _Marx_, Origines contagii. Caroliruh. et Bad. 1824. 8.\r\n\r\nArrangements for the protection of the healthy against contagious\r\ndiseases, the necessity of which is shewn from these notions, were\r\nregarded by the ancients as useful; and by many, whose circumstances\r\npermitted it, were carried into effect in their houses. Even a total\r\nseparation of the sick from the healthy, that indispensable means of\r\nprotection against infection by contact, was proposed by physicians\r\nof the 2nd century after Christ, in order to check the spreading of\r\nleprosy. But it was decidedly opposed, because, as it was alleged,\r\nthe healing art ought not to be guilty of such harshness.[163] This\r\nmildness of the ancients, in whose manner of thinking inhumanity was\r\nso often and so undisguisedly conspicuous, might excite surprise, if\r\nit were anything more than apparent. The true ground of the neglect of\r\npublic protection against pestilential diseases, lay in the general\r\nnotion and constitution of human society,--it lay in the disregard of\r\nhuman life, of which the great nations of antiquity have given proofs\r\nin every page of their history. Let it not be supposed that they wanted\r\nknowledge respecting the propagation of contagious diseases. On the\r\ncontrary, they were as well informed on this subject as the moderns;\r\nbut this was shewn where individual property, not where human life,\r\non the grand scale, was to be protected. Hence the ancients made a\r\ngeneral practice of arresting the progress of murrains among cattle,\r\nby a separation of the diseased from the healthy. Their herds alone\r\nenjoyed that protection which they held it impracticable to extend\r\nto human society, because they had no wish to do so.[164] That the\r\ngovernments in the 14th century, were not yet so far advanced, as\r\nto put into practice general regulations for checking the plague,\r\nneeds no especial proof. Physicians could, therefore, only advise\r\npublic purifications of the air by means of large fires, as had often\r\nbeen practised in ancient times; and they were obliged to leave it\r\nto individual families, either to seek safety in flight, or to shut\r\nthemselves up in their dwellings,[165] a method which answers in common\r\nplagues, but which here afforded no complete security, because such was\r\nthe fury of the disease when it was at its height, that the atmosphere\r\nof whole cities was penetrated by the infection.\r\n\r\n  [163] _Cael.

Amman._ “Sed\r\n  hi ægrotantem destituendum magis imperant, quam curandum, quod a se\r\n  alienum humanitas approbat medicinæ.”\r\n\r\n  [164] _Geschichte der Heilkunde_, Vol. II. p. 248.\r\n\r\n  [165] _Chalin_ assures us expressly, that many nunneries, by closing\r\n  their gates, remained free from the contagion. It is worthy of\r\n  note, and quite in conformity with the prevailing notions, that the\r\n  continuance in a thick, moist atmosphere, was generally esteemed\r\n  more advantageous and conservative, on account of its being more\r\n  impenetrable to the astral influence, inasmuch as the inferior cause\r\n  kept off the superior.--_Chalin_, p. 48.\r\n\r\nOf the astral influence which was considered to have originated the\r\n“Great Mortality,” physicians and learned men were as completely\r\nconvinced as of the fact of its reality. A grand conjunction of the\r\nthree superior planets, Saturn, Jupiter and Mars, in the sign of\r\nAquarius, which took place according to Guy de Chauliac, on the 24th\r\nof March, 1345, was generally received as its principal cause. In\r\nfixing the day, this physician, who was deeply versed in astrology,\r\ndid not agree with others; whereupon there arose various disputations,\r\nof weight in that age, but of none in ours; people, however, agreed\r\nin this--that conjunctions of the planets infallibly prognosticated\r\ngreat events; great revolutions of kingdoms, new prophets, destructive\r\nplagues, and other occurrences which bring distress and horror on\r\nmankind. No medical author of the 14th and 15th century, omits an\r\nopportunity of representing them as among the general prognostics of\r\ngreat plagues; nor can we, for our parts, regard the astrology of\r\nthe middle ages, as a mere offspring of superstition. It has not\r\nonly, in common with all ideas which inspire and guide mankind, a\r\nhigh historical importance, entirely independent of its error or\r\ntruth--for the influence of both is equally powerful--but there are\r\nalso contained in it, as in alchymy, grand thoughts of antiquity, of\r\nwhich modern natural philosophy is so little ashamed that she claims\r\nthem as her property. Foremost among these, is the idea of the general\r\nlife which diffuses itself throughout the whole universe, expressed by\r\nthe greatest Greek sages, and transmitted to the middle ages, through\r\nthe new Platonic natural philosophy. To this impression of an universal\r\norganism, the assumption of a reciprocal influence of terrestrial\r\nbodies could not be foreign,[166] nor did this cease to correspond with\r\na higher view of nature, until astrologers overstepped the limits of\r\nhuman knowledge with frivolous and mystical calculations.\r\n\r\n  [166] This was called _Affluxus_, or _Forma specifica_, and was\r\n  compared to the effect of a magnet on iron, and of amber on\r\n  chaff.--_Chalin de Vinario_, p. 23.\r\n\r\nGuy de Chauliac, considers the influence of the conjunction, which was\r\nheld to be all-potent, as the chief general cause of the Black Plague;\r\nthe diseased state of bodies, the corruption of the fluids, debility,\r\nobstruction, and so forth, as the especial subordinate causes.[167]\r\nBy these, according to his opinion, the quality of the air, and of\r\nthe other elements, was so altered, that they set poisonous fluids\r\nin motion towards the inward parts of the body, in the same manner\r\nas the magnet attracts iron; whence there arose in the commencement\r\nfever and the spitting of blood; afterwards, however, a deposition\r\nin the form of glandular swellings and inflammatory boils. Herein\r\nthe notion of an epidemic constitution was set forth, clearly and\r\nconformably, to the spirit of the age. Of contagion, Guy de Chauliac\r\nwas completely convinced. He sought to protect himself against it by\r\nthe usual means;[168] and it was probably he who advised Pope Clement\r\nVI. to shut himself up while the plague lasted. The preservation of\r\nthis pope’s life, however, was most beneficial to the city of Avignon,\r\nfor he loaded the poor with judicious acts of kindness,--took care to\r\nhave proper attendants provided, and paid physicians himself to afford\r\nassistance wherever human aid could avail; an advantage which, perhaps,\r\nno other city enjoyed.[169] Nor was the treatment of plague patients\r\nin Avignon by any means objectionable; for, after the usual depletions\r\nby bleeding and aperients, where circumstances required them, they\r\nendeavoured to bring the buboes to suppuration; they made incisions\r\ninto the inflammatory boils, or burned them with a red-hot iron, a\r\npractice which at all times proves salutary, and in the Black Plague\r\nsaved many lives. In this city, the Jews, who lived in a state of the\r\ngreatest filth, were most severely visited, as also the Spaniards, whom\r\nChalin accuses of great intemperance.[170]\r\n\r\n  [167] Causa universalis agens--causa particularis patiens. To this\r\n  correspond, in _Chalin_, the expressions Causa superior et inferior.\r\n\r\n  [168] Purging with alöetic pills; bleeding; purification of the air\r\n  by means of large fires; the use of treacle; frequent smelling to\r\n  volatile substances, of which certain “poma,” were prepared; the\r\n  internal use of Armenian bole,--a plague-remedy derived from the\r\n  Arabians, and, throughout the middle ages, much in vogue, and very\r\n  improperly used; and the employment of acescent food, in order to\r\n  resist putridity. _Guy de Chauliac_ appears to have recommended\r\n  flight to many.

I. c. 4. p. 39.\r\n\r\nStill more distinct notions on the causes of the plague were stated to\r\nhis contemporaries in the 14th century, by Galeazzo di Santa Sofia, a\r\nlearned man, a native of Padua, who likewise treated plague-patients\r\nat Vienna,[171] though in what year is undetermined. He distinguishes\r\ncarefully _pestilence_ from _epidemie_ and _endemie_. The common\r\nnotion of the two first accords exactly with that of an epidemic\r\nconstitution, for both consist, according to him, in an unknown change\r\nor corruption of the air; with this difference, that _pestilence_\r\ncalls forth diseases of different kinds; _epidemie_, on the contrary,\r\nalways the same disease. As an example of an _epidemie_, he adduces\r\na cough (influenza) which was observed in all climates at the same\r\ntime, without perceptible cause; but he recognized the approach\r\nof a _pestilence_, independently of unusual natural phenomena, by\r\nthe more frequent occurrence of various kinds of fever, to which\r\nthe modern physicians would assign a nervous and putrid character.\r\nThe _endemie_ originates, according to him, only in local telluric\r\nchanges--in deleterious influences which develope themselves in the\r\nearth and in the water, without a corruption of the air. These notions\r\nwere variously jumbled together in his time, like everything which\r\nhuman understanding separates by too fine a line of limitation.\r\nThe estimation of cosmical influences, however, in the _epidemie_\r\nand _pestilence_, is well worthy of commendation; and Santa Sofia,\r\nin this respect, not only agrees with the most intelligent persons\r\nof the 14th and 15th centuries, but he has also promulgated an\r\nopinion which must, even now, serve as a foundation for our scarcely\r\ncommenced investigations into cosmical influences.[172] _Pestilence_\r\nand _epidemie_, consist, not in alterations of the four primary\r\nqualities,[173] but in a corruption of the air, powerful, though quite\r\nimmaterial, and not cognoscible by the senses: (corruptio aëris non\r\nsubstantialis, sed qualitativa) in a disproportion of the imponderables\r\nin the atmosphere, as it would be expressed by the moderns.[174] The\r\ncauses of the _pestilence_ and _epidemie_ are, first of all, astral\r\ninfluences, especially on occasion of planetary conjunctions; then\r\nextensive putrefaction of animal and vegetable bodies, and terrestrial\r\ncorruptions (corruptio in terra); to which also, bad diet and want may\r\ncontribute. Santa Sofia considers the putrefaction of locusts, that had\r\nperished in the sea, and were again thrown up, combined with astral and\r\nterrestrial influences, as the cause of the pestilence in the eventful\r\nyear of the “Great Mortality.”\r\n\r\n  [171] Fol. 32. a. a. O.\r\n\r\n  [172] _Galeacii de Sancta Sophia_, Liber de Febribus. Venet. 1514,\r\n  fol.

The most recent observers of\r\n  malaria have stated nothing more than this.\r\n\r\nAll the fevers which were called forth by the _pestilence_, are,\r\naccording to him, of the putrid kind; for they originate principally\r\nfrom putridity of the heart’s blood, which inevitably follows the\r\ninhalation of infected air. The Oriental Plague is, sometimes, but by\r\nno means always, occasioned by _pestilence_ (?), which imparts to it\r\na character (qualitas occulta) hostile to human nature. It originates\r\nfrequently from other causes, among which, this physician was aware\r\nthat contagion was to be reckoned; and it deserves to be remarked, that\r\nhe held epidemic small-pox and measles to be infallible forerunners of\r\nthe plague, as do the physicians and people of the East[175] at the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\n  [175] Compare _Enr. di Wolmar_, Abhandlung über die Pest. Berlin,\r\n  1827. 8vo.\r\n\r\nIn the exposition of his therapeutical views of the plague, a clearness\r\nof intellect is again shewn by Santa Sofia, which reflects credit on\r\nthe age. It seemed to him to depend, 1st, on an evacuation of putrid\r\nmatters, by purgatives and bleeding: yet he did not sanction the\r\nemployment of these means indiscriminately, and without consideration;\r\nleast of all where the condition of the blood was healthy. He also\r\ndeclared himself decidedly against bleeding ad deliquium (venæ sectio\r\neradicativa). 2d, Strengthening of the heart and prevention of\r\nputrescence. 3d, Appropriate regimen. 4th, Improvement of the air.\r\n5th, Appropriate treatment of tumid glands and inflammatory boils,\r\nwith emollient, or even stimulating poultices (mustard, lily-bulbs),\r\nas well as with red-hot gold and iron. Lastly, 6th, Attention to\r\nprominent symptoms. The stores of the Arabian pharmacy, which he\r\nbrought into action to meet all these indications, were indeed very\r\nconsiderable; it is to be observed, however, that, for the most part,\r\ngentle means were accumulated, which in case of abuse, would do no\r\nharm; for the character of the Arabian system of medicine, whose\r\nprinciples were everywhere followed at this time, was mildness and\r\ncaution. On this account too, we cannot believe that a very prolix\r\ntreatise by Marsigli di Santa Sofia,[176] a contemporary relative of\r\nGaleazzo, on the prevention and treatment of plague, can have caused\r\nmuch harm, although, perhaps, even in the 14th century, an agreeable\r\nlatitude and confident assertions respecting things which no mortal\r\nhas investigated, or which it is quite a matter of indifference to\r\ndistinguish, were considered as proofs of a valuable practical talent.\r\n\r\n  [176] Tractatus de Febribus, fol. 48.\r\n\r\nThe agreement of contemporary and later writers, shews that the\r\npublished views of the most celebrated physicians of the 14th century,\r\nwere those generally adopted. Among these, Chalin de Vinario is\r\nthe most experienced. Though devoted to astrology, still more than\r\nhis distinguished contemporary, he acknowledges the great power of\r\nterrestrial influences, and expresses himself very sensibly on the\r\nindisputable doctrine of contagion, endeavouring thereby to apologize\r\nfor many surgeons and physicians of his time, who neglected their\r\nduty.[177] He asserted boldly, and with truth, “_that all epidemic\r\ndiseases might become contagious,[178] and all fevers epidemic_,”\r\nwhich attentive observers of all subsequent ages have confirmed.\r\n\r\n  [177] De Peste Liber, pura latinitate donatus a _Jacobo Dalechampio_,\r\n  Lugdun. 1552. 16. p. 40. 188. “Longe tamen plurimi congressu eorum\r\n  qui fuerunt in locis pestilentibus periclitantur et gravissime,\r\n  quoniam e causa duplici, nempe et aëris vitio, et eorum qui versantur\r\n  nobiscum, vitio. _Hoc itaque modo fit, ut unius accessu in totam modo\r\n  familiam, modo civitatem, modo villam, pestis invehatur._” Compare\r\n  p. 20, “Solæ privatorum aedes pestem sentiunt, _si adeat qui in\r\n  pestilenti loco versatus est_.”--“Nobis proximi ipsi sumus, nemoque\r\n  est tanta occœcatus amentia, qui de sua salute potius quam aliorum\r\n  sollicitus non sit, maxime in contagione tam cita et rapida.” Rather\r\n  a loose principle, which might greatly encourage low sentiments, and\r\n  much endanger the honor of the medical profession, but which, in\r\n  _Chalin_, who was aware of the impossibility of avoiding contagion in\r\n  uncleanly dwellings, is so far excusable, that he did not apply it to\r\n  himself.\r\n\r\n  [178] Morbos omnes pestilentes contagiosos, audacter ego equidem\r\n  pronuntio et assevero, p. 149.\r\n\r\nHe delivered his sentiments on blood-letting with sagacity, as an\r\nexperienced physician; yet he was unable, as may be imagined, to\r\nmoderate the desire for bleeding shewn by the ignorant monks. He was\r\naverse to draw blood from the veins of patients under fourteen years\r\nof age; but counteracted inflammatory excitement in them by cupping;\r\nand endeavoured to moderate the inflammation of the tumid glands by\r\nleeches.[179] Most of those who were bled, died; he therefore reserved\r\nthis remedy for the plethoric; especially for the papal courtiers,\r\nand the hypocritical priests, whom he saw gratifying their sensual\r\ndesires, and imitating Epicurus, whilst they pompously pretended to\r\nfollow Christ.[180] He recommended burning the boils with a red-hot\r\niron, only in the plague without fever, which occurred in single\r\ncases;[181] and was always ready to correct those over-hasty surgeons,\r\nwho, with fire and violent remedies, did irremediable injury to their\r\npatients,[182] Michael Savonarola, professor in Ferrara (1462),\r\nreasoning on the susceptibility of the human frame to the influence of\r\npestilential infection, as the cause of such various modifications of\r\ndisease, expresses himself as a modern physician would on this point;\r\nand an adoption of the principle of contagion, was the foundation of\r\nhis definition of the plague.[183] No less worthy of observation are\r\nthe views of the celebrated Valescus of Taranta, who, during the final\r\nvisitation of the Black Death, in 1382, practised as a physician at\r\nMontpellier, and handed down to posterity what has been repeated in\r\ninnumerable treatises on plague, which were written during the 15th and\r\n16th centuries.[184]\r\n\r\n  [179] Vide preceding note, p. 162. 163.\r\n\r\n  [180] Ibid. p. 97. 166. “Qualis (vita) esse solet eorum, qui\r\n  sacerdotiorum et cultus divini prætextu, genio plus satis indulgent\r\n  et obsequuntur, ac Christum speciosis titulis ementientes, Epicurum\r\n  imitantur.” Certainly a remarkable freedom of sentiment for the 14th\r\n  century.\r\n\r\n  [181] Ibid. p. 183. 151.\r\n\r\n  [182] Ibid. p. 159. 189.\r\n\r\n  [183] Canonica de Febribus, ad Raynerium Siculum, 1487, s. l.,\r\n  cap. 10, sine pag. “Febris pestilentialis est febris contagiosa ex\r\n  ebullitione putrefactiva in altero quatuor humorum cordi propinquorum\r\n  principaliter.”\r\n\r\n  [184] _Valesci de Tharanta_, Philonium.

Those who attended upon a plague patient, were\r\nto remain apart for ten days, before they again associated with any\r\nbody. The priests were to examine the diseased, and point out to\r\nspecial commissioners, the persons infected; under punishment of\r\nthe confiscation of their goods, and of being burned alive. Whoever\r\nimported the plague, the state condemned his goods to confiscation.\r\nFinally, none except those who were appointed for that purpose, were to\r\nattend plague-patients, under penalty of death and confiscation.[185]\r\n\r\n  [185] Chronicon Regiense, _Muratori_, Tom. XVIII. p. 82.\r\n\r\nThese orders, in correspondence with the spirit of the 14th century,\r\nare sufficiently decided to indicate a recollection of the good effects\r\nof confinement, and of keeping at a distance those suspected of having\r\nplague. It was said that Milan itself, by a rigorous barricado of\r\nthree houses in which the plague had broken out, maintained itself\r\nfree from the “_Great Mortality_,” for a considerable time;[186] and\r\nexamples of the preservation of individual families, by means of a\r\nstrict separation, were certainly very frequent. That these orders must\r\nhave caused universal affliction from their uncommon severity, as we\r\nknow to have been especially the case in the city of Reggio, may be\r\neasily conceived; but Bernabo did not suffer himself to be frightened\r\nfrom his purpose--on the contrary, when the plague returned in the\r\nyear 1383, he forbad the admission of people from infected places into\r\nhis territories, on pain of death.[187] We have now, it is true, no\r\naccount how far he succeeded; yet it is to be supposed that he arrested\r\nthe disease, for it had long lost the property of the Black Death, to\r\nspread abroad in the air the contagious matter which proceeded from the\r\nlungs, charged with putridity, and to taint the atmosphere of whole\r\ncities by the vast numbers of the sick. Now that it had resumed its\r\nmilder form, so that it infected only by contact, it admitted being\r\nconfined within individual dwellings, as easily as in modern times.\r\n\r\n  [186] _Adr. Chenot_, Hinterlassene Abhandlungen über die ärztlichen\r\n  und politischen Anstalten bei der Pestseuche, Wien, 1798, 8vo.\r\n  p. 146. From this period it was common in the middle ages to\r\n  barricade the doors and windows of houses infected with plague, and\r\n  to suffer the inhabitants to perish without mercy.--_S. Möhsen_, Loc.\r\n  cit.\r\n\r\n  [187] Chron. Reg. Loc. cit.\r\n\r\nBernabo’s example was imitated; nor was there any century more\r\nappropriate for recommending to governments strong regulations against\r\nthe plague, than the 14th; for when it broke out in Italy, in the year\r\n1399, and still demanded new victims, it was for the 16th time; without\r\nreckoning frequent visitations of measles and small-pox. In this same\r\nyear, Viscount John, in milder terms than his predecessor, ordered that\r\nno stranger should be admitted from infected places, and that the city\r\ngates should be strictly guarded. Infected houses were to be ventilated\r\nfor at least eight or ten days, and purified from noxious vapours\r\nby fires, and by fumigations with balsamic and aromatic substances.\r\nStraw, rags, and the like, were to be burned; and the bedsteads which\r\nhad been used, set out for four days in the rain or the sunshine, so\r\nthat, by means of the one or the other, the morbific vapour might be\r\ndestroyed. No one was to venture to make use of clothes or beds out of\r\ninfected dwellings, unless they had been previously washed and dried\r\neither at the fire or in the sun. People were, likewise, to avoid,\r\nas long as possible, occupying houses which had been frequented by\r\nplague-patients.[188]\r\n\r\n  [188] _Muratori_, Tom. XVI., p.560.--Compare _Chenot_, loc. cit.\r\n  p. 146.\r\n\r\nWe cannot precisely perceive in these an advance towards general\r\nregulations; and perhaps people were convinced of the insurmountable\r\nimpediments which opposed the separation of open inland countries,\r\nwhere bodies of people connected together could not be brought, even\r\nby the most obdurate severity, to renounce the habit of a profitable\r\nintercourse.\r\n\r\nDoubtless it is Nature which has done the most to banish the Oriental\r\nplague from western Europe, where the increasing cultivation of the\r\nearth, and the advancing order in civilized society, prevented it from\r\nremaining domesticated; which it most probably had been in the more\r\nancient times.\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth century, during which it broke out seventeen times\r\nin different places in Europe[189], it was of the more consequence\r\nto oppose a barrier to its entrance from Asia, Africa, and Greece\r\n(which had become Turkish); for it would have been difficult for\r\nit to maintain itself indigenously any longer. Among the southern\r\ncommercial states, however, which were called on to make the greatest\r\nexertions to this end, it was principally Venice, formerly so severely\r\nattacked by the black plague, that put the necessary restraint upon\r\nthe perilous profits of the merchant. Until towards the end of the\r\nfifteenth century, the very considerable intercourse with the East was\r\nfree and unimpeded. Ships of commercial cities had often brought over\r\nthe plague: nay, the former irruption of the _great mortality_ itself\r\nhad been occasioned by navigators. For, as in the latter end of Autumn,\r\n1347, four ships full of plague-patients returned from the Levant to\r\nGenoa, the disease spread itself there with astonishing rapidity. On\r\nthis account, in the following year, the Genoese forbid the entrance of\r\nsuspected ships into their port. These sailed to Pisa and other cities\r\non the coast, where already Nature had made such mighty preparations\r\nfor the reception of the Black Plague, and what we have already\r\ndescribed took place in consequence.[190]\r\n\r\n  [189] _Papon_, loc. cit.\r\n\r\n  [190] _Chenot_, p. 145.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1485, when, among the cities of northern Italy, Milan\r\nespecially felt the scourge of the plague, a special council of health,\r\nconsisting of three nobles, was established at Venice, who probably\r\ntried every thing in their power to prevent the entrance of this\r\ndisease, and gradually called into activity all those regulations\r\nwhich have served in later times as a pattern for the other southern\r\nstates of Europe. Their endeavours were, however, not crowned with\r\ncomplete success; on which account their powers were increased, in the\r\nyear 1504, by granting them the right of life and death over those who\r\nviolated the regulations.[191] Bills of health were probably first\r\nintroduced in the year 1527, during a fatal plague[192] which visited\r\nItaly for five years (1525–30), and called forth redoubled caution.\r\n\r\n  [191] _Le Bret_, Staatsgeschichte der Republik Venedig.

Here all strangers\r\ncoming from places where the existence of plague was suspected were\r\ndetained. If it appeared in the city itself, the sick were despatched\r\nwith their families to what was called the Old Lazaretto, were there\r\nfurnished with provisions and medicines, and, when they were cured,\r\nwere detained, together with all those who had had intercourse with\r\nthem, still forty days longer in the New Lazaretto, situated on another\r\nisland. All these regulations were every year improved, and their\r\nneedful rigour was increased, so that from the year 1585 onwards no\r\nappeal was allowed from the sentence of the Council of Health; and\r\nthe other commercial nations gradually came to the support of the\r\nVenetians, by adopting corresponding regulations.[193] Bills of health,\r\nhowever, were not general until the year 1665.[194]\r\n\r\n  [193] _Le Bret_, loc. cit. Compare Hamburger Remarquen of the year\r\n  1700, p. 282 and 305.\r\n\r\n  [194] Göttinger gelehrte Anzeigen, 1772, p. 22.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of a forty days’ detention, whence quarantines derive\r\ntheir name, was not dictated by caprice, but probably had a medical\r\norigin, which is derivable in part from the doctrine of critical\r\ndays; for the fortieth day, according to the most ancient notions,\r\nhas been always regarded as the last of ardent diseases, and the\r\nlimit of separation between these and those which are chronic. It was\r\nthe custom to subject lying-in women for forty days to a more exact\r\nsuperintendance. There was a good deal also said in medical works of\r\nforty day epochs in the formation of the fœtus, not to mention that\r\nthe alchymists expected more durable revolutions in forty days, which\r\nperiod they called the philosophical month.\r\n\r\nThis period being generally held to prevail in natural processes, it\r\nappeared reasonable to assume and legally to establish it as that\r\nrequired for the development of latent principles of contagion, since\r\npublic regulations cannot dispense with decisions of this kind, even\r\nthough they should not be wholly justified by the nature of the case.\r\nGreat stress has likewise been laid on theological and legal grounds\r\nwhich were certainly of greater weight in the fifteenth century than\r\nin more modern times.[195]\r\n\r\n  [195] The forty days’ duration of the Flood, the forty days’\r\n  sojourn of Moses on Mount Sinai, our Saviour’s fast for the same\r\n  length of time in the wilderness; lastly, what is called the Saxon\r\n  term (Sächsische Frist,) which lasts for forty days, &c.

Anno\r\n    1348._\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Honorable the Mayor, Senate and Citizens of the City of\r\nStrasburg, the Castellan of Chillon, Deputy of the Bailiff of Chablais,\r\nsendeth greeting with all due submission and respect.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that you desire to be made acquainted with the confession\r\nof the Jews, and the proofs brought forward against them, I certify, by\r\nthese presents, to you, and each of you that desires to be informed,\r\nthat they of Berne have had a copy of the inquisition and confession\r\nof the Jews who lately resided in the places specified, and who were\r\naccused of putting poison into the wells and several other places: as\r\nalso the most conclusive evidence of the truth of the charge preferred\r\nagainst them. Many Jews were put to the question, others being excused\r\nfrom it, because they confessed, and were brought to trial and burnt.\r\nSeveral Christians, also, who had poïson given them by the Jews for\r\nthe purpose of destroying the Christians, were put on the wheel and\r\ntortured. This burning of the Jews and torturing of the said Christians\r\ntook place in many parts of the county of Savoy.\r\n\r\n    Fare you well.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    _The Confession made on the 15th day of September, in the year\r\n    of our Lord 1348, in the Castle of Chillon, by the Jews arrested\r\n    in Neustadt, on the Charge of Poisoning the Wells, Springs and\r\n    other places; also Food &c., with the Design of destroying and\r\n    extirpating all Christians._\r\n\r\nI. Balavignus, a Jewish physician, inhabitant of Thonon, was arrested\r\nat Chillon in consequence of being found in the neighbourhood. He was\r\nput for a short time to the rack, and, on being taken down, confessed,\r\nafter much hesitation, that, about ten weeks before, the Rabbi Jacob\r\nof Toledo, who because of a citation, had resided at Chamberi since\r\nEaster, sent him, by a Jewish boy, some poison in the mummy of an\r\negg: it was a powder sewed up in a thin leathern pouch accompanied by\r\na letter, commanding him, on penalty of excommunication, and by his\r\nrequired obedience to the law, to throw this poison into the larger\r\nand more frequented wells of the town of Thonon, to poison those\r\nwho drew water there. He was further enjoined not to communicate\r\nthe circumstance to any person whatever, under the same penalty. In\r\nconformity with this command of the Jewish rabbis and doctors of the\r\nlaw, he, Balavignus, distributed the poison in several places, and\r\nacknowledged having one evening placed a certain portion under a stone\r\nin a spring on the shore at Thonon. He further confessed that the said\r\nboy brought various letters of a similar import, addressed to others\r\nof his nation, and particularly specified some directed severally to\r\nMossoiet, Banditon, and Samoleto of Neustadt; to Musseo Abramo and\r\nAquetus of Montreantz, Jews residing at Thurn in Vivey; to Benetonus\r\nand his son at St. Moritz; to Vivianus Jacobus, Aquetus and Sonetus,\r\nJews at Aquani. Several letters of a like nature were sent to Abram\r\nand Musset, Jews at Moncheoli; and the boy told him that he had taken\r\nmany others to different and distant places, but he did not recollect\r\nto whom they were addressed. Balavignus further confessed that, after\r\nhaving put the poison into the spring at Thonon, he had positively\r\nforbidden his wife and children to drink the water, but had not\r\nthought fit to assign a reason. He avowed the truth of this statement,\r\nand, in the presence of several credible witnesses, swore by his Law,\r\nand the Five Books of Moses to every item of his deposition.\r\n\r\nOn the day following, Balavignus, voluntarily and without torture,\r\nratified the above confession verbatim before many persons of\r\ncharacter, and, of his own accord, acknowledged that, on returning one\r\nday from Tour near Vivey, he had thrown into a well below Mustruez,\r\nnamely that of La Conerayde, a quantity of the poison tied up in a rag,\r\ngiven to him for the purpose by Aquetus of Montreantz, an inhabitant of\r\nthe said Tour: that he had acquainted Manssiono, and his son Delosaz,\r\nresidents of Neustadt, with the circumstance of his having done so, and\r\nadvertised them not to drink of the water. He described the colour of\r\nthe poison as being red and black.\r\n\r\nOn the nineteenth day of September, the above-named Balavignus\r\nconfessed, without torture, that about three weeks after Whitsuntide,\r\na Jew named Mussus told him that he had thrown poison into the well\r\nin the custom-house of that place, the property of the Borneller\r\nfamily; and that he no longer drank the water of this well, but that\r\nof the lake. He further deposed that Mussus informed him that he had\r\nalso laid some of the poison under the stones in the custom-house at\r\nChillon. Search was accordingly made in this well, and the poison\r\nfound: some of it was given to a Jew by way of trial, and he died\r\nin consequence. He also stated that the rabbis had ordered him and\r\nother Jews to refrain from drinking of the water for nine days after\r\nthe poison was infused into it; and, immediately on having poisoned\r\nthe waters, he communicated the circumstance to the other Jews. He,\r\nBalavignus, confessed that about two months previously, being at Evian,\r\nhe had some conversation on the subject with a Jew called Jacob, and,\r\namong other things, asked him whether he also had received writings\r\nand poison, and was answered in the affirmative; he then questioned\r\nhim whether he had obeyed the command, and Jacob replied that he had\r\nnot, but had given the poison to Savetus, a Jew, who had thrown it\r\ninto the Well de Morer at Evian. Jacob also desired him, Balavignus,\r\nto execute the command imposed on him with due caution. He confessed\r\nthat Aquetus of Montreantz had informed him that he had thrown some of\r\nthe poison into the well above Tour, the water of which he sometimes\r\ndrank. He confessed that Samolet had told him that he had laid the\r\npoison which he had received in a well, which, however, he refused to\r\nname to him. Balavignus, as a physician, further deposed that a person\r\ninfected by such poison coming in contact with another while in a state\r\nof perspiration, infection would be the almost inevitable result; as\r\nmight also happen from the breath of an infected person. This fact\r\nhe believed to be correct, and was confirmed in his opinion by the\r\nattestation of many experienced physicians. He also declared that none\r\nof his community could exculpate themselves from this accusation, as\r\nthe plot was communicated to all; and that all were guilty of the above\r\ncharges. Balavignus was conveyed over the lake from Chillon to Clarens,\r\nto point out the well into which he confessed having thrown the powder.\r\nOn landing, he was conducted to the spot; and, having seen the well,\r\nacknowledged that to be the place, saying, “This is the well into which\r\nI put the poison.” The well was examined in his presence, and the linen\r\ncloth in which the poison had been wrapped was found in the waste-pipe\r\nby a notary-public named Heinrich Gerhard, in the presence of many\r\npersons, and was shewn to the said Jew. He acknowledged this to be the\r\nlinen which had contained the poison, which he described as being of\r\ntwo colours, red and black, but said that he had thrown it into the\r\nopen well. The linen cloth was taken away and is preserved.\r\n\r\nBalavignus, in conclusion, attests the truth of all and every thing\r\nas above related. He believes this poison to contain a portion of the\r\nbasilisk, because he had heard, and felt assured, that the above poison\r\ncould not be prepared without it.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Banditono, a Jew of Neustadt, was, on the fifteenth day of\r\nSeptember, subjected for a short time to the torture. After a long\r\ninterval, he confessed having cast a quantity of poison, about the size\r\nof a large nut, given him by Musseus, a Jew, at Tour near Vivey, into\r\nthe well of Carutet, in order to poison those who drank of it.\r\n\r\nThe following day, Banditono, voluntarily and without torture, attested\r\nthe truth of the aforesaid deposition; and also confessed that the\r\nRabbi Jacob von Pasche, who came from Toledo and had settled at\r\nChamberi, sent him, at Pilliex, by a Jewish servant, some poison about\r\nthe size of a large nut, together with a letter, directing him to throw\r\nthe powder into the wells on pain of excommunication. He had therefore\r\nthrown the poison, which was sewn up in a leathern bag, into the well\r\nof Cercliti de Roch; further, also, that he saw many other letters in\r\nthe hands of the servant addressed to different Jews; that he had also\r\nseen the said servant deliver one, on the outside of the upper gate, to\r\nSamuletus, the Jew, at Neustadt. He stated, also, that the Jew Massolet\r\nhad informed him that he had put poison into the well near the bridge\r\nat Vivey.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. The said Manssiono, Jew of Neustadt, was put upon the rack on\r\nthe fifteenth day of the same month, but refused to admit the above\r\ncharge, protesting his entire ignorance of the whole matter; but the\r\nday following, he, voluntarily and without any torture, confessed,\r\nin the presence of many persons, that he came from Mancheolo one day\r\nin last Whitsunweek, in company with a Jew named Provenzal, and, on\r\nreaching the well of Chabloz Crüez between Vyona and Mura, the latter\r\nsaid, “You must put some of the poison which I will give you into that\r\nwell, or woe betide you!” He therefore took a portion of the powder\r\nabout the bigness of a nut, and did as he was directed. He believed\r\nthat the Jews in the neighbourhood of Evian had convened a council\r\namong themselves relative to this plot, before Whitsuntide. He further\r\nsaid that Balavignus had informed him of his having poisoned the Well\r\nde la Conerayde below Mustruez. He also affirmed his conviction of the\r\nculpability of the Jews in this affair, stating that they were fully\r\nacquainted with all the particulars, and guilty of the alleged crime.\r\n\r\nOn the third day of the October following, Manssiono was brought before\r\nthe commissioners, and did not in the least vary from his former\r\ndeposition, or deny having put the poison into the said wells.\r\n\r\nThe above-named Jews, prior to their execution, solemnly swore by\r\ntheir Law to the truth of their several depositions, and declared that\r\nall Jews whatsoever, from seven years old and upwards, could not be\r\nexempted from the charge of guilt, as all of them were acquainted with\r\nthe plot, and more or less participators in the crime.\r\n\r\n[_The seven other examinations scarcely differ from the above, except\r\nin the names of the accused, and afford but little variety. We will,\r\ntherefore, only add a characteristic passage at the conclusion of this\r\ndocument. The whole speaks for itself._]\r\n\r\nThere still remain numerous proofs and accusations against the\r\nabove-mentioned Jews: also against Jews and Christians in different\r\nparts of the county of Savoy, who have already received the punishment\r\ndue to their heinous crime; which, however, I have not at hand, and\r\ncannot therefore send you. I must add that all the Jews of Neustadt\r\nwere burnt according to the just sentence of the law. At Augst, I was\r\npresent when three Christians were flayed on account of being accessory\r\nto the plot of poisoning. Very many Christians were arrested for this\r\ncrime in various places in this country, especially at Evian, Gebenne,\r\nKrusilien and Hochstett, who, at last and in their dying moments, were\r\nbrought to confess and acknowledge that they had received the poison\r\nfrom the Jews. Of these Christians some have been quartered; others\r\nflayed and afterwards hanged. Certain commissioners have been appointed\r\nby the magistrates to enforce judgment against all the Jews; and I\r\nbelieve that none will escape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nExtracts from “A Boke or Counseill against the Disease commonly called\r\nthe Sweate or Sweatyng Sicknesse,” made by John Caius, Doctour in\r\nPhisicke.-- Emprinted at London.

By the time of the yeare vnnaturall, as if winter be hot &\r\ndrie, somer hot & moist (a fit time for sweates) the spring colde and\r\ndrye, the fall hot & moist. To this mai be ioyned the euel disposition\r\nby constellation, whiche hath a great power & dominion in al erthly\r\nthinges. By the site & nature of the soile & region, many wayes. First\r\nand specially, by euel mistes & exhalations drawen out of the grounde\r\nby the sunne in the heate of the yeare, as chanced among the Grekes in\r\nthe siege of Troy, whereby died firste dogges & mules, after, men in\r\ngreat numbre: & here also in England in this M.D.L.I. yeare, the cause\r\nof this pestilent sweate, but of dyuers nature. Whiche miste in the\r\ncountrie wher it began, was sene flie from toune to toune, with suche a\r\nstincke in morninges & euenings, that men could scarcely abide it. Then\r\nby dampes out of the earth, as out of Galenes Barathrum, or the poetes\r\nauernum, or aornum, the dampes wherof be such, that thei kil y^e birdes\r\nflieng ouer them. Of like dampes, I heard in the north country in cole\r\npits, wherby the laboring men be streight killed, except before the\r\nhoure of coming therof (which thei know by y^e flame of their candle)\r\nthei auoid the ground. Thirdly by putrefaction or rot in groundes aftre\r\ngreat flouddes, in carions & in dead men. After great fluddes, as\r\nhappened in y^e time of Gallien the Emperor at Rome, in Achaia & Libia,\r\nwher the seas sodeinly did ouerflow y^e cities nigh to y^e same. And in\r\nthe XI yeare of Pelagius, when al the flouddes throughe al Italye didde\r\nrage, but chieflye Tibris at Rome, whiche in many places was as highe\r\nas the walles of the citie.\r\n\r\nIn carions or dead bodies, as fortuned here in Englande upon the sea\r\nbanckes in the tyme of King Alured or Alfrede (as some Chroniclers\r\nwrite) but in the time of Ethelred after Sabellicus, by occasion of\r\ndrowned Locustes cast up by the Sea, which by a wynde were driuen\r\noute of Fraunce thether. This locust is a flie in bignes of a manne’s\r\nthumbe, in colour broune, in shape somewhat like a greshopper, hauing\r\nVI fiete, so many wynges, two tiethe, & an hedde like a horse, and\r\ntherfore called in Italy Caualleto, where ouer y^e citie of Padoa, in\r\nthe yere M.D.XIII. (as I remembre,) I, with manye more did see a swarme\r\nof theim, whose passage ouer the citie, did laste two hours, in breadth\r\ninestimable to euery man there. Here by example to note infection\r\nby deadde menne in Warres . either in rotting aboue the ground, as\r\nchaunced in Athenes by theim of Ethiopia, or else in beyng buried\r\nouerly as happened at Bulloigne, in the yere M.D.XIV. the yeare aftre\r\nKing Henrye theight had conquered the same, or by long continuance of\r\nan hoste in one place, it is more playne by dayly experience, then it\r\nneadeth to be shewed.\r\n\r\nTherefore I wil now go to the fourth especial cause of infection, the\r\npent aier, breaking out of the ground in yearthquakes, as chaunced at\r\nVenice in the firste yeare of Andrea Dandulo, then Duke, the XXIV day\r\nof Januarye, and XX hour after their computacion. By which infection\r\nmani died, & many wer borne before their time. The V cause is close\r\n& unstirred aire & therfore putrified or currupt, out of old welles,\r\nholes in y^e ground made for grain, wherof many I did se in & about\r\nPesaro in Italy, by opening them aftre a great space, as both those\r\ncountrimen do confesse & also by example is declared, for y^t manye\r\nin opening them unwarely be killed. Out of caues and tombes also, as\r\nchaunced first in the country of Babilonia, proceding aftre into\r\nGrece, and so to Rome, by occasion that y^e souldiers of themperour\r\nMarcus Antoninus, upon hope of money, brake up a golden coffine of\r\nAuidius Cassius, spieng a little hole therin, in the temple of Apollo\r\nin Seleucia, as Ammianus Marcellinus writeth. To these mai be ioyned\r\nthe particular causes of infection, which I cal the accidentes of the\r\nplace, augmenting the same. As nigh to dwelling places, merishe & muddy\r\ngroundes, puddles or donghilles, sinckes or canales, easing places or\r\ncarions, deadde ditches or rotten groundes, close aier in houses or\r\nualleis, with such like. Thus muche for the firste cause.\r\n\r\nThe second cause of this Englyshe Ephemera, I said were thimpure\r\nspirites in bodies corupt by repletion. Repletion I cal here, abundance\r\nof humores euel & maliciouse, from long time by little and little\r\ngathered by euel diete, remaining in the bodye, coming either by to\r\nmoche meate, or by euel meate in qualitie, as infected frutes, meates\r\nof euel juse or nutriment: or both ioyntly. To such spirites when the\r\naire infective cometh consonant, then be thei distempered, corrupted,\r\nsore handled, & oppressed, then nature is forced & the disease\r\nengendred. But while I doe declare these impure spirites to be one\r\ncause, I must remoue your myndes from spirites to humours, for that\r\nthe spirites be fedde of the finest partes therof, & aftre bringe you\r\nagaine to spirites where I toke you. And for so muche as I haue not yet\r\nforgotten to whome I write, in this declaration I will leaue apart al\r\nlearned & subtil reasons, as here void & vnmiete & only vse suche as\r\nbe most euident to whom I write, & easiest to be understanden of the\r\nsame: and at ones therwith shew also why it haunteth us Englishmen more\r\nthen other nations. Therfore I passe ouer the vngentle sauoure or smell\r\nof the sweate, grosenes, colour, and other qualities of the same, the\r\nquantitie, the daunger in stopping, the maner in coming furthe redily,\r\nor hardly, hot or cold, the notes in the excrementes, the state longer\r\nor sorer, with suche others, which mai be tokens of corrupt humours &\r\nspirites, & onli wil stand vpon III reasons declaring y^e same swet by\r\ngret repletion to be in vs not otherwise for al y^e euel aire apt to\r\nthis disease, more then other nations. For as heraftre I wil shew, &\r\nGalen confirmeth, our bodies cannot suffre any thing or hurt by corrupt\r\n& infectiue causes, except ther be in them a certein mater prepared apt\r\n& like to receiue it, els if one were sick, al shuld be sick, if in\r\nthis countri, in al countries wher the infection came, which thing we\r\nse doth not chance. For touching the first reason, we se this sweting\r\nsicknes or pestilent Ephemera to be oft in England, but neuer entreth\r\nScotland, (except the borders) albeit thei both be joinctly within the\r\ncompas of on sea. The same beginning here, hath assailed Brabant & the\r\ncostes nigh to it, but neuer passed Germany, where ones it was in like\r\nfacion as here, with great mortalitie, in the yere M.D.XXIX. Cause\r\nwherof none other there is naturall, then the euell diet of these thre\r\ncountryes whiche destroy more meates and drynckes withoute al ordre,\r\nconuenient time, reason, or necessitie, then either Scotlande, or\r\nall other countries vnder the sunne, to the greate annoiance of their\r\nowne bodies and wittes, hinderance of theim which haue nede, and great\r\ndearth and scarcitie in their common welthes. Wherfore if Esculapius\r\nthe inuentour of Phisike, y^e sauer of men from death, & restorer to\r\nlife, should returne again into this world, he could not saue these\r\nsortes of men, hauing so moche sweatyng stuffe, so many euill humoures\r\nlaid by in store, from this displeasante, feareful, & pestilent\r\ndisease: except thei would learne a new lession, & folowe a new trade.\r\nFor otherwise, neither the auoidyng of this countrie (the seconde\r\nreason) nor fleying into others, (a commune refuge in other diseases)\r\nwyll preserue us Englishe men, as in this laste sweate is by experience\r\nwell proued in Cales, Antwerpe, and other places of Brabant, wher only\r\nour contrimen ware sicke and none others, except one or ii. others of\r\nthenglishe diete, which is also to be noted. (Fol. 13 to 17.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe thirde and laste reason is, y^t they which had thys sweat sore\r\nwith perille or death, were either men of welthe, ease & welfare, or\r\nof the poorer sorte such as wer idle persones, good ale drinkers, and\r\nTavern-haunters. For these, by y^e great welfare of the one sorte,\r\nand large drinkyng of thother, heped up in their bodies moche euill\r\nmatter: by their ease and idlenes, coulde not waste and consume it. A\r\nconfirmacion of this is, that the laborouse and thinne dieted people,\r\neither had it not, because they dyd eate but litle to make the matter:\r\nor with no greate grefe and danger, because they laboured out moche\r\ntherof. Wherefore upon small cause, necessarily must folowe a small\r\neffecte. All these reasones go to this ende, that persones of all\r\ncountries of moderate and good diete, escape thys Englishe Ephemera,\r\nand those be onely vexed therewith, whiche be of immoderate and euill\r\ndiete. But why? for the euill humores and corrupte aier alone? No . for\r\nthen the pestilence and not the swet should rise. For what then? for\r\ny^e impure spirites corrupte in theimselues and by the infectiue aier.\r\nWhy so? for that of impure and corrupte humores, whether thei be blode\r\nor others, can rise none other then impure spirites. For euery thynge\r\nis such as that wherof it commeth. Now, that of the beste and fineste\r\nof the blode, yea in corrupte bodies (whyche beste is nought) these\r\nspirites be ingendred and fedde I before expressed. Therfor who wyl\r\nhaue them pure and cleane, and himselfe free from sweat, muste kepe a\r\npure and cleane diete, and then he shall be sure. (Fol. 20 to 21.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWho that lustethe to lyue in quiete suretie, out of the sodaine danger\r\nof this Englishe Ephemera, he aboue all thynges, of litle and good\r\nmuste eate & spare not; the last parte wherof wyl please well (I doubt\r\nnot) us Englishe men: the firste I thinke neuer a deale. Yet it must\r\nplease theim that intende to lyue without the reche of this disease.\r\nSo doyng they shall easely escape it. For of that is good, can be\r\nengendred no euill: of that is litle, can be gathered no great store.\r\nTherfore helthful must he nedes be and free from this disease, that\r\nvsethe this kinde of liuynge and maner in dietynge. An example hereof\r\nmay the wise man Socrates be, which by this sorte of diete escaped a\r\nsore pestilence in Athenes, neuer fleynge ne kepyng close him selfe\r\nfrom the same. Truly who will lyue accordynge to nature and not to\r\nlust, may with this diete be well contented. For nature is pleased\r\nwith a litle, nor seketh other then that the mind voide of cares and\r\nfeares may be in quiete merily, and the body voide of grefe, maye be in\r\nlife swetly, as Lucretius writeth. Here at large to ronne out vntill\r\nmy breth wer spent, as vpon a common place, against y^e intemperance\r\nor excessive diete of Englande, thincommodities & displeasures of the\r\nsame many waies: and contrarie, in commendation of meane diete and\r\ntemperance (called of Plato sophrosyne, for that it conserueth wisdome)\r\nand the thousande commodities thereof, both for helthe, welthe, witte\r\nand longe life, well I might, & lose my laboure: such be our Englishe\r\nfacions rather then reasones. But for that I purpose neither to wright\r\na longe worke but a shorte counseill, nor to wery the reders with\r\nthat they luste not to here, I will lette that passe, and moue them\r\nthat desire further to knowe my mynde therin, to remember that I sayd\r\nbefore, of litle & good eate and spare not, wherby they shall easely\r\nperceiue my meanyng. I therefore go furth with my diete, wherin my\r\ncounseill is, that the meates be helthfull, and holsomly kylled, swetly\r\nsaued, and wel prepared in rostyng, sethyng, baking, & so furth. The\r\nbread of swet corne, wel leuened, & so baked. The drinke of swete\r\nmalte and good water kyndly brued, without other drosse now a daies\r\nused. No wine in all the tyme of sweatyng, excepte to suche whose\r\nsicknese require it for medicin, for fere of inflamynge & openynge,\r\nnor except y^e halfe be wel soden water. In other tymes old, pure &\r\nsmal. Wishing for the better execution hereof & ouersight of good and\r\nhelthsome victalles, ther wer appointed certein masters of helth in\r\neuery citie and toune, as there is in Italie, whiche for the good order\r\nin all thynges, maye be in al places an example. The meates I would to\r\nbe veale, muttone, kidde, olde lambe, chikyn, capone, henne, cocke,\r\npertriche, phesane, felfare, smal birdes, pigeon, yong pecockes, whose\r\nfleshe by a certeine natural & secrete propertie neuer putrefie, as\r\nhath bene proued. Conies, porke of meane age, neither fatte nor leane,\r\nthe skynne taken awaye, roste & eaten colde. Tartes of prunes, gelies\r\nof veale & capone. Yong befe in this case a little poudered is not to\r\nbe dispraised, nor new egges & good milke. Butter in a mornyng with\r\nsage and rewe fastynge in the sweatynge time is a good preseruatiue,\r\nbeside that it nourisheth. Crabbes, crauesses, picrel, perche ruffe,\r\ngogion, lampreis out of grauelly riuers, smeltes, dace, barbell,\r\ngornerd, whityng, soles, flunders, plaice, millers thumbes, minues w^h\r\nsuch others, sodde in water & vinegre w^h rosemary, time, sage, & hole\r\nmaces, & serued hote. Yea swete salte fishe & linge, for the saltes\r\nsake wastynge y^e humores therof, which in many freshe fishes remaine,\r\nmaye be allowed well watered to them that haue non other & wel lyke it.\r\nNor all fishes, no more then al fleshes be so euill as they be taken\r\nfor: as is wel declared in physik, & approued by the olde and wise\r\nromaines moche in their fisshes, lusty chartusianes neuer in fleshes,\r\n& helthful poore people more in fishe than fleshe. But we are nowe a\r\ndaies so vnwisely fine, and womanly delicate, that we may in no wise\r\ntouch a fisshe. The olde manly hardnes, stoute courage, and peinfulnes\r\nof Englande is vtterly driuen awaye, in the stede wherof, men now a\r\ndaies receiue womanlines & become nice, not able to withstande a blaste\r\nof wynde, or resiste a poore fisshe. And children be so brought up,\r\nthat if they be not all daie by the fire with a toste and butire, and\r\nin their furres, they be streight sicke.\r\n\r\nSauces to metes I appoint firste aboue all thynges good appetite,\r\nand next Oliues, capers, juse of lemones, Barberies, Pomegranetes,\r\nOrenges and Sorel, veriuse & vineigre, iuse of unripe Grapes, thepes\r\nor Goseberies. After mete, quinces, or marmalade, Pomgranates, Orenges\r\nsliced eaten with Suger, Succate of the pilles or barkes therof, and of\r\npomecitres, olde apples and peres, Brunes, Reisons Dates and Nuttes.\r\nFigges also, so they be taken before diner, els no frutes of that yere,\r\nnor rawe herbes or rotes in sallattes, for that in suche times they be\r\nsuspected to be partakers also of the enfected aire. (Fol. 21 to 24.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI remytte you to the discretion of a learned manne in phisike, who maye\r\njudge what is to be done, & how, according to the present estate of\r\nyoure bodies, nature, custome, & proprety, age, strength, delyghte &\r\nqualitie, tyme of the yeare, with other circumstaunces, & thereafter to\r\ngeue the quantitie, & make diuersitie of hys medicine. Otherwise loke\r\nnot to receiue by this boke that good which I entend, but that euel\r\nwhich by your owne foly you vndiscretelye bring. For good counseil may\r\nbe abused. And for me to write of euery particular estate and case,\r\nwhiche be so manye as there be menne, were so great almost a busines,\r\nas to numbre the sandes in the sea. Therefore seke you out a good\r\nPhisicien and knowen to haue skille, and at the leaste be so good to\r\nyour bodies, as you are to your hosen or shoes, for the wel making or\r\nmending wherof, I doubte not but you wil diligently searche out who\r\nis knowen to be the best hosier or shoemaker in the place where you\r\ndwelle: and flie the vnlearned as a pestilence in a comune wealth.\r\nAs simple women, carpenters, pewterers, brasiers, sopeballesellers,\r\npulters, hostellers, painters, apotecaries (otherwise then for their\r\ndrogges.) auaunters themselues to come from Pole, Constantinople,\r\nItalie, Almaine, Spaine, Fraunce, Grece and Turkie, Jude, Egipt or\r\nJury: from y^e seruice of Emperoures, kinges & quienes, promising\r\nhelpe of al diseases, yea vncurable, with one or twoo drinckes, by\r\nwaters sixe monethes in continualle distillinge, by Aurum potabile,\r\nor quintessence, by drynckes of great and hygh prices, as though thei\r\nwere made of the sunne, moone, or sterres, by blessynges and Blowinges,\r\nHipocriticalle prayenges, and foolysh smokynges of shirtes Smockes\r\nand kerchieffes, wyth suche others theire phantasies, and mockeryes,\r\nmeaninge nothinge els but to abuse your light belieue, and scorne you\r\nbehind your backes with their medicines (so filthie, that I am ashamed\r\nto name them) for your single wit and simple belief, in trusting them\r\nmost, whiche you know not at al, and understand least: like to them\r\nwhiche thinke, farre foules haue faire fethers, althoughe thei be neuer\r\nso euel fauoured & foule: as thoughe there coulde not be so conning an\r\nEnglishman, as a foolish running stranger, (of others I speake not)\r\nor so perfect helth by honest learning, as by deceiptfull ignorance.\r\nFor in the erroure of these vnlearned reasteth the losse of youre\r\nhonest estimation, diere bloudde, precious spirites, and swiete lyfe,\r\nthe thyng of most estimation and price in this worlde, next vnto the\r\nimmortal soule.\r\n\r\nFor consuming of euel matter within, and for making our bodies lustye,\r\ngaliard, & helthful, I do not a litle commende exercise, whiche in vs\r\nEnglishe men I allowe quick, and liuishe: as to runne after houndes\r\nand haukes, to shote, wrastle, play at Tennes and weapons, tosse the\r\nwinde balle, skirmishe at base (an exercise for a gentlemanne, muche\r\nvsed among the Italianes) and vaughting vpon an horse. Bowling, a good\r\nexercise for women: castinge of the barre and camping, I accompt rather\r\na laming of legges, then an exercise. Yet I vtterly reproue theim not,\r\nif the hurt may be auoyded. For these a conueniente tyme is, before\r\nmeate: due measure, reasonable sweatinge, in al times of the year,\r\nsauing in the sweatinge tyme. In the whiche I allow rather quietnesse\r\nthen exercise, for opening the body, in suche persons specially as be\r\nliberally & freely brought up. Others, except sitting artificers, haue\r\ntheire exercises by daily labours in their occupations, to whom nothing\r\nniedeth but solace onely, a thing conuenient for euery bodye that\r\nlusteth to live in helth. For els as non other thing, so not healthe\r\ncanne be longe durable.\r\n\r\nThus I speake of solace, that I meane not Idlenesse, wisshing alwayes\r\nno man to be idle, but to be occupied in some honest kinde of thing\r\nnecessary in a common welth. For I accompt them not worthie meate and\r\ndrink in a commonwelth, y^t be not good for some purpose or seruice\r\ntherin, but take them rather as burdennes vnprofitable and heauye to\r\nthe yearth, men borne to fille a numbre only, and wast the frutes which\r\ntherthe doeth geue, willing soner to fiede the Lacedemonians old &\r\ncroked asse, whiche labored for the liuing so long as it coulde for\r\nage, then suche an idle Englisshe manne. If the honestye and profite\r\nof honeste labour and exercise, conseruation of healthe, preseruation\r\nfrom sickenesse, maintenaunce of lyfe, advauncement, safety from\r\nshamefull deathes, defence from beggerye, dyspleasures by idlenesse,\r\nshamefulle diseases by the same, hatefulle vices, and punishmente\r\nof the immortalle soule canne not moue vs to reasonable laboure and\r\nexercise, and to be profitable membres of the commune welthe, let at\r\nthe least shame moue vs, seyng that other country menne, of nought, by\r\ntheir owne witte, diligence, labour and actiuitie, can picke oute of\r\na cast bone, a wrethen strawe, a lyghte fether, or an hard stone, an\r\nhoneste lyuinge: Nor ye shall euer heare theym say, alas master, I haue\r\nnon occupacion, I must either begge or steale. For they can finde other\r\nmeanes betwene these two. And for so muche as in the case that nowe is,\r\nmiserable persons are to be relieued in a common welth, I would wisshe\r\nfor not fauouring the idle, the discretion of Marc. Cicero the romaine\r\nwere vsed in healping them: who wolde compassion should be shewed vpon\r\nthem whome necessitie compelled to do or make a faute: & no compassion\r\nvpon them, in whome a faulte made necessitie. A faulte maketh\r\nnecessitie, in this case of begging, in them, whyche might laboure and\r\nserve & wil not for idlenes; and therefore not to be pitied, but rather\r\nto be punished. Necessitie maketh a fault in them, whiche wold labor\r\nand serue, but cannot for age, impotency, or sickenes, and therefore\r\nto be pitied and relieued. But to auoyde punishmente and to shew the\r\nwaye to amendmente, I woulde again wishe, y^t for so much as we be so\r\neuel disposed of ourselfes to our own profites and comodities without\r\nhelp, this old law were renued, which forbiddeth the nedy & impotent\r\nparentes, to be releued of those their welthi chyldren, that by theym\r\nor theire meanes were not broughte vppe, eyther in good learning and\r\nScience, or honeste occupation. For so is a man withoute science, as a\r\nrealme withoute a kyng. (Fol. 27 to 30.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAl these thinges duely obserued, and well executed, whiche before I\r\nhaue for preseruation mencioned, if more ouer we can sette aparte al\r\naffections, as fretting cares and thoughtes, dolefull or sorowfull\r\nimaginations, vaine feares, folysh loues, gnawing hates, and geue oure\r\nselues to lyue quietly, frendlie & merily one with an outher, as men\r\nwere wont to do in the old world, when this Countrie was called merye\r\nEnglande, and euery man to medle in his own matters, thinking theim\r\nsufficient, as thei do in Italie, and auoyde malyce and dissencion, the\r\ndestruction of commune wealthes, and priuate houses: I doubte not but\r\nwe shall preserue our selues, both from this sweatinge syckenesse, and\r\nother diseases also not here purposed to be spoken of.
