S., V. M. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the examination of a sick horse it is important to have a method or\r\nsystem. If a definite plan of examination is followed one may feel\r\nreasonably sure, when the examination is finished, that no important\r\npoint has been overlooked and that the examiner is in a position to\r\narrive at an opinion that is as accurate as is possible for him. Of\r\ncourse, an experienced eye can see, and a trained hand can feel, slight\r\nalterations or variations from the normal that are not perceptible to\r\nthe unskilled observer. A thorough knowledge of the conditions that\r\nexist in health is of the highest importance, because it is only by a\r\nknowledge of what is right that one can surely detect a wrong condition.\r\nA knowledge of anatomy, or of the structure of the body, and of\r\nphysiology, or the functions and activities of the body, lie at the\r\nbottom of accuracy of diagnosis. It is important to remember that\r\nanimals of different races or families deport themselves differently\r\nunder the influence of the same disease or pathological process. The\r\nsensitive and highly organized thoroughbred resists cerebral depression\r\nmore than does the lymphatic draft horse. Hence a degree of fever that\r\ndoes not produce marked dullness in a thoroughbred may cause the most\r\nabject dejection in a coarsely bred, heavy draft horse. This and similar\r\nfacts are of vast importance in the diagnosis of disease and in the\r\nrecognition of its significance.\r\n\r\nThe order of examination, as given hereafter, is one that has proved to\r\nbe comparatively easy of application and sufficiently thorough for the\r\npurpose of the readers of this work, and is recommended by several\r\nwriters.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY.\r\n\r\nIt is important to know, first of all, something of the origin and\r\ndevelopment of the disease; therefore the cause should be looked for.\r\nThe cause of a disease is important, not only in connection with\r\ndiagnosis, but also in connection with treatment. The character of feed\r\nthat the horse has had, the use to which he has been put, and the kind\r\nof care he has received should all be closely inquired into. It may be\r\nfound by this investigation that the horse has been fed on damaged feed,\r\nsuch as brewers' grains or moldy silage, and this may be sufficient to\r\nexplain the profound depression and weakness that are characteristic of\r\nforage poisoning. If it is learned that the horse has been kept in the\r\nstable without exercise for several days and upon full rations, and that\r\nhe became suddenly lame in his back and hind legs, and finally fell to\r\nthe ground from what appeared to be partial paralysis, this knowledge,\r\ntaken in connection with a few evident symptoms, will be enough to\r\nestablish a diagnosis of azoturia (excess of nitrogen in the urine). If\r\nit is learned that the horse has been recently shipped in the cars or\r\nhas been through a dealer's stable, we have knowledge of significance in\r\nconnection with the causation of a possible febrile disease, which is,\r\nunder these conditions, likely to prove to be influenza, or edematous\r\npneumonia.\r\n\r\nIt is also important to know whether the particular horse under\r\nexamination is the only one in the stable, or on the premises, that is\r\nsimilarly afflicted. If it is found that several horses are afflicted\r\nmuch in the same way, we have evidence of a common cause of disease\r\nwhich may prove to be of an infectious nature.\r\n\r\nAnother item of importance in connection with the history of the case\r\nrelates to the treatment that the horse may have had before he is\r\nexamined. It sometimes happens that medicine given in excessive\r\nquantities produces symptoms resembling those of disease, so it is\r\nimportant that the examiner be fully informed as to the medication that\r\nhas been employed.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTITUDE AND GENERAL CONDITION.\r\n\r\nBefore beginning the special examination, attention should be paid to\r\nthe attitude and general condition of the animal. Sometimes horses\r\nassume positions that are characteristic of a certain disease. For\r\nexample, in tetanus (lockjaw) the muscles of the face, neck, and\r\nshoulders are stiff and rigid, as well as the muscles of the jaw. This\r\ncondition produces a peculiar attitude, that once seen is subsequently\r\nrecognized as rather characteristic of the disease. A horse with tetanus\r\nstands with his muscles tense and his legs in a somewhat bracing\r\nposition, as though he were gathered to repel a shock. The neck is stiff\r\nand hard, the head is slightly extended upon it, and the face is drawn,\r\nand the nostrils are dilated. The tail is usually held up a little, and\r\nwhen pressed down against the thighs it springs back to its previous\r\nposition. In inflammation of the throat, as in pharyngolaryngitis, the\r\nhead is extended upon the neck and the angle between the jaw and the\r\nlower border of the neck is opened as far as possible to relieve the\r\npressure that otherwise would fall upon the throat. In dumminess, or\r\nimmobility, the hanging position of the head and the stupid expression\r\nare rather characteristic. In pleurisy, peritonitis, and some other\r\npainful diseases of the internal organs, the rigid position of the body\r\ndenotes an effort of the animal to avoid pressure upon and to protect\r\nthe inflamed sensitive region.\r\n\r\nThe horse may be down in the stall and unable to rise. This condition\r\nmay result from paraplegia (paralysis), from azoturia, from forage\r\npoisoning, from tetanus, or from painful conditions of the bones or\r\nfeet, such as osteoporosis or founder. Lying down at unusual times or in\r\nunusual positions may indicate disease. The first symptom of colic may\r\nbe a desire on the part of the horse to lie down at an unusual or\r\ninappropriate time or place. Sometimes disinclination to lie down is an\r\nindication of disease. When there is difficulty in breathing, the horse\r\nknows that he can manage himself better upon his feet than upon his\r\nbreast or his side. It happens, therefore, that in nearly all serious\r\ndiseases of the respiratory tract he stands persistently, day and night,\r\nuntil recovery has commenced and breathing is easier, or until the\r\nanimal falls from sheer exhaustion. If there is stiffness and soreness\r\nof the muscles, as in rheumatism, inflammation of the muscles from\r\noverwork, or of the bones in osteoporosis, or of the feet in founder, or\r\nif the muscles are stiff and beyond control of the animal, as in\r\ntetanus, a standing position is maintained, because the horse seems to\r\nrealize that when he lies down he will be unable to rise.\r\n\r\nAbnormal attitudes are assumed in painful diseases of the digestive\r\norgans (colic). A horse with colic may sit upon his haunches, like a\r\ndog, or may stand upon his hind feet and rest upon his knees in front,\r\nor he may endeavor to balance himself upon his back, with all four feet\r\nin the air. These positions are assumed because they give relief from\r\npain by lessening pressure or tension upon the sensitive structures.\r\n\r\nUnder the general condition of the animal it is necessary to observe the\r\ncondition or state of nutrition, the conformation, so far as it may\r\nindicate the constitution, and the temperament. By observing the\r\ncondition of nutrition one may be able to determine to a certain extent\r\nthe effect that the disease has already had upon the animal and to\r\nestimate the amount of strength that remains and that will be available\r\nfor the repair of the diseased tissues. A good condition of nutrition is\r\nshown by the rotundity of the body, the pliability and softness of the\r\nskin, and the tone of the hair. If the subcutaneous fat has disappeared\r\nand the muscles are wasted, allowing the bony prominences to stand out;\r\nif the skin is tight and inelastic and the coat dry and harsh, we have\r\nevidence of a low state of nutrition. This may have resulted from a\r\nsevere and long-continued disease or from lack of proper feed and care.\r\nWhen an animal is emaciated--that is, becomes thin--there is first a\r\nloss of fat and later the muscles shrink. By observing the amount of\r\nshrinkage in the muscles one has some indication as to the duration of\r\nthe unfavorable conditions under which the animal has lived.\r\n\r\nBy constitution we understand the innate ability of the animal to\r\nwithstand disease or unfavorable conditions of life. The constitution\r\ndepends largely upon the conformation. The type of construction that\r\nusually accompanies the best constitution is deep, broad chest, allowing\r\nplenty of room for the lungs and heart, indicating that these vital\r\norgans are well developed; capacious abdomen, allowing sufficient space\r\nfor well-developed organs of digestion; the loins should be short--that\r\nis, the space should be short between the last rib and the point of the\r\nhip; the head and neck should be well molded, without superfluous or\r\nuseless tissue; this gives a clear-cut throat. The ears, eyes, and face\r\nshould have an expression of alertness and good breeding. The muscular\r\ndevelopment should be good; the shoulders, forearms, croup, and thighs\r\nmust have the appearance of strength. The withers are sharp, which means\r\nthat they are not loaded with useless, superfluous tissue; the legs are\r\nstraight and their axes are parallel; the knees and hocks are low, which\r\nmeans that the forearms and thighs are long and the cannons relatively\r\nshort. The cannons are broad from in front to behind and relatively thin\r\nfrom side to side. This means that the bony and tendinous structures of\r\nthe legs are well developed and well placed. The hoofs are compact,\r\ntense, firm structures, and their soles are concave and frogs large.\r\nSuch a horse is likely to have a good constitution and to be able to\r\nresist hard work, fatigue, and disease to a maximum degree. On the other\r\nhand, a poor constitution is indicated by a shallow, narrow chest, small\r\nbones, long loins, coarse neck and head, with thick throat, small, bony,\r\nand muscular development, short thighs and forearms, small joints, long,\r\nround cannons, and hoofs of open texture with flat soles.\r\n\r\nThe temperament is indicated by the manner in which the horse responds\r\nto external stimuli. When the horse is spoken to, or when he sees or\r\nfeels anything that stimulates or gives alarm, if he responds actively,\r\nquickly, and intelligently, he is said to be of lively, or nervous,\r\ntemperament. On the other hand, if he responds in a slow, sluggish\r\nmanner, he is said to have a sluggish, or lymphatic, temperament. The\r\ntemperament is indicated by the gait, by the expression of the face, and\r\nby the carriage of the head and ears. The nature of the temperament\r\nshould be taken into consideration in an endeavor to ascertain the\r\nseverity of a given case of illness, because the general expression of\r\nan animal in disease as well as in health depends to a large extent on\r\nthe temperament.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SKIN AND THE VISIBLE MUCOUS MEMBRANES.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the skin is a fair index to the condition of the\r\nanimal. The effect of disease and emaciation upon the pliability of the\r\nskin have been referred to above. There is no part of the body that\r\nloses its elasticity and tone as a result of disease sooner than the\r\nskin. The practical herdsman or flockmaster can gain a great deal of\r\ninformation as to the condition, of an animal merely by grasping the\r\ncoat and looking at and feeling the skin. Similarly, the condition of\r\nthe animal is shown to a certain extent by the appearance of the mucous\r\nmembranes. For example, when the horse is anemic as a result of disease\r\nor of inappropriate feed the mucous membranes become pale. This change\r\nin the mucous membranes can be seen most readily in the lining of the\r\neyelids and in the lining of the nostril. For convenience of examination\r\nthe eyelids can readily be everted. Paleness means weak circulation or\r\npoor blood. Increased redness occurs physiologically in painful\r\nconditions, excitement, and following severe exertion. Under such\r\nconditions the increase of circulation is transitory. In fevers there is\r\nan increased redness in the mucous membrane, and this continues so long\r\nas the fever lasts. In some diseases red spots or streaks form in the\r\nmucous membrane. This usually indicates an infectious disease of\r\nconsiderable severity, and occurs in blood poisoning, purpura\r\nhemorrhagica, hemorrhagic septicemia, and in urticaria. When the liver\r\nis deranged and does not operate, or when the red-blood corpuscles are\r\nbroken down, as in serious cases of influenza, there is a yellowish\r\ndiscoloration of the mucous membrane. The mucous membranes become bluish\r\nor blue when the blood is imperfectly oxidized and contains an excess of\r\ncarbon dioxid. This condition exists in any serious disease of the\r\nrespiratory tract, as pneumonia, and in heart failure.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the skin varies with the temperature of the body. If\r\nthere is fever the temperature of the skin is likely to be increased.\r\nSometimes, however, as a result of poor circulation and irregular\r\ndistribution of the blood, the body may be warmer than normal, while the\r\nextremities (the legs and ears) may be cold. Where the general surface\r\nof the body becomes cold it is evident that the small blood vessels in\r\nthe skin have contracted and are keeping the blood away, as during a\r\nchill, or that the heart is weak and is unable to pump the blood to the\r\nsurface, and that the animal is on the verge of collapse.\r\n\r\nThe skin is moist, to a certain degree, at all times in a healthy horse.\r\nThis moisture is not in the form of a perceptible sweat, but it is\r\nenough to keep the skin pliable and to cause the hair to have a soft,\r\nhealthy feel. In some chronic diseased conditions and in fever, the skin\r\nbecomes dry. In this case the hair has a harsh feel that is quite\r\ndifferent from the condition observed in health, and from the fact of\r\nits being so dry the individual hairs do not adhere to one another, they\r\nstand apart, and the animal has what is known as \"a staring coat.\" When,\r\nduring a fever, sweating occurs, it is usually an indication that the\r\ncrisis is passed. Sometimes sweating is an indication of pain. A horse\r\nwith tetanus or azoturia sweats profusely. Horses sweat freely when\r\nthere is a serious impediment to respiration; they sweat under\r\nexcitement, and, of course, from the well-known physiological causes of\r\nheat and work. Local sweating, or sweating of a restricted area of the\r\nbody, denotes some kind of nerve interference.\r\n\r\nSwellings of the skin usually come from wounds or other external causes\r\nand have no special connection with the diagnosis of internal diseases.\r\nThere are, however, a number of conditions in which the swelling of the\r\nskin is a symptom of a derangement of some other part of the body. For\r\nexample, there is the well-known \"stocking,\" or swelling of the legs\r\nabout the fetlock joints, in influenza. There is the soft swelling of\r\nthe hind legs that occurs so often in draft horses when standing still\r\nand that comes from previous inflammation (lymphangitis) or from\r\ninsufficient heart power. Dropsy, or edema of the skin, may occur\r\nbeneath the chest or abdomen from heart insufficiency or from chronic\r\ncollection of fluid in the chest or abdomen (hydrothorax, ascites, or\r\nanemia). In anasarca or purpura hemorrhagica large soft swellings appear\r\non any part of the skin, but usually on the legs, side of the body, and\r\nabout the head.\r\n\r\nGas collects under the skin in some instances. This comes from a local\r\ninoculation with an organism which produces a fermentation beneath the\r\nskin and causes the liberation of gas which inflates the skin, or the\r\ngas may be air that enters through a wound penetrating some\r\nair-containing organ, as the lungs. The condition here described is\r\nknown as emphysema. Emphysema may follow the fracture of a rib when the\r\nend of a bone is forced inward and caused to penetrate the lung, or it\r\nmay occur when, as a result of an ulcerating process, an organ\r\ncontaining air is perforated. This accident is more common in cattle\r\nthan it is in horses. Emphysema is recognized by the fact that the\r\nswelling that it causes is not hot or sensitive on pressure. It emits a\r\npeculiar crackling sound when it is stroked or pressed upon.\r\n\r\nWounds of the skin may be of importance in the diagnosis of internal\r\ndisease. Wounds over the bony prominence, as the point of the hip, the\r\npoint of the shoulder, and the greatest convexity of the ribs, occur\r\nwhen a horse is unable to stand for a long time and, through continually\r\nlying upon his side, has shut off the circulation to the portion of the\r\nskin that covers parts of the body that carry the greatest weight, and\r\nin this way has caused them to mortify. Little, round, soft, doughlike\r\nswellings occur on the skin and may be scattered freely over the surface\r\nof the body when the horse is afflicted with urticaria. Similar\r\neruptions, but distributed less generally, about the size of a silver\r\ndollar, may occur as a symptom of dourine, or colt distemper. Hard\r\nlumps, from which radiate welt-like swellings of the lymphatics, occur\r\nin glanders, and blisterlike eruptions occur around the mouth and\r\npasterns in horsepox.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORGANS OF CIRCULATION.\r\n\r\nThe first item in this portion of the examination consists in taking the\r\npulse. The pulse may be counted and its character may be determined at\r\nany point where a large artery occupies a situation close to the skin\r\nand above a hard tissue, such as a bone, cartilage, or tendon. The most\r\nconvenient place for taking the pulse of the horse is at the jaw. The\r\nexternal maxillary artery runs from between the jaws, around the lower\r\nborder of the jawbone, and up on the outside of the jawbone to the face.\r\nIt is located immediately in front of the heavy muscles of the cheek.\r\nIts throb can be felt most distinctly just before it turns around the\r\nlower border of the jawbone. The balls of the first and second or of the\r\nsecond and third fingers should be pressed lightly on the skin over this\r\nartery when its pulsations are to be studied.\r\n\r\nThe normal pulse of the healthy horse varies in frequency as follows:\r\n\r\n    Stallion                     28 to 32 beats per minute.\r\n\r\n    Gelding                      33 to 38 beats per minute.\r\n\r\n    Mare                         34 to 40 beats per minute.\r\n\r\n    Foal 2 to 3 years old        40 to 50 beats per minute.\r\n\r\n    Foal 6 to 12 months old      45 to 60 beats per minute.\r\n\r\n    Foal 2 to 4 weeks old        70 to 90 beats per minute.\r\n\r\nThe pulse is accelerated by the digestion of rich food, by hot weather,\r\nexercise, excitement, and alarm. It is slightly more rapid in the\r\nevening than it is in the morning. Well-bred horses have a slightly more\r\nrapid pulse than sluggish, cold-blooded horses. The pulse should be\r\nregular; that is, the separate beats should follow each other after\r\nintervals of equal length, and the beats should be of equal fullness, or\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\nIn disease, the pulse may become slower or more rapid than in health.\r\nSlowing of the pulse may be caused by old age, great exhaustion, or\r\nexcessive cold. It may be due to depression of the central nervous\r\nsystem, as in dumminess, or be the result of the administration of\r\ndrugs, such as digitalis or strophantus. A rapid pulse is almost always\r\nfound in fever, and the more severe the infection and the weaker the\r\nheart the more rapid is the pulse. Under these conditions, the beats may\r\nrise to 80, 90, or even 120 per minute. When the pulse is above 100 per\r\nminute the outlook for recovery is not promising, and especially if this\r\nsymptom accompanies high temperature or occurs late in an infectious\r\ndisease. In nearly all of the diseases of the heart and in anemia the\r\npulse becomes rapid.\r\n\r\nThe pulse is irregular in diseases of the heart, and especially where\r\nthe valves are affected. The irregularity may consist in varying\r\nintervals between the beats or the dropping of one or more beats at\r\nregular or irregular intervals. The latter condition sometimes occurs in\r\nchronic diseases of the brain. The pulse is said to be weak, or soft,\r\nwhen the beats are indistinct, because little blood is forced through\r\nthe artery by each contraction of the heart. This condition occurs when\r\nthere is a constriction of the vessels leading from the heart and it\r\noccurs in certain infectious and febrile diseases, and is an indication\r\nof heart weakness.\r\n\r\nIn examining the heart itself it is necessary to recall that it lies in\r\nthe anterior portion of the chest slightly to the left of the median\r\nline and that it extends from the third to the sixth rib. It extends\r\nalmost to the breastbone, and a little more than half of the distance\r\nbetween the breastbone and the backbone. In contracting, it rotates\r\nslightly on its axis, so that the point of the heart, which lies below,\r\nis pressed against the left chest wall at a place immediately above the\r\npoint of the elbow. The heart has in it four chambers--two in the left\r\nand two in the right side. The upper chamber of the left side (left\r\nauricle) receives the blood as it comes from the lungs, passes it to the\r\nlower chamber of the left side (left ventricle), and from here it is\r\nsent with great force (for this chamber has very strong, thick walls)\r\nthrough the aorta and its branches (the arteries) to all parts of the\r\nbody. The blood returns through the veins to the upper chamber of the\r\nright side (right auricle), passes then to the lower chamber of the\r\nright side (right ventricle), and from this chamber is forced into the\r\nlungs to be oxidized. The openings between the chambers of each side and\r\ninto the aorta are guarded by valves.\r\n\r\nIf the horse is not too fat, one may feel the impact of the apex of the\r\nheart against the chest wall with each contraction of the heart by\r\nplacing the hand on the left side back of the fifth rib and above the\r\npoint of the elbow. The thinner and the better bred the horse is the\r\nmore distinctly this impact is felt. If the animal is excited, or if he\r\nhas just been exercised, the impact is stronger than when the horse is\r\nat rest. If the horse is weak, the impact is reduced in force.\r\n\r\nThe examination of the heart with the ear is an important matter in this\r\nconnection. Certain sounds are produced by each contraction of the\r\nnormal heart. It is customary to divide these into two, and to call them\r\nthe first and second sounds. These two sounds are heard during each\r\npulsation, and any deviation of the normal indicates some alteration in\r\nthe structure or the functions of the heart. In making this examination,\r\none may apply the left ear over the heavy muscles of the shoulder back\r\nof the shoulder joint, and just above the point of the elbow, or, if the\r\nsounds are not heard distinctly, the left fore leg may be drawn forward\r\nby an assistant and the right ear placed against the lower portion of\r\nthe chest wall that is exposed in this manner.\r\n\r\nThe first sound of the heart occurs while the heart muscle is\r\ncontracting and while the blood is being forced from the heart and the\r\nvalves are rendered taut to prevent the return of the blood from the\r\nlower to the upper chambers. The second sound follows quickly after the\r\nfirst and occurs during rebound of blood in the arteries, causing\r\npressure in the aorta and tensions of the valves guarding its opening\r\ninto the left ventricle. The first sound is of a high pitch and is\r\nlonger and more distinct than the second. Under the influence of disease\r\nthese sounds may be altered in various ways. It is not profitable, in a\r\nwork such as this, to describe the details of these alterations. Those\r\nwho are interested will find this subject fully discussed in the\r\nveterinary textbooks.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the horse is determined roughly by placing the\r\nfingers in the mouth or between the thighs or by allowing the horse to\r\nexhale against the cheek or back of the hand. In accurate examination,\r\nhowever, these means of determining temperature are not relied upon, but\r\nrecourse is had to the use of the thermometer. The thermometer used for\r\ntaking the temperature of a horse is a self-registering clinical\r\nthermometer, similar to that used by physicians, but larger, being from\r\n5 to 6 inches long. The temperature of the animal is measured in the\r\nrectum.\r\n\r\nThe normal temperature of the horse varies somewhat under different\r\nconditions. It is higher in the young animal than in the old, and is\r\nhigher in hot weather than in cold. The weather and exercise decidedly\r\ninfluence the temperature physiologically. The normal temperature varies\r\nfrom 99.5 deg. to 101 deg. F. If the temperature rises to 102.5 deg. the horse is\r\nsaid to have a low fever; if the temperature reaches 104 deg. the fever is\r\nmoderate; if it reaches 106 deg. it is high, and above this point it is\r\nregarded as very high. In some diseases, such as tetanus or sunstroke,\r\nthe temperature goes as high as 108 deg. or 110 deg.. In the ordinary infectious\r\ndiseases it does not often exceed 106 deg.. A temperature of 107.5 deg. and\r\nabove is very dangerous and must be reduced promptly if the horse is to\r\nbe saved.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORGANS OF RESPIRATION.\r\n\r\nIn examining this system of organs and their functions it is customary\r\nto begin by noting the frequency of the respiratory movements. This\r\npoint can be determined by observing the motions of the nostrils or of\r\nthe flanks; on a cold day one can see the condensation of the moisture\r\nof the warm air as it comes from the lungs. The normal rate of\r\nrespiration for a healthy horse at rest is from 8 to 16 per minute. The\r\nrate is faster in young animals than in old, and is increased by work,\r\nhot weather, overfilling of the stomach, pregnancy, lying upon the side,\r\netc. Acceleration of the respiratory rate where no physiological cause\r\noperates is due to a variety of conditions. Among these is fever;\r\nrestricted area of active lung tissue, from filling of portions of the\r\nlungs with inflammatory exudate, as in pneumonia; compression of the\r\nlungs or loss of elasticity; pain in the muscles controlling the\r\nrespiratory movements; excess of carbon dioxid in the blood; and\r\nconstriction of the air passages leading to the lungs.\r\n\r\nDifficult or labored respiration is known as dyspnea. It occurs when it\r\nis difficult, for any reason, for the animal to obtain the amount of\r\noxygen that it requires. This may be due to filling of the lungs, as in\r\npneumonia; to painful movements of the chest, as in rheumatism or\r\npleurisy; to tumors of the nose and paralysis of the throat, swellings\r\nof the throat, foreign bodies, or weakness of the respiratory passages,\r\nfluid in the chest cavity, adhesions between the lungs and chest walls,\r\nloss of elasticity of the lungs, etc. Where the difficulty is great the\r\naccessory muscles of respiration are brought into play. In great dyspnea\r\nthe horse stands with his front feet apart, with his neck straight out,\r\nand his head extended upon his neck. The nostrils are widely dilated,\r\nthe face has an anxious expression, the eyeballs protrude, the\r\nup-and-down motion of the larynx is aggravated, the amplitude of the\r\nmovement of the chest walls increased, and the flanks heave.\r\n\r\nThe expired air is of about the temperature of the body. It contains\r\nconsiderable moisture, and it should come with equal force from each\r\nnostril and should not have an unpleasant odor. If the stream of air\r\nfrom one nostril is stronger than from the other, there is an indication\r\nof an obstruction in a nasal chamber. If the air possesses a bad odor,\r\nit is usually an indication of putrefaction of a tissue or secretion in\r\nsome part of the respiratory tract. A bad odor is found where there is\r\nnecrosis of the bone in the nasal passages or in chronic catarrh. An\r\nulcerating tumor of the nose or throat may cause the breath to have an\r\noffensive odor. The most offensive breath occurs where there is\r\nnecrosis, or gangrene, of the lungs.\r\n\r\nIn some diseases there is a discharge from the nose. In order to\r\ndetermine the significance of the discharge it should be examined\r\nclosely. One should ascertain whether it comes from one or both\r\nnostrils. If but from one nostril, it probably originates in the head.\r\nThe color should be noted. A thin, watery discharge may be composed of\r\nserum, and it occurs in the earlier stages of coryza, or nasal catarrh.\r\nAn opalescent, slightly tinted discharge is composed of mucus and\r\nindicates a little more severe irritation. If the discharge is sticky\r\nand puslike, a deeper difficulty or more advanced irritation is\r\nindicated. If the discharge contains flakes and clumps of more or less\r\ndried, agglutinated particles, it is probable that it originates within\r\na cavity of the head, as the sinuses or guttural pouches. The discharge\r\nof glanders is of a peculiar sticky nature and adheres tenaciously to\r\nthe wings of the nostrils. The discharge of pneumonia is of a somewhat\r\nred or reddish brown color and, on this account has been described as a\r\nprune-juice discharge. The discharge may contain blood. If the blood\r\nappears as clots or as streaks in the discharge, it probably originates\r\nat some point in the upper part of the respiratory tract. If the blood\r\nis in the form of a fine froth, it comes from the lungs.\r\n\r\nIn examining the interior of the nasal passage one should remember that\r\nthe normal color of the mucous membrane is a rosy pink and that its\r\nsurface is smooth. If ulcers, nodules, swellings, or tumors are found,\r\nthese indicate disease. The ulcer that is characteristic of glanders is\r\ndescribed fully in connection with the discussion of that disease.\r\n\r\nBetween the lower jaws there are several clusters of lymphatic glands.\r\nThese glands are so small and so soft that it is difficult to find them\r\nby feeling through the skin, but when a suppurative disease exists in\r\nthe upper part of the respiratory tract these glands become swollen and\r\neasy to feel. They may become soft and break down and discharge as\r\nabscesses; this is seen constantly in strangles. On the other hand, they\r\nmay become indurated and hard from the proliferation of connective\r\ntissue and attach themselves to the jawbone, to the tongue, or to the\r\nskin. This is seen in chronic glanders. If the glands are swollen and\r\ntender to pressure, it indicates that the disease causing the\r\nenlargement is acute; if they are hard and insensitive, the disease\r\ncausing the enlargement is chronic.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the horse coughs is of importance in diagnosis. The\r\ncough is a forced expiration, following immediately upon a forcible\r\nseparation of the vocal cords. The purpose of the cough is to remove\r\nsome irritant substance from the respiratory passages, and it occurs\r\nwhen irritant gases, such as smoke, ammonia, sulphur vapor, or dust,\r\nhave been inhaled. It occurs from inhalation of cold air if the\r\nrespiratory passages are sensitive from disease. In laryngitis,\r\nbronchitis, and pneumonia, cough is very easily excited and occurs\r\nmerely from accumulation of mucus and inflammatory product upon the\r\nirritated respiratory mucous membrane. If one wishes to determine the\r\ncharacter of the cough, it can easily be excited by pressing upon the\r\nlarynx with the thumb and finger. The larynx should be pressed from side\r\nto side and the pressure removed the moment the horse commences to\r\ncough. A painful cough occurs in pleurisy, also in laryngitis,\r\nbronchitis, and bronchial pneumonia. Pain is shown by the effort the\r\nanimal exerts to repress the cough. The cough is not painful, as a rule,\r\nin the chronic diseases of the respiratory tract. The force of the cough\r\nis considerable when it is not especially painful and when the lungs are\r\nnot seriously involved. When the lungs are so diseased that they can not\r\nbe filled with a large volume of air, and in heaves, the cough is weak,\r\nas it is also in weak, debilitated animals. If mucus or pus is coughed\r\nout, or if the cough is accompanied by a gurgling sound, it is said to\r\nbe moist; it is dry when these characteristics are not present--that is,\r\nwhen the air in passing out passes over surface not loaded with\r\nsecretion.\r\n\r\nIn the examination of the chest we resort to percussion and\r\nauscultation. When a cask or other structure containing air is tapped\r\nupon, or percussed, a hollow sound is given forth. If the cask contains\r\nfluid, the sound is of a dull and of quite a different character.\r\nSimilarly, the amount of air contained in the lungs can be estimated by\r\ntapping upon, or percussing, the walls of the chest. Percussion is\r\npracticed with the fingers alone or with the aid of a special percussion\r\nhammer and an object to strike upon known as a pleximeter. If the\r\nfingers are used, the middle finger of the left hand should be pressed\r\nfirmly against the side of the horse and should be struck with the ends\r\nof the fingers of the right hand bent at a right angle so as to form a\r\nhammer. The percussion hammer sold by instrument makers is made of\r\nrubber or has a rubber tip, so that when the pleximeter, which is placed\r\nagainst the side, is struck the impact will not be accompanied by a\r\nnoise. After experience in this method of examination one can determine\r\nwith a considerable degree of accuracy whether the lung contains a\r\nnormal amount of air or not. If, as in pneumonia, air has been displaced\r\nby inflammatory product occupying the air space, or if fluid collects in\r\nthe lower part of the chest, the percussion sound becomes dull. If, as\r\nin emphysema, or in pneumothorax, there is an excess of air in the\r\nchest cavity, the percussion sound becomes abnormally loud and clear.\r\n\r\nAuscultation consists in the examination of the lungs with the ear\r\napplied closely to the chest wall. As the air goes in and out of the\r\nlungs a certain soft sound is made which can be heard distinctly,\r\nespecially upon inspiration. This sound is intensified by anything that\r\naccelerates the rate of respiration, such as exercise. This soft,\r\nrustling sound is known as vesicular murmur, and wherever it is heard it\r\nsignifies that the lung contains air and is functionally active. The\r\nvesicular murmur is weakened when there is an inflammatory infiltration\r\nof the lung tissue or when the lungs are compressed by fluid in the\r\nchest cavity. The vesicular murmur disappears when air is excluded by\r\nthe accumulation, of inflammatory product, as in pneumonia, and when the\r\nlungs are compressed by fluid in the chest cavity. The vesicular murmur\r\nbecomes rough and harsh in the early stages of inflammation of the\r\nlungs, and this is often the first sign of the beginning of pneumonia.\r\n\r\nBy applying the ear over the lower part of the windpipe in front of the\r\nbreastbone a somewhat harsh, blowing sound may be heard. This is known\r\nas the bronchial murmur and is heard in normal conditions near the lower\r\npart of the trachea and to a limited extent in the anterior portions of\r\nthe lungs after sharp exercise. When the bronchial murmur is heard over\r\nother portions of the lungs, it may signify that the lungs are more or\r\nless solidified by disease and the blowing bronchial murmur is\r\ntransmitted through this solid lung to the ear from a distant part of\r\nthe chest. The bronchial murmur in an abnormal place signifies that\r\nthere exists pneumonia or that the lungs are compressed by fluid in the\r\nchest cavity.\r\n\r\nAdditional sounds are heard in the lungs in some diseased conditions.\r\nFor example, when fluid collects in the air passages and the air is\r\nforced through it or is caused to pass through tubes containing\r\nsecretions or pus. Such sounds are of a gurgling or bubbling nature and\r\nare known as mucous rales. Mucous rales are spoken of as being large or\r\nsmall as they are distinct or indistinct, depending upon the quantity of\r\nfluid that is present and the size of the tube in which this sound is\r\nproduced. Mucous rales occur in pneumonia after the solidified parts\r\nbegin to break down at the end of the disease. They occur in bronchitis\r\nand in tuberculosis, where there is an excess of secretion.\r\n\r\nSometimes a shrill sound is heard, like the note of a whistle, fife, or\r\nflute. This is due to a dry constriction of the bronchial tubes and it\r\nis heard in chronic bronchitis and in tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nA friction sound is heard in pleurisy. This is due to the rubbing\r\ntogether of roughened surfaces, and the sound produced is similar to a\r\ndry rubbing sound that is caused by rubbing the hands together or by\r\nrubbing upon each other two dry, rough pieces of leather.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EXAMINATION OF THE DIGESTIVE TRACT.\r\n\r\nThe first point in connection with the examination of the organs of\r\ndigestion is the appetite and the manner of taking food and drink. A\r\nhealthy animal has a good appetite. Loss of appetite does not point to a\r\nspecial diseased condition, but comes from a variety of causes. Some of\r\nthese causes, indeed, may be looked upon as being physiological.\r\nExcitement, strange surroundings, fatigue, and hot weather may all cause\r\nloss of appetite. Where there is cerebral depression, fever, profound\r\nweakness, disorder of the stomach, or mechanical difficulty in chewing\r\nor swallowing, the appetite is diminished or destroyed. Sometimes there\r\nis an appetite or desire to eat abnormal things, such as dirty bedding,\r\nroots of grass, soil, etc. This desire usually comes from a chronic\r\ndisturbance of nutrition.\r\n\r\nThirst is diminished in a good many mild diseases unaccompanied by\r\ndistinct fever. It is seen where there is great exhaustion or depression\r\nor profound brain disturbance. Thirst is increased after profuse\r\nsweating, in diabetes, diarrhea, in fever, at the crises of infectious\r\ndiseases, and when the mouth is dry and hot.\r\n\r\nSome diseases of the mouth or throat make it difficult for the horse to\r\nchew or swallow his feed. Where difficulty in this respect is\r\nexperienced, the following named conditions should be borne in mind and\r\ncarefully looked for: Diseases of the teeth, consisting in decay,\r\nfracture, abscess formation, or overgrowth; inflammatory conditions, or\r\nwounds or tumors of the tongue, cheeks, or lips; paralysis of the\r\nmuscles of chewing or swallowing; foreign bodies in upper part of the\r\nmouth between the molar teeth; inflammation of throat. Difficulty in\r\nswallowing is sometimes shown by the symptom known as \"quidding.\"\r\nQuidding consists in dropping from the mouth well-chewed and insalivated\r\nboluses of feed. A mouthful of hay, for example, after being ground and\r\nmasticated, is carried to the back part of the mouth. The horse then\r\nfinds that from tenderness of the throat, or from some other cause,\r\nswallowing is difficult or painful, and the bolus is then dropped from\r\nthe mouth. Another quantity of hay is similarly prepared, only to be\r\ndropped in turn. Sometimes quidding is due to a painful tooth, the bolus\r\nbeing dropped from the mouth when the tooth is struck and during the\r\npang that follows. Quidding may be practiced so persistently that a\r\nconsiderable pile of boluses of feed accumulate in the manger or on the\r\nfloor of the stall. In pharyngitis one of the symptoms is a return\r\nthrough the nose of fluid that the horse attempts to swallow.\r\n\r\nIn some brain diseases, and particularly in chronic internal\r\nhydrocephalus, the horse has a most peculiar manner of swallowing and of\r\ntaking feed. A similar condition is seen in hyperemia of the brain. In\r\neating the horse will sink his muzzle into the grain in the feed box\r\nand eat for a while without raising the head. Long pauses are made while\r\nthe feed is in the mouth. Sometimes the horse will eat very rapidly for\r\na little while and then slowly; the jaws may be brought together so\r\nforcibly that the teeth gnash. In eating hay the horse will stop at\r\ntimes with hay protruding from the mouth and stand stupidly, as though\r\nhe has forgotten what he was about.\r\n\r\nIn examining the mouth one should first look for swellings or for\r\nevidence of abnormal conditions upon the exterior; that is, the front\r\nand sides of the face, the jaws, and about the muzzle. By this means\r\nwounds, fractures, tumors, abscesses, and disease accompanied by\r\neruptions about the muzzle may be detected. The interior of the mouth is\r\nexamined by holding the head up and inserting the fingers through the\r\ninterdental space in such a way as to cause the mouth to open. The\r\nmucous membrane should be clean and of a light-pink color, excepting on\r\nthe back of the tongue, where the color is a yellowish gray. As\r\nabnormalities of this region, the chief are diffuse inflammation,\r\ncharacterized by redness and catarrhal discharge; local inflammation, as\r\nfrom eruptions, ulcers, or wounds; necrosis of the lower jawbone in\r\nfront of the first back tooth; and swellings. Foreign bodies are\r\nsometimes found embedded in the mucous membrane lining of the mouth or\r\nlodged between the teeth.\r\n\r\nThe examination of the pharynx and of the esophagus is made chiefly by\r\npressing upon the skin covering these organs in the region of the throat\r\nand along the left side of the neck in the jugular gutter. Sometimes,\r\nwhen a more careful examination is necessary, an esophageal tube or\r\nprobang is passed through the nose or mouth down the esophagus to the\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nVomiting is an act consisting in the expulsion of all or part of the\r\ncontents of the stomach through the mouth or nose. This act is more\r\ndifficult for the horse than for most of the other domestic animals,\r\nbecause the stomach of the horse is small and does not lie on the floor\r\nof the abdominal cavity, so that the abdominal walls in contracting do\r\nnot bring pressure to bear upon it so directly and forcibly, as is the\r\ncase in many other animals. Beside this, there is a loose fold of mucous\r\nmembrane at the point where the esophagus enters the stomach, and this\r\nforms a sort of valve which does not interfere with the passage of food\r\ninto the stomach, but does interfere with the exit of food through the\r\nesophageal opening. Still, vomiting is a symptom that is occasionally\r\nseen in the horse. It occurs when the stomach is very much distended\r\nwith food or with gas. Distention stretches the mucous membrane and\r\neradicates the valvular fold referred to, and also makes it possible for\r\nmore pressure to be exerted upon the stomach through the contraction of\r\nthe abdominal muscles. Since the distention to permit vomiting must be\r\nextreme, it not infrequently happens that it leads to rupture of the\r\nstomach walls. This has caused the impression in the minds of some that\r\nvomiting can not occur in the horse without rupture of the stomach, but\r\nthis is incorrect, since many horses vomit and afterwards become\r\nentirely sound. After rupture of the stomach has occurred vomiting is\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nIn examination of the abdomen one should remember that its size depends\r\nlargely upon the breed, sex, and conformation of the animal, and also\r\nupon the manner in which the animal has been fed and the use to which it\r\nhas been put. A pendulous abdomen may be the result of an abdominal\r\ntumor or of an accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity; or, on the\r\nother hand, it may merely be an indication of pregnancy, or of the fact\r\nthat the horse has been fed for a long time on bulky and innutritious\r\nfood. Pendulous abdomen occurring in a work horse kept on a concentrated\r\ndiet is an abnormal condition. The abdomen may increase suddenly in\r\nvolume from accumulation of gas in tympanic colic. The abdomen becomes\r\nsmall and the horse is said to be \"tucked up\" from long-continued poor\r\nappetite, as in diseases of the digestive tract and in fever. This\r\ncondition also occurs in tetanus from the contraction of the abdominal\r\nwalls and in diarrhea from emptiness.\r\n\r\nIn applying the ear to the flank, on either the right or left side,\r\ncertain bubbling sounds may be heard that are known as peristaltic\r\nsounds, because they are produced by peristalsis, or wormlike\r\ncontraction of the intestines. These sounds are a little louder on the\r\nright side than on the left on account of the fact that the large\r\nintestines lie in the right flank. Absence of peristaltic sounds is\r\nalways an indication of disease, and suggests exhaustion or paralysis of\r\nthe intestines. This may occur in certain kinds of colic and is an\r\nunfavorable symptom. Increased sounds are heard where the intestines are\r\ncontracted more violently than in health, as in spasmodic colic, and\r\nalso where there is an excess of fluid or gas in the intestinal canal.\r\n\r\nThe feces show, to a certain extent, the thoroughness of digestion. They\r\nshould show that the feed has been well ground, and should, in the\r\nhorse, be free from offensive odor or coatings of mucus. A coating of\r\nmucus shows intestinal catarrh. Blood on the feces indicates severe\r\ninflammation. Very light color and bad odor may come from inactive\r\nliver. Parasites are sometimes in the dung.\r\n\r\nRectal examination consists in examination of the organs of the pelvic\r\ncavity and posterior portion of the abdominal cavity by the hand\r\ninserted into the rectum. This examination should be attempted by a\r\nveterinarian only, and is useless except to one who has a good knowledge\r\nof the anatomy of the parts concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EXAMINATION OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nThe great brain, or cerebrum, is the seat of intelligence, and it\r\ncontains the centers that control motion in many parts of the body. The\r\nfront portion of the brain is believed to be the region that is most\r\nimportant in governing the intelligence. The central and posterior\r\nportions of the cerebrum contain the centers for the voluntary motions\r\nof the face and of the front and hind legs. The growth of a tumor or an\r\ninflammatory change in the region of a center governing the motion of a\r\ncertain part of the body has the effect of disturbing motion in that\r\npart by causing excessive contraction known as cramps, or inability of\r\nthe muscles to contract, constituting the condition known as paralysis.\r\nThe nerve paths from the cerebrum, and hence from these centers to the\r\nspinal cord and thence to the muscles, pass beneath the small brain, or\r\nthe cerebellum, and through the medulla oblongata to the spinal cord.\r\nInterference with these paths has the effect of disturbing motion of the\r\nparts reached by them. If all of the paths on one side are interfered\r\nwith, the result is paralysis of one side of the body.\r\n\r\nThe small brain, or cerebellum, governs the regularity, or coordination,\r\nof movements. Disturbances of the cerebellum cause a tottering,\r\nuncertain gait. In the medulla oblongata, which lies between the spinal\r\ncord and the cerebellum, are the centers governing the circulation and\r\nbreathing.\r\n\r\nThe spinal cord carries sensory messages to the brain and motor\r\nimpressions from the brain. The anterior portions of the cord contain\r\nthe motor paths, and the posterior portions of the cord contain the\r\nsensory paths.\r\n\r\nParalysis of a single member or a single group of muscles is known as\r\nmonoplegia and results from injury to the motor center or to a nerve\r\ntrunk leading to the part that is involved. Paralysis of one-half of the\r\nbody is known as hemiplegia and results from destruction or severe\r\ndisturbances of the cerebral hemisphere of the opposite side of the body\r\nor from interference with nerve paths between the cerebellum, or small\r\nbrain, and the spinal cord. Paralysis of the posterior half of the body\r\nis known as paraplegia and results from derangement of the spinal cord.\r\nIf the cord is pressed upon, cut, or injured, messages can not be\r\ntransmitted beyond that point, and so the posterior part becomes\r\nparalyzed. This is seen when the back is fractured.\r\n\r\nAbnormal mental excitement may be due to congestion of the brain or to\r\ninflammation. The animal so afflicted becomes vicious, pays no attention\r\nto commands, cries, runs about in a circle, stamps with the feet,\r\nstrikes, kicks, etc. This condition is usually followed by a dull,\r\nstupid state, in which the animal stands with his head down, dull and\r\nirresponsive to external stimuli. Cerebral depression also occurs in the\r\nsevere febrile infectious diseases, in chronic hydrocephalus, in chronic\r\ndiseases of the liver, in poisoning with a narcotic substance, and with\r\nchronic catarrh of the stomach and intestines.\r\n\r\nFainting is a symptom that is not often seen in horses. When it occurs\r\nit is shown by unsteadiness of gait, tottering, and, finally, inability\r\nto stand. The cause usually lies in a defect of the small brain, or\r\ncerebellum. This defect may be merely in respect of the blood supply, to\r\ncongestion, or to anemia, and in this case it is likely to pass away and\r\nmay never return, or it may be due to some permanent cause, as a tumor\r\nor an abscess, or it may result from a hemorrhage, from a defect of the\r\nvalves of the heart, or from poisoning.\r\n\r\nLoss of consciousness is known as coma. It is caused by hemorrhage in\r\nthe brain, by profound exhaustion, or may result from a saturation of\r\nthe system with the poison of some disease. Coma may follow upon\r\ncerebral depression, which occurs as a secondary state of inflammation\r\nof the brain.\r\n\r\nWhere the sensibility of a part is increased the condition is known as\r\nhyperesthesia, and where it is lost--that is, where there is no feeling\r\nor knowledge of pain--the condition is known as anesthesia. The former\r\nusually accompanies some chronic disease of the spinal cord or the\r\nearlier stages of irritation of a nerve trunk. Hyperesthesia is\r\ndifficult to detect in a nervous, irritable animal, and sometimes even\r\nin a horse of less sensitive temperament. An irritable, sensitive spot\r\nmay be found surrounded by skin that is not sensitive to pressure. This\r\nis sometimes a symptom of beginning of inflammation of the brain.\r\nAnesthesia occurs in connection with cerebral and spinal paralysis,\r\nsection of a nerve trunk leading to a part, in severe mental depression,\r\nand in narcotic poisoning.\r\n\r\n\r\nURINARY AND SEXUAL ORGANS.\r\n\r\nIn considering the examination of the urinary and sexual organs we may\r\nconsider, at the beginning, a false impression that prevails to an\r\nastonishing extent. Many horsemen are in the habit of pressings upon the\r\nback of a horse over the loins or of sliding the ends of the fingers\r\nalong on either side of the median line of this region. If the horse\r\ndepresses his back it is at once said \"his kidneys are weak.\" Nothing\r\ncould be more absurd or further from the truth. Any healthy horse--any\r\nhorse with normal sensation and with a normally flexible back--will\r\ncause it to sink when manipulated in this way. If the kidneys are\r\ninflamed and sensitive, the back is held more rigidly and is not\r\ndepressed under this pressure.\r\n\r\nTo examine the kidneys by pressure the pressure should be brought to\r\nbear over these organs. The kidneys lie beneath the ends of the\r\ntransverse processes of the vertebrae of the loins and beneath the\r\nhind-most ribs. If the kidneys are actually inflamed and especially\r\nsensitive, pressure or light blows applied here may cause the horse to\r\nshrink.\r\n\r\nThe physical examination of the sexual and generative organs is made in\r\nlarge part through the rectum, and this portion of the examination\r\nshould be carried out by a veterinarian only. By this means it is\r\npossible to discover or locate cysts of the kidneys, urinary calculi in\r\nthe ureters, bladder, or upper urethra, malformations, and acute\r\ninflammations accompanied by pain. The external genital organs are\r\nswollen, discolored, or show a discharge as a result of local disease or\r\nfrom disease higher in the tract.\r\n\r\nThe manner of urinating is sometimes of considerable diagnostic\r\nimportance. Painful urination is shown by frequent attempts, during\r\nwhich but a small quantity of urine is passed; by groaning, by\r\nconstrained attitude, etc. This condition comes from inflammation of the\r\nbladder or urethra, urinary calculi (stones of the bladder or urethra),\r\nhemorrhage, tumors, bruises, etc. The urine is retained from spasms of\r\nthe muscle at the neck of the bladder, from calculi, inflammatory\r\ngrowths, tumors, and paralysis of the bladder.\r\n\r\nThe urine dribbles without control when the neck of the bladder is\r\nweakened or paralyzed. This condition is seen after the bladder is\r\nweakened from long-continued retention and where there is a partial\r\nparalysis of the hind quarters.\r\n\r\nHorses usually void urine five to seven times a day, and pass from 4 to\r\n7 quarts. Disease may be shown by increase in the number of voidings or\r\nof the quantity. Frequent urination indicates an irritable or painful\r\ncondition of the bladder or urethra or that the quantity is excessive.\r\nIn one form of chronic inflammation of the kidneys (interstitial\r\nnephritis) and in polyuria the quantity may be increased to 20 or 30\r\nquarts daily. Diminution in the quantity of urine comes from profuse\r\nsweating, diarrhea, high fever, weak heart, diseased and nonsecreting\r\nkidneys, or an obstruction to the flow.\r\n\r\nThe urine of the healthy horse is a pale or at times a slightly reddish\r\nyellow. The color is less intense when the quantity is large, and is\r\nmore intense when the quantity is diminished. Dark-brown urine is seen\r\nin azoturia and in severe acute muscular rheumatism. A brownish-green\r\ncolor is seen in jaundice. Red color indicates admixture of blood from a\r\nbleeding point at some part of the urinary tract, usually in the\r\nkidneys.\r\n\r\nThe urine of the healthy horse is not clear and transparent. It contains\r\nmucus, which causes it to be slightly thick and stringy, and a certain\r\namount of undissolved carbonates, causing it to be cloudy. A sediment\r\ncollects when the urine is allowed to stand. The urine of the horse is\r\nnormally alkaline. If it becomes acid the bodies in suspension are\r\ndissolved and the urine is made clear. The urine may be unusually cloudy\r\nfrom the addition of abnormal constituents, but to determine their\r\ncharacter a chemical or microscopic examination is necessary. Red or\r\nreddish flakes or clumps in the urine are always abnormal, and denote a\r\nhemorrhage or suppuration in the urinary tract.\r\n\r\nThe normal specific gravity of the urine of the horse is about 1.040. It\r\nis increased when the urine is scanty and decreased when the quantity is\r\nexcessive.\r\n\r\nAcid reaction of the urine occurs in chronic intestinal catarrh, in high\r\nfever, and during starvation. Chemical and microscopic tests and\r\nexaminations are often of great importance in diagnosis, but require\r\nspecial apparatus and skill.\r\n\r\nOther points in the examination of a sick horse require more discussion\r\nthan can be afforded in this connection, and require special training on\r\nthe part of the examiner. Among such points may be mentioned the\r\nexamination of the organs of special sense, the examination of the\r\nblood, the microscopic examination of the secretions and excretions,\r\nbacteriological examinations of the secretions, excretions, and tissues,\r\nspecific reaction tests, and diagnostic inoculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF DISEASE.\r\n\r\nBy RUSH SHIPPEN HUIDEKOPER, M. D., VET.\r\n\r\n[Revised by Leonard Pearson, B. S., V. M. D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMAL TISSUES.\r\n\r\nThe nonprofessional reader may regard the animal tissues, which are\r\nsubject to inflammation, as excessively simple structures, as similar,\r\nsimple, and fixed in their organization as the joists and boards which\r\nframe a house, the bricks and iron coils of pipe which build a furnace,\r\nor the stones and mortar which make the support of a great railroad\r\nbridge. Yet while the principles of structure are thus simple, for the\r\ngeneral understanding by the student who begins their study the complete\r\nappreciation of the shades of variation, which differentiate one tissue\r\nfrom another, which define a sound tendon or a ligament from a fibrous\r\nband--the result of disease filling in an old lesion and tying one organ\r\nwith another--is as complicated as the nicest jointing of Chinese\r\nwoodwork, the building of a furnace for the most difficult chemical\r\nanalysis, or the construction of a bridge which will stand for ages and\r\nresist any force or weight.\r\n\r\nAll tissues are composed of certain fundamental and similar elements\r\nwhich are governed by the same rules of life, though at first glance\r\nthey may appear to be widely different. These are (a) amorphous\r\nsubstances, (b) fibers, and (c) cells.\r\n\r\n(a) Amorphous substances may be in liquid form, as in the fluid of the\r\nblood, which holds a vast amount of salts and nutritive matter in\r\nsolution; or they may be in a semiliquid condition, as the plasma which\r\ninfiltrates the loose meshes of connective tissue and lubricates the\r\nsurface of some membranes; or they may be in the form of a glue or\r\ncement, fastening one structure to another, as a tendon or muscle end to\r\na bone; or, again, they hold similar elements firmly together, as in\r\nbone, where they form a stiff matrix which becomes impregnated with lime\r\nsalts. Amorphous substances, again, form the protoplasm or nutritive\r\nelement of cells or the elements of life.\r\n\r\n(b) Fibers are formed of elements of organic matter which have only a\r\npassive function. They can be assimilated to little strings, or cords,\r\ntangled one with another like a mass of waste yarn, woven regularly like\r\na cloth, or bound together like a rope. They are of two kinds--white\r\nconnective tissue fibers, only slightly extensible, pliable, and very\r\nstrong, and yellow elastic fibers, elastic, curly, ramified, and very\r\ndense. These fibers once created require the constant presence of fluids\r\naround them in order to retain their functional condition, as a piece of\r\nharness leather demands continual oiling to keep its strength, but they\r\nundergo no change or alteration in their form until destroyed by death.\r\n\r\n(c) Cells, which may even be regarded as low forms of life, are masses\r\nof protoplasm or amorphous living matter, with a nucleus and frequently\r\na nucleolus, which are capable of assimilating nutriment or food,\r\npropagating themselves either into others of the same form or into fixed\r\ncells of another outward appearance and different function but of the\r\nsame constitution. It is simply in the mode of the grouping of these\r\nelements that we have the variation in tissues, as (1) loose connective\r\ntissue, (2) aponeurosis and tendons, (3) muscles, (4) cartilage, (5)\r\nbones, (6) epithelia and endothelia, (7) nerves.\r\n\r\n(1) Loose connective tissue forms the great framework, or scaffolding,\r\nof the body, and is found under the skin, between the muscles\r\nsurrounding the bones and blood vessels, and entering into the\r\nstructures of almost all the organs. In this the fibers are loosely\r\nmeshed together like a sponge, leaving spaces in which the nutrient\r\nfluid and cells are irregularly distributed. This tissue we find in the\r\nskin, in the spaces between the organs of the body where fat\r\naccumulates, and as the framework of all glands.\r\n\r\n(2) Aponeurosis and tendons are structures which serve for the\r\ntermination of muscles and for their contention, and for the attachment\r\nof bones together. In these the fibers are more frequent and dense, and\r\nare arranged with regularity, either crossing each other or lying\r\nparallel, and here the cells are found in minimum quantity.\r\n\r\n(3) In the muscles the cells lie end to end, forming long fibers which\r\nhave the power of contraction, and the connective tissue is in small\r\nquantity, serving the passive purpose of a band around the contractile\r\nelements.\r\n\r\n(4) In cartilage a mass of firm amorphous substance, with no vascularity\r\nand little vitality, forms the bed for the chondroplasts, or cells of\r\nthis tissue.\r\n\r\n(5) Bone differs from the above in having the amorphous matter\r\nimpregnated with lime salts, which gives it its rigidity and firmness.\r\n\r\n(6) Epithelia and endothelia, or the membranes which cover the body and\r\nline all its cavities and glands, are made up of single or stratified\r\nand multiple layers of cells bound together by a glue of amorphous\r\nsubstance and resting on a layer composed of fibers. When the membrane\r\nserves for secreting or excreting purposes, as in the salivary glands or\r\nthe kidneys, it is usually simple; when it serves the mechanical purpose\r\nof protecting a part, as over the tongue or skin, it is invariably\r\nmultiple and stratified, the surface wearing away while new cells\r\nreplace it from beneath.\r\n\r\n(7) In nerves, stellate cells are connected by their rays to each other,\r\nor to fibers which conduct the nerve impressions, or they act as\r\nreceptacles, storehouses, and transmitters for them, as the switch-board\r\nof a telephone system serves to connect the various wires.\r\n\r\nAll these tissues are supplied with blood in greater or less quantity.\r\nThe vascularity depends upon the function which the tissue is called\r\nupon to perform. If this is great, as in the tongue, the lungs, or the\r\nsensitive part of the hoof, a large quantity of blood is required; if\r\nthe labor is a passive one, as in cartilage, the membrane over the\r\nwithers, or the tendons of the legs, the vessels only reach the\r\nperiphery, and nutrition is furnished by imbibition of the fluids\r\nbrought to their surface by the blood vessels.\r\n\r\nBlood is brought to the tissues by arterioles, or the small terminations\r\nof the arteries, and is carried off from them by the veinlets, or the\r\ncommencement of the veins. Between these two systems are small, delicate\r\nnetworks of vessels called capillaries, which subdivide into a veritable\r\nlacework so as to reach the neighborhood of every element.\r\n\r\nIn health the blood passes through these capillaries with a regular\r\ncurrent, the red cells or corpuscles floating rapidly in the fluid in\r\nthe center of the channel, while the white or ameboid cells are\r\nattracted to the walls of the vessels and move very slowly. The supply\r\nof blood is regulated by the condition of repose or activity of the\r\ntissue, and under normal conditions the outflow exactly compensates the\r\nsupply. The caliber of the blood vessels, and consequently the quantity\r\nof blood which they carry, is governed by nerves of the sympathetic\r\nsystem in a healthy body with unerring regularity, but in a diseased\r\norgan the flow may cease or be greatly augmented. In health a tissue or\r\norgan receives its proper quantity of blood; the nutritive elements are\r\nextracted for the support of the tissue and for the product, which the\r\nfunction of the organ forms. The force required in the achievement of\r\nthis is furnished by combustion of the hydrocarbons and oxygen brought\r\nby the arterial blood, then by the veins this same fluid passes off,\r\nless its oxygen, loaded with the waste products, which are the result of\r\nthe worn-out and disintegrated tissues, and of those which have\r\nundergone combustion. The foregoing brief outline indicates the process\r\nof nutrition of the tissues.\r\n\r\nHypernutrition, or excessive nutrition of a tissue, may be normal or\r\nmorbid. If the latter, the tissue becomes congested or inflamed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGESTION.\r\n\r\nCongestion is an unnatural accumulation of blood in a part. Excessive\r\naccumulation of blood may be normal, as in blushing or in the red face\r\nwhich temporarily follows a violent muscular effort, or, as in the\r\nstomach or liver during digestion, or in the lungs after severe work,\r\nfrom which, in the latter case, it is shortly relieved by a little rapid\r\nbreathing. The term congestion, however, usually indicates a morbid\r\ncondition, with more or less lasting effects. Congestion is active or\r\npassive. The former is produced by an increased supply of blood to the\r\npart, the latter by an obstacle preventing the escape of blood from the\r\ntissue. In either case there is an increased supply of blood, and as a\r\nresult increased combustion and augmented nutrition.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTIVE CONGESTION.\r\n\r\nActive congestion is caused by--\r\n\r\n(1) _Functional activity._--Any organ which is constantly or excessively\r\nused is habituated to hold an unusual quantity of blood; the vessels\r\nbecome dilated; if overstrained the walls become weakened, lose their\r\nelasticity, and any sudden additional quantity of blood engorges the\r\ntissues so that they can not contract, and congestion results. Example:\r\nThe lungs of a race horse, after an unusual burst of speed or severe\r\nwork, in damp weather.\r\n\r\n(2) _Irritants._--Heat and cold, chemical or mechanical. Any of these,\r\nby threatening the vitality of a tissue, induce immediately an augmented\r\nflow of blood to the part to furnish the means of repair--a hot iron,\r\nfrostbites, acids, or a blow.\r\n\r\n(3) _Nerve influence._--This may produce congestion either by acting on\r\nthe part reflexly or as the result of some central nerve disturbance\r\naffecting the branch which supplies a given organ.\r\n\r\n(4) _Plethora and sanguinary temperament._--Full-blooded animals are\r\nmuch more predisposed to congestive diseases than those of a lymphatic\r\ncharacter or those in an anemic condition. The circulation in them is\r\nforced to all parts with much greater force and in large quantities. A\r\nwell-bred, full-blooded horse is much more subject to congestive\r\ndiseases than a common, coarse, or old, worn-out animal.\r\n\r\n(5) _Fevers._--In fever the heart works more actively and forces the\r\ncurrent of blood more rapidly; the tissues are weakened, and it requires\r\nbut a slight local cause at any part to congest the structures already\r\noverloaded with blood. Again, in certain fevers, we find alteration of\r\nthe blood itself, rendering it less or more fluid, which interferes with\r\nits free passage through the vessels and induces a local predisposition\r\nto congestion.\r\n\r\n(6) _Warm climate and summer heat._--Warmth of the atmosphere relaxes\r\nthe tissues; it demands of the animals less blood to keep up their own\r\nbody temperature, and the extra quantity accumulates in the blood-vessel\r\nsystem. It causes sluggishness in the performance of the organic\r\nfunctions, and in this way it induces congestion, especially of the\r\ninternal organs. So we find founders, congestive colics, and staggers\r\nmore frequent in summer than in winter.\r\n\r\n(7) _Previous congestion._--Whether the previous congestion of any organ\r\nhas been a continuous normal one--that is, a repeated functional\r\nactivity--or has been a morbid temporary overloading, it always leaves\r\nthe walls of the vessels weakened and more predisposed to recurrent\r\nattacks from accidental causes than are perfectly healthy tissues. Thus\r\na horse which has had a congestion of the lungs from a severe drive is\r\nliable to have another attack from even a lesser cause.\r\n\r\nThe alterations of congestion are distention of the blood vessels,\r\naccumulation of the cellular elements of the blood in them, and effusion\r\nof a portion of the liquid of the blood into the fibrous tissues which\r\nsurround the vessels. When the changes produced by congestion are\r\nvisible, as in the eye, the nostril, the mouth, the genital organs, and\r\non the surface of the body in white or unpigmented animals, the part\r\nappears red from the increase of blood; it becomes swollen from the\r\neffusion of liquid into the spongelike connective tissues; it is at\r\ntimes more or less hot from the increased combustion; the part is\r\nfrequently painful to the animal from pressure of the effusion on the\r\nnerves, and the function of the tissue is interfered with. The secretion\r\nor excretion of glands may be augmented or diminished. Muscles may be\r\naffected with spasms or may be unable to contract. The eyes and ears may\r\nbe affected with imaginary sights and sounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nPASSIVE CONGESTION.\r\n\r\nPassive congestion is caused by interference with the return of the\r\ncurrent of blood from a part.\r\n\r\nOld age and debility weaken the tissues and the force of the\r\ncirculation, especially in the veins, and retard the movement of the\r\nblood. We then see horses of this class with stocked legs, swelling of\r\nthe sheath of the penis or of the milk glands, and of the under surface\r\nof the belly. We find them also with effusions of the liquid parts of\r\nthe blood into the lymph spaces of the posterior extremities and organs\r\nof the pelvic cavity.\r\n\r\nTumors or other mechanical obstructions, by pressing on the veins,\r\nretard the flow of blood and cause it to back up in distal parts of the\r\nbody causing passive congestion.\r\n\r\nThe alterations of passive congestion, as in active congestion, consist\r\nof an increased quantity of blood in the vessels and an exudation of\r\nits fluid into the tissues surrounding them, but in passive congestion\r\nwe have a dark, thick blood which has lost its oxygen, instead of the\r\nrich, combustible blood rich in oxygen which is found in active\r\ncongestion.\r\n\r\nThe termination of congestion is by resolution or inflammation. In the\r\nfirst case, the choked-up blood vessels find an outlet for the excessive\r\nquantity of blood and are relieved; the transuded serum or fluid of the\r\nblood is reabsorbed, and the part returns almost to its normal\r\ncondition, with, however, a tendency to weakness predisposing to future\r\ntrouble of the same kind. In the other case further alterations take\r\nplace, and we have inflammation.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION.\r\n\r\n(Plates I and II.)\r\n\r\nInflammation is a hypernutrition of a tissue. It is described by Dr.\r\nAgnew, the surgeon, as \"a double-edged sword, cutting either way for\r\ngood or for evil.\" The increased nutrition may be moderate and cause a\r\ngrowth of new tissue, a simple increase of quantity at first; or it may\r\nproduce a new growth differing in quality; or it may be so great that,\r\nlike luxuriant, overgrown weeds, the elements die from their very haste\r\nof growth, and we have immediate destruction of the part. According to\r\nthe rapidity and intensity of the process of structural changes which\r\ntakes place in an inflamed tissue, inflammation is described as acute or\r\nchronic, with a vast number of intermediate forms. When the phenomena\r\nare marked it is termed sthenic; when less distinct, as the result of a\r\nbroken-down and feeble constitution in the animal, it is called\r\nasthenic. Certain inflammations are specific, as in strangles, the\r\nhorsepox, glanders, etc., where a characteristic or specific cause or\r\ncondition is added to the origin, character of phenomena, or alterations\r\nwhich result from an ordinary inflammation. An inflammation may be\r\ncircumscribed or limited, as in the abscess on the neck caused by the\r\npressure of a collar, in pneumonia, in glanders, in the small tumors of\r\na splint or a jack; or it may be diffuse, as in severe fistulas of the\r\nwithers, in an extensive lung fever, in the legs in a case of grease, or\r\nin the spavins which affect horses with poorly nourished bones. The\r\ncauses of inflammation are practically the same as those of congestion,\r\nwhich is the initial step of all inflammation.\r\n\r\nThe temperament of a horse predisposes the animal to inflammation of\r\ncertain organs. A full-blooded animal, whose veins show on the surface\r\nof the body, and which has a strong, bounding heart pumping large\r\nquantities of blood into the vascular organs like the lungs, the\r\nintestines, and the laminae of the feet, is more liable to have\r\npneumonia, congestive colics, and founder, than lymphatic, cold-blooded\r\nanimals which have pleurisies, inflammation of the bones, spavins,\r\nringbones, inflammation of the glands of the less vascular skin of the\r\nextremities, greasy heels, thrush, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I.\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION.\r\n\r\n1--_Uninflamed wing of the bat._\r\n\r\n2--_Inflamed wing of the bat._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II.\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION.\r\n\r\n1--_Non-inflamed mesentery of the frog, 400 diameters, reduced 1/2: a,\r\na, Venule with red and white corpuscles; b, b, Gelatinous nerve fibre;\r\nc, Capillary; d, d, Dark-bordered nerve fibre; e, e, Connective tissue\r\nwith connective tissue corpuscles and leucocytes scattered sparsely\r\nthrough it._\r\n\r\n2--_Inflamed mesentery of the frog, 400 diameters, reduced 1/2: a, a,\r\nVenule filled with red and white corpuscles, the red in the centre and\r\nthe white crowding along the walls; c, c, Capillary, distended with red\r\nand white corpuscles, number of the white much decreased; d, d,\r\nConnective tissue between venule and capillary filled with migrated\r\nleucocytes; e, e, Connective tissue with less infiltration; f,\r\nDark-bordered nerve fibre; g, Number of nuclei, in sheaths increased._]\r\n\r\nYoung horses have inflammation of the membranes lining the air passages\r\nand digestive tract, while older animals are more subject to troubles in\r\nthe closed serous sacs and in the bones.\r\n\r\nThe work to which a horse is put (saddle or harness, speed or draft)\r\nwill influence the predisposition of an animal to inflammatory diseases.\r\nAs in congestion, the functional activity of a part is an important\r\nfactor in localizing this form of disease. Given a group of horses\r\nexposed to the same draft of cold air or other exciting cause of\r\ninflammation, the one which has just been eating will be attacked with\r\nan inflammation of the bowels; the one that has just been working so as\r\nto increase its respiration will have an inflammation of the throat,\r\nbronchi, or lungs; the one that has just been using its feet excessively\r\nwill have a founder or inflammation of the laminae of the feet.\r\n\r\nThe direct cause of inflammation is usually an irritant of some form.\r\nThis may be a pathogenic organism--a disease germ--or it may be\r\nmechanical or chemical, external or internal. Cuts, bruises, injuries of\r\nany kind, parasites, acids, blisters, heat, cold, secretions, such as an\r\nexcess of tears over the cheek or urine on the legs, all cause\r\ninflammation by direct injury to the part. Strains or wrenches of\r\njoints, ligaments, and tendons cause trouble by laceration of the\r\ntissue.\r\n\r\nInflammations of the internal organs are caused by irritants as above,\r\nand by sudden cooling of the surface of the animal, which drives the\r\nblood to that organ which at the moment is most actively supplied with\r\nblood. This is called repercussion. A horse which has been worked at\r\nspeed and is breathing rapidly is liable to have pneumonia if suddenly\r\nchilled, while an animal which has just been fed is more liable to have\r\na congestive colic if exposed to the same influence, the blood in this\r\ncase being driven from the exterior to the intestines, while in the\r\nformer it was driven to the lungs.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms of inflammation are, as in congestion, change\r\nof color, due to an increased supply of blood; swelling, from the same\r\ncause, with the addition of an effusion into the surrounding tissues;\r\nheat, owing to the increased combustion in the part; pain, due to\r\npressure on the nerves, and altered function. This latter may be\r\naugmented or diminished, or first one and then the other. In addition to\r\nthe local symptoms, inflammation always produces more or less\r\nconstitutional disturbance or fever. A splint or small spavin will cause\r\nso little fever that it is not appreciable, while a severe spavin, an\r\ninflamed joint, or a pneumonia may give rise to a marked fever.\r\n\r\nThe alterations in an inflamed tissue are first those of congestion,\r\ndistention of the blood vessels, and exudation of the fluid of the blood\r\ninto the surrounding fibers, with, however, a more nearly complete\r\nstagnation of the blood; fibrin, or lymph, a plastic substance, is\r\nthrown out as well, and the cells, which we have seen to be living\r\norganisms in themselves, no longer carried in the current of the blood,\r\nmigrate from the vessels and, finding proper nutriment, proliferate or\r\nmultiply with greater or lesser rapidity. The cells which lie dormant in\r\nthe meshes of the surrounding fibers are awakened into activity by the\r\nnutritious lymph which surrounds them, and they also multiply.\r\n\r\nWhether the cell in an inflamed part is the white ameboid cell of the\r\nblood or the fixed connective tissue embedded in the fibers, it\r\nmultiplies in the same way. The nucleus in the center is divided into\r\ntwo, and then each again into two, ad infinitum. If the process is slow,\r\neach new cell may assimilate nourishment and become, like its ancestor,\r\nan aid in the formation of new tissues; if, however, the changing takes\r\nplace rapidly, the brood of young cells have not time to grow or use up\r\nthe surrounding nourishment, and, but half developed, they die, and we\r\nthen have destruction of tissue, and pus or matter is formed, a material\r\nmade up of the imperfect dead elements and the broken-down tissue.\r\nBetween the two there is an intermediate form, where we have imperfectly\r\nformed tissues, as in \"proud flesh,\" large, soft splints; fungous\r\ngrowths, greasy heels, and thrush.\r\n\r\nWhether the inflamed tissue is one like the skin, lungs, or intestines,\r\nvery loose in their texture, or a tendon or bone, dense in structure,\r\nand comparatively poor in blood vessels, the principle of the process is\r\nthe same. The effects, however, and the appearance may be widely\r\ndifferent. After a cut on the face or an exudation into the lungs, the\r\nloose tissues and multiple vessels allow the proliferating cells to\r\nobtain rich nourishment; absorption can take place readily, and the part\r\nregains its normal condition entirely, while a bruise at the heel or at\r\nthe withers finds a dense, inextensible tissue where the multiplying\r\nelements and exuded fluids choke up all communication, and the parts die\r\n(necrose) from want of blood and cause a serious quittor, or fistula.\r\n\r\nThis effect of structure of a part on the same process shows the\r\nimportance of a perfect knowledge in the study of a local trouble, and\r\nthe indispensable part which such knowledge plays in judging of the\r\ngravity of an inflammatory disease, and in formulating a prognosis or\r\nopinion of the final termination of it. It is this which allows the\r\nveterinarian, through his knowledge of the intimate structure of a part\r\nand the relations of its elements, to judge of the severity of a\r\ndisease, and to prescribe different modes of treatment in two animals\r\nfor troubles which, to the less experienced observer, appear to be\r\nabsolutely identical.\r\n\r\n_Termination of inflammation._--Like congestion, inflammation may\r\nterminate by resolution. In this case the exuded lymph undergoes\r\nchemical change, and the products are absorbed and carried off by the\r\nblood vessels and lymphatics, to be thrown out of the body by the\r\nkidneys, liver, the glands of the skin, and the other excretory organs.\r\nThe cells, which have wandered into the neighboring tissues from the\r\nblood vessels, gradually disappear or become transformed into fixed\r\ncells. Those which are the result of the tissue cells, wakened into\r\nactive life, follow the same course. The vessels themselves contract,\r\nand, having resumed their normal caliber, the part apparently reassumes\r\nits normal condition; but it is always weakened, and a new inflammation\r\nis more liable to reappear in a previously inflamed part than in a sound\r\none. The alternate termination is necrosis, or mortification. If the\r\nnecrosis, or death of a part, is gradual, by small stages, each cell\r\nlosing its vitality after the other in more or less rapid succession, it\r\ntakes the name of ulceration. If it occurs in a considerable part at\r\nonce, it is called gangrene. If this death of the tissues occurs deep in\r\nthe organism, and the destroyed elements and proliferated and dead cells\r\nare inclosed in a cavity, the result of the process is called an\r\nabscess. When it occurs on a surface, it is an ulcer, and an abscess by\r\nbreaking on the exterior becomes then also an ulcer. Proliferating and\r\ndying cells, and the fluid which exudes from an ulcerating surface and\r\nthe debris of broken-down tissue is known as pus, and the process by\r\nwhich this is formed is known as suppuration. A mass of dead tissue in a\r\nsoft part is termed a slough, while the same in bone is called a\r\nsequestrum. Such changes are especially liable to occur when the part\r\nbecomes infected with microorganisms that have the property of\r\ndestroying tissue and thus causing the production of pus. These are\r\nknown as pyogenic microorganisms. There are also bacilli that are\r\ncapable of multiplying in tissues and so irritating them as to cause\r\nthem to die (necrose) without forming pus.\r\n\r\n_Treatment of inflammation._--The study of the causes and pathological\r\nalterations of inflammation has shown the process to be one of\r\nhypernutrition, attended by excessive blood supply, so this study will\r\nindicate the primary factor to be employed in the treatment of it. Any\r\nagent which will reduce the blood supply and prevent the excessive\r\nnutrition of the elements of the part will serve as a remedy. The means\r\nemployed may be used locally to the part, or they may be constitutional\r\nremedies, which act indirectly.\r\n\r\n_Local treatment._--Removal of the cause will frequently allow the part\r\nto heal at once. Among causes of inflammation may be mentioned a stone\r\nin the frog, causing a traumatic thrush; a badly fitting harness or\r\nsaddle, causing ulcers of the skin; decomposing manure and urine in a\r\nstable, which, by their vapors, irritate the air tubes and lungs and\r\ncause a cough.\r\n\r\nMotion stimulates the action of the blood, and thus feeds an inflamed\r\ntissue. This is alike applicable to a diseased point irritated by\r\nmovement to an inflamed pair of lungs surcharged with blood by the use\r\ndemanded of them in a working animal, or to an inflamed eye exposed to\r\nlight, or an inflamed stomach and intestines still further fatigued by\r\nfeed. Rest, absolute quiet, a dark stable, and small quantities of\r\neasily digested feed will often cure serious inflammatory troubles\r\nwithout further treatment.\r\n\r\nThe application of ice bags or cold water by bandages, douching with a\r\nhose, or irrigation with dripping water, contracts the blood vessels,\r\nacts as a sedative to the nerves, and lessens the vitality of a part; it\r\nconsequently prevents the tissue change which inflammation produces.\r\n\r\nEither dry or moist heat acts as a derivative. It quickens the\r\ncirculation and renders the chemical changes more active in the\r\nsurrounding parts; it softens the tissues and attracts the current of\r\nblood from the inflamed organ; it also promotes the absorption of the\r\neffusion and hastens the elimination of the waste products in the part.\r\nHeat may be applied by hand rubbing or active friction and the\r\napplication of warm coverings (bandages) or by cloths wrung out of warm\r\nwater; or steaming with warm, moist vapor, medicated or not, will answer\r\nthe same purpose. The latter is especially applicable to inflammatory\r\ntroubles in the air passages.\r\n\r\nLocal bleeding frequently affords immediate relief by carrying off the\r\nexcessive blood and draining the effusion which has already occurred. It\r\naffords direct mechanical relief, and, by a stimulation of the part,\r\npromotes the chemical changes necessary for bringing the diseased\r\ntissues to a healthy condition. Local blood-letting can be done by\r\nscarifying, or making small punctures into the inflamed part, as in the\r\neyelid of an inflamed eye, or into the sheath of the penis, or into the\r\nskin of the latter organ when congested, or the leg when acutely\r\nswelled.\r\n\r\nCounterirritants are used for deep inflammations. They act by bringing\r\nthe blood to the surface and consequently lessening the blood pressure\r\nwithin. The derivation of the blood to the exterior diminishes the\r\namount in the internal organs and is often very rapid in its action in\r\nrelieving a congested lung or liver. The most common counterirritant is\r\nmustard flour. It is applied as a soft paste mixed with warm water to\r\nthe under surface of the belly and to the sides, where the skin is\r\ncomparatively soft and vascular. Colds in the throat or inflammations at\r\nany point demand the treatment applied in the same manner to the belly\r\nand sides and not to the throat or on the legs, as so often used.\r\nBlisters, iodin, and many other irritants are used in a similar way.\r\n\r\n_Constitutional treatment_ in inflammation is designed to reduce the\r\ncurrent of blood, which is the fuel for the inflammation in the diseased\r\npart, to quiet the patient, and to combat the fever or general effects\r\nof the trouble in the system, and to favor the neutralization or\r\nelimination of the products of the inflammation.\r\n\r\nReduction of blood is obtained in various ways. The diminution of the\r\nquantity of the blood lessens the amount of pressure on the vessels,\r\nand, as a sequel, the volume of it which is carried to the point of\r\ninflammation; it diminishes the body temperature or fever; it numbs the\r\nnervous system, which plays an important part as a conductor of\r\nirritation in diseases.\r\n\r\nBlood-letting is the most rapid means, and frequently acts like a charm\r\nin relieving a commencing inflammatory trouble. One must remember,\r\nhowever, that the strength of the body and repair depend on the blood;\r\nhence blood-letting should be practiced only in full-blooded,\r\nwell-nourished animals and in the early stages of the disease.\r\n\r\nCathartics act by drawing off a large quantity of fluid from the blood\r\nthrough the intestines, and have the advantage over the last remedy of\r\nremoving only the watery and not the formed elements from the\r\ncirculation. The blood cells remain, leaving the blood as rich as it was\r\nbefore. Again, the glands of the intestines are stimulated to excrete\r\nmuch waste matter and other deleterious material which may be acting as\r\na poison in the blood.\r\n\r\nDiuretics operate through the kidneys in the same way.\r\n\r\nDiaphoretics aid depletion of the blood by pouring water in the form of\r\nsweat from the surface of the skin and stimulating the discharge of\r\nwaste material out of its glands, which has the same effect on the blood\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nAntipyretics are remedies to reduce the temperature. This may be\r\naccomplished by depressing the center in the brain that controls heat\r\nproduction. Some coal-tar products are very effective in this way, but\r\nthey have the disadvantage of depressing the heart, which should always\r\nbe kept as strong as possible. If they are used it must be with\r\nknowledge of this fact, and it is well to give heart tonics or\r\nstimulants with them. The temperature of the body may be lowered by cold\r\npacks or by showering with cold water. This is a most useful procedure\r\nin many diseases.\r\n\r\nDepressants are drugs which act on the heart. They slow or weaken the\r\naction of this organ and reduce the quantity and force of the current of\r\nthe blood which is carried to the point of local disease; they lessen\r\nthe vitality of the animal, and for this reason are now used much less\r\nthan formerly.\r\n\r\nAnodynes quiet the nervous system. Pain in the horse, as in the man, is\r\none of the important factors in the production of fever, and the dulling\r\nof the former often prevents, or at least reduces, the latter. Anodynes\r\nproduce sleep, so as to rest the patient and allow recuperation for the\r\nsucceeding struggle of the vitality of the animal against the exhausting\r\ndrain of the disease.\r\n\r\nThe diet of an animal suffering from acute inflammation is a factor of\r\nthe greatest importance. An overloaded circulation can be starved to a\r\nreduced quantity and to a less rich quality of blood by reducing the\r\nquantity of feed given to the patient. Feeds of easy digestion do not\r\ntire the already fatigued organs of an animal with a torpid digestive\r\nsystem. Nourishment will be taken by a suffering brute in the form of\r\nslops and cooling drinks when it would be totally refused if offered in\r\nits ordinary form, as hard oats or dry hay, requiring the labor of\r\ngrinding between the teeth and swallowing by the weakened muscles of the\r\njaws and throat.\r\n\r\nTonics and stimulants are remedies which are used to meet special\r\nindications, as in the case of a feeble heart, and which enter into the\r\nafter treatment of inflammatory troubles as well as into the acute\r\nstages of them. They brace up weakened and torpid glands; they stimulate\r\nthe secretion of the necessary fluids of the body, and hasten the\r\nexcretion of the waste material produced by the inflammatory process;\r\nthey regulate the action of a weakened heart; they promote healthy\r\nvitality of diseased parts, and aid the chemical changes needed for\r\nreturning the altered tissues to their normal condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEVERS.\r\n\r\nFever is a general condition of the animal body in which there is an\r\nelevation of the animal body temperature, which may be only a degree or\r\ntwo or may be 10 deg. F. The elevation of the body temperature, which\r\nrepresents tissue change or combustion, is accompanied with an\r\nacceleration of the heart's action, a quickening of the respiration, and\r\nan aberration in the functional activity of the various organs of the\r\nbody. These organs may be stimulated to the performance of excessive\r\nwork, or they may be incapacitated from carrying out their allotted\r\ntasks, or, in the course of a fever, the two conditions may both exist,\r\nthe one succeeding the other. Fever as a disease is usually preceded by\r\nchills as an essential symptom.\r\n\r\nFevers are divided into essential fevers and symptomatic fevers. In\r\nsymptomatic fever some local disease, usually of an inflammatory\r\ncharacter, develops first, and the constitutional febrile phenomena are\r\nthe result of the primary point of combustion irritating the whole body,\r\neither through the nervous system or directly by means of the waste\r\nmaterial which is carried into the circulation and through the blood\r\nvessels, and is distributed to distal parts. Essential fevers are those\r\nin which there is from the outset a general disturbance of the whole\r\neconomy. This may consist of an elementary alteration in the blood or a\r\ngeneral change in the constitution of the tissues. Fevers of the latter\r\nclass are usually due to some infecting agent and belong, therefore, to\r\nthe class of infectious diseases.\r\n\r\nEssential fevers are subdivided into ephemeral fevers, which last but a\r\nshort time and terminate by critical phenomena; intermittent fevers, in\r\nwhich there are alterations of exacerbations of the febrile symptoms and\r\nremissions, in which the body returns to its normal condition or\r\nsometimes to a depressed condition, in which the functions of life are\r\nbut badly performed; and continued fevers, which include contagious\r\ndiseases, such as glanders, influenza, etc., the septic diseases, such\r\nas pyemia, septicemia, etc., and the eruptive fevers, such as variola,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nWhether the cause of the fever has been an injury to the tissues, such\r\nas a severe bruise, a broken bone, an inflamed lung, or excessive work,\r\nwhich has surcharged the blood with the waste products of the combustion\r\nof the tissues, which were destroyed to produce force, or the toxins of\r\ninfluenza in the blood, or the presence of irritating material, either\r\nin the form of living organisms or of their products, as in glanders or\r\ntuberculosis--the general train of symptoms are much the same, varying\r\nas the amount of the irritant differs in quantity, or when some special\r\nquality in them has a specific action on one or another tissue.\r\n\r\nThere is in fever at first a relaxation of the small blood vessels,\r\nwhich may have been preceded by a contraction of the same if there was a\r\nchill, and as a consequence there is an acceleration of the current of\r\nthe blood. There is, then, an elevation of the peripheral temperature,\r\nfollowed by a lowering of tension in the arteries and an acceleration in\r\nthe movement of the heart. These conditions may be produced by a primary\r\nirritation of the nerve centers of the brain from the effects of heat,\r\nas is seen in thermic fever, or sunstroke, or by the entrance into the\r\nblood stream of disease-producing organisms or their chemical products,\r\nas in anthrax, rinderpest, influenza, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are times when it is difficult to distinguish between the\r\nexistence of fever as a disease and a temporary feverish condition which\r\nis the result of excessive work. Like the condition of congestion of the\r\nlungs, which is normal up to a certain degree in the lungs of a race\r\nhorse after a severe race, and morbid when it produces more than\r\ntemporary phenomena or when it causes distinct lesions, the temperature\r\nmay rise from physiological causes as much as four degrees, so fever,\r\nor, as it is better termed, a feverish condition, may follow any work or\r\nother employment of energy in which excessive tissue change has taken\r\nplace; but if the consequences are ephemeral, and no recognizable lesion\r\nis apparent, it is not considered morbid. This condition, however, may\r\npredispose to severe organic disturbance and local inflammations which\r\nwill cause disease, as an animal in this condition is liable to take\r\ncold and develop lung fever or a severe enteritis, if chilled or\r\notherwise exposed.\r\n\r\nFever in all animals is characterized by the same general phenomena, but\r\nwe find the intensity of the symptoms modified by the species of animals\r\naffected, by the races which subdivide the species, by the families\r\nwhich form groups of the races, and by certain conditions in individuals\r\nthemselves. For example, a pricked foot in a Thoroughbred may cause\r\nintense fever, while the same injury in the foot of a Clydesdale may\r\nscarcely cause a visible general symptom. In the horse, fever produces\r\nthe following symptoms:\r\n\r\nThe normal body temperature, which varies from 99 deg. to 100 deg. F., is\r\nelevated from 1 deg. to 9 deg.. A temperature of 102 deg. or 103 deg. F. is moderate\r\nfever, 104 deg. to 105 deg. F. is high, and 106 deg. F. and over is excessive. The\r\ntemperature is accurately measured by means of a clinical thermometer\r\ninserted in the rectum.\r\n\r\nThis elevation of temperature can readily be felt by the hand placed in\r\nthe mouth of the animal, or in the rectum, and in the cleft between the\r\nhind legs. It is usually appreciable at any point over the surface of\r\nthe body and in the expired air emitted from the nostrils. The ears and\r\ncannons are often as hot as the rest of the body, but are sometimes\r\ncold, which denotes a debility in the circulation and irregular\r\ndistribution of the blood. The pulse, which in a healthy horse is felt\r\nbeating about 42 to 48 times in the minute, is increased to 60, 70, 90,\r\nor even 100. The respirations are increased from 14 or 16 to 24, 30, 36,\r\nor even more. With the commencement of a fever the horse usually has\r\ndiminished appetite, or it may have total loss of appetite if the fever\r\nis excessive. There is, however, a vast difference among horses in this\r\nregard. With the same degree of elevation of temperature one horse may\r\nlose its appetite entirely, while another, usually of the more common\r\nsort, will eat at hay throughout the course of the fever, and will even\r\ncontinue to eat oats or other grains. Thirst is usually increased, but\r\nthe animal desires only a small quantity of water at a time, and in most\r\ncases of fever a bucket of water should be kept standing before the\r\npatient, which may be allowed to drink ad libitum. The skin becomes dry\r\nand the hairs stand on end. Sweating is almost unknown in the early\r\nstage of fevers, but frequently occurs later in their course, when an\r\noutbreak of warm sweat is often a most favorable symptom. The mucous\r\nmembranes, which are most easily examined in the conjunctivae of the eyes\r\nand inside of the mouth, change color if the fever is an acute one;\r\nwithout alteration of blood the mucous membranes become of a rosy or\r\ndeep-red color at the outset; if the fever is attended with distinct\r\nalteration of the blood, as in influenza, and at the end of two or three\r\ndays in severe cases of pneumonia or other extensive inflammatory\r\ntroubles the mucous membranes are tinged with yellow, which may even\r\nbecome a deep ocher in color, the result of the decomposition of the\r\nblood corpuscles and the freeing of their coloring matter, which acts as\r\na stain. At the outset of a fever the various glands are checked in\r\ntheir secretions, the salivary glands fail to secrete the saliva, and we\r\nfind the surface of the tongue and inside of the cheeks dry and covered\r\nwith a brownish, bad-smelling deposit. The excretion from the liver and\r\nintestinal glands is diminished and produces an inactivity of the\r\ndigestive organs which causes a constipation. If this is not remedied at\r\nan early period, the undigested material acts as an irritant, and later\r\nwe may have it followed by an inflammatory process, producing a severe\r\ndiarrhea.\r\n\r\nThe excretion from the kidneys is sometimes at first entirely\r\nsuppressed. It is always considerably diminished, and what urine is\r\npassed is dark in color, undergoes ammoniacal change rapidly, and\r\ndeposits quantities of salts. At a later period the diminished excretion\r\nmay be replaced by an excessive excretion, which aids in carrying off\r\nwaste products and usually indicates an amelioration of the fever.\r\n\r\nWhile the ears, cannons, and hoofs of a horse suffering from fever are\r\nusually found hot, they may frequently alternate from hot to cold, or be\r\nmuch cooler than they normally are. This latter condition usually\r\nindicates great weakness on the part of the circulatory system.\r\n\r\nIt is of the greatest importance, as an aid in diagnosing the gravity of\r\nan attack of fever and as an indication in the selection of its mode of\r\ntreatment, to recognize the exact cause of a febrile condition in the\r\nhorse. In certain cases, in very nervous animals, in which fever is the\r\nresult of nerve influence, a simple anodyne, or even only quiet with\r\ncontinued care and nursing, will sometimes be sufficient to diminish it.\r\nWhen fever is the result of local injury, the cure of the cause produces\r\na cessation in the constitutional symptoms. When it is the result of a\r\npneumonia or other severe parenchymatous inflammation, it usually lasts\r\nfor a definite time, and subsides with the first improvement of the\r\nlocal trouble, but in these cases we constantly have exacerbations of\r\nfever due to secondary inflammatory processes, such as the formation of\r\nsmall abscesses, the development of secondary bronchitis, or the death\r\nof a limited quantity of tissue (gangrene).\r\n\r\nIn specific cases, such as influenza, strangles, and septicemia, there\r\nis a definite poison in the blood-vessel system and carried to the heart\r\nand to the nervous system, which produces a peculiar irritation, usually\r\nlasting for a specific period, during which the temperature can be but\r\nslightly diminished by any remedy.\r\n\r\nIn cases attended with complications, the diagnosis at times becomes\r\nstill more difficult, as at the end of a case of influenza which becomes\r\ncomplicated with pneumonia. The high temperature of the simple\r\ninflammatory disease may be grafted on that of the specific trouble, and\r\nthe determination of the cause of the fever, as between the two, is\r\ntherefore frequently a difficult matter but an important one, as upon it\r\ndepends the mode of treatment.\r\n\r\nAny animal suffering from fever, whatever the cause, is much more\r\nsusceptible to attacks of local inflammation, which become complications\r\nof the original disease, than are animals in sound health. In fever we\r\nhave the tissues and the walls of the blood vessels weakened, we have an\r\nincreased current of more or less altered blood flowing through the\r\nvessels and stagnating in the capillaries, which need but an exciting\r\ncause to transform the passive congestion of fever into an active\r\ncongestion and acute inflammation. These conditions become still more\r\ndistinct when the fever is accompanied with a decided deterioration in\r\nthe blood itself, as is seen in influenza, septicemia, and at the\r\ntermination of severe pneumonias.\r\n\r\nFever, with its symptoms of increased temperature, acceleration of the\r\npulse, acceleration of respiration, dry skin, diminished secretions,\r\netc., must be considered as an indication of organic disturbance. This\r\norganic disturbance may be the result of local inflammation or other\r\nirritants acting through the nerves on nerve centers, alterations of the\r\nblood, in which a poison is carried to the nerve centers, or direct\r\nirritants to the nerve centers themselves, as in cases of heat stroke,\r\ninjury to the brain, etc.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of fever depends upon its cause. One of the important\r\nfactors in treatment is absolute quiet. This may be obtained by placing\r\na sick horse in a box stall, away from other animals and extraneous\r\nnoises and sheltered from excessive light and drafts of air. Anodynes,\r\nbelladonna, hyoscyamus, and opium act as antipyretics simply by quieting\r\nthe nervous system. As an irritant exists in the blood in most cases of\r\nfever, any remedy which will favor the excretion of foreign elements\r\nfrom it will diminish this cause. We therefore use diaphoretics to\r\nstimulate the sweat and excretions from the skin; diuretics to favor the\r\nelimination of matter by the kidneys; cholagogues and laxatives to\r\nincrease the action of the liver and intestines, and to drain from these\r\nimportant organs all the waste material which is aiding to choke up and\r\ncongest their rich plexuses of blood vessels. The heart becomes\r\nstimulated to increased action at the outset of a fever, but this does\r\nnot indicate increased strength; on the contrary, it indicates the\r\naction of an irritant to the heart that will soon weaken it. It is,\r\ntherefore, irrational further to depress the heart by the use of such\r\ndrugs as aconite. It is better to strengthen it and to favor the\r\nelimination of the substance that is irritating it. The increased blood\r\npressure throughout the body may be diminished by lessening the quantity\r\nof blood. This is obtained in some cases with advantage when the disease\r\nis but starting and the animal is plethoric by direct abstraction of\r\nblood, as in bleeding from the jugular or other veins; or by\r\nderivatives, such as mustard, turpentine, or blisters applied to the\r\nskin; or by setons, which draw to the surface the fluid of the blood,\r\nthereby lessening its volume without having the disadvantage of\r\nimpoverishing the elements of the blood found in bleeding. In many cases\r\nantipyretics given by the mouth and cold applied to the skin are most\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\nWhen the irritation which is the cause of fever is a specific one,\r\neither in the form of bacteria (living organisms), as in glanders,\r\ntuberculosis, influenza, septicemia, etc., or in the form of a foreign\r\nelement, as in rheumatism, gout, hemaglobinuria, and other so-called\r\ndiseases of nutrition, we employ remedies which have been found to have\r\na direct specific action on them. Among the specific remedies for\r\nvarious diseases are counted quinin, carbolic acid, salicylic acid,\r\nantipyrene, mercury, iodin, the empyreumatic oils, tars, resins,\r\naromatics, sulphur, and a host of other drugs, some of which are of\r\nknown effect and others of which are theoretical in action. Certain\r\nremedies, like simple aromatic teas, vegetable acids, such as vinegar,\r\nlemon juice, etc., alkalines in the form of salts, sweet spirits of\r\nniter, etc., which are household remedies, are always useful, because\r\nthey act on the excreting organs and ameliorate the effects of fever.\r\nOther remedies, which are to be used to influence the cause of fever,\r\nmust be selected with judgment and from a thorough knowledge of the\r\nnature of the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF ADMINISTERING MEDICINES.\r\n\r\nBy CH. B. MICHENER, V. S.\r\n\r\n[Revised by Leonard Pearson, B. S., V. M. D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMedicine may enter the body through any of the following designated\r\nchannels: First, by the mouth; second, by the air passages; third, by\r\nthe skin; fourth, by the tissue beneath the skin (hypodermic methods);\r\nfifth, by the rectum; sixth, by the genito-urinary passages; and,\r\nseventh, by the blood (intravenous injections).\r\n\r\nBY THE MOUTH.--Medicines can be given by the mouth in the form of\r\nsolids, as powders or pills; liquids, and pastes, or electuaries.\r\n\r\n_Powders._--Solids administered as powders should be as finely\r\npulverized as possible, in order to obtain rapid solution and\r\nabsorption. Their action is in this way facilitated and intensified.\r\nPowders must be free from any irritant or caustic action upon the mouth.\r\nThose that are without any disagreeable taste or smell are readily eaten\r\nwith the feed or taken in the drinking water. When placed with the feed\r\nthey should first be dissolved or suspended in water and thus sprinkled\r\non the feed. If mixed dry the horse will often leave the medicine in the\r\nbottom of his manger. Nonirritant powders may be given in capsules, as\r\nballs are given.\r\n\r\n_Pills, or \"balls\"_ when properly made, are cylindrical in shape, 2\r\ninches in length and about three-fourths of an inch in diameter. They\r\nshould be fresh, but if necessary to keep them some time they should be\r\nmade up with glycerin, or some such agent, to prevent their becoming too\r\nhard. Very old, hard balls are sometimes passed whole with the manure\r\nwithout being acted upon at all. Paper is sometimes wrapped around balls\r\nwhen given, if they are so sticky as to adhere to the fingers or the\r\nballing gun. Paper used for this purpose should be thin but firm, as the\r\ntougher tissue papers. Balls are preferred to drenches when the medicine\r\nis extremely disagreeable or nauseating; when the dose is not too large;\r\nwhen the horse is difficult to drench; or when the medicine is intended\r\nto act slowly. Certain medicines can not or should not be made into\r\nballs, as medicines requiring to be given in large doses, oils, caustic\r\nsubstances, unless in small dose and diluted and thoroughly mixed with\r\nthe vehicle, deliquescent, or efflorescent salts. Substances suitable\r\nfor balls can be made up by the addition of honey, sirup, soap, etc.,\r\nwhen required for immediate use. Gelatin capsules of different sizes are\r\nnow obtainable and are a convenient means of giving medicines in ball\r\nform.\r\n\r\nWhen balls are to be given we should observe the following directions:\r\nIn shape they should be cylindrical, of the size above mentioned, and\r\nsoft enough to be easily compressed by the fingers. If made round or\r\negg-shaped, if too long or too hard, they are liable to become fixed in\r\nthe gullet and cause choking. Balls may be given with the \"balling gun\"\r\n(obtainable at any veterinary instrument maker's) or by the hand. If\r\ngiven by the hand a mouth speculum or gag may be used to prevent the\r\nanimal from biting the hand or crushing the ball. Always loosen the\r\nhorse before attempting to give a ball; if tied he may break his halter\r\nand injure himself or the one giving the ball. With a little practice it\r\nis much easier to give a ball without the mouth gag, as the horse always\r\nfights more or less against having his mouth forced open. The tongue\r\nmust be firmly grasped with the left hand and gently pulled forward; the\r\nball, slightly moistened, is then to be placed with the tips of the\r\nfingers of the right hand as far back into the mouth as possible; as the\r\ntongue is loosened it is drawn back into the mouth and carries the ball\r\nbackward with it. The mouth should be kept closed for a minute or two.\r\nWe should always have a pail of water at hand to offer the horse after\r\nballing. This precaution will often prevent him from coughing out the\r\nball or its becoming lodged in the gullet.\r\n\r\n_Pastes or electuaries_ are medicines mixed with licorice-root powder,\r\nground flaxseed, molasses, or sirup to the consistency of honey, or a\r\n\"soft solid.\" They are intended, chiefly, to act locally upon the mouth\r\nand throat. They are given by being spread upon the tongue, gums, or\r\nteeth with a wooden paddle or strong, long-handled spoon.\r\n\r\n_Liquids._--It is, very often, impossible to get balls properly made, or\r\nto induce owners or attendants to attempt to give them, and for these\r\nreasons medicines by the mouth are mostly given in the form of liquids.\r\nLiquids may be given as drenches when the dose is large, or they may,\r\nwhen but a small quantity is administered, be injected into the mouth\r\nwith a hard-rubber syringe or be poured upon the tongue from a small\r\nvial.\r\n\r\nWhen medicine is to be given as a drench we must be careful to use water\r\nor oil enough to dissolve or dilute it thoroughly; more than this Wakes\r\nthe drench bulky and is unnecessary. Insoluble medicines, if not\r\nirritant or corrosive, may be given simply suspended in water, the\r\nbottle to be well shaken immediately before giving the drench. The\r\nbottle used for drenching purposes should be clean, strong, and smooth\r\nabout its neck; it should be without shoulders, tapering, and of a size\r\nto suit the amount to be given. A horn or tin bottle may be better,\r\nbecause it is not so easily broken by the teeth. If the dose is a small\r\none the horse's head may be held up by the left hand, while the medicine\r\nis poured into the mouth by the right. The left thumb is to be placed in\r\nthe angle of the lower jaw, and the fingers spread out in such manner\r\nas to support the lower lip. Should the dose be large, the horse ugly,\r\nor the attendant unable to support the head as directed above, the head\r\nis then to be held up by running the tines of a long-handled wooden fork\r\nunder the noseband of the halter or the halter strap or a rope may be\r\nfastened to the noseband and thrown over a limb, beam, or through a\r\npulley suspended from the ceiling. Another way of supporting the head is\r\nto place a loop in the end of a rope, and introduce this loop into the\r\nmouth just behind the upper front teeth or tusks of the upper jaw, the\r\nfree end to be run through a pulley, as before described, and held by an\r\nassistant. It is never to be fastened, as the horse might in that case\r\ndo himself serious injury. The head is to be elevated just enough to\r\nprevent the horse from throwing the liquid out of his mouth. The line of\r\nthe face should be horizontal, or only the least bit higher. If the head\r\nis drawn too high the animal can not swallow with ease or even with\r\nsafety. (If this is doubted, just fill your mouth with water, throw-back\r\nthe head as far as possible, and then try to swallow.) The person giving\r\nthe drench should stand on some object in order to reach the horse's\r\nmouth--on a level, or a little above it. The bottle or horn is then to\r\nbe introduced at the side of the mouth, in front of the molar teeth, in\r\nan upward direction. This will cause the horse to open his mouth, when\r\nthe base of the bottle is to be elevated, and about 4 ounces of the\r\nliquid allowed to escape on the tongue as far back as possible, care\r\nbeing taken not to get the neck of the bottle between the back teeth.\r\nThe bottle is to be immediately removed, and if the horse does not\r\nswallow this can be encouraged by rubbing the fingers or neck of the\r\nbottle against the roof of the mouth, occasionally removing them. As\r\nsoon as this is swallowed repeat the operation until he has taken all\r\nthe drench. If coughing occurs, or if, by any mishap, the bottle should\r\nbe crushed in the mouth, lower the head immediately.\r\n\r\nDo not rub, pinch, or pound the throat nor draw out the tongue when\r\ngiving a drench. These processes in no way aid the horse to swallow and\r\noftener do harm than good. In drenching, swallowing may be hastened by\r\npouring into the nose of the horse, while the head is high, a few\r\nteaspoonfuls of clean water, but _drenches must never be given through\r\nthe nose_. Large quantities of medicine given by pouring into the nose\r\nare liable to strangle the animal, or, if the medicine is irritating, it\r\nsets up an inflammation of the nose, fauces, windpipe, and sometimes the\r\nlungs.\r\n\r\nBY THE AIR PASSAGES.--Medicines are administered to the lungs and upper\r\nair passages by insufflation, inhalation, injection, and nasal douche.\r\n\r\n_Insufflation_ consists in blowing an impalpable powder directly into\r\nthe nose. It is but rarely resorted to.\r\n\r\n_Inhalation._--Gaseous and volatile medicines are given by inhalation,\r\nas is also medicated steam or vapor. Of the gases used there may be\r\nmentioned, as the chief ones, sulphurous acid gas and, occasionally,\r\nchlorin. The animal or animals are to be placed in a tight room, where\r\nthese gases are generated until the atmosphere is sufficiently\r\nimpregnated with them. Volatile medicines--as the anesthetics (ether,\r\nchloroform, etc.)--are to be given by the attending surgeon only.\r\nMedicated vapors are to be inhaled by placing a bucket containing hot\r\nwater, vinegar and water, scalded hay or bran, to which carbolic acid,\r\niodin, compound tincture of benzoin, or other medicines have been added,\r\nin the bottom of a long grain bag. The horse's nose is to be inserted\r\ninto the top of the bag, and he thus inhales the \"medicated steam.\" Care\r\nmust be taken not to have it hot enough to scald the animal. The vapor\r\nfrom scalding bran or hay is often thus inhaled to favor discharges in\r\nsore throat or \"distemper.\"\r\n\r\n_Injections_ are made into the trachea by means of a hypodermic syringe.\r\nThis method of medication is used for the purpose of treating local\r\ndiseases of the trachea and upper bronchial tubes. It has also been used\r\nas a mode of administering remedies for their constitutional effect, but\r\nis now rarely used for this purpose.\r\n\r\n_The nasal douche_ is employed by the veterinarian in treating some\r\nlocal diseases of the nasal chambers. Special appliances and\r\nprofessional knowledge are necessary when using liquid medicines by this\r\nmethod. It is not often resorted to, even by veterinary surgeons, since,\r\nas a rule, the horse objects very strongly to this mode of medication.\r\n\r\nBY THE SKIN.--Medicines are often administered to our hair-covered\r\nanimals by the skin, yet care must be taken in applying some\r\nmedicines--as tobacco water, carbolic-acid solutions, strong creolin\r\nsolutions, mercurial ointment, etc.--over the entire body, as poisoning\r\nand death follow in some instances from absorption through the skin. For\r\nthe same reasons care must also be exercised and poisonous medicines not\r\napplied over very large raw or abraded surfaces. With domestic animals\r\nmedicines are only to be applied by the skin to allay local pain or cure\r\nlocal disease.\r\n\r\nBY THE TISSUE BENEATH THE SKIN (HYPODERMATIC METHOD).--Medicines are\r\nfrequently given by the hypodermic syringe under the skin. It is not\r\nsafe for any but medical or veterinary practitioners to use this form of\r\nmedication, since the medicines thus given are powerful poisons. There\r\nare many precautions to be observed, and a knowledge of anatomy is\r\nindispensable. One of the chief precautions has to do with the\r\nsterilization of the syringe. If it is not sterile an abscess may be\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nBY THE RECTUM.--Medicines may be given by the rectum when they can not\r\nbe given by the mouth, or when they are not retained in the stomach;\r\nwhen we want a local action on the last gut; when it is desired to\r\ndestroy the small worms infesting the large bowels or to stimulate the\r\nperistaltic motion of the intestines and cause evacuation. Medicines are\r\nin such cases given in the form of suppositories or as liquid injections\r\n(enemas.) Foods may also be given in this way.\r\n\r\n_Suppositories_ are conical bodies made up of oil of theobroma and opium\r\n(or whatever medicine is indicated in special cases), and are introduced\r\ninto the rectum or vagina to allay irritation and pain of these parts.\r\nThey are not much used in treating horses.\r\n\r\n_Enemas_, when given for absorption, should be small in quantity,\r\nneutral or slightly acid in reaction, and of a temperature of from 90 deg.\r\nto 100 deg. F. These, like feeds given by the rectum, should be introduced\r\nonly after the last bowel has been emptied by the hand or by copious\r\ninjections of tepid water. Enemas, or clysters, if to aid the action of\r\nphysics, should be in quantities sufficient to distend the bowel and\r\ncause the animal to eject them. Simple water, salt and water, or soap\r\nand water, in quantities of a gallon or more, may be given every half\r\nhour. It is best that the horse retain them for some little time, as the\r\nliquid serves to moisten the dung and favors a passage. Stimulating\r\nenemas, as glycerin, should be administered after those already\r\nmentioned have emptied the last bowel, with the purpose of still further\r\nincreasing the natural motion of the intestines and aiding the purging\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nLiquids may be thrown into the rectum by the means of a large syringe or\r\na pump. A very good \"irrigator\" can be bought of any tinsmith at a\r\ntrifling cost, and should be constantly at hand on every stock farm. It\r\nconsists of a funnel about 6 inches deep and 7 inches in diameter, which\r\nis to be furnished with a prolongation to which a piece of rubber hose,\r\nsuch as small garden hose, 4 feet long may be attached. The hose, well\r\noiled, is to be inserted gently into the rectum about 2 feet. The liquid\r\nto be injected may then be poured in the funnel and the pressure of the\r\natmosphere will force it into the bowels. This appliance is better than\r\nthe more complicated and expensive ones.\r\n\r\nOrdinary cold water or even ice-cold water is highly recommended by many\r\nas a rectal injection for horses overcome by the excessive heat of\r\nsummer, and may be given by this simple pipe.\r\n\r\nBY THE GENITO-URINARY PASSAGES.--This method of medication is especially\r\nuseful in treating local diseases of the genito-urinary organs. It finds\r\nits chief application in the injection and cleansing of the uterus and\r\nvagina. For this purpose a large syringe or the irrigator described\r\nabove may be used.\r\n\r\nBY THE BLOOD.--Injections directly into veins are to be practiced by\r\nmedical or veterinary practitioners only, as are probably some other\r\nmeans of giving medicines--intratracheal injections, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III.\r\n\r\nDIGESTIVE APPARATUS.\r\n\r\n1.

D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not an easy task to write \"a plain account of the common diseases,\r\nwith directions for preventive measures, hygienic care, and the simpler\r\nforms of medical treatment,\" of the digestive organs of the horse. Being\r\nlimited as to space, the endeavor has been made to give simply an\r\noutline--to state the most important facts--leaving many gaps, and\r\ncontinually checking the disposition to write anything like a full\r\ndescription as to cause, prevention, and modes of treatment of diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER.\r\n\r\nIt is generally held, at least in practice, that any water that stock\r\ncan be induced to drink is sufficiently pure for their use. This\r\npractice occasions losses that would startle us if statistics were at\r\nhand. Water that is impure from the presence of decomposing organic\r\nmatter, such as is found in wells and ponds in close proximity to manure\r\nheaps and cesspools, is frequently the cause of diarrhea, dysentery, and\r\nmany other diseases of stock, while water that is impregnated with\r\ndifferent poisons and contaminated in very many instances with specific\r\nmedia of contagion produces death.\r\n\r\nConsidering first the quantity of water required by the horse, it may be\r\nstated that when our animals have access to water continually they never\r\ndrink to excess. Were the horse subjected to ship voyages or any other\r\ncircumstances where he must depend upon his attendant for the supply of\r\nwater, it may be roughly stated that he requires a daily average of\r\nabout 8 gallons of water. This varies somewhat upon the character of his\r\nfeed; if upon green feed, less water will be needed than when fed upon\r\ndry hay and grain.\r\n\r\nThe time of giving water should be carefully studied. At rest, the horse\r\nshould receive it at least three times a day; when at work, more\r\nfrequently. The rule should be to give it in small quantities and often.\r\nThere is a popular fallacy that if a horse is warm he should not be\r\nallowed to drink, many asserting that the first swallow of water\r\n\"founders\" the animal or produces colic. This is erroneous. No matter\r\nhow warm a horse may be, it is always entirely safe to allow him from\r\nsix to ten swallows of water. If this is given on going into the\r\nstable, he should have at once a pound or two of hay and allowed to rest\r\nabout an hour before feeding. If water is now offered him it will in\r\nmany cases be refused, or at least he will drink but sparingly. The\r\ndanger, then, is not in the \"first swallow\" of water, but is due to the\r\nexcessive quantity that the animal will take when warm if he is not\r\nrestrained.\r\n\r\nIce-cold water should never be given to horses. It may not be necessary\r\nto add hot water, but we should be careful in placing water troughs\r\nabout our barns to have them in such position that the sun may shine\r\nupon the water during the winter mornings. Water, even though it is thus\r\ncold, seldom produces serious trouble if the horse has not been deprived\r\nfor a too great length of time.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the purity of water, Smith, in his \"Veterinary Hygiene,\"\r\nclasses spring water, deep-well water, and upland surface water as\r\nwholesome; stored rain water and surface water from cultivated land as\r\nsuspicious; river water to which sewage gains access and shallow-well\r\nwater as dangerous. The water that is used so largely for drinking\r\npurposes for stock throughout some States can not but be impure. I refer\r\nto those sections where there is an impervious clay subsoil. It is the\r\ncustom to scoop, or hollow out, a large basin in the pastures. During\r\nrains these basins become filled with water. The clay subsoil, being\r\nalmost impervious, acts as a jug, and there is no escape for the water\r\nexcept by evaporation. Such water is stagnant, but would be kept\r\ncomparatively fresh by subsequent rains were it not for the fact that\r\nmuch organic matter is carried into it by surface drainage during each\r\nsucceeding storm. This organic matter soon undergoes decomposition, and,\r\nas the result, we find diseases of different kinds much more prevalent\r\nwhere this water is drunk than where the water supply is wholesome.\r\nAgain, it must not be lost sight of that stagnant surface water is much\r\nmore certainly contaminated than is running water by one diseased animal\r\nof the herd, thus endangering the remainder.\r\n\r\nThe chief impurities of water may be classified as organic and\r\ninorganic. The organic impurities are either animal or vegetable\r\nsubstances. The salts of the metals are the inorganic impurities. Lime\r\ncauses hardness of water, and occasion will be taken to speak of this\r\nwhen describing intestinal concretions. Salts of lead, iron, and copper\r\nare also frequently found in water; they also will be referred to.\r\n\r\nAbout the only examination of water that can be made by the average\r\nstock raiser is to observe its taste, color, smell, and clearness. Pure\r\nwater is clear and is without taste or smell.\r\n\r\nChemical and microscopic examination will frequently be necessary in\r\norder to detect the presence of certain poisons, bacteria, etc., and\r\ncan, of course, be conducted by experts only.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEDS AND FEEDING.\r\n\r\nIn this place one can not attempt anything like a comprehensive\r\ndiscussion of the subject of feeds and feeding, and I must content\r\nmyself with merely giving a few facts as to the different kinds of feed,\r\npreparation, digestibility, proper time of feeding, quality, and\r\nquantity. Improper feeding and watering will doubtless account for more\r\nthan one-half the digestive disorders met with in the horse, and hence\r\nthe reader can not fail to see how very important it is to have some\r\nproper ideas concerning these subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\nKINDS OF FEED.\r\n\r\nIn this country horses are fed chiefly upon hay, grass, corn fodder,\r\nroots, oats, corn, wheat, and rye. Many think that they could be fed on\r\nnothing else. Stewart, in \"The Stable Book,\" gives the following extract\r\nfrom Loudon's Encyclopedia of Agriculture, which is of interest at this\r\npoint:\r\n\r\n     In some sterile countries they [horses] are forced to subsist\r\n     on dried fish, and even on vegetable mold; in Arabia, on milk,\r\n     flesh balls, eggs, broth. In India horses are variously fed.\r\n     The native grasses are judged very nutritious. Few, perhaps no,\r\n     oats are grown; barley is rare, and not commonly given to\r\n     horses. In Bengal a vetch, something like the tare, is used. On\r\n     the western side of India a sort of pigeon pea, called gram\r\n     (_Cicer arietinum_), forms the ordinary food, with grass while\r\n     in season, and hay all the year round. Indian corn or rice is\r\n     seldom given. In the West Indies maize, guinea corn, sugar-corn\r\n     tops, and sometimes molasses are given. In the Mahratta country\r\n     salt, pepper, and other spices are made into balls, with flour\r\n     and butter, and these are supposed to produce animation and to\r\n     fine the coat. Broth made from sheep's head is sometimes given.\r\n     In France, Spain, and Italy, besides the grasses, the leaves of\r\n     limes, vines, the tops of acacia, and the seeds of the carob\r\n     tree are given to horses.\r\n\r\nWe can not, however, leave aside entirely here a consideration of the\r\ndigestibility of feeds; and by this we mean the readiness with which\r\nthey undergo those changes in the digestive canal that fit them for\r\nabsorption and deposition as integral parts of the animal economy.\r\n\r\nThe age and health of the animal will, of course, modify the\r\ndigestibility of feeds, as will also the manner and time of harvesting,\r\npreserving, and preparing.\r\n\r\nIn the horse digestion takes place principally in the intestines, and\r\nhere, as in all other animals and with all feeds, it is found that a\r\ncertain part only of the provender is digested; another portion is\r\nundigested. This proportion of digested and undigested feed must claim\r\npassing notice at least, for if the horse receives too much feed, or\r\nbulky feed containing much indigestible waste, a large portion of it\r\nmust pass out unused, entailing not only the loss of this unused feed,\r\nbut also calling for an unnecessary expenditure of vital force on the\r\npart of the digestive organs of the horse. It is thus that, in fact, too\r\nmuch feed may make an animal poor.\r\n\r\nIn selecting feed for the horse we should remember the anatomical\r\narrangement of the digestive organs, as well as the physiological\r\nfunctions performed by each one of them. Feeds must be wholesome, clean,\r\nand sweet, the hours of feeding regular, the mode of preparation found\r\nby practical experience to be the best must be adhered to, and\r\ncleanliness in preparation and administration must be observed.\r\n\r\nThe length of time occupied by stomach digestion in the horse varies\r\nwith the different feeds. Hay and straw pass out of the stomach more\r\nrapidly than oats. It would seem to follow, then, that oats should be\r\ngiven after hay, for if reversed the hay would cause the oats to be sent\r\nonward into the intestines before being fully acted upon by the stomach,\r\nand as a result produce indigestion. Experience confirms this. There is\r\nanother good reason why hay should be given first, particularly if the\r\nhorse is very hungry or if exhausted from overwork, namely, it requires\r\nmore time in mastication (insuring proper admixture of saliva) and can\r\nnot be bolted, as are the grains. In either instance water must not be\r\ngiven soon after feeding, as it washes or sluices the feed from the\r\nstomach before it is fitted for intestinal digestion.\r\n\r\nThe stomach begins to empty itself very soon after the commencement of\r\nfeeding, and continues rapidly while eating. Afterwards the passage is\r\nslower, and several hours are required before the stomach is entirely\r\nempty. The nature of the work required of the horse must guide us in the\r\nselection of his feed. Rapid or severe labor can not be performed on a\r\nfull stomach. For such labor feed must be given in small quantity and\r\nabout two hours before going to work. Even horses intended for slow work\r\nmust never be engorged with bulky, innutritious feed immediately before\r\ngoing to labor. The small stomach of the horse would seem to lead us to\r\nthe conclusion that he should be fed in small quantities and often,\r\nwhich, in reality, should be done. The disproportion between the size of\r\nthe stomach and the quantity of water drunk tells us plainly that the\r\nhorse should always be watered before feeding. One of the common errors\r\nof feeding, and the one that produces more digestive disorders than any\r\nother, is _to feed too soon after a hard day's work_. This must never be\r\ndone. If a horse is completely jaded, it will be found beneficial to\r\ngive him an alcoholic stimulant on going into the stable. A small\r\nquantity of hay may then be given, but his grain should be withheld for\r\none or two hours. These same remarks will apply with equal force to the\r\nhorse that for any reason has been fasting for a long time. After a\r\nfast, feed less than the horse would eat, for if allowed too much the\r\nstomach becomes engorged, its walls paralyzed, and \"colic\" is almost\r\nsure to follow. The horse should be fed three or four times a day. It\r\nwill not do to feed him entirely upon concentrated feed. Bulky feed must\r\nbe given to detain the grains in their passage through the intestinal\r\ntract; bulk also favors distention, and thus mechanically aids\r\nabsorption. For horses that do slow work the greater part of the time,\r\nchopped or cut hay fed with crushed oats, ground corn, etc., is the best\r\nmanner of feeding, as it gives the required bulk, saves time, and half\r\nthe labor of feeding.\r\n\r\nSudden changes of diet are always dangerous. When desirous of changing,\r\ndo so very gradually. If a horse is accustomed to oats, a sudden change\r\nto a full meal of corn will almost always sicken him. If we merely\r\nintend to increase the quantity of the _usual_ feed, this also must be\r\ndone gradually. The quantity of feed given must always be in proportion\r\nto the amount of labor to be performed. If a horse is to do a small\r\namount of work, or rest entirely from work for a few days, he should\r\nreceive a proportionate quantity of feed. If this should be observed\r\neven on Saturday night and Sunday, there would be fewer cases of \"Monday\r\nmorning sickness,\" such as colics and lymphangitis.\r\n\r\nFeeds should also be of a more laxative nature when the horse is to\r\nstand for several days.\r\n\r\nMUSTY OR MOLDY FEEDS.--Above all things, avoid feeding musty or moldy\r\nfeeds. They are very frequent causes of disease of different kinds. Lung\r\ntrouble, such as bronchitis and \"heaves,\" often follows their use. The\r\ndigestive organs always suffer from moldy or musty feeds. Musty hay is\r\ngenerally considered to produce disorder of the kidneys, and all know of\r\nthe danger from feeding pregnant animals upon ergotized grasses or\r\ngrains. It has often been said to produce that peculiar disease known\r\nvariously as cerebrospinal meningitis, putrid sore throat, or choking\r\ndistemper.\r\n\r\nHAY.--The best hay for horses is timothy. It should be about one year\r\nold, of a greenish color, crisp, clean, fresh, and possessing a sweet,\r\npleasant aroma. Even this good hay, if kept too long, loses part of its\r\nnourishment, and, while it may not be positively injurious, it is hard,\r\ndry, and indigestible. New hay is difficult to digest, produces much\r\nsalivation (slobbering), and occasional purging and irritation of the\r\nskin. If fed at all it should be mixed with old hay.\r\n\r\n_Second crop, or aftermath._--This is not considered good hay for\r\nhorses, but it is prized by some farmers as good for milch cows, the\r\nclaim being made that it increases the flow of milk. The value of hay\r\ndepends upon the time of cutting, as well as care in the curing. Hay\r\nshould be cut when in full flower, but before the seeds fall; if left\r\nlonger it becomes dry, woody, and lacks in nutrition. An essential\r\npoint in making hay is that when the crop is cut it should remain in the\r\nfield as short a time as possible. If left too long in the sun it loses\r\ncolor, flavor, and dries or wastes. Smith asserts that one hour more\r\nthan is necessary in the sun causes a loss of 15 to 20 per cent in the\r\nfeeding value of hay. It is impossible to state any fixed time that hay\r\nmust have to cure, this depending, of course, upon the weather,\r\nthickness of the crop, and many other circumstances; but it is well\r\nknown that in order to preserve the color and aroma of hay it should be\r\nturned or tedded frequently and cured as quickly as possible. On the\r\nother hand, hay spoils in the mow if harvested too green or when not\r\nsufficiently dried. Mow-burnt hay produces disorder of the kidneys and\r\nbowels and causes the horse to fall off in condition.\r\n\r\nThe average horse on grain should be allowed from 10 to 12 pounds of\r\ngood hay a day. It is a mistake of many to think that horses at light\r\nwork can be kept entirely on hay. Such horses soon become potbellied,\r\nfall off in flesh, and do not thrive. The same is true of colts; unless\r\nthe latter are fed with some grain they grow up to be long, lean, gawky\r\ncreatures, and never make so good horses as those accustomed to grain\r\nwith, or in addition to, their hay.\r\n\r\nSTRAW.--The straws are not extensively fed in this country, and when\r\nused at all they should be cut and mixed with hay and ground or crushed\r\ngrain. Wheat, rye, and oat straw are the ones most used; of these, oat\r\nstraw is most easily digested and contains the most nourishment. Pea and\r\nbean straw are occasionally fed to horses, the pea being preferable,\r\naccording to most writers.\r\n\r\nCHAFF.--Wheat and rye chaff should never be used as a feed for horses.\r\nThe beards frequently become lodged in the mouth or throat and are\r\nproductive of more or less serious trouble. In the stomach and\r\nintestines they often serve as the nucleus of the \"soft concretions,\"\r\nwhich are to be described when treating of obstructions of the digestive\r\ntract.\r\n\r\nOat chaff, if fed in small quantities and mixed with cut hay or corn\r\nfodder, is very much relished by horses. It is not to be given in large\r\nquantities, as I have repeatedly witnessed a troublesome and sometimes\r\nfatal diarrhea following the practice of allowing horses or cattle free\r\naccess to a pile of oat chaff.\r\n\r\nGRAINS.--Oats take precedence of all grains as a feed for horses, as the\r\ningredients necessary for the complete nutrition of the body exist in\r\nthem in the best proportions. Oats are, besides, more easily digested\r\nand a larger proportion absorbed and converted into the various tissues\r\nof the body. Care must be taken in selecting oats. According to Stewart,\r\nthe best oats are one year old, plump, short, hard, clean, bright, and\r\nsweet. New oats are indigestible. Kiln-dried oats are to be refused, as\r\na rule, for even though originally good this drying process injures\r\nthem. Oats that have sprouted or fermented are injurious and should\r\nnever be fed. Oats are to be given either whole or crushed--whole in the\r\nmajority of instances; crushed to old horses and those having defective\r\nteeth. Horses that bolt their feed are also best fed upon crushed oats\r\nand out of a manger large enough to permit of spreading the grain in a\r\nthin layer.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the allowance of hay above mentioned, the average horse\r\nrequires about 12 quarts of good oats daily. The best oats are those cut\r\nabout one week before they are fully ripe. Not only is the grain richer\r\nin nutritive materials at this time, but there is also less waste from\r\n\"scattering\" than if left to become dead ripe. Moldy oats, like hay and\r\nstraw, not only produce serious digestive disorders but have been the\r\nundoubted cause of outbreaks of that dread disease in horses, already\r\nreferred to, characterized by inability to eat or drink, sudden\r\nparalysis, and death.\r\n\r\nWHEAT AND RYE.--These grains are not to be used for horses except in\r\nsmall quantities, bruised or crushed, and fed mixed with other grains or\r\nhay. If fed alone, in any considerable quantities, they are almost\r\ncertain to produce digestive disorders, laminitis (founder), and similar\r\ntroubles. They should never constitute more than one-fourth the grain\r\nallowance, and should always be ground or crushed.\r\n\r\nBRAN.--The bran of wheat is the one most used, and its value as a\r\nfeeding stuff is variously estimated. It is not to be depended upon if\r\ngiven alone, but may be fed with other grains. It serves to keep the\r\nbowels open. Sour bran is not to be given, for it disorders the stomach\r\nand intestines and may even produce serious results.\r\n\r\nMAIZE (CORN).--This grain is not suitable as an exclusive feed for young\r\nhorses, as it is deficient in salts. It is fed whole or ground. Corn on\r\nthe cob is commonly used for horses affected with \"lampas.\" If the corn\r\nis old and is to be fed in this manner it should be soaked in pure,\r\nclean water for 10 or 12 hours. Corn is better given ground, and fed in\r\nquantities of from 1 to 2 quarts at a meal, mixed with crushed oats or\r\nwheat bran. Great care should be taken in giving corn to a horse that is\r\nnot accustomed to its use. It must be commenced in small quantities and\r\nvery gradually increased. I know of no grain more liable to produce what\r\nis called acute indigestion than corn if these directions are not\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nLINSEED.--Ground linseed is occasionally fed with other feeds to keep\r\nthe bowels open and to improve the condition of the skin. It is of\r\nparticular service during convalescence, when the bowels are sluggish in\r\ntheir action. Linseed tea is very often given in irritable or inflamed\r\nconditions of the digestive organs.\r\n\r\nPOTATOES.--These are used as an article of feed for the horse in many\r\nsections. If fed raw and in large quantities they often produce\r\nindigestion. Their digestibility is increased by steaming or boiling.\r\nThey possess, in common with other roots, slight laxative properties.\r\n\r\nBEETS.--These are not much used as feed for horses.\r\n\r\nCARROTS.--These make a most excellent feed, particularly during\r\nsickness. They improve the appetite and slightly increase the action of\r\nthe bowels and kidneys. They possess also certain alterative properties,\r\nmaking the coat smooth and glossy. Some veterinary writers assert that\r\nchronic cough is cured by giving carrots for some time. The roots may be\r\nconsidered, then, as an adjunct to the regular regimen, and if fed in\r\nsmall quantities are highly beneficial.\r\n\r\nGRASSES.--Grass is the natural food of horses. It is composed of a great\r\nvariety of plants, differing widely as to the amount of nourishment\r\ncontained, some being almost entirely without value and only eaten when\r\nnothing else is obtainable, while others are positively injurious, or\r\neven poisonous. None of the grasses are sufficient to keep the horse in\r\ncondition for work. Horses thus fed are \"soft,\" sweat easily, purge, and\r\nsoon tire on the road or when at hard work. Grass is indispensable to\r\ngrowing stock, and there is little or no doubt that it acts as an\r\nalterative when given to horses accustomed to grain and hay. It must be\r\ngiven to such horses in small quantities at first. The stomach and\r\nintestines undergo rest, and recuperate if the horse is turned to grass\r\nfor a time each year. It is also certain that during febrile diseases\r\ngrass acts almost as a medicine, lessening the fever and favoring\r\nrecovery. Wounds heal more rapidly than when the horse is on grain, and\r\nsome chronic disorders (chronic cough, for instance) disappear entirely\r\nwhen at grass. In my experience, grass does more good when the horse\r\ncrops it himself. This may be due to the sense of freedom he enjoys at\r\npasture, to the rest to his feet and limbs, and for many other similar\r\nreasons. When cut for him it should be fed fresh or when but slightly\r\nwilted.\r\n\r\nSILAGE.--Regarding silage as a feed for horses, Rommel in Farmers'\r\nBulletin 578 writes as follows:\r\n\r\n     Silage has not been generally fed to horses, partly on account\r\n     of a certain amount of danger which attends its use for this\r\n     purpose, but still more, perhaps, on account of prejudice. In\r\n     many cases horses have been killed by eating moldy silage, and\r\n     the careless person who fed it at once blamed the silage\r\n     itself, rather than his own carelessness and the mold which\r\n     really was the cause of the trouble. Horses are peculiarly\r\n     susceptible to the effects of molds, and under certain\r\n     conditions certain molds grow on silage which are deadly\r\n     poisons to both horses and mules. Molds must have air to grow,\r\n     and therefore silage which is packed air-tight and fed out\r\n     rapidly will not become moldy. If the feeder watches the silage\r\n     carefully as the weather warms up he can soon detect the\r\n     presence of mold. When mold appears, feeding to horses or mules\r\n     should stop immediately.\r\n\r\n     It is also unsafe to feed horses frozen silage on account of\r\n     the danger of colic. * * *\r\n\r\n     To summarize, silage is safe to feed to horses and mules only\r\n     when it is made from fairly mature corn, properly stored in the\r\n     silo. When it is properly stored and is not allowed to mold, no\r\n     feed exceeds it as a cheap winter ration. It is most valuable\r\n     for horses and mules which are not at heavy work, such as brood\r\n     mares and work horses during the slack season. With plenty of\r\n     grain on the cornstalks, horses will keep in good condition on\r\n     a ration of 20 pounds of silage and 10 pounds of hay for each\r\n     1,000 pounds of live weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF FEEDS.\r\n\r\nFeed is prepared for any of the following reasons: To render it more\r\neasily eaten; to make it more digestible; to economize in amount; to\r\ngive it some new property; and to preserve it. We have already spoken of\r\nthe preparation of drying, and need not revert to this again, as it only\r\nserves to preserve the different feeds. Drying does, however, change\r\nsome of the properties of feed, _i. e._, removes the laxative tendency\r\nof most of them.\r\n\r\nThe different grains are more easily eaten when ground, crushed, or even\r\nboiled. Rye or wheat should never be given whole, and even of corn it is\r\nfound that there is less waste when ground, and, in common with all\r\nother grains, it is more easily digested than when fed whole.\r\n\r\nHay and fodder are economized when cut in short pieces. Not only will\r\nthe horse eat the necessary quantity in a shorter time, but it will be\r\nfound that there is less waste, and the mastication of the grains (whole\r\nor crushed) fed with them is insured.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to those horses that bolt their feed,\r\nand we need only remark here that the consequences of such ravenous\r\neating may be prevented if the grains are fed with cut hay, straw, or\r\nfodder. Long or uncut hay should also be fed, even though a certain\r\nquantity of hay or straw is cut and fed mixed with grain.\r\n\r\nOne objection to feeding cut hay mixed with ground or crushed grains,\r\nand wetted, must not be overlooked during the hot months. Such feed is\r\nliable to undergo fermentation if not fed directly after it is mixed;\r\neven the mixing trough, unless frequently scalded and cleaned, becomes\r\nsour and enough of its scrapings are given with the feed to produce\r\nflatulent (wind) colic. A small quantity of salt should always be mixed\r\nwith such feed. Bad hay should never be cut simply because it insures a\r\ngreater consumption of it; bad feeds are dear at any price, and should\r\nnever be fed.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of boiling roots has been mentioned. Not only does this\r\nrender them less liable to produce digestive disorders, but it also\r\nmakes them clean. Boiling or steaming grains is to be recommended when\r\nthe teeth are poor, or when the digestive organs are weak.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE TEETH.\r\n\r\n_Dentition._--This covers the period during which the young horse is\r\ncutting his teeth--from birth to the age of 5 years. With the horse more\r\ndifficulty is experienced in cutting the second or permanent teeth than\r\nwith the first or milk teeth. There is a tendency among farmers and many\r\nveterinarians to pay too little attention to the teeth of young horses.\r\nPercivall relates an instance illustrative of this that is best told in\r\nhis own words:\r\n\r\n     I was requested to give my opinion concerning a horse, then in\r\n     his fifth year, who had fed so sparingly for the last\r\n     fortnight, and so rapidly declined in condition in consequence,\r\n     that his owner, a veterinary surgeon, was under no light\r\n     apprehensions about his life. He had himself examined his mouth\r\n     without having discovered any defect or disease, though another\r\n     veterinary surgeon was of opinion that the difficulty or\r\n     inability manifested in mastication, and the consequent\r\n     cudding, arose from preternatural bluntness of the surfaces of\r\n     the molar teeth, which were, in consequence, filed, but without\r\n     beneficial result. It was after this that I saw the horse, and\r\n     I confess I was, at my first examination, quite as much at a\r\n     loss to offer any satisfactory interpretation as others had\r\n     been. While meditating, however, after my inspection, on the\r\n     apparently extraordinary nature of the case, it struck me that\r\n     I had not seen the tusks. I went back into the stable and\r\n     discovered two little tumors, red and hard, in the situation of\r\n     the inferior tusks, which, when pressed, gave the animal\r\n     insufferable pain. I instantly took out my pocketknife and made\r\n     crucial incisions through them both, down to the coming teeth,\r\n     from which moment the horse recovered his appetite and, by\r\n     degrees, his wonted condition.\r\n\r\nThe mouths of young horses should be examined from time to time to see\r\nwhether one or more of the milk teeth are not remaining too long,\r\ncausing the second teeth to grow in crooked, in which case the first\r\nteeth should be removed with the forceps.\r\n\r\n_Irregularities of teeth._--There is a fashion of late years, especially\r\nin large cities, to have horses' teeth regularly \"floated,\" or \"rasped,\"\r\nby \"veterinary dentists.\" In some instances this is very beneficial,\r\nwhile in most cases it is entirely unnecessary. From the character of\r\nthe feed, the rubbing, or grinding, surface of the horse's teeth should\r\nbe rough. Still, we must remember that the upper jaw is somewhat wider\r\nthan the lower, and that, from the fact of the teeth not being perfectly\r\napposed, a sharp ridge is left unworn on the inside of the lower molars\r\nand on the outside of the upper, which may excoriate the tongue or\r\ncheeks to a considerable extent. This condition may readily be felt by\r\nthe hand, and these sharp ridges when found should be rasped down by a\r\nguarded rasp. In some instances the first or last molar tooth is\r\nunnaturally long, owing to the fact that its fellow in the opposite jaw\r\nhas been lost or does not close perfectly against it. Should it be the\r\nlast molar that is thus elongated, it will require the aid of the\r\nveterinary surgeon, who has the necessary forceps or chisel for cutting\r\nit. The front molar may be rasped down, if much patience is taken. In\r\ndecay of the teeth it is quite common to find the tooth corresponding to\r\nthe decayed one on the opposite jaw very much elongated, sometimes to\r\nsuch an extent that the mouth can not be perfectly closed. Such teeth\r\nmust also be shortened by the tooth forceps, chisel, tooth saw, or rasp.\r\nIn all instances in which horses \"quid\" their feed, if they are\r\nslobbering, or evince pain in mastication, shown by holding the head to\r\none side while chewing, the teeth should be carefully examined. Horses\r\nwhose teeth have unduly sharp edges are liable to drive badly; they pull\r\nto one side, do not bear on the bit, or bear on too hard and \"big,\" toss\r\nthe head, and start suddenly when a tender spot is touched. If, as is\r\nmostly the case, all the symptoms are referable to sharp corners or\r\nprojections, these must be removed by the rasp. If decayed teeth ere\r\nfound, or other serious difficulty detected, or if the cause of the\r\nannoying symptoms is not discovered, an expert should be called.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV.\r\n\r\nAGE OF HORSES AS INDICATED BY TEETH.\r\n\r\nLongitudinal section of left central lower incisor and cross sections of\r\nsame tooth showing table surfaces as they appear at the ages of 3, 5, 7,\r\n9, 15, 20 and 25 years. _C_, Cement; _D_, Dentine; _E_, Enamel; _I_,\r\nInfundibulum; _K_, Cup; _P_, Pulp Cavity; _S_, Star.]\r\n\r\n_Toothache._--This is rare in the horse and is mostly witnessed when\r\nthere is decay of a tooth or inflammation about its root. Toothache is\r\nto be discovered in the horse by the pain expressed by him while feeding\r\nor drinking cold water. I have seen horses, affected with toothache,\r\nthat would suddenly stop chewing, throw the head to one side, and\r\nslightly open the mouth. They behave as though some sharp body had\r\npunctured the mouth. If upon examination, no foreign body is found, we\r\nmust then carefully examine each tooth. If this can not be done with the\r\nhand in the mouth, we can, in most instances, discover the aching tooth\r\nby pressing each tooth from without. By tapping the teeth in succession\r\nwith a hard object, such as a small hammer, the one that is tender may\r\nbe identified. The horse will flinch when the sore tooth is pressed or\r\ntapped upon. In most cases there is nothing to be done but extract the\r\ndecayed tooth, and this, of course, is to be attempted by the\r\nveterinarian only.\r\n\r\n_Deformity._--There is a deformity, known as parrot-mouth, that\r\ninterferes with prehension, mastication, and, indirectly, with\r\ndigestion. The upper incisors project in front of and beyond the lower\r\nones. The teeth of both jaws become unusually long, as they are not worn\r\ndown by friction. Such horses experience much difficulty in grazing.\r\nLittle can be done except to examine the teeth occasionally, and if\r\nthose of the lower jaw become so long that they bruise the \"bars\" of the\r\nupper jaw, they must be shortened by the rasp or saw. Horses with this\r\ndeformity should never be left entirely at pasture.\r\n\r\nThe method of determining the age of a horse by the teeth is illustrated\r\nin Plate IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE MOUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAMPAS.\r\n\r\nLampas is the name given to a swelling of the mucous membrane covering\r\nthe hard palate and projecting in a more or less prominent ridge\r\nimmediately behind the upper incisors. The hard palate is composed of\r\nspongy tissue that fills with blood when the horse is feeding, which\r\ncauses the ridges to become prominent, and they then help to keep feed\r\nfrom dropping from the mouth. This swelling is entirely natural and\r\noccurs in every healthy horse. Where there is some irritation in the\r\nmouth, as in stomatitis or during teething, the prominence of the hard\r\npalate may persist, owing to the increased blood supply. In such cases\r\nthe cause of the irritation should be nought for and removed. By way of\r\ndirect treatment, slight scarification is the most that will be\r\nrequired. Burning the lampas is barbarous and injurious, and it should\r\nnever be tolerated.\r\n\r\nIt is a quite common opinion among owners of horses and stablemen that\r\nlampas is a disease that very frequently exists. In fact whenever a\r\nhorse fails to eat, and if he does not exhibit very marked symptoms of a\r\nsevere illness, they say at once \"he has the lampas.\" It is almost\r\nimpossible to convince them to the contrary; yet it is not the case. It\r\nmay be put down, then, as an affliction of the stable-man's imagination\r\nrather than of the horse's mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOMATITIS.\r\n\r\nStomatitis is an inflammation of the mucous membrane lining the mouth\r\nand is produced by irritating medicines, feeds, or other substances. The\r\nsymptoms are swelling of the mouth, which is also hot and painful to the\r\ntouch; there is a copious discharge of saliva; the mucous membrane is\r\nreddened, and in some cases vesicles or ulcers in the mouth are\r\nobserved. The treatment is simple, soft feed alone often being all that\r\nis necessary. A bucket of fresh, cold water should be kept constantly in\r\nthe manger so that the horse may drink or rinse his mouth at will. In\r\nsome instances, it may be advisable to use a wash of chlorate of potash,\r\nborax, or alum, about one-half ounce to a pint of water. Hay, straw, or\r\noats should not be fed unless steamed or boiled. A form of contagious\r\nstomatitis, characterized by the formation within the mouth of small\r\nvesicles, or blisters, sometimes occurs. In this disease the horse\r\nshould be isolated from other horses, and his stall, especially the feed\r\nbox, and his bit should be disinfected.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOSSITIS (INFLAMMATION OF THE TONGUE).\r\n\r\nGlossitis, or inflammation of the tongue, is very similar to stomatitis,\r\nand mostly exists with it and is due to the same causes. Injuries to the\r\ntongue may produce this simple inflammation of its covering membrane,\r\nor, if severe, may produce lesions much more extensive, such as\r\nlacerations, abscesses, etc. These latter would require surgical\r\ntreatment, but for the simpler forms of inflammation of the tongue the\r\ntreatment recommended for stomatitis should be followed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALIVATION (PTYALISM).\r\n\r\nPtyalism, or salivation, consists in an abnormal and excessive secretion\r\nof saliva. This is often seen as a symptom of irregular teeth;\r\ninflammation of the mouth or tongue, or of the use of such medicines as\r\nlobelia, mercury, and many others. Some feeds, such as clover, and\r\nparticularly second crop, produce it; foreign bodies, such as nails,\r\nwheat chaff, and corncobs becoming lodged in the mouth, also are causes.\r\nIf the cause is removed no further attention is necessary, as a rule.\r\nAstringent washes may be applied to the mouth as a gargle or by means of\r\na sponge.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHARYNGITIS.\r\n\r\nPharyngitis is an inflammation of the mucous membrane lining of the\r\npharynx or throat. It rarely exists unless accompanied with stomatitis\r\nor laryngitis, especially the latter. In those rare instances in which\r\nthe inflammation is mostly confined to the pharynx are noticed febrile\r\nsymptoms--difficulty of swallowing either liquids or solids; there is\r\nbut little cough except when trying to swallow; there is no soreness on\r\npressure over larynx (head of the windpipe). Increased flow of saliva,\r\ndifficulty of swallowing liquids in particular, and cough only when\r\nattempting to swallow, are the symptoms best marked in pharyngitis. In\r\nsome cases the throat becomes gangrenous and the disease ends in death.\r\nFor treatment a wet sheet should be wrapped around the throat and\r\ncovered with rubber sheeting and a warm blanket. This should be changed\r\nthree times daily; or the region of the throat may be rubbed with\r\nmercurial ointment twice daily until the skin becomes irritated, but no\r\nlonger; chlorate of potash may be given in 2-dram doses four times\r\ndaily, mixed with flaxseed meal or licorice-root powder and honey, as an\r\nelectuary. Soft feeds should be given, and fresh water should be\r\nconstantly before the horse.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARALYSIS OF THE PHARYNX.\r\n\r\nParalysis of the pharynx, or, as it is commonly called, \"paralysis of\r\nthe throat,\" is a rare but very serious disease. The symptoms are as\r\nfollows: The horse will constantly try to eat or drink, but will be\r\nunable to do so; if water is offered him from a pail he will apparently\r\ndrink with avidity, but the quantity of water in the pail will remain\r\nabout the same; he will continue by the hour to try to drink; if he can\r\nget any fluid into the back part of the mouth it will come out at once\r\nthrough the nose. Feeds also return through the nose, or are dropped\r\nfrom the mouth, quidded. An examination of the mouth by inserting the\r\nhand fails to find any obstruction or any abnormal condition. These\r\ncases go on from bad to worse; the horse constantly and rapidly loses in\r\ncondition, becomes very much emaciated, the eyes are hollow and\r\nlusterless, and death occurs from inanition.\r\n\r\nTreatment is very unsatisfactory. A severe blister should be applied\r\nbehind and under the jaw; the mouth is to be frequently swabbed out with\r\nalum or chlorate of potash, 1 ounce to a pint of water, by means of a\r\nsponge fastened to the end of a stick. Strychnia may be given in 1-grain\r\ndoses two or three times a day.\r\n\r\nThis disease may be mistaken at times for foreign bodies in the mouth or\r\nfor the so-called cerebrospinal meningitis. It is to be distinguished\r\nfrom the former, upon a careful examination of the mouth, by the absence\r\nof any offending body and by the flabby feel of the mouth, and from the\r\nlatter by the animal appearing in perfect health in every particular\r\nexcept this inability to eat or drink.\r\n\r\n\r\nABSCESSES.\r\n\r\nAbscesses sometimes form back of the pharynx and give rise to symptoms\r\nresembling those of laryngitis or distemper. Interference with breathing\r\nthat is of recent origin and progression, without any observable\r\nswelling or soreness about the throat, will make one suspect the\r\nformation of an abscess in this location. But little can be done in the\r\nway of treatment, save to hurry the ripening of the abscess and its\r\ndischarge by steaming with hops, hay, or similar substances and by\r\npoulticing the throat. The operation for opening an abscess in this\r\nregion necessitates an intimate knowledge of the complex anatomy of the\r\nthroat region.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE ESOPHAGUS OR GULLET.\r\n\r\nIt is rare to find diseases of this organ, except as a result of the\r\nintroduction of foreign bodies too large to pass or to the administering\r\nof irritating medicines. In the administration of irritant or caustic\r\nmedicines great care should be taken that they be thoroughly diluted. If\r\nthis is not done, erosions and ulcerations of the throat ensue, and this\r\nagain is prone to be followed by constriction (narrowing) of the gullet.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOKING.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical trouble of choking is quite common. It may occur when the\r\nanimal is suddenly startled while eating apples or roots, and we should\r\nbe careful never to approach suddenly or put a dog after horses or cows\r\nthat are feeding upon such substances. If left alone these animals very\r\nrarely attempt to swallow the object until it is sufficiently\r\nmasticated.\r\n\r\nChoking also arises from feeding oats in a deep, narrow manger to such\r\nhorses as eat very greedily or bolt their feed. Wheat chaff is also a\r\nfrequent cause of choke. This accident may result from the attempts to\r\nforce eggs down without breaking or from giving balls that are too large\r\nor not of the proper shape.\r\n\r\nWhatever object causes the choking, it may lodge in the upper part of\r\nthe esophagus, at its middle portion, or close to the stomach, giving\r\nrise to the designations of pharyngeal, cervical, and thoracic choke. In\r\nsome cases where the original obstruction is low we find all that part\r\nof the gullet above it to be distended with feed.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms vary somewhat according to the position of the\r\nbody causing choke. In pharyngeal choke the object is lodged in the\r\nupper portion of the esophagus. The horse will present symptoms of great\r\ndistress, hurried breathing, frequent cough, excessive flow of saliva,\r\nsweating, trembling, or stamping with the fore feet. The abdomen rapidly\r\ndistends with gas. The diagnosis is completed by manipulating the upper\r\npart of the throat from without and by the introduction of the hand into\r\nthe back part of the mouth, finding the body lodged here. In cervical\r\nchoke (where the obstruction is situated at any point between the\r\nthroatlatch and the shoulder) the protrusion caused by the object can be\r\nseen and the object can be felt. The symptoms here are not so severe;\r\nthe horse will be seen occasionally to draw himself up, arch his neck,\r\nand make retching movements as though he wished to vomit. The abdomen\r\nmay be tympanitic. Should there be any question as to the trouble, a\r\nconclusion may be reached by pouring water into the throat from a\r\nbottle. If the obstruction is complete, by standing on the left side of\r\nthe horse and watching the course of the esophagus, you can see the\r\ngullet, just above the windpipe, become distended with each bottle of\r\nwater. This is not always a sure test, as the obstruction may be an\r\nangular body, in which case liquids would pass it. Solids taken would\r\nshow in these cases; solids should not, however, be given, as they serve\r\nto increase the trouble by rendering the removal of the body more\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nIn thoracic choke the symptoms are less severe. Feed or water may be\r\nejected through the nose or mouth after the animal has taken a few\r\nswallows. There will be some symptoms of distress, fullness of the\r\nabdomen, cough, and occasionally retching movements. Sometimes a choking\r\nhorse is heard to emit groans. The facial expression always denotes\r\ngreat anxiety and the eyes are bloodshot. The diagnosis is complete if,\r\nupon passing the probang (a flexible tube made for this purpose), an\r\nobstruction is encountered.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--If the choke is at the beginning of the gullet\r\n(pharyngeal) an effort must be made to remove the obstacle through the\r\nmouth. A mouthgag, or speculum, is to be introduced into the mouth to\r\nprotect the hand and arm of the operator. Then, while an assistant, with\r\nhis hands grasped tightly _behind_ the object, presses it upward and\r\nforward with all his force, the operator must pass his hand into the\r\nmouth until he can seize the obstruction and draw it outward. This mode\r\nof procedure must not be abandoned with the first failure, as by\r\ncontinued efforts we may get the obstacle farther toward the mouth. If\r\nwe fail with the hand, forceps may be introduced through the mouth and\r\nthe object seized when it is just beyond the reach of the fingers.\r\nShould our efforts entirely fail, we must then endeavor to force the\r\nobstruction downward by means of the probang. This instrument, which is\r\nof such signal service in removing choke in cattle, is decidedly more\r\ndangerous to use for the horse, and I can not pass this point without a\r\nword of caution to those who have been known to introduce into the\r\nhorse's throat such objects as whipstalks, shovel handles, etc. These\r\nare always dangerous, and more than one horse has been killed by such\r\nbarbarous treatment.\r\n\r\nIn cervical as well as in thoracic choke we must first of all endeavor\r\nto soften or lubricate the obstruction by pouring oil or mucilaginous\r\ndrinks down the gullet. After this has been done endeavor to move the\r\nobject by gentle manipulations with the hands. If choked with oats or\r\nchaff (and these are the objects that most frequently produce choke in\r\nthe horse), begin by gently squeezing the lower portion of the impacted\r\nmass and endeavor to work it loose a little at a time. This is greatly\r\nfavored at times if we apply hot fomentations immediately about the\r\nobstruction. Persist in these efforts for at least an hour before\r\ndeciding to resort to other and more dangerous modes of treatment. If\r\nunsuccessful, however, the probang may be used. In the absence of the\r\nregular instrument, a piece of inch hose 6 feet long or a piece of new\r\nthree-quarter-inch manila rope well wrapped at the end with cotton twine\r\nand thoroughly greased with tallow should be used. The mouth is to be\r\nkept open by a gag of wood or iron and the head slightly raised and\r\nextended. The probang is then to be carefully guided by the hand into\r\nthe upper part of the gullet and gently forced downward until the\r\nobstruction is reached. Pressure must then be gradual and firm. At first\r\ntoo much force should not be used, or the esophagus will be ruptured.\r\nFirm, gentle pressure should be kept up until the object is felt to\r\nmove, after which it should be followed rapidly to the stomach. If this\r\nmode of treatment is unsuccessful, a veterinarian or a physician should\r\nbe called, who can remove the object by cutting down upon it. This\r\nshould scarcely be attempted by a novice, as a knowledge of the anatomy\r\nof the parts is essential to avoid cutting the large artery, vein, and\r\nnerve that are closely related to the esophagus in its cervical\r\nportion.\r\n\r\nThoracic choke can be treated only by means of the introduction of oils\r\nand mucilaginous drinks and the careful use of the probang.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRICTURE OF THE ESOPHAGUS.\r\n\r\nThis is due to corrosive medicines, previous choking (accompanied with\r\nlacerations, which, in healing, narrow the passage), or pressure on the\r\ngullet by tumors. In the majority of cases of stricture, dilatation of\r\nthe gullet in front of the constricted portion soon occurs. This\r\ndilatation is the result of the frequent accumulation of solid feed\r\nabove the constriction. Little can be done in either of these instances\r\nexcept to give sloppy or liquid feed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSACULAR DILATATION OF THE ESOPHAGUS.\r\n\r\nThis follows choking, and is due to stretching or rupture of the\r\nmuscular coat of the gullet, allowing the internal, or mucous, coat to\r\nprotrude through the lacerated muscular walls. Such a dilatation, or\r\npouch, may gradually enlarge from the frequent imprisonment of feed.\r\nWhen liquids are taken, the solid materials are partially washed out of\r\nthe pouch.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms are as follows: The horse is able to swallow a few\r\nmouthfuls without apparent difficulty; then he will stop feeding, paw,\r\ncontract the muscles of his neck, and eject a portion of the feed\r\nthrough his nose or mouth, or it will gradually work down to the\r\nstomach. As the dilatation thus empties itself the symptoms gradually\r\nsubside, only to reappear when he has again taken solid feed. Liquids\r\npass without any, or but little, inconvenience. Should this dilatation\r\nexist in the cervical region, surgical interference may sometimes prove\r\neffectual; if in the thoracic portion, nothing can be done, and the\r\npatient rapidly passes from hand to hand by \"swapping,\" until, at no\r\ndistant date, the contents of the sac become too firm to be dislodged as\r\nheretofore, and the animal succumbs.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE STOMACH AND INTESTINES.\r\n\r\nAs a rule it is most difficult to distinguish between diseases of the\r\nstomach and of the intestines of the horse. The reason for this is that\r\nthe stomach is relatively small. It lies away from the abdominal wall,\r\nand so pressure from without can not be brought to bear upon it to\r\nreveal sensitiveness or pain. Nor does enlargement, or distention, of\r\nthe stomach produce visible alteration in the form of the abdomen of the\r\nhorse. Moreover, it is a rule to which there are few exceptions, that an\r\nirritant or cause of disease of the stomach acts likewise upon the\r\nintestines, so that it is customary to find them similarly deranged. For\r\nthese reasons it is logical to discuss together the diseases of the\r\nstomach and intestines and to point out such localizations in one organ\r\nor another as are of importance in recognizing and treating the diseases\r\nof the digestive organs of the horse.\r\n\r\nIt should be understood that gastritis signifies an inflammation of the\r\nstomach and enteritis an inflammation of the intestines. The two terms\r\nmay be used together to signify a disease of the stomach and intestines,\r\nas gastro-enteritis.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLIC.\r\n\r\nThe disease of the horse that is most frequently met with is what is\r\ntermed \"colic,\" and many are the remedies that are reputed to be \"sure\r\ncures\" for this disease. Let us discover, then, what the word \"colic\"\r\nmeans. This term is applied loosely to almost all diseases of the organs\r\nof the abdomen that are accompanied with pain. If the horse evinces\r\nabdominal pain, he probably will be considered as suffering with colic,\r\nno matter whether the difficulty is a cramp of the bowel, an internal\r\nhernia, overloading of the stomach, or a painful disease of the bladder\r\nor liver. Since these conditions differ so much in their causation and\r\ntheir nature, it is manifestly absurd to treat them alike and to expect\r\nthe same drugs or procedures to relieve them all. Therefore, it is\r\nimportant that, so far as possible, the various diseased states that are\r\nso roughly classed together as colic shall be separated and\r\nindividualized in order that appropriate treatments may be prescribed.\r\nWith this object in view, colics will be considered under the following\r\nheadings: (1) Engorgement colic, (2) obstruction colic, (3) flatulent or\r\ntympanitic colic, (4) spasmodic colic. Worm colic is discussed under the\r\nheading \"Gastrointestinal parasites,\" page 90.\r\n\r\nThe general symptoms of abdominal pain, and therefore of colic, are\r\nrestlessness, cessation of whatever the horse is about, lying down,\r\nlooking around toward the flank, kicking with the hind feet upward and\r\nforward toward the belly, jerky switching of the tail, stretching as\r\nthough to urinate, frequent change of position, and groaning. In the\r\nmore intense forms the horse plunges about, throws himself, rolls,\r\nassumes unnatural positions, as sitting on the haunches, and grunts\r\nloudly. Usually the pain is not constant, and during the intermissions\r\nthe horse may eat and appear normal. During the period of pain sweat is\r\npoured out freely. Sometimes the horse moves constantly in a circle. The\r\nrespirations are accelerated, and usually there is no fever.\r\n\r\nENGORGEMENT COLIC.--This form of colic consists in an overloading of the\r\nstomach with feed. The horse may have been overfed or the feed may have\r\ncollected in the stomach through failure of this organ to digest it and\r\npass it backward into the intestines. Even a normal quantity of feed\r\nthat the horse is unaccustomed to may cause disease. Hence a sudden\r\nchange of feed may produce engorgement colic. Continued full rations\r\nwhile the horse is resting for a day or two or working too soon after\r\nfeeding may serve as a cause. New oats, corn, or hay, damaged feed, or\r\nthat which is difficult of digestion, such as barley or beans, may\r\nincite engorgement colic. This disease may result from having fed the\r\nhorse twice by error or from its having escaped and taken an\r\nunrestricted meal from the grain bin. Ground feeds that pack together,\r\nmaking a sort of dough, may cause engorgement colic if they are not\r\nmixed with cut hay. Greedy eaters are predisposed to this disease.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The horse shows the general signs of abdominal pain, which\r\nmay be long continued or of short duration. Retching or vomiting\r\nmovements are made; these are shown by labored breathing, upturned upper\r\nlip, contraction of the flank, active motion at the throat, and drawing\r\nin of the nose toward the breast, causing high arching of the neck. The\r\nhorse may assume a sitting position like a dog. At times the pain is\r\nvery great and the horse makes the most violent movements, as though\r\nmad. At other times there is profound mental depression, the horse\r\nstanding in a sleepy, or dazed, way, with the head down, the eyes\r\nclosed, and leaning his head against the manger or wall. There is,\r\nduring the struggles, profuse perspiration. Following retching, gas may\r\nescape from the mouth, and this may be followed by a sour froth and some\r\nstomach contents. The horse can not vomit except when the stomach is\r\nviolently stretched, and, if the accumulation of feed or gas is great\r\nenough to stretch the stomach so that vomiting is possible, it may be\r\ngreat enough to rupture that organ. So it happens not infrequently that\r\na horse dies from ruptured stomach after vomiting. After the stomach\r\nruptures, however, vomiting is impossible. The death rate in this form\r\nof colic is high.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The bowels should be stimulated to contraction by the use\r\nof clysters of large quantities of water and of glycerin. Veterinarians\r\nuse hypodermic injections of eserin or arecolin or intravenous\r\ninjections of barium chlorid, but they must be employed with great\r\ncaution. It is not profitable to give remedies by the stomach, for they\r\ncan not be absorbed. But small doses of morphin (5 grains) or of the\r\nfluid extract of Indian hemp (2 drams) may be placed in the mouth and\r\nare absorbed in part, at least, without passing to the stomach. These\r\ndrugs lessen pain and thus help to overcome the violent movements that\r\nare dangerous, because they may be the means of causing rupture of the\r\ndiaphragm or stomach. If facilities are available, relief may be\r\nafforded by passing an esophageal tube through which some of the gaseous\r\nand liquid contents of the stomach may escape.\r\n\r\n_Rupture of the stomach._--This mostly occurs as a result of engorged or\r\ntympanitic stomach (engorgement colic) and from the horse violently\r\nthrowing himself when so affected. It may result from disease of the\r\ncoats of the stomach, gastritis, stones (calculi), tumors, or anything\r\nthat closes the opening of the stomach into the intestines, and very\r\nviolent pulling or jumping immediately after the animal has eaten\r\nheartily of bulky feed. These or similar causes may lead this accident.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of rupture of the stomach are not constant or always\r\nreliable. Always make inquiry as to what and how much the horse has been\r\nfed at the last meal. Vomiting may precede rupture of this organ, as\r\nstated above. This accident appears to be most liable to occur in heavy\r\ndraft horses. A prominent symptom observed (though it may also occur in\r\ndiaphragmatic hernia) is when the horse, if possible, gets the front\r\nfeet on higher ground than the hind ones or sits on his haunches, like a\r\ndog. This position affords relief to some extent, and it will be\r\nmaintained for several minutes; it is also quickly regained when the\r\nhorse has changed it for some other. Colicky symptoms, of course, are\r\npresent, which vary much and present no diagnostic value. As the case\r\nprogresses the horse will often stretch forward the fore legs, lean\r\nbackward and downward until the belly nearly touches the ground, and\r\nthen rise up again with a groan, after which the fluid from his nostrils\r\nis issued in increased quantity. The pulse is fast and weak, breathing\r\nhurried, body bathed in a clammy sweat, limbs tremble violently, the\r\nhorse reels or staggers from side to side, and death quickly ends the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any pathognomonic symptom we must consider the history\r\nof the case; the symptoms of colic that cease suddenly and are succeeded\r\nby cold sweats and tremors; the pulse quick and small and thready,\r\ngrowing weak and more frequent, and at length running down and becoming\r\naltogether imperceptible; looking back at the flank and groaning;\r\nsometimes crouching with the hind quarters; with or without eructation\r\nand vomiting.\r\n\r\nThere is no treatment that can be of any use whatever. Could we be sure\r\nof our diagnosis it would be better to destroy the animal at once.\r\nSince, however, there is always the possibility of a mistake in\r\ndiagnosis, we may give powdered opium in 1-dram doses every two or three\r\nhours, with the object of keeping the stomach as quiet as possible.\r\n\r\nOBSTRUCTION COLIC.--The stomach or bowels may be obstructed by\r\naccumulations of partly digested feed (fecal matter), by foreign bodies,\r\nby displacements, by paralysis, or by abnormal growths.\r\n\r\n_Impaction of the large intestines._--This is a very common bowel\r\ntrouble and one which, if not promptly recognized and properly treated,\r\nresults in death. It is caused by overfeeding, especially of bulky feed\r\ncontaining an excess of indigestible residue; old, dry, hard hay, or\r\nstalks when largely fed; deficiency of secretions of the intestinal\r\ntracts; lack of water; want of exercise, medicines, etc.\r\n\r\nImpaction of the large bowels is to be diagnosed by a slight abdominal\r\npain, which may disappear for a day or two to reappear with more\r\nviolence. The feces are passed somewhat more frequently, but in smaller\r\nquantities and drier; the abdomen is full, but not distended with gas;\r\nthe horse at first is noticed to paw and soon begins to look back at his\r\nsides. Probably one of the most characteristic symptoms is the position\r\nassumed when down. He lies flat on his side, head and legs extended,\r\noccasionally raising his head to look toward his flank; he remains on\r\nhis side for from five to fifteen minutes at a time. Evidently this\r\nposition is the one giving the most freedom from pain. He rises at\r\ntimes, walks about the stall, paws, looks at his sides, backs up against\r\nthe stall, which he presses with his tail, and soon lies down again,\r\nassuming his favored position. The intestinal sounds, as heard by\r\napplying the ear to the flank, are diminished, or there is no sound,\r\nindicating absence of motion of the bowels. The bowels may cease\r\nentirely to move. The pressure of the distended intestine upon the\r\nbladder may cause the horse to make frequent attempts to urinate. The\r\npulse is but little changed at first, being full and sluggish; later, if\r\nthis condition is not overcome, it becomes rapid and feeble. Horses may\r\nsuffer from impaction of the bowels for a week, yet eventually recover,\r\nand cases extending two or even three weeks have ended favorably. As a\r\nrule, however, they seldom last more than four or five days, many, in\r\nfact, dying sooner than this.\r\n\r\nThe treatment consists of efforts to produce movement of the bowels and\r\nto prevent inflammation of the same from arising. A large cathartic is\r\nto be given as early as possible. Either of the following is\r\nrecommended: Powdered Barbados aloes 1 ounce, calomel 2 drams, and\r\npowdered nux vomica 1 dram; or linseed oil 1 pint and croton oil 15\r\ndrops; or from 1 pint to 1 quart of castor oil may be given. Some favor\r\nthe administration of Epsom or Glauber's salt, 1 pound, with one-quarter\r\npound of common salt, claiming that this causes the horse to drink\r\nlargely of water, thus mechanically softening the impacted mass and\r\nfavoring its expulsion. Whichever physic is selected, it is essential\r\nthat a full dose be given. This is much better than small and repeated\r\ndoses. It must be borne in mind that horses require about twenty-four\r\nhours in which to respond to a physic, and under no circumstances is it\r\nto be repeated sooner. If aloes has been given and has failed to operate\r\nat the proper time, oil or some different cathartic should then be\r\nadministered. Allow the horse all the water he will drink. Calomel may\r\nbe administered in half-dram doses, the powder being placed on the\r\ntongue, one dose every two hours until four doses are given.\r\n\r\nEnemas of glycerin, 2 to 4 ounces, are often beneficial. Rubbing or\r\nkneading of the abdominal walls and the application of stimulating\r\nliniments or strong mustard water also, at times, favor the expulsion of\r\nthis mass. Walking exercise must occasionally be given. If this\r\ntreatment is faithfully carried out from the start the majority of cases\r\nwill terminate favorably. When relief is not obtained inflammation of\r\nthe bowels may ensue and cause death.\r\n\r\n_Constipation, or costiveness._--This is often witnessed in the horse,\r\nand particularly in the foal. Many colts die every year from failure on\r\nthe part of the attendant to note the condition of the bowels soon after\r\nbirth. Whenever the foal fails to pass any feces, and in particular if\r\nit presents any signs of colicky pains--straining, etc.--immediate\r\nattention must be given it. As a rule, it will be necessary only to give\r\na few injections of soapy water in the rectum and to introduce the\r\nfinger through the anus to break down any hardened mass of dung found\r\nthere. If this is not effective a purgative must be given. Oils are the\r\nbest for these young animals, and preferably castor oil, giving from 2\r\nto 4 ounces. The foal should always get the first of the mother's milk,\r\nwhich, for a few days, possesses decidedly laxative properties. If a\r\nmare, while suckling, is taking laudanum, morphin, atropia, or similar\r\nmedicines, the foal during this time should be fed by hand and the mare\r\nmilked upon the ground. Constipation in adult horses is often the result\r\nof long feeding on dry, innutritious feed, deficiency of intestinal\r\nsecretions, scanty water supply, or lack of exercise. If the case is not\r\ncomplicated with colicky symptoms a change to light, sloppy diet,\r\nlinseed gruel or tea, with plenty of exercise, is all that is required.\r\nIf colic exists a cathartic is needed. In very many instances the\r\nconstipated condition of the bowels is due to lack of intestinal\r\nsecretions, and when so caused may be treated by giving fluid extract of\r\nbelladonna in 2-dram doses three times a day and handful doses of Epsom\r\nsalt daily in the feed. It is always best, when possible, to overcome\r\nthis trouble by a change of diet rather than by the use of medicines.\r\nFor the relief of constipation such succulent feeds as roots, grass, or\r\ngreen forage are recommended. Silage, however, should be fed sparingly,\r\nand not at all unless it is in the very best condition. Moldy silage may\r\ncause fatal disease.\r\n\r\n_Foreign bodies (calculi, stones) in the stomach._--There are probably\r\nbut few symptoms exhibited by the horse that will lead one to suspect\r\nthe presence of gastric calculi, and possibly none by which we can\r\nunmistakably assert their presence. They have been found most frequently\r\nin millers' horses fed sweepings from the mills. A depraved and\r\ncapricious appetite is common in horses that have a stone forming in the\r\nstomachs. There is a disposition to eat the woodwork of the stable,\r\nearth, and, in fact, almost any substance within their reach. This\r\nsymptom must not, however, be considered as pathognomonic, since it is\r\nobserved when calculi are not present. Occasional colics may result from\r\nthese \"stomach stones,\" and when the latter lodge at the outlet of the\r\nstomach they may give rise to symptoms of engorged stomach, already\r\ndescribed. There is, of course, no treatment that will prove effective.\r\nRemedies to move the bowels, to relieve pain, and to combat inflammation\r\nshould be given.\r\n\r\n_Intestinal concretions (calculi or stones in the intestines)._--These\r\nconcretions are usually found in the large bowels, though they are\r\noccasionally seen in the small intestines. They are of various sizes,\r\nweighing from 1 ounce to 25 pounds; they may be single or multiple, and\r\ndiffer in composition and appearance, some being soft (composed mostly\r\nof animal or vegetable matter), while others are porous, or honeycombed\r\n(consisting of animal and mineral matter), and others are entirely hard\r\nand stonelike. The hair balls, so common to the stomach and intestines\r\nof cattle, are very rare in horses. Intestinal calculi form around some\r\nforeign body, as a rule--a nail or piece of wood--whose shape they may\r\nassume to a certain extent. Layers are arranged concentrically around\r\nsuch nucleus until the sizes above spoken of are attained. These stones\r\nare also often found in millers' horses, as well also as in horses in\r\nlimestone districts, where the water is hard. When the calculi attain a\r\nsufficient size and become lodged or blocked in some part of the\r\nintestines, they cause obstruction, inflammation of the bowels, colicky\r\nsymptoms, and death. There are no certain signs or symptoms that reveal\r\nthem. Recurring colics of the type of impaction colic, but more severe,\r\nmay lead one to suspect the existence of this condition. Examination\r\nthrough the rectum may reveal the calculus.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms will be those of obstruction of the bowels. Upon\r\npost-mortem examinations these stones will be discovered mostly in the\r\nlarge bowels; the intestines will be inflamed or gangrenous about the\r\npoint of obstruction. Sometimes calculi have been expelled by the action\r\nof a physic, or they may be removed by the hand when found to occupy the\r\nrectum.\r\n\r\nAs in concretions of the stomach, but little can be done in the way of\r\ntreatment more than to overcome spasm (if any exists), and to give\r\nphysics with the hope of dislodging the stone or stones and carrying\r\nthem on and outward.\r\n\r\n_Intussusception, or invagination._--This is the slipping of a portion\r\nof the intestine into another portion immediately adjoining, like a\r\npartially turned glove finger. This may occur at any part of the bowels,\r\nbut is most frequent in the small guts. The invaginated portion may be\r\nslight--2 or 3 inches only--or extensive, measuring as many feet. In\r\nintussusception, the inturned bowel is in the direction of the anus.\r\nThere are adhesions of the intestines at this point, congestion,\r\ninflammation, or even gangrene. This accident is most liable to occur in\r\nhorses that are suffering from spasm of the bowel, or in those in which\r\na small portion of the gut is paralyzed. The natural wormlike or\r\nringlike contraction of the gut favors the passage of the contracted or\r\nparalyzed portion into that immediately behind it. It may occur during\r\nthe existence of almost any abdominal trouble, as diarrhea, inflammation\r\nof the bowels, or from injuries, exposure to cold, etc. A fall or\r\nleaping may give the initial maldirection. Foals are most likely to be\r\nthus afflicted.\r\n\r\nUnless the invaginated portion of the gut becomes strangulated, probably\r\nno symptoms except constipation will be appreciable. Strangulation of\r\nthe bowel may take place suddenly, and the horse die within 24 hours, or\r\nit may occur after several days--a week even--and death then follow.\r\nThere are no symptoms positively diagnostic. Colicky pains, more or less\r\nsevere and continuous, are observed, and at first there may be diarrhea,\r\nfollowed by constipation. Severe straining occurs in some instances of\r\nintussusception, and when this occurs it should receive due credit. As\r\ndeath approaches, the horse sweats profusely, sighs, presents an anxious\r\ncountenance, the legs and ears become cold, and there is often freedom\r\nfrom pain immediately before death. In some rare instances he recovers,\r\neven though the invaginated portion of the gut has become strangulated.\r\nIn this case the imprisoned portion sloughs away so gradually that a\r\nunion has taken place between the intestines at the point where one\r\nportion has slipped into that behind it. The piece sloughing off is\r\nfound passed with the manure. Such cases are exceedingly rare.\r\nNonirritating laxatives, such as castor oil, sweet oil, or calomel in\r\nsmall doses, should be given. Soft feed and mucilaginous and nourishing\r\ndrinks should be given during these attacks. E. Mayhew Michener has\r\noperated successfully on a foal with intussusception by opening the\r\nabdomen and releasing the imprisoned gut.\r\n\r\n_Volvulus, gut tie, or twisting of the bowels._--These are the terms\r\napplied to the bowels when twisted or knotted. This accident is rather a\r\ncommon one, and frequently results from the violent manner in which a\r\nhorse throws himself about when attacked by spasmodic colic. The\r\nsymptoms are the same as those of intussusception and obstructions of\r\nthe bowels; the same directions as to treatment are therefore to be\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n_Paralysis of the intestine._--This occurs in old, debilitated animals\r\nthat have been fed on coarse, innutritious fodder. This produces a\r\ncondition of dilatation so pronounced as to make it impossible for the\r\nintestine to advance its contents, and so obstruction results. The\r\nsymptoms are as in other forms of obstruction colic. The history of the\r\ncase is of much service in diagnosing the trouble. The treatment\r\nconsists in the administration of laxatives. One may give 1 quart of raw\r\nlinseed oil and follow it the next day with 1 pound of Glauber's salt\r\ndissolved in a quart of warm water. Strychnia may be given in doses of 1\r\ngrain two or three times daily. If the stagnant mass of feces is in the\r\nrectum, it must be removed with the hand.\r\n\r\n_Abnormal growths_, such as tumors or fibrous tissue, producing\r\ncontraction or stricture, may be causes of obstruction. The colic caused\r\nby these conditions is chronic. The attacks occur at gradually\r\nshortening intervals and become progressively more severe. Relief is\r\nafforded by the use of purgatives that render the feces soft and thin\r\nand thus enable them to pass the obstruction, but in time the contracted\r\nplace is liable to close so far that passage is impossible and the horse\r\nwill die.\r\n\r\nFLATULENT COLIC (TYMPANITIC COLIC, WIND COLIC, OR BLOAT).--Among the\r\nmost frequent causes of this form of colic are to be mentioned sudden\r\nchanges of feed, too long fasting and feed then given while the animal\r\nis exhausted, new hay or grain, large quantities of feed that is green\r\nor that has lain in the manger for some time and become sour,\r\nindigestible feed, irregular teeth, crib biting, and, in fact, anything\r\nthat produces indigestion may produce flatulent colic.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms of wind colic are not so suddenly developed\r\nnor so severe as those of cramp colic. At first the horse is noticed to\r\nbe dull, paws slightly, and may or may not lie down. The pains from the\r\nstart are continuous. The belly enlarges, and by striking it in front of\r\nthe haunches a drumlike sound results. If not soon relieved the above\r\nsymptoms are aggravated, and in addition difficult breathing, bloodshot\r\neyes, and red mucous membranes, loud tumultuous heart beat, profuse\r\nperspiration, trembling of front legs, sighing respiration, staggering\r\nfrom side to side are noticed, and, finally, plunging forward dead. The\r\ndiagnostic symptom of flatulent colic is the distention of the bowels\r\nwith gas, detected by the bloated appearance and resonance on\r\npercussion.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment for wind colic differs very greatly from\r\nthat of cramp colic. Absorbents are of some service, and charcoal may be\r\ngiven in any quantity. Relaxants and antispasmodics are also beneficial\r\nin this form of colic. Chloral hydrate not only possesses these\r\nqualities, but it also is an antiferment and a pain reliever. It is,\r\nthen, particularly well adapted to the treatment of wind colic, and\r\nshould be given in the same-sized doses and in the manner directed for\r\nspasmodic colic. Diluted alcohol or whisky may be given, or aromatic\r\nspirits of ammonia in 1-ounce doses at short intervals.\r\n\r\nA physic should always be given as early as possible in flatulent colic,\r\nthe best being Barbados aloes in the dose already mentioned. Injections,\r\nper rectum, of turpentine 1 to 2 ounces, linseed oil 8 ounces, may be\r\ngiven frequently to stimulate the peristaltic motion of the bowels and\r\nto favor the escape of wind. Blankets wrung out of hot water do much to\r\nafford relief; they should be renewed every 5 or 10 minutes and covered\r\nwith a dry woolen blanket. This form of colic is much more fatal than\r\ncramp colic, and requires prompt and persistent treatment. It is\r\nentirely unsafe to predict the result, some apparently mild attacks\r\ngoing on to speedy death, while others that at the onset appear to be\r\nvery severe yielding rapidly to treatment. No efforts should be spared\r\nuntil the animal is known to be dead. In these severe cases puncturing\r\nof the bowels in the most prominent (distended) part by means of a small\r\ntrocar and cannula or with a needle of a hypodermic syringe, thus\r\nallowing the escape of gas, has often saved life, and such punctures, if\r\nmade with a clean, sharp instrument that is not allowed to remain in the\r\nhorse too long, are accompanied with little danger and do more to\r\nrelieve the patient quickly than any other treatment.\r\n\r\nSPASMODIC OR CRAMP COLIC.--This is the name given to that form of colic\r\nproduced by contraction, or spasm, of a portion of the small intestines.\r\nIt is produced by indigestible feed; large drinks of cold water when the\r\nanimal is warm; driving a heated horse through deep streams; cold rains;\r\ndrafts of cold air, etc. Unequal distribution of or interference with\r\nthe nervous supply here produces cramp of the bowels, the same as\r\nexternal cramps are produced. Spasmodic colic is much more frequently\r\nmet with in high-bred, nervous horses than in coarse, lymphatic ones.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--These should be carefully studied in order to diagnose this\r\nfrom other forms of colic requiring quite different treatment. Spasmodic\r\ncolic always begins suddenly. If feeding, the horse is seen to stop\r\nabruptly, stamp impatiently, and probably look back. He soon evinces\r\nmore acute pain, shown by pawing, suddenly lying down, rolling, and\r\ngetting up. During the period of pain the intestinal sounds, as heard by\r\napplying the ear over the flank, are louder than in health. There is\r\nthen an interval of ease; he will resume feeding and appear to be\r\nentirely well. In a little while, however, the pains return and are\r\nincreased in severity, only to pass off again for a time. As the attack\r\nprogresses these intervals of ease become shorter and shorter, and pain\r\nmay be continuous, though even then there are exacerbations of pain.\r\nAnimals suffering from this form of colic evince the most intense pain;\r\nthey throw themselves, roll over and over, jump up, whirl about, drop\r\ndown again, paw, or strike rather, with the front feet, steam and sweat,\r\nand make frequent attempts to pass their urine. Only a small quantity of\r\nwater is passed at a time; this is due to the bladder being so\r\nfrequently emptied. These attempts to urinate are often regarded by\r\nhorsemen as symptoms of trouble of the kidneys or bladder. In reality\r\nthey are only one of the many ways in which the horse expresses the\r\npresence of pain. As a matter of fact, diseases of the bladder or\r\nkidneys of the horse are exceedingly rare.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate the symptoms of spasmodic colic: The history of the\r\ncase, the type of horse, the suddenness of the attack, the increased\r\nintestinal sounds, the intervals of ease (which become of shorter\r\nduration as the case progresses), the violent pain, the normal\r\ntemperature and pulse during the intervals of ease, the frequent\r\nattempts to urinate, etc., should be kept in mind, and there is then but\r\nlittle danger of confounding this with other forms of colic.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Since the pain is due to spasm or cramp of the bowels,\r\nmedicines that overcome spasms--antispasmodics--are the ones indicated.\r\nChloral hydrate may be used. This is to be given in a dose of 1 ounce in\r\na pint of water as a drench. As this drug is irritant to the throat and\r\nstomach, it has to be well diluted. A common and good remedy is\r\nsulphuric ether and laudanum, of each 2 ounces, in a half pint of\r\nlinseed oil. Another drench may be composed of 2 ounces each of\r\nsulphuric ether and alcohol in 8 ounces of water. If nothing else is at\r\nhand give whisky, one-half pint in hot water. Jamaica ginger is useful.\r\nIf relief is not obtained in one hour from any of the above doses, they\r\nmay then be repeated. The body should be warmly clothed and perspiration\r\ninduced. Blankets dipped in very hot water to which a small quantity of\r\nturpentine has been added should be placed around the belly and covered\r\nwith dry blankets or the abdomen may be rubbed with stimulating\r\nliniments or mustard water. The difficulty, however, of applying hot\r\nblankets and keeping them in place forces us in most instances to\r\ndispense with them. If the cramp is due to irritants in the bowels, a\r\ncure is not complete until a cathartic of 1 ounce of aloes or 1 pint of\r\nlinseed oil is given. Injections of warm, soapy water or salt and water\r\ninto the rectum aid the cure.\r\n\r\nRectal injections, clysters, or enemas as a rule should be lukewarm, and\r\nfrom 3 to 6 quarts are to be given at a time. They may be repeated every\r\nhalf hour if necessary. Great care is to be taken not to injure the\r\nrectum in giving such injections. A large syringe or a piece of rubber\r\nhose 4 or 5 feet long, with a funnel attached at one end, affords the\r\nbest means by which to give them. The pipe of the syringe or the hose\r\nintroduced into the rectum must be blunt, rounded, and smooth; it is to\r\nbe thoroughly oiled and then carefully pushed through the anus in a\r\nslightly upward direction. Much force must be avoided, for the rectum\r\nmay be lacerated and serious complications or even death result.\r\nExercise will aid the action of the bowels in this and similar colicky\r\ntroubles, but severe galloping or trotting is to be avoided. If the\r\nhorse can have a loose box or paddock, it is the best, as he will then\r\ntake what exercise he wants. If the patient is extremely violent, it is\r\noften wise to restrain him by leading him with a halter, since rupture\r\nof the stomach or displacement of the bowels may result and complicate\r\nthe trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIGESTION OR GASTROINTESTINAL CATARRH.\r\n\r\nFrom the facts that they merge insensibly into each other and usually\r\noccur simultaneously, there is ample reason for considering these\r\nconditions together. This condition may be acute--that is, of sudden\r\nonset--or it may be chronic. The changes of structure produced by this\r\ndisease occur in the mucous membrane lining of the stomach and\r\nintestines. This membrane becomes red from increased blood supply or\r\nfrom hemorrhage into it, is swollen, and is covered by a coating of\r\nslimy mucus. In some especially severe cases the membrane is destroyed\r\nin spots, causing the appearance of ulcers or of erosions.\r\n\r\nThe causes of indigestion are numerous, but nearly all are the result of\r\nerrors in feeding.\r\n\r\nSome horses are naturally endowed with weak digestive organs, and such\r\nare predisposed to this condition. Anything that irritates the stomach\r\nor intestines may cause this disease. Feeds that the animal is\r\nunaccustomed to, sudden changes of diet, imperfectly cured, unripe, or\r\ndamaged feeds are all fruitful causes, and so are worms. In suckling\r\nfoals this condition may come from some disease of the dam that renders\r\nher milk indigestible, or from overexertion or overheating of the mare.\r\nAnother prolific cause is bad teeth, making mastication imperfect, and\r\nthus causing the horse to swallow his feed in a condition unfit for the\r\naction of the digestive juices. Working a horse too soon or too hard\r\nafter feeding may cause either colic or indigestion. Any condition that\r\nreduces the vitality, such as disease, overwork, poor feed, or lack of\r\ncare, may directly bring on indigestion by weakening the digestive\r\norgans.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Indigestion is characterized by irregular appetite;\r\nrefusing all feed at times, and at others eating ravenously; the\r\nappetite is not only irregular, but is often depraved; there is a\r\ndisposition on the part of the horse to eat unusual substances, such as\r\nwood, soiled bedding, or even his own feces; the bowels are irregular\r\nto-day, loose and bad smelling, to-morrow bound; whole grain is often\r\npassed in the feces, and the hay passed in balls or impacted masses,\r\nundergoing but little change; the horse frequently passes considerable\r\nquantities of sour-smelling wind. The animal loses flesh, the skin\r\npresents a hard, dry appearance and seems very tight (hidebound). If the\r\nstomach is very seriously involved, the horse may yawn by stretching\r\nthe head forward and upward and by turning the upper lip outward. There\r\nmay be more or less colicky pain. In the chronic cases there is mental\r\ndepression; the horse is sluggish and dull. The abdomen gradually\r\nbecomes small, giving a \"tucked up\" appearance, or, on the other hand,\r\nit becomes flaccid and pendulous.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--One should commence with the feed--its quality, quantity,\r\nand time of feeding; examine the water supply, and see, besides, that it\r\nis given before feeding; then carefully observe the condition of the\r\nmouth and teeth; and, continuing the observations as best we may,\r\nendeavor to find the seat of the trouble. If the teeth are sharp or\r\nirregular they must be rasped down; if any are decayed they must be\r\nextracted; if indigestion is due to ravenous eating or bolting, the feed\r\nmust then be given from a large manger where the grain can be spread and\r\nthe horse thus compelled to eat slowly.\r\n\r\nAny irritation, such as worms, undigested feed, etc., that is operating\r\nas a cause is to be removed by appropriate treatment, as advised\r\nelsewhere. If there is a tendency to distention of the stomach and\r\nbowels, with gas, during indigestion, the following may be used: Baking\r\nsoda, powdered ginger, and powdered gentian, equal parts. These are to\r\nbe thoroughly mixed and given in heaping tablespoonful doses, twice a\r\nday, before feeding. This powder is best given by dissolving the\r\nabove-named quantity in a half pint of water and given as a drench.\r\n\r\nAs a digestive tonic the following is good: Glauber's salt, 2 pounds;\r\ncommon salt, 1 pound; baking soda, one-half pound. Of this a heaping\r\ntablespoonful may be given in each feed. If diarrhea exists, the\r\ntreatment advised below may be used.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIARRHEA.\r\n\r\nDiarrhea is due to indigestion or intestinal catarrh or to irritation of\r\nthe bowels from eating moldy or musty feed, drinking stagnant water,\r\ndiseased condition of the teeth, eating irritating substances, to being\r\nkept on low, marshy pastures, and to exposure during cold nights, or in\r\nlow, damp stables. Some horses are predisposed to scour and are called\r\n\"washy\" by horsemen; they are those with long bodies, long legs, and\r\nnarrow, flat sides. Horses of this build are almost sure to scour if fed\r\nor watered immediately before being put to work. Fast or road work, of\r\ncourse, aggravates this trouble. Diarrhea may exist as a complication of\r\nother diseases, as pneumonia and influenza, for instance, and again\r\nduring the diseases of the liver.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms are the frequent evacuations of liquid stools, with or\r\nwithout pronounced abdominal pain, loss of appetite, emaciation, etc.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ is at times very simple, but requires the utmost care and\r\njudgment. If due to faulty feed or water it is sufficient to change\r\nthese. If it results from some irritant in the intestines this is best\r\ngotten rid of by the administration of an oleaginous purge, for which\r\nnothing is better than castor oil, although raw linseed oil may be used\r\nif the case is not severe. The diarrhea often disappears with the\r\ncessation of the operation of the medicine. If, however, purging\r\ncontinues it may be checked by giving wheat flour in water, starch\r\nwater, white-oak bark tea, chalk, opium, or half-dram doses of sulphuric\r\nacid in one-half pint of water twice or thrice daily. Good results\r\nfollow the use of powdered opium 2 drams and subnitrate of bismuth 1\r\nounce, repeated three times a day. In all cases it should be remembered\r\nto look to the water and feed the horse is receiving. If either of these\r\nis at fault it is at once to be discontinued. We should feed sparingly\r\nof good, easily digested feeds. With that peculiar build of nervous\r\nhorses that scour on the road but little can be done as a rule. They\r\nshould be watered and fed as long as possible before going on a drive.\r\nIf there is much flatulency accompanying diarrhea baking soda or other\r\nalkaline medicines may effect a cure, while if the discharges have a\r\nvery disagreeable odor it may be corrected by 1 ounce of sulphite of\r\nsoda or dram doses of creolin in water, repeated twice a day. Be slow to\r\nresort to either the vegetable or mineral astringents, since the\r\nmajority of cases will yield to change of feed and water or the\r\nadministration of oils. Afterwards feed upon wheat-flour gruel or other\r\nlight feeds. The body should be warmly clothed.\r\n\r\nSUPERPURGATION.--This is the designation of that diarrhea, or flux from\r\nthe bowels, that, at times, is induced by and follows the action of a\r\nphysic. It is accompanied with much irritation or even inflammation of\r\nthe bowels and is always of a serious character. Although in rare\r\ninstances it follows from a usual dose of physic and where every\r\nprecaution has been taken, it is most likely to result under the\r\nfollowing circumstances: Too large a dose of physic; giving physics to\r\nhorses suffering from pneumonia, influenza, or other debilitating\r\ndiseases; riding or driving a horse when purging; exposure or drafts of\r\ncold air; or giving large quantities of cold water while the physic is\r\noperating. There is always danger of superpurgation if a physic is given\r\nto a horse suffering from diseases of the respiratory organs. Small and\r\noften-repeated physics are also to be avoided, as they produce debility\r\nand great depression of the system and predispose to this disorder. When\r\na physic is to be given one should rest the horse and give him sloppy\r\nfeed until the medicine begins to operate; clothe the body with a warm\r\nblanket; keep out of drafts; give only warm water in small quantities.\r\nAfter a horse has purged from twelve to twenty-four hours it can mostly\r\nbe stopped, or \"set,\" as horsemen say, by feeding on dry oats and hay.\r\nShould the purging continue, however, it is best treated by giving\r\ndemulcent drinks--linseed tea and oatmeal or wheat-flour gruel. After\r\nthis the astringents spoken of for diarrhea may be given. Besides this\r\nthe horse is to receive brandy in doses of from 2 to 4 ounces, with milk\r\nand eggs, four or five times a day.\r\n\r\nLaminitis (\"founder\") is a frequent sequel of superpurgation and is to\r\nbe guarded against by removing the shoes and standing the horse on moist\r\nsawdust or some similar bedding.\r\n\r\n\r\nDYSENTERY.\r\n\r\nThis disease, sometimes called \"bloody flux,\" is an intestinal disease\r\nattended with fever, occasional abdominal pains, and fluid discharges\r\nmingled with blood. Discharges in dysentery are coffee colored or\r\nbloody, liquid, and very offensive in odor, and passed with much\r\nstraining. It is rare in the horse, but is sometimes quite prevalent\r\namong foals.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Probably the most common cause is keeping young horses in\r\nparticular for a long time on low, wet, marshy pastures, without other\r\nfeed (a diarrhea of long standing sometimes terminates in dysentery);\r\nexposure during cold, wet weather; decomposed feeds; stagnant water that\r\ncontains large quantities of decomposing vegetable matter; low, damp,\r\nand dark stables, particularly if crowded; the existence of some\r\ndisease, as tuberculosis of the abdominal form. In suckling foals it may\r\ncome from feeding the dam on irritant feeds or from disease of the\r\nudder. In other foals it may be produced by exposure to cold and damp,\r\nto irritant feed, or to worms.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The initial symptom is a chill, which probably escapes\r\nnotice in the majority of instances. The discharges are offensive and\r\nfor the most part liquid, although it is common to find lumps of solid\r\nfecal matter floating in this liquid portion; shreds of mucous membrane\r\nand blood may be passed or the evacuations may be mucopurulent; there is\r\nmuch straining, and, rarely, symptoms of abdominal pain; the subject\r\nlies down a great deal; the pulse is quickened and the temperature\r\nelevated. Thirst is a prominent symptom. In the adult, death rarely\r\nfollows under two to three weeks, but in foals the disease may end in\r\ndeath after a few days.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--This is most unsatisfactory, and I am inclined to place\r\nmore dependence upon the care and feed than any medication that may be\r\nadopted. First of all the horse must be placed in a dry, warm, yet\r\nwell-ventilated stable; the skin is to receive attention by frequent\r\nrubbings of the surface of the body, with blankets, and bandages to the\r\nlegs. The water must be pure and given in small quantities; the feed,\r\nthat which is light and easily digested. Medicinally, give at first a\r\nlight dose of castor oil, about one-half pint, to which has been added 2\r\nounces of laudanum. The vegetable or mineral astringents are also to be\r\ngiven. Starch injections containing laudanum often afford great relief.\r\nThe strength must be kept up by milk punches, eggs, beef tea, oatmeal\r\ngruel, etc. In spite of the best care and treatment, however, dysentery\r\nis likely to prove fatal. In the case of nurslings, the dam should be\r\nplaced in a healthy condition or, failing in this, milk should be had\r\nfrom another mare or from a cow.\r\n\r\n\r\nGASTROENTERITIS.\r\n\r\nThis condition consists in an inflammation of the stomach and\r\nintestines. Instead of being confined to the mucous, or lining,\r\nmembrane, as in gastrointestinal catarrh, the inflammatory process\r\nextends deeper and may even involve the entire thickness of the wall of\r\nthe organ.\r\n\r\nThis disease may be caused by irritant feed, hot drinks, sudden\r\nchilling, moldy or decayed feeds, foul water, parasites, or by chemical\r\npoisons. It may also complicate some general diseases, especially\r\ninfectious diseases, as anthrax, influenza, rabies, or petechial fever.\r\nLong-continued obstruction of the bowels or displacement resulting in\r\ndeath are preceded by enteritis.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms differ somewhat with the cause and depend\r\nalso, to some extent, upon the chief location of the inflammation. In\r\ngeneral the animal stops eating or eats but little; it shows colicky\r\npain; fever develops; the pulse and respiration become rapid; the mucous\r\nmembrane becomes red; the mouth is hot and dry. Pressure upon the\r\nabdomen may cause pain. Intestinal sounds can not be heard at the flank.\r\nThere is constipation in the earlier stages that is, followed later by\r\ndiarrhea. The extremities become cold. Sometimes the feces are coated\r\nwith or contain shreds of fibrin, looking like scraps of dead membrane,\r\nand they have an evil, putrid odor. If the disease is caused by moldy or\r\ndamaged feed there may be great muscular weakness, with partial\r\nparalysis of the throat, as shown by inability to swallow. If chemical\r\npoisons are the cause, this fact may be shown by the sudden onset of the\r\ndisease, the history of the administration of a poison or the entire\r\nabsence of known cause, the rapid development of threatening symptoms,\r\nthe involvement of a series of animals in the absence of a contagious\r\ndisease, and the special symptoms and alterations known to be produced\r\nby certain poisons. To make this chain of evidence complete, the poison\r\nmay be discovered in the organs of the horse by chemical analysis. In\r\nnearly all cases of gastro-enteritis there is nervous depression.\r\n\r\nThe poisons that are most irritant to the digestive tract are arsenic,\r\ncorrosive sublimate, sugar of lead, sulphate of copper, sulphate or\r\nchlorid of zinc, lye, or other strong alkalies, mineral acids, and,\r\namong the vegetable poisons, tobacco, lobelia, and water hemlock.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment will depend upon the cause, but if this can\r\nnot be detected, certain general indications may be observed. In all\r\ncases feed should be given in small amounts and should be of the most\r\nsoothing description, as oatmeal gruel, flaxseed tea, hay tea, fresh\r\ngrass, or rice water. The skin should be well rubbed with alcohol and\r\nwisps of straw, to equalize the distribution of the blood; the legs,\r\nafter being rubbed until warm, should be bandaged in raw cotton or with\r\nwoolen bandages. The horse should be warmly blanketed. It is well to\r\napply to the abdomen blankets wrung out of hot water and frequently\r\nchanged; or mustard paste may be rubbed on the skin of the belly.\r\nInternally, opium is of service to allay pain, check secretion, and\r\nsoothe the inflamed membrane. The dose is from 1 to 2 drams, given every\r\nthree of four hours. If there is constipation, the opium should be mixed\r\nwith 30 grains of calomel. Subnitrate of bismuth may be given with the\r\nopium or separately in 2-dram doses. Stimulants, such as alcohol,\r\naromatic spirits of ammonia, or camphor may be given in 2-ounce doses,\r\nmixed with warm water to make a drench.\r\n\r\nIf putrid feed has been consumed, creolin may be administered in doses\r\nof 2 drams, mixed with 1 pint of warm water or milk. If there is\r\nobstinate constipation and if a laxative must be employed, it should be\r\nsweet or castor oil, from 1 pint to 1 quart.\r\n\r\n_Antidotes for poisons._--For the various poisons the remedies are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nArsenic: Oxyhydrate of iron solution, 1 pint to 1 quart; or calcined\r\nmagnesia, one-half ounce in 1 pint of water.\r\n\r\nCorrosive sublimate (bichlorid of mercury): The whites of a dozen eggs,\r\nor 2 ounces of flowers of sulphur.\r\n\r\nSugar of lead: Glauber's salt, 1 pound in 1 quart of warm water; to be\r\nfollowed with iodid of potash, 3 drams at a dose, in water, three times\r\ndaily for five days.\r\n\r\nSulphate of copper: Milk, the whites of eggs, or reduced iron.\r\n\r\nSulphate or chlorid of zinc: Milk, the whites of eggs, or calcined\r\nmagnesia.\r\n\r\nLye or alkalies, as caustic potash or soda: Vinegar, dilute sulphuric\r\nacid, and linseed tea, with opium, 3 drams.\r\n\r\nMineral acids: Chalk, or calcined magnesia, or baking soda; later give\r\nlinseed tea and opium.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEMORRHOIDS, OR PILES.\r\n\r\nThese are rare, comparatively, in horses. They are diagnosed by the\r\nappearance of bright-red irregular tumors after defecation, which may\r\nremain visible at all times or be seen only when the horse is down or\r\nafter passing his manure. They are mostly due to constipation,\r\nirritation, or injuries, or follow from the severe straining during\r\ndysentery. I have observed them to follow from severe labor pains in the\r\nmare.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Attention must be paid to the condition of the bowels;\r\nthey should be soft, but purging is to be avoided. The tumors should be\r\nwashed in warm water and thoroughly cleansed, after which scarify them\r\nand gently but firmly squeeze out the liquid that will be seen to follow\r\nthe shallow incisions. After thus squeezing these tumors and before\r\nreplacing through the anus, bathe the parts with some anodyn wash. For\r\nthis purpose the glycerite of tannin and laudanum in equal parts is\r\ngood. Mucilaginous injections into the rectum may be of service for a\r\nfew days.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERNIA, OR RUPTURE.\r\n\r\nThere are several kinds or hernias that require notice, not all of\r\nwhich, however, produce serious symptoms or results. Abdominal hernias,\r\nor ruptures, are divided into reducible, irreducible, and strangulated,\r\naccording to condition; and into inguinal, scrotal, ventral, umbilical,\r\nand diaphragmatic, according to their situation. A hernia is reducible\r\nwhen the displaced organ can be returned to its natural location. It\r\nconsists of a soft swelling, without heat, pain, or any uneasiness,\r\ngenerally larger on full feed, and decreases in size as the bowels\r\nbecome empty. An irreducible hernia is one that can not be returned into\r\nthe abdomen, and yet does not cause any pain or uneasiness. Strangulated\r\nhernia is one in which the contents of the sac are greatly distended, or\r\nwhen from pressure upon the blood vessels of the imprisoned portion the\r\nvenous circulation is checked or stopped, thereby causing congestion,\r\nswelling, inflammation, and, if not relieved, gangrene of the part and\r\ndeath of the animal. According to the time or mode of origin, hernias\r\nmay be congenital or acquired.\r\n\r\nCONGENITAL SCROTAL HERNIA.--Not a few foals are noticed from birth to\r\nhave an enlarged scrotum, which gradually increases in size until about\r\nthe sixth month, sometimes longer. Sometimes the scrotum of a\r\nsix-months-old colt is as large as that of an adult stallion, and\r\noperative treatment is considered. This is unnecessary in the great\r\nmajority of cases, as the enlargement often disappears by the time the\r\ncolt has reached his second year. Any interference, medicinal or\r\nsurgical, is worse than useless. If the intestine contained within the\r\nscrotum should at any time become strangulated, it must then be treated\r\nthe same as in an adult horse.\r\n\r\nSCROTAL HERNIA is caused by dilatation of the sheath of the testicle,\r\ncombined with relaxation of the fibrous tissues surrounding the inguinal\r\nring, thus allowing the intestine to descend to the scrotum. At first\r\nthis is intermittent, appearing during work and returning when the horse\r\nis at rest. For a long time this form of hernia may not cause the least\r\nuneasiness or distress. In course of time, however, the imprisoned gut\r\nbecomes filled with feces, its return into the abdominal cavity is\r\nprevented, and it becomes strangulated. While the gut is thus filling\r\nthe horse often appears dull, is disinclined to move, appetite is\r\nimpaired, and there is rumbling and obstruction of the bowels. Colicky\r\nsymptoms now supervene. Strangulation and its consequent train of\r\nsymptoms do not always follow in scrotal hernia, for often horses have\r\nthis condition for years without suffering inconvenience.\r\n\r\nINGUINAL HERNIA is but an incomplete scrotal hernia, and, like the\r\nlatter, may exist and cause no signs of distress, or, again, it may\r\nbecome strangulated and cause death. Inguinal hernia is seen mostly in\r\nstallions, next in geldings, and very rarely in the mare. Bearing in\r\nmind that scrotal hernia is seen only in entire horses, we may proceed\r\nto detail the symptoms of strangulated, inguinal, and scrotal hernia at\r\nthe same time. When, during the existence of colicky symptoms, we find a\r\nhorse kicking with his hind feet while standing or lying upon his back,\r\nwe should look to the inguinal region and scrotum. If scrotal hernia\r\nexists, the scrotum will be enlarged and lobulated; by pressure we may\r\nforce a portion of the contents of the gut back into the abdomen,\r\neliciting a gurgling sound. If we take a gentle but firm hold upon the\r\nenlarged scrotum and then have an assistant cause the horse to cough,\r\nthe swelling will be felt to expand and as quickly contract again.\r\n\r\nThe history of these cases will materially aid us, as the owner can\r\noften assure us of preceding attacks of \"colic,\" more or less severe,\r\nthat have been instantaneously relieved in some (to him) unaccountable\r\nmanner. The colicky symptoms of these hernias are not diagnostic, but,\r\nprobably, more closely resemble those of enteritis than any other bowel\r\ndiseases. In many cases the diagnosis can be made only by a\r\nveterinarian, when he has recourse to a rectal examination; the bowels\r\ncan here be felt entering the internal abdominal ring.\r\n\r\n_Treatment of inguinal hernia._--If the reader is sure of the existence\r\nof hernia, he should secure the horse upon its back, and, with a hand in\r\nthe rectum, endeavor to catch hold of the wandering bowel and pull it\r\ngently back into the cavity of the abdomen. Pressure should be made upon\r\nthe scrotum during this time. If this fails, a veterinarian must be\r\ncalled to reduce the hernia by means of incising the inguinal ring,\r\nreplacing the intestines, and to castrate, using clamps and performing\r\nthe \"covered operation.\"\r\n\r\nVENTRAL HERNIA.--In this form of hernia the protrusion is through some\r\naccidental opening or rupture of the abdominal wall. It may occur at any\r\npart of the belly except at the umbilicus, and is caused by kicks,\r\nblows, hooks, severe jumping or pulling, etc. Ventral hernia is most\r\ncommon in pregnant mares, and is here due to the weight of the fetus or\r\nto some degenerative changes taking place in the abdominal coats. It is\r\nrecognized by the appearance of a swelling, at the base of which can be\r\nfelt the opening or rent in the abdominal tunics, and from the fact that\r\nthe swelling containing the intestines can be made to disappear when the\r\nanimal is placed in a favorable position.\r\n\r\n_Treatment of ventral hernia._--In many instances there is no occasion\r\nfor treatment, and again, where the hernial sac is extensive, treatment\r\nis of no avail. If the hernia is small, a cure may be attempted by the\r\nmethods to be described in treating of umbilical hernia. If one is\r\nfortunate enough to be present when the hernia occurs, and particularly\r\nif it is not too large, he may, by the proper application of a pad and\r\nbroad bandage, effect a perfect cure.\r\n\r\nUMBILICAL HERNIA is the passing of any portion of the bowel or omentum\r\n(\"caul\") through the navel, forming a \"tumor\" at this point. This is\r\noften congenital in our animals, and is due to the imperfect closure of\r\nthe umbilicus and to the position of the body. Many cases of umbilical\r\nhernia, like inguinal and scrotal of the congenital kind, disappear\r\nentirely by the time the animal reaches its second or third year.\r\nAdvancing age favors cure in these cases from the fact that the omentum\r\n(swinging support of the bowels) is proportionally shorter in adults\r\nthan in foals, thus lifting the intestines out of the hernial sac and\r\nallowing the opening in the walls to close. Probably one of the most\r\nfrequent causes of umbilical hernia in foals is the practice of keeping\r\nthem too long from their dams, causing them to fret and worry, and to\r\nneigh, or cry, by the hour. The contraction of the abdominal muscles and\r\npressure of the intestines during neighing seem to open the umbilicus\r\nand induce hernia. Accidents may cause umbilical hernia in adults in the\r\nsame manner as ventral hernia is produced, though this is very rare.\r\n\r\n_Treatment of umbilical hernia._--In the treatment of umbilical hernia\r\nit should be remembered that congenital hernias are often removed with\r\nage, but probably congenital _umbilical hernias_ less frequently than\r\nothers. Among the many plans of treatment are to be mentioned the\r\napplication of a pad over the tumor, the pad being held in place by a\r\nbroad, tight bandage placed around the animal's body. The chief\r\nobjection to this is the difficulty in keeping the pad in its place.\r\nBlisters are often applied over the swelling, and, as the skin hardens\r\nand contracts by the formation of scabs, an artificial bandage or\r\npressure is produced that at times is successful. Another treatment that\r\nhas gained considerable repute of late years consists in first clipping\r\noff the hair over the swelling. Nitric acid is then applied with a small\r\nbrush, using only enough to moisten the skin. This sets up a\r\ndeep-seated, adhesive inflammation, which, in very many cases, closes\r\nthe opening in the navel. Still another plan is to inject a solution of\r\ncommon salt by means of the hypodermic syringe at three or four points\r\nabout the base of the swelling. This acts in the same manner as the\r\npreceding, but may cause serious injury if the syringe or solution is\r\nnot sterile.\r\n\r\nOthers, again, after keeping the animal fasting for a few hours, cast\r\nand secure it upon its back; the bowel is then carefully returned into\r\nthe abdomen. The skin over the opening is pinched up and one or two\r\nskewers are run through the skin from side to side as close as possible\r\nto the umbilical opening. These skewers are kept in place by passing a\r\ncord around the skin between them and the abdomen and securely tying it.\r\nGreat care must be taken not to draw these cords too tight, as this\r\nwould cause a speedy slough of the skin, the intestines would extrude,\r\nand death result. If properly applied, an adhesion is established\r\nbetween the skin and the umbilicus, which effectually closes the\r\norifice. Special clamps are provided for taking up the fold of the skin\r\ncovering the hernial sac and holding it until the adhesion is formed.\r\n\r\nDIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA.--This consists of the passage of any of the\r\nabdominal viscera through a rent in the diaphragm (midriff) into the\r\ncavity of the thorax. It is a rather rare accident, and one often\r\nimpossible to diagnose during life. Colicky symptoms, accompanied with\r\ngreat difficulty in breathing, and the peculiar position so often\r\nassumed (that of sitting upon the haunches), are somewhat characteristic\r\nof this trouble, though these symptoms, as we have already seen, may be\r\npresent during diseases of the stomach or anterior portion of the\r\nbowels. Even could we diagnose with certainty this form of hernia, there\r\nis little or nothing that can be done. Leading the horse up a very steep\r\ngangway or causing him to rear up may possibly cause the hernial portion\r\nto return to its natural position. This is not enough, however; it must\r\nbe kept there.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERITONITIS.\r\n\r\nPeritonitis is an inflammation of the serous membrane lining the cavity\r\nof and covering the viscera contained within the abdomen. It is very\r\nrare to see a case of primary peritonitis. It is, however, somewhat\r\ncommon as a secondary disease from extension of the inflammatory action\r\ninvolving organs covered by the peritoneum. Peritonitis is often caused\r\nby injuries, as punctured wounds of the abdomen, severe blows or kicks,\r\nor, as is still more common, following the operation of castration. It\r\nfollows strangulated hernia, invagination, or rupture of the stomach,\r\nintestines, liver, or womb.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Peritonitis is mostly preceded by a chill; the horse is not\r\ndisposed to move, and, if compelled to do so, moves with a stiff or sore\r\ngait; he paws with the front feet and may strike at his belly with the\r\nhind ones; lies down very carefully; as the pain is increased while\r\ndown, he maintains the standing position during most of the time; he\r\nwalks uneasily about the stall. Constipation is usually present.\r\nPressure on the belly causes acute pain, and the horse will bite,\r\nstrike, or kick if so disturbed; the abdomen is tucked up; the\r\nextremities are fine and cold. The temperature is higher than normal,\r\nreaching from 102 deg. to 104 deg. F. The pulse in peritonitis is rather\r\ncharacteristic; it is quickened, beating from 70 to 90 beats a minute,\r\nand is hard and wiry. This peculiarity of the pulse occurs in\r\ninflammation of the serous membrane, and if accompanied with colicky\r\nsymptoms, and, in particular, if following any injuries, accidental or\r\nsurgical, of the peritoneum, there is reason to think that peritonitis\r\nis present. Peritonitis in the horse is mostly fatal when it is at all\r\nextensive. If death does not occur in a short time, the inflammation\r\nassumes a chronic form, in which there is an extensive effusion of water\r\nin the cavity of the belly, constituting what is known as ascites, and\r\nwhich, as a rule, results in death.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment of peritonitis is somewhat like that of\r\nenteritis. Opium in powder, 1 to 2 drams, with calomel, one-half dram,\r\nis to be given every two, three, or four hours, and constitutes the main\r\ndependence in this disease. Extensive counterirritants over the belly,\r\nconsisting of mustard plasters, applications of mercurial ointment,\r\nturpentine stupes, or even mild blisters, are recommended. Purgatives\r\nmust never be given during this complaint. Should we desire to move the\r\nbowels, it can be done by gentle enemas, though it is seldom necessary\r\nto resort even to this.\r\n\r\n\r\nASCITES, OR DROPSY OF THE ABDOMEN.\r\n\r\nThis is seen as a result of subacute or chronic peritonitis, but may be\r\ndue to diseases of the liver, kidneys, heart, or lungs. There will be\r\nfound, on opening the cavity of the belly, a large collection of\r\nyellowish or reddish liquid; from a few quarts to several gallons may be\r\npresent. It may be clear in color, though generally it is yellowish or\r\nof a red tint, and contains numerous loose flakes of coagulable lymph.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--There is slight tenderness on pressure; awkward gait of the\r\nhind legs; the horse is dull, and may have occasional very slight\r\ncolicky pains, shown by looking back and striking at the belly with the\r\nhind feet. Oftener, however, these colicky symptoms are absent. Diarrhea\r\noften precedes death, but during the progress of the disease the bowels\r\nare alternately constipated and loose. On percussing the abdominal walls\r\nwe find that dullness exists to the same height on both sides of the\r\nbelly; by suddenly pushing or striking the abdomen we can hear the\r\nrushing or flooding of water. If the case is an advanced one, the horse\r\nis potbellied in the extreme, and dropsical swellings are seen under the\r\nbelly and upon the legs.\r\n\r\nTreatment is, as a rule, unsatisfactory. Saline cathartics, as Epsom or\r\nGlauber's salt, and diuretics, ounce doses of saltpeter, may be given.\r\nIf a veterinarian is at hand he will withdraw the accumulation of water\r\nby tapping and then endeavor to prevent its recurrence (though this is\r\nalmost sure to follow) by giving three times a day saltpeter 1 ounce and\r\niodid of potash 1 dram, and by the application of mustard or blisters\r\nover the abdominal walls. Tonics, mineral and vegetable, are also\r\nindicated. Probably the best tonic is one consisting of powdered\r\nsulphate of iron, gentian, and ginger in equal parts; a heaping\r\ntablespoonful of the mixture is given as a drench or mixed with the\r\nfeed, twice a day. Good nutritious feeds and gentle exercise complete\r\nthe treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE LIVER.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the liver of the horse is but rarely the seat of\r\ndisease, and when we consider how frequently the liver of man is\r\naffected this can not but appear strange. The absence of the gall\r\nbladder may account to a certain extent for his freedom from liver\r\ndiseases, as overdistention of this and the presence in it of calculi\r\n(stones) in man is a frequent source of trouble. In domestic animals, as\r\nin man, hot climates tend to produce diseases of the liver, just as in\r\ncold climates lung diseases prevail. Not only are diseases of the liver\r\nrare in horses in temperate climates, but they are also very obscure,\r\nand in many cases pass totally unobserved until after death. There are\r\nsome symptoms, however, which, when present, should make us examine the\r\nliver as carefully as possible. These are jaundice (yellowness of the\r\nmucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and eyes) and the condition of the\r\ndung, it being light in color and pasty in appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEPATITIS, OR INFLAMMATION OF THE LIVER.\r\n\r\nThis disease may be general or local, and may assume an acute or chronic\r\nform.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms of acute hepatitis are: Dullness; the horse is\r\nsuffering from some internal pain, but not of a severe type; constipated\r\nand clay-colored dung balls; scanty and high-colored urine; and general\r\nfebrile symptoms. If lying down, he is mostly found on the left side;\r\nlooks occasionally toward the right side, which, upon close inspection,\r\nmay be found to be slightly enlarged over the posterior ribs, where pain\r\nupon pressure is also evinced. Obscure lameness in front, of the right\r\nleg mostly, may be a symptom of hepatitis. The horse, toward the last,\r\nreels or staggers in his gait and falls backward in a fainting fit,\r\nduring one of which he finally succumbs. Death is sometimes due to\r\nrupture of the enveloping coat of the liver or of some of its blood\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Among the causes that lead to this disease we must mention\r\nfirst the stimulating effect of overfeeding, particularly during hot\r\nweather. Horses that are well fed and receive but little exercise are\r\nthe best subjects for diseases of this organ. We must add to these\r\ncauses the more mechanical ones, as injuries on the right side over the\r\nliver, worms in the liver, gallstones in the biliary ducts, foreign\r\nbodies--as needles or nails that have been swallowed and in their\r\nwanderings have entered the liver--and, lastly, in some instances, the\r\nextension of inflammation from neighboring parts, thus involving this\r\norgan. Acute hepatitis may terminate in chronic inflammation, abscesses,\r\nrupture of the liver, or may disappear, leaving behind no trace of\r\ndisease whatever.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--This should consist, at first, of the administration of 1\r\nounce of Barbados aloes or other physic. General blood-letting, if had\r\nrecourse to early, must prove of much benefit in acute inflammation of\r\nthe liver. The vein in the neck (jugular) must be opened, and from 4 to\r\n6 quarts of blood may be drawn. Saline medicines, as Glauber's salt or\r\nthe artificial Carlsbad salt, are indicated. These may be given with the\r\nfeed in tablespoonful doses. The horse is to be fed sparingly on soft\r\nfeed, bran mashes chiefly. If treatment proves successful and recovery\r\ntakes place, see to it that the horse afterwards gets regular exercise\r\nand that his feed is not of a too highly nutritious character and not\r\nexcessive.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAUNDICE, ICTERUS, OR THE YELLOWS.\r\n\r\nThis is a condition caused by the retention and absorption of bile into\r\nthe blood. It was formerly considered to be a disease of itself, but is\r\nnow regarded as a symptom of disorder of the liver. \"The yellows\" is\r\nobserved by looking at the eyes, nose, and mouth, when it will be seen\r\nthat these parts are yellowish instead of the pale-pink color of health.\r\nIn white or light-colored horses the skin even may show this yellow\r\ntint. The urine is saffron colored, the dung is of a dirty-gray color,\r\nand constipation is usually present. Jaundice may be present as a\r\nsymptom of almost any inflammatory disease. We know that when an animal\r\nhas fever the secretions are checked, the bile may be retained and\r\nabsorbed throughout the system, and yellowness of the mucous membranes\r\nfollows. Jaundice may also exist during the presence of simple\r\nconstipation, hepatitis, biliary calculi, abscesses, hardening of the\r\nliver, etc.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--When jaundice exists we must endeavor to rid the system of\r\nthe excess of bile, and this is best accomplished by giving purgatives\r\nthat act upon the liver. Calomel, 2 drams, with aloes, 7 drams, should\r\nbe given. Glauber's salt in handful doses once or twice a day for a week\r\nis also effective. May apple, rhubarb, castor oil, and other cathartics\r\nthat act upon the first or small bowels may be selected. We must be\r\ncareful to see that the bowels are kept open by avoiding hard, dry,\r\nbulky feeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUPTURE OF THE LIVER.\r\n\r\nThis is known to occur at times in the horse, most frequently in old,\r\nfat horses and those that get but little exercise. Horses that have\r\nsuffered from chronic liver disease for years eventually present\r\nsymptoms of colic and die quite suddenly. Upon post-mortem examination\r\nwe discover that the liver has ruptured. The cicatrices, or scars, that\r\nare often found upon the liver indicate that this organ may suffer\r\n_small_ rupture and yet the horse may recover from it. This can not be\r\nthe result, however, if the rent or tear is extensive, since in such\r\ncases death must quickly follow from hemorrhage, or, later, from\r\nperitonitis. Enlarged liver is particularly liable to rupture.\r\n\r\nThe immediate causes of rupture appear to be excessive muscular\r\nexertion, as leaping a fence, a fall, a blow from a collision, a kick\r\nfrom a horse, or sudden distention of the abdomen with gas.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of rupture of the liver will depend upon the extent of the\r\nlaceration. If slight, there will be simply the symptoms of abdominal\r\npain, looking back to the sides, lying down, etc.; if extensive, the\r\nhorse is dull and dejected, has no appetite, breathing becomes short and\r\ncatching, he sighs or sobs, visible mucous membranes are pale,\r\nextremities cold, pulse fast, small, and weak or running down.\r\nCountenance now shows much distress, he sweats profusely, totters in his\r\ngait, props his legs wide apart, reels, staggers, and falls. He may get\r\nup again, but soon falls dead. The rapid running-down pulse, paleness of\r\nthe eyes, nose, and mouth, sighing, stertorous breathing, tottering\r\ngait, etc., are symptoms by which we know that the animal is dying from\r\ninternal hemorrhage.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--But little can be done in the way of treatment. Opium in\r\npowder, in doses of 2 drams every two or three hours, may be given, with\r\nthe idea of preventing as much as possible all movements of internal\r\norgans. If there is reason to suspect internal bleeding, we should give\r\nlarge and frequent doses of white-oak bark tea, dram doses of tannic or\r\ngallic acid, or the same quantity of sugar of lead, every half hour or\r\nhour. Fluid extract of ergot or tincture of the chlorid of iron, in\r\nounce doses, may be selected. Cold water dashed upon the right side or\r\ninjected into the rectum is highly spoken of as a means of checking the\r\nhemorrhage.\r\n\r\n\r\nBILIARY CALCULI, OR GALLSTONES.\r\n\r\nThese are rarely found in the horse, but may occupy the hepatic ducts,\r\ngiving rise to jaundice and to colicky pains. There are no absolutely\r\ndiagnostic symptoms, but should one find a horse that suffers from\r\nrepeated attacks of colic, accompanied with symptoms of violent pain,\r\nand that during or following these attacks the animal is jaundiced, it\r\nis possible that gallstones are present. There is little or nothing to\r\nbe done except to give medicines to overcome pain, trusting that these\r\nconcretions may pass on to the bowels, where, from their small size,\r\nthey will not occasion any inconvenience.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE PANCREAS AND SPLEEN.\r\n\r\nDiseases of the pancreas and spleen are so rare, or their symptoms so\r\nlittle understood, that it is impossible to write anything concerning\r\neither of these organs and their simple diseases that will convey to the\r\nreader information of practical value.\r\n\r\n\r\nGASTROINTESTINAL PARASITES.\r\n\r\n[By Maurice C. Hall, Ph. D., D. V. M.]\r\n\r\nHorses are subject to infestation by a number of species of worms, these\r\nworms being especially numerous at certain points in the alimentary\r\ncanal.\r\n\r\nThe tapeworms of the horse are relatively unimportant and not very\r\ncommon. There are three species, the smallest about two inches long and\r\nthe largest about eight inches long. These two occur in the small\r\nintestine; a form intermediate in size may also be found in the cecum\r\nand colon. These are flat, segmented worms with the head at the smaller\r\nend.\r\n\r\nFlukes occur in horses elsewhere, but have apparently never been\r\nreported in the United States.\r\n\r\nRoundworms, or nematodes, constitute the most important group of\r\nparasitic worms in the horse. The more important of these are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nROUNDWORM (_Ascaris equorum_).--This is the common large, yellowish\r\nroundworm (Pl. V, fig. 5), about the size of a lead pencil or larger,\r\nwhich may be found in horses almost anywhere in the United States. It\r\noccurs in the intestine and probably occasions little damage as a rule,\r\nexcept when present in large numbers, in which case it will probably be\r\nfound in the droppings. The symptoms occasioned by it are rather obscure\r\nand are such as might arise from a number of other causes, namely,\r\ncolicky pains, depraved appetite, diarrhea or constipation, and general\r\nunthriftiness. In a general way, the presence of parasites may be\r\nsuspected when an animal shows no fever but is unthrifty, debilitated,\r\nand shows disordered bowel movements in cases where there is no evident\r\nexplanation in the way of feed, care, and surroundings.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ for the removal of this worm consists in the use of\r\nanthelmintics such as tartar emetic, turpentine, and carbon bisulphid,\r\nbut as these remedies are essentially poisons intended to kill the worm,\r\nand as their use by persons unused to determining conditions unfavorable\r\nfor their use is dangerous and likely to result in the death of the\r\nanimal or in permanent injury to the kidneys or other organs, it is\r\nadvisable to call in a veterinarian in such cases.\r\n\r\nPINWORM (_Oxyuris equi_).--This is a rather large worm (Pl. V, fig. 1),\r\nsomewhat smaller than the foregoing and readily distinguishable from it\r\nby the presence of a long, slender tail. It also occurs generally\r\nthroughout the United States, and except when present in large numbers\r\nprobably does very little damage. It inhabits the large intestine and\r\nhence is difficult to reach with medicines administered by the mouth.\r\nThe use of a half ounce of gentian on the feed night and morning for a\r\nweek has been recommended, but the use of rectal enemas will give more\r\nprompt and perhaps more certain results. These enemas may be made up\r\nwith one or two tablespoonfuls of salt to the pint, or infusions of\r\nquassia chips, a half pound to the gallon of water, and injected into\r\nthe rectum once or twice a day.\r\n\r\nSTOMACH WORMS OF THE HORSE (_Habronema_ spp.).--These worms (Pl. V, fig.\r\n4) occur in nodules in the mucous lining of the horse's stomach and are\r\ncredited with doing more or less damage. Their presence is not likely to\r\nbe diagnosed in the present state of our knowledge, but in case their\r\npresence is determined or suspected in connection with the summer sores\r\nnoted later, tartar emetic is recommended. At least one of these worms\r\nhas an intermediate stage in the ordinary housefly, the fly becoming\r\ninfested while it is a larva developing in horse manure. Obviously,\r\ntherefore, any measures looking toward the eradication of the fly or the\r\nproper disposal of manure will aid in the control and eradication of\r\nthis worm. The United States Bureau of Entomology has shown that fly\r\nmaggots travel downward through a manure pile as it comes time for the\r\nmaggot to enter the ground and pupate, and an excellent maggot trap,\r\nconsisting of an exposed manure platform raised on posts which are set\r\nin a concrete basin extending under the platform and filled with three\r\nor four inches of water, has been devised. As maggots work down they\r\ncome to the platform and escape through the spaces between the boards,\r\nleft open for the purpose, to the water in the concrete basin, where\r\nthey are drowned. In this way the exposed manure pile serves to attract\r\nflies with a deceptive proffer of a breeding place.\r\n\r\nApparently it is the young forms of these stomach worms which develop at\r\ntimes on the skin, causing a cutaneous habronemiasis known as summer\r\nsores. This is discussed under diseases of the skin.\r\n\r\nSTRONGYLES (_Strongylus_ spp. and _Cylicostomum_ spp.).--These worms\r\n(Pl. V, figs. 2 and 3) live in the large intestines of the horse as\r\nadult worms and are often present in enormous numbers. Many of them are\r\nvery small, and the largest are less than two inches long. The adult\r\nworms do considerable damage, but the immature or larval worms do even\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThe larva of _Strongylus vulgaris_ enters the blood vessels of the\r\nintestinal wall and finally attaches in the great mesenteric artery,\r\nwhere it causes aneurisms; here it transforms to an adult without sexual\r\norgans, which passes to the walls of the cecum and encysts, giving rise\r\nto small cysts or abscesses; these cysts finally discharge to the\r\ninterior of the cecum, setting the worms, now mature, at liberty in the\r\nlumen of the intestines.\r\n\r\nThe larvae of _Strongylus equinus_ are found principally in the liver,\r\nlungs, and pancreas.\r\n\r\nThe larvae of _Strongylus edentatus_ may be met with almost anywhere,\r\nespecially under the serous membranes, the pleura and peritoneum.\r\n\r\nThe embryos and larvae of species of _Cylicostomum_ are found in the\r\nmucosa of the large intestine.\r\n\r\nAneurisms impede the circulation of the blood, and may give rise to\r\nintermittent lameness. The aneurism may rupture, since it constitutes a\r\nweak place in the wall of the blood vessel, and the horse die of the\r\nresulting hemorrhage. Particles of blood clots in the aneurisms may\r\nbreak off and plug a blood vessel at the point where they lodge, thereby\r\ncausing the death of the part from which the blood is shut off and\r\noccasioning a type of colic which often terminates fatally. The larvae of\r\n_Cylicostomum_ form cysts in the walls of the large intestine, and when\r\nthese open they give rise to small sores; when they are numerous they\r\ncause a thickening and hardening which impair the proper functioning of\r\nthe intestine. Abscesses sometimes perforate, causing death. The adult\r\nworm attacks the intestinal wall, causing bleeding which results in\r\nanemia. The numerous small sores thus caused allow bacteria to get into\r\nthe circulation, sometimes resulting in localized abscesses or in septic\r\narthritis or joint disease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V.\r\n\r\nINTESTINAL WORMS.\r\n\r\nOxyuris equi\r\n\r\nStrongylus equinus.\r\n\r\nHabronema microstoma\r\n\r\nCylichnostomum Sp.\r\n\r\nAscaris equorum]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI.\r\n\r\nBOTS\r\n\r\n1. Bots in the stomach.\r\n\r\n2. Bots in the duodenum.]\r\n\r\nThe disease due to these worms is quite common. The worms enter the body\r\nas immature forms in the spring, when the animal is turned out on\r\npasture. The first symptoms show in November or December, the disease\r\nbeing in a latent stage during the development of the worms. The first\r\nsymptoms are diarrhea, loss of appetite, and emaciation. The animal\r\nbecomes anemic. Secondary symptoms are edema and such complications as\r\njoint infection, colic due to embolism, and accidents from falls,\r\nhemorrhage from ruptured aneurisms, or perforation at the site of\r\nabscess. The animal may die, recover, or become a chronic sufferer, the\r\ninternal injuries failing to make a satisfactory recovery even with the\r\nremoval of the worms in chronic cases.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ calls for the expulsion of the adult worms from the\r\nintestine, the development of the body resistance to repair the damage\r\nwrought by the developing worms, and the combating of complications. For\r\nthe expulsion of the worms the use of carbon bisulphid in gelatin\r\ncapsules, 2 to 5 grams, according to the size of the patient, for five\r\ndays, followed by magnesium sulphate the sixth day, has been\r\nrecommended. Owing to the difficulty and danger in the administration of\r\ncarbon bisulphid in capsule, it is advisable to call in a veterinarian.\r\nTonic treatment consists in the subcutaneous administration of\r\nartificial serum and caffein. The various complications of bacterial\r\ninfection, colic, heart depression, etc., call for the attention of a\r\nveterinarian. Preventive measures consist in avoiding reinfection with\r\nworms so far as possible by using dry upland pasture in preference to\r\nlow, wet land, and by rotating pastures or rotation of the stock on a\r\ngiven pasture. Horses may be alternated with cattle, sheep, or hogs to\r\nadvantage, so far as parasites are concerned. Another feature, always of\r\nimportance, is the provision of a pure, potable drinking water.\r\n\r\nBOTS (_Gastrophilus_ spp.).--Bots (Pl. VI) are quite common in the\r\nstomach and upper part of the small intestine of the horse anywhere in\r\nthe United States, one kind being occasionally found in the rectum. They\r\nattach to that portion of the mucous lining of the stomach nearest the\r\nesophagus or sometimes around the pyloric opening to the intestine or\r\neven in the upper intestine, and undoubtedly interfere with the proper\r\nfunctioning of the stomach and the health of the animal to a certain\r\nextent. The symptoms are rather vague as a rule, but the general result\r\nis a condition of unthriftiness.\r\n\r\nA treatment which has been found effective consists in feeding lightly\r\non the day preceding treatment, withholding food in the evening and\r\ngiving an ounce of Barbados aloes or a pint of linseed oil. The next\r\nday give 3 drams of carbon bisulphid in a gelatin capsule at 6 o'clock,\r\nrepeat the dose at 7 o'clock, and again at 8 o'clock, making a total of\r\n9 drams altogether for an adult horse; half that amount will be\r\nsufficient for a yearling colt. As previously noted, there is some\r\nlittle difficulty and danger of accident in the administration of\r\ntreatments of this character and it is advisable to call in a\r\nveterinarian.\r\n\r\nUnless destroyed by treatment, the bots in the stomach of the horse pass\r\nout in the manure in the spring and burrow down into the soil an inch or\r\ntwo. Here they undergo a certain amount of development and finally\r\nemerge as adult flies. These bot flies mate and during the summer the\r\neggs are deposited by the female on the forelegs and shoulders or around\r\nthe chin, mouth and nostrils of the horse, the location and appearance\r\nof the eggs varying somewhat with different species of bot flies. These\r\neggs or the young maggots escaping from them are ingested by the horse\r\nin licking the portions irritated by the movement of the escaping\r\nmaggots, and when swallowed develop to form bots in the stomach. Careful\r\ncurrying, especially around the forequarters, is an aid in keeping down\r\nbot infestation, but this is not commonly feasible with horses on\r\npasture, the ones most liable to become infested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS.\r\n\r\nBy W. S. HARBAUGH, V. S.\r\n\r\n[Revised by Leonard Pearson, B. S., V. M. D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe organs pertaining to the respiratory function may be enumerated in\r\nnatural order as follows: The nasal openings, or nostrils; the nasal\r\nchambers, through which the air passes in the head; the sinuses in the\r\nhead, communicating with the nasal chambers; the pharynx, common to the\r\nfunctions of breathing and swallowing; the larynx, at the top of the\r\nwindpipe; the trachea, or windpipe; the bronchi (into which the windpipe\r\ndivides), two tubes leading from the windpipe to the right and left\r\nlungs, respectively; the bronchial tubes, which penetrate and convey air\r\nto all parts of the lungs; the lungs.\r\n\r\nThe pleura is a thin membrane that envelops the lung and lines the walls\r\nof the thoracic cavity. The diaphragm is a muscular structure,\r\ncompletely separating the contents of the thoracic cavity from those of\r\nthe abdominal cavity. It is essentially a muscle of inspiration, and the\r\nprincipal one. Other muscles aid in the mechanism of respiration, but\r\nthe diseases or injuries of them have nothing to do with the diseases\r\nunder consideration.\r\n\r\nJust within the nasal openings the skin becomes gradually but\r\nperceptibly finer, until it is succeeded by the mucous membrane. Near\r\nthe junction of the skin and membrane is a small hole, presenting the\r\nappearance of having been made with a punch; this is the opening of the\r\nlachrymal duct, a canal that conveys the tears from the eyes. Within and\r\nabove the nasal openings are the cavities, or fissures, called the false\r\nnostrils. The nasal chambers are completely separated, the right from\r\nthe left, by a cartilaginous partition, the nasal septum. Each nasal\r\nchamber is divided into three continuous compartments by two thin,\r\nscroll-like turbinated bones.\r\n\r\nThe mucous membrane lining the nasal chambers, and, in fact, the entire\r\nrespiratory tract, is much more delicate and more frequently diseased\r\nthat the mucous membrane of any other part of the body. The sinuses of\r\nthe head are compartments which communicate with the nasal chambers and\r\nare lined with a continuation of the same membrane that lines the nasal\r\nchambers; their presence increases the volume and modifies the form of\r\nthe head without increasing its weight.\r\n\r\nThe horse, in a normal condition, breathes exclusively through the\r\nnostrils. The organs of respiration are quite liable to become\r\ndiseased, and, as many of the causes which lead to these attacks can be\r\navoided, it is both important and profitable to know and study the\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF DISEASES OF RESPIRATORY ORGANS.\r\n\r\nThe causes of many of the diseases of these organs may be given under a\r\ncommon head, because even a simple cold, if neglected or badly treated,\r\nmay run into the most complicated lung disease and terminate fatally. In\r\nthe spring and fall, when the animals are changing their coats, there is\r\na marked predisposition to contract disease, and consequently at those\r\nperiods care should be taken to prevent other exciting causes.\r\n\r\nBadly ventilated stables are a frequent source of disease. It is a\r\nmistake to think that country stables necessarily have purer air than\r\ncity stables. Stables on some farms are so faultily constructed that it\r\nis almost impossible for the foul air to gain an exit. All stables\r\nshould have a sufficient supply of pure air, and be so arranged that\r\nstrong drafts can not blow directly on the animals. In ventilating a\r\nstable, it is best to arrange to remove air from near the floor and\r\nadmit it through numerous small openings near the ceiling. The reason\r\nfor this is that the coldest and most impure air in the stable is near\r\nthe floor, while that which is warmest and purest, and therefore can\r\nleast be spared, is near the top of the room. In summer, top exits and\r\ncross currents should be provided to remove excessive heat. Hot stables\r\nare almost always poorly ventilated, and the hot stable is a cause of\r\ndisease on account of the extreme change of temperature that a horse is\r\nliable to when taken out, and extreme changes of temperature are to be\r\navoided as certain causes of disease.\r\n\r\nA cold, close stable is invariably damp, and is to be avoided as much as\r\nthe hot, close, and foul one. Horses changed from a cold to a warm\r\nstable are more liable to contract cold than when changed from a warm to\r\na cold one. Pure air is more essential than warmth, and this fact should\r\nbe especially remembered when the stable is made close and foul to gain\r\nthe warmth. It is more economical to keep the horse warm with blankets\r\nthan to prevent the ingress of pure air in order to make the stable\r\nwarm.\r\n\r\nStables should be well drained and kept clean. Some farmers allow large\r\nquantities of manure to accumulate in the stable. This is a pernicious\r\npractice, as the decomposing organic matter evolves gases that are\r\npredisposing or exciting causes of disease. When a horse is overheated,\r\nit is not safe to allow him to dry by evaporation; rubbing him dry and\r\ngradually cooling him out is the wisest treatment. When a horse is\r\nhot--covered with sweat--it is dangerous to allow him to stand in a\r\ndraft; it is the best plan to walk him until his temperature moderates.\r\nIn such cases a light blanket thrown over the animal may prevent a cold.\r\nOverwork or overexertion often causes the greater number of fatal cases\r\nof congestion of the lungs. Avoid prolonged or fast work when the horse\r\nis out of condition or unaccustomed to it. Animals that have been\r\nworking in cold rains should be dried and cooled out and not left to dry\r\nby evaporation. When the temperature of the weather is at the extreme,\r\neither of heat or cold, diseases of the organs of respiration are most\r\nfrequent.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that farmers can give their horses the\r\nparticular attention given to valuable racing and pleasure horses, but\r\nthey can most assuredly give them common-sense care, and this may often\r\nsave the life of a valuable animal. If the owner properly considers his\r\ninterests, he will study the welfare of his horses so that he may be\r\nable to instruct the servant in details of stable management.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDS ABOUT THE NOSTRILS.\r\n\r\nWounds in this neighborhood are common, and are generally caused by\r\nsnagging on a nail or splinter or by the bite of another horse; or by\r\ngetting \"run into,\" or by running against something. Occasionally the\r\nnostril is so badly torn and lacerated that it is impossible to effect a\r\ncure without leaving the animal blemished for life, but in the majority\r\nof instances the blemish, or scar, is the result of want of conservative\r\ntreatment. As soon as possible after the accident the parts should be\r\nbrought together and held there by stitches. If too much time is allowed\r\nto elapse, the swelling of the parts will considerably interfere. Never\r\ncut away any skin that may be loose and hanging, or else a scar will\r\ncertainly remain. Bring the parts in direct apposition and place the\r\nstitches from a quarter to a half-inch apart, as circumstances may\r\ndemand. It is not necessary to have special surgeons' silk and needles\r\nfor this operation; good linen thread or ordinary silk thread will\r\nanswer. The wound afterwards only requires to be kept clean. For this\r\npurpose it should be cleansed and discharges washed away daily with a\r\nsolution made of carbolic acid 1 part in 40 parts of water. If on\r\naccount of the irritability the horse is inclined to rub the wound\r\nagainst some object, his head should be tied by means of two halter\r\nropes attached to the opposite sides of the stall to prevent him from\r\nopening the wound. Except when at work or eating, the head should be so\r\ntied about 10 days.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUMORS WITHIN THE NOSTRILS.\r\n\r\nA small, globular tumor is sometimes found within the false nostril,\r\nunder that part of the skin that is seen to puff or rise and fall when a\r\nhorse is exerted and breathing hard. These tumors contain matter of a\r\ncheesy consistency.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--If the tumor is well opened and the matter squeezed out,\r\nnature will perform a cure. If the opening is made from the outside\r\nthrough the skin, it should be at the most dependent part, but much the\r\nbest way to open the tumor is from the inside. Quiet the animal, gently\r\ninsert your finger up in the direction of the tumor, and you will soon\r\ndiscover that it is much larger inside than it appears to be on the\r\noutside. If necessary put a twitch on the ear of the horse to quiet him;\r\nrun the index finger of your left hand against the tumor; now, with the\r\nright hand, carefully insert the knife by running the back of the blade\r\nalong the index finger of the left hand until the tumor is reached; with\r\nthe left index finger guide the point of the blade quickly and surely\r\ninto the tumor; make the opening large. A little blood may flow for a\r\nwhile, but it is of no consequence. Squeeze out the matter and keep the\r\npart clean.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLD IN THE HEAD, OR NASAL CATARRH.\r\n\r\nCatarrh is an inflammation of a mucous membrane. It is accompanied with\r\nexcessive secretion. In nasal catarrh the inflammation may extend from\r\nthe membrane lining the nose to the throat, the inside of the sinuses,\r\nand to the eyes. The causes are the general causes of respiratory\r\ndisease enumerated above. It is especially common in young horses and in\r\nhorses not acclimated.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The membrane at the beginning of the attack is dry,\r\ncongested, and irritable; it is of a deeper hue than natural, pinkish\r\nred or red. Soon a watery discharge from the nostrils makes its\r\nappearance; the eyes may also be more or less affected and tears flow\r\nover the cheeks. The animal has some fever, which may be easily detected\r\nby means of a clinical thermometer inserted in the rectum or, roughly,\r\nby placing the finger in the mouth, as the feeling of heat conveyed to\r\nthe finger will be greater than natural.\r\n\r\nTo become somewhat expert in ascertaining the changes of temperature in\r\nthe horse it is only necessary to place the finger often in the mouths\r\nof horses known to be healthy. After you have become accustomed to the\r\nwarmth of the mouth of the healthy animal you will have no difficulty in\r\ndetecting a marked increase of the temperature. The animal may be dull;\r\nhe sneezes or snorts, but does not cough unless the throat is affected;\r\nhe expels the air forcibly through his nostrils, very often in a manner\r\nthat may be aptly called \"blowing his nose.\" A few days after the attack\r\nbegins the discharge from the nostrils changes from a watery to that of\r\na thick, mucilaginous state, of a yellowish-white color, and may be more\r\nor less profuse. Often the appetite is lost and the animal becomes\r\ndebilitated.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--This disease is not serious, but inasmuch as neglect or\r\nbad treatment may cause it to lead to something worse or become chronic\r\nit should receive proper attention. The animal should not be worked for\r\na time. A few days of rest, with pure air and good feed, will be of\r\ngreater benefit than most medication. The value of pure air can not be\r\noverestimated, but drafts must be avoided. The benefit derived from the\r\ninhalation of steam is considerable. This is effected by holding the\r\nhorse's head over a bucketful of boiling water, so that the animal will\r\nbe compelled to inhale steam with every inhalation of air. Stirring the\r\nhot water with a wisp of hay causes the steam to arise in greater\r\nabundance. One may cause the horse to put his nose in a bag containing\r\ncut hay upon which hot water has been poured, the bottom of the bag\r\nbeing stood in a bucket, but the bag must be of loose texture, as gunny\r\nsack, or, if of canvas, holes must be cut in the side to admit fresh\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThe horse may be made to inhale steam four or five times a day, about 15\r\nor 20 minutes each time.\r\n\r\nParticular attention should be paid to the diet. Give bran mashes,\r\nscalded oats, linseed gruel, and grass, if in season. If the horse\r\nevinces no desire for this soft diet, it is better to allow any kind of\r\nfeed he will eat, such as hay, oats, corn, etc., than to keep him on\r\nshort rations.\r\n\r\nIf the animal is constipated, relieve this symptom by injections\r\n(enemas) of warm water into the rectum three or four times a day, but do\r\nnot administer purgative medicines, except of a mild character.\r\n\r\nFor simple cases the foregoing is all that is required, but if the\r\nappetite is lost and the animal appears debilitated and dull, give 3\r\nounces of the solution of acetate of ammonia and 2 drams of powdered\r\nchlorate of potassium diluted with a pint of water three times a day as\r\na drench. Be careful when giving the drench; do not pound the horse on\r\nthe gullet to make him swallow; be patient, and take time, and do it\r\nright.\r\n\r\nIf the weather is cold, blanket the animal and keep him in a comfortable\r\nstall. If the throat is sore, treat as advised for that ailment, to be\r\ndescribed hereafter.\r\n\r\nIf, after 10 days or 2 weeks, the discharge from the nostrils continues,\r\ngive one-half dram of reduced iron three times a day. This may be mixed\r\nwith damp feed. Common cold should be thoroughly understood and\r\nintelligently treated in order to prevent more dangerous diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONIC CATARRH (OR NASAL GLEET, OR COLLECTION IN THE SINUSES).\r\n\r\nThis is a subacute or chronic inflammation of some part of the membrane\r\naffected in common cold, the disease just described. It is manifested by\r\na persistent discharge of a thick white or yellowish-white matter from\r\none or both nostrils. The commonest cause is a neglected or badly\r\ntreated cold, and it usually follows those cases where the horse has\r\nsuffered exposure, been overworked, or has not received proper feed,\r\nand, as a consequence, has become debilitated. It may occur as a sequel\r\nto influenza.\r\n\r\nOther but less frequent causes for this affection are: Fractures of the\r\nbones that involve the membrane of the sinuses, and even blows on the\r\nhead over the sinuses. Diseased teeth often involve a sinus and cause a\r\nfetid discharge from the nostril. Violent coughing is said to have\r\nforced particles of feed into the sinus, which acted as a cause of the\r\ndisease. Tumors growing in the sinuses are known to have caused it. It\r\nis also attributed to disease of the turbinated bones. Absorption of the\r\nbones forming the walls of the sinuses has been caused by the pressure\r\nof pus collecting in them and by tumors filling up the cavity.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Great caution must be exercised when examining these cases,\r\nfor the horse may have glanders, while, on the other hand, horses have\r\nbeen condemned as glandered when really there was nothing ailing them\r\nbut nasal gleet. This is not contagious, but may stubbornly resist\r\ntreatment and last for a long time. In most cases the discharge is from\r\none nostril only, which may signify that the sinuses on that side of the\r\nhead are affected. The discharge may be intermittent; that is,\r\nquantities may be discharged at times and again little or none for a day\r\nor so. Such an intermittent discharge usually signifies disease of the\r\nsinuses. The glands under and between the bones of the lower jaw may be\r\nenlarged. The peculiar ragged-edged ulcer of glanders is not to be found\r\non the membrane within the nostrils, but occasionally sores are to be\r\nseen there. If there is any doubt about it, the symptoms of glanders\r\nshould be well studied in order that one may be competent to form a safe\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nThe eye on the side of the discharging nostril may have a peculiar\r\nappearance and look smaller than its fellow. There may be an\r\nenlargement, having the appearance of a bulging out of the bone over the\r\npart affected, between or below the eyes. The breath may be offensive,\r\nwhich indicates decomposition of the matter or bones or disease of the\r\nteeth. A diseased tooth is further indicated by the horse holding his\r\nhead to one side when eating, or by dropping the feed from the mouth\r\nafter partly chewing it. When the bones between the eyes, below the\r\neyes, and above the back teeth of the upper jaw are tapped on, a hollow,\r\ndrumlike sound is emitted, but if the sinus is filled with pus or\r\ncontains a large tumor the sound emitted will be the same as if a solid\r\nsubstance were struck; by this means the sinus affected may be located\r\nin some instances. The hair may be rough over the affected part, or even\r\nthe bone may be soft to the touch and the part give somewhat to pressure\r\nor leave an impression where it is pressed upon with the finger.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The cause of the trouble must be ascertained before\r\ntreatment is commenced. In the many cases in which the animal is in poor\r\ncondition (in fact, in all cases) he should have the most nutritive feed\r\nand regular exercise. The feed, or box containing it, should be placed\r\non the ground, as the dependent position of the head favors the\r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\nThe cases that do not require a surgical operation must, as a rule, have\r\npersistent medical treatment. Mineral tonics and local medication are of\r\nthe most value. For eight days give the following mixture: Reduced iron,\r\n3 ounces; powdered nux vomica, 1 ounce. Mix and make into 16 powders;\r\none powder should be mixed with the feed twice a day. Arsenious acid\r\n(white arsenic) in doses of from 3 to 6 grains three times daily is a\r\ngood tonic for such cases. Sulphur burnt in the stable while the animal\r\nis there to inhale its fumes is also a valuable adjunct. Care should be\r\ntaken that the fumes of the burning sulphur are sufficiently diluted\r\nwith air so as not to suffocate the horse. Chlorid of lime sprinkled\r\naround the stall is good. Also keep a quantity of it under the hay in\r\nthe manger so that the gases will be inhaled as the horse holds his head\r\nover the hay while eating. Keep the nostrils washed and the discharge\r\ncleaned away from the manger and stall. The horse may be caused to\r\ninhale the vapor of compound tincture of benzoin by pouring 2 ounces of\r\nthis drug into hot water and fumigating in the usual way.\r\n\r\nIf the nasal gleet is the result of a diseased tooth, the latter must be\r\nremoved. Trephining is the best possible way to remove it in such cases,\r\nas the operation immediately opens the cavity, which can be attended to\r\ndirect. In all those cases of nasal gleet in which sinuses contain\r\neither tumors or collections of pus the only relief is by the trephine;\r\nand, no matter how thoroughly described, this is an operation that will\r\nbe seldom attempted by the nonprofessional. It would therefore be a\r\nwaste of time to give the modus operandi.\r\n\r\nAn abscess involving the turbinated bones is similar to the collection\r\nof pus in the sinuses and must be relieved by trephining.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHICKENING OF THE NASAL MEMBRANE.\r\n\r\nThis is sometimes denoted by a chronic discharge, a snuffling in the\r\nbreathing, and a contraction of the nostril. It is a result of common\r\ncold and requires the same treatment as prescribed for nasal gleet,\r\nnamely, the sulphate of iron, sulphate of copper, iodid of potassium,\r\netc. The membranes of both sides may be affected, but one side only is\r\nthe rule; the affected side may be easily detected by holding the hand\r\ntightly over one nostril at a time. When the healthy side is closed in\r\nthis manner the breathing through the affected side will demonstrate a\r\ndecreased caliber or an obstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nNASAL POLYPUS.\r\n\r\nTumors with narrow bases (somewhat pear-shaped) are occasionally found\r\nattached to the membrane of the nasal chambers, and are obstructions to\r\nbreathing through the side in which they are located. They vary much in\r\nsize; some are so small that their presence is not manifested, while\r\nothers almost completely fill the chamber, thereby causing a serious\r\nobstruction to the passage of air. The stem, or base, of the tumor is\r\ngenerally attached high in the chamber, and usually the tumor can not be\r\nseen, but occasionally it increases in size until it can be observed\r\nwithin the nostril. Sometimes, instead of hanging down toward the nasal\r\nopening, it falls back into the pharynx. It causes a discharge from the\r\nnostril, a more or less noisy snuffling sound in breathing, according to\r\nits size, a discharge of blood (if it is injured), and sneezing. The\r\nside that it occupies can be detected in the same way as described for\r\nthe detection of the affected side when the breathing is obstructed by a\r\nthickened membrane.\r\n\r\nThe only relief is removal of the polypus, which, like all other\r\noperations, should be done by an expert when it is possible to obtain\r\none. The operation is performed by grasping the base of the tumor with\r\nsuitable forceps and twisting it round and round until it is torn from\r\nits attachment, or by cutting it off with a noose of wire. The resulting\r\nhemorrhage is checked by the use of an astringent lotion, such as a\r\nsolution of the tincture of iron, or by packing the nostrils with\r\nsurgeon's gauze.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHARYNGEAL POLYPUS.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly the same kind of tumor described as nasal polypus, the\r\nonly difference being in the situation. Indeed, the stem of the tumor\r\nmay be attached to the membrane of the nasal chamber, as before\r\nexplained, or it may be attached in the fauces (opening of the back part\r\nof the mouth), and the body of the tumor then falls into the pharynx. In\r\nthis situation it may seriously interfere with breathing. Sometimes it\r\ndrops into the larynx, causing the most alarming symptoms. The animal\r\ncoughs, or tries to cough, saliva flows from the mouth, the breathing is\r\nperformed with the greatest difficulty and accompanied with a loud\r\nnoise; the animal appears as if strangled and often falls exhausted.\r\nWhen the tumor is coughed out of the larynx the animal regains quickly\r\nand soon appears as if nothing were ailing. These sudden attacks and\r\nquick recoveries point to the nature of the trouble. The examination\r\nmust be made by holding the animal's mouth open with a balling iron or\r\nspeculum and running the hand back into the mouth. If the tumor is\r\nwithin reach, it must be removed in the same manner as though it were in\r\nthe nose.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLEEDING FROM THE NOSE.\r\n\r\nThis often occurs during the course of certain diseases, namely,\r\ninfluenza, bronchitis, purpura hemorrhagica, glanders, etc. But it also\r\noccurs independently of other affections and, as before mentioned, is a\r\nsymptom of polypus, or tumor, in the nose.\r\n\r\nInjuries to the head, exertion, violent sneezing--causing a rupture of a\r\nsmall blood vessel--also induce it. The bleeding is almost invariably\r\nfrom one nostril only, and is never very serious. The blood escapes in\r\ndrops (seldom in a stream) and is not frothy, as when the hemorrhage is\r\nfrom the lungs. (See Bleeding from the lungs, p. 127.) In most cases\r\nbathing the head and washing out the nostril with cold water are all\r\nthat is necessary. If the cause is known, you will be guided according\r\nto circumstances. If the bleeding continues, pour ice-cold water over\r\nthe face, between the eyes and down over the nasal chambers. A bag\r\ncontaining ice in small pieces applied to the head is often efficient.\r\nIf in spite of these measures the hemorrhage continues, plugging the\r\nnostrils with cotton, tow, or oakum, should be tried. A string should be\r\ntied around the plug before it is pushed up into the nostril, so that it\r\ncan be safely withdrawn after 4 or 5 hours. If both nostrils are\r\nbleeding, only one nostril at a time should be plugged. If the\r\nhemorrhage is profuse and persistent, a drench composed of 1 dram of\r\nacetate of lead dissolved in 1 pint of water, or ergot, 1 ounce, should\r\nbe given.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE PHARYNX.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the pharynx is common to the functions of both\r\nrespiration and alimentation. From this organ the air passes into the\r\nlarynx and thence onward to the lungs. In the posterior part of the\r\npharynx is the superior extremity of the gullet, the canal through which\r\nthe feed and water pass to the stomach. Inflammation of the pharynx is a\r\ncomplication of other diseases--namely, influenza, strangles, etc.--and\r\nis probably always more or less complicated with inflammation of the\r\nlarynx. That it may exist as an independent affection there is no reason\r\nto doubt, and it is discussed as such with the diseases of the digestive\r\ntract.\r\n\r\n\r\nSORE THROAT, OR LARYNGITIS.\r\n\r\nThe larynx is situated in the space between the lower jawbones just back\r\nof the root of the tongue. It may be considered as a box (somewhat\r\ndepressed on each side), composed principally of cartilages and small\r\nmuscles, and lined on the inside with a continuation of the respiratory\r\nmucous membrane. Posteriorly it opens into and is continuous with the\r\nwindpipe. It is the organ of the voice, the vocal cords being situated\r\nwithin it; but in the horse this function is of little consequence. It\r\ndilates and contracts to a certain extent, thus regulating the volume of\r\nair passing through it. The mucous membrane lining it internally is so\r\nhighly sensitive that if the smallest particle of feed happens to drop\r\ninto it from the pharynx violent coughing ensues instantly and is\r\ncontinued until the source of irritation is ejected. This is a provision\r\nof nature to prevent foreign substances gaining access to the lungs.\r\nThat projection called Adam's apple in the neck of man is the prominent\r\npart of one of the cartilages forming the larynx.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the larynx is a serious and sometimes fatal disease,\r\nand, as before stated, is usually complicated with inflammation of the\r\npharynx, constituting what is popularly known as \"sore throat.\" The\r\nchief causes are chilling and exposure.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--About the first symptom noticed is cough, followed by\r\ndifficulty in swallowing, which may be due to soreness of the membrane\r\nof the pharynx, over which the feed or water must pass, or from the pain\r\ncaused by the contraction of the muscles necessary to impel the feed or\r\nwater onward to the gullet; or this same contraction of the muscles may\r\ncause a pressure on the larynx and produce pain. In many instances the\r\ndifficulty in swallowing is so great that water, and in some cases feed,\r\nis returned through the nose. This, however, does not occur in\r\nlaryngitis alone, but only when the pharynx is involved in the\r\ninflammation. The glands between the lower jawbones and below the ears\r\nmay be swollen. Pressure on the larynx induces coughing. The head is\r\nmore or less \"poked out,\" and has the appearance of being stiffly\r\ncarried. The membrane in the nose becomes red. A discharge from the\r\nnostrils soon appears. As the disease advances, the breathing may assume\r\na more or less noisy character; sometimes a harsh, rasping snore is\r\nemitted with every respiration, the breathing becomes hurried, and\r\noccasionally the animal seems threatened with suffocation.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In all cases steam the nostrils, as has been advised for\r\ncold in the head. In bad cases cause the steam to be inhaled\r\ncontinuously for hours--until relief is afforded. Have a bucketful of\r\nfresh boiling water every fifteen or twenty minutes. In each bucketful\r\nof water put a tablespoonful of oil of turpentine, or compound tincture\r\nof benzoin, the vapor of which will be carried along with the steam to\r\nthe affected parts and have a beneficial effect. In mild cases steaming\r\nthe nostrils five, six, or seven times a day will suffice.\r\n\r\nThe animal should be placed in a comfortable, dry stall (a box stall\r\npreferred), and should have pure air to breathe. The body should be\r\nblanketed, and bandages applied to the legs. The diet should consist of\r\nsoft feed--bran mashes, scalded oats, linseed gruel, and, best of all,\r\nfresh grass, if in season. The manger, or trough, should neither be too\r\nhigh nor too low, but a temporary one should be constructed at about\r\nthe height he carries his head. Having to reach too high or too low may\r\ncause so much pain that the animal would rather forego satisfying what\r\nlittle appetite he may have than inflict pain by craning his head for\r\nfeed or water. A supply of fresh water should be before him all the\r\ntime; he will not drink too much, nor will the cold water hurt him.\r\nConstipation (if present) must be relieved by enemas of warm water,\r\nadministered three or four times during the twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nA liniment composed of 2 ounces of olive oil and 1 each of solution of\r\nammonia and tincture of cantharides, well shaken together, may be\r\nthoroughly rubbed in about the throat from ear to ear, and about 6\r\ninches down over the windpipe, and in the space between the lower jaws.\r\nThis liniment should be applied once a day for two or three days.\r\n\r\nIf the animal is breathing with great difficulty, persevere in steaming\r\nthe nostrils, and dissolve 2 drams of chlorate of potassium in every\r\ngallon of water he will drink; even if he can not swallow much of it,\r\nand even if it is returned through the nostrils, it will be of some\r\nbenefit to the pharynx as a gargle.\r\n\r\nAn electuary of acetate of potash, 2 drams, honey, and licorice powder\r\nmay be spread on the teeth with a paddle every few hours. If the pain of\r\ncoughing is great, 2 or 3 grains of morphin may be added to the\r\nelectuary.\r\n\r\nWhen the breathing begins to be loud, relief is afforded in some cases\r\nby giving a drench composed of 2 drams of fluid extract of jaborandi in\r\nhalf a pint of water. If benefit is derived, this drench may be repeated\r\nfour or five hours after the first dose is given. It will cause a free\r\nflow of saliva from the mouth.\r\n\r\nIn urgent cases, when suffocation seems inevitable, the operation of\r\ntracheotomy must be performed. To describe this operation in words that\r\nwould make it comprehensible to the general reader is a more difficult\r\ntask than performing the operation, which, in the hands of the expert,\r\nis simple and attended with little danger.\r\n\r\nThe operator should be provided with a tracheotomy tube (to be purchased\r\nfrom any veterinary instrument maker) and a sharp knife, a sponge, and a\r\nbucket of clean cold water. The place to be selected for opening the\r\nwindpipe is that part which is found, upon examination, to be least\r\ncovered with muscles, about 5 or 6 inches below the throat. Right here,\r\nthen, is the place to cut through. Have an assistant hold the animal's\r\nhead still. Grasp your knife firmly in the right hand, select the spot\r\nand make the cut from above to below directly on the median line on the\r\nanterior surface of the windpipe. Make the cut about 2 inches long in\r\nthe windpipe; this necessitates cutting three or four rings. One bold\r\nstroke is usually sufficient, but if it is necessary to make several\r\nother cuts to finish the operation, do not hesitate. Your purpose is to\r\nmake a hole in the windpipe sufficiently large to admit the tracheotomy\r\ntube. It is quickly manifested when the windpipe is severed; the hot air\r\nrushes out, and when air is taken in it is sucked in with a noise. A\r\nslight hemorrhage may result (it never amounts to much), which is easily\r\ncontrolled by washing the wound with a sponge and cold water, but use\r\ncare not to get any water in the windpipe. Do not neglect to instruct\r\nyour assistant to hold the head down immediately after the operation, so\r\nthat the neck will be in a horizontal line. This will prevent the blood\r\nfrom getting into the windpipe and will allow it to drop directly on the\r\nground. If you have the self-adjustable tube, it retains its place in\r\nthe wound without further trouble after it is inserted. The other kind\r\nrequires to be secured in position by means of two tapes or strings tied\r\naround the neck. After the hemorrhage is somewhat abated, sponge the\r\nblood away and see that the tube is thoroughly clean, then insert it,\r\ndirecting the tube downward toward the lungs.\r\n\r\nThe immediate relief this operation affords is gratifying to behold. The\r\nanimal, a few minutes before on the verge of death from suffocation,\r\nemitting a loud wheezing sound with every breath, with haggard\r\ncountenance, body swaying, pawing, gasping, fighting for breath, now\r\nbreathes tranquilly, and may be in search of something to eat.\r\n\r\nThe tube should be removed once a day and cleaned with carbolic-acid\r\nsolution (1 to 20), and the discharge washed away from the wound with a\r\nsolution of carbolic acid, 1 part to 40 parts water. Several times a day\r\nthe hand should be held over the opening in the tube to test the\r\nanimal's ability to breathe through the nostrils, and as soon as it is\r\ndemonstrated that breathing can be performed in the natural way the tube\r\nshould be removed, the wound thoroughly cleansed with carbolic-acid\r\nsolution (1 to 40), and closed by inserting four or five stitches\r\nthrough the skin and muscle. Do not include the cartilages of the\r\nwindpipe in the stitches. Apply the solution to the wound three or four\r\ntimes a day until healed. When the tube is removed to clean it the lips\r\nof the wound may be pressed together to ascertain whether or not the\r\nhorse can breathe through the larynx. The use of the tube should be\r\ndiscontinued as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nIt is true that tracheotomy tubes are seldom to be found on farms, and\r\nespecially when most urgently required. In such instances there is\r\nnothing left to be done but, with a strong needle, pass a waxed end or\r\nother strong string through each side of the wound, including the\r\ncartilage of the windpipe, and keep the wound open by tying the strings\r\nover the neck.\r\n\r\nDuring the time the tube is used the other treatment advised must not be\r\nneglected. After a few days the discharge from the nostrils becomes\r\nthicker and more profuse. This is a good symptom and signifies that the\r\nacute stage has passed. At any time during the attack, if the horse\r\nbecomes weak, give whisky or aromatic spirits of ammonia, 2 ounces in\r\nwater. Do not be in a hurry to put the animal back to work, but give\r\nplenty of time for a complete recovery. Gentle and gradually increasing\r\nexercise may be given as soon as the horse is able to stand it. The feed\r\nshould be carefully selected and of good quality. Tonics, as iron or\r\narsenic, may be employed.\r\n\r\nIf abscesses form in connection with the disease they must be opened to\r\nallow the escape of pus, but do not rashly plunge a knife into swollen\r\nglands; wait until you are certain the swelling contains pus. The\r\nformation of pus may be encouraged by the constant application of\r\npoultices for hours at a time. The best poultice for the purpose is made\r\nof linseed meal, with sufficient hot water to make a thick paste. If the\r\nglands remain swollen for some time after the attack, rub well over them\r\nan application of the following: Biniodid of mercury, 1 dram; lard, 1\r\nounce; mix well. This may be applied once every day until the part is\r\nblistered.\r\n\r\nSore throat is also a symptom of other diseases, such as influenza,\r\nstrangles, purpura hemorrhagica, etc., which diseases may be consulted\r\nunder their proper headings.\r\n\r\nAfter a severe attack of inflammation of the larynx the mucous membrane\r\nmay be left in a thickened condition, or an ulceration of the part may\r\nensue, either of which is liable to produce a chronic cough. For the\r\nulceration it is useless to prescribe, because it can neither be\r\ndiagnosed nor topically treated by the nonprofessional.\r\n\r\nIf a chronic cough remains after all the other symptoms have\r\ndisappeared, it is advisable to give 1 dram of iodid of potassium\r\ndissolved in a bucketful of drinking water, one hour before feeding,\r\nthree times a day for a month if necessary. Also rub in well the\r\npreparation of iodid of mercury (as advised for the swollen glands)\r\nabout the throat, from ear to ear, and in the space between the lower\r\njawbones. The application may be repeated every third day until the part\r\nis blistered.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPASM OF THE LARYNX.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms are as follows: Sudden seizure by a violent fit of\r\ncoughing; the horse may reel and fall, and after a few minutes recover\r\nand be as well as ever. The treatment recommended is this: Three drams\r\nof bromid of potassium three times a day, dissolved in the drinking\r\nwater, or give as a drench in about a half pint of water for a week.\r\nThen give 1 dram of powdered nux vomica (either on the food or shaken\r\nwith water as a drench) once a day for a few weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROUP AND DIPHTHERIA.\r\n\r\nNeither of these diseases affects the horse, but these names are\r\nsometimes wrongly applied to severe laryngitis or pharyngitis, or to\r\nforage poisoning, in which the throat is paralyzed and becomes\r\nexcessively inflamed and gangrenous.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHICK WIND AND ROARING.\r\n\r\nHorses that are affected with chronic disease that causes a loud,\r\nunnatural noise in breathing are said to have thick wind, or to be\r\nroarers. This class does not include those affected with severe sore\r\nthroat, as in these cases the breathing is noisy only during the attack\r\nof the acute disease.\r\n\r\nThick wind is caused by an obstruction to the free passage of the air in\r\nsome part of the respiratory tract. Nasal polypi, thickening of the\r\nmembrane, pharyngeal polypi, deformed bones, paralysis of the wing of\r\nthe nostril, etc., are occasional causes. The noisy breathing of horses\r\nafter having been idle and put to sudden exertion is not due to any\r\ndisease and is only temporary. Very often a nervous, excitable horse\r\nwill make a noise for a short time when started off, generally caused by\r\nthe cramped position in which the head and neck are forced in order to\r\nhold him back.\r\n\r\nMany other causes may occasion temporary, intermittent, or permanent\r\nnoisy respiration, but chronic roaring is caused by paralysis of the\r\nmuscles of the larynx; and almost invariably it is the muscles of the\r\nleft side of the larynx that are affected.\r\n\r\nIn chronic roaring the noise is made when the air is drawn into the\r\nlungs; only when the disease is far advanced is a sound produced when\r\nthe air is expelled, and even then it is not nearly so loud as during\r\ninspiration.\r\n\r\nIn a normal condition the muscles dilate the aperture of the larynx by\r\nmoving the cartilage and vocal cord outward, allowing a sufficient\r\nvolume of air to rush through. But when the muscles are paralyzed the\r\ncartilage and vocal cord that are normally controlled by the affected\r\nmuscles lean into the tube of the larynx, so that when the air rushes in\r\nit meets this obstruction and the noise is produced. When the air is\r\nexpelled from the lungs its very force pushes the cartilage and vocal\r\ncords out, and consequently noise is not produced in the expiratory act.\r\n\r\nThe paralysis of the muscles is due to derangement of the nerve that\r\nsupplies them with energy. The muscles of both sides are not supplied by\r\nthe same nerve; there is a right and a left nerve, each supplying its\r\nrespective side. The reason why the muscles on the left side are the\r\nones usually paralyzed is owing to the difference in the anatomical\r\narrangement of the nerves. The left nerve is much longer and more\r\nexposed to interference than the right nerve.\r\n\r\nIn chronic roaring there is no evidence of any disease of the larynx\r\nother than the wasted condition of the muscles in question. The disease\r\nof the nerve is generally far from the larynx. Disease of parts\r\ncontiguous to the nerve along any part of its course may interfere with\r\nits proper function. Enlargement of lymphatic glands within the chest\r\nthrough which the nerve passes on its way back to the larynx is the most\r\nfrequent interruption of nervous supply, and consequently roaring. When\r\nroaring becomes confirmed, medical treatment is entirely useless, as it\r\nis impossible to restore the wasted muscle and at the same time remove\r\nthe cause of the interruption of the nervous supply. Before roaring\r\nbecomes permanent the condition may be benefited by a course of iodid of\r\npotassium, if caused by disease of the lymphatic glands. Electricity has\r\nbeen used with indifferent success. Blistering or firing over the larynx\r\nis, of course, not worthy of trial if the disease is due to interference\r\nof the nerve supply. The administration of strychnia (nux vomica) on the\r\nground that it is a nerve tonic with the view of stimulating the\r\naffected muscles is treating only the result of the disease without\r\nconsidering the cause, and is therefore useless. The operation of\r\nextirpating the collapsed cartilage and vocal cord is believed to be the\r\nonly relief, and, as this operation is critical and can be performed\r\nonly by the skillful veterinarian, it will not be described here.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing description of the disease it will be seen that the\r\nname \"roaring,\" by which the disease is generally known, is only a\r\nsymptom and not the disease. Chronic roaring is also in many cases\r\naccompanied with a cough. The best way to test whether a horse is a\r\n\"roarer\" is either to make him pull a load rapidly up a hill or over a\r\nsandy road or soft ground; or, if he is a saddle horse, gallop him up a\r\nhill or over soft ground. The object is to make him exert himself. Some\r\nhorses require a great deal more exertion than others before the\r\ncharacteristic sound is emitted. The greater the distance he is forced,\r\nthe more he will appear exhausted if he is a roarer; in bad cases the\r\nanimal becomes utterly exhausted, the breathing is rapid and difficult,\r\nthe nostrils dilate to the fullest extent, and the animal appears as if\r\nsuffocation was imminent.\r\n\r\nAn animal that is a roarer should not be used for breeding purposes. The\r\ntaint is transmissible in many instances.\r\n\r\n_Grunting._--A common test used by veterinarians when examining \"the\r\nwind\" of a horse is to see if he is a \"grunter.\" This is a sound emitted\r\nduring expiration when the animal is suddenly moved, or startled, or\r\nstruck at. If he grunts he is further tested for roaring. Grunters are\r\nnot always roarers, but, as it is a common thing for a roarer to grunt,\r\nsuch an animal must be looked upon with suspicion until he is thoroughly\r\ntried by pulling a load or galloped up a hill. The test should be a\r\nsevere one. Horses suffering with pleurisy, pleurodynia, or rheumatism,\r\nand other affections accompanied with much pain, will grunt when moved,\r\nor when the pain is aggravated, but grunting under these circumstances\r\ndoes not justify the term of \"grunter\" being applied to the horse, as\r\nthe grunting ceases when the animal recovers from the disease that\r\ncauses the pain.\r\n\r\n_High blowing._--This term is applied to a noisy breathing made by some\r\nhorses. It is distinctly a nasal sound, and must not be confounded with\r\n\"roaring.\" The sound is produced by the action of the nostrils. It is a\r\nhabit and not an unsoundness. Contrary to roaring, when the animal is\r\nput to severe exertion the sound ceases. An animal that emits this sound\r\nis called a \"high blower.\" Some horses have naturally very narrow nasal\r\nopenings, and they may emit sounds louder than usual in their breathing\r\nwhen exercised.\r\n\r\n_Whistling_ is only one of the variations of the sound emitted by a\r\nhorse called a \"roarer,\" and therefore needs no further notice, except\r\nto remind the reader that a whistling sound may be produced during an\r\nattack of severe sore throat or inflammation of the larynx, which passes\r\naway with the disease that causes it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONIC BRONCHITIS.\r\n\r\nThis may be due to the same causes as acute bronchitis or it may follow\r\nthe latter disease. An attack of the chronic form is liable to be\r\nconverted into acute bronchitis by a very slight cause. This chronic\r\naffection in most instances is associated with thickening of the walls\r\nof the tubes. Its course is slower, it is less severe, and is not\r\naccompanied with so much fever as the acute form. If the animal is\r\nexerted, the breathing becomes quickened and he soon shows signs of\r\nexhaustion. In many instances the animal keeps up strength and\r\nappearances moderately well, but in other cases the appetite is lost,\r\nflesh gradually disappears, and he becomes emaciated and debilitated. It\r\nis accompanied with a persistent cough, which in some cases is husky,\r\nsmothered, or muffled, while in others it is hard and clear. A whitish\r\nmatter, which may be curdled, is discharged from the nose. If the ear is\r\nplaced against the chest behind the shoulder blade, the rattle of the\r\nair passing through the mucus can be heard within.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Rest is necessary, as even under the most favorable\r\ncircumstances a cure is difficult to effect. The animal can not stand\r\nexertion and should not be compelled to undergo it. It should have much\r\nthe same general care and medical treatment prescribed for the acute\r\nform. Arsenious acid in tonic doses (3 to 7 grains) three times daily\r\nmay be given. As arsenic is irritant, it must be mixed with a\r\nconsiderable bulk of moist feed and never given alone. Arsenic may be\r\ngiven in the form of Fowler's solution, 1 ounce three times daily in the\r\ndrinking water. An application of mustard applied to the breast is a\r\nbeneficial adjunct. The diet should be the most nourishing. Bulky feed\r\nshould not be given. Linseed mashes, scalded oats, and, if in season,\r\ngrass and green-blade fodder are the best diet.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LUNGS.\r\n\r\nThe lungs (see Pl. VII) are the essential organs of respiration. They\r\nconsist of two (right and left) spongy masses, commonly called the\r\n\"lights,\" situated entirely within the thoracic cavity. On account of\r\nthe space taken up by the heart, the left lung is the smaller.\r\nExternally, they are completely covered by the pleura. The structure of\r\nthe lung consists of a light, soft, but very strong and remarkably\r\nelastic tissue, which can be torn only with difficulty. Each lung is\r\ndivided into a certain number of lobes, which are subdivided into\r\nnumberless lobules (little lobes). A little bronchial tube terminates in\r\nevery one of these lobules. The little tube then divides into minute\r\nbranches which open into the air cells (pulmonary vesicles) of the\r\nlungs. The air cells are little sacs having a diameter varying from\r\none-seventieth to one two-hundredth of an inch; they have but one\r\nopening, the communication with the branches of the little bronchial\r\ntubes. Small blood vessels ramify in the walls of the air cells. The air\r\ncells are the consummation of the intricate structures forming the\r\nrespiratory apparatus. They are of prime importance, all the rest being\r\ncomplementary. It is here that the exchange of gases takes place. As\r\nbefore stated, the walls of the cells are very thin; so, also, are the\r\nwalls of the blood vessels. Through these walls escapes from the blood\r\nthe carbonic acid gas that has been absorbed by the blood in its\r\ncirculation through the different parts of the body; through these walls\r\nalso the oxygen gas, which is the life-giving element of the atmosphere,\r\nis absorbed by the blood from the air in the air cells.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGESTION OF THE LUNGS.\r\n\r\nCongestion is essentially an excess of blood in the vessels of the parts\r\naffected. Congestion of the lungs in the horse, when it exists as an\r\nindependent affection, is generally caused by overexertion when the\r\nanimal is not in a fit condition to undergo more than moderate exercise.\r\nVery often what is recognized as congestion of the lungs is but a\r\nsymptom of exhaustion or dilatation of the heart.\r\n\r\nThe methods practiced by the trainers of running and trotting horses\r\nwill give an idea of what is termed \"putting a horse in condition\" to\r\nstand severe exertion. The animal at first gets walking exercises, then\r\nafter some time he is made to go faster and farther each day; the amount\r\nof work is daily increased until he is said to be \"in condition.\" An\r\nanimal so prepared runs no risk of being affected with congestion of\r\nthe lungs, if he is otherwise healthy. On the other hand, if the horse\r\nis kept in the stable for the purpose of laying on fat or for want of\r\nsomething to do, the muscular system becomes soft, and the horse is not\r\nin condition to stand the severe exertion of going fast or far, no\r\nmatter how healthy he may be in other respects. If such a horse be given\r\na hard ride or drive, he may start off in high spirits, but soon becomes\r\nexhausted, and if he is pushed he will slacken his pace, show a desire\r\nto stop, and may stagger or even fall. Examination will show the\r\nnostrils dilated, the flanks heaving, the countenance haggard, and the\r\nappearance of suffocation. The heart and muscles were not accustomed to\r\nthe sudden and severe strain put upon them; the heart became unable to\r\nperform its work; the blood accumulated in the vessels of the lungs,\r\nwhich eventually became engorged with the stagnated blood, constituting\r\ncongestion of the lungs.\r\n\r\nThe animal, after having undergone severe exertion, may not exhibit\r\nalarming symptoms until returned to the stable; then he will be noticed\r\nstanding with his head down, legs spread out, the eyes wildly staring or\r\ndull and sunken. The breathing is very rapid and almost gasping; in most\r\ncases the body is covered with perspiration, which, however, may soon\r\nevaporate, leaving the surface of the body and the legs and ears cold;\r\nthe breathing is both abdominal and thoracic; the chest rises and falls\r\nand the flanks are powerfully brought into action. If the pulse can be\r\nfelt at all it will be found beating very frequently, one hundred or so\r\nto a minute. The heart may be felt tumultuously thumping if the hand is\r\nplaced against the chest behind the left elbow, or it may be scarcely\r\nperceptible. The animal may tremble all over. If the ear is placed\r\nagainst the side of the chest a loud murmur will be heard and perhaps a\r\nfine, crackling sound.\r\n\r\nOne can scarcely fail to recognize a case of congestion of the lungs\r\nwhen brought on by overexertion, as the history of the case indicates\r\nthe nature of the ailment. In all cases of suffocation the lungs are\r\ncongested. It is also seen in connection with other diseases.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--If the animal is attacked by the disease while on the\r\nroad, stop him immediately. Do not attempt to return to the stables. If\r\nhe is in the stable, make arrangements at once to insure an unlimited\r\nsupply of pure air. If the weather is warm, out in the open air is the\r\nbest place, but if too cold let him stand with head to the door. Let him\r\nstand still; he has all he can do, if he obtains sufficient pure air to\r\nsustain life. If he is encumbered with harness or saddle, remove it at\r\nonce and rub the body with cloths or wisps of hay or straw. This\r\nstimulates the circulation in the skin, and thus aids in relieving the\r\nlungs of the extra quantity of blood that is stagnated there. If you\r\nhave three or four assistants, let them rub the body and legs well until\r\nthe skin feels natural; rub the legs until they are warm, if possible.\r\nWhen the circulation is reestablished, put bandages on the legs from the\r\nhoofs up as far as possible. Throw a blanket over the body and let the\r\nrubbing be done under the blanket. Diffusible stimulants are the\r\nmedicines indicated--brandy, whisky (or even ale or beer if nothing else\r\nis at hand), ether, and aromatic spirits of ammonia. A drench of 2\r\nounces each of spirits of nitrous ether and alcohol, diluted with a pint\r\nof water, every hour until relief is afforded, is among the best\r\nremedies. Or, give a quarter of a pint of whisky in a pint of water\r\nevery hour, or the same quantity of brandy as often, or a quart of ale\r\nevery hour, or 1 ounce of tincture of arnica in a pint of water every\r\nhour until five or six doses have been given. If none of these remedies\r\nare at hand, 2 ounces of oil of turpentine, shaken with a half pint of\r\nmilk, may be given once, but not repeated. The animal may be bled from\r\nthe jugular vein. Do not take more than 5 or 6 quarts from the vein, and\r\ndo not repeat the bleeding. The blood thus drawn will have a tarry\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VII.\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF THE LEFT LUNG.]\r\n\r\nWhen the alarming symptoms have subsided active measures may be stopped,\r\nbut care must be used in the general treatment of the animal for several\r\ndays, for it must be remembered that congestion may be followed by\r\npneumonia. The animal should have a comfortable stall, where he will not\r\nbe subjected to drafts or sudden changes of temperature; he should be\r\nblanketed and the legs kept bandaged. The air should be pure, a\r\nplentiful supply of fresh, cold water always in the stall; and a diet\r\ncomposed principally of bran mashes, scalded oats, and, if in season,\r\ngrass. When ready for use again the horse should at first receive only\r\nmoderate exercise, which may be daily increased until he may safely be\r\nput to regular work.\r\n\r\n\r\nPNEUMONIA, OR LUNG FEVER.\r\n\r\nPneumonia is inflammation of the lungs. The chief varieties of pneumonia\r\nare catarrhal--later discussed in connection with bronchitis, under the\r\nname of broncho-pneumonia--and the fibrinous or croupous variety. The\r\nlatter form receives its names from the fact that the air spaces are\r\nchoked with coagulated fibrin thrown out from the blood. This causes the\r\ndiseased portions of the lungs to become as firm as liver, in which\r\ncondition they are said to be hepatized. As air is excluded by the\r\ninflammatory product, the diseased lung will not float in water.\r\n\r\nThe inflammation usually begins in the lower part of the lung and\r\nextends upward. The first stage of the disease consists of congestion,\r\nor engorgement, of the blood vessels, followed by leakage of serum\r\ncontaining fibrin from the blood vessels into the air passages. The\r\nfluids thus escaping into the air cells and in the minute branches of\r\nthe little bronchial tubes become coagulated.\r\n\r\nThe pleura covering the affected parts may be more or less inflamed. A\r\ncontinuance of the foregoing phenomena is marked by a further escape of\r\nthe constituents of the blood, and a change in the membrane of the\r\ncells, which becomes swollen. The exudate that fills the air cells and\r\nminute bronchial branches undergoes disintegration and softening when\r\nhealing commences.\r\n\r\nThe favorable termination of pneumonia is in resolution that is, a\r\nrestoration to health. This is gradually brought about by the exuded\r\nmaterial contained in the air cells and lung tissues being broken down\r\nand softened and absorbed or expectorated through the nostrils. The\r\nblood vessels return to their natural state, and the blood circulates in\r\nthem as before. In the cases that do not terminate so happily the lung\r\nmay become gangrenous (or mortified), an abscess may form, or the\r\ndisease may be merged into the chronic variety.\r\n\r\nPneumonia may be directly induced by any of the influences named as\r\ngeneral causes for diseases of the organs of respiration, but in many\r\ninstances it is from neglect. A common cold or sore throat may be\r\nfollowed by pneumonia if neglected or improperly treated. An animal may\r\nbe debilitated by a cold, and when in this weakened state may be\r\ncompelled to undergo exertion beyond his strength; or he may be kept in\r\na badly ventilated stable, where the foul gases are shut in and the pure\r\nair is shut out; or the stable may be so open that parts of the body are\r\nexposed to drafts of cold air. An animal is predisposed to pneumonia\r\nwhen debilitated by any constitutional disease, and especially during\r\nconvalescence if exposed to any of the exciting causes. Foreign bodies,\r\nsuch as feed accidentally getting into the lungs by way of the windpipe,\r\nas well as the inhalation of irritating gases and smoke, ofttimes\r\nproduce fatal attacks of inflammation of the lung and bronchial tubes.\r\nPneumonia is frequently seen in connection with other diseases, such as\r\ninfluenza, purpura hemorrhagica, strangles, glanders, etc. Pneumonia and\r\npleurisy are most common during cold, damp weather, and especially\r\nduring the prevalence of the cold north or northeasterly winds. Wounds\r\npuncturing the thoracic cavity may cause pneumonia.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Pneumonia, when a primary disease, is ushered in by a\r\nchill, more or less prolonged, which in many cases is seen neither by\r\nthe owner nor the attendant, but is overlooked. The breathing becomes\r\naccelerated, and the animal hangs its head and has a very dull\r\nappearance. The mouth is hot and has a sticky feeling to the touch; the\r\nheat conveyed to the finger in the mouth demonstrates a fever; if the\r\nthermometer is placed in the rectum the temperature will be found to\r\nhave risen to 103 deg. F. or higher. The pulse is frequent, beating from\r\nfifty or sixty to eighty or more a minute. There is usually a dry cough\r\nfrom the beginning, which, however, changes in character as the disease\r\nadvances; for instance, it may become moist, or if pleurisy sets in, the\r\ncough will be peculiar to the latter affection; that is, cut short in\r\nthe endeavor to suppress it. In some cases the discharge from the\r\nnostrils is tinged with blood, while in other cases it has the\r\nappearance of muco-pus. The appetite is lost to a greater or less\r\nextent, but the desire for water is increased, particularly during the\r\nonset of the fever. The membrane within the nostrils is red and at first\r\ndry, but sooner or later becomes moist. The legs are cold. The bowels\r\nare more or less constipated, and what dung is passed is usually covered\r\nwith a slimy mucus. The urine is passed in smaller quantities than usual\r\nand is of a darker color.\r\n\r\nThe animal prefers to have the head where the freshest air can be\r\nobtained. When affected with pneumonia a horse does not lie down, but\r\npersists in standing from the beginning of the attack. If pneumonia is\r\ncomplicated with pleurisy, however, the horse may appear restless and\r\nlie down for a few moments to gain relief from the pleuritic pains, but\r\nhe soon rises. In pneumonia the breathing is rapid and difficult, but\r\nwhen the pneumonia is complicated with pleurisy the ribs are kept as\r\nstill as possible and the breathing is abdominal; that is, the abdominal\r\nmuscles are now made to do as much of the work as they can perform. If\r\npleurisy is not present there is little pain. To the ordinary observer\r\nthe animal may not appear dangerously ill, as he does not show the\r\nseriousness of the ailment by violence, as in colic, but a careful\r\nobserver will discover at a glance that the trouble is something more\r\nserious than a cold. By percussion it will be shown that some portions\r\nof the chest are less resonant than in health, indicating exclusion of\r\nair. If the air is wholly excluded the percussion is quite dull, like\r\nthat elicited by percussion over the thigh.\r\n\r\nBy auscultation important information may be gained. When the ear is\r\nplaced against the chest of a healthy horse, the respiratory murmur is\r\nheard more or less distinctly, according to the part of the chest that\r\nis beneath the ear. In the very first stage of pneumonia this murmur is\r\nlouder and hoarser; also, there is a fine, crackling sound something\r\nsimilar to that produced when salt is thrown in a fire. After the\r\naffected part becomes solid there is an absence of sound over that\r\nparticular part. After absorption begins one may again hear sounds that\r\nare of a more or less moist character and resemble bubbling or gurgling,\r\nwhich gradually change until the natural sound is heard announcing\r\nreturn to health.\r\n\r\nWhen a fatal termination is approaching all the symptoms become\r\nintensified. The breathing becomes still more rapid and difficult; the\r\nflanks heave; the animal stares wildly about as if seeking aid to drive\r\noff the feeling of suffocation; the body is bathed with sweat; the horse\r\nstaggers, but quickly recovers his balance; he may now, for the first\r\ntime during the attack, lie down; he does so, however, in the hope of\r\nrelief, which he fails to find, and with difficulty struggles to his\r\nfeet; he pants; the nostrils flap; he staggers and sways from side to\r\nside and backward and forward, but still tries to retain the standing\r\nposition, even by propping himself against the stall. It is no use, as\r\nafter an exhausting fight for breath he goes down; the limbs stretch out\r\nand become rigid. In fatal cases death usually occurs in from 10 to 20\r\ndays after the beginning of the attack. On the other hand, when the\r\ndisease is terminating favorably the signs are obvious. The fever abates\r\nand the animal gradually improves in appetite; he takes more notice of\r\nthings around him; his spirits improve; he has a general appearance of\r\nreturning health, and he lies down and rests. In the majority of cases\r\npneumonia, if properly treated, terminates in recovery.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The comfort and surroundings of the patient must be\r\nattended to first. The quarters should be the best that can be provided.\r\nPure air is essential. Avoid placing the animal in a stall where he may\r\nbe exposed to drafts of cold air and sudden changes of temperature. It\r\nis much better for the animal if the air is cold and pure than if it is\r\nwarm and foul. It is better to make the animal comfortable with warm\r\nclothing than to make the stable warm by shutting off the ventilation.\r\nFrom the start the animal should have an unlimited supply of fresh, cold\r\ndrinking water. Blanket the body. Rub the legs until they are warm and\r\nthen put bandages on them from the hoofs up to the knees and hocks. If\r\nwarmth can not be reestablished in the legs by hand rubbing alone, apply\r\ndry, ground mustard and rub well in. The bandages should be removed once\r\nor twice every day, the legs well rubbed, and the bandages replaced.\r\nMuch harm is often done by clipping off hair and rubbing in powerful\r\nblistering compounds. They do positive injury and retard recovery, and\r\nshould not be allowed. Much benefit may be derived from hot application\r\nto the sides of the chest if the facilities are at hand to apply them.\r\nIf the weather is not too cold, and if the animal is in a comfortable\r\nstable, the following method may be tried: Have a tub of hot water handy\r\nto the stable door; soak a woolen blanket in the water, then quickly\r\nwring as much water as possible out of it and wrap it around the chest.\r\nSee that it fits closely to the skin; do not allow it to sag so that air\r\nmay get between it and the skin. Now wrap a dry blanket over the wet hot\r\none and hold in place with three girths. The hot blanket should be\r\nrenewed every half hour, and while it is off being wetted and wrung the\r\ndry one should remain over the wet part of the chest to prevent\r\nreaction. The hot applications should be kept up for three or four\r\nhours, and when stopped the skin should be quickly rubbed as dry as\r\npossible, an application of alcohol rubbed over the wet part, and a dry\r\nblanket snugly fitted over the animal. If the hot applications appear to\r\nbenefit, they may be tried on three or four consecutive days. Unless\r\nevery facility and circumstance favors the application of heat in the\r\nforegoing manner, it should not be attempted. If the weather is very\r\ncold or any of the details are omitted, more harm than good may result.\r\nMustard may be applied by making a paste with a pound of freshly ground\r\nmustard mixed with warm water. This is to be spread evenly over the\r\nsides back of the shoulder blades and down to the median line below the\r\nchest. Care should be taken to avoid rubbing the mustard upon the thin\r\nskin immediately back of the elbow. The mustard-covered area should be\r\ncovered with a paper and this with a blanket passed up from below and\r\nfastened over the back. The blanket and paper should be removed in from\r\none to two hours. When pneumonia follows another disease, the system is\r\nalways more of less debilitated and requires the careful use of\r\nstimulants from the beginning. To weaken the animal still further by\r\nbleeding him is one of the most effectual methods of retarding recovery,\r\neven if it does not hasten a fatal termination.\r\n\r\nAnother and oftentimes fatal mistake made by the nonprofessional is the\r\nindiscriminate and reckless use of aconite. This drug is one of the most\r\nactive poisons, and should not be handled by anyone who does not\r\nthoroughly understand its action and uses. It is only less active than\r\nprussic acid in its poisonous effects. It is a common opinion, often\r\nexpressed by nonprofessionals, that aconite is a stimulant. Nothing\r\ncould be more erroneous; in fact, it is just the reverse. It is one of\r\nthe most powerful sedatives used in the practice of medicine. In fatal\r\ndoses it kills by paralyzing the very muscles used in breathing; it\r\nweakens the action of the heart, and should not be used. Do not give\r\npurgative medicines. If constipation exists, overcome it by an allowance\r\nof laxative diet, such as scalded oats, bran, and linseed mashes; also,\r\ngrass, if in season. If the costiveness is not relieved by the laxative\r\ndiet, give an enema of about a quart of warm water three or four times a\r\nday.\r\n\r\nA diet consisting principally of bran mashes, scalded oats, and, when in\r\nseason, grass or corn fodder is preferable if the animal retains an\r\nappetite; but if no desire is evinced for feed of this particular\r\ndescription, then the animal must be allowed to eat anything that will\r\nbe taken spontaneously. Hay tea, made by pouring boiling water over good\r\nhay in a large bucket and allowing it to stand until cool, then\r\nstraining off the liquid, will sometimes create a desire for feed. The\r\nanimal may be allowed to drink as much of it as he desires. Corn on the\r\ncob is often eaten when everything else is refused. Bread may be tried;\r\nalso apples or carrots. If the animal can be persuaded to drink milk,\r\nit may be supported by it for days. Three or four gallons of sweet milk\r\nmay be given during the day, in which may be stirred three or four fresh\r\neggs to each gallon. Some horses will drink milk, while others will\r\nrefuse to touch it. It should be borne in mind that all feed must be\r\ntaken by the horse as he desires it; none should be forced down him. If\r\nhe will not eat, you will only have to wait until a desire is shown for\r\nfeed. All kinds may be offered, first one thing and then another, but\r\nfeed should not be allowed to remain long in trough or manger; the very\r\nfact of its constantly being before him will cause him to loathe it.\r\nWhen the animal has no appetite for anything the stomach is not in a\r\nproper state to digest food, and if it is poured or drenched into him it\r\nwill only cause indigestion and aggravate the case. It is a good\r\npractice to do nothing when there is nothing to be done that will\r\nbenefit. This refers to medicine as well as feed. Nothing is well done\r\nthat is overdone.\r\n\r\nThere are many valuable medicines used for the different stages and\r\ndifferent types of pneumonia, but in the opinion of the writer it is\r\nuseless to refer to them here, as this work is intended for the use of\r\nthose who are not sufficiently acquainted with the disease to recognize\r\nits various types and stages; therefore they would only confuse. If you\r\ncan administer a ball or capsule, or have anyone at hand who is capable\r\nof doing it, a dram of sulphate of quinin in a capsule, or made into a\r\nball, with sufficient linseed meal and molasses, given every three hours\r\nduring the height of the fever, will do good in many cases. The ball of\r\ncarbonate of ammonia, as advised in the treatment of bronchitis, may be\r\ntried if the animal is hard to drench. The heart should be kept strong\r\nby administering digitalis in doses of 2 drams of the tincture every\r\nthree hours, or strychnia 1 grain, made into a pill with licorice\r\npowder, three times daily.\r\n\r\nIf the horse becomes very much debilitated, stimulants of a more\r\npronounced character are required. The following drench is useful:\r\nRectified spirits, 3 ounces; spirits of nitrous ether, 2 ounces; water,\r\n1 pint. This may be repeated every four or five hours if it seems to\r\nbenefit; or 6 ounces of good whisky diluted with a pint of water may be\r\ngiven as often, instead of the foregoing.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of convalescence good nutritive feed should be allowed\r\nin a moderate quantity. Tonic medicines should be substituted for those\r\nused during the fever. The same medicines advised for the convalescing\r\nperiod of bronchitis are equally efficient in this case, especially the\r\niodid of potash; likewise, the same general instructions apply here.\r\n\r\nThe chief causes of death in pneumonia are heart failure from\r\nexhaustion, suffocation, or blood poisoning from death (gangrene) of\r\nlung tissue. The greater the area of lung tissue diseased the greater\r\nthe danger; hence double pneumonia is more fatal than pneumonia of one\r\nlung.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WINDPIPE.\r\n\r\nThe windpipe, or trachea as it is technically called, is the flexible\r\ntube that extends from, the larynx, which it succeeds at the throat, to\r\nabove the base of the heart in the chest, where it terminates by\r\ndividing into the right and left bronchi--the tubes going to the right\r\nand left lung, respectively. The windpipe is composed of about fifty\r\nincomplete rings of cartilage united by ligaments. A muscular layer is\r\nsituated on the superior surface of the rings. Internally the tube is\r\nlined with a continuation of the mucous membrane that lines the entire\r\nrespiratory tract, which here has very little sensibility in contrast to\r\nthat lining the larynx, which is endowed with exquisite sensitiveness.\r\n\r\nThe windpipe is not subject to any special disease, but is more or less\r\naffected during laryngitis (sore throat), influenza, bronchitis, etc.,\r\nand requires no special treatment. The membrane may be left in a\r\nthickened condition after these attacks. One or more of the rings may be\r\naccidentally fractured, or the tube may be distorted or malformed as the\r\nresult of violent injury. After the operation of tracheotomy it is not\r\nuncommon to find a tumor or malformation as a result, or sequel, of the\r\noperation. In passing over this section attention is merely called to\r\nthese defects, as they require no particular attention in the way of\r\ntreatment. It may be stated, however, that any one of the\r\nbefore-mentioned conditions may constitute one of the causes of noisy\r\nrespiration described as \"thick wind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGUTTURAL POUCHES.\r\n\r\nThese two sacs are situated above the throat, and communicate with the\r\npharynx, as well as with the cavity of the tympanum of the ear. They are\r\npeculiar to solipeds. Normally, they contain air. Their function is\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nOne or both guttural pouches may contain pus. The symptoms are as\r\nfollows: Swelling on the side below the ear and an intermittent\r\ndischarge of matter from one or both nostrils, especially when the head\r\nis depressed.\r\n\r\nThe swelling is soft, and, if pressed upon, matter will escape from the\r\nnose if the head is depressed. As before mentioned, these pouches\r\ncommunicate with the pharynx, and through this small opening matter may\r\nescape. A recovery is probable if the animal is turned out to graze, or\r\nif he is fed from the ground, as the dependent position of the head\r\nfavors the escape of matter from the pouches. In addition to this, give\r\nthe tonics recommended for nasal gleet. If this treatment fails, an\r\noperation must be performed, which should not be attempted by any one\r\nunacquainted with the anatomy of the part.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRONCHITIS AND BRONCHO-PNEUMONIA.\r\n\r\nBronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes. When this\r\ninflammation extends to the air sacs at the termini of the smallest\r\nbranches of the bronchial tubes, the disease is broncho-pneumonia.\r\nBronchitis affecting the larger tubes is less serious than when the\r\nsmaller are involved. The disease may be either acute or chronic. The\r\ncauses are generally much the same as for other diseases of the\r\nrespiratory organs, noticed in the beginning of this article. The\r\nspecial causes are these: The inhalation of irritating gases and smoke\r\nand fluids or solids gaining access to the parts. Bronchitis is\r\noccasionally associated with influenza and other specific fevers. It\r\nalso supervenes on common cold or sore throat.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The animal appears dull; the appetite is partially or\r\nwholly lost; the head hangs; the breathing is quickened; the cough, at\r\nfirst dry, and having somewhat the character of a \"barking cough,\" is\r\nsucceeded in a few days by a moist, rattling cough; the mouth is hot;\r\nthe visible membranes in the nose are red; the pulse is frequent, and\r\nduring the first stage is hard and quick, but as the disease advances\r\nbecomes smaller and more frequent. There is a discharge from the\r\nnostrils that is at first whitish, but later becomes creamy or frothy,\r\nstill later it is sometimes tinged with blood, and occasionally it may\r\nbe of a brownish or rusty color. By auscultation, or placing the ear to\r\nthe sides of the chest, unnatural sounds can now be heard. The air\r\npassing through the diseased tubes causes a wheezing sound when the\r\nsmall tubes are affected, and a hoarse, cooing, or snoring sound when\r\nthe larger tubes are involved. After one or two days the dry stage of\r\nthe disease is succeeded by a moist state of the membrane. The ear now\r\ndetects a different sounds caused by the bursting of the bubbles as the\r\nair passes through the fluid, which is the exudate of inflammation and\r\nthe augmented mucous secretions of the membrane. The mucus may be\r\nsecreted in great abundance, which, by blocking up the tubes, may cause\r\na collapse of a large extent of breathing surface. Usually the mucus is\r\nexpectorated; that is, discharged through the nose. The matter is\r\ncoughed up, and when it reaches the larynx much of it may be swallowed,\r\nand some is discharged from the nostrils. The horse can not spit, like\r\nthe human being, nor does the matter coughed up gain access to the\r\nmouth. If in serious cases all the symptoms become aggravated, the\r\nbreathing is labored, short, and quick, it usually indicates that the\r\ninflammation has reached the breathing cells and that catarrhal\r\npneumonia is established. In this case the ribs rise and fall much more\r\nthan natural. This fact alone is enough to exclude the idea that the\r\nanimal may be affected with pleurisy, because in that disease the ribs\r\nare as nearly fixed as it is in the power of the animal to do so, and\r\nthe breathing is accomplished to a great extent by aid of the abdominal\r\nmuscles. The horse persists in standing throughout the attack. He\r\nprefers to stand with head to a door or window to gain all the fresh air\r\npossible, but if not tied may occasionally wander listlessly about the\r\nstall. The bowels most likely are constipated; the dung is covered with\r\nslimy mucus. The urine is decreased in quantity and darker in color than\r\nusual. The animal shows more or less thirst; in some cases the mouth is\r\nfull of saliva. The discharge from the nose increases in quantity as the\r\ndisease advances and inflammation subsides. This is rather a good\r\nsymptom, as it shows that one stage has passed. The discharge then\r\ngradually decreases, the cough becomes less rasping, but of more\r\nfrequent occurrence, until it gradually disappears with the return of\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nBronchitis, affecting the smaller tubes, is one of the most fatal\r\ndiseases, while that of the larger tubes is never very serious. It must\r\nbe stated, however, that it is an exceedingly difficult matter for a\r\nnonexpert to discriminate between the two forms, and, further, it may as\r\nwell be said here that he will have difficulty in discriminating between\r\nbronchitis and pneumonia.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The matter of first importance is to insure pure air to\r\nbreathe, and next to make the patient's quarters as comfortable as\r\npossible. A well-ventilated box stall serves best for all purposes.\r\nCover the body with a blanket, light or heavy, as the season of the year\r\ndemands. Hand-rub the legs until they are warm, then wrap them in cotton\r\nand apply flannel or Derby bandages from the hoofs to the knees and\r\nhocks. If the legs can not be made warm with hand rubbing alone, apply\r\ndry mustard. Rub in thoroughly and then put the bandages on; also rub\r\nmustard paste well over the side of the chest, covering the space\r\nbeginning immediately behind the shoulder blade and running back about\r\neighteen inches, and from the median line beneath the breast to within\r\nten inches of the ridge of the backbone. Repeat the application to the\r\nside of the chest about three days after the first one is applied.\r\n\r\nCompel the animal to inhale steam from a bucketful of boiling water\r\ncontaining a tablespoonful of oil of turpentine and spirits of camphor,\r\nas advised for cold in the head. In serious cases the steam should be\r\ninhaled every hour, and in any case the oftener it is done the greater\r\nwill be the beneficial results. Three times a day administer an\r\nelectuary containing acetate of potash (2 drams), with licorice and\r\nmolasses or honey. It is well to keep a bucketful of cold water before\r\nthe animal all the time. If the horse is prostrated and has no appetite,\r\ngive the following drench: Spirits of nitrous ether, 2 ounces;\r\nrectified spirits, 3 ounces; water, 1 pint. Repeat the dose every four\r\nor five hours if it appears to benefit. When the horse is hard to\r\ndrench, give the following: Pulverized carbonate of ammonia, 3 drams;\r\nlinseed meal and molasses sufficient to make the whole into a stiff\r\nmass; wrap it with a small piece of tissue paper and give as a ball.\r\nThis ball may be repeated every four or five hours. When giving the ball\r\ncare should be taken to prevent its breaking in the mouth, as in case of\r\nsuch accident it will make the mouth sore and prevent the animal from\r\neating. If the bowels are constipated, give enemas of warm water. Do not\r\ngive purgative medicines. Do not bleed the animal.\r\n\r\nIf the animal retains an appetite, a soft diet is preferable, such as\r\nscalded oats, bran mashes, and grass, if in season. If he refuses cooked\r\nfeed, allow in small quantities anything he will eat. Hay, cob corn,\r\noats, bread, apples, and carrots may be tried in turn. Some horses will\r\ndrink sweet milk when they refuse all other kinds of feed, and\r\nespecially is this the case if the drinking water is withheld for a\r\nwhile. One or 2 gallons at a time, four or five times a day, will\r\nsupport life. Bear in mind that when the disease is established recovery\r\ncan not occur in less than two or three weeks, and more time may be\r\nnecessary. Good nursing and patience are required.\r\n\r\nWhen the symptoms have abated and nothing remains of the disease except\r\nthe cough and a white discharge from the nostrils, all other medicines\r\nshould be discontinued and a course of tonic treatment pursued. Give the\r\nfollowing mixture: Reduced iron, 3 ounces; powdered gentian, 8 ounces;\r\nmix well together and divide into sixteen powders. Give a powder every\r\nnight and morning mixed with bran and oats, if the animal will eat it,\r\nor shaken with about a pint of flaxseed tea and administered as a\r\ndrench.\r\n\r\nIf the cough remains after the horse is apparently well, give 1 dram of\r\niodid of potassium dissolved in a bucketful of drinking water one hour\r\nbefore each meal for two or three weeks if necessary. Do not put the\r\nanimal to work too soon after recovery. Allow ample time to regain\r\nstrength. This disease is prone to become chronic and may run into an\r\nincurable case of thick wind.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEURISY.\r\n\r\nThe thoracic cavity is divided into two lateral compartments, each\r\ncontaining one lung and a part of the heart. Each lung has its separate\r\npleural membrane, or covering. The pleura is the thin, glistening\r\nmembrane that covers the lung and also completely covers the internal\r\nwalls of the chest. It is very thin, and to the ordinary observer\r\nappears to be part of the lung, which, in fact, it is for all practical\r\npurposes. The smooth, shiny surface of the lung, as well as the smooth,\r\nshiny surface so familiar on the rib, is the pleura. In health this\r\nsurface is always moist. A fluid is thrown off by the pleura, which\r\ncauses the surface to be constantly moist. This is to prevent the\r\neffects of friction between the lungs and the walls of the chest and\r\nother contiguous parts which come in contact. It must be remembered that\r\nthe lungs are dilating each time a breath is taken in, and contracting\r\neach time a breath of air is expelled. It may be readily seen that if it\r\nwere not for the moistened state of the surface of the pleura the\r\ncontinual dilatation and contraction and the consequent rubbing of the\r\nparts against each other would cause serious friction.\r\n\r\nInflammation of this membrane is called pleurisy. Being so closely\r\nunited with the lung, it can not always escape participation in the\r\ndisease when the latter is inflamed. Pleurisy may be due to the same\r\npredisposing and exciting causes as mentioned in the beginning of this\r\nwork as general causes for diseases of the organs of respiration, such\r\nas exposure to sudden changes of temperature, confinement in damp\r\nstables, etc. It may be caused also by wounds that penetrate the chest,\r\nfor it must be remembered that such wounds must necessarily pierce the\r\npleura. A fractured rib may involve the pleura. The inflammation\r\nfollowing such wounds may be circumscribed; that is, confined to a small\r\narea surrounding the wound, or it may spread from the wound and involve\r\na large portion of the pleura. The pleura may be involved secondarily\r\nwhen the heart or its membrane is the primary seat of the disease. It\r\nmay occur in conjunction with bronchitis, influenza, and other diseases.\r\nDiseased growths that interfere with the pleura may induce pleurisy. The\r\nmost frequent cause of pleurisy is an extension of inflammation from\r\nadjacent diseased lung. It is a common complication of pneumonia.\r\nPleurisy will be described here as an independent affection, although it\r\nshould be remembered that it is very often associated with the foregoing\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nThe first lesion of pleurisy is overfilling of the blood vessels that\r\nramify in this membrane and dryness of the surface. This is followed by\r\nthe formation of a coating of coagulated fibrin on the diseased pleura\r\nand the transudation of serum which collects in the chest. This serum\r\nmay contain flakes of fibrin and it may be straw colored or red from an\r\nadmixture of blood. The quantity of this accumulation may amount to\r\nseveral gallons.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--When the disease exists as an independent affection it is\r\nushered in by a chill, but this is usually overlooked. About the first\r\nthing noticed is the disinclination of the animal to move or turn\r\naround. When made to do so he grunts or groans with pain. He stands\r\nstiff; the ribs are fixed--that is, they move very little in the act of\r\nbreathing--but the abdomen works more than natural; both the fore feet\r\nand elbows may be turned out; during the onset of the attack the animal\r\nmay be restless and act as if he had a slight colic; he may even lie\r\ndown, but does not remain long down, for when he finds no relief he soon\r\ngets up. After effusion begins these signs of restlessness disappear.\r\nEvery movement of the chest causes pain; therefore the cough is\r\npeculiar; it is short and suppressed and comes as near being no cough as\r\nthe animal can make it in his desire to suppress it. The breathing is\r\nhurried, the mouth is hot, the temperature being elevated from 102 deg. or\r\n103 deg. to 105 deg. F. Symptoms that usually accompany fever are present, such\r\nas costiveness, scanty, dark-colored urine, etc. The pulse is frequent,\r\nperhaps 70 or more a minute, and is hard and wiry. The legs and ears are\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nPercussion is of valuable service in this affection. After effusion\r\noccurs the sound produced by percussing over the lower part of the chest\r\nis dull. By striking different parts one may come to a spot of greater\r\nor less extent where the blows cause much pain to be evinced. The animal\r\nmay grunt or groan every time it is struck. Another method of detecting\r\nthe affected part is to press the fingers between the ribs, each space\r\nin succession, beginning behind the elbow, until a place where the\r\npressure causes more flinching than at any other part is reached.\r\nAuscultation is also useful. In the first stage, when the surfaces are\r\ndry and rough, one may hear, immediately under the ear, a distinct sound\r\nvery much like that produced by rubbing two pieces of coarse paper\r\ntogether. No such friction sound occurs when the membrane is healthy, as\r\nthe natural moisture, heretofore mentioned, prevents the friction. In\r\nmany cases this friction is so pronounced that it may be felt by placing\r\nthe hand over the affected part. When the dry stage is succeeded by the\r\nexudation of fluid this friction sound disappears. After the effusion\r\ninto the cavity takes place sometimes there is heard a tinkling or\r\nmetallic sound, due to dropping of the exudate from above into the\r\ncollected fluid in the bottom of the cavity, as the collected fluid more\r\nof less separates the lung from the chest walls.\r\n\r\nWithin two or three days the urgent symptoms may abate owing to the\r\nexudation of the fluid, and the subsidence of the pain. The fluid may\r\nnow undergo absorption, and the case may terminate favorably within a\r\nweek or 10 days.\r\n\r\nIf the quantity of the effusion is large its own volume retards the\r\nprocess of absorption to a great extent, and consequently convalescence\r\nis delayed. In severe cases the pulse becomes more frequent, the\r\nbreathing more hurried and labored, the flanks work like bellows, the\r\nnostrils flap, the eyes stare wildly, the countenance expresses much\r\nanxiety, and general signs of dissolution are plain. After a time\r\nswellings appear under the chest and abdomen and down the legs. The\r\naccumulation in the chest is called hydrothorax, or dropsy of the chest.\r\nWhen this fluid contains pus the case usually proves fatal. The\r\ncondition of pus within the cavity is called empyema.\r\n\r\nPleurisy may affect only a small area of one side or it may affect both\r\nsides. It is oftener confined to the right side.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The instructions in regard to the general management of\r\nbronchitis and pneumonia must be adhered to in the treatment of\r\npleurisy. Comfortable quarters, pure air, warm clothing to the body and\r\nbandages to the legs, a plentiful supply of pure cold water, the\r\nlaxative feed, etc., in this case are equally necessary and efficacious.\r\nThe hot applications applied to the chest, as directed in the treatment\r\nof pneumonia, are very beneficial in pleurisy, and should be kept up\r\nwhile the symptoms show the animal to be in pain.\r\n\r\nDuring the first few days, when pain is manifested by restlessness,\r\napply hot packs to the sides diligently. After four or five days, when\r\nthe symptoms show that the acute stage has somewhat subsided, mustard\r\nmay be applied as recommended for pneumonia. From the beginning the\r\nfollowing drench may be given every six hours, if the horse takes it\r\nkindly: Solution of the acetate of ammonia, 3 ounces; spirits of nitrous\r\nether, 1 ounce; bicarbonate of potassium, 3 drams; water, 1 pint.\r\n\r\nIf the patient becomes debilitated, the stimulants as prescribed for\r\npneumonia should be used according to the same directions. The same\r\nattention should be given to the diet. If the animal will partake of the\r\nbran mashes, scalded oats, and grass, it is the best; but if he refuses\r\nthe laxative diet, then he should be tried with different kinds of feed\r\nand allowed whichever kind he desires.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the attack, if the pain is severe, causing the\r\nanimal to lie down or paw, morphin may be given by the mouth in 5-grain\r\ndoses, or the fluid extract of _Cannabis indica_ may be used in doses of\r\n2 to 4 drams.\r\n\r\nIf the case is not progressing favorable in ten or twelve days after the\r\nbeginning of the attack, convalescence is delayed by the fluid in the\r\nchest failing to be absorbed. The animal becomes dull and weak and\r\nevinces little or no desire for feed. The breathing becomes still more\r\nrapid and difficult. An effort must now be made to excite the absorption\r\nof the effusion. An application of liniment or mild blister should be\r\nrubbed over the lower part of both sides and the bottom of the chest.\r\nThe following drench may be given three times a day, for seven or eight\r\ndays, if it is necessary and appears to benefit: Tincture of the\r\nperchlorid of iron, 1 ounce; tincture of gentian, 2 ounces; water, 1\r\npint. Also give 1 dram of iodid of potassium, dissolved in the drinking\r\nwater, an hour before feeding every night and morning for a week or\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\n_Hydrothorax_ is sometimes difficult to overcome by means of the use of\r\nmedicines alone, when the operation of tapping the chest is performed to\r\nallow an escape for the accumulated fluid. The operation is performed\r\nwith a combined instrument called the trocar and cannula. The puncture\r\nis made in the lower part of the chest, in the space between the eighth\r\nand ninth ribs. Wounding of the intercostal artery is avoided by\r\ninserting the instrument as near as possible to the anterior edge of the\r\nrib. If the operation is of benefit, it is only so when performed before\r\nthe strength is lowered beyond recovery. The operation merely receives a\r\npassing notice here, as it is not presumed that the nonprofessional will\r\nattempt it, although in the hands of the expert it is attended with\r\nlittle danger or difficulty.\r\n\r\nWe have described here bronchitis, pneumonia, and pleurisy mainly as\r\nthey occur as independent diseases, but it should be remembered that\r\nthey merge into each other and may occur together at one time. While it\r\nis true that much more might have been said in regard to the different\r\nstages and types of the affections, and also in regard to the treatment\r\nof each stage and each particular type, the plan adopted of advising\r\nplain, conservative treatment is considered the wisest on account of\r\nsimplifying as much as possible a subject of which the reader is\r\nsupposed to know very little.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEUROPNEUMONIA.\r\n\r\nThis is the state in which an animal is affected with pleurisy and\r\npneumonia combined, which is not infrequently the case. At the beginning\r\nof the attack only one of the affections may be present, but the other\r\nsoon follows. It has already been stated that the pleura is closely\r\nadherent to the lung. The pleura on this account is frequently more or\r\nless affected by the spreading of the inflammation from the lung tissue.\r\nThere is a combination of the symptoms of both diseases, but to the\r\nordinary observer the symptoms of pleurisy are the most obvious. The\r\ncourse of treatment to be pursued differs in no manner from that given\r\nfor the affections when they occur independently. The symptoms will be\r\nthe guide as to the advisability of giving oil and laudanum for the pain\r\nif the pleurisy is very severe. It should not be resorted to unless it\r\nis necessary to allay the pain.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRONCHO-PLEUROPNEUMONIA.\r\n\r\nThis is the term or terms applied when bronchitis, pleurisy, and\r\npneumonia all exist at once. It is impossible for one who is not an\r\nexpert to diagnose the state with certainty. The apparent symptoms are\r\nthe same as when the animal is affected with pleuropneumonia.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPURATION AND ABSCESS IN THE LUNG.\r\n\r\nThere are instances, and especially when the surroundings of the patient\r\nhave been bad or the disease is of an especially severe type, when\r\npneumonia terminates in an abscess in the lung. Sometimes, when the\r\ninflammation has been extreme, suppuration in a large portion of the\r\nlung takes place. Impure air, the result of improper ventilation, is\r\namong the most frequent causes of this termination. The symptoms of\r\nsuppuration in the lung are chronic pneumonia, a solidified area of lung\r\ntissue, continued low fever, and, in some cases, offensive smell of the\r\nbreath, and the discharge of the matter from the nostrils.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORTIFICATION.\r\n\r\nGangrene, or mortification, means the death of the part affected.\r\nOccasionally, owing to the intensity of the inflammation or bad\r\ntreatment, pneumonia and pleuropneumonia terminate in mortification,\r\nwhich is soon followed by the death of the animal. Perhaps the most\r\ncommon cause of this complication is the presence of a foreign body in\r\nthe lung, as food particles or medicine. Rough drenching or drenching\r\nthrough the nostrils may cause this serious condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEMOPTYSIS, OR BLEEDING FROM THE LUNGS.\r\n\r\nBleeding from the lungs may occur during the course of congestion of the\r\nlungs, bronchitis, pneumonia, influenza, purpura hemorrhagica, or\r\nglanders. An accident or exertion may cause a rupture of a vessel.\r\nPlethora and hypertrophy of the heart predispose to it. Following the\r\nrupture of a vessel the blood may escape into the lung tissue and cause\r\na serious attack of pneumonia, or it may fill up the bronchial tubes and\r\nprove fatal by suffocating the animal. When the hemorrhage is from the\r\nlung it is accompanied with coughing; the blood is frothy, of a bright\r\nred color, and comes from both nostrils; whereas when the bleeding is\r\nmerely from a rupture of a vessel in some part of the head (heretofore\r\ndescribed as bleeding from the nose) the blood is most likely to issue\r\nfrom one nostril only, and the discharge is not accompanied with\r\ncoughing. The ear may be placed against the windpipe along its course,\r\nand if the blood is from the lungs a gurgling or rattling sound will be\r\nheard. When it occurs in connection with another disease it seldom\r\nrequires special treatment. When caused by accident or overexertion the\r\nanimal should be kept quiet. If the hemorrhage is profuse and continues\r\nfor several hours, 1 dram of the acetate of lead dissolved in a pint of\r\nwater may be given as a drench, or 1 ounce of the tincture of the\r\nperchlorid of iron, diluted with a pint of water, may be given instead\r\nof the lead. It is rare that the hemorrhage is so profuse as to require\r\ninternal remedies. But hemorrhage into the lung may occur and cause\r\ndeath by suffocation without the least manifestation of it by the\r\ndischarge of blood from the nose.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUBERCULOSIS OF THE LUNGS.\r\n\r\nPulmonary consumption or tuberculosis has been recognized in the horse\r\nin a number of instances. The symptoms are as of chronic pneumonia or\r\npleurisy. There is no treatment for the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAVES, BROKEN WIND, OR ASTHMA.\r\n\r\nMuch confusion exists in the popular mind in regard to the nature of\r\nheaves. Many horsemen loosely apply the term to all ailments where the\r\nbreathing is difficult or noisy. Scientific veterinarians are well\r\nacquainted with the phenomena and locality of the affection, but there\r\nis a great diversity of opinion as regards the exact cause. Asthma is\r\ngenerally thought to be caused by spasm of the small circular muscles\r\nthat surround the bronchial tubes. The continued existence of this\r\naffection of the muscles leads to a paralysis of them, and the forced\r\nbreathing to emphysema, which always accompanies heaves.\r\n\r\nHeaves is usually associated with disorder of the function of digestion\r\nor to an error in the choice of feed. Feeding on clover hay or damaged\r\nhay or straw, too bulky and innutritious feed, and keeping the horse in\r\na dusty atmosphere or a badly ventilated stable produce or predispose to\r\nheaves. Horses brought from a high to a low level are predisposed.\r\n\r\nIn itself broken wind is not a fatal disease, but death is generally\r\ncaused by an affection closely connected with it. After death, if the\r\norgans are examined, the lesions found depend much upon the length of\r\ntime broken wind has affected the animal. In recent cases very few\r\nchanges are noticeable, but in animals that have been broken-winded for\r\na long time the changes are well-marked. The lungs are paler than\r\nnatural, and of much less weight in proportion to the volume, as\r\nevidenced by floating them in water. The walls of the small bronchial\r\ntubes and the membrane of the larger tubes are thickened. The right side\r\nof the heart is enlarged and its cavities dilated. The stomach is\r\nenlarged and its walls stretched. The important change found in the\r\nlungs is a condition technically called pulmonary emphysema. This is of\r\ntwo varieties: First, what is termed \"vesicular emphysema,\" which\r\nconsists of an enlargement of the capacity of the air cells (air\r\nvesicles) by dilation of their walls. The second form is called\r\ninterlobular, or interstitial, emphysema, and follows the first. In\r\nthis variety the air finds its way into the lung tissue between the air\r\ncells or the tissue between the small lobules.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Almost every experienced horseman is able to detect heaves.\r\nThe peculiar movement of the flanks and abdomen point out the ailment at\r\nonce. In recent cases, however, the affected animal does not always\r\nexhibit the characteristic breathing unless exerted to a certain extent.\r\nThe cough which accompanies this disease is peculiar to it. It is\r\ndifficult to describe, but the sound is short and something like a\r\ngrunt. When air is inspired--that is, taken in--it appears to be done in\r\nthe same manner as in health; it may possibly be done a little quicker\r\nthan natural, but not enough to attract any notice. It is when the act\r\nof expiration (or expelling the air from the lungs) is performed that\r\nthe great change in the breathing is perceptible. It must be remembered\r\nthat the lungs have lost much of their elasticity, and in consequence of\r\ntheir power of contracting on account of the degeneration of the walls\r\nof the air cells, and also on account of the paralysis of muscular\r\ntissue before mentioned. The air passes into them freely, but the power\r\nto expel it is lost to a great extent by the lungs; therefore the\r\nabdominal muscles are brought into play. These muscles, especially in\r\nthe region of the flank, are seen to contract, then pause for a moment,\r\nthen complete the act of contracting, thus making a double bellowslike\r\nmovement at each expiration, a sort of jerky motion with every breath.\r\nThe double expiratory movement may also be detected by allowing the that\r\nthe expiratory current is not continuous, but is broken into two jets.\r\nWhen the animal is exerted a wheezing noise accompanies the breathing.\r\nThis noise may be heard to a less extent when the animal is at rest if\r\nthe ear is applied to the chest.\r\n\r\nAs before remarked, indigestion is often present in these cases. The\r\nanimal may have a depraved appetite, as shown by a desire to eat dirt\r\nand soiled bedding, which he often devours in preference to the clean\r\nfeed in the trough or manger. The stomach is liable to be overloaded\r\nwith indigestible feed. The abdomen may assume that form called\r\n\"potbellied.\" The animal frequently passes wind of a very offensive\r\nodor. When first put to work dung is passed frequently; the bowels are\r\noften loose. The animal can not stand much work, as the muscular system\r\nis soft. Round-chested horses are said to be predisposed to the disease,\r\nand it is certain that in cases of long standing the chest usually\r\nbecomes rounder than natural.\r\n\r\nCertain individuals become very expert in managing a horse affected with\r\nheaves in suppressing the symptoms for a short time. They take advantage\r\nof the fact that the breathing is much easier when the stomach and\r\nintestines are empty. They also resort to the use of medicines that\r\nhave a depressing effect. When the veterinarian is examining a horse for\r\nsoundness, and he suspects that the animal has been \"fixed,\" he usually\r\ngives the horse as much water as he will drink and then has him ridden\r\nor driven rapidly up a hill or on a heavy road. This will bring out the\r\ncharacteristic breathing of heaves if the horse is so afflicted, but\r\nwill not cause the symptoms of heaves in a healthy horse. All\r\nbroken-winded horses have the cough peculiar to the affection, but it is\r\nnot regular. A considerable time may elapse before it is heard and then\r\nit may come on in paroxysms, especially when first brought out of the\r\nstable into the cold air, or when excited by work, or after a drink of\r\ncold water. The cough is usually the first symptom of the disease.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--When the disease is established there is no cure for it.\r\nProper attention paid to the diet will relieve the distressing symptoms\r\nto a certain extent, but they will undoubtedly reappear in their\r\nintensity the first time the animal overloads the stomach or is allowed\r\nfood of bad quality. Clover hay or bulky feed which contains but little\r\nnutriment have much to do with the cause of the disease, and therefore\r\nshould be entirely omitted when the animal is affected, as well as\r\nbefore. It has been asserted that the disease is unknown where clover\r\nhay is never used. The diet should be confined to feed of the best\r\nquality and in the smallest quantity. The bad effect of moldy or dusty\r\nhay, fodder, or feed of any kind can not be overestimated. A small\r\nquantity of the best hay once a day is sufficient. This should be cut\r\nand dampened. The animal should invariably be watered before feeding;\r\nnever directly after a meal. The animal should not be worked immediately\r\nafter a meal. Exertion, when the stomach is full, invariably aggravates\r\nthe symptoms. Turning on pasture gives relief. Carrots, potatoes, or\r\nturnips chopped and mixed with oats or corn are a good diet. Half a pint\r\nto a pint of thick, dark molasses with each feed is useful.\r\n\r\nArsenic is efficacious in palliating the symptoms. It is best\r\nadministered in the form of a solution of arsenic, as Fowler's solution\r\nor as the white powdered arsenious acid. Of the former the dose is 1\r\nounce to the drinking water three times daily; of the latter one may\r\ngive 3 grains in each feed. These quantities may be cautiously increased\r\nas the animal becomes accustomed to the drug. If the bowels do not act\r\nregularly, a pint of raw linseed oil may be given once or twice a month,\r\nor a handful of Glauber's salt may be given in the feed twice daily, so\r\nlong as necessary. It must, however, be borne in mind that all medicinal\r\ntreatment is of secondary consideration; careful attention paid to the\r\ndiet is of greatest importance. Broken-winded animals should not be used\r\nfor breeding purposes. A predisposition to the disease may be\r\ninherited.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONIC COUGH.\r\n\r\nA chronic cough may succeed the acute disease of the respiratory organs,\r\nsuch as pneumonia, bronchitis, laryngitis, etc. It accompanies chronic\r\nroaring, chronic bronchitis, broken wind; it may succeed influenza. As\r\npreviously stated, cough is but a symptom and not a disease in itself.\r\nChronic cough is occasionally associated with diseases other than those\r\nof the organs of respiration. It may be a symptom of chronic indigestion\r\nor of worms. In such cases it is caused by a reflex nervous irritation.\r\nThe proper treatment in all cases of chronic cough is to ascertain the\r\nnature of the disease of which it is a symptom, and then cure the\r\ndisease if possible and the cough will cease.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the affections will be found under their appropriate\r\nheads, to which the reader is referred.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEURODYNIA.\r\n\r\nThis is a form of rheumatism that affects the intercostal muscles; that\r\nis, the muscles between the ribs. The apparent symptoms are very similar\r\nto those of pleurisy. The animal is stiff and not inclined to turn\r\nround; the ribs are kept in a fixed state as much as possible. If the\r\nhead is pulled round suddenly, or the affected side struck with the\r\nhand, or if the spaces between the ribs are pressed with the fingers,\r\nthe animal will flinch and perhaps emit a grunt or groan expressive of\r\nmuch pain. It is distinguished from pleurisy by the absence of fever,\r\ncough, the friction sound, the effusion into the chest, and by the\r\nexistence of rheumatism in other parts. The treatment for this affection\r\nis the same as for rheumatism affecting other parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDS PENETRATING THE WALLS OF THE CHEST.\r\n\r\nA wound penetrating the wall of the chest admits air into the thoracic\r\ncavity outside the lung. This condition is known as pneumothorax and may\r\nresult in collapse of the lung. The wound may be so made that when the\r\nwalls of the chest are dilating a little air is sucked in, but during\r\nthe contraction of the wall the contained air presses against the torn\r\npart in such manner as entirely to close the wound; thus a small\r\nquantity of air gains access with each inspiration, while none is\r\nallowed to escape until the lung is pressed into a very small compass\r\nand forced into the anterior part of the chest. The same thing may occur\r\nfrom a broken rib inflicting a wound in the lung. In this form the air\r\ngains access from the lung, and there may not be even an opening in the\r\nwalls of the chest. In such cases the air may be absorbed, when a\r\nspontaneous cure is the result, but when the symptoms are urgent it is\r\nrecommended that the air be removed by a trocar and cannula or by an\r\naspirator.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the treatment of wounds that penetrate the thoracic\r\ncavity should be prompt. It should be quickly ascertained whether or not\r\na foreign body remains in the wound; then it should be thoroughly\r\ncleaned with a solution of carbolic acid, 1 part in 40 parts of water.\r\nThe wound should then be closed immediately. If it is an incised wound,\r\nit should be closed with sutures or with adhesive plasters; if torn or\r\nlacerated, adhesive plaster may be used or a bandage around the chest\r\nover the dressing. At all events, air must be prevented from getting\r\ninto the chest as soon and as effectually as possible. The after\r\ntreatment of the wound should consist principally in keeping the parts\r\nclean with a solution of carbolic acid, and applying fresh dressing as\r\noften as required to keep the wound in a healthy condition. Care should\r\nbe taken that the discharges from the wound have an outlet in the most\r\ndependent part. (See Wounds and their treatment, p. 484.) If pleurisy\r\nsupervenes, it should be treated as advised under that head.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHUMPS, OR SPASM OF THE DIAPHRAGM.\r\n\r\n\"Thumps\" is generally thought by the inexperienced to be a palpitation\r\nof the heart. While it is true that palpitation of the heart is\r\nsometimes called \"thumps,\" it must not be confounded with the affection\r\nunder consideration.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of this article on the diseases of the organs of\r\nrespiration, the diaphragm was briefly referred to as the principal and\r\nessential muscle of respiration. Spasmodic or irregular contractions of\r\nit in man are manifested by what is familiarly known as hiccoughs.\r\nThumps in the horse is similar to hiccoughs in man although in all cases\r\nthe peculiar noise is not made in the throat of the horse.\r\n\r\nThere should be no difficulty in distinguishing this affection from\r\npalpitation of the heart. The jerky motion affects the whole body, and\r\nis not confined to the region of the heart. If one hand is placed on the\r\nbody at about the middle of the last rib, while the other hand is placed\r\nover the heart behind the left elbow, it will be easily demonstrated\r\nthat there is no connection between the thumping or jerking of the\r\ndiaphragm and the beating of the heart. In fact, when the animal is\r\naffected with spasms of the diaphragm the beating of the heart is\r\nusually much weaker and less perceptible than natural. Thumps is\r\nproduced by causes similar to those that produce congestion of the lungs\r\nand dilatation or palpitation of the heart, and may occur in connection\r\nwith these conditions. If not relieved, death usually results from\r\ncongestion or edema of the lungs, as the breathing is interfered with\r\nby the inordinate action of this important muscle of inspiration so much\r\nthat proper aeration of the blood can not take place. The treatment\r\nshould be as prescribed for congestion of the lungs, and, in addition,\r\nantispasmodics, such as 1 ounce of sulphuric ether in warm water or 3\r\ndrams of asafetida.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUPTURE OF THE DIAPHRAGM.\r\n\r\nPost-mortem examinations after colic or severe accident sometimes reveal\r\nrupture of the diaphragm. This may take place after death, from the\r\ngeneration of gases in the decomposing carcass, which distend the\r\nintestines so that the diaphragm is ruptured by the great pressure\r\nagainst it. The symptoms are intensely difficult respiration and great\r\ndepression. There is no treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE URINARY ORGANS.\r\n\r\nBY JAMES LAW, F. R. C. V. S.,\r\n\r\n_Formerly Professor of Veterinary Science, etc., in Cornell University._\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF THE URINARY ORGANS.\r\n\r\nThe urinary organs constitute the main channel through which are\r\nexcreted the nitrogenous or albuminoid principles, whether derived\r\ndirectly from the feed or from the muscular and other nitrogenized\r\ntissues of the body. They constitute, besides, the channel through which\r\nare thrown out most of the poisons, whether taken in by the mouth or\r\nskin or developed in connection with faulty or natural digestion,\r\nblood-forming, nutrition, or tissue destruction; or, finally, poisons\r\nthat are developed within the body, as the result of normal cell life or\r\nof the life of bacterial or other germs that have entered the body from\r\nwithout. Bacteria themselves largely escape from the body through the\r\nkidneys. To a large extent, therefore, these organs are the sanitary\r\nscavengers and purifiers of the system, and when their functions are\r\nimpaired or arrested the retained poisons quickly show their presence in\r\nresulting disorders of the skin and connective tissue beneath it, of the\r\nnervous system, or other organs. Nor is this influence one-sided.\r\nScarcely an important organ of the body can suffer derangement without\r\nentailing a corresponding disorder of the urinary system. Nothing can be\r\nmore striking than the mutual balance maintained between the liquid\r\nsecretions of the skin and kidneys during hot and cold weather. In\r\nsummer, when so much liquid exhales through the skin as sweat,\r\ncomparatively little urine is passed, whereas in winter, when the skin\r\nis inactive, the urine is correspondingly increased. This vicarious\r\naction of skin and kidneys is usually kept within the limits of health,\r\nbut at times the draining off of the water by the skin leaves too little\r\nto keep the solids of the urine safely in solution, and these are liable\r\nto crystallize out and form stone and gravel. Similarly the passage, in\r\nthe sweat, of some of the solids that normally leave the body, dissolved\r\nin the urine, serves to irritate the skin and produce troublesome\r\neruptions.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROMINENT CAUSES OF URINARY DISORDERS.\r\n\r\nA disordered liver contributes to the production under different\r\ncircumstances of an excess of biliary coloring matter which stains the\r\nurine; of an excess of hippuric acid and allied products which, being\r\nless soluble than urea (the normal product of tissue change), favor the\r\nformation of stone, of taurocholic acid, and other bodies that tend when\r\nin excess to destroy the blood globules and to cause irritation of the\r\nkidneys by the resulting hemoglobin excreted in the urine, and of\r\nglycogen too abundant to be burned up in the system, which induces\r\nsaccharine urine (diabetes). Any disorder leading to impaired functional\r\nactivity of the lungs is causative of an excess of hippuric acid and\r\nallied bodies, of oxalic acid, of sugar, etc., in the urine, which\r\nirritate the kidneys, even if they do not produce solid deposits in the\r\nurinary passages. Diseases of the nervous system, and notably of the\r\nbase of the brain and of the spinal cord, induce various urinary\r\ndisorders, prominent among which are diabetes, chylous urine, and\r\nalbuminuria. Certain affections, with imperfect nutrition or destructive\r\nwaste of the bony tissues, tend to charge the urine with phosphates of\r\nlime and magnesia and endanger the formation of stone and gravel. In all\r\nextensive inflammations and acute fevers the liquids of the urine are\r\ndiminished, while the solids (waste products), which should form the\r\nurinary secretion, are increased, and the surcharged urine proves\r\nirritant to the urinary organs or the retained waste products poison the\r\nsystem at large.\r\n\r\nDiseases of the heart and lungs, by interfering with the free, onward\r\nflow of the blood from the right side of the heart, tend to throw that\r\nliquid back on the veins, and this backward pressure of venous blood\r\nstrongly tends to disorders of the kidneys. Certain poisons taken with\r\nthe feed and water, notably that found in magnesian limestone and those\r\nfound in irritant, diuretic plants, are especially injurious to the\r\nkidneys, as are also various cryptogams, whether in musty hay or oats.\r\nThe kidneys may be irritated by feeding green vegetables covered with\r\nhoar frost or by furnishing an excess of feed rich in phosphates (wheat\r\nbran, beans, peas, vetches, lentils, rape cake, cottonseed cake) or by a\r\nprivation of water, which entails a concentrated condition and high\r\ndensity of the urine. Exposure in cold rain or snow storms, cold drafts\r\nof air, and damp beds are liable to further disorder an already\r\noverworked or irritable kidney. Finally, sprains of the back and loins\r\nmay cause bleeding from the kidneys or inflammation.\r\n\r\nThe right kidney, weighing 23-1/2 ounces, is shaped like a French bean,\r\nand extends from the loins forward to beneath the heads of the last two\r\nribs. The left kidney (Pl. VIII) resembles a heart of cards, and extends\r\nfrom the loins forward beneath the head of the last rib only. Each\r\nconsists of three distinct parts--(a) the external (cortical), or\r\nvascular part, in which the blood vessels form elaborate capillary\r\nnetworks within the dilated globular sacs which form the beginnings of\r\nthe secreting (uriniferous) tubes and on the surface of the sinuous,\r\nsecreting tubes leading from the sacs inward toward the second, or\r\nmedullary, part of the organ; (b) the internal (medullary) part, made\r\nup in the main of blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves extending\r\nbetween the notch on the inner border of the kidney to and from the\r\nouter vascular portion, in which the secretion of urine is almost\r\nexclusively carried on; and (d) a large, saccular reservoir in the\r\ncenter of the kidney, into which all uriniferous tubes pour their\r\nsecretions and from which the urine is carried away through a tube g\r\n(ureter), which passes out of the notch at the inner border of the\r\nkidney and which opens by a valve-closed orifice into the roof of the\r\nbladder just in front of its neck. The bladder is a dilatable reservoir\r\nfor the retention of the urine until the discomfort of its presence\r\ncauses its voluntary discharge. It is kept closed by circular, muscular\r\nfibers surrounding its neck or orifice, and is emptied by looped,\r\nmuscular fibers extending in all directions forward from the neck around\r\nthe blind anterior end of the sac. From the bladder the urine escapes\r\nthrough a dilatable tube (urethra) which extends from the neck of the\r\nbladder backward on the floor of the pelvis, and in the male through the\r\npenis to its free end, where it opens through a pink, conical papilla.\r\nIn the mare the urethra is not more than an inch in length, and is\r\nsurrounded by the circular, muscular fibers closing the neck of the\r\nbladder. Its opening may be found directly in the median line of the\r\nfloor of the vulva, about 4-1/2 inches from its external opening.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL SYMPTOMS OF DISEASE.\r\n\r\nThese apply especially to acute inflammations and the irritation caused\r\nby stone. The animal moves stiffly on the hind limbs, straddles, and\r\nmakes frequent attempts to pass urine, which may be in excess, deficient\r\nin amount, liable to sudden arrest in spite of the straining, passed in\r\ndriblets, or entirely suppressed. Again, it may be modified in density\r\nor constituents. Difficulty in making a sharp turn, or in lying down and\r\nrising with or without groaning, dropping the back when mounted or when\r\npinched on the loins is suggestive of kidney disease, and so to a less\r\nextent are swelled legs, dropsy, and diseases of the skin and nervous\r\nsystem. The oiled hand introduced through the rectum may feel the\r\nbladder beneath and detect any overdistention, swelling, tenderness, or\r\nstone. In ponies the kidneys even may be reached.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION OF THE URINE.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the changes in the urine are the sole sign of disease. In\r\nhealth the horse's urine is of a deep amber color and has a strong odor.\r\nOn a feed of grain and hay it may show a uniform transparency, while on\r\na green ration there in an abundant white deposit of carbonate of lime.\r\nOf its morbid changes the following are to be looked for: (1) _Color_:\r\nWhite from deposited salts of lime; brown or red from blood clots or\r\ncoloring matter; yellow or orange from bile or blood pigment; pale from\r\nexcess of water; or variously colored from vegetable ingredients\r\n(santonin makes it red; rhubarb or senna, brown; tar or carbolic acid,\r\ngreen). (2) _Density_: The horse's urine may be 1.030 or 1.050, but it\r\nmay greatly exceed this in diabetes and may sink to 1.007 in diuresis.\r\n(3) _Chemical reaction_, as ascertained by blue litmus or red test\r\npapers. The horse on vegetable diet has alkaline urine turning red test\r\npapers blue, while in the sucking colt and the horse fed on flesh or on\r\nhis own tissue (in starvation or abstinence during disease) it is acid,\r\nturning blue litmus red. (4) _Organic constituents_, as when glairy from\r\nalbumen coagulable by strong nitric acid and boiling, when charged with\r\nmicroscopic casts of the uriniferous tubes, with the eggs or bodies of\r\nworms, with sugar, blood, or bile. (5) _In its salts_, which may\r\ncrystallize out spontaneously, or on boiling, or on the addition of\r\nchemical reagents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII.\r\n\r\nLONGITUDINAL SECTION THROUGH KIDNEY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IX.\r\n\r\nMICROSCOPIC ANATOMY OF KIDNEY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE X.\r\n\r\nMICROSCOPIC ANATOMY OF KIDNEY.]\r\n\r\nAlbuminous urine in the horse is usually glairy, so that it may be drawn\r\nout in threads, but its presence can always be tested as follows: If the\r\nliquid is opaque, it may be first passed through filter paper; if very\r\ndense and already precipitating its salts, it may be diluted with\r\ndistilled water; add to the suspected liquid acetic acid drop by drop\r\nuntil it reddens the blue litmus paper; then boil gently in a test tube;\r\nif a precipitate is thrown down, set the tube aside to cool and then add\r\nstrong nitric acid. If the precipitate is not dissolved, it is albumen;\r\nif dissolved it is probably urate or hippurate of ammonia. Albumen is\r\nnormally present in advanced gestation; abnormally it is seen in\r\ndiseases in which there occurs destruction of blood globules (anthrax,\r\nlow fevers, watery states of the blood, dropsies), in diseases of the\r\nheart and liver which prevent the free escape of blood from the veins\r\nand throw back venous pressure on the kidneys, in inflammation of the\r\nlungs and pleurae, and even tympany (bloating), doubtless from the same\r\ncause, and in all congestive or inflammatory diseases of the kidneys,\r\nacute or chronic.\r\n\r\nCasts of the uriniferous tubes can be seen only by placing the suspected\r\nurine under the microscope. They are usually very elastic and mobile,\r\nwaving about in the liquid when the cover glass is touched, and showing\r\na uniform, clear transparency (waxy) or entangled circular epithelial\r\ncells or opaque granules or flattened, red-blood globules or clear,\r\nrefrangent oil globules. They may be even densely opaque from crystals\r\nof earthy salts.\r\n\r\nPus cells may be found in the urine associated with albumen, and are\r\nrecognized by clearing up, when treated with acetic acid, so that each\r\ncell shows two or three nuclei.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIURESIS (POLYURIA, DIABETES INSIPIDUS, OR EXCESSIVE SECRETION OF\r\nURINE).\r\n\r\nThis consists in an excessive secretion of a clear, watery urine of a\r\nlow specific gravity (1.007) with a correspondingly ardent thirst, a\r\nrapidly advancing emaciation, and great loss of strength and spirit.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Its causes may be any agent--medicinal, alimentary, or\r\npoisonous--which unduly stimulates the kidneys; the reckless\r\nadministration of diuretics, which form such a common constituent of\r\nquack horse powders; acrid diuretic plants in grass or hay; new oats\r\nstill imperfectly cured; an excess of roots or other very watery feed; a\r\nfull allowance of salt to animals that have become inordinately fond of\r\nit; but, above all, feeding on hay, grain, or bran which has not been\r\nproperly dried and has become musty and permeated by fungi. Thus hay,\r\nstraw, or oats obtained in wet seasons and heating in the rick or stack\r\nis especially injurious. Hence this malady, like coma somnolentum\r\n(sleepy staggers), is widespread in wet seasons, and especially in rainy\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The horse drinks deep at every opportunity and passes urine\r\non every occasion when stopped, the discharge being pale, watery, of a\r\nlow density, and inodorous; in short, it contains a great excess of\r\nwater and a deficiency of the solid excretions. So great is the quantity\r\npassed, however, that the small amount of solids in any given specimen\r\namounts in 24 hours to far more than the normal--a fact in keeping with\r\nthe rapid wasting of the tissues and extreme emaciation. The flanks\r\nbecome tucked up, the fat disappears, the bones and muscles stand out\r\nprominently, the skin becomes tense and hidebound, and the hair erect,\r\nscurfy, and deficient in luster. The eye becomes dull and sunken, the\r\nspirits are depressed, the animal is weak and sluggish, sweats on the\r\nslightest exertion, and can endure little. The subject may survive for\r\nmonths, or may die early of exhaustion. In the slighter cases, or when\r\nthe cause ceases to operate, a somewhat tardy recovery may be made.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ consists in stopping the ingestion of the faulty drugs,\r\npoisons, or feed, and supplying sound hay and grain free from all taint\r\nof heating or mustiness. A liberal supply of boiled flaxseed in the\r\ndrinking water at once serves to eliminate the poison and to sheathe and\r\nprotect the irritated kidneys. Tonics like sulphate or phosphate of iron\r\n(2 drams morning and evening) and powdered gentian or Peruvian bark (4\r\ndrams) help greatly by bracing the system and hastening repair. To these\r\nmay be added agents calculated to destroy the fungus and eliminate its\r\npoisonous products. In that form which depends on musty food nothing\r\nacts better than large doses of iodid of potassium (2 drams), while in\r\nother cases creosote, carbolic acid (1 dram), or oil of turpentine (4\r\ndrams), properly diluted, may be resorted to.\r\n\r\n\r\nSACCHARINE DIABETES (DIABETES MELLITUS, GLYCOSURIA, OR INOSURIA).\r\n\r\nThis is primarily a disease of the nervous system or liver rather than\r\nof the kidneys, yet, as the most prominent symptom is the sweet urine,\r\nit may be treated here.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Its causes are varied, but resolve themselves largely into\r\ndisorder of the liver or disorder of the brain. One of the most\r\nprominent functions of the liver is the formation of glycogen, a\r\nprinciple allied to grape sugar, and passing into it by further\r\noxidation in the blood. This is a constant function of the liver, but in\r\nhealth the resulting sugar is burned up in the circulation and does not\r\nappear in the urine. On the contrary, when the supply of oxygen is\r\ndefective, as in certain diseases of the lungs, the whole of the sugar\r\ndoes not undergo combustion and the excess is excreted by the kidneys.\r\nAlso in certain forms of enlarged liver the quantity of sugar produced\r\nis more than can be disposed of in the natural way, and it appears in\r\nthe urine. A temporary sweetness of the urine often occurs after a\r\nhearty meal on starchy feed, but this is due altogether to the\r\nsuper-abundant supply of the sugar-forming feed, lasts for a few hours\r\nonly, and has no pathological significance. In many cases of fatal\r\nglycosuria the liver is found to be enlarged, or at least congested, and\r\nit is found that the disorder can be produced experimentally by agencies\r\nwhich produce an increased circulation through the liver. Thus Bernard\r\nproduced glycosuria by pricking the oblong medulla at the base of the\r\nbrain close to the roots of the pneumogastric nerve, which happens to be\r\nalso the nerve center (vasomotor) which presides over the contractions\r\nof the minute blood vessels. The pricking and irritation of this center\r\nleads to congestion of the liver and the excessive production of sugar.\r\nIrritation carried to this point through the pneumogastric nerve causes\r\nsaccharine urine, and, in keeping with this, disease of the pancreas has\r\nbeen found in this malady. The complete removal of the pancreas,\r\nhowever, determines glycosuria, the organ having in health an inhibitive\r\naction on sugar production by the liver. The same result follows the\r\nreflection of irritation from other sources, as from different ganglia\r\n(corpora striata, optic thalami, pons, cerebellum, cerebrum) of the\r\nbrain. Similarly it is induced by interruption of the nervous control\r\nalong the vasomotor tracts, as in destruction of the upper or lower\r\ncervical sympathetic ganglion, by cutting the nervous branch connecting\r\nthese two, in injury to the spinal marrow in the interval between the\r\nbrain and the second or fourth dorsal vertebra, or in disease of the\r\nceliac plexus, which directly presides over the liver. Certain chemical\r\npoisons also cause saccharine urine, notably woorara, strychnia,\r\nmorphia, phosphoric acid, alcohol, ether, quinia, chloroform, ammonia,\r\narsenic, and phlorizin.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are ardent thirst and profuse secretion of a\r\npale urine of a high density (1.060 and upward), rapid loss of\r\ncondition, scurfy, unthrifty skin, costiveness or irregularity of the\r\nbowels, indigestion, and the presence, in the urine, of a sweet\r\nprinciple--grape sugar or inosite, or both. This may be most promptly\r\ndetected by touching the tip of the tongue with a drop. Sugar may be\r\ndetected simply by adding a teaspoonful of liquid yeast to 4 ounces of\r\nthe urine and keeping it lightly stopped at a temperature of 70 deg. to 80 deg.\r\nF. for 12 hours, when the sugar will be found to have been changed into\r\nalcohol and carbon dioxid. The loss of density will give indication of\r\nthe quantity of sugar transformed; thus a density of 1.035 in a urine\r\nwhich was formerly 1.060 would indicate about 15 grains of sugar to the\r\nfluid ounce.\r\n\r\nInosite, or muscle sugar, frequently present in the horse's urine, and\r\neven replacing the glucose, is not fermentable. Its presence may be\r\nindicated by its sweetness and the absence of fermentation or by\r\nGallois's test. Evaporate the suspected urine at a gentle heat almost to\r\ndryness, then add a drop of a solution of mercuric nitrate and evaporate\r\ncarefully to dryness, when a yellowish residue is left that is changed\r\non further cautious heating to a deep rose color, which disappears on\r\ncooling and reappears on heating.\r\n\r\nIn advanced diabetes, dropsies in the limbs and under the chest and\r\nbelly, puffy, swollen eyelids, cataracts, catarrhal inflammation of the\r\nlungs, weak, uncertain gait, and drowsiness may be noted.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ is most satisfactory in cases dependent on some curable\r\ndisease of liver, pancreas, lungs, or brain. Thus, in liver diseases, a\r\nrun at pasture in warm weather, or in winter a warm, sunny, well-aired\r\nstable, with sufficient clothing and laxatives (sulphate of soda, 1\r\nounce daily) and alkalies (carbonate of potassium, one-fourth ounce) may\r\nbenefit. To this may be added mild blistering, cupping, or even leeching\r\nover the last ribs. Diseases of the brain or pancreas may be treated\r\naccording to their indications. The diet should be mainly albuminous,\r\nsuch as wheat bran or middlings, peas, beans, vetches, and milk. Indeed,\r\nan exclusive milk diet is one of the very best remedial agencies. It may\r\nbe given as skimmed milk or butter-milk, and in the last case combines\r\nan antidiabetic remedy in the lactic acid. Under such an exclusive diet\r\nrecent and mild cases are often entirely restored, though at the expense\r\nof an attack of rheumatism. Codeia, one of the alkaloids of opium, is\r\nstrongly recommended by Tyson. The dose for the horse would be 10 to 15\r\ngrains thrice daily. In cases in which there is manifest irritation of\r\nthe brain, bromid of potassium, 4 drams, or ergot one-half ounce, may be\r\nresorted to. Salicylic acid and salicylate of sodium have proved useful\r\nin certain cases; also phosphate of sodium. Bitter tonics (especially\r\nnux vomica one-half dram) are useful in improving the digestion and\r\ngeneral health.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEMATURIA (BLOODY URINE).\r\n\r\n_Cause._--As seen in the horse, bloody urine is usually the direct\r\nresult of mechanical injuries, as sprains and fractures of the loins,\r\nlacerations of the sublumbar muscles (psoas), irritation caused by stone\r\nin the kidney, ureter, bladder, or urethra. It may, however, occur with\r\nacute congestion of the kidney, with tumors in its substance, or with\r\npapilloma or other diseased growth in the bladder. Acrid diuretic plants\r\npresent in the feed may also lead to the escape of blood from the\r\nkidney. The predisposition to this affection is, however, incomparably\r\nless than in the case of the ox or the sheep, the difference being\r\nattributed to the greater plasticity of the horse's blood in connection\r\nwith the larger quantity of fibrin.\r\n\r\nThe blood may be present in small clots or in more or less intimate\r\nadmixture with the urine. Its condition may furnish some indication as\r\nto its source; thus, if from the kidneys it is more liable to be\r\nuniformly diffused through the urine, while as furnished by the bladder\r\nor passages clots are more liable to be present. Again, in bleeding from\r\nthe kidney, minute, cylindrical clots inclosing blood globules and\r\nformed in the uriniferous tubes can be detected under the microscope.\r\nPrecision also may be approximated by observing whether there is\r\ncoexisting fracture, sprain of the loins, or stone or tumor in the\r\nbladder or urethra.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The disease being mainly due to direct injury, treatment\r\nwill consist, first, in removing such cause whenever possible, and then\r\nin applying general and local styptics. Irritants in feed must be\r\navoided, sprains appropriately treated, and stone in bladder or urethra\r\nremoved. Then give mucilaginous drinks (slippery elm, linseed tea)\r\nfreely, and styptics (tincture of chlorid of iron 3 drams, acetate of\r\nlead one-half dram, tannic acid one-half dram, or oil of turpentine 1\r\nounce). If the discharge is abundant, apply cold water to the loins and\r\nkeep the animal perfectly still.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEMOGLOBINURIA (AZOTURIA, AZOTEMIA, POISONING BY ALBUMINOIDS).\r\n\r\nLike diabetes, this is rather a disease of the liver and blood-forming\r\nfunctions than of the kidney, but as prominent symptoms are loss of\r\ncontrol over the hind limbs and the passage of ropy and dark-colored\r\nurine, the vulgar idea is that it is a disorder of the urinary organs.\r\nIt is a complex affection directly connected with a plethora in the\r\nblood of nitrogenized constituents, with extreme nervous and muscular\r\ndisorder and the excretion of a dense reddish or brownish urine. It is\r\ndirectly connected with high feeding, especially on highly nitrogenized\r\nfeed (oats, beans, peas, vetches, cottonseed meal), and with a period of\r\nidleness in the stall under full rations. The disease is never seen at\r\npasture, rarely under constant daily work, even though the feeding is\r\nhigh, and the attack is usually precipitated by taking the horse from\r\nthe stable and subjecting it to exercise or work. The poisoning is not\r\npresent when taken from the stable, as the horse is likely to be\r\nnoticeably lively and spirited, but he will usually succumb under the\r\nfirst hundred yards or half mile of exercise. It seems as if the\r\naspiratory power of the chest under the sudden exertion and accelerated\r\nbreathing speedily drew from the gorged liver and abdominal veins\r\n(portal) the accumulated store of nitrogenous matter in an imperfectly\r\noxidized or elaborated condition, and as if the blood, surcharged with\r\nthese materials, were unable to maintain the healthy functions of the\r\nnerve centers and muscles. It has been noticed rather more frequently in\r\nmares than horses, attributable, perhaps, to the nervous excitement\r\nattendant on heat, and to the fact that the unmutilated mare is\r\nnaturally more excitable than the docile gelding.\r\n\r\nLignieres has found in hemoglobinuria a streptococcus which produced\r\nnephritis, bloody urine, and paraplegia in experimental animals,\r\nincluding horses.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--In the milder forms this affection may appear as a lameness\r\nin one limb, from indefinite cause, succeeding to some sudden exertion\r\nand attended by a dusky-brown color of the membranes of the eye and nose\r\nand some wincing when the last ribs are struck. The severe forms come on\r\nafter one or two days of rest on a full ration, when the animal has been\r\ntaken out and driven one hundred paces or more: The fire and life with\r\nwhich he had left the stable suddenly give place to dullness and\r\noppression, as shown in heaving flanks, dilated nostrils, pinched face,\r\nperspiring skin, and trembling body. The muscles of the loins or haunch\r\nbecome swelled and rigid, the subject moves stiffly or unsteadily,\r\ncrouches behind, the limbs being carried semiflexed, and he soon drops,\r\nunable to support himself. When down, the body and limbs are moved\r\nconvulsively, but there is no power of coordination of movement in the\r\nmuscles. The pulse and breathing are accelerated, the eyes red with a\r\ntinge of brown, and the urine, if passed, is seen to be highly colored,\r\ndark brown, red, or black, but it contains neither blood clots nor\r\nglobules. The color is mainly due to hemoglobin and other imperfectly\r\nelaborated constituents of the blood.\r\n\r\nIt may end fatally in a few hours or days, or a recovery may ensue,\r\nwhich is usually more speedy and perfect if it has set in at an early\r\nstage. In the late and tardy recoveries a partial paralysis of the hind\r\nlimbs may last for months. A frequent sequel of these tardy cases is an\r\nextensive wasting of the muscles leading up from the front of the stifle\r\n(those supplied by the crural nerve) and a complete inability to stand.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--The prevention of this serious affection lies in\r\nrestricting the diet and giving daily exercise when the animal is not at\r\nwork. A horse that has had one attack should never be left idle for a\r\nsingle day in the stall or barnyard. When a horse has been condemned to\r\nabsolute repose on good feeding he may have a laxative (one-half to 1\r\npound Glauber's salt), and have graduated exercise, beginning with a\r\nshort walk and increasing day by day.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment of the mild cases may consist in a laxative,\r\ngraduated daily exercise, and a daily dose of saltpeter (1 ounce).\r\nSudden attacks will sometimes promptly subside if taken on the instant\r\nand the subject kept still and calmed by a dose of bromid of potassium\r\n(4 drams) and sweet spirits of niter (1 ounce). The latter has the\r\nadvantage of increasing the secretion of the kidneys. Iodid of potassium\r\nin one-half ounce doses every four hours has succeeded well in some\r\nhands. In severe cases, as a rule, it is desirable to begin treatment by\r\na dose of aloes (4 to 6 drams) with the above-named dose of bromid of\r\npotassium, and this latter may be continued at intervals of four or six\r\nhours, as may be requisite to calm the nervous excitement. Fomentations\r\nwith warm water over the loins are always useful in calming the\r\nexcitable conditions of the spinal cord, muscles, liver, and kidneys,\r\nand also in favoring secretion from the two latter. On the second day\r\ndiuretics may be resorted to, such as saltpeter one-half ounce, and\r\npowdered colchicum, one-half dram, to be repeated twice daily. A\r\nlaxative may be repeated in three or four days should the bowels seem to\r\ndemand it, and as the nervous excitement disappears any remaining\r\nmuscular weakness or paralysis may be treated by one-half dram doses of\r\nnux vomica twice a day and a stimulating liniment (aqua ammonia and\r\nsweet oil in equal proportions) rubbed on the torpid muscles.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the disease friction to the limbs is useful, and in\r\nthe advanced paralytic stage the application of electricity along the\r\nline of the affected muscles. When the patient can not stand he must\r\nhave a thick, soft bed, and should be turned from side to side at least\r\nevery twelve hours. As soon as he can be made to stand he may be helped\r\nup and even supported in a sling.\r\n\r\n\r\nACUTE INFLAMMATION OF THE KIDNEYS, OR ACUTE NEPHRITIS.\r\n\r\nInflammations of the kidneys have been differentiated widely, according\r\nas they were acute or chronic, parenchymatous or tubal, suppurative or\r\nnot, with increased or shrunken kidney, etc. In a work like the present,\r\nhowever, utility will be consulted by classing all under acute or\r\nchronic inflammation.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--The causes of inflammation of the kidneys are extremely\r\nvaried. Congestion occurs from the altered and irritant products passed\r\nthrough these organs during recovery from inflammations of other organs\r\nand during fevers. This may last only during the existence of its cause,\r\nor may persist and become aggravated. Heart disease, throwing the blood\r\npressure back on the veins and kidneys, is another cause. Disease of the\r\nureter or bladder, preventing the escape of urine from the kidney and\r\ncausing increased fullness and tension in its pelvis and tubes, will\r\ndetermine inflammation. Decomposition of the detained urine in such\r\ncases and the production of ammonia and other irritants must also be\r\nnamed. In elimination of bacteria through the kidney, the latter is\r\nliable to infection with consequent inflammation. The advance of\r\nbacteria upward from the bladder to the kidneys is another cause. The\r\nconsumption in hay or other fodder of acrid or irritant plants,\r\nincluding fungi, the absorption of cantharidine from a surface blistered\r\nby Spanish flies, the reckless administration of diuretics, the presence\r\nof stones in the kidney, exposure of the surface to cold and wet, and\r\nthe infliction of blows or sprains on the loins, may contribute to its\r\nproduction. Liver disorders which throw on the kidneys the work of\r\nexcreting irritant products, diseases of the lungs and heart from which\r\nclots are carried, to be arrested in the small blood vessels of the\r\nkidney, and injuries and paralysis of the spinal cord, are additional\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are more or less fever, manifest stiffness of\r\nthe back and straddling gait with the hind limbs, difficulty in lying\r\ndown and rising, or in walking in a circle, the animal sometimes\r\ngroaning under the effort, arching of the loins and tucking up of the\r\nflank, looking back at the abdomen as if from colicky pain, and\r\ntenderness of the loins to pinching, especially just beneath the bony\r\nprocesses 6 inches to one side of the median line. Urine is passed\r\nfrequently, a small quantity at a time, of a high color, and sometimes\r\nmixed with blood or even pus. Under the microscope it shows the\r\nmicroscopic casts referred to under general symptoms. If treated by\r\nacetic acid, boiling and subsequent addition of strong nitric acid, the\r\nresulting and persistent precipitate indicates the amount of albumen.\r\nThe legs tend to swell from the foot up, also the dependent parts\r\nbeneath the belly and chest, and effusions of liquid may occur within\r\nthe chest or abdomen. In the male the alternate drawing up and\r\nrelaxation of the testicles in the scrotum are suggestive, and in small\r\nhorses the oiled hand introduced into the rectum may reach the kidney\r\nand ascertain its sensitiveness.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ demands, first, the removal of any recognized cause. Then,\r\nif the suffering and fever are high, 2 to 4 quarts of blood may be\r\nabstracted from the jugular vein; in weak subjects or unless in high\r\nfever this should be omitted. Next relieve the kidneys so far as\r\npossible by throwing their work on the bowels and skin. A pint of castor\r\noil is less likely than either aloes or salts to act on the kidneys. To\r\naffect the skin a warm stall and heavy clothing may be supplemented by\r\ndram doses of Dover's powder. Pain may be soothed by dram doses of\r\nbromid of potassium. Boiled flaxseed may be added to the drinking water,\r\nalso thrown into the rectum as an injection, and blankets saturated with\r\nhot water should be persistently applied to the loins. This may be\r\nfollowed by a very thin pulp of the best ground mustard made with tepid\r\nwater, rubbed in against the direction of the hair and covered with\r\npaper and a blanket. This may be kept on for an hour, or until the skin\r\nthickens and the hair stands erect. It may then be rubbed or sponged off\r\nand the blanket reapplied. When the action of the bowels has been\r\nstarted it may be kept up by a daily dose of 2 or 3 ounces of Glauber's\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\nDuring recovery a course of bitter tonics (nux vomica 1 scruple, ground\r\ngentian root 4 drams) should be given. The patient should also be\r\nguarded against cold, wet, and any active exertion for some time after\r\nall active symptoms have subsided.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONIC INFLAMMATION OF THE KIDNEYS.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Chronic inflammation of the kidneys is more commonly\r\nassociated with albumen and casts in the urine than the acute form, find\r\nin some instances these conditions of the urine may be the only\r\nprominent symptoms of the disease. Though it may supervene on blow,\r\ninjuries, and exposures, it is much more commonly connected with faulty\r\nconditions of the system--as indigestion, heart disease, lung or liver\r\ndisease, imperfect blood formation, or assimilation; in short, it is\r\nrather the attendant on a constitutional infirmity than on a simple\r\nlocal injury.\r\n\r\nIt may be associated with various forms of diseased kidneys, as\r\nshrinkage (atrophy), increase (hypertrophy), softening, red congestion,\r\nwhite enlargement, etc., so that it forms a group of diseases rather\r\nthan a disease by itself.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms may include stiffness, weakness, and increased\r\nsensibility of the loins, and modified secretion of urine (increase or\r\nsuppression), or the flow may be natural. Usually it contains albumen,\r\nthe quantity furnishing a fair criterion of the gravity of the\r\naffection, and microscopic casts, also most abundant in bad cases.\r\nDropsy, manifested in swelled legs, is a significant symptom, and if the\r\neffusion takes place along the lower line of the body or in chest or\r\nabdomen, the significance is increased. A scurfy, unthrifty skin,\r\nlack-luster hair, inability to sustain severe or continued exertion,\r\npoor or irregular appetite, loss of fat and flesh, softness of the\r\nmuscles, and pallor of the eyes and nose are equally suggestive. So are\r\nskin eruptions of various kinds. Any one or more of these symptoms would\r\nwarrant an examination of the urine for albumen and casts, the finding\r\nof which signifies renal inflammation.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ of these cases is not always satisfactory, as the cause is\r\nliable to be maintained in the disorders of important organs elsewhere.\r\nIf any such coincident disease of another organ or function can be\r\ndetected, that should be treated first or simultaneously with this\r\naffection of the kidneys. In all cases the building up of the general\r\nhealth is important. Hence a course of tonics may be given (phosphate of\r\niron 2 drams, nux vomica 20 grains, powdered gentian root 4 drams,\r\ndaily) or 60 drops of sulphuric acid or nitrohydrochloric acid may be\r\ngiven daily in the drinking water. If there is any elevated temperature\r\nof the body and tenderness of the loins, fomentations may be applied,\r\nfollowed by a mustard pulp, as for acute inflammation, and even in the\r\nabsence of these indications the mustard may be resorted to with\r\nadvantage at intervals of a few days. In suppression of urine,\r\nfomentations with warm water or with infusion of digitalis leaves is a\r\nsafer resort than diuretics, and cupping over the loins may also\r\nbenefit. To apply a cup, shave the skin and oil it; then take a\r\nnarrow-mouthed glass, rarify the air within it by introducing a taper in\r\nfull flame for a second, withdraw the taper and instantly apply the\r\nmouth of the glass to the skin and hold it closely applied till the\r\ncooling tends to form a vacuum in the glass and to draw up the skin,\r\nlike a sucker.\r\n\r\nAs in the acute inflammation, every attention must be given to secure\r\nwarm clothing, a warm stall, and pure air.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUMORS OF THE KIDNEYS.\r\n\r\nTumors, whether malignant or simple, would give rise to symptoms\r\nresembling some form of inflammation, and are not liable to be\r\nrecognized during life.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARASITES.\r\n\r\nTo parasites of the kidney belong the echinococcus, the larval, or\r\nbladder worm, stage of the small echinococcus tapeworm of the dog.\r\n_Dioctophyme renale_, the largest of roundworms, has been found in the\r\nkidney of the horse. Its presence can be certified only by the passage\r\nof its microscopic eggs or of the entire worm. Immature stages of\r\nroundworms, either _Strongylus equinus_ or a related species, may be\r\nfound in the renal artery or in the kidney itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPASM OF THE NECK OF THE BLADDER.\r\n\r\nThis affection consists in spasmodic closure of the outlet from the\r\nbladder by tonic contraction of the circular muscular fibers. It may be\r\naccompanied with a painful contraction of the muscles on the body of the\r\nbladder; or, if the organ is already unduly distended, these will be\r\naffected with temporary paralysis. It is most frequent in the horse, but\r\nby no means unknown in the mare.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--The causes are usually hard and continuous driving without\r\nopportunity for passing urine, cold rainstorms, drafts of cold air when\r\nperspiring and fatigued, the administration of Spanish fly or the\r\napplication of extensive blisters of the same, abuse of diuretics, the\r\npresence of acrid, diuretic plants in the fodder, and the presence of\r\nstone in the bladder. As most mares refuse to urinate while in harness,\r\nthey should be unhitched at suitable times for urination. Spasms of the\r\nbowels are always attended by spasm of the bladder, hence the free\r\npassage of water is usually a symptom of relief.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are frequent stretching and straining to\r\nurinate, with no result or a slight dribbling only. These vain efforts\r\nare attended by pain and groaning. On resuming his natural position the\r\nanimal is not freed from the pain, but moves uneasily, paws, shakes the\r\ntail, kicks at the abdomen with his hind feet, looks back to the flank,\r\nlies down and rises, arches the back, and attempts to urinate as before.\r\nIf the oiled hand is introduced into the rectum the greatly distended\r\nbladder may be felt beneath, and the patient will often shrink when it\r\nis handled.\r\n\r\nIt is important to notice that irritation of the urinary organs is often\r\npresent in impaction of the colon with solid matters, because the\r\nimpacted intestine under the straining of the patient is forced backward\r\ninto the pelvis and presses upon and irritates the bladder. In such\r\ncases the horse stands with his fore limbs advanced and the hind ones\r\nstretched back beyond the natural posture and makes frequent efforts to\r\nurinate, with varying success. Unpracticed observers naturally conclude\r\nthat the secondary urinary trouble is the main and only one, and the\r\nintestinal impaction and obstruction is too often neglected until it is\r\nirremediable. In cases in which the irritation has caused spasm of the\r\nneck of the bladder and overdistention of that organ, the mistake is\r\nstill more easily made; hence it is important in all cases to examine\r\nfor the impacted bowel, forming a bend or loop at the entrance of the\r\npelvis and usually toward the left side. The impacted intestine feels\r\nsoft and doughy and is easily indented with the knuckles, forming a\r\nmarked contrast with the tense, elastic, resilient, overdistended\r\nbladder.\r\n\r\nIt remains to be noted that similar symptoms may be determined by a\r\nstone or sebaceous mass, or stricture obstructing the urethra, or in the\r\nnewborn by thickened mucus in that duct and by the pressure of hardened,\r\nimpacted feces in the rectum. In obstruction, the hard, impacted body\r\ncan usually be felt by tracing the urethra along the lower and posterior\r\nsurface of the penis and forward to the median line of the floor of the\r\npelvis to the neck of the bladder. That part of the urethra between the\r\nseat of obstruction and the bladder is usually distended with urine and\r\nfeels enlarged, elastic, and fluctuating.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment may be begun by taking the animal out of\r\nharness. This failing, spread clean litter beneath the belly or turn the\r\npatient out on the dung heap. Some seek to establish sympathetic action\r\nby pouring water from one vessel into another with dribbling noise.\r\nOthers soothe and distract the attention by slow whistling. Friction of\r\nthe abdomen with wisps of straw may succeed, or it may be rubbed with\r\nammonia and oil. These failing, an injection of 2 ounces of laudanum or\r\nof an infusion of 1 ounce of tobacco in water may be tried. In the mare\r\nthe neck of the bladder is easily dilated by inserting two oiled fingers\r\nand slightly parting them. In the horse the oiled hand introduced into\r\nthe rectum may press from before backward on the anterior or blind end\r\nof the bladder. Finally, a well-oiled gum-elastic catheter may be\r\nentered into the urethra through the papilla at the end of the penis and\r\npushed on carefully until it has entered the bladder. To effect this the\r\npenis must first be withdrawn from its sheath, and when the advancing\r\nend of the catheter has reached the bend of the urethra beneath the anus\r\nit must be guided forward by pressure with the hand, which guidance must\r\nbe continued onward into the bladder, the oiled hand being introduced\r\ninto the rectum for this purpose. The horse catheter, 3-1/2 feet long\r\nand one-third inch in diameter, may be bought of a surgical-instrument\r\nmaker.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARALYSIS OF THE BLADDER.\r\n\r\nParalysis of the body of the bladder with spasm of the neck has been\r\ndescribed under the last heading, and may occur in the same way from\r\noverdistention in tetanus, acute rheumatism, paraplegia, and hemiplegia,\r\nin which the animal can not stretch himself to urinate, and in cystitis,\r\naffecting the body of the bladder but not the neck. In all these cases\r\nthe urine is suppressed. It also occurs as a result of disease of the\r\nposterior end of the spinal marrow and with broken back, and is then\r\nassociated with palsy of the tail, and, it may be, of the hind limbs.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are a constant dribbling of urine when the\r\nneck is involved, the liquid running down the inside of the thighs and\r\nirritating the skin. When the neck is unaffected the urine is retained\r\nuntil the bladder is greatly overdistended, when it may be expelled in a\r\ngush by the active contraction of the muscular walls of the abdomen;\r\nthis never empties the bladder, however, and the oiled hand introduced\r\nthrough the rectum may feel the soft, flabby organ still half full of\r\nurine. This retained urine is liable to decompose and give off ammonia,\r\nwhich dissolves the epithelial cells, exposing the raw, mucous membrane\r\nand causing the worst type of cystitis. Suppression and incontinence of\r\nurine are common also to obstruction of the urethra by stone or\r\notherwise; hence this source of fallacy should be excluded by manual\r\nexamination along the whole course of that duct.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment is only applicable in cases in which the\r\ndetermining cause can be abated. In remedial sprains of the back or\r\ndisease of the spinal cord these must have appropriate treatment, and\r\nthe urine must be drawn off frequently with a catheter to prevent\r\noverdistention and injury to the bladder. If the paralysis persists\r\nafter recovery of the spinal cord, or if it continues after relief of\r\nspasm of the neck of the bladder, apply a pulp of mustard and water over\r\nthe back part of the belly in front of the udder, and cover with a rug\r\nuntil the hair stands erect. In the male the mustard may be applied\r\nbetween the thighs from near the anus downward. Daily doses of 2 drams\r\nextract of belladonna or of 2 grains powdered Spanish fly may serve to\r\nrouse the lost tone. These failing, a mild current of electricity daily\r\nmay succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE BLADDER (CYSTITIS, OR UROCYSTITIS).\r\n\r\nCystitis may be slight or severe, acute or chronic, partial or general.\r\nIt may be caused by abuse of diuretics, especially such as are\r\nirritating (cantharides, turpentine, copaiba, resin, etc.), by the\r\npresence of a stone or gravel in the bladder, the irritation of a\r\ncatheter or other foreign body introduced from without, the septic\r\nferment (bacterium) introduced on a filthy catheter, the overdistention\r\nof the bladder by retained urine, the extrication of ammonia from\r\nretained decomposing urine, resulting in destruction of the epithelial\r\ncells and irritation of the raw surface, and a too concentrated and\r\nirritating urine. The application of Spanish flies or turpentine over a\r\ntoo extensive surface, sudden exposure of a perspiring and tired horse\r\nto cold or wet, and the presence of acrid plants in the fodder may cause\r\ncystitis, as they may nephritis. Finally, inflammation may extend from a\r\ndiseased vagina or urethra to the bladder.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are slight or severe colicky pains; the animal\r\nmoves his hind feet uneasily or even kicks at the abdomen, looks around\r\nat his flank, and may even lie down and rise frequently. More\r\ncharacteristic are frequently repeated efforts to urinate, resulting in\r\nthe discharge of a little clear, or red, or more commonly flocculent\r\nurine, always in jets, and accompanied with signs of pain, which persist\r\nafter the discharge, as shown in continued straining, groaning, and\r\nperhaps in movements of the feet and tail. The penis hangs from the\r\nsheath, or in the mare the vulva is frequently opened and closed, as\r\nafter urination. The animal winces when the abdomen is pressed in the\r\nregion of the sheath or udder, and the bladder is found to be sensitive\r\nand tender when pressed with the oiled hand introduced through the\r\nrectum or vagina. In the mare the thickening of the walls of the bladder\r\nmay be felt by introducing one finger through the urethra. The\r\ndischarged urine, which may be turbid or even oily, contains an excess\r\nof mucus, with flat shreds of membrane, with scaly epithelial cells, and\r\npus corpuscles, each showing two or more nuclei when treated with acetic\r\nacid, but there are no microscopic tubular casts, as in nephritis. If\r\ndue to stone in the bladder, that will be found on examination through\r\nrectum or vagina.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ implies, first, the removal of the cause, whether poisons in\r\nfeed or as medicine, the removal of Spanish flies or other blistering\r\nagents from the skin, or the extraction of stone or gravel. If the urine\r\nhas been retained and decomposed it must be completely evacuated through\r\na clean catheter, and the bladder thoroughly washed out with a solution\r\nof 1 dram of borax in a quart of water. This must be repeated twice\r\ndaily until the urine no longer decomposes, because so long as ammonia\r\nis developed in the bladder the protecting layer of epithelial cells\r\nwill be dissolved and the surface kept raw and irritable. The diet must\r\nbe light (bran mashes, roots, fresh grass), and the drink impregnated\r\nwith linseed tea, or solution of slippery elm or marsh mallow. The same\r\nagents may be used to inject into the rectum, or they may even be used\r\nalong with borax and opium to inject into bladder (gum arabic 1 dram,\r\nopium 1 dram, tepid water 1 pint). Fomentations over the loins are often\r\nof great advantage, and these may be followed or alternated with the\r\napplication of mustard, as in paralysis; or the mustard may be applied\r\non the back part of the abdomen below or between the thighs from the\r\nanus downward. Finally, when the acute symptoms have subsided, a daily\r\ndose of buchu 1 dram and nux vomica one-half dram will serve to restore\r\nlost tone.\r\n\r\n\r\nIRRITABLE BLADDER.\r\n\r\nSome horses, and especially mares, show an irritability of the bladder\r\nand nerve centers presiding over it by frequent urination in small\r\nquantities, though the urine is not manifestly changed in character and\r\nno more than the natural quantity is passed in the twenty-four hours.\r\nThe disorder appears to have its source quite as frequently in the\r\ngenerative or nervous system as in the urinary. A troublesome and\r\ndangerous form is seen in mares, which dash off and refuse all control\r\nby the rein if driven with a full bladder, but usually prove docile if\r\nthe bladder has been emptied before hitching. In other cases the\r\nexcitement connected with getting the tail over the reins is a powerful\r\ndetermining cause. The condition is marked in many mares during the\r\nperiod of heat.\r\n\r\nAn oleaginous laxative (castor oil 1 pint) will serve to remove any\r\ncause of irritation in the digestive organs, and a careful dieting will\r\navoid continued irritation by acrid vegetable agents. The bladder should\r\nbe examined to see that there is no stone or other cause of irritation,\r\nand the sheath and penis should be washed with soapsuds, any sebaceous\r\nmatter removed from the bilocular cavity at the end of the penis, and\r\nthe whole lubricated with sweet oil. Irritable mares should be induced\r\nto urinate before they are harnessed, and those that clutch the lines\r\nunder the tail may have the tail set high by cutting the cords on its\r\nlower surface, or it may be prevented from getting over the reins by\r\nhaving a strap carried from its free end to the breeching. Those proving\r\ntroublesome when \"in heat\" may have 4-dram doses of bromid of potassium,\r\nor they may be served by the male or castrated. Sometimes irritability\r\nmay be lessened by daily doses of belladonna extract (1 dram), or a\r\nbetter tone may be given to the parts by balsam copaiba (1 dram).\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASED GROWTHS IN THE BLADDER.\r\n\r\nThese may be of various kinds, malignant or simple. In the horse I have\r\nfound villous growths from the mucous membrane especially troublesome.\r\nThey may be attached to the mucous membrane by a narrow neck or by a\r\nbroad base covering a great part of the organ.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are frequent straining, passing of urine and\r\nblood with occasionally gravel. An examination of the bladder with the\r\nhand in the rectum will detect the new growth, which may be\r\ndistinguished from a hard, resistant stone. In mares, in which the\r\nfinger can be inserted into the bladder, the recognition is still more\r\nsatisfactory. The polypi attached by narrow necks may be removed by\r\nsurgical operation, but for those with broad attachments treatment is\r\neminently unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCHARGE OF URINE BY THE NAVEL, OR PERSISTENT URACHUS.\r\n\r\nThis occurs only in the newborn, and consists in the nonclosure of the\r\nnatural channel (urachus), through which the urine is discharged into\r\nthe outer water bag (allantois) in fetal life. At that early stage of\r\nthe animal existence the bladder resembles a long tube, which is\r\nprolonged through the navel string and opens into the outermost of the\r\ntwo water bags in which the fetus floats. In this way the urine is\r\nprevented from entering the inner water bag (amnion), where it would\r\nmingle with the liquids, bathing the skin of the fetus and cause\r\nirritation. At birth this channel closes up, and the urine takes the\r\ncourse normal to extra-uterine life. Imperfect closure is more frequent\r\nin males than in females, because of the great length and small caliber\r\nof the male urethra and its consequent tendency to obstruction. In the\r\nfemale there may be a discharge of a few drops only at a time, while in\r\nthe male the urine will be expelled in strong jets coincidently with the\r\ncontractions of the bladder and walls of the abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe first care is to ascertain whether the urethra is pervious by\r\npassing a human catheter. This determined, the open urachus may be\r\nfirmly closed by a stout, waxed thread, carried with a needle through\r\nthe tissues back of the opening and tied in front of it so as to inclose\r\nas little skin as possible. If a portion of the naval string remains,\r\nthe tying of that may be all sufficient. It is important to tie as early\r\nas possible so as to avoid inflammation of the navel from contact with\r\nthe urine. In summer a little carbolic-acid water or tar water may be\r\napplied to keep the flies off.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVERSION OF THE BLADDER.\r\n\r\nThis can occur only in the female. It consists in the turning of the\r\norgan outside in through the channel of the urethra, so that it appears\r\nas a red, pear-shaped mass hanging from the floor of the vulva and\r\nprotruding externally between its lips. It may be a mass like the fist,\r\nor it may swell up to the size of an infant's head. On examining its\r\nupper surface the orifices of the urethra maybe seen, one on each side,\r\na short distance behind the neck, with the urine oozing from them drop\r\nby drop.\r\n\r\nThis displacement usually supervenes on a flaccid condition of the\r\nbladder, the result of paralysis, overdistention, or severe compression\r\nduring a difficult parturition.\r\n\r\nThe protruding organ may be washed with a solution of 1 ounce of\r\nlaudanum and a teaspoonful of carbolic acid in a quart of water, and\r\nreturned by pressing a smooth, rounded object into the fundus and\r\ndirecting it into the urethra, while careful pressure is made on the\r\nsurrounding parts with the other hand. If too large and resistant it may\r\nbe wound tightly in a strip of bandage about 2 inches broad to express\r\nthe great mass of blood and exudate and diminish the bulk of the\r\nprotruded organ so that it can be easily pushed back. This method has\r\nthe additional advantage of protecting the organ against bruises and\r\nlacerations in the effort made to return it. After the return, straining\r\nmay be kept in check by giving laudanum (1 to 2 ounces) and by applying\r\na truss to press upon the lips of the vulva. (See Eversion of the womb.)\r\nThe patient should be kept in a stall a few inches lower in front than\r\nbehind, so that the action of gravity will favor retention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XI.\r\n\r\nCALCULI AND INSTRUMENT FOR REMOVAL.]\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE URETHRA (URETHRITIS, OR GLEET).\r\n\r\nThis affection belongs quite as much to the generative organs, yet it\r\ncan not be entirely overlooked in a treatise on urinary disorders. It\r\nmay be induced by the same causes as cystitis (which see); by the\r\npassage and temporary arrest of small stones, or gravel; by the\r\nirritation caused by foreign bodies introduced from without; by blows on\r\nthe penis by sticks, stones, or by the feet of a mare that kicks while\r\nbeing served; by an infecting inflammation contracted from a mare served\r\nin the first few days after parturition or one suffering from\r\nleucorrhea; by infecting matter introduced on a dirty catheter, or by\r\nthe extension of inflammation from an irritated, bilocular cavity filled\r\nwith hardened sebaceous matter, or from an uncleansed sheath.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are swelling, heat, and tenderness of the\r\nsheath and penis; difficulty, pain, and groaning in passing urine, which\r\nis liable to sudden temporary arrests in the course of micturition, and\r\nlater a whitish, mucopurulent oozing from the papilla on the end of the\r\npenis. There is a tendency to erection of the penis, and in cases\r\ncontracted from a mare the outer surface of that organ will show more or\r\nless extensive sores and ulcers. Stallions suffering in this way will\r\nrefuse to mount or, having mounted, will fail to complete the act of\r\ncoition. If an entrance is effected, infection of the mare is liable to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ in the early stages consists in a dose of physic (aloes 6\r\ndrams) and fomentations of warm water to the sheath and penis. If there\r\nis reason to suspect the presence of infection, inject the urethra twice\r\ndaily with borax 1 dram, tepid water 1 quart. When the mucopurulent\r\ndischarge indicates the supervention of the second stage a more\r\nastringent injection may be used (nitrate of silver 20 grains, water 1\r\nquart), and the same may be applied to the surface of the penis and\r\ninside the sheath. Balsam of copaiba (1 dram daily) may also be given\r\nwith advantage after the purulent discharge has appeared.\r\n\r\nEvery stallion suffering from urethritis should be withheld from\r\nservice, as should mares with leucorrhea.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRICTURE OF THE URETHRA.\r\n\r\nThis is a permanent narrowing of the urethra at a given point, the\r\nresult of previous inflammation, caused by the passage or arrest of a\r\nstone, or gravel, by strong astringent injections in the early\r\nnonsecreting stage of urethritis, or by contraction of the lining\r\nmembrane occurring during the healing of ulcers in neglected\r\ninflammations of that canal. The trouble is shown by the passage of\r\nurine in a fine stream, with straining, pain, and groaning, and by\r\nfrequent painful erections. It must be remedied by mechanical\r\ndilatation, with catheters just large enough to pass with gentle force,\r\nto be inserted once a day, and to be used of larger size as the passage\r\nwill admit them. The catheter should be kept perfectly clean and washed\r\nin a borax solution and well oiled before it is introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nURINARY CALCULI (STONE, OR GRAVEL).\r\n\r\nThese consist in some of the solids of the urine that have been\r\nprecipitated from the urine in the form of crystals, which remain apart\r\nas a fine, powdery mass, or magma, or aggregate into calculi, or stones,\r\nof varying size. (See Pl. XI.) Their composition is therefore determined\r\nin different animals by the salts or other constituents found dissolved\r\nin the healthy urine, and by the additional constituents which may be\r\nthrown off in solution in the urine in disease. In this connection it is\r\nimportant to observe the following analysis of the horse's urine in\r\nhealth:\r\n\r\n    Water                                       918.5\r\n    Urea                                         13.4\r\n    Uric acid and urates                           .1\r\n    Hippuric acid                                26.4\r\n    Lactic acid and lactates                      1.2\r\n    Mucus and organic matter                     22.0\r\n    Sulphates (alkaline)                          1.2\r\n    Phosphates (lime and soda)                     .2\r\n    Chlorids (sodium)                             1.0\r\n    Carbonates (potash, magnesia, lime)          16.0\r\n                                                -----\r\n                                               1000.0\r\n\r\nThe carbonate of lime, which is present in large quantity in the urine\r\nof horses fed on green fodder, is practically insoluble, and therefore\r\nforms in the passages after secretion, and its microscopic rounded\r\ncrystals give the urine of such horses a milky whiteness. It is this\r\nmaterial which constitutes the soft, white, pultaceous mass that\r\nsometimes fills the bladder to repletion and requires to be washed out.\r\nIn hay-fed horses carbonates are still abundant, while in those mainly\r\ngrain-fed they are replaced by hippurates and phosphates--the products\r\nof the wear of tissues--the carbonates being the result of oxidation of\r\nthe vegetable acids in the feed. Carbonate of lime, therefore, is a very\r\ncommon constituent of urinary calculi in herbivora, and in many cases is\r\nthe most abundant constituent.\r\n\r\nOxalate of lime, like carbonate of lime, is derived from the burning up\r\nof the carbonaceous matter of the feed in the system, one important\r\nfactor being the less perfect oxidation of the carbon. Indeed,\r\nFuestenberg and Schmidt have demonstrated on man, horse, ox, and rabbit\r\nthat under the full play of the breathing (oxidizing) forces oxalic\r\nacid, like other organic acids, is resolved into carbonic acid. In\r\nkeeping with this is the observation of Lehmann, that in all cases in\r\nwhich man suffered from interference with the breathing oxalate of lime\r\nappeared in the urine. An excess of oxalate of lime in the urine may,\r\nhowever, claim a different origin. Uric and hippuric acids are found in\r\nthe urine of carnivora and herbivora, respectively, as the result of the\r\nhealthy wear (disassimilation) of nitrogenous tissues. If these products\r\nare fully oxidized, however, they are thrown out in the form of the more\r\nsoluble urea rather than as these acids. When uric acid out of the body\r\nis treated with peroxid of lead it is resolved into urea, allantoin, and\r\noxalic acid, and Woehler and Frerrichs found that the administration\r\nof uric acid not only increased the excretion of urea but also of oxalic\r\nacid. It may therefore be inferred that oxalic acid is not produced from\r\nthe carbonaceous feed alone but also from the disintegration of the\r\nnitrogenous tissues of the body. An important element of its production\r\nis, however, the imperfect performance of the breathing functions, and\r\nhence it is liable to result from diseases of the chest (heaves, chronic\r\nbronchitis, etc.). This is, above all, liable to prove the case if the\r\nsubject is fed to excess on highly carbonaceous feeds (grass and green\r\nfeed generally, potatoes, etc.).\r\n\r\nCarbonate of magnesia, another almost constant ingredient of the urinary\r\ncalculi of the horse, is formed the same way as the carbonate of\r\nlime--from the excess of carbonaceous feed (organic acids) becoming\r\noxidized into carbon dioxid, which unites with the magnesia derived from\r\nthe feed.\r\n\r\nThe phosphates of lime and magnesia are not abundant in urinary calculi\r\nof the horse, the phosphates being present to excess in the urine in\r\nonly two conditions--(a) when the ration is excessive and especially\r\nrich in phosphorus (wheat, bran, beans, peas, vetches, rape cake, oil\r\ncake, cottonseed cake); and (b) when, through the morbid, destructive\r\nchanges in the living tissues, and especially of the bones, a great\r\nquantity of phosphorus is given off as a waste product. Under these\r\nconditions, however, the phosphates may contribute to the formation of\r\ncalculi, and this, above all, is liable if the urine is retained in the\r\nbladder until it has undergone decomposition and given off ammonia. The\r\nammonia at once unites with the phosphate of magnesia to form a double\r\nsalt--phosphate of ammonia and magnesia--which, being insoluble, is at\r\nonce precipitated. The precipitation of this salt is, however, rare in\r\nthe urine of the horse, though much more frequent in that of man and\r\nsheep.\r\n\r\nThese are the chief mineral constituents of the urine which form\r\ningredients in the horse's calculi, for though iron and manganese are\r\nusually present it is only in minute quantities.\r\n\r\nThe excess of mineral matter in a specimen of urine unquestionably\r\ncontributes to the formation of calculi, just as a solution of such\r\nmatters out of the body is increasingly disposed to throw them down in\r\nthe form of crystals as it becomes more concentrated and approaches\r\nnearer to the condition of saturation. Hence, in considering the causes\r\nof calculi we can not ignore the factor of an excessive ration, rich in\r\nmineral matters and in carbonaceous matters (the source of carbonates\r\nand much of the oxalates), nor can we overlook the concentration of the\r\nurine that comes from dry feed and privation of water, or from the\r\nexistence of fever which causes suspension of the secretion of water. In\r\nthese cases, at least the usual quantity of solids is thrown off by the\r\nkidneys, and as the water is diminished there is danger of its\r\napproaching the point of supersaturation, when the dissolved solids must\r\nnecessarily be thrown down. Hence, calculi are more common in stable\r\nhorses fed on dry grain and hay, in those denied a sufficiency of water\r\nor that have water supplied irregularly, in those subjected to profuse\r\nperspiration (as in summer), and in those suffering from a watery\r\ndiarrhea. On the whole, calculi are most commonly found in winter,\r\nbecause the horses are then on dry feeding, but such dry feeding is even\r\nmore conducive to them in summer when the condition is aggravated by the\r\nabundant loss of water by the skin.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the extreme hardness of the water in certain districts\r\nmust be looked upon as contributing to the concentration of the urine\r\nand correspondingly to the production of stone. The carbonates,\r\nsulphates, etc., of lime and magnesia taken in the water must be again\r\nthrown out, and just in proportion as these add to the solids of the\r\nurine they dispose it to precipitate its least soluble constituents.\r\nThus the horse is very subject to calculi on certain limestone soils, as\r\nover the calcareous formations of central and western New York,\r\nPennsylvania, and Ohio, in America; of Norfolk, Suffolk, Derbyshire,\r\nShropshire, and Gloucestershire, in England; of Poitou and Landes, in\r\nFrance; and Munich, in Bavaria.\r\n\r\nThe saturation of the urine from any or all of these conditions can only\r\nbe looked on as an auxiliary cause, however, and not as in itself an\r\nefficient one, except on the rarest occasions. For a more direct and\r\nimmediate cause we must look to the organic matter which forms a large\r\nproportion of all urinary calculi. This consists of mucus, albumen, pus,\r\nhyaline casts of the uriniferous tubes, epithelial cells, blood, etc.,\r\nmainly agents that belong to the class of colloid or noncrystalline\r\nbodies. A horse may live for months and years with the urine habitually\r\nof a high density and having the mineral constituents in excess without\r\nthe formation of stone or gravel; again, one with dilute urine of low\r\nspecific gravity will have a calculus.\r\n\r\nRainey, Ord, and others furnish the explanation. They not only show that\r\na colloid body, like mucus, albumen, pus, or blood, determined the\r\nprecipitation or the crystalline salts in the solution, but they\r\ndetermined the precipitation in the form of globules, or spheres,\r\ncapable of developing by further deposits into calculi. Heat intensifies\r\nthis action of the colloids, and a colloid in a state of decomposition\r\nis specially active. The presence, therefore, of developing fungi and\r\nbacteria must be looked upon as active factors in causing calculi.\r\n\r\nIn looking, therefore, for the immediate causes of calculi we must\r\nconsider especially all those conditions which determine the presence of\r\nalbumen, blood, and excess of mucus, pus, etc., in the urine. Thus\r\ndiseases of distant organs leading to albuminuria, diseases of the\r\nkidneys and urinary passages causing the escape of blood or the\r\nformation of mucus or pus, become direct causes of calculi. Foreign\r\nbodies of all kinds in the bladder or kidney have long been known as\r\ndetermining causes of calculi and as forming the central nucleus. This\r\nis now explained by the fact that these bodies are liable to carry\r\nbacteria into the passages and thus determine decomposition, and they\r\nare further liable to irritate the mucous membrane and become enveloped\r\nin a coating of mucus, pus, and perhaps blood.\r\n\r\nThe fact that horses, especially on the magnesian limestones, the same\r\ndistricts in which they suffer from goiter, appear to suffer from\r\ncalculi may be similarly explained. The unknown poison which produces\r\ngoiter presumably leads to such changes in the blood and urine as will\r\nfurnish the colloid necessary for precipitation of the urinary salts in\r\nthe form of calculi.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF URINARY CALCULI.\r\n\r\nThese have been named according to the place where they are found, renal\r\n(kidney), ureteric (ureter), vesical (bladder), urethral (urethra), and\r\npreputial (sheath, or prepuce). They have been otherwise named according\r\nto their most abundant chemical constituent, carbonate of lime, oxalate\r\nof lime, and phosphate of lime calculi. The stones formed of carbonates\r\nor phosphates are usually smooth on the surface, though they may be\r\nmolded into the shape of the cavity in which they have been formed; thus\r\nthose in the pelvis of the kidney may have two or three short branchlike\r\nprolongations, while those in the bladder are round, oval, or slightly\r\nflattened upon each other. Calculi containing oxalate of lime, on the\r\nother hand, have a rough, open, crystalline surface, which has gained\r\nfor them the name of mulberry calculi, from a supposed resemblance to\r\nthat fruit. These are usually covered with more or less mucus or blood,\r\nproduced by the irritation of the mucous membrane by their rough\r\nsurfaces. The color of calculi varies from white to yellow and deep\r\nbrown, the shades depending mainly on the amount of the coloring matter\r\nof blood, bile, or urine which they may contain.\r\n\r\n_Renal calculi._--These may consist of minute, almost microscopic,\r\ndeposits in the uriniferous tubes in the substance of the kidney, but\r\nmore commonly they are large masses and lodged in the pelvis. The larger\r\ncalculi, sometimes weighing 12 to 24 ounces, are molded in the pelvis of\r\nthe kidney into a cylindroid mass, with irregular rounded swellings at\r\nintervals. Some have a deep brown, rough, crystalline surface of oxalate\r\nof lime, while others have a smooth, pearly white aspect from carbonate\r\nof lime. A smaller calculus, which has been called coralline, is also\r\ncylindroid, with a number of brown, rough, crystalline oxalate of lime\r\nbranches and whitish depressions of carbonate. These vary in size from\r\n15 grains to nearly 2 ounces. Less frequently are found masses of very\r\nhard, brownish white, rounded, pealike calculi. These are smoother, but\r\non the surface crystals of oxalate of lime may be detected with a lens.\r\nSome renal calculi are formed of more distinct layers, more loosely\r\nadherent to one another, and contain an excess of mucus, but no oxalate\r\nof lime. Finally, a loose aggregation of small masses, forming a very\r\nfriable calculus, is found of all sizes within the limits of the pelvis\r\nof the kidney. These, too, are in the main carbonate of lime (84 to 88\r\nper cent) and without oxalate.\r\n\r\nSymptoms of renal calculi are violent, colicky, pains, appearing\r\nsuddenly, very often in connection with exhausting work or the drawing\r\nof specially heavy loads, and in certain cases disappearing with equal\r\nsuddenness. The nature of the colic becomes more manifest if it is\r\nassociated with stiffness of the back and hind limbs, frequent passage\r\nof urine, and, above all, the passage of gravel with the urine,\r\nespecially at the time of the access of relief. The passage of blood and\r\npus in the urine is equally significant. If the irritation of the kidney\r\ngoes on to active inflammation, then the symptoms of nephritis are\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n_Ureteric calculi._--These are so called because they are found in the\r\npassage leading from the kidney to the bladder. They are simply small,\r\nrenal calculi which have escaped from the pelvis of the kidney and have\r\nbecome arrested in the ureter. They give rise to symptoms almost\r\nidentical with those of renal calculi, with this difference, that the\r\ncolicky pains, caused by the obstruction of the ureter by the impacted\r\ncalculus, are more violent, and if the calculus passes on into the\r\nbladder the relief is instantaneous and complete. If the ureter is\r\ncompletely blocked for a length of time, the retained urine may give\r\nrise to destructive inflammation in the kidney, which may end in the\r\nentire absorption of that organ, leaving only a fibrous capsule\r\ncontaining an urinous fluid. If both the ureters are similarly blocked,\r\nthe animal will die of uremic poisoning.\r\n\r\n_Treatment of renal and ureteric calculi._--Treatment is unsatisfactory,\r\nas it is only the small calculi that can pass through the ureters and\r\nescape into the bladder. This may be favored by agents which will relax\r\nthe walls of the ureters by counteracting their spasm and even lessening\r\ntheir tone, and by a liberal use of water and watery fluids to increase\r\nthe urine and the pressure upon the calculus from behind. One or two\r\nounces of laudanum, or 2 drams of extract of belladonna, may be given\r\nand repeated as it may be necessary, the relief of the pain being a fair\r\ncriterion of the abating of the spasm. To the same end use warm\r\nfomentations across the loins, and these should be kept up persistently\r\nuntil relief is obtained. These act not only by soothing and relieving\r\nthe spasm and inflammation, but they also favor the freer secretion of a\r\nmore watery urine, and thus tend to carry off the smaller calculi. To\r\naccomplish this object further give cool water freely, and let the feed\r\nbe only such as contains a large proportion of liquid, gruels, mashes,\r\nturnips, beets, apples, pumpkins, ensilage, succulent grasses, etc. If\r\nthe acute stage has passed and the presence of the calculus is\r\nmanifested only by the frequent passage of urine with gritty particles,\r\nby stiffness of the loins and hind limbs, and by tenderness to pressure,\r\nthe most promising resort is a long run at pasture where the grasses are\r\nfresh and succulent. The long-continued secretion of a watery urine will\r\nsometimes cause the breaking down of a calculus, as the imbibition of\r\nthe less dense fluid by the organic, spongelike framework of the\r\ncalculus causes it to swell and thus lessens its cohesion. The same end\r\nis sought by the long-continued use of alkalies (carbonate of\r\npotassium), and of acids (muriatic), each acting in a different way to\r\nalter the density and cohesion of the stone. It is only exceptionally,\r\nhowever, that any one of these methods is entirely satisfactory. If\r\ninflammation of the kidneys develops, treat as advised under that head.\r\n\r\n_Stone in the bladder (vesical calculus, or cystic calculus)._--These\r\nmay be of any size up to over a pound in weight. One variety is rough\r\nand crystalline and has a yellowish-white or deep-brown color. These\r\ncontain about 87 per cent carbonate of lime, the remainder being\r\ncarbonate of magnesia, oxalate of lime, and organic matter. The\r\nphosphatic calculi are smooth, white and formed of thin, concentric\r\nlayers of great hardness extending from the nucleus outward. Besides the\r\nphosphate of lime they contain the carbonates of lime and magnesia and\r\norganic matter. In some cases the bladder contains and may be even\r\ndistended by a soft, pultaceous mass made up of minute, round granules\r\nof carbonates of lime and magnesia. This, when removed and dried, makes\r\na firm, white, and stony mass. Sometimes this magma is condensed into a\r\nsolid mass in the bladder by reason of the binding action of the mucus\r\nand other organic matter, and then forms a conglomerate stone of nearly\r\nuniform consistency and without stratification.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms of stone in the bladder._--The symptoms of stone in the\r\nbladder are more obvious than those of renal calculus. The rough,\r\nmulberry calculi especially lead to irritation of the mucous membrane\r\nand frequent passing of urine in small quantities and often mingled with\r\nmucus or blood or containing minute, gritty particles. At times the flow\r\nis suddenly arrested, though the animal continues to strain and the\r\nbladder is not quite emptied. In the smooth, phosphatic variety the\r\nirritation is much less marked and may even be altogether absent. With\r\nthe pultaceous deposit in the bladder there is incontinence of urine,\r\nwhich dribbles away continually and keeps the hair on the inner side of\r\nthe thighs matted with soft magma. In all cases alike the calculus may\r\nbe felt by the examination of the bladder with the oiled hand in the\r\nrectum. The pear-shaped outline of the bladder can be felt beneath, and\r\nwithin it the solid, oval body. It is most easily recognized if the\r\norgan is half full of liquid, as then it is not grasped by the\r\ncontracting walls of the bladder, but may be made to move from place to\r\nplace in the liquid. If a pultaceous mass is present it has a soft,\r\ndoughy feeling, and when pressed an indentation is left.\r\n\r\nIn the mare the hard stone may be touched by the finger introduced\r\nthrough the short urethra.\r\n\r\n_Treatment of stone in the bladder._--The treatment of stone in the\r\nbladder consists in the removal of the offending body; in the mare this\r\nis easily effected with the lithotomy forceps. These are slightly warmed\r\nand oiled, and carried forward along the floor of the passage of the\r\nvulva for 4 inches, when the orifice of the urethra will be felt exactly\r\nin the median line. Through this the forceps are gradually pushed with\r\ngentle, oscillating movement until they enter the bladder and strike\r\nagainst the hard surface of the stone. The stone is now grasped between\r\nthe blades, care being taken to include no loose fold of the mucous\r\nmembrane, and it is gradually withdrawn with the same careful,\r\noscillating motions as before. Facility and safety in seizing the stone\r\nwill be greatly favored by having the bladder half full of liquid, and\r\nif necessary one oiled hand may be introduced into the rectum or vagina\r\nto assist. The resulting irritation may be treated by an injection of\r\nlaudanum, 1 ounce in a pint of tepid water.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the stone in the horse is a much more difficult\r\nproceeding. It consists in cutting into the urethra just beneath the\r\nanus and introducing the lithotomy forceps from this forward into the\r\nbladder, as in the mare. It is needful to distend the urethra with\r\ntepid water or to insert a sound or catheter to furnish a guide upon\r\nwhich the incision may be made, and in case of a large stone it may be\r\nneedful to enlarge the passage by cutting in a direction upward and\r\noutward with a probe-pointed knife, the back of which is slid along in\r\nthe groove of a director until it enters the bladder.\r\n\r\nThe horse may be operated upon in the standing position, being simply\r\npressed against the wall by a pole passed from before backward along the\r\nother side of the body. The tepid water is injected into the end of the\r\npenis until it is felt to fluctuate under the pressure of the finger, in\r\nthe median line over the bone just beneath the anus. The incision is\r\nthen made into the center of the fluctuating canal, and from above\r\ndownward. When a sound or catheter is used as a guide it is inserted\r\nthrough the penis until it can be felt through the skin at the point\r\nwhere the incision is to be made beneath the anus. The skin is then\r\nrendered tense by the thumb and fingers of the left hand pressing on the\r\ntwo sides of the sound, while the right hand, armed with a scalpel, cuts\r\ndownward onto the catheter. This vertical incision into the canal should\r\nescape wounding any important blood vessel. It is in making the\r\nobliquely lateral incision in the subsequent dilatation of the urethra\r\nand neck of the bladder that such danger is to be apprehended.\r\n\r\nIf the stone is too large to be extracted through the urethra, it may be\r\nbroken down with the lithotrite and extracted piecemeal with the\r\nforceps. The lithotrite is an instrument composed of a straight stem\r\nbent for an inch or more to one side at its free end so as to form an\r\nobtuse angle, and having on the same side a sliding bar moving in a\r\ngroove in the stem and operated by a screw so that the stone may be\r\nseized between the two blades at its free extremity and crushed again\r\nand again into pieces small enough to extract. Extra care is required to\r\navoid injury to the urethra in the extraction of the angular fragments,\r\nand the gravel or powder that can not be removed in this way must be\r\nwashed out, as advised below.\r\n\r\nWhen a pultaceous magma of carbonate of lime accumulates in the bladder\r\nit must be washed out by injecting water through a catheter by means of\r\na force pump or a funnel, shaking it up with the hand introduced through\r\nthe rectum and allowing the muddy liquid to flow out through the tube.\r\nThis is to be repeated until the bladder is empty and the water come\r\naway, clear. A catheter with a double tube is sometimes used, the\r\ninjection passing in through the one tube and escaping through the\r\nother. The advantage is more apparent than real, however, as the\r\nretention of the water until the magma has been shaken up and mixed with\r\nit hastens greatly its complete evacuation.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the formation of a new deposit any fault in feeding (dry\r\ngrain and hay with privation of water, excess of beans, peas, wheat\r\nbran, etc.) and disorders of stomach, liver, and lungs must be\r\ncorrected. Give abundance of soft drinking water, encouraging the animal\r\nto drink by a handful of salt daily. Let the feed be laxative,\r\nconsisting largely of roots, apples, pumpkins, ensilage, and give daily\r\nin the drinking water a dram of either carbonate of potash or soda.\r\nPowdered gentian root (3 drams daily) will also serve to restore the\r\ntone of the stomach and system at large.\r\n\r\n_Urethral calculus (stone in the urethra)._--This is less frequent in\r\nhorses than in cattle and sheep, owing to the larger size of the urethra\r\nin the horse and the absence of the <b>S</b>-shaped curve and vermiform\r\nappendix. The calculi arrested in the urethra are never formed there,\r\nbut consist of cystic calculi which have been small enough to pass\r\nthrough the neck of the bladder, but are too large to pass through the\r\nwhole length of the urethra and escape. Such calculi therefore are\r\nprimarily formed either in the bladder or kidney, and have the chemical\r\ncomposition of the other calculi found in those organs. They may be\r\narrested at any point of the urethra, from the neck of the bladder back\r\nto the bend of the tube beneath the anus, and from that point down to\r\nthe extremity of the penis. I have found them most frequently in the\r\npapilla on the extreme end of the penis, and immediately behind this.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms of urethral calculus._--The symptoms are violent straining to\r\nurinate, but without any discharge, or with the escape of water in drops\r\nonly. Examination of the end of the penis will detect the swelling of\r\nthe papilla or the urethra behind it, and the presence of a hard mass in\r\nthe center. A probe inserted into the urethra will strike against the\r\ngritty calculus. If the stone has been arrested higher up, its position\r\nmay be detected as a small, hard, sensitive knot on the line of the\r\nurethra, in the median line of the lower surface of the penis, or on the\r\nfloor of pelvis in the median line from the neck of the bladder back to\r\nthe bend of the urethra beneath the anus. In any case the urethra\r\nbetween the neck of the bladder and the point of obstruction is liable\r\nto be filled with fluid, and to feel like a distended tube, fluctuating\r\non pressure.\r\n\r\n_Treatment of urethral calculus_ may be begun by an attempt to extract\r\nthe calculi by manipulation of the papilla on the end of the penis. This\r\nfailing, the calculus may be seized with a pair of fine-pointed forceps\r\nand withdrawn from the urethra; or, if necessary, a probe-pointed knife\r\nmay be inserted and the urethra slightly dilated, or even laid open, and\r\nthe stone removed. If the stone has been arrested higher up it must be\r\nextracted by a direct incision through the walls of the urethra and down\r\nupon the nodule. If in the free (protractile) portion of the penis,\r\nthat organ is to be withdrawn from its sheath until the nodule is\r\nexposed and can be incised. If behind the scrotum, the incision must be\r\nmade in the median line between the thighs and directly over the nodule,\r\nthe skin having been rendered tense by the fingers and thumb of the left\r\nhand. If the stone has been arrested in the intrapelvic portion of the\r\nurethra, the incision must be made beneath the anus and the calculus\r\nextracted with forceps, as in stone in the bladder. The wound in the\r\nurethra may be stitched up, and usually heals slowly but satisfactorily.\r\nHealing will be favored by washing two or three times daily with a\r\nsolution of a teaspoonful of carbolic acid in a pint of water.\r\n\r\n_Preputial calculus (calculus in the sheath, or bilocular\r\ncavity)._--These are concretions in the sheath, though the term has been\r\nalso applied to the nodule of sebaceous matter which accumulates in the\r\nblind pouches (bilocular cavity) by the sides of the papilla on the end\r\nof the penis. Within the sheath the concretion may be a soft,\r\ncheesy-like sebaceous matter, or a genuine calculus of carbonate,\r\noxalate, phosphate and sulphate of lime, carbonate of magnesia, and\r\norganic matter. These are easily removed with the fingers, after which\r\nthe sheath should be washed out with castile soap and warm water and\r\nsmeared with sweet oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE GENERATIVE ORGANS.\r\n\r\nBy JAMES LAW, F. R. C. V. S.,\r\n\r\nFormerly Professor of Veterinary Science, etc., in Cornell University.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGESTION AND INFLAMMATION OF THE TESTICLES, OR ORCHITIS.\r\n\r\nIn the prime of life, in vigorous health, and on stimulating feed,\r\nstallions are subject to congestion of the testicles, which become\r\nswollen, hot, and tender, but without any active inflammation. A\r\nreduction of the grain in the feed, the administration of 1 or 2 ounces\r\nof Glauber's salt daily in the feed, and the bathing of the affected\r\norgans daily with tepid water or alum water will usually restore them to\r\na healthy condition.\r\n\r\nWhen the factors producing congestion are extraordinarily potent, when\r\nthere has been frequent copulation and heavy grain feeding, when the\r\nweather is warm and the animal has had little exercise, and when the\r\nproximity of other horses or mares excites the generative instinct\r\nwithout gratification, this congestion may grow to actual inflammation.\r\nAmong the other causes of orchitis are blows and penetrating wounds\r\nimplicating the testicles, abrasions of the scrotum by a chain or rope\r\npassing inside the thigh, contusions and frictions on the gland under\r\nrapid paces or heavy draft, compression of the blood vessels of the\r\nspermatic cord by the inguinal ring under the same circumstances, and,\r\nfinally, sympathetic disturbance in cases of disease of the kidneys,\r\nbladder, or urethra. Stimulants of the generative functions, like rue,\r\nsavin, tansy, cantharides, and damiana, may also be accessory causes of\r\ncongestion and inflammation. Finally, certain specific diseases, like\r\ndourine, glanders, and tuberculosis, localized in the testicles, will\r\ncause inflammation.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Apart from actual wounds of the parts, the symptoms of\r\norchitis are swelling, heat, and tenderness of the testicles, straddling\r\nwith the hind legs alike in standing and walking, stiffness and dragging\r\nof the hind limbs or of the limb on the affected side, arching of the\r\nloins, abdominal pain, manifested by glancing back at the flank, more or\r\nless fever, elevated body temperature, accelerated pulse and breathing,\r\nlack of appetite, and dullness. In bad cases the scanty urine may be\r\nreddish and the swelling may extend to the skin and envelopes of the\r\ntesticle, which may become thickened and doughy, pitting on pressure.\r\nThe swelling may be so much greater in the convoluted excretory duct\r\nalong the upper border of the testicle as to suggest the presence of a\r\nsecond stone. Even in the more violent attacks the intense suffering\r\nabates somewhat on the second or third day. If it lasts longer, it is\r\nliable to give rise to the formation of matter (abscess). In exceptional\r\ncases the testicle is struck with gangrene, or death. Improvement may go\r\non slowly to complete recovery, or the malady may subside into a\r\nsubacute and chronic form with induration. Matter (abscess) may be\r\nrecognized by the presence of a soft spot, where pressure with two\r\nfingers will detect fluctuation from one to the other. When there is\r\nliquid exudation into the scrotum, or sac, fluctuation may also be felt,\r\nbut the liquid can be made out to be around the testicle and can be\r\npressed up into the abdomen through the inguinal canal. When abscess\r\noccurs in the cord the matter may escape into the scrotal sac and cavity\r\nof the abdomen and pyemia may follow.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ consists in perfect rest and quietude, the administration of\r\na purgative (1 to 1-1/2 pounds Glauber's salt), and the local\r\napplication of an astringent lotion (acetate of lead 2 drams, extract of\r\nbelladonna 2 drams, and water 1 quart) upon soft rags or cotton wool,\r\nkept in contact with the part by a suspensory bandage. This bandage, of\r\ngreat value for support, may be made nearly triangular and tied to a\r\ngirth around the loins and to the upper part of the same surcingle by\r\ntwo bands carried backward and upward between the thighs. In severe\r\ncases scarifications one-fourth inch deep serve to relieve vascular\r\ntension. When abscess is threatened its formation may be favored by warm\r\nfomentations or poultices, and on the occurrence of fluctuation the\r\nknife may be used to give free escape to the pus. The resulting cavity\r\nmay be injected daily with a weak carbolic-acid lotion, or salol may be\r\nintroduced. The same agents may be used on a gland threatened with\r\ngangrene, but its prompt removal by castration is to be preferred,\r\nantiseptics being applied freely to the resulting cavity.\r\n\r\n\r\nSARCOCELE.\r\n\r\nThis is an enlarged and indurated condition of the gland, resulting from\r\nchronic inflammation, though it is often associated with a specific\r\ndeposit, like glanders. In this condition the natural structure of the\r\ngland has given place to embryonal tissue (small, round cells, with a\r\nfew fibrous bundles), and its restoration to health is very improbable.\r\nApart from active inflammation, it may increase very slowly. The\r\ndiseased testicle is enlarged, firm, nonelastic, and comparatively\r\ninsensible. The skin of the scrotum is tense, and it may be edematous\r\n(pitting on pressure), as are the deeper envelopes and spermatic cord.\r\nIf liquid is present in the sac, the symptoms are masked somewhat. As it\r\nincreases it causes awkward, straddling, dragging movement of the hind\r\nlimbs, or lameness on the affected side. The spermatic cord often\r\nincreases at the same time with the testicle, and the inguinal ring\r\nbeing thereby stretched and enlarged, a portion of intestine may escape\r\ninto the sac, complicating the disease with hernia.\r\n\r\nThe only rational and effective treatment is castration, and when the\r\ndisease is specific (glanders, tuberculosis), even this may not succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDROCELE, OR DROPSY OF THE SCROTUM.\r\n\r\nThis may be merely an accompaniment of dropsy of the abdomen, the cavity\r\nof which is continuous with that of the scrotum in horses. It may be the\r\nresult, however, of local disease in the testicle, spermatic cord, or\r\nwalls of the sac.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are enlargement of the scrotum, and\r\nfluctuation under the fingers, the testicle being recognized as floating\r\nin water. By pressure the liquid is forced, in a slow stream and with a\r\nperceptible thrill, into the abdomen. Sometimes the cord or the scrotum\r\nis thickened and pits on pressure.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ may be the same as for ascites, yet when the effusion has\r\nresulted from inflammation of the testicle or cord, astringent\r\napplications (chalk and vinegar) may be applied to these. Then, if the\r\nliquid is not reabsorbed under diuretics and tonics, it may be drawn off\r\nthrough the nozzle of a hypodermic syringe which has been first passed\r\nthrough carbolic acid. In geldings it is best to dissect out the sacs.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARICOCELE.\r\n\r\nThis is an enlargement of the venous network of the spermatic cord, and\r\ngives rise to general thickening of the cord from the testicle up to the\r\nring. The same astringent dressings may be tried as in hydrocele, and,\r\nthis failing, castration may be resorted to.\r\n\r\n\r\nABNORMAL NUMBER OF TESTICLES.\r\n\r\nSometimes one or both testicles are wanting; in most such cases,\r\nhowever, they are merely partially developed, and retained in the\r\ninguinal canal or abdomen (cryptorchid). In rare cases there may be a\r\nthird testicle, the animal becoming to this extent a double monster.\r\nTeeth, hair, and other indications of a second fetus have likewise been\r\nfound in the testicle or scrotum.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEGENERATION OF THE TESTICLES.\r\n\r\nThe testicles may become the seat of fibrous, calcareous, fatty,\r\ncartilaginous, or cystic degeneration, for all which the appropriate\r\ntreatment is castration. They also become the seat of cancer, glanders,\r\nor tuberculosis, and castration is requisite, though with less hope of\r\narresting the disease. Finally, they may become infested with cystic\r\ntapeworms or the agamic stage of a strongyle (_Strongylus edentatus_).\r\n\r\n\r\nWARTS ON THE PENIS.\r\n\r\nThese are best removed by twisting them off, using the thumb and\r\nforefinger. They may also be cut off with scissors and the roots\r\ncauterized with nitrate of silver.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEGENERATION OF PENIS (PAPILLOMA, OR EPITHELIOMA).\r\n\r\nThe penis of the horse is subject to great cauliflower-like growths on\r\nits free end, which extend back into the substance of the organ,\r\nobstruct the passage of urine, and cause very fetid discharges. The only\r\nresort is to cut them off, together with whatever portion of the penis\r\nhas become diseased and indurated. The operation, which should be\r\nperformed by a veterinary surgeon, consists in cutting through the organ\r\nfrom its upper to its lower aspect, twisting or tying the two dorsal\r\narteries, and leaving the urethra longer by half an inch to 1 inch than\r\nthe adjacent structures.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRAVASATION OF BLOOD IN THE PENIS.\r\n\r\nAs the result of kicks, blows, or of forcible striking of the penis on\r\nthe thighs of the mare which it has failed to enter, the penis may\r\nbecome the seat of effusion of blood from one or more ruptured blood\r\nvessels. This gives rise to a more or less extensive swelling on one or\r\nmore sides, followed by some heat and inflammation, and on recovery a\r\nserious curving of the organ. The treatment in the early stages may be\r\nthe application of lotions, of alum, or other astringents, to limit the\r\neffusion and favor absorption. The penis should be suspended in a sling.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARALYSIS OF THE PENIS.\r\n\r\nThis results from blows and other injuries, and also in some cases from\r\ntoo frequent and exhausting service. The penis hangs from the sheath,\r\nflaccid, pendulous, and often cold. The passage of urine occurs with\r\nlessened force, and especially without the final jets. In cases of local\r\ninjury the inflammation should first be subdued by astringent and\r\nemollient lotions, and in all cases the system should be invigorated by\r\nnourishing diet, while 30-grain doses of nux vomica are given twice a\r\nday. Finally, a weak current of electricity sent through the penis from\r\njust beneath the anus to the free portion of the penis, continued for 10\r\nor 15 minutes and repeated daily, may prove successful.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELF-ABUSE, OR MASTURBATION.\r\n\r\nSome stallions acquire this vicious habit, stimulating the sexual\r\ninstinct to the discharge of semen by rubbing the penis against the\r\nbelly or between the fore limbs. The only remedy is a mechanical one,\r\nthe fixing of a net under the penis in such fashion as to prevent the\r\nextension of the penis or so prick the organ as to compel the animal to\r\ndesist through pain.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOURINE.\r\n\r\nThis disease is discussed in the chapter on \"Infectious Diseases.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTRATION OF STALLIONS.\r\n\r\nThis is usually done at 1 year old, but may be accomplished at a few\r\nweeks old at the expense of an imperfect development of the fore parts.\r\nThe simplicity and safety of the operation are greatest in the young.\r\nThe delay till 2, 3, or 4 years old will secure a better development and\r\ncarriage of the fore parts. The essential part of castration is the safe\r\nremoval or destruction of the testicle and the arrest or prevention of\r\nbleeding from the spermatic artery round in the anterior part of the\r\ncord. Into the many methods of accomplishing this limited space forbids\r\nus to enter here, so that only the method most commonly adopted,\r\ncastration by clamps, will be noticed. The animal having been thrown on\r\nhis left side, and the right hind foot drawn up on the shoulder, the\r\nexposed scrotum, penis, and sheath are washed with soap and water, any\r\nconcretion of sebum being carefully removed from the bilocular cavity in\r\nthe end of the penis. The left spermatic cord, just above the testicle,\r\nis now seized in the left hand, so as to render the skin tense over the\r\nstone, and the right hand, armed with the knife, makes an incision from\r\nbefore backward, about three-fourths of an inch from and parallel to the\r\nmedian line between the thighs, deep enough to expose the testicle and\r\nlong enough to allow that organ to start out through the skin. At the\r\nmoment of making this incision the left hand must grasp the cord very\r\nfirmly, otherwise the sudden retraction of the testicle by the cremaster\r\nmuscle may draw it out of the hand and upward through the canal and even\r\ninto the abdomen. In a few seconds, when the struggle and retraction\r\nhave ceased, the knife is inserted through the cord, between its\r\nanterior and posterior portions, and the latter, the one which the\r\nmuscle retracts, is cut completely through. The testicle will now hang\r\nlimp, and there is no longer any tendency to retraction. It should be\r\npulled down until it will no longer hang loose below the wound and the\r\nclamps applied around the still attached portion of the cord, close up\r\nto the skin. The clamps, which may be made of any tough wood, are\r\ngrooved along the center of the surfaces opposed to each other, thereby\r\nfulfilling two important indications--(a) enabling the clamps to hold\r\nmore securely and (b) providing for the application of an antiseptic\r\nto the cord. For this purpose a dram of sulphate of copper may be mixed\r\nwith an ounce of vaseline and pressed into the groove in the face of\r\neach clamp. In applying the clamp over the cord it should be drawn so\r\nclose with pincers as to press out all blood from the compressed cord\r\nand destroy its vitality, and the cord applied upon the compressing\r\nclamps should be so hard-twined that it will not stretch later and\r\nslacken the hold. When the clamp has been fixed the testicle is cut off\r\none-half to 1 inch below it, and the clamp may be left thus for 24\r\nhours; then, by cutting the cord around one end of the clamp, the latter\r\nmay be opened and the stump liberated without any danger of bleeding.\r\nShould the stump hang out of the wound it should be pushed inside with\r\nthe finger and left there. The wound should begin to discharge white\r\nmatter on the second day in hot weather or the third in cold, and from\r\nthat time a good recovery may be expected.\r\n\r\nThe young horse suffers less from castration than the old, and very\r\nrarely perishes. Good health in the subject is all important. Castration\r\nshould never be attempted during the prevalence of strangles, influenza,\r\ncatarrhal fever, contagious pleurisy, bronchitis, pneumonia, purpura\r\nhemorrhagica, or other specific disease, nor on subjects that have been\r\nkept in close, ill-ventilated, filthy buildings, where the system is\r\nliable to have been charged with putrid bacteria or other products. Warm\r\nweather is to be preferred to cold, but the fly time should be avoided\r\nor the flies kept at a distance by the application of a watery solution\r\nof tar, carbolic acid, or camphor to the wound.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTRATION OF CRYPTORCHIDS (RIDGLINGS).\r\n\r\nThis is the removal of a testicle or testicles that have failed to\r\ndescend into the scrotum, but have been detained in the inguinal canal\r\nor inside the abdomen. The manipulation requires an accurate anatomical\r\nknowledge of the parts, and special skill, experience, and manual\r\ndexterity, and can not be made clear to the unprofessional mind in a\r\nshort description. It consists, however, in the discovery and removal of\r\nthe missing gland by exploring through the natural channel (the inguinal\r\ncanal), or, in case it is absent, through the inguinal ring or through\r\nan artificial opening made in front and above that channel between the\r\nabdominal muscles and the strong fascia on the inner side of the thigh\r\n(Poupart's ligament). Whatever method is used, the skin, hands, and\r\ninstruments should be rendered aseptic with a solution of mercuric\r\nchlorid 1 part, water 2,000 parts (a carbolic-acid lotion for the\r\ninstruments), and the spermatic cord is best torn through by the\r\necraseur. In many such cases, too, it is desirable to sew up the\r\nexternal wound and keep the animal still, to favor healing of the wound\r\nby adhesion.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS FOLLOWING CASTRATION.\r\n\r\n_Pain after castration._--Some horses are pained and very restless for\r\nseveral hours after castration, and this may extend to cramps of the\r\nbowels and violent colic. This is best kept in check by carefully\r\nrubbing the patient dry when he rises from the operation, and then\r\nleading him in hand for some time. If the pain still persists a dose of\r\nlaudanum (1 ounce for an adult) may be given.\r\n\r\n_Bleeding after castration._--Bleeding from the wound in the scrotum and\r\nfrom the little artery in the posterior portion of the spermatic cord\r\nalways occurs, and in warm weather may appear to be quite free. It\r\nscarcely ever lasts, however, more than 15 minutes, and is easily\r\nchecked by dashing cold water against the part.\r\n\r\nBleeding from the spermatic artery in the anterior part of the cord may\r\nbe dangerous when due precaution has not been taken to prevent it. In\r\nsuch case the stump of the cord should be sought for and the artery\r\ntwisted with artery forceps or tied with a silk thread. If the stump can\r\nnot be found, pledgets of tow wet with tincture of muriate of iron may\r\nbe stuffed into the canal to favor the formation of clot and the closure\r\nof the artery.\r\n\r\n_Strangulated spermatic cord._--If in castration the cord is left too\r\nlong, so as to hang out of the wound, the skin wound in contracting\r\ngrasps and strangles it, preventing the free return of blood and causing\r\na steadily advancing swelling. In addition the cord becomes adherent to\r\nthe lips of the wound in the skin, whence it derives an increased supply\r\nof blood, and is thereby stimulated to more rapid swelling. The subject\r\nwalks stiffly, with a straddling gait, loses appetite, and has a rapid\r\npulse and high fever. Examination of the wound discloses the partial\r\nclosure of the skin wound and the protrusion, from its lips, of the end\r\nof the cord, red, tense, and varying in size from a hazelnut upward. If\r\nthere is no material swell and little protrusion, the wound may be\r\nenlarged with the knife and the end of the cord broken loose from any\r\nconnection with the skin and pushed up inside. If the swelling is\r\nlarger, the mass constitutes a tumor and must be removed. (See below.)\r\n\r\n_Swelling of the sheath, penis, and abdomen._--This occurs in certain\r\nunhealthy states of the system, in unhealthful seasons, as the result of\r\noperating without cleansing the sheath and penis, or of keeping the\r\nsubject in a filthy, impure building, as the result of infecting the\r\nwound by hands or instruments bearing septic bacteria, or as the result\r\nof premature closure of the wound, and imprisonment of matter.\r\n\r\nPure air and cleanliness of groin and wound are to be obtained.\r\nAntiseptics, like the mercuric-chlorid lotion (1 part to 2,000) are to\r\nbe applied to the parts; the wound, if closed, is to be opened anew, any\r\naccumulated matter or blood washed out, and the antiseptic liquid freely\r\napplied. The most tense or dependent parts of the swelling in sheath or\r\npenis, or beneath the belly, should be pricked at intervals of 3 or 4\r\ninches to a depth of half an inch, and antiseptics freely applied to the\r\nsurface. Fomentations with warm water may also be used to favor oozing\r\nfrom the incisions and to encourage the formation of white matter in the\r\noriginal wounds, which must not be allowed to close again at once. A\r\nfree, creamlike discharge implies a healthy action in the sore, and is\r\nthe precursor of recovery.\r\n\r\n_Phymosis and paraphymosis._--In cases of swelling, as above, the penis\r\nmay be imprisoned within the sheath (phymosis) or protruded and swollen\r\nso that it can not be retracted into it (paraphymosis). In these cases\r\nthe treatment indicated above, and especially the scarifications, will\r\nprove a useful preliminary resort. The use of astringent lotions is\r\nalways desirable, and in case of the protruded penis the application of\r\nan elastic or simple linen bandage, so as to press the blood and\r\naccumulated fluid out, will enable the operator to return it.\r\n\r\n_Tumors on the spermatic cord._--These are due to rough handling or\r\ndragging upon the cord in castration, to strangulation of unduly long\r\ncords in the external wound, to adhesion of the end of the cord to the\r\nskin, to inflammation of the cord succeeding exposure to cold or wet, or\r\nto the presence of infection (_Staphylococcus botriomyces_). These\r\ntumors give rise to a stiff, straddling gait, and may be felt as hard\r\nmasses in the groin connected above with the cord. They may continue to\r\ngrow slowly for many years until they reach a weight of 15 or 20 pounds,\r\nand contract adhesions to all surrounding parts. If disconnected from\r\nthe skin and inguinal canal they may be removed in the same manner as\r\nthe testicle, while if larger and firmly adherent to the skin and\r\nsurrounding parts generally, they must be carefully dissected from the\r\nparts, the arteries being tied as they are reached and the cord finally\r\ntorn through with an ecraseur. When the cord has become swollen and\r\nindurated up into the abdomen such removal is impossible, though a\r\npartial destruction of the mass may still be attempted by passing\r\nwhite-hot, pointed irons upward toward the inguinal ring in the center\r\nof the thickened and indurated cord.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTRATION BY THE COVERED OPERATION.\r\n\r\nThis is only required in case of hernia or protrusion of bowels or\r\nomentum into the sac of the scrotum, and consists in the return of the\r\nhernia and the application of the caustic clamps over the cord and inner\r\nwalls of the inguinal canal, so that the walls of the latter become\r\nadherent above the clamps, the canal is obliterated, and further\r\nprotrusion is hindered. For the full description of this and of the\r\noperation for hernia for geldings, see remarks on hernia.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTRATION OF THE MARE.\r\n\r\nCastration is a much more dangerous operation in the mare than in the\r\nfemales of other domesticated quadrupeds and should never be resorted to\r\nexcept in animals that become unmanageable on the recurrence of heat and\r\nthat will not breed or that are utterly unsuited to breeding. Formerly\r\nthe operation was extensively practiced in Europe, the incision being\r\nmade through the flank, and a large proportion of the subjects perished.\r\nBy operating through the vagina the risk can be largely obviated, as the\r\ndanger of unhealthy inflammation in the wound is greatly lessened. The\r\nanimal should be fixed in a trevis, with each foot fixed to a post and a\r\nsling placed under the body, or it may be thrown and put under\r\nchloroform. The manual operation demands special professional knowledge\r\nand skill, but it consists essentially in making an opening through the\r\nroof of the vagina just above the neck of the womb, then following with\r\nthe hand each horn of the womb until the ovary on that side is reached\r\nand grasped between the lips of forceps and twisted off. It might be\r\ntorn off by an ecraseur especially constructed for the purpose. The\r\nstraining that follows the operation may be checked by ounce doses of\r\nlaudanum, and any risk of protrusion of the bowels may be obviated by\r\napplying the truss advised to prevent eversion of the womb. To further\r\nprevent the pressure of the abdominal contents against the vaginal wound\r\nthe mare should be tied short and high for twenty-four or forty-eight\r\nhours, after which I have found it best to remove the truss and allow\r\nthe privilege of lying down. Another important point is to give bran\r\nmashes and other laxative diet only, and in moderate quantity, for a\r\nfortnight, and to unload the rectum by copious injections of warm water\r\nin case impaction is imminent.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTERILITY.\r\n\r\nSterility may be in the male or in the female. If due to the stallion,\r\nthen all the mares put to him remain barren; if the fault is in the\r\nmare, she alone fails to conceive, while other mares served by the same\r\nstallion get in foal.\r\n\r\nIn the stallion sterility may be due to the following causes: (a)\r\nImperfect development of the testicles, as in cases in which they are\r\nretained within the abdomen; (b) inflammation of the testicles,\r\nresulting in induration; (c) fatty degeneration of the testicles, in\r\nstallions liberally fed on starchy feed and not sufficiently exercised;\r\n(d) fatty degeneration of the excretory ducts of the testicles (_vasa\r\ndeferentia_); (e) inflammation or ulceration of these ducts; (f)\r\ninflammation or ulceration of the mucous membrane covering the penis;\r\n(g) injuries to the penis from blows (often causing paralysis); (h)\r\nwarty growths on the end of the penis; (i) tumors of other kinds\r\n(largely pigmentary), affecting the testicles or penis; (j) nervous\r\ndiseases which abolish the sexual appetite or that control the muscles\r\nwhich are essential to the act of coition; (k) azoturia with resulting\r\nweakness or paralysis of the muscles of the loins or the front of the\r\nthigh (above the stifle); (l) ossification (_anchylosis_) of the\r\njoints of the back or loins, which render the animal unable to rear or\r\nmount; (m) spavins, ringbones, or other painful affections of the hind\r\nlimbs, the pain of which in mounting causes the animal to suddenly stop\r\nshort in the act. In the first three of these only (a, b, and c)\r\nis there real sterility in the sense of the nondevelopment or imperfect\r\ndevelopment of the male vivifying element (spermatozoa). In the other\r\nexamples the secretion may be imperfect in kind and amount, but as\r\ncopulation is prevented it can not reach and impregnate the ovum.\r\n\r\nIn the mare barrenness is equally due to a variety of causes. In a\r\nnumber of breeding studs the proportion of sterile mares has varied from\r\n20 to 40 per cent. It may be due to: (a) Imperfect development of the\r\novary and nonmaturation of ova; (b) cystic or other tumors of the\r\novary; (c) fatty degeneration of the ovary in very obese, pampered\r\nmares; (d) fatty degeneration of the excretory tubes of the ovaries\r\n(Fallopian tubes); (e) catarrh of the womb, with mucopurulent\r\ndischarge; (f) irritable condition of the womb, with profuse\r\nsecretion, straining, and ejection of the semen; (g) nervous\r\nirritability, leading to the same expulsion of the male element; (h)\r\nhigh condition (plethora), with profuse secretion and excitement; (i)\r\nlow condition, with imperfect maturation of the ova and lack of sexual\r\ndesire; (j) poor feeding, overwork, and chronic debilitating diseases,\r\nas leading to the condition just named; (k) closure of the neck of the\r\nwomb, temporarily by spasm or permanently by inflammation and\r\ninduration; (l) closure of the entrance to the vagina through\r\nimperforate hymen, a rare, though not unknown, condition in the mare;\r\n(m) acquired indisposition to breed, seen in old, hard-worked mares\r\nwhich are first put to the stallion when aged; (n) change of climate\r\nhas repeatedly been followed by barrenness; (o) hybridity, which in\r\nmale and female alike usually entails sterility.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment of the majority of these conditions will be\r\nfound dealt with in other parts of this work, so that it is only\r\nnecessary here to name them as causes. Some, however, must be specially\r\nreferred to in this place. Stallions with undescended testicles are\r\nbeyond the reach of medicine, and should be castrated and devoted to\r\nother uses. Indurated testicles may sometimes be remedied in the early\r\nstages by smearing with a weak iodin ointment daily for a length of\r\ntime, and at the same time invigorating the system by liberal feeding\r\nand judicious work. Fatty degeneration is best met by an albuminoid diet\r\n(wheat bran, cottonseed meal, rape cake) and constant, well-regulated\r\nwork. Saccharine, starchy, and fatty food (potatoes, wheat, corn, etc.)\r\nare to be specially avoided. In the mare one diseased and irritable\r\novary should be removed, to do away with the resulting excitability of\r\nthe remainder of the generative organs. An irritable womb, with frequent\r\nstraining and the ejection of a profuse secretion, may sometimes be\r\ncorrected by a restricted diet and full but well-regulated work. Even\r\nfatigue will act beneficially in some such cases, hence the practice of\r\nthe Arab riding his mare to exhaustion just before service. The\r\nperspiration in such case, like the action of a purgative or the\r\nabstraction of blood just before service, benefits, by rendering the\r\nblood vessels less full, by lessening secretion in the womb and\r\nelsewhere, and thus counteracting the tendency to the ejection and loss\r\nof semen. If these means are ineffectual, a full dose of camphor (2\r\ndrams) or of salicin may at times assist. Low condition and anemia\r\ndemand just the opposite kind of treatment--rich, nourishing, albuminoid\r\nfeed, bitter tonics (gentian), sunshine, gentle exercise, liberal\r\ngrooming, and supporting treatment generally are here in order.\r\n\r\nSpasmodic closure of the neck of the womb is common and is easily\r\nremedied in the mare by dilatation with the fingers. The hand, smeared\r\nwith belladonna ointment and with the fingers drawn into the form of a\r\ncone, is introduced through the vagina until the projecting, rounded\r\nneck of the womb is felt at its anterior end. This is opened by the\r\ncareful insertion of one finger at a time, until the fingers have been\r\npassed through the constricted neck into the open cavity of the womb.\r\nThe introduction is made with a gentle, rotary motion, and all\r\nprecipitate violence is avoided, as abrasion, laceration, or other cause\r\nof irritation is likely to interfere with the retention of the semen and\r\nconsequently with impregnation. If the neck of the womb is rigid and\r\nunyielding from the induration which follows inflammation--a rare\r\ncondition in the mare, though common in the cow--more force will be\r\nrequisite, and it may even be needful to incise the neck to the depth of\r\none-sixth of an inch in four or more opposite directions prior to\r\nforcible dilatation. The incision may be made with a probe-pointed\r\nknife, and should be done by a professional man if possible. The\r\nsubsequent dilatation may be best effected by the slow expansion of\r\nsponge or seaweed tents inserted into the narrow canal. In such cases it\r\nis best to let the wounds of the neck heal before putting to horse. An\r\nimperforate hymen may be freely incised in a crucial manner until the\r\npassage will admit the human hand. An ordinary knife may be used for\r\nthis purpose, and after the operation the stallion may be admitted at\r\nonce or only after the wounds have healed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREGNANCY.\r\n\r\nINDICATIONS OF PREGNANCY.\r\n\r\nAs the mere fact of service by the stallion does not insure pregnancy,\r\nit is important that the result should be determined to save the mare\r\nfrom unnecessary and dangerous work or medication when actually in foal\r\nand to obviate wasteful and needless precautions when she is not.\r\n\r\nThe cessation and nonrecurrence of the symptoms of heat (horsing) are\r\nmost significant, though not an infallible, sign of conception. If the\r\nsexual excitement speedily subsides and the mare persistently refuses\r\nthe stallion for a month, she is probably pregnant. In very exceptional\r\ncases a mare, though pregnant, will accept a second or third service\r\nafter weeks or months, and some mares will refuse the horse\r\npersistently, though conception has not taken place, and this in spite\r\nof warm weather, good condition of the mare, and liberal feeding. The\r\nrecurrence of heat in the pregnant mare is most liable to take place in\r\nhot weather. If heat merely persists an undue length of time after\r\nservice, or if it reappears shortly after, in warm weather and in a\r\ncomparatively idle mare, on good feeding, it is less significant, while\r\nthe persistent absence of heat under such conditions may be usually\r\naccepted as proof of conception.\r\n\r\nAn unwonted gentleness and docility on the part of a previously\r\nirritable or vicious mare, and supervening on service, is an excellent\r\nindication of pregnancy, the generative instinct which caused the\r\nexcitement having been satisfied.\r\n\r\nAn increase of fat, with softness and flabbiness of muscle, a loss of\r\nenergy, indisposition for active work, a manifestation of laziness,\r\nindeed, and of fatigue early and easily induced, when preceded by\r\nservice, will usually imply conception.\r\n\r\nEnlargement of the abdomen, especially in its lower third, with slight\r\nfalling in beneath the loins and hollowness of the back are significant\r\nsymptoms, though they may be entirely absent. Swelling and firmness of\r\nthe udder, with the smoothing out of its wrinkles, is a suggestive sign,\r\neven though it appears only at intervals during gestation.\r\n\r\nA steady increase in weight (1-1/2 pounds daily) about the fourth or\r\nfifth month is a useful indication of pregnancy. So is a swollen and red\r\nor bluish-red appearance of the vaginal mucous membrane.\r\n\r\nFrom the seventh or eighth month onward the foal may be felt by the hand\r\n(palm or knuckles) pressed into the abdomen in front of the left stifle.\r\nThe sudden push displaces the foal toward the opposite side of the womb,\r\nand as it floats back its hard body is felt to strike against the hand.\r\nIf the pressure is maintained the movements of the live foal are felt,\r\nand especially in the morning and after a drink of cold water or during\r\nfeeding. A drink of cold water will often stimulate the fetus to\r\nmovements that may be seen by the eye, but an excess of iced water may\r\nprove injurious, even to the causing of abortion. Cold water dashed on\r\nthe belly has a similar effect on the fetus and is equally provocative\r\nof abortion.\r\n\r\nExamination of the uterus with the oiled hand introduced into the rectum\r\nis still more satisfactory, and, if cautiously conducted, no more\r\ndangerous. The rectum must be first emptied and then the hand carried\r\nforward until it reaches the front edge of the pelvic bones below, and\r\npressed downward to ascertain the size and outline of the womb. In the\r\nunimpregnated state the vagina and womb can be felt as a single rounded\r\ntube, dividing in front to two smaller tubes (the horns of the womb). In\r\nthe pregnant mare not only the body of the womb is enlarged, but still\r\nmore so one of the horns (right or left), and on compression the latter\r\nis found to contain a hard, nodular body, floating in a liquid, which in\r\nthe latter half of gestation may be stimulated by gentle pressure to\r\nmanifest spontaneous movements. By this method the presence of the fetus\r\nmay be determined as early as the third month. If the complete, natural\r\noutline of the virgin womb can not be made out, careful examination\r\nshould always be made on the right and left side for the enlarged horn\r\nand its living contents. Should there still be difficulty the mare\r\nshould be placed on an inclined plane, with her hind parts lowest, and\r\ntwo assistants, standing on opposite sides of the body, should raise the\r\nlower part of the abdomen by a sheet passed beneath it. Finally the ear\r\nor stethoscope applied on the wall of the abdomen in front of the stifle\r\nmay detect the beating of the fetal heart (one hundred and twenty-five a\r\nminute) and a blowing sound (the uterine sough), much less rapid and\r\ncorresponding to the number of the pulse of the dam. It is heard most\r\nsatisfactorily after the sixth or eighth month and in the absence of\r\nactive rumbling of the bowels of the dam.\r\n\r\n\r\nDURATION OF PREGNANCY.\r\n\r\nMares usually go about eleven months with young, though first\r\npregnancies often last a year. Foals have lived when born at the three\r\nhundredth day, so with others carried till the four hundredth day. With\r\nthe longer pregnancies there is a greater probability of male offspring.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYGIENE OF THE PREGNANT MARE.\r\n\r\nThe pregnant mare should not be exposed to teasing by a young and ardent\r\nstallion, nor should she be overworked or fatigued, particularly under\r\nthe saddle or on uneven ground. Yet exercise is beneficial to both\r\nmother and offspring, and in the absence of moderate work the breeding\r\nmare should be kept in a lot where she can take exercise at will.\r\n\r\nThe feed should be liberal, but not fattening--oats, bran, sound hay,\r\nand other feeds rich in the principles which form flesh and bone being\r\nespecially indicated. All aliments that tend to indigestion are to be\r\nespecially avoided. Thus rank, aqueous, rapidly growing grasses and\r\nother green feed, partially ripe rye grass, millet, Hungarian grass,\r\nvetches, peas, beans, or maize are objectionable, as is overripe,\r\nfibrous, innutritious hay, or that which has been injured and rendered\r\nmusty by wet, or that which is infested with smut or ergot. Feed that\r\ntends to costiveness should be avoided. Water given often, and at a\r\ntemperature considerable above freezing, will avoid the dangers of\r\nindigestion and abortion which result from taking too much ice-cold\r\nwater at one time. Very cold or frozen feed is objectionable in the same\r\nsense. Severe surgical operations and medicines that act violently on\r\nthe womb, bowels, or kidneys are to be avoided as being liable to cause\r\nabortion. Constipation should be corrected, if possible, by bran mashes,\r\ncarrots, or beets, seconded by exercise, and if a medicinal laxative is\r\nrequired it should be olive oil or other equally bland agent.\r\n\r\nThe stall of the pregnant mare should not be too narrow, so as to cramp\r\nher when lying down or to entail violent effort in getting up, and it\r\nshould not slope too much from the front backward, as this throws the\r\nweight of the uterus back on the pelvis and endangers protrusions and\r\neven abortion. Violent mental impressions are to be avoided, for though\r\nmost mares are not affected thereby, yet a certain number are so\r\nprofoundly impressed that peculiarities and distortions are entailed on\r\nthe offspring; hence, there is wisdom shown in banishing particolored or\r\nobjectionably tinted animals, and those that show deformities or faulty\r\nconformation. Hence, too, the importance of preventing prolonged, acute\r\nsuffering by the pregnant mare, as certain troubles of the eyes, feet,\r\nand joints in the foals have been clearly traced to the concentration\r\nof the mother's mind on corresponding injured organs in herself. Sire\r\nand dam alike tend to reproduce their individual defects which\r\npredispose to disease, but the dam is far more liable to perpetuate the\r\nevil in her progeny which was carried while she was individually\r\nenduring severe suffering caused by such defects. Hence, an active bone\r\nspavin or ringbone, causing lameness, is more objectionable than that in\r\nwhich the inflammation and lameness have both passed, and an active\r\nophthalmia is more to be feared than even an old cataract. For this\r\nreason all active diseases in the breeding mare should be soothed and\r\nabated as early as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRA-UTERINE GESTATION.\r\n\r\nIt is rare in the domestic animals to find the fetus developed elsewhere\r\nthan in the womb. The exceptional forms are those in which the sperm of\r\nthe male, making its way through the womb and Fallopian tubes,\r\nimpregnates the ovum prior to its escape, and in which the now vitalized\r\nand growing ovum, by reason of its gradually increasing size, becomes\r\nimprisoned and fails to escape into the womb. The arrest of the ovum may\r\nbe in the substance of the ovary itself (ovarian pregnancy), in the\r\nFallopian tube (tubal pregnancy), or when by its continuous enlargement\r\nit has ruptured its envelopes so that it escapes into the cavity of the\r\nabdomen, it may become attached to any part of the serous membrane and\r\ndraw its nourishment directly from that (abdominal pregnancy). In all\r\nsuch cases there is an increase and enlargement of the capillary blood\r\nvessels at the point to which the embryo has attached itself so as to\r\nfurnish the needful nutriment for the growing offspring.\r\n\r\nAll appreciable symptoms are absent, unless from the death of the fetus,\r\nor its interference with normal functions, general disorder and\r\nindications of parturition supervene. If these occur later than the\r\nnatural time for parturition, they are the more significant. There may\r\nbe general malaise, loss of appetite, elevated temperature, accelerated\r\npulse, with or without distinct labor pains. Examination with the oiled\r\nhand in the rectum will reveal the womb of the natural, unimpregnated\r\nsize and shape and with both horns of one size. Further exploration may\r\ndetect an elastic mass apart from the womb, in the interior of which may\r\nbe felt the characteristic solid body of the fetus. If the latter is\r\nstill alive and can be stimulated to move, the evidence is even more\r\nperfect. The fetus may die and be carried for years, its soft structures\r\nbecoming absorbed so as to leave only the bones, or by pressure it may\r\nform a fistulous opening through the abdominal walls, or less frequently\r\nthrough the vagina or rectum. In the latter cases the best course is to\r\nfavor the expulsion of the foal and to wash out the resulting cavity\r\nwith a solution of carbolic acid 1 part to water 50 parts. This may be\r\nrepeated daily. When there is no spontaneous opening it is injudicious\r\nto interfere, as the danger from the retention of the fetus is less than\r\nthat from septic fermentation in the enormous fetal sac when that has\r\nbeen opened to the air.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOLES, OR ANIDIAN MONSTERS.\r\n\r\nThese are evidently products of conception, in which the impregnated\r\novum has failed to develop naturally, and presents only a chaotic mass\r\nof skin, hair, bones, muscles, etc., attached to the inner surface of\r\nthe womb by an umbilical cord, which is itself often shriveled and\r\nwasted. They are usually accompanied with a well-developed fetus, so\r\nthat the mole may be looked upon as a twin which has undergone arrest\r\nand vitiation of development. They are expelled by the ordinary process\r\nof parturition, and usually at the same time with the normally developed\r\noffspring.\r\n\r\n\r\nCYSTIC DISEASE OF THE WALLS OF THE WOMB, OR VESICULAR MOLE.\r\n\r\nThis condition appears to be attributable to hypertrophy (enlargement)\r\nof the villi on the inner surface of the womb, which become greatly\r\nincreased in number and hollowed out internally into a series of cysts,\r\nor pouches, containing liquid. Unlike the true mole, therefore, they\r\nappear to be disease of the maternal structure of the womb rather than\r\nof the product of conception. Rodet, in a case of this kind, which had\r\nproduced active labor pains, quieted the disorder with anodynes and\r\neffected a recovery. When this can not be done, attempts may be made to\r\nremove the mass with the ecraseur or otherwise, following it up with\r\nantiseptic injections, as advised under the last heading.\r\n\r\n\r\nDROPSY OF THE WOMB.\r\n\r\nThis appears as a result of some disease of the walls of the womb, but\r\nhas been frequently observed as the result of infection after sexual\r\ncongress, and has, therefore, been confounded with pregnancy. The\r\nsymptoms are those of pregnancy, but without any movements of the fetus\r\nand without the detection of any solid body in the womb when examined\r\nwith the oiled hand in the rectum. At the end of four or eight months\r\nthere are signs of parturition or of frequent straining to pass urine,\r\nand after a time the liquid is discharged clear and watery, or muddy,\r\nthick, and fetid. The hand introduced into the womb can detect neither\r\nfetus nor fetal membrane. If the neck of the womb closes, the liquid may\r\naccumulate a second time, or even a third, if no means are taken to\r\ndisinfect it or to correct the tendency. The best resort is to remove\r\nany diseased product that may be found attached to the walls of the womb\r\nand to inject it daily with a warm solution of carbolic acid 2 drams,\r\nchlorid of zinc one-half dram, water 1 quart. A course of bitter tonics\r\n(gentian 2 drams, sulphate of iron 2 drams, daily) should be given, and\r\na nutritious, easily digested, and slightly laxative diet allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDROPSY OF THE AMNION.\r\n\r\nThis differs from simple dropsy of the womb in that the fluid collects\r\nin the inner of the two water bags (that in which the foal floats) and\r\nnot in the otherwise void cavity of the womb. This affection can occur\r\nonly in the pregnant animal, while dropsy of the womb occurs in the\r\nunimpregnated. The blood of the pregnant mare contains an excess of\r\nwater and a smaller proportion of albumen and red globules, and when\r\nthis condition is still further aggravated by poor feeding and other\r\nunhygienic conditions there is developed the tendency to liquid\r\ntransudation from the vessels and dropsy. As the watery condition of the\r\nblood increases with advancing pregnancy, so dropsy of the amnion is a\r\ndisease of the last four or five months of gestation. The abdomen is\r\nlarge and pendulous, and the swelling fluctuates under pressure, though\r\nthe solid body of the fetus can still be felt to strike against the hand\r\npressed into the swelling. If the hand is introduced into the vagina,\r\nthe womb is found to be tense and round, with the projecting rounded\r\nneck effaced, while the hand in the rectum will detect the rounded,\r\nswollen mass of the womb so firm and tense that the body of the fetus\r\ncan not be felt within it. The mare moves weakly and unsteadily on her\r\nlimbs, having difficulty in supporting the great weight, and in bad\r\ncases there may be loss of appetite, stocking (dropsy) of the hind\r\nlimbs, difficult breathing, and colicky pains. The tension may lead to\r\nabortion, or a slow, laborious parturition may occur at the usual time.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ consists in relieving the tension and accumulation by\r\npuncturing the fetal membrane with a cannula and trocar introduced\r\nthrough the neck of the womb and the withdrawal of the trocar so as to\r\nleave the cannula in situ, or the membranes may be punctured with the\r\nfinger and the excess of liquid allowed to escape. This may bring on\r\nabortion, or the womb may close and gestation continue to the full term.\r\nA course of tonics (gentian root 2 drams, sulphate of iron 2 drams,\r\ndaily) will do much to fortify the system and counteract further\r\nexcessive effusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nDROPSY OF THE LIMBS, PERINEUM, AND ABDOMEN.\r\n\r\nThe disposition to dropsy often shows itself in the hind and even in the\r\nfore limbs, around and beneath the vulva (perineum), and beneath the\r\nabdomen and chest. The affected parts are swollen and pit on pressure,\r\nbut are not especially tender, and subside more or less perfectly under\r\nexercise, hand rubbing, and bandages. In obstinate cases rubbing with\r\nthe following liniment may be resorted to: Compound tincture of iodin,\r\n2 ounces; tannic acid, one-half dram; water, 10 ounces. It does not last\r\nmore than a day or two after parturition.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRAMPS OF THE HIND LIMBS.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of the distended womb on the nerves and blood vessels of\r\nthe pelvis, besides conducing to dropsy, occasionally causes cramps of\r\nthe hind limbs. The limb is raised without flexing the joints, the front\r\nof the hoof being directed toward the ground, or, the spasms occurring\r\nintermittently, the foot is kicked violently against the ground several\r\ntimes in rapid succession. The muscles are felt to be firm and rigid.\r\nThe cramp may be promptly relieved by active rubbing or by walking the\r\nanimal about, and it does not reappear after parturition.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTIPATION.\r\n\r\nThis may result from compression by gravid womb, and is best corrected\r\nby a graduated allowance of boiled flaxseed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARALYSIS.\r\n\r\nThe pressure on the nerves of the pelvis is liable to cause paralysis of\r\nthe hind limbs or of the nerve of sight. These are obstinate until after\r\nparturition, when they recover spontaneously, or under a course of nux\r\nvomica and (local) stimulating liniments.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROLONGED RETENTION OF THE FETUS (FOAL).\r\n\r\nThough far less frequently than in the case of the cow, parturition may\r\nnot be completed at term, and the mare, to her serious and even fatal\r\ninjury, may carry the foal in the womb for a number of months. Hamon\r\nrecords one case in which the mare died after carrying the fetus for 17\r\nmonths, and Caillier a similar result after it had been carried 22\r\nmonths. In these cases the fetus retained its natural form, but in one\r\nreported by Gohier the bones only were left in the womb amid a mass of\r\napparently purulent matter.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--The cause may be any effective obstruction to the act of\r\nparturition, such as lack of contractile power in the womb, unduly\r\nstrong (inflammatory) adhesions between the womb and the fetal\r\nmembranes, wrong presentation of the fetus, contracted pelvis (from\r\nfracture or disease of the bones), or disease and induration of the neck\r\nof the womb.\r\n\r\nThe mere prolongation of gestation does not necessarily entail the death\r\nof the foal; hence the latter has been born alive at the four hundredth\r\nday. Even when the foal has perished putrefaction does not set in unless\r\nthe membranes (water bags) have been ruptured and septic bacteria have\r\nbeen admitted to the interior of the womb. In the latter case a fetid\r\ndecomposition advances rapidly, and the mare usually perishes from\r\npoisoning with the putrid matters absorbed.\r\n\r\nAt the natural period of parturition preparations are apparently made\r\nfor that act. The vulva swells and discharges much mucus, the udder\r\nenlarges, the belly becomes more pendent, and the animal strains more or\r\nless. No progress is made, however; there is not even opening of the\r\nneck of the womb, and after a time the symptoms subside. The mare\r\nusually refuses the male, yet there are exceptions to this rule. If the\r\nneck of the womb has been opened and putrefying changes in its contents\r\nhave set in, the mare loses appetite and condition, pines, discharges an\r\noffensive matter from the generative passages, and dies of inflammation\r\nof the womb and putrid infection. In other cases there is a slow wearing\r\nout of the strength, and she finally dies of exhaustion.\r\n\r\nThe treatment is such as will facilitate the expulsion of the fetus and\r\nits membranes and the subsequent washing out of the womb with\r\ndisinfectants. So long as the mouth of the womb is closed time should be\r\nallowed for its natural dilatation, but if this does not come about\r\nafter a day or two of straining, the opening may be smeared with extract\r\nof belladonna, and the oiled hand, with the fingers and thumb drawn into\r\nthe form of a cone, may be inserted by slow oscillating movements into\r\nthe interior of the womb. The water bags may now be ruptured, any\r\nmalpresentation rectified (see \"Difficult parturition\"), and delivery\r\neffected. After removal of the membranes wash out the womb first with\r\ntepid water and then with a solution of 2 ounces of borax in half a\r\ngallon of water.\r\n\r\nThis injection may have to be repeated if a discharge sets in. The same\r\ncourse may be pursued even after prolonged retention. If the soft parts\r\nof the fetus have been absorbed and the bones only left, these must be\r\ncarefully sought for and removed, and subsequent daily injections will\r\nbe required for some time. In such cases, too, a course of iron tonics\r\n(sulphate of iron, 2 drams daily) will be highly beneficial in restoring\r\nhealth and vigor.\r\n\r\n\r\nABORTION.\r\n\r\nAbortion is, strictly speaking, the expulsion of the impregnated ovum at\r\nany period from the date of impregnation until the foal can survive out\r\nof the womb. If the foal is advanced enough to live, it is premature\r\nparturition, and in the mare this may occur as early as the tenth month\r\n(three hundredth day).\r\n\r\nThe mare may abort by reason of almost any cause that very profoundly\r\ndisturbs the system; hence, very violent inflammations of important\r\ninternal organs (bowels, kidneys, bladder, lungs) may induce abortion.\r\nProfuse diarrhea, whether occurring from the reckless use of purgatives,\r\nthe consumption of irritants in the feed, or a simple indigestion, is an\r\neffective cause. No less so is acute indigestion with evolution of gas\r\nin the intestines (bloating). The presence of stone in the kidneys,\r\nuterus, bladder, or urethra may induce so much sympathetic disorder in\r\nthe womb as to induce abortion. In exceptional cases wherein mares come\r\nin heat during gestation, service by the stallion may cause abortion.\r\nBlows or pressure on the abdomen, rapid driving or riding of the\r\npregnant mare, especially if she is soft and out of condition from\r\nidleness, the brutal use of the spur or whip, and the jolting and\r\nstraining of travel by rail or boat are prolific causes. Bleeding the\r\npregnant mare, a painful surgical operation, and the throwing and\r\nconstraint resorted to for an operation are other causes. Traveling on\r\nheavy, muddy roads, slips and falls on ice, and jumping must be added.\r\nThe stimulation of the abdominal organs by a full drink of iced water\r\nmay precipitate a miscarriage, as may exposure to a cold rainstorm or a\r\nvery cold night after a warm day. Irritant poisons that act on the\r\nurinary or generative organs, such as Spanish flies, rue, savin, tansy,\r\ncotton-root bark, ergot of rye or other grasses, the smut of maize and\r\nother grain, and various fungi in musty fodder are additional causes.\r\nFrosted or indigestible feed, and, above all, green succulent vegetables\r\nin a frozen state, have proved effective factors, and filthy, stagnant\r\nwater is dangerous. Low condition in the dam and plethora have in\r\nopposite ways caused abortion, and hot, relaxing stables and lack of\r\nexercise strongly conduce to it. The exhaustion of the sire by too\r\nfrequent service, entailing debility of the offspring and disease of the\r\nfetus or of its envelopes, must be recognized as a further cause.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms vary mainly according as the abortion is early or late in\r\npregnancy. In the first month or two of pregnancy the mare may miscarry\r\nwithout observable symptoms, and the fact appears only by her coming in\r\nheat. If more closely observed a small clot of blood may be found behind\r\nher, in which a careful search reveals the rudiments of the foal. If the\r\noccurrence is somewhat later in gestation, there will be some general\r\ndisturbance, loss of appetite, neighing, and straining, and the small\r\nbody of the fetus is expelled, enveloped in its membranes. Abortions\r\nduring the later stages of pregnancy are attended with greater\r\nconstitutional disturbance, and the process resembles normal\r\nparturition, with the aggravation that more effort and straining is\r\nrequisite to force the fetus through the comparatively undilatable mouth\r\nof the womb. There is the swelling of the vulva, with mucus or even\r\nbloody discharge; the abdomen droops, the flanks fall in, the udder\r\nfills, the mare looks at her flanks, paws with the fore feet and kicks\r\nwith the hind, switches the tail, moves around uneasily, lies down and\r\nrises, strains, and, as in natural foaling, expels first mucus and\r\nblood, then the waters, and finally the fetus. This may occupy an hour\r\nor two, or it may be prolonged for a day or more, the symptoms subsiding\r\nfor a time, only to reappear with renewed energy. If there is\r\nmalpresentation of the fetus it will hinder progress until rectified,\r\nas in difficult parturition. Abortion may also be followed by the same\r\naccidents, as flooding, retention of the placenta, and leucorrhea.\r\n\r\nThe most important object in an impending abortion is to recognize it at\r\nas early a stage as possible, so that it may, if possible, be cut short\r\nand prevented. Any general, indefinable illness in a pregnant mare\r\nshould lead to a close examination of the vulva as regards swelling,\r\nvascularity of its mucous membrane, and profuse mucus secretion, and,\r\nabove all, any streak or staining of blood; also the condition of the\r\nudder, if that is congested and swollen. Any such indication, with\r\ncolicky pains, straining, however little, and active movement of the\r\nfetus or entire absence of movement, are suggestive symptoms and should\r\nbe duly counteracted.\r\n\r\nThe changes in the vulva and udder, with a soiled and bloody condition\r\nof the tail, may suggest an abortion already accomplished, and the\r\nexamination with the hand in the vagina may detect the mouth of the womb\r\nsoft and dilatable and the interior of the organ slightly filled with a\r\nbloody liquid.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ should be preventive if possible, and would embrace the\r\navoidance of all causes mentioned, and particularly of such as may seem\r\nto be particularly operative in the particular case. If abortions have\r\nalready occurred in a stud, the especial cause in the matter of feed,\r\nwater, exposure to injuries, overwork, lack of exercise, etc., may often\r\nbe identified and removed. A most important point is to avoid all causes\r\nof constipation, diarrhea, indigestion, bloating, violent purgatives,\r\ndiuretics or other potent medicines, painful operations, and slippery\r\nroads, unless well frosted.\r\n\r\nWhen abortion is imminent, the mare should be placed alone in a roomy,\r\ndark, quiet stall, and have the straining checked by some sedative.\r\nLaudanum is usually at hand and may be given in doses of 1 or 2 ounces,\r\naccording to size, and repeated after two or three hours, and even daily\r\nif necessary. Chloroform or chloral hydrate, 3 drams, may be substituted\r\nif more convenient. These should be given in a pint or quart of water,\r\nto avoid burning the mouth and throat. Or _Viburnum prunifolium_ (black\r\nhaw), 1 ounce, may be given and repeated if necessary to prevent\r\nstraining.\r\n\r\nWhen all measures fail and miscarriage proceeds, all that can be done is\r\nto assist in the removal of the fetus and its membranes, as in ordinary\r\nparturition. As in the case of retention of the fetus, it may be\r\nnecessary after delivery to employ antiseptic injections into the womb\r\nto counteract putrid fermentation. This, however, is less necessary in\r\nthe mare than in the cow, in which the prevalent contagious abortion\r\nmust be counteracted by the persistent local use of antiseptics. After\r\nabortion a careful hygiene is demanded, especially in the matter of pure\r\nair and easily digestible feed. The mare should not be served again for\r\na month or longer, and in no case until after all discharge from the\r\nvulva has ceased.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFECTIOUS ABORTION IN MARES.\r\n\r\nThis disease is discussed in the chapter on \"Infectious Diseases.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTURITION.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS OF PARTURITION.\r\n\r\nAs the period of parturition approaches, the swelling of the udder\r\nbespeaks the coming event, the engorgement in exceptional cases\r\nextending forward on the lower surface of the abdomen and even into the\r\nhind limbs. For about a week a serous fluid oozes from the teat and\r\nconcretes as a yellow, waxlike mass around its orifice. About 24 hours\r\nbefore the birth this gives place to a whitish, milky liquid, which\r\nfalls upon and mats the hairs on the inner sides of the legs. Another\r\nsymptom is enlargement of the vulva, with redness of its lining\r\nmembrane, and the escape of glairy mucus. The belly droops, the flanks\r\nfall in, and the loins may even become depressed. Finally the mare\r\nbecomes uneasy, stops feeding, looks anxious, whisks her tail, and may\r\nlie down and rise again. In many mares this is not repeated, but they\r\nremain down; violent contractions of the abdominal muscles ensue; after\r\ntwo or three pains the water bags appear and burst, followed by the fore\r\nfeet of the foal, with the nose between the knees, and by a few more\r\nthroes the fetus is expelled. In other cases the act is accomplished\r\nstanding. The whole act may not occupy more than 5 or 10 minutes. This,\r\ntogether with the disposition of the mare to avoid observation, renders\r\nthe act one that is rarely seen by the attendants.\r\n\r\nThe navel string, which connects the foal to the membranes, is ruptured\r\nwhen the fetus falls to the ground, or when the mare rises, if she has\r\nbeen down, and the membranes are expelled a few minutes later.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL PRESENTATION.\r\n\r\nWhen there is a single foal, the common and desirable presentation is\r\nwith the fore feet first, the nose between the knees, and with the front\r\nof the hoofs and knees and the forehead directed upward toward the anus,\r\ntail, and croup. (Plate XII, fig. 1.) In this way the natural curvature\r\nof the body of the fetus corresponds to the curve of the womb and\r\ngenital passages, and particularly of the bony pelvis, and the foal\r\npasses with much greater ease than if placed with its back downward\r\ntoward the udder. When there is a twin birth the second foal usually\r\ncomes with its hind feet first, and the backs of the legs, the points of\r\nthe hocks, and the tail and croup are turned upward toward the anus and\r\ntail of the mare. (Plate XII, fig. 2.) In this way, even with a\r\nposterior presentation, the curvature of the body of the foal still\r\ncorresponds to that of the passages, and its expulsion may be quite as\r\neasy as in anterior presentation. Any presentation aside from these two\r\nmay be said to be abnormal and will be considered under \"Difficult\r\nparturition.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPREMATURE LABOR PAINS.\r\n\r\nThese may be brought on by, any violent exertion, use under the saddle,\r\nor in heavy draft, or in rapid paces, or in travel by rail or sea,\r\nblows, kicks, crushing by other animals in a doorway or gate. Excessive\r\naction of purgative or diuretic agents, or of agents that irritate the\r\nbowels or kidneys, like arsenic, paris green, all caustic salts and\r\nacids, and acrid and narcotico-acrid vegetables, is equally injurious.\r\nFinally, the ingestion of agents that stimulate the action of the gravid\r\nwomb (ergot of rye or of other grasses, smut, various fungi of fodders,\r\nrue, savin, cotton root, etc.) may bring on labor pains prematurely.\r\n\r\nBesides the knowledge that parturition is not yet due, there will be\r\nless enlargement, redness, and swelling of the vulva, less mucous\r\ndischarge, less filling of the udder, and fewer appearances of wax and\r\nprobably none of milk from the ends of the teats. The oiled hand\r\nintroduced into the vulva will not enter with the ease usual at full\r\nterm, and the neck of the womb will be felt not only closed, but with\r\nits projecting papillae, through which it is perforated, not yet\r\nflattened down and effaced, as at full term. The symptoms are, indeed,\r\nthose of threatened abortion, but at such an advanced stage of gestation\r\nas is compatible with the survival of the offspring.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment consists in the separation of the mare, in a\r\nquiet, dark, secluded place, from all other animals, and the free use of\r\nantispasmodics and anodynes. Opium in dram doses every two hours, or\r\nlaudanum in ounce doses at similar intervals, will often suffice. When\r\nthe more urgent symptoms have subsided these doses may be repeated\r\nthrice a day till all excitement passes off or until the passages have\r\nbecome relaxed and prepared for parturition. _Viburnum prunifolium_\r\n(black haw), in ounce doses, may be added if necessary. Should\r\nparturition become inevitable, it may be favored and any necessary\r\nassistance furnished.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFICULT PARTURITION.\r\n\r\nWith natural presentation this is a rare occurrence. The great length of\r\nthe fore limbs and face entail, in the anterior presentation, the\r\nformation of a long cone, which dilates and glides through the passages\r\nwith comparative ease. Even with the hind feet first a similar conical\r\nform is presented, and the process is rendered easy and quick.\r\nDifficulty and danger arise mainly from the act being brought on\r\nprematurely before the passages are sufficiently dilated, from narrowing\r\nof the pelvic bones or other mechanical obstruction in the passages,\r\nfrom monstrous distortions or duplications in the fetus, or from the\r\nturning back of one of the members so that the elongated conical or\r\nwedge-shaped outline is done away with. Prompt as is the normal\r\nparturition in the mare, however, difficult and delayed parturitions are\r\nsurrounded by special dangers and require unusual precautions and skill.\r\nFrom the proclivity of the mare to unhealthy inflammations of the\r\nperitoneum and other abdominal organs, penetrating wounds of the womb or\r\nvagina are liable to prove fatal. The contractions of the womb and\r\nabdominal walls are so powerful as to exhaust and benumb the arm of the\r\nassistant and to endanger penetrating wounds of the genital organs. By\r\nreason of the looser connection of the fetal membranes with the womb, as\r\ncompared with those of ruminants, the violent throes early detach these\r\nmembranes throughout their whole extent, and the foal, being thus\r\nseparated from the mother and thrown on its own resources, dies at an\r\nearly stage of any protracted parturition. The foal rarely survives four\r\nhours after the onset of parturient throes. From the great length of the\r\nlimbs and neck of the foal it is extremely difficult to secure and bring\r\nup limb or head which has been turned back when it should have been\r\npresented. When assistance must be rendered, the operator should don a\r\nthick woolen undershirt with the sleeves cut out at the shoulders. This\r\nprotects the body and leaves the whole arm free for manipulation. Before\r\ninserting the arm it should be smeared with lard. This protects the skin\r\nagainst septic infection and favors the introduction of the hand and\r\narm. The hand should be inserted with the thumb and fingers drawn\r\ntogether like a cone. Whether standing or lying, the mare should be\r\nturned with head downhill and hind parts raised as much as possible. The\r\ncontents of the abdomen gravitating forward leave much more room for\r\nmanipulation. Whatever part of the foal is presented (head, foot) should\r\nbe secured with a cord and running noose before it is pushed back to\r\nsearch for the other missing parts. Even if a missing part is reached,\r\nno attempt should be made to bring it up during a labor pain. Pinching\r\nthe back will sometimes check the pains and allow the operator to secure\r\nand bring up the missing member. In intractable cases a large dose of\r\nchloral hydrate (1 ounce in a quart of water) or the inhalation of\r\nchloroform and air (equal proportions) to insensibility may secure a\r\nrespite, during which the missing members may be replaced. If the waters\r\nhave been discharged and the mucus dried up, the genital passages and\r\nbody of the fetus should be lubricated with lard or oil before any\r\nattempt at extraction is made. When the missing member has been brought\r\nup into position and presentation has been rendered natural, traction\r\non the fetus must be made only during a labor pain. If a mare is\r\ninclined to kick, it may be necessary to apply hobbles to protect the\r\noperator.\r\n\r\nDIFFICULT PARTURITION FROM NARROW PELVIS.--A disproportion between the\r\nfetus got by a large stallion and the pelvis of a small dam is a serious\r\nobstacle to parturition, sometimes seen in the mare. This is not the\r\nrule, however, as the foal up to birth usually accommodates itself to\r\nthe size of the dam, as illustrated in the successful crossing of\r\nPercheron stallions on mustang mares. If the disproportion is too great\r\nthe only resort is embryotomy.\r\n\r\nFRACTURED HIP BONES.--More commonly the obstruction comes from\r\ndistortion and narrowing of the pelvis as the result of fractures.\r\n(Plate XIII, fig. 2.) Fractures at any point of the lateral wall or\r\nfloor of the pelvis are repaired with the formation of an extensive bony\r\ndeposit bulging into the passage of the pelvis. The displacement of the\r\nends of the broken bone is another cause of constriction, and between\r\nthe two conditions the passage of the fetus may be rendered impossible\r\nwithout embryotomy. Fracture of the sacrum (the continuation of the\r\nbackbone forming the croup) leads to the depression of the posterior\r\npart of that bone in the roof of the pelvis and the narrowing of the\r\npassage from above downward by a bony ridge presenting its sharp edge\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nIn all cases in which there has been injury to the bones of the pelvis\r\nthe obvious precaution is to withhold the mare from breeding and to use\r\nher for work only.\r\n\r\nIf a mare with a pelvis thus narrowed has got in foal inadvertently,\r\nabortion may be induced in the early months of gestation by slowly\r\nintroducing the oiled finger through the neck of the womb and following\r\nthis by the other fingers until the whole hand has been introduced. Then\r\nthe water bags may be broken, and with the escape of the liquid the womb\r\nwill contract on the solid fetus and labor pains will ensue. The fetus\r\nbeing small will pass easily.\r\n\r\nTUMORS IN THE VAGINA AND PELVIS.--Tumors of various kinds may form in\r\nthe vagina or elsewhere within the pelvis, and when large enough will\r\nobstruct or prevent the passage of the fetus. Gray mares, which are so\r\nsubject to black pigment tumors (melanosis) on the tail, anus, and\r\nvulva, are the most liable to suffer from this. Still more rarely the\r\nwall of the vagina becomes relaxed, and being pressed by a mass of\r\nintestines will protrude through the lips of the vulva as a hernial sac,\r\ncontaining a part of the bowels. If a tumor is small it may only retard\r\nand not absolutely prevent parturition. A hernial protrusion of the wall\r\nof the vagina may be pressed back and emptied, so that the body of the\r\nfetus engaging in the passage may find no further obstacle. When a\r\ntumor is too large to allow delivery the only resort is to remove it,\r\nbut before proceeding it must be clearly made out that the obstruction\r\nis a mass of diseased tissue, and not a sac containing intestines. If\r\nthe tumor hangs by a neck it can usually be most safely removed by the\r\necraseur, the chain being passed around the pedicel and gradually\r\ntightened until that is torn through.\r\n\r\nHERNIA OF THE WOMB.--The rupture of the musculo-fibrous floor of the\r\nbelly and the escape of the gravid womb into a sac formed by the\r\nperitoneum and skin hanging toward the ground is described by all\r\nveterinary obstetricians, yet it is very rarely seen in the mare. The\r\nform of the fetus can be felt through the walls of the sac, so that it\r\nis easy to recognize the condition. Its cause is usually external\r\nviolence, though it may start from an umbilical hernia. When the period\r\nof parturition arrives, the first effort should be to return the fetus\r\nwithin the proper abdominal cavity, and this can sometimes be\r\naccomplished with the aid of a stout blanket gradually tightened around\r\nthe belly. This failing, the mare may be placed on her side or back and\r\ngravitation brought to the aid of manipulation in effecting the return.\r\nEven after the hernia has been reduced the relaxed state of the womb and\r\nabdominal walls may serve to hinder parturition, in which case the oiled\r\nhand must be introduced through the vagina, the fetus brought into\r\nposition, and traction coincident with the labor pains employed to\r\nproduce delivery.\r\n\r\nTWISTING OF THE NECK OF THE WOMB.--This condition is very uncommon in\r\nthe mare, though occasionally seen in the cow, owing to the greater\r\nlaxity of the broad ligaments of the womb in that animal. It consists in\r\na revolution of the womb on its own axis, so that its right or left side\r\nwill be turned upward (quarter revolution), or the lower surface may be\r\nturned upward and the upper surface downward (half revolution). The\r\neffect is to throw the narrow neck of the womb into a series of spiral\r\nfolds, turning in the direction in which the womb has revolved, closing\r\nthe neck and rendering distention and dilatation impossible.\r\n\r\nThe period and pains of parturition arrive, but in spite of continued\r\nefforts no progress is made, neither water bags nor liquids appearing.\r\nThe oiled hand introduced into the closed neck of the womb will readily\r\ndetect the spiral direction of the folds on its inner surface.\r\n\r\nThe method of relief which I have successfully adopted in the cow may be\r\nequally effective in the mare. The dam is placed (with her head uphill)\r\non her right side if the upper folds of the spiral turn toward the\r\nright, and on her left side if they turn toward the left, and the oiled\r\nhand is introduced through the neck of the womb and a limb or other part\r\nof the body of the fetus is seized and pressed against the wall of the\r\nwomb, while two or three assistants turn the animal over on her back\r\ntoward the other side. The object is to keep the womb stationary while\r\nthe animal is rolling. If success attends the effort, the constriction\r\naround the arm is suddenly relaxed, the spiral folds are effaced, and\r\nthe water bags and fetus press forward into the passage. If the first\r\nattempt does not succeed, it may be repeated again and again until\r\nsuccess crowns the effort. Among my occasional causes of failure have\r\nbeen the prior death and decomposition of the fetus, with the\r\nextrication of gas and overdistention of the womb, and the supervention\r\nof inflammation and inflammatory exudation around the neck of the womb,\r\nwhich hinders untwisting. The first of these conditions occurs early in\r\nthe horse from the detachment of the fetal membranes from the wall of\r\nthe womb; and as the mare is more subject to fatal peritonitis than the\r\ncow, it may be concluded that both these sources of failure are more\r\nprobable in the former subject.\r\n\r\nWhen the case is intractable, though the hand may be easily introduced,\r\nthe instrument shown in Plate XIV, figure 7, may be used. Each hole at\r\nthe small end of the instrument has passed through it a stout cord with\r\na running noose, to be passed around two feet or other portion of the\r\nfetus which it may be possible to reach. The cords are then drawn tight\r\nand fixed around the handle of the instrument; then, by using the cross\r\nhandle as a lever, the fetus and womb may be rotated in a direction\r\nopposite to that causing the obstruction. During this process the hand\r\nmust be introduced to feel when the twist has been undone. This method\r\nmay be supplemented, if necessary, by rolling the mare as described\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nEFFUSION OF BLOOD IN THE VAGINAL WALLS.--This is common as a result of\r\ndifficult parturition, but it may occur from local injury before that\r\nact, and may seriously interfere with it. This condition is easily\r\nrecognized by the soft, doughy swelling so characteristic of blood\r\nclots, and by the dark-red color of the mucous membrane. I have laid\r\nopen such swellings with the knife as late as 10 days before\r\nparturition, evacuated the clots, and dressed the wound daily with an\r\nastringent lotion (sulphate of zinc 1 dram, carbolic acid 1 dram, water\r\n1 quart). A similar resort might be had, if necessary, during\r\nparturition.\r\n\r\nCALCULUS (STONE) AND TUMOR IN THE BLADDER.--The pressure upon the\r\nbladder containing a stone or a tumor may prove so painful that the mare\r\nwill voluntarily suppress the labor pains. Examination of the bladder\r\nwith the finger introduced through the urethra will detect the offending\r\nagent. A stone should be extracted with forceps. (See \"Lithotomy.\") The\r\nlarge papillary tumors which I have met with in the mare's bladder have\r\nbeen invariably delicate in texture and could be removed piecemeal by\r\nforceps. Fortunately, mares affected in this way rarely breed.\r\n\r\nFECAL IMPACTION OF THE RECTUM.--In some animals, with more or less\r\nparalysis or weakness of the tail and rectum, the rectum may become so\r\nimpacted with solid feces that the mare is unable to discharge them, and\r\nthe accumulation both by reason of the mechanical obstruction and the\r\npain caused by pressure upon it will impel the animal to cut short all\r\nlabor pains. The rounded swelling surrounding the anus will at once\r\nsuggest the condition, when the obstruction may be removed by the\r\nwell-oiled or well-soaped hand.\r\n\r\nSPASM OF THE NECK OF THE WOMB.--This occurs in the mare of specially\r\nexcitable temperament, or under particular causes of irritation, local\r\nor general. Labor pains, though continuing for some time, produce no\r\ndilatation of the neck of the womb, which will be found firmly closed so\r\nas to admit but one or two fingers; this, although the projection at the\r\nmouth of the womb may have been entirely effaced, so that a simple round\r\nopening is left, with rigid margins.\r\n\r\nThe simplest treatment consists in smearing this part with solid extract\r\nof belladonna, and after an interval inserting the hand with fingers and\r\nthumb drawn into the form of a cone, rupturing the membranes and\r\nbringing the fetus into position for extraction, as advised under\r\n\"Prolonged retention of the fetus.\" Another mode is to insert through\r\nthe neck of the womb an ovoid rubber bag, empty, and furnished with an\r\nelastic tube 12 feet long. Carry the free end of this tube upward to a\r\nheight of 8, 10, or 12 feet, insert a filler into it, and proceed to\r\ndistend the bag with tepid or warm water.\r\n\r\nFIBROUS BANDS CONSTRICTING OR CROSSING THE NECK OF THE WOMB.--These,\r\noccurring as the result of disease, have been several times observed in\r\nthe mare. They may exist in the cavity of the abdomen and compress and\r\nobstruct the neck of the womb, or they may extend from side to side of\r\nthe vagina across and just behind the neck of the womb. In the latter\r\nposition they may be felt and quickly remedied by cutting them across.\r\nIn the abdomen they can be reached only by incision, and two\r\nalternatives are presented: (1) To perform embryotomy and extract the\r\nfetus piecemeal, and (2) to make an incision into the abdomen and\r\nextract by the Caesarean operation, or simply to cut the constricting\r\nband and attempt delivery by the usual channel.\r\n\r\nFIBROUS CONSTRICTION OF VAGINA OR VULVA.--This is probably always the\r\nresult of direct mechanical injury and the formation of rigid cicatrices\r\nwhich fail to dilate with the remainder of the passages at the approach\r\nof parturition. The presentation of the fetus in the natural way and the\r\noccurrence of successive and active labor pains without any favorable\r\nresult will direct attention to the rigid and unyielding cicatrices\r\nwhich may be incised at one, two, or more points to a depth of half an\r\ninch or more, after which the natural expulsive efforts will usually\r\nprove effective. The resulting wounds may be washed frequently with a\r\nsolution of 1 part of carbolic acid to 50 parts of water, or of 1 part\r\nof mercuric chlorid to 1,000 parts of water.\r\n\r\nFETUS ADHERENT TO THE WALLS OF THE WOMB.--In inflammation of the mucous\r\nmembrane lining the cavity of the womb and implicating the fetal\r\nmembranes the resulting embryonic tissue sometimes establishes a medium\r\nof direct continuity between the womb and fetal membranes; the blood\r\nvessels of the one communicate freely with those of the other and the\r\nfibers of the one are prolonged into the other. This causes retention of\r\nthe membranes after birth, and a special risk of bleeding from the womb,\r\nand of septic poisoning. In exceptional cases the adhesion is more\r\nextensive and binds a portion of the body of the foal firmly to the\r\nwomb. In such cases it has repeatedly been found impossible to extract\r\nthe foal until such adhesions were broken down. If they can be reached\r\nwith the hand and recognized, they may be torn through with the fingers\r\nor with a blunt hook, after which delivery may be attempted with hope of\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nEXCESSIVE SIZE OF FETUS.--It would seem that a small mare may usually be\r\nsafely bred to a large stallion, yet this is not always the case; and\r\nwhen the small size is an individual rather than a racial characteristic\r\nor the result of being very young, the rule can not be expected to hold.\r\nThere is always great danger in breeding the young, small, and\r\nundeveloped female, and the dwarfed representative of a larger breed, as\r\nthe offspring tend to partake of the large race characteristics and to\r\nshow them even prior to birth. When impregnation has occurred in the\r\nvery young or in the dwarfed female there are two alternatives--to\r\ninduce abortion or to wait until there are attempts at parturition and\r\nto extract by embryotomy if impracticable otherwise.\r\n\r\nCONSTRICTION OF A MEMBER BY THE NAVEL STRING.--In man and animals alike\r\nthe winding of the umbilical cord around a member of the fetus sometimes\r\nleads to the amputation of the latter. It is also known to get wound\r\naround the neck or a limb at birth, but in the mare this does not\r\nseriously impede parturition, as the loosely attached membranes are\r\neasily separated from the womb and no strangulation or retarding occurs.\r\nThe foal may, however, die from the cessation of the placental\r\ncirculation unless it is speedily delivered.\r\n\r\nWATER IN THE HEAD (HYDROCEPHALUS) OF THE FOAL.--This consists in the\r\nexcessive accumulation of liquid in the ventricles of the brain so that\r\nthe cranial cavity is enlarged and constitutes a great, projecting,\r\nrounded mass occupying the space from the eyes upward. (See Plate XIII,\r\nfig. 3.) With an anterior presentation (fore feet and nose) this\r\npresents an insuperable obstacle to progress, as the diseased cranium is\r\ntoo large to enter the pelvis at the same time with the fore arms. With\r\na posterior presentation (hind feet) all goes well until the body and\r\nshoulders have passed out, when progress is suddenly arrested by the\r\ngreat bulk of the head. In the first case, the oiled hand introduced\r\nalong the face detects the enormous size of the head, which may be\r\ndiminished by puncturing it with a knife or trocar and cannula in the\r\nmedian line, evacuating the water and pressing in the thin, bony walls.\r\nWith a posterior presentation, the same course must be followed; the\r\nhand passed along the neck will detect the cranial swelling, which may\r\nbe punctured with a knife or trocar. Oftentimes with an anterior\r\npresentation the great size of the head leads to its displacement\r\nbackward, and thus the fore limbs alone engage in the passages. Here the\r\nfirst object is to seek and bring up the missing head, and then puncture\r\nit as above suggested.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XII.\r\n\r\nNORMAL PRESENTATIONS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIII.\r\n\r\nSOME FACTORS IN DIFFICULT LABOR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIV.\r\n\r\nINSTRUMENTS USED IN DIFFICULT LABOR.]\r\n\r\nASCITES, OR DROPSY OF THE ABDOMEN IN THE FOAL.--The accumulation of\r\nliquid in the abdominal cavity of the fetus is less frequent, but when\r\npresent it may arrest parturition as completely as will hydrocephalus.\r\nWith an anterior presentation the foal may pass as far as the shoulders,\r\nbut behind this all efforts fail to effect a further advance. With a\r\nposterior presentation the hind legs as far as the thighs may be\r\nexpelled, but at this point all progress ceases. In either case the\r\noiled hand, passed inward by the side of the foal, will detect the\r\nenormous distension of the abdomen and its soft, fluctuating contents.\r\nThe only course is to puncture the cavity and evacuate the liquid. With\r\nthe anterior presentation this may be done with a long trocar and\r\ncannula, introduced through the chest and diaphragm, or with a knife an\r\nincision may be made between the first two ribs and the lungs and heart\r\ncut or torn out, when the diaphragm will be felt projecting strongly\r\nforward, and may be easily punctured. Should there not be room to\r\nintroduce the hand through the chest, the oiled hand may be passed along\r\nbeneath the breast bone and the abdomen punctured. With a posterior\r\npresentation the abdomen must be punctured in the same way, the hand,\r\narmed with a knife protected in its palm, being passed along the side of\r\nthe flank or between the hind limbs. It should be added that moderate\r\ndropsy of the abdomen is not incompatible with natural delivery, the\r\nliquid being at first crowded back into the portion of the belly still\r\nengaged in the womb, and passing slowly from that into the advanced\r\nportion as soon as that has cleared the narrow passage of the pelvis and\r\npassed out where it can expand.\r\n\r\nGENERAL DROPSY OF THE FETUS.--In this case the tissues generally are\r\ndistended with liquid, and the skin is found at all points tense and\r\nrounded, and pitting on pressure with the fingers. In some such cases\r\ndelivery may be effected after the skin has been punctured at narrow\r\nintervals to allow the escape of the fluid and then liberally smeared\r\nwith fresh lard. More commonly, however, it can not be reached at all\r\npoints to be so punctured nor sufficiently reduced to be extracted\r\nwhole, and resort must be had to embryotomy.\r\n\r\nEMPHYSEMA, OR SWELLING OF THE FETUS WITH GAS.--This has been described\r\nas occurring in a living fetus, but I have met with it only in the dead\r\nand decomposing foal after futile efforts had been made for several days\r\nto effect delivery. These cases are very difficult, as the foal is\r\ninflated to such extent that it is impossible to advance it into the\r\npassages, and the skin of the fetus and the walls of the womb and vagina\r\nhave become so dry that it is impracticable to cause the one to glide on\r\nthe other. The hair comes off any part that may be seized, and the case\r\nis rendered the more offensive and dangerous by the very fetid liquids\r\nand gases. The only resort is embryotomy, by which I have succeeded in\r\nsaving a valuable mare that had carried a colt in this condition for\r\nfour days.\r\n\r\nCONTRACTIONS OF MUSCLES.--The foal is not always developed\r\nsymmetrically, but certain groups of muscles are liable to remain short,\r\nor to shorten because of persistent spasmodic contraction, so that even\r\nthe bones become distorted and twisted. This is most common in the neck.\r\nThe bones of this part and even of the face are drawn to one side and\r\nshortened, the head being held firmly to the flank and the jaws being\r\ntwisted to the right or left. In other cases the flexor muscles of the\r\nfore limbs are contracted so that the latter are strongly bent at the\r\nknee. In neither of these cases can the distorted part be extended and\r\nstraightened, so that body or limbs must necessarily present double, and\r\nnatural delivery is rendered impossible. The bent neck may sometimes be\r\nstraightened after the muscles have been cut on the side to which it is\r\nturned, and the bent limbs after the tendons on the back of the shank\r\nbone have been cut across. Failing to accomplish this, the next resort\r\nis embryotomy.\r\n\r\nINCLOSED OVUM, OR TUMORS OF THE FETUS.--Tumors or diseased growths may\r\nform on any part of the foal, internal or external, and by their size\r\nimpede or hinder parturition. In some cases what appears as a tumor is\r\nan imprisoned and undeveloped ovum which has grafted itself on the\r\nfetus. These are usually sacculated, and may contain skin, hair, muscle,\r\nbone, and other natural tissues. The only course to be pursued in such\r\ncases is to excise the tumor, or, if this is not feasible, to perform\r\nembryotomy.\r\n\r\nMONSTROSITIES.--Monstrosity in the foal is an occasional cause of\r\ndifficult parturition, especially such monsters as show excessive\r\ndevelopment of some part of the body, a displacement or distortion of\r\nparts, or a redundancy of parts, as in double monsters. Monsters may be\r\ndivided into--\r\n\r\n(1) Monsters with absence of parts--absence of head, limb, or other\r\norgan.\r\n\r\n(2) Monsters with some part abnormally small--dwarfed head, limb, trunk,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n(3) Monsters through unnatural division of parts--cleft head, trunk,\r\nlimbs, etc.\r\n\r\n(4) Monsters through absence of natural divisions--absence of mouth,\r\nnose, eyes, anus, confluent digits, etc.\r\n\r\n(5) Monsters through fusion of parts--one central eye, one nasal\r\nopening, etc.\r\n\r\n(6) Monsters through abnormal position or form of parts--curved spine,\r\nface, limb, etc.\r\n\r\n(7) Monsters through excess of formation--enormous head, supernumerary\r\ndigits, etc.\r\n\r\n(8) Monsters through imperfect differentiation of sexual\r\norgans--hermaphrodites.\r\n\r\n(9) Double monsters--double-headed, double-bodied, extra limbs, etc.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--The causes of monstrosities appear to be very varied. Some\r\nmonstrosities, like extra digits, absence of horns or tail, etc., run in\r\nfamilies and are produced almost as certainly as color or form. Others\r\nare associated with too close breeding, the powers of symmetrical\r\ndevelopment being interfered with, just as in other cases a sexual\r\nincompatibility is developed, near relatives failing to breed with each\r\nother. Mere arrest of development of a part may arise from accidental\r\ndisease of the embryo; hence vital organs are left out, or portions of\r\norgans, like the dividing walls of the heart, are omitted. Sometimes an\r\nolder fetus is inclosed in the body of another, each having started\r\nindependently from a separate ovum, but the one having become embedded\r\nin the semifluid mass of the other and having developed there\r\nsimultaneously with it, but not so largely nor perfectly. In many cases\r\nof redundance of parts the extra part or member has manifestly developed\r\nfrom the same ovum and nutrient center with the normal member to which\r\nit remains adherent, just as a new tail will grow out in a newt when the\r\nformer has been cut off. In the early embryo, with its great powers of\r\ndevelopment, this factor can operate to far greater purpose than in the\r\nadult animal. Its influence is seen in the fact pointed out by St.\r\nHilaire that such redundant parts are nearly always connected with the\r\ncorresponding portions in the normal fetus. Thus superfluous legs or\r\ndigits are attached to the normal ones, double heads or tails are\r\nconnected to a common neck or rump, and double bodies are attached to\r\neach other by corresponding points, navel to navel, breast to breast,\r\nback to back. All this suggests the development of extra parts from the\r\nsame primary layer of the impregnated and developing ovum. The effect of\r\ndisturbing conditions in giving such wrong directions to the\r\ndevelopmental forces is well shown in the experiments of St. Hilaire and\r\nValentine in varnishing, shaking, and otherwise breaking up the natural\r\nconnections in eggs, and thereby determining the formation of\r\nmonstrosities at will. So, in the mammal, blows and other injuries that\r\ndetach the fetal membranes from the walls of the womb or that modify\r\ntheir circulation by inducing inflammation are at times followed by the\r\ndevelopment of a monster. The excitement, mental and physical, attendant\r\non fright occasionally acts in a similar way, acting probably through\r\nthe same channels.\r\n\r\nThe monstrous forms liable to interfere with parturition are such as,\r\nfrom contracted or twisted limbs or spine, must be presented double;\r\nwhere supernumerary limbs, head, or body must approach the passages with\r\nthe natural ones; where a head or other member has attained to an\r\nunnatural size; where the body of one fetus has become inclosed in or\r\nattached to another, etc.\r\n\r\nExtraction is sometimes possible by straightening the members and\r\nobtaining such a presentation as will reduce the presenting mass to its\r\nsmallest and most wedgelike dimensions. To effect this it may be needful\r\nto cut the flexor tendons of bent limbs or the muscles on the side of a\r\ntwisted neck or body; one or more of the manipulations necessary to\r\nsecure and bring up a missing member may be required. In most cases of\r\nmonstrosity by excess, however, it is needful to remove the superfluous\r\nparts, in which case the general principles employed for embryotomy must\r\nbe followed. The Caesarean section, by which the fetus is extracted\r\nthrough an incision in the walls of the abdomen and womb, is\r\ninadmissible, as it practically entails the sacrifice of the mare, which\r\nshould never be done for the sake of a monster. (See \"Embryotomy,\" p.\r\n202.)\r\n\r\nENTRANCE OF TWINS INTO THE PASSAGE AT ONCE.--Twins are rare in the mare,\r\nand still more rare is the impaction of both at once into the pelvis.\r\nThe condition would be easily recognized by the fact that two fore limbs\r\nand two hind would occupy the passage at once, the front of the hoofs of\r\nthe fore feet being turned upward and those of the hind feet downward.\r\nIf both belonged to one foal, they would be turned in the same\r\ndirection. Once recognized, the condition is easily remedied by passing\r\na rope with a running noose round each foot of the foal that is furthest\r\nadvanced or that promises to be most easily extracted, and to push the\r\nmembers of the other fetus back into the depth of the womb. As soon as\r\nthe one fetus is fully engaged into the passage it will hold its place\r\nand its delivery will proceed in the natural way.\r\n\r\n\r\nABNORMAL PRESENTATIONS.\r\n\r\n(Pls. XV-XVIII.)\r\n\r\nAbnormal presentations may be tabulated as follows:\r\n\r\n                            {               {Incompletely extended.\r\n                            {               {  Flexor tendons shortened.\r\n                            {Fore limbs     {Crossed over the neck.\r\n                            {               {Bent back at the knee.\r\n                            {               {Bent back from the shoulder.\r\n   Anterior presentations:  {\r\n                            {               {Bent downward on the neck.\r\n                            {               {Head and neck turned back\r\n                            {               {  beneath the breast.\r\n                            {Head           {Turned to one side.\r\n                            {               {Turned upward and backward\r\n                            {               {  on the back.\r\n                            {\r\n                            {Hind limbs     Hind feet engaged in the pelvis.\r\n                            {\r\n                            {Transverse     Back of foal to side of pelvis.\r\n                            {\r\n                            {Inverted       Back of foal to floor of pelvis.\r\n\r\n                            {Hind limbs     {Bent on itself at the hock.\r\n   Posterior presentations  {               {Bent at the hip.\r\n                            {\r\n                            {Transverse      Back of foal to side of pelvis.\r\n                            {\r\n                            {Inverted        Back of foal to floor of pelvis.\r\n\r\n                                            {With back and loins presented.\r\n   Transverse presentation of body          {With breast and belly presented.\r\n\r\nFORE LIMBS INCOMPLETELY EXTENDED.--In cases of this kind, not only are\r\nthe back tendons behind the knee and shank bone unduly short, but the\r\nsinew extending from the front of the shoulder blade over the front of\r\nthe elbow and down to the head of the shank bone is also shortened. The\r\nresult is that the fore limb is bent at the knee and the elbow is also\r\nrigidly bent. The condition obstructs parturition by the feet becoming\r\npressed against the floor of the pelvis or by the elbow pressing on its\r\nanterior brim. Relief is to be obtained by forcible extension. A rope\r\nwith a running noose is passed around each fetlock and a repeller (see\r\nPlate XIV) planted in the breast is pressed in a direction upward and\r\nbackward while active traction is made on the ropes. If the feet are not\r\nthereby raised from the floor of the pelvis the palm of the hand may be\r\nplaced beneath them to protect the mucous membrane until they have\r\nadvanced sufficiently to obviate this danger. In the absence of a\r\nrepeller, a smooth rounded fork handle may be employed. If the\r\nshortening is too great to allow of the extension of the limbs in this\r\nway, the tense tendons may be cut across behind the shank bone and in\r\nfront of the elbow, and the limb will be easily straightened out. This\r\nis most easily done with an embryotomy knife furnished with a ring for\r\nthe middle finger, so that the blade may be protected in the palm of the\r\nhand. (See Plate XIII, fig. 4.)\r\n\r\nFORE LIMB CROSSED OVER BACK OF NECK.--With the long fore limbs of the\r\nfoal this readily occurs, and the resulting increase in thickness, both\r\nat the head and shoulder, offers a serious obstacle to progress. (See\r\nPlate XV, fig. 2.) The hand introduced into the passage detects the head\r\nand one fore foot, and farther back on the same side of the head the\r\nsecond foot, from which the limb may be traced obliquely across the back\r\nof the neck.\r\n\r\nIf parturition continues to make progress the displaced foot may bruise\r\nand lacerate the vagina. By seizing the limb above the fetlock it may be\r\neasily pushed over the head to the proper side, when parturition will\r\nproceed normally.\r\n\r\nFORE LIMB BENT AT KNEE.--The nose and one fore foot present, and on\r\nexamination the knee of the missing fore limb is found farther back.\r\n(Plate XV, fig. 1.) First place a noose each on the presenting pastern\r\nand lower jaw, and push back the body of the fetus with a repeller,\r\nwhile the operator seizing the shank of the bent limb extends it so as\r\nto press back the knee and bring forward the fetlock and foot. As\r\nprogress is made little by little the hand is slid down from the region\r\nof the knee to the fetlock, and finally that is secured and brought up\r\ninto the passage, when parturition will proceed without hindrance. If\r\nboth fore limbs are bent back the head must be noosed and the limbs\r\nbrought up as above, one after the other. It is usually best to employ\r\nthe left hand for the right fore limb, and the right hand for the left\r\nfore limb.\r\n\r\nFORE LIMB TURNED BACK FROM SHOULDERS.--In this case, on exploration by\r\nthe side of the head and presenting limb, the shoulder only can be\r\nreached at first. (Plate XV, fig 4.) By noosing the head and presenting\r\nfore limb, they may be drawn forward into the pelvis, and the oiled hand\r\nbeing carried along the shoulder in the direction of the missing limb is\r\nenabled to reach and seize the forearm just below the elbow. The body is\r\nnow pushed back by the assistants pressing on the head and presenting\r\nlimb or on a repeller planted in the breast until the knee can be\r\nbrought up into the pelvis, after which the procedure is the same as\r\ndescribed in the last paragraph.\r\n\r\nHEAD BENT DOWN BETWEEN FORE LIMBS.--This may be so that the poll or nape\r\nof the neck, with the ears, can be felt far back between the fore limbs,\r\nor so that only the upper border of the neck can be reached, head and\r\nneck being bent back beneath the body. With the head only bent on the\r\nneck, noose the two presenting limbs, then introduce the hand between\r\nthem until the nose can be seized in the palm of the hand. Next have the\r\nassistants push back the presenting limbs, while the nose is strongly\r\nlifted upward over the brim of the pelvis. This accomplished, it assumes\r\nthe natural position and parturition is easy.\r\n\r\nWhen both head and neck are bent downward it may be impossible to reach\r\nthe nose. If, however, the labor has only commenced, the limbs may be\r\ndrawn upon until the operator can reach the ear, by dragging on which\r\nthe head may be so far advanced that the fingers may reach the orbit;\r\ntraction upon this while the limbs are being pushed back may bring the\r\nhead up so that it bends on the neck only, and the further procedure\r\nwill be as described in the last paragraph.\r\n\r\nIf the labor has been long in progress and the fetus is jammed into the\r\npelvis, the womb emptied of the waters, and firmly contracted on its\r\nsolid contents, the case is incomparably more difficult. The mare may be\r\nchloroformed and turned on her back with hind parts elevated, and the\r\nwomb may be injected with sweet oil. Then, if the ear can be reached,\r\nthe correction of the malpresentation may be attempted as above\r\ndescribed. Should this fail, one or more sharp hooks may be inserted in\r\nthe neck as near the head as can be reached, and ropes attached to these\r\nmay be dragged on, while the body of the foal is pushed back by the fore\r\nlimbs or by a repeller. Such repulsion should be made in a direction\r\nobliquely upward toward the loins of the mother, so as to rotate the\r\nfetus in such a way as to bring the head up. As this is accomplished a\r\nhold should be secured nearer and nearer to the nose, with hand or hook,\r\nuntil the head can be straightened out on the neck.\r\n\r\nAll means failing; it becomes necessary to remove the fore limbs\r\n(embryotomy) so as to make more space for bringing up the head. If, even\r\nthen, this can not be accomplished, it may be possible to push the body\r\nbackward and upward with the repeller until the hind limbs are brought\r\nto the passage, when they may be noosed and delivery effected with the\r\nposterior presentation.\r\n\r\nHEAD TURNED ON SHOULDERS.--In this case the fore feet present, and the\r\noiled hand passed along the fore arms in search of the missing head\r\nfinds the side of the neck turned to one side, the head being perhaps\r\nentirely out of reach. (Plate XVIII, fig. 1.) To bring the head forward\r\nit may be desirable to lay the mare on the side opposite to that to\r\nwhich the head is turned, and even to give chloroform or ether. Then the\r\nfeet being noosed, the body of the fetus is pushed by the hand or\r\nrepeller forward and to the side opposite to that occupied by the head\r\nuntil the head comes within reach, near the entrance of the pelvis. If\r\nsuch displacement of the fetus is difficult, it may be facilitated by a\r\nfree use of oil or lard. When the nose can be seized it can be brought\r\ninto the passage, as when the head is turned down. If it can not be\r\nreached, the orbit may be availed of to draw the head forward until the\r\nnose can be seized or the lower jaw noosed. In very difficult cases a\r\nrope may be passed around the neck by the hand or with the aid of a\r\ncurved carrier (Plate XIV), and traction may be made upon this while the\r\nbody is being rotated to the other side. In the same way in bad cases a\r\nhook may be fixed in the orbit or even between the bones of the lower\r\njaw to assist in bringing the head up into position. Should all fail,\r\nthe amputation of the fore limbs may be resorted to, as advised under\r\nthe last heading.\r\n\r\nHEAD TURNED UPWARD ON BACK.--This differs from the last malpresentation\r\nonly in the direction of the head, which has to be sought above rather\r\nthan at one side, and is to be secured and brought forward in a similar\r\nmanner. (Plate XVIII, fig. 2.) If a rope can be passed around the neck\r\nit will prove most effectual, as it naturally slides nearer to the head\r\nas the neck is straightened and ends by bringing the head within easy\r\nreach.\r\n\r\nHIND FEET ENGAGED IN PELVIS.--In this case fore limbs and head present\r\nnaturally, but the hind limbs bent forward from the hip and the loins\r\narched allow the hind feet also to enter the passages, and the further\r\nlabor advances the more firmly does the body of the foal become wedged\r\ninto the pelvis (Plate XVII, fig. 2.) The condition is to be recognized\r\nby introducing the oiled hand along the belly of the fetus, when the\r\nhind feet will be felt advancing. An attempt should at once be made to\r\npush them back, one after the other, over the brim of the pelvis.\r\nFailing in this, the mare may be turned on her back, head downhill, and\r\nthe attempt renewed. If it is possible to introduce a straight rope\r\ncarrier, a noose passed through this may be put on the fetlock and the\r\nrepulsion thereby made more effective. In case of continued failure the\r\nanterior presenting part of the body may be skinned and cut off as far\r\nback toward the pelvis as possible (see \"Embryotomy\"); then nooses are\r\nplaced on the hind fetlocks and traction is made upon these while the\r\nquarters are pushed back into the womb. Then the remaining portion is\r\nbrought away by the posterior presentation.\r\n\r\nANTERIOR PRESENTATION WITH BACK TURNED TO ONE SIDE.--The diameter of the\r\naxis of the foal, like that of the pelvic passages, is from above\r\ndownward, and when the fetus enters the pelvis with this greatest\r\ndiameter engaged transversely or in the narrow diameter of the pelvis,\r\nparturition is rendered difficult or impossible. In such a case the\r\npasterns and head may be noosed, and the passages and engaged portion of\r\nthe foal freely lubricated with lard, the limbs may be crossed over each\r\nother and the head, and a movement of rotation effected in the fetus\r\nuntil its face and back are turned up toward the croup of the mother;\r\nthen parturition becomes natural.\r\n\r\nBACK OF FOAL TURNED TO FLOOR OF PELVIS.--In a roomy mare this is not an\r\ninsuperable obstacle to parturition, yet it may seriously impede it, by\r\nreason of the curvature of the body of the foal being opposite to that\r\nof the passages, and the head and withers being liable to arrest against\r\nthe border of the pelvis. Lubrication of the passage with lard and\r\ntraction of the limbs and head will usually suffice with or without the\r\nturning of the mare on her back.\r\n\r\nIn obstinate cases two other resorts are open: First, to turn the foal,\r\npushing back the fore parts and bringing up the hind so as to make a\r\nposterior presentation, and, second, the amputation of the fore limbs,\r\nafter which extraction will usually be easy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XV.\r\n\r\nABNORMAL PRESENTATIONS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVI.\r\n\r\nABNORMAL PRESENTATIONS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVII.\r\n\r\nABNORMAL PRESENTATIONS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVIII.\r\n\r\nABNORMAL PRESENTATIONS.]\r\n\r\nHIND PRESENTATION WITH LEG BENT AT HOCK.--In this form the quarters of\r\nthe foal with the hind legs bent up beneath them present, but can not\r\nadvance through the pelvis by reason of their bulk. (Plate XV, fig. 3.)\r\nThe oiled hand introduced can recognize the outline of the buttocks,\r\nwith the tail and anus in the center and the sharp points of the hocks\r\nbeneath. First pass a rope around each limb at the hock, then with hand\r\nor repeller push the buttocks backward and upward, until the feet can be\r\nbrought up into the passages. To this the great length of the shank and\r\npastern in the foal is a serious obstacle, and in all cases the foot\r\nshould be protected in the palm of the hand while being brought up over\r\nthe brim of the pelvis; otherwise the womb may be torn. When the pains\r\nare too violent and constant to allow effective manipulation, some\r\nrespite may be obtained by the use of chloroform or morphin and by\r\nturning the mare on her back, but too often the operator fails and the\r\nfoal must be sacrificed. Two courses are still open: First, to cut\r\nthrough the cords behind and above the hock and extend the upper part of\r\nthe limb, leaving the hock bent, and extract in this way, and, second,\r\nto amputate the hind limbs at the hip joint and remove them separately,\r\nafter which the body may be extracted.\r\n\r\nHIND PRESENTATION WITH LEGS BENT FORWARD FROM HIP.--This is merely an\r\naggravated form of the presentation last described. (Plate XVII, fig.\r\n1.) If the mare is roomy, a rope may be passed around each thigh and the\r\nbody pushed upward and forward, so as to bring the hocks and heels\r\nupward. If this can be accomplished, nooses are placed on the limb\r\nfurther and further down until the fetlock is reached and brought into\r\nposition. If failure is met with, then amputation at the hips is the\r\nlast resort.\r\n\r\nHIND PRESENTATIONS WITH BACK TURNED SIDEWAYS OR DOWNWARD.--These are the\r\ncounterparts of similar anterior presentations and are to be managed in\r\nthe same way.\r\n\r\nPRESENTATION OF THE BACK.--This is rare, yet not unknown, the foal being\r\nbent upon itself with the back, recognizable by its sharp row of spines,\r\npresented at the entrance of the pelvis and the head and all four feet\r\nturned back into the womb. (Plate XVI, fig. 1.) The body of the fetus\r\nmay be extended across the opening transversely, so that the head\r\ncorresponds to one side (right or left), or it may be vertical, with the\r\nhead above or below.\r\n\r\nIn any such position the object should be to push the body of the fetus\r\nforward and upward or to one side, as may best promise to bring up the\r\nfore or hind extremities, and bring the latter into the passage so as to\r\nconstitute a normal anterior or posterior presentation. This turning of\r\nthe fetus may be favored by a given position of the mother, by the free\r\nuse of oil or lard on the surface of the fetus, and by the use of a\r\npropeller.\r\n\r\nPRESENTATION OF BREAST AND ABDOMEN.--This is the reverse of the back\r\npresentation, the foal being extended across in front of the pelvic\r\nopening, but with the belly turned toward the passages and with all four\r\nfeet engaged in the passage. (Plate XVI, fig. 2.) The most promising\r\ncourse is to secure the hind feet with nooses and then push the fore\r\nfeet forward into the womb. As soon as the fore feet are pushed forward\r\nclear of the brim of the pelvis, traction is made on the hind feet so as\r\nto bring the thighs into the passage and prevent the reentrance of the\r\nfore limbs. If it proves difficult to push the fore limbs back, a noose\r\nmay be passed around the fetlock of each and the cord drawn through the\r\neye of a rope carrier, by means of which the members may be easily\r\npushed back.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMBRYOTOMY.\r\n\r\nEmbryotomy consists in the dissection of the fetus, so as to reduce its\r\nbulk and allow of its exit through the pelvis. The indications for its\r\nadoption have been furnished in the foregoing pages. The operation will\r\nvary in different cases according to the necessity for the removal of\r\none or more parts in order to secure the requisite reduction in size.\r\nThus it may be needful to remove head and neck, one fore limb or both,\r\none hind limb or both, to remove different parts of the trunk, or to\r\nremove superfluous (monstrous) parts. Some of the simplest operations in\r\nembryotomy (incision of the head in hydrocephalus, incision of the belly\r\nin dropsy) have already been described. It remains to notice the more\r\ndifficult procedures which can be best undertaken by the skilled\r\nanatomist.\r\n\r\nAMPUTATION OF THE HEAD.--This is easy when both fore limbs are turned\r\nback and the head alone has made its exit in part. It is more difficult\r\nwhen the head is still retained in the passages or womb, as in\r\ndouble-headed monsters. The head is secured by a hook in the lower jaw,\r\nor in the orbit, or by a halter, and the skin is divided circularly\r\naround the lower part of the face or at the front of the ears, according\r\nto the amount of head protruding. Then an incision is made backward\r\nalong the line of the throat, and the skin dissected from the neck as\r\nfar back as possible. Then the muscles and other soft parts of the neck\r\nare cut across, and the bodies of two vertebra (neck bones) are severed\r\nby cutting completely across the cartilage of the joint. The bulging of\r\nthe ends of the bones will serve to indicate the seat of the joint. The\r\nhead and detached portion of the neck may now be removed by steady\r\npulling. If there is still an obstacle, the knife may be again used to\r\nsever any obstinate connections. In the case of a double-headed monster,\r\nthe whole of the second neck must be removed with the head. When the\r\nhead has been detached, a rope should be passed through the eyeholes,\r\nor through an artificial opening in the skin, and tied firmly around\r\nthe skin, to be employed as a means of traction when the missing limbs\r\nor the second head have been brought up into position.\r\n\r\nAMPUTATION OF THE HIND LIMB.--This may be required when there are extra\r\nhind limbs or when the hind limbs are bent forward at hock or hip joint.\r\nIn the former condition the procedure resembles that for removal of a\r\nfore limb, but requires more anatomical knowledge. Having noosed the\r\npastern, a circular incision is made through the skin around the\r\nfetlock, and a longitudinal one from that up to the groin, and the skin\r\nis dissected from the limb as high up as can be reached, over the croup,\r\nif possible. Then cut through the muscles around the hip joint, and, if\r\npossible, the two interarticular ligaments of the joint (pubofemoral and\r\nround), and extract the limb by strong dragging.\r\n\r\nAMPUTATION OF THE FORE LIMBS.--This may usually be begun on the fetlock\r\nof the limb projecting from the vulva. An embryotomy knife is desirable.\r\nThis knife consists of a blade with a sharp, slightly hooked point, and\r\none or two rings in the back of the blade large enough to fit on the\r\nmiddle finger, while the blade is protected in the palm of the hand.\r\n(See Plate XIII, fig. 4.) Another form has the blade inserted in a\r\nmortise in the handle, from which it is pushed out by a movable button\r\nwhen wanted. First place a noose around the fetlock of the limb to be\r\namputated, cut the skin circularly entirely around the fetlock, then\r\nmake an incision on the inner side of the limb from the fetlock up to\r\nthe breastbone. Next dissect the skin from the limb, from the fetlock up\r\nto the breastbone on the inner side, and as far up on the shoulder blade\r\nas possible on the outer side. Finally, cut through the muscles\r\nattaching the limb to the breastbone, and employ strong traction on the\r\nlimb, so as to drag out the whole limb, shoulder blade included. The\r\nmuscles around the upper part of the shoulder blade are easily torn\r\nthrough and need not be cut, even if that were possible. In no case\r\nshould the fore limb be removed unless the shoulder blade is taken with\r\nit, as that furnishes the greatest obstruction to delivery, above all\r\nwhen it is no longer advanced by the extension of the fore limb, but is\r\npressed back so as to increase the already thickest posterior portion of\r\nthe chest. The preservation of the skin from the whole limb is\r\nadvantageous in various ways; it is easier to cut it circularly at the\r\nfetlock than at the shoulder; it covers the hand and knife in making the\r\nneedful incisions, thus acting as a protection to the womb; and it\r\naffords a means of traction on the body after the limb has been removed.\r\nIn dissecting the skin from the limb the knife is not needful at all\r\npoints; much of it may be stripped off with the fingers or knuckles, or\r\nby a blunt, iron spud, pushed up inside the hide, which is meanwhile\r\nheld tense to render the spud effective.\r\n\r\nIn case the limb is bent forward at the hock, a rope is passed round\r\nthat and pulled so as to bring the point of the hock between the lips of\r\nthe vulva. The hamstring and the lateral ligaments of the hock are now\r\ncut through, and the limbs extended by a rope tied round the lower end\r\nof the long bone above (tibia). In case it is still needful to remove\r\nthe upper part of the limb, the further procedure is the same as\r\ndescribed in the last paragraph.\r\n\r\nIn case the limb is turned forward from the hip, and the fetus so wedged\r\ninto the passage that turning is impossible, the case is very difficult.\r\nI have repeatedly succeeded by cutting in on the hip joint and\r\ndisarticulating it, then dissecting the muscles back from the upper end\r\nof the thigh bone. A noose was placed around the neck of the bone and\r\npulled on forcibly, while any unduly resisting structures were cut with\r\nthe knife.\r\n\r\nCartwright recommends to make free incisions round the hip joints and\r\ntear through the muscles when they can not be cut; then with cords round\r\nthe pelvic bones, and hooks inserted in the openings in the floor of the\r\npelvis to drag out the pelvic bones; then put cords around the heads of\r\nthe thigh bones and extract them; then remove the intestines; finally,\r\nby means of the loose, detached skin, draw out the body with the\r\nremainder of the hind limbs bent forward beneath it.\r\n\r\nReuff cuts his way into the pelvis of the foal, and with a knife\r\nseparates the pelvic bones from the loins, then skinning the quarter\r\ndraws out these pelvic bones by means of ropes and hooks, and along with\r\nthem the hind limbs.\r\n\r\nThe hind limbs having been removed by one or the other of these\r\nprocedures, the loose skin detached from the pelvis is used as a means\r\nof traction and delivery is effected. In case of a monstrosity with\r\nextra hind limbs, it may be possible to bring these up into the passage\r\nand utilize them for traction.\r\n\r\n_Removal of the abdominal viscera._--In case the belly is unduly large,\r\nfrom decomposition, tumors, or otherwise, it may be needful to lay it\r\nopen with the knife and cut or tear out the contents.\r\n\r\n_Removal of the thoracic viscera._--To diminish the bulk of the chest it\r\nhas been found advisable to cut out the breastbone, remove the heart and\r\nlungs, and allow the ribs to collapse with the lower free ends\r\noverlapping each other.\r\n\r\n_Dissection of the trunk._--In case it becomes necessary to remove other\r\nportions of the trunk, we should follow the general rule of preserving\r\nthe skin so that all manipulations can be made inside this as a\r\nprotector, that it may remain available as a means of exercising\r\ntraction on the remaining part of the body, and as a covering to protect\r\nthe vaginal walls against injuries from bones while such part is\r\npassing.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOODING, OR BLEEDING FROM THE WOMB.\r\n\r\nThis is rare in the mare, but not unknown, in connection with a failure\r\nof the womb to contract on itself after parturition, or with eversion of\r\nthe womb (casting the withers), and congestion or laceration. If the\r\nblood accumulates in the flaccid womb, the condition may be suspected\r\nonly by reason of the rapidly advancing weakness, swaying, unsteady\r\ngait, hanging head, paleness of the eyes and other mucous membranes, and\r\nweak, small, failing pulse. The hand introduced into the womb detects\r\nthe presence of the blood partly clotted. If the blood escapes by the\r\nvulva, the condition is evident.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ consists in evacuating the womb of its blood clots, giving a\r\nlarge dose of powdered ergot of rye, and in the application of cold\r\nwater or ice to the loins and external generative organs. Besides this,\r\na sponge impregnated with a strong solution of alum, or, still better,\r\nwith tincture of muriate of iron, may be introduced into the womb and\r\nsqueezed so as to bring the liquid in contact with the walls generally.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVERSION OF THE WOMB.\r\n\r\nIf the womb fails to contract after difficult parturition, the\r\nafter-pains will sometimes lead to the fundus passing into the body of\r\nthe organ and passing through that and the vagina until the whole\r\ninverted organ appears externally and hangs down on the thighs. The\r\nresult is rapid engorgement and swelling of the organ, impaction of the\r\nrectum with feces, and distention of the bladder with urine, all of\r\nwhich conditions seriously interfere with the return of the mass. In\r\nreturning the womb the standing is preferable to the recumbent position,\r\nas the abdomen is more pendent and there is less obstruction to the\r\nreturn. It may, however, be necessary to put hobbles on the hind limbs\r\nto prevent the mare from kicking. A clean sheet should be held beneath\r\nthe womb, and all filth, straw, and foreign bodies washed from its\r\nsurface. Then with a broad, elastic (india-rubber) band, or in default\r\nof that a long strip of calico 4 or 5 inches wide, wind the womb as\r\ntightly as possible, beginning at its most dependent part (the extremity\r\nof the horn). This serves two good ends. It squeezes out into the\r\ngeneral circulation the enormous mass of blood which engorged and\r\nenlarged the organ, and it furnishes a strong protective covering for\r\nthe now delicate, friable organ, through which it may be safely\r\nmanipulated without danger of laceration. The next step may be the\r\npressure on the general mass while those portions next the vulva are\r\ngradually pushed in with the hands; or the extreme lowest point (the end\r\nof the horn) may be turned within itself and pushed forward into the\r\nvagina by the closed fist, the return being assisted by manipulations by\r\nthe other hand, and even by those of assistants. By either mode the\r\nmanipulations may be made with almost perfect safety so long as the\r\norgan is closely wrapped in the bandage. Once a portion has been\r\nintroduced into the vagina the rest will usually follow with increasing\r\nease, and the operation should be completed with the hand and arm\r\nextended the full length within the womb and moved from point to point\r\nso as to straighten out all parts of the organ and insure that no\r\nportion still remain inverted within another portion. Should any such\r\npartial inversion be left it will give rise to straining, under the\r\nforce of which it will gradually increase until the whole mass will be\r\nprotruded as before. The next step is to apply a truss as an effectual\r\nmechanical barrier to further escape of the womb through the vulva. The\r\nsimplest is made with two 1-inch ropes, each about 18 feet long, each\r\ndoubled and interwoven at the bend, as seen in Plate XIV, figure 4. The\r\nring formed by the interlacing of the two ropes is adjusted around the\r\nvulva, the two ends of the one rope are carried up on the right and left\r\nof the tail and along the spine, being wound around each other in their\r\ncourse, and are finally tied to the upper part of the collar encircling\r\nthe neck. The remaining two ends, belonging to the other rope, are\r\ncarried downward and forward between the thighs and thence forward and\r\nupward on the sides of the belly and chest to be attached to the right\r\nand left sides of the collar. These ropes are drawn tightly enough to\r\nkeep closely applied to the opening without chafing, and will fit still\r\nmore securely when the mare raises her back to strain. It is desirable\r\nto tie the mare short so that she may be unable to lie down for a day or\r\ntwo, and she should be kept in a stall with the hind parts higher than\r\nthe fore. Violent straining may be checked by full doses of opium\r\n(one-half dram), and any costiveness or diarrhea should be obviated by a\r\nsuitable laxative or binding diet.\r\n\r\nIn some mares the contractions are too violent to allow of the return of\r\nthe womb, and full doses of opium one-half dram, laudanum 2 ounces, or\r\nchloral hydrate 1 ounce, may be demanded, or the mare must be rendered\r\ninsensible by ether or chloroform.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUPTURE, OR LACERATION, OF THE WOMB.\r\n\r\nThis may occur from the feet of the foal during parturition, or from\r\nill-directed efforts to assist, but it is especially liable to take\r\nplace in the everted, congested, and friable organ. The resultant\r\ndangers are bleeding from the wound, escape of the bowels through the\r\nopening and their fatal injury by the mare's feet or otherwise, and\r\nperitonitis from the extension of inflammation from the wound and from\r\nthe poisonous action of the septic liquids of the womb escaping into the\r\nabdominal cavity. The first object is to close the wound, but unless in\r\neversion of the womb this is practically impossible. In the last-named\r\ncondition the wound must be carefully and accurately sewed up before\r\nthe womb is returned. After its return, the womb must be injected daily\r\nwith an antiseptic solution (borax, one-half ounce, or carbolic acid, 3\r\ndrams to a quart of tepid water). If inflammation threatens, the abdomen\r\nmay be bathed continuously with hot water by means of a heavy woolen\r\nrag, and large doses of opium (one-half dram) may be given twice or\r\nthrice daily.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUPTURES OF THE VAGINA.\r\n\r\nThese are attended with dangers similar to those belonging to rupture of\r\nthe womb, and in addition by the risk of protrusion of the bladder,\r\nwhich appears through the lips of the vulva as a red, pyriform mass.\r\nSometimes such lacerations extend downward into the bladder, and in\r\nothers upward into the terminal gut (rectum). In still other cases the\r\nanus is torn so that it forms one common orifice with the vulva.\r\n\r\nToo often such cases prove fatal, or at least a recovery is not\r\nattained, and urine or feces or both escape freely into the vagina. The\r\nsimple laceration of the anus is easily sewed up, but the ends of the\r\nmuscular fibers do not reunite and the control over the lower bowel is\r\nnever fully reacquired. The successful stitching up of the wound\r\ncommunicating with the bladder or the rectum requires unusual skill and\r\ncare, and though I have succeeded in a case of the latter kind, I can\r\nnot advise the attempt by unprofessional persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOOD CLOTS IN THE WALLS OF THE VAGINA.\r\n\r\n(See \"Effusion of blood in the vaginal walls,\" p. 190.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLAMINITIS, OR FOUNDER, FOLLOWING PARTURITION.\r\n\r\nThis sometimes follows on inflammation of the womb, as it frequently\r\ndoes on disorder of the stomach. Its symptoms agree with those of the\r\ncommon form of founder, and treatment need not differ.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE WOMB AND PERITONEUM.\r\n\r\nThese may result from injuries sustained by the womb during or after\r\nparturition, from exposure to cold or wet, or from the irritant\r\ninfective action of putrid products within the womb. Under the\r\ninflammation the womb remains dilated and flaccid, and decomposition of\r\nits secretions almost always occurs, so that the inflammation tends to\r\nassume a putrid character and general septic infection is likely to\r\noccur.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are ushered in by shivering, staring coat,\r\nsmall, rapid pulse, elevated temperature, accelerated breathing, loss of\r\nappetite, with arched back, stiff movement of the body, looking back at\r\nthe flanks, and uneasy motions of the hind limbs, discharge from the\r\nvulva of a liquid at first watery, reddish, or yellowish, and later it\r\nmay be whitish or glairy, and fetid or not in different cases.\r\nTenderness of the abdomen shown on pressure is especially\r\ncharacteristic of cases affecting the peritoneum or lining of the belly,\r\nand is more marked lower down. If the animal survives, the inflammation\r\ntends to become chronic and attended by a whitish mucopurulent\r\ndischarge. If, on the contrary, it proves fatal, death is preceded by\r\nextreme prostration and weakness from the general septic poisoning.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In treatment the first thing to be sought is the removal\r\nof all offensive and irritant matters from the womb through a caoutchouc\r\ntube introduced into the womb, and into which a funnel is fitted. Warm\r\nwater should be passed until it comes away clear. To insure that all the\r\nwomb has been washed out, the oiled hand may be introduced to carry the\r\nend of the tube into the two horns successively. When the offensive\r\ncontents have been thus removed, the womb should be injected with a\r\nquart of water holding in solution 1 dram permanganate of potash, or, in\r\nthe absence of the latter, 2 teaspoonfuls of carbolic acid, twice daily.\r\nFomentation of the abdomen, or the application of a warm flaxseed\r\npoultice, may greatly relieve. Acetanilid, in doses of half an ounce,\r\ntwice or thrice a day, or sulphate of quinia in doses of one-third\r\nounce, may be employed to reduce the fever. If the great prostration\r\nindicates septic poisoning, large doses (one-half ounce) bisulphite of\r\nsoda, or salicylate of soda, or sulphate of quinin may be resorted to.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEUCORRHEA.\r\n\r\nThis is a white, glutinous, chronic discharge, the result of a\r\ncontinued, subacute inflammation of the mucous membrane of the womb.\r\nLike the discharge of acute inflammation, it contains many forms of\r\nbacteria, by some of which it is manifestly inoculable on the penis of\r\nthe stallion, producing ulcers and a specific, gonorrheal discharge.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ may consist in the internal use of tonics (sulphate of iron,\r\n3 drams, daily) and the washing out of the womb, as described under the\r\nlast heading, followed by an astringent antiseptic injection (carbolic\r\nacid, 2 teaspoonfuls; tannic acid, 1/2 dram; water, 1 quart). This may\r\nbe given two or three times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE UDDER AND TEATS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGESTION AND INFLAMMATION OF THE UDDER.\r\n\r\nThis is comparatively rare in the mare, though in some cases the udder\r\nbecomes painfully engorged before parturition, and a doughy swelling,\r\npitting on pressure, extends forward on the lower surface of the\r\nabdomen. When this goes on to active inflammation, one or both of the\r\nglands becomes enlarged, hot, tense, and painful; the milk is dried up\r\nor replaced by a watery or reddish, serous fluid, which at times becomes\r\nfetid; the animal walks lame, loses appetite, and shows general disorder\r\nand fever. The condition may end in recovery, in abscess, induration,\r\nor gangrene, and, in some cases, may lay the foundation for a tumor of\r\nthe gland.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment is simple so long as there is only\r\ncongestion. Active rubbing with lard or oil, or, better, camphorated\r\noil, and the frequent drawing off of the milk, by the foal or with the\r\nhand, will usually bring about a rapid improvement. When active\r\ninflammation is present, fomentation with warm water may be kept up for\r\nan hour and followed by the application of the camphorated oil, to which\r\nhas been added some carbonate of soda and extract of belladonna. A dose\r\nof laxative medicine (4 drams Barbados aloes) will be of service in\r\nreducing fever, and one-half ounce saltpeter daily will serve a similar\r\nend. In case the milk coagulates in the udder and can not be withdrawn,\r\nor when the liquid becomes fetid, a solution of 20 grains carbonate of\r\nsoda and 10 drops carbolic acid dissolved in an ounce of water should be\r\ninjected into the teat. In doing this it must be noted that the mare has\r\nthree separate ducts opening on the summit of each teat and each must be\r\ncarefully injected. To draw off the fetid product it may be needful to\r\nuse a small milking tube, or spring teat dilator designed by the writer.\r\n(Plate XIV, figs. 2 and 3.) When pus forms and points externally and can\r\nnot find a free escape by the teat, the spot where it fluctuates must be\r\nopened freely with the knife and the cavity injected daily with the\r\ncarbolic-acid lotion. When the gland becomes hard and indolent, it may\r\nbe rubbed daily with iodin ointment 1 part, vaseline 6 parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUMORS OF THE UDDER.\r\n\r\nAs the result of inflammation of the udder it may become the seat of an\r\nindurated diseased growth, which may go on growing and seriously\r\ninterfere with the movement of the hind limbs. If such swellings do not\r\ngive way in their early stages to treatment by iodin, the only resort is\r\nto cut them out with a knife. As the gland is often implicated and has\r\nto be removed, such mares can not in the future suckle their colts and\r\ntherefore should not be bred.\r\n\r\n\r\nSORE TEATS, SCABS, CRACKS, WARTS.\r\n\r\nBy the act of sucking, especially in cold weather, the teats are subject\r\nto abrasions, cracks, and scabs, and as the result of such irritation,\r\nor independently, warts sometimes grow and prove troublesome. The warts\r\nshould be clipped off with sharp scissors and their roots burned with a\r\nsolid pencil of lunar caustic. This is best done before parturition to\r\nsecure healing before suckling begins. For sore teats use an ointment of\r\nvaseline 1 ounce, balsam of tolu 5 grains, and sulphate of zinc 5\r\ngrains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nBy M. R. TRUMBOWER, V. S.\r\n\r\n[Revised by John R. Mohler, A. M., V. M. D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n(Pl. XIX.)\r\n\r\nThe nervous system may be regarded as consisting of two sets of organs,\r\nperipheral and central, the function of one being to establish a\r\ncommunication between the centers and the different parts of the body,\r\nand that of the other to generate nervous force. The whole may be\r\narranged under two divisions: First, the cerebrospinal system; second,\r\nthe sympathetic or ganglionic system. Each is possessed of its own\r\ncentral and peripheral organs.\r\n\r\nIn the first, the center is made up of two portions--one large and\r\nexpanded (the brain) placed in the cranial cavity; the other elongated\r\n(spinal cord), continuous with the brain, and lodged in the canal of the\r\nvertebral column. The peripheral portion of this system consists of the\r\ncerebrospinal nerves, which leave the axis in symmetrical pairs and are\r\ndistributed to the skin, the voluntary muscles, and the organs.\r\n\r\nIn the second, the central organ consists of a chain of ganglia,\r\nconnected by nerve cords, which extends on each side of the spine from\r\nthe head to the rump. The nerves of this system are distributed to the\r\ninvoluntary muscles, mucous membrane, viscera, and blood vessels.\r\n\r\nThe two systems have free intercommunication, ganglia being at the\r\njunctions.\r\n\r\nTwo substances, distinguishable by their color, namely, the white or\r\nmedullary and the gray or cortical substance, enter into the formation\r\nof nervous matter. Both are soft, fragile, and easily injured, in\r\nconsequence of which the principal nervous centers are well protected by\r\nbony coverings. The nervous substances present two distinct forms--nerve\r\nfibers and nerve cells. An aggregation of nerve cells constitutes a\r\nnerve ganglion.\r\n\r\nThe nerve fibers represent a conducting apparatus and serve to place the\r\ncentral nervous organs in connection with peripheral end organs. The\r\nnerve cells, however, besides transmitting impulses, act as\r\nphysiological centers for automatic, or reflex, movements, and also for\r\nthe sensory, perceptive, trophic, and secretory functions. A nerve\r\nconsists of a bundle of tubular fibers, held together by a dense\r\nareolar tissue, and inclosed in a membranous sheath--the neurilemma.\r\nNerve fibers possess no elasticity, but are very strong. Divided nerves\r\ndo not retract.\r\n\r\nNerves are thrown into a state of excitement when stimulated, and are,\r\ntherefore, said to possess excitable or irritable properties. The\r\nstimuli may be applied to, or may act upon, any part of the nerve.\r\nNerves may be paralyzed by continuous pressure being applied. When the\r\nnerves divide into branches, there is never any splitting up of their\r\nultimate fibers, nor yet is there ever any coalescing of them; they\r\nretain their individuality from their source to their termination.\r\n\r\nNerves which convey impressions to the centers are termed sensory, or\r\ncentripetal, and those which transmit stimulus from the centers to\r\norgans of motion are termed motor, or centrifugal. The function of the\r\nnervous system may, therefore, be defined in the simplest terms, as\r\nfollows: It is intended to associate the different parts of the body in\r\nsuch a manner that stimulus applied to one organ may excite or depress\r\nthe activity of another.\r\n\r\nThe brain is that portion of the cerebrospinal axis within the cranium,\r\nwhich may be divided into four parts--the medulla oblongata, the\r\ncerebellum, the pons Varolii, and the cerebrum--and it is covered by\r\nthree membranes, called the meninges. The outer of these membranes, the\r\ndura mater, is a thick, white, fibrous membrane which lines the cavity\r\nof the cranium, forming the internal periosteum of the bones; it is\r\ncontinuous with the spinal cord to the extremity of the canal. The\r\nsecond, the arachnoid, is a delicate serous membrane, and loosely\r\nenvelops the brain and spinal cord; it forms two layers, having between\r\nthem the arachnoid space which contains the cerebrospinal fluid, the use\r\nof which is to protect the spinal cord and brain from pressure. The\r\nthird, or inner, the pia mater, is closely adherent to the entire\r\nsurface of the brain, but is much thinner and more vascular than when it\r\nreaches the spinal cord, which it also envelops, and is continued to\r\nform the sheaths of the spinal nerves.\r\n\r\nThe medulla oblongata is the prolongation of the spinal cord, extending\r\nto the pons Varolii. This portion of the brain is very large in the\r\nhorse: it is pyramidal in shape, the narrowest part joining the cord.\r\n\r\nThe pons Varolii is the transverse projection on the base of the brain,\r\nbetween the medulla oblongata and the peduncles of the cerebrum.\r\n\r\nThe cerebellum is lodged in the posterior part of the cranial cavity,\r\nimmediately above the medulla oblongata; it is globular or elliptical in\r\nshape, the transverse diameter being greatest. The body of the\r\ncerebellum is composed of gray matter externally and of white matter in\r\nthe center. The cerebellum has the function of co-ordinating movements;\r\nthat is, of so associating them as to cause them to accomplish a\r\ndefinite purpose. Injuries to the cerebellum cause disturbances of the\r\nequilibrium but do not interfere with the will power or intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe cerebrum, or brain proper, occupies the anterior portion of the\r\ncranial cavity. It is ovoid in shape, with an irregular, flattened base,\r\nand consists of lateral halves or hemispheres. The greater part of the\r\ncerebrum is composed of white matter. The hemispheres of the cerebrum\r\nare usually said to be the seat of all psychical activities. Only when\r\nthey are intact are the process of feeling, thinking, and willing\r\npossible. After they are destroyed the organism comes to be like a\r\ncomplicated machine, and its activity is only the expression of the\r\ninternal and external stimuli which act upon it.\r\n\r\nThe spinal cord, or spinal marrow, is that part of the cerebrospinal\r\nsystem which is contained in the spinal canal of the backbone, and\r\nextends from the medulla oblongata to a short distance behind the loins.\r\nIt is an irregularly cylindrical structure, divided into two lateral,\r\nsymmetrical halves by fissures. The spinal cord terminates posteriorly\r\nin a pointed extremity, which is continued by a mass of nerve\r\ntrunks--cauda equinae. A transverse section of the cord reveals that it\r\nis composed of white matter externally and of gray matter internally.\r\nThe spinal cord does not fill the whole spinal canal. The latter\r\ncontains, besides, a large venous sinus, fatty matter, the membranes of\r\nthe cord, and the cerebrospinal fluid.\r\n\r\nThe spinal nerves, forty-two or forty-three in number, arise each by two\r\nroots, a superior or sensory, and an inferior or motor. The nerves\r\noriginating from the brain are twenty-four in number, and arranged in\r\npairs, which are named first, second, third, etc., counting from before\r\nbackward. They also receive special names, according to their functions\r\nor the parts to which they are distributed, viz:\r\n\r\n    1. Olfactory.\r\n    2. Optic.\r\n    3. Oculo-motor.\r\n    4. Pathetic.\r\n    5. Trifacial.\r\n    6. Abducens.\r\n    7. Facial.\r\n    8. Auditory.\r\n    9. Glossopharyngeal.\r\n    10. Pneumogastric.\r\n    11. Spinal accessory.\r\n    12. Hypoglossal.\r\n\r\n\r\nInflammation of the Brain and its Membranes (Encephalitis, Meningitis,\r\nCerebritis).\r\n\r\nInflammation may attack these membranes singly, or any one of the\r\nanatomical divisions of the nerve matter, or it may invade the whole at\r\nonce. Practical experience, however, teaches us that primary\r\ninflammation of the dura mater is of rare occurrence, except in direct\r\nmechanical injuries to the head or diseases of the bones of the cranium.\r\nNeither is the arachnoid often affected with acute inflammation, except\r\nas a secondary result. The pia mater is most commonly the seat of\r\ninflammation, acute and subacute, but from its intimate relation with\r\nthe surface of the brain the latter very soon becomes involved in the\r\nmorbid changes. Practically, we can not separate inflammation of the pia\r\nmater from that of the brain proper. Inflammation may, however, exist in\r\nthe center of the great nerve masses--the cerebrum, cerebellum, pons\r\nVarolii, or medulla at the base of the brain--without involving the\r\nsurface. When, therefore, inflammation invades the brain and its\r\nenveloping membranes it is properly called encephalitis; when the\r\nmembranes alone are affected it is called meningitis, or the brain\r\nsubstance alone cerebritis. Since all the conditions merge into one\r\nanother and can scarcely be recognized separately during the life of the\r\nanimal, they may here be considered together.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Exposure to extreme heat or cold, sudden and extreme changes\r\nof temperature, excessive continued cerebral excitement, too much\r\nnitrogenous feed, direct injuries to the brain, such as concussion, or\r\nfrom fracture of the cranium, overexertion, sometimes as sequelae to\r\ninfluenza, pyemia, poisons having a direct influence upon the encephalic\r\nmass, extension of inflammation from neighboring structures, food\r\npoisoning, tumors, parasites, metastatic abscesses, etc.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The diseases here grouped together are accompanied with a\r\nvariety of symptoms, almost none of which, however, are associated so\r\ndefinitely with a special pathological process as to point unmistakably\r\nto a given lesion. Usually the first symptoms indicate mental\r\nexcitement, and are followed by symptoms indicating depression. Acute\r\nencephalitis may be ushered in by an increased sensibility to noises,\r\nwith more or less nervous excitability, contraction of the pupils of the\r\neyes, and a quick, hard pulse. In very acute attacks these symptoms,\r\nhowever, are not always noted. This condition will soon be followed by\r\nmuscular twitchings, convulsive or spasmodic movements, eyes wide open\r\nwith shortness of sight. The animal becomes afraid to have his head\r\nhandled. Convulsions and delirium will develop, with inability of\r\nmuscular control, or stupor and coma may supervene. When the membranes\r\nare greatly implicated, convulsions and delirium with violence may be\r\nexpected, but if the brain substances are principally affected stupor\r\nand coma will be the prominent symptoms. In the former condition the\r\npulse will be quick and hard; in the latter, soft and depressed, with\r\noften a dilatation of the pupils, and deep, slow, stertorous breathing.\r\nThe symptoms may follow one another in rapid succession, and the disease\r\napproach a fatal termination within 12 hours. In subacute attacks the\r\nsymptoms are better defined, and the animal seldom dies before the third\r\nday. Within three or four days gradual improvement may become manifest,\r\nor cerebral softening with partial paralysis may occur. In all cases of\r\nencephalitis there is a marked rise in temperature from the very onset\r\nof the disease, with a tendency to increase until the most alarming\r\nsymptoms develop, succeeded by a decrease when coma becomes manifest.\r\nThe violence and character of the symptoms greatly depend upon the\r\nextent and location of the structures involved. Thus, in some cases\r\nthere may be marked paralysis of certain muscles, while in others there\r\nmay be spasmodic rigidity of muscles in a certain region. Very rarely\r\nthe animal becomes extremely violent early in the attack, and by rearing\r\nup, striking with the fore feet, or falling over, may do himself great\r\ninjury. Usually, however, the animal maintains the standing position,\r\npropping himself against the manger or wall, until he falls from\r\ninability of muscular control, or from unconsciousness. Occasionally, in\r\nhis delirium, he may go through a series of automatic movements, such as\r\ntrotting or walking, and, if loose in a stall, will move around\r\npersistently in a circle. Early and persistent constipation of the\r\nbowels is a marked symptom in nearly all acute affections of the brain;\r\nretention of the urine, also, is frequently observed.\r\n\r\nFollowing these symptoms there are depression, loss of power and\r\nconsciousness, lack of ability or desire to move, and usually fall of\r\ntemperature. At this stage the horse stands with legs propped, the head\r\nhanging or resting on the manger, the eyes partly closed, and does not\r\nrespond when spoken to or when struck with a whip.\r\n\r\nChronic encephalitis or meningitis may succeed the acute stage, or may\r\nbe due to stable miasma, blood poison, narcotism, lead poisoning, etc.\r\nThis form may not be characterized in its initial stages by\r\nexcitability, quick and hard pulse, and high fever. The animal usually\r\nappears at first stupid; eats slowly; the pupil of the eye does not\r\nrespond to light quickly; the animal often throws his head up or shakes\r\nit as if suffering sudden twinges of pain. He is slow and sluggish in\r\nhis movements, or there may be partial paralysis of one limb, one side\r\nof the face, neck, or body. These symptoms, with some variations, may be\r\npresent for several days and then subside, or the disease may pass into\r\nthe acute stage and terminate fatally. Chronic encephalitis may effect\r\nan animal for ten days or two weeks without much variation in the\r\nsymptoms before the crisis is reached. If improvement commences, the\r\nsymptoms usually disappear in the reverse order to that in which they\r\ndeveloped, with the exception of the paralytic effects, which remain\r\nintractable or permanent. Paralysis of certain sets of muscles is a very\r\ncommon result of chronic, subacute, and acute encephalitis, and is due\r\nto softening of the brain or to exudation into the cavities of the brain\r\nor arachnoid space.\r\n\r\nSoftening and abscess of the brain are terminations of cerebritis. It\r\nmay also be due to an insufficient supply of blood as a result of\r\ndiseased cerebral arteries and of apoplexy. The symptoms are drowsiness,\r\nvertigo, or attacks of giddiness, increased timidity, or fear of\r\nfamiliar objects, paralysis of one limb, hemiplegia, imperfect control\r\nof the limbs, and usually a weak, intermittent pulse. In some cases the\r\nsymptoms are analogous to those of apoplexy. The character of the\r\nsymptoms depends upon the seat of the softening or abscess within the\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\nCerebral sclerosis sometimes follows inflammation in the structure of\r\nthe brain affecting the connective tissues, which eventually become\r\nhypertrophied and press upon nerve cells and fibers, causing their\r\nultimate disappearance, leaving the parts hard and indurated. This\r\ncondition gives rise to a progressive paralysis and may extend along a\r\ncertain bundle of fibers into the spinal cord. Complete paralysis almost\r\ninvariably supervenes and causes death.\r\n\r\n_Lesions._--On making post-mortem examinations of horses which have died\r\nin the first stages of either of these diseases we find an excessive\r\nengorgement of the capillaries and small blood vessels, with\r\ncorrespondingly increased redness and changes in both the contents and\r\nthe walls of the vessels. If death has occurred at a later period of the\r\ndisease, it will be found that, in addition to the redness and\r\nengorgement, an exudation of the contents of the blood vessels into the\r\ntissues and upon the surfaces of the inflamed parts has supervened. If\r\nthe case has been one of encephalitis, there will usually be found more\r\nor less watery fluid in the ventricles (natural cavities in the brain),\r\nin the subarachnoid space, and a serous exudation between the\r\nconvolutions and interstitial spaces of the gray matter under the\r\nmembranes of the brain. The quantity of fluid varies in different cases.\r\nExudations of a membranous character may be present, and are found\r\nattached to the surfaces of the pia mater.\r\n\r\nIn meningitis, especially in chronic cases, in addition to the serous\r\neffusion, there are changes which may be regarded as characteristic in\r\nthe formation of a delicate and highly vascular layer or layers of\r\nmembrane or organized structure on the surface of the dura mater, and\r\nalso indications of hemorrhages in connection with the membranous\r\nformations. Hematoma, or blood tumors, may be found embedded in this\r\nmembrane. In some cases the hemorrhages are copious, causing paralysis\r\nor apoplexy, followed by speedy death. The meningitis may be\r\nsuppurative. In this case a puslike exudate is found between the\r\nmembranes covering the brain.\r\n\r\nIn cerebritis, or inflammation of the interior of the brain, there is a\r\ntendency to softening and suppuration and the formation of abscesses. In\r\nsome cases the abscesses are small and numerous, surrounded with a\r\nsoftened condition of the brain matter, and sometimes we may find one\r\nlarge abscess. In cases of recent development the walls of the\r\nabscesses are fringed and ragged and have no lining membrane. In older\r\nor chronic cases the walls of the abscesses are generally lined with a\r\nstrong membrane, often having the appearance of a sac or cyst, and the\r\ncontents have a very offensive odor.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In all acute attacks of inflammation involving the\r\nmembranes or cerebral masses, it is the pressure from the distended and\r\nengorged blood vessels and the rapid accumulation of inflammatory\r\nproducts that endangers the life of the animal in even the very early\r\nstage of the disease. The earlier the treatment is commenced to lessen\r\nthe danger of fatal pressure from the engorged blood vessels, the less\r\neffusion and smaller number of inflammatory products we have to contend\r\nwith later. The leading object, then, to be accomplished in the\r\ntreatment of the first stage of encephalitis, meningitis, or cerebritis,\r\nand before a dangerous degree of effusion or exudation has taken place,\r\nis to relieve the engorgement of the blood vessels and thereby lessen\r\nthe irritation or excitability of the affected structures. If the\r\nattempt to relieve the engorgement in the first stage has been only\r\npartially successful, and the second stage, with its inflammatory\r\nproducts and exudations, whether serous or plastic, has set in, then the\r\nmain objects in further treatment are to keep up the strength of the\r\nanimal and hasten the absorption of the exudative products as much as\r\npossible. To obtain these results, when the animal is found in the\r\ninitial stage of the disease, if there is unnatural excitability or\r\nstupor with increase of temperature and quickened pulse, we should apply\r\ncold to the head in the form of cold water or ice. For this purpose\r\ncloths or bags may be used, and they should be renewed as often as\r\nnecessary. If the disease is still in its early stages and the animal is\r\nstrong, bleeding from the jugular vein may be beneficial. Good results\r\nare to be expected only during the stage of excitement, while there is a\r\nstrong, full pulse and the mucous membranes of the head are red from a\r\nplentiful supply of blood. The finger should be kept on the pulse and\r\nthe blood allowed to flow until there is distinct softening of the\r\npulse. As soon as the animal recovers somewhat from the shock of the\r\nbleeding the following medicine should be made into a ball or dissolved\r\nin a pint of warm water and be given at one dose: Barbados aloes, 7\r\ndrams; calomel, 2 drams; powdered ginger, 1 dram; tincture of aconite,\r\n20 drops.\r\n\r\nThe animal should be placed in a cool, dark place, as free from noise as\r\npossible. When the animal becomes thirsty half an ounce of bromid of\r\npotash may be dissolved in the drinking water every six hours.\r\nInjections of warm water into the rectum may facilitate the action of\r\nthe purgative. Norwood's tincture of veratrum viride, in 20-drop doses,\r\nshould be given every hour and 1 dram of solid extract of belladonna\r\nevery four hours until the symptoms become modified and the pulse\r\nregular and full.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE NERVOUS SYSTEM.]\r\n\r\nIf this treatment fails to give relief, the disease will pass into the\r\nadvanced stages, or, if the animal has been neglected in the early\r\nstages, the treatment must be supplanted with the hypodermic injection\r\nof ergotin, in 5-grain doses, dissolved in 1 dram of water, every six\r\nhours. The limbs may be poulticed above the fetlocks with mustard. Warm\r\nblanketing, to promote perspiration, is to be observed always when there\r\nis no excessive perspiration.\r\n\r\nIf the disease becomes chronic (encephalitis or meningitis), we must\r\nplace our reliance upon alteratives and tonics, with such incidental\r\ntreatment as special symptoms may demand. Iodid of potassium in 2-dram\r\ndoses should be given three times a day and 1 dram of calomel once a day\r\nto induce absorption of effusions or thickened membranes. Tonics, in the\r\nform of iodid of iron in 1-dram doses, to which is added 2 drams of\r\npowdered hydrastis, may also be given every six or eight hours, as soon\r\nas the active fever has abated. After the disappearance of the acute\r\nsymptoms, blisters (cantharides ointment) may be applied behind the\r\npoll. When paralytic effects remain after the disappearance of all other\r\nsymptoms, sulphate of strychnia in 2-grain doses, in combination with\r\nthe other tonics, may be given twice a day and be continued until it\r\nproduces muscular twitching. In some cases of paralysis, as of the lips\r\nor throat, benefit may be derived from the moderate use of the electric\r\nbattery. Many of the recoveries will, however, under the most active and\r\nearly treatment, be but partial, and in all cases the animals become\r\npredisposed to subsequent attacks. A long time should be allowed to pass\r\nbefore the animal is exposed to severe work or great heat. When the\r\ndisease depends upon mechanical injuries, they have to be treated and\r\nall causes of irritation to the brain removed. If it is due to stable\r\nmiasma, uremic poisoning, pyemia, influenza, rheumatism, toxic agents,\r\netc., they should receive prompt attention for their removal or\r\nmitigation.\r\n\r\nCerebral softening, abscess, and sclerosis are practically inaccessible\r\nto treatment, otherwise than such relief as may be afforded by the\r\nadministration of opiates and general tonics, and, in fact, the\r\ndiagnosis is largely presumptive.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGESTION OF THE BRAIN, OR MEGRIMS.\r\n\r\nCongestion of the brain consists in an accumulation of blood in the\r\nvessels, also called hyperemia, or engorgement. It may be active or\r\npassive--active when there is an undue accumulation of blood or\r\ndiminished arterial resistance, and passive when it accumulates in the\r\nvessels of the brain, owing to some obstacle to its return by the veins.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Active cerebral congestion may be from hypertrophy of the\r\nleft ventricle of the heart, excessive exertion, the influence of\r\nextreme heat, sudden and great excitement, artificial stimulants, etc.\r\nPassive congestion may be produced by any mechanical obstruction which\r\nprevents the proper return of blood through the veins to the heart, such\r\nas a small or ill-fitting collar, which often impedes the blood current,\r\ntumors or abscesses pressing on the vein in its course, and organic\r\nlesions of the heart with regurgitation.\r\n\r\nExtremely fat animals with short, thick necks are peculiarly subject to\r\nattacks of cerebral congestion. Simple congestion, however, is merely a\r\nfunctional affection, and in a slight or moderate degree involves no\r\nimmediate danger. Extreme engorgement, on the contrary, may be followed\r\nby rupture of previously weakened arteries and capillaries and cause\r\nimmediate death, designated then as a stroke of apoplexy.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Congestion of the brain is usually sudden in its\r\nmanifestation and of short duration. The animal may stop very suddenly\r\nand shake its head or stand quietly braced, then stagger, make a plunge,\r\nand fall. The eyes are staring, breathing hurried and stertorous, and\r\nthe nostrils widely dilated. This may be followed by coma, violent\r\nconvulsive movements, and death. Generally, however, the animal gains\r\nrelief in a short time, but may remain weak and giddy for several days.\r\nIf it is due to organic change of the heart or the disease of the blood\r\nvessels in the brain, then the symptoms may be of slow development,\r\nmanifested by drowsiness, dimness or imperfect vision, difficulty in\r\nvoluntary movements, diminished sensibility of the skin, loss of\r\nconsciousness, delirium, and death. In milder cases effusion may take\r\nplace in the arachnoid spaces and ventricles of the brain, followed by\r\nparalysis and other complications.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._--In congestion of the brain the cerebral vessels are loaded\r\nwith blood, the venous sinuses distended to an extreme degree, and the\r\npressure exerted upon the brain constitutes actual compression, giving\r\nrise to the symptoms just mentioned. On post-mortem examinations this\r\nengorgement is found universal throughout the brain and its membranes,\r\nwhich serves to distinguish it from inflammations of these structures,\r\nin which the engorgements are confined more or less to circumscribed\r\nportions. A prolonged congestion may, however, lead to active\r\ninflammation, and in that case we find serous and plastic exudations in\r\nthe cavities of the brain. In addition to the intensely engorged\r\ncondition of the vessels we find the gray matter of the brain redder\r\nthan natural. In cases in which several attacks have occurred the blood\r\nvessels are often found permanently dilated.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The animal should be taken out of harness at once, with\r\nprompt removal of all mechanical obstructions to the circulation. If it\r\nis caused by venous obstruction by too tight a collar, the loosening of\r\nthe collar will give immediate relief. The horse should be bled freely\r\nfrom the jugular vein. If due to tumors or abscesses, a surgical\r\noperation becomes necessary to afford relief. To revive the animal if it\r\nbecomes partially or totally unconscious, cold water should be dashed on\r\nthe head. Give a purge of Glauber's salt. If the limbs are cold,\r\ntincture of capsicum or strong mustard water should be applied to them.\r\nIf symptoms of paralysis remain after two or three days, an active\r\ncathartic and iodid of potassium will be indicated, to be given as\r\nprescribed for inflammation of the brain. In confirmed cases, treatment\r\nis not advisable, as there is considerable danger to the owner should an\r\nattack occur in a crowded street.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--Well-adjusted collar, with strap running from the collar\r\nto the girth, to hold down the collar when pulling upgrade; regular feed\r\nand exercise, without allowing the animal to become excessively\r\nplethoric; moderate checking, allowing a free-and-easy movement of the\r\nhead; well-ventilated stabling, proper cleanliness, pure water, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNSTROKE, HEAT STROKE, OR HEAT EXHAUSTION.\r\n\r\nThe term sunstroke is applied to affections occasioned not exclusively\r\nby exposure to the sun's rays, as the word signifies, but by the action\r\nof great heat combined generally with humid atmosphere. Exhaustion\r\nproduced by long-continued heat is often the essential factor, and is\r\ncalled heat exhaustion. Horses on the race track undergoing protracted\r\nand severe work in hot weather often succumb to heat exhaustion. Draft\r\nhorses which do not receive proper care in watering, feeding, and rest\r\nin shady places and are exposed for many hours to the direct rays of the\r\nsun suffer very frequently from sunstroke.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Sunstroke is manifested suddenly. The animal stops, drops\r\nhis head, begins to stagger, and soon falls to the ground unconscious.\r\nThe breathing is marked with great stertor, the pulse is very slow and\r\nirregular, cold sweats break out in patches on the surface of the body,\r\nand the animal often dies without having recovered consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe temperature becomes very high, reaching 105 deg. to 109 deg. F.\r\n\r\nIn heat exhaustion the animal usually requires urging for some time\r\nprior to the appearance of any other symptoms, generally perspiration is\r\nchecked, and then the horse becomes weak in its gait, the breathing\r\nhurried or panting, eyes watery or bloodshot, nostrils dilated and\r\nhighly reddened, assuming a dark, purple color; the pulse is rapid and\r\nweak, the heart bounding, followed by unconsciousness and death. If\r\nrecovery takes place, convalescence extends over a long period of time,\r\nduring which incoordination of movement may persist.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._--Sunstroke, virtually active congestion of the brain, often\r\naccompanied with effusion and blood extravasation, characterizes this\r\ncondition, with often rapid and fatal lowering of all the vital\r\nfunctions. In many instances the death may be due to the complete\r\nstagnation in the circulation of the brain, inducing anemia, or want of\r\nnourishment of that organ. In other cases it may be directly due to the\r\nexcessive compression of the nerve matter controlling the heart's\r\naction, and cause paralysis of that organ. There are also changes in the\r\ncomposition of the blood.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The animal should be placed in shaded surroundings. Under\r\nno circumstances is blood-letting permissible in sunstroke. Ice or very\r\ncold water should be applied to the head and along the spine, and half\r\nan ounce of carbonate of ammonia or 6 ounces of whisky should be given\r\nin 1 pint of water. Cold water may be used as an enema and should also\r\nbe showered upon the body of the horse from the hose or otherwise. This\r\nshould be continued until the temperature is down to 103 deg. F. Brisk\r\nfriction of the limbs and the application of spirits of camphor often\r\nyields good results. The administration of the stimulants should be\r\nrepeated in one hour if the pulse has not become stronger and slower. In\r\neither case, when reaction has occurred, preparations of iron and\r\ngeneral tonics may be given during convalescence: Sulphate of iron, 1\r\ndram; gentian, 3 drams; red cinchona bark, 2 drams; mix and give in feed\r\nmorning and evening.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--In very hot weather horses should have wet sponges or\r\nlight sunshades on the head when at work, or the head may be sponged\r\nwith cold water as many times a day as possible. Proper attention should\r\nbe given to feeding and watering, never in excess. During the warm\r\nmonths all stables should be cool and well ventilated, and if an animal\r\nis debilitated from exhaustive work or disease it should receive such\r\ntreatment as will tend to build up the system. Horses should be\r\npermitted to drink as much water as they want while they are at work\r\nduring hot weather.\r\n\r\nAn animal which has been affected with sunstroke is very liable to have\r\nsubsequent attacks when exposed to the necessary exciting causes.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPOPLEXY OR CEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE.\r\n\r\nApoplexy is often confounded with cerebral congestion, but true apoplexy\r\nalways consists in rupture of cerebral blood vessels, with blood\r\nextravasation and formation of blood clot.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Two causes are involved in the production of apoplexy, the\r\npredisposing and the exciting. The predisposing cause is degeneration,\r\nor disease which weakens the blood vessel; the exciting cause is any one\r\nwhich tends to induce cerebral congestion.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Apoplexy is characterized by a sudden loss of sensation and\r\nmotion, profound coma, and stertorous, difficult breathing. The action\r\nof the heart is little disturbed at first, but soon becomes slower, then\r\nquicker and feebler, and after a little time ceases. If the rupture is\r\none of a small artery and the extravasation limited, sudden paralysis of\r\nsome part of the body is the result. The extent and location of the\r\nparalysis depend upon the location within the brain which is\r\nfunctionally deranged by the pressure of the extravasated blood; hence\r\nthese conditions are very variable.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any premonitory symptoms or an increase of temperature\r\nin the early stage of the attack, we may be reasonably certain in making\r\nthe distinction between this disease and congestion of the brain, or\r\nsunstroke.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._--In apoplexy there is generally found an atheromatous\r\ncondition of the cerebral vessels, with weakening and degeneration of\r\ntheir walls. When a large artery has been ruptured it is usually\r\nfollowed by immediate death, and large rents may be found in the\r\ncerebrum, with great destruction of brain tissue, induced by the\r\nforcible pressure of the liberated blood. In small extravasations\r\nproducing local paralysis without marked general disturbance the animal\r\nmay recover after a time; in such cases gradual absorption of the clot\r\ntakes place. In large clots atrophy of the brain substances may follow,\r\nor softening and abscess from want of nutrition may result, and render\r\nthe animal worthless, ultimately resulting in death.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Place the animal in a quiet, cool place and avoid all\r\nstimulating feed. Administer, in the drinking water or feed, 2 drams of\r\nthe iodid of potassium twice a day for several weeks if necessary.\r\nMedical interference with sedatives or stimulants is more liable to be\r\nharmful than of benefit, and blood-letting in an apoplectic fit is\r\nextremely hazardous. From the fact that cerebral apoplexy is due to\r\ndiseased or weakened blood vessels, the animal remains subject to\r\nsubsequent attacks. For this reason treatment is very unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPRESSION OF THE BRAIN.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--In injuries from direct violence a piece of broken bone may\r\npress upon the brain, and, according to its size, the brain is robbed of\r\nits normal space within the cranium. It may also be due to an\r\nextravasation of blood or to exudation in the subdural or arachnoid\r\nspaces. Death from active cerebral congestion results through\r\ncompression. The occurrence may sometimes be traced to the direct cause,\r\nwhich will give assurance for the correct diagnosis.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Impairment of all the special senses and localized\r\nparalysis. All the symptoms of lessened functional activity of the brain\r\nare manifested to some degree. The paralysis remains to be our guide\r\nfor the location of the cause, for it will be found that the paralysis\r\noccurs on the opposite side of the body from the location of the injury,\r\nand the parts suffering paralysis will denote, to an expert veterinarian\r\nor physician, the part of the brain which is suffering compression.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Trephining, by a skillful operator, for the removal of the\r\ncause when due to depressed bone or the presence of foreign bodies. When\r\nthe symptoms of compression follow other acute diseases of the brain,\r\napoplectic fits, etc., the treatment must be such as the exigencies of\r\nthe case demands.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCUSSION OF THE BRAIN.\r\n\r\nThis is generally caused by falling over backward and striking the poll,\r\nor perhaps falling forward on the nose, by a blow on the head, etc.\r\nTrain accidents during shipping often cause concussion of the brain.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Concussion of the brain is characterized by giddiness,\r\nstupor, insensibility, or loss of muscular power, succeeding immediately\r\nupon a blow or severe injury involving the cranium. The animal may rally\r\nquickly or not for hours; death may occur on the spot or after a few\r\ndays. When there is only slight concussion or stunning, the animal soon\r\nrecovers from the shock. When more severe, insensibility may be complete\r\nand continue for a considerable time; the animal lies as if in a deep\r\nsleep; the pupils are insensible to light; the pulse fluttering or\r\nfeeble; the surface of the body cold, muscles relaxed, and the breathing\r\nscarcely perceptible. After a variable interval partial recovery may\r\ntake place, which is marked by paralysis of some parts of the body,\r\noften of a limb, the lips, ear, etc. Convalescence is usually tedious,\r\nand frequently permanent impairment of some organs remains.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._--Concussion produces laceration of the brain, or at least a\r\njarring of the nervous elements, which, if not sufficiently severe to\r\nproduce sudden death, may lead to softening or inflammation, with their\r\nrespective symptoms of functional derangement.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The first object in treatment will be to establish\r\nreaction or to arouse the feeble and weakening heart. This can often be\r\naccomplished by dashing cold water on the head and body of the animal;\r\nfrequent injections of weak ammonia water, ginger tea, or oil and\r\nturpentine should be given per rectum. In the majority of cases this\r\nwill soon bring the horse to a state of consciousness. In more severe\r\ncases mustard poultices should be applied along the spine and above the\r\nfetlocks. As soon as the animal gains partial consciousness stimulants,\r\nin the form of whisky or capsicum tea, should be given. Owing to\r\nseverity of the structural injury to the brain or the possible rupture\r\nof blood vessels and blood extravasation, the reaction may often be\r\nfollowed by encephalitis or cerebritis, and will then have to be treated\r\naccordingly. For this reason the stimulants should not be administered\r\ntoo freely, and they must be abandoned as soon as reaction is\r\nestablished. There is no need for further treatment unless complications\r\ndevelop as a secondary result. Bleeding, which is so often practiced,\r\nproves almost invariably fatal in this form of brain affection. We\r\nshould also remember that it is never safe to drench a horse with large\r\nquantities of medicine when he is unconscious, for he is very liable to\r\ndraw the medicine into the lungs in inspiration.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--Young horses, when harnessed or bitted for the first few\r\ntimes, should not have their heads checked high, for it frequently\r\ncauses them to rear up, and, being unable to control their balance, they\r\nare liable to fall over sideways or backwards, thus causing brain\r\nconcussion when they strike the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nANEMIA OF THE BRAIN.\r\n\r\nThis is a physiological condition in sleep. It is considered a disease\r\nor may give rise to disease when the circulation and blood supply of the\r\nbrain are interfered with. In some diseases of the heart the brain\r\nbecomes anemic, and fainting fits occur, with temporary loss of\r\nconsciousness. Tumors growing within the cranium may press upon one or\r\nmore arteries and stop the supply of blood to certain parts of the\r\nbrain, thus inducing anemia, ultimately atrophy, softening, or\r\nsuppuration. Probably the most frequent cause is found in plugging, or\r\nocclusion, of the arteries by a blood clot.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Imperfect vision, constantly dilated pupils, frequently a\r\nfeeble and staggering gait, and occasionally cramps, convulsions, or\r\nepileptic fits occur.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._--The exact opposite of cerebral hyperemia. The blood\r\nvessels are found empty, the membranes blanched, and the brain substance\r\nsoftened.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Removal of the remote cause when possible. General tonics,\r\nnutritious feed, rest, and removal from all causes of nervous\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDROCEPHALUS, OR DROPSY OF THE BRAIN.\r\n\r\nThis condition consists in an unnatural collection of fluid about or in\r\nthe brain. Depending upon the location of the fluid, we speak of\r\nexternal and internal hydrocephalus.\r\n\r\nExternal hydrocephalus is seen chiefly in young animals. It consists in\r\na collection of fluid under the meninges, but outside the brain proper.\r\nThis defect is usually congenital. It is accompanied with an\r\nenlargement of the skull, especially in the region of the forehead. The\r\npressure of the fluid may cause the bones to soften. The disease is\r\nincurable and usually fatal.\r\n\r\nInternal hydrocephalus is a disease of mature horses, and consists in\r\nthe accumulation of an excessive quantity of fluid in the cavities or\r\nventricles of the cerebrum. The cause of this accumulation may be a\r\nprevious inflammation, a defect in the circulation of blood through the\r\nbrain, heat stroke, overwork, excessive nutrition, or long-continued\r\nindigestion. Common, heavy-headed draft horses are predisposed to this\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are an expression of dullness and stupidity,\r\nand from their nature this disease is sometimes known as \"dumminess\" or\r\n\"immobility.\" A horse so afflicted is called a \"dummy.\" Among the\r\nsymptoms are loss of intelligence, stupid expression, poor memory, etc.\r\nThe appetite is irregular; the horse may stop chewing with a wisp of hay\r\nprotruding from his lips; he seems to forget that it is there. Unnatural\r\npositions are sometimes assumed, the legs being placed in clumsy and\r\nunusual attitudes. Such horses are difficult to drive, as they do not\r\nrespond readily to the word, to pressure of the bit, or to the whip.\r\nGradually the pulse becomes weaker, respiration becomes faster, and the\r\nsubject loses weight. Occasionally there are periods of great excitement\r\ndue to temporary congestion of the brain. At such times the horse\r\nbecomes quite uncontrollable. A horse so afflicted is said to have\r\n\"staggers.\" The outlook for recovery is not good.\r\n\r\nTreatment is merely palliative. Regular work or exercise and nutritious\r\nfeed easy of digestion, with plenty of fresh water, are strongly\r\nindicated. Intensive feeding should not be practiced. The bowels should\r\nbe kept open by the use of appropriate diet or by the use of small\r\nregular doses of Glauber's salt.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUMORS WITHIN THE CRANIUM.\r\n\r\nTumors within the cranial cavity and the brain occur not infrequently,\r\nand give rise to a variety of symptoms, imperfect control of voluntary\r\nmovement, local paralysis, epilepsy, etc. Among the more common tumors\r\nare the following:\r\n\r\nOsseous tumors, growing from the walls of the cranium, are not very\r\nuncommon.\r\n\r\nDentigerous cysts, containing a formation identical to that of a tooth,\r\ngrowing from the temporal bone, sometimes are found lying loose within\r\nthe cranium.\r\n\r\nTumors of the choroid plexus, known as brain sand, are frequently met\r\nwith on post-mortem examinations, but seldom give rise to any\r\nappreciable symptoms during life. They are found in horses at all ages,\r\nand are slow of development. They are found in one or both of the\r\nlateral ventricles, enveloped in the folds of the choroid plexus.\r\n\r\nMelanotic tumors have been found in the brain and meninges in the form\r\nof small, black nodules in gray horses, and in one instance are believed\r\nto have induced the condition known as stringhalt.\r\n\r\nFibrous tumors may develop within or from the meningeal structures of\r\nthe brain.\r\n\r\nGliomatous tumor is a variety of sarcoma very rarely found in the\r\nstructure of the cerebellum.\r\n\r\nTreatment for tumors of the brain is impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPASMS, OR CRAMPS.\r\n\r\nSpasm is a marked symptom in many diseases of the brain and of the\r\nspinal cord. Spasms may result from irritation of the motor nerves as\r\nconductors, or may result from irritation of any part of the sympathetic\r\nnervous system, and they usually indicate an excessive action of the\r\nreflex motor centers. Spasms may be induced by various medicinal agents\r\ngiven in poisonous doses, or by effete materials in the circulation,\r\nsuch as nux vomica or its alkaloid strychnia, lead preparations, or an\r\nexcess of the urea products in the circulation, etc. Spasms may be\r\ndivided into two classes: Tonic spasm, when the cramp is continuous or\r\nresults in persistent rigidity, as in tetanus; clonic spasm, when the\r\ncramping is of short duration, or is alternated with relaxations. Spasms\r\nmay affect involuntary as well as the voluntary muscles, the muscles of\r\nthe glottis, intestines, and even the heart. They are always sudden in\r\ntheir development.\r\n\r\n_Spasm of the glottis._--This is manifested by a strangling respiration;\r\na wheezing noise is produced in the act of inspiration; extreme anxiety\r\nand suffering for want of air. The head is extended, the body profusely\r\nperspiring; pulse very rapid; soon great exhaustion becomes manifest;\r\nthe mucous membranes become turgid and very dark colored, and the animal\r\nthus may suffocate in a short time.\r\n\r\n_Spasm of the intestines._--(See \"Cramp colic,\" p. 74.)\r\n\r\n_Spasm of the neck of the bladder._--This may be due to spinal\r\nirritation or a reflex from intestinal irritation, and is manifested by\r\nfrequent but ineffectual attempts to urinate.\r\n\r\n_Spasm of the diaphragm, or thumps._--Spasmodic contraction of the\r\ndiaphragm, the principal muscle used in respiration, is generally\r\noccasioned by extreme and prolonged speeding on the race track or road.\r\nThe severe strain thus put upon this muscle finally induces irritation\r\nof the nerves controlling it, and the contractions become very forcible\r\nand violent, giving the jerking character known among horsemen as\r\n\"thumps.\" This condition may be distinguished from violent beating of\r\nthe heart by feeling the pulse beat at the angle of the jaw, and at the\r\nsame time watching the jerking movement of the body, when it will be\r\ndiscovered that the two bear no relation to each other. (See\r\n\"Palpitation of the heart,\" p. 259.)\r\n\r\n_Spasm of the thigh, or cramp of a hind limb._--This is frequently\r\nwitnessed in horses that stand on sloping plank floors--generally in\r\ncold weather--or it may come on soon after severe exercise. It is\r\nprobably due to an irritation of the nerves of the thigh. In cramps of\r\nthe hind leg the limb becomes perfectly rigid, and attempts to flex are\r\nunsuccessful; the animal stands on the affected limb, but is unable to\r\nmove it; it is unnaturally cold; it does not, however, appear to cause\r\nmuch suffering unless attempts are made to change position. This cramp\r\nmay be of short duration--a few minutes--or it may persist for several\r\ndays. This condition is often taken for a dislocation of the stifle\r\njoint. In the latter the foot is extended backward, and the horse is\r\nunable to advance it, but drags the limb. An examination of the joint\r\nalso reveals a change in form. Spasms may affect the eyelids, by closure\r\nor by retraction. Spasm of the sterno-maxillaris muscle has been\r\nwitnessed, and the animal was unable to close the jaws until the muscle\r\nbecame relaxed.\r\n\r\n_Treatment of spasms._--An anodyne liniment, composed of chloroform 1\r\npart and soap liniment 4 parts, applied to cramped muscles will usually\r\ncause relaxation. This may be used when single external muscles are\r\naffected. In spasms of the glottis, inhalation of sulphuric ether will\r\ngive quick relief. In spasm of the diaphragm, rest and the\r\nadministration of half an ounce of chloroform in 3 ounces of whisky,\r\nwith a pint of water added, will generally suffice to bring relief, or\r\nif this fails give 5 grains of sulphate of morphia by hypodermic\r\ninjection. If spasms result from organic disease of the nervous system,\r\nthe latter should receive such treatment as its character demands. In\r\ncramp of the leg, compulsory movement usually causes relaxation very\r\nquickly; therefore the animal should be led out of the stable and be\r\nforced to run or trot. Sudden, nervous excitement caused by a crack of\r\nthe whip or smart blow will often bring about immediate relief. Should\r\nthis fail, the anodyne liniment may be used along the inside of the\r\nthigh, and chloroform, ether, or laudanum given internally. An ounce of\r\nthe chloral hydrate will certainly relieve the spasm when given\r\ninternally, but the cramp may return soon after the effect has passed\r\noff, which in many cases it does very quickly.\r\n\r\n_Convulsions._--Although there is no disease of the nervous system which\r\ncan be properly termed convulsive, or justify the use of the word\r\nconvulsion to indicate any particular disease, yet it is often such a\r\nprominent symptom that a few words may not be out of place. General,\r\nirregular muscular contractions of various parts of the body, with\r\nunconsciousness, characterize what we regard as convulsions, and like\r\nordinary spasms are dependent upon some disease or irritation of the\r\nnervous structures, chiefly of the brain. No treatment is required; in\r\nfact, a general convulsion must necessarily be self-limited in its\r\nduration. Suspending, as it does, respiratory movements, checking the\r\noxygenation and decarbonization of the blood, the rapid accumulation of\r\ncarbonic-acid gas in the blood and the exclusion of oxygen quickly puts\r\nthe blood in a condition to produce the most reliable and speedy\r\nsedative effect upon the nerve excitability that could be found, and\r\nconsequently furnishes its own remedy so far as the continuance of the\r\nconvulsive paroxysm is concerned. Whatever treatment is instituted must\r\nbe directed toward a removal of the cause of the convulsive paroxysm.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOREA, OR ST. VITUS'S DANCE.\r\n\r\nChorea is characterized by involuntary contractions of voluntary\r\nmuscles. This disease is an obscure disorder, which may be from pressure\r\nupon a nerve, cerebral or spinal sclerosis, small aneurisms in the\r\nbrain, etc. Choreic symptoms have been produced by injecting granules of\r\nstarch into the arteries entering the brain. Epilepsy and other forms of\r\nconvulsions simulate chorea in appearance.\r\n\r\nStringhalt is by some termed \"chorea.\" This is manifested by a sudden\r\njerking up of one or both hind legs when the animal is walking. This\r\nsymptom may be very slight in some horses, but has a tendency to\r\nincrease with age. In some the catching up of the affected leg is very\r\nviolent, and when it is lowered to the ground the motion is equally\r\nsudden and forcible, striking the foot to the ground like a pile driver.\r\nVery rarely chorea may be found to affect one of the fore legs, or the\r\nmuscles of one side of the neck or the upper part of the neck.\r\nInvoluntary jerking of the muscles of the hip or thigh is seen\r\noccasionally, and is termed \"shivering\" by horsemen.\r\n\r\nChorea is often associated with a nervous disposition, and is not so\r\nfrequent in animals with a sluggish temperament. The involuntary\r\nmuscular contractions cause no pain, and do not appear to produce much\r\nexhaustion of the affected muscles, although the jerking may be regular\r\nand persistent whenever the animal is in motion.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In a few cases, early in the appearance of this affection,\r\ngeneral nerve tonics may be of benefit, viz, iodid of iron, 1 dram;\r\npulverized nux vomica, 1 dram; pulverized scutellaria (skull-cap), 1\r\nounce. Mix and give in the feed once a day for two weeks. Arsenic in the\r\nform of Fowler's solution is often beneficial. If the cause is connected\r\nwith organic brain lesions, treatment is usually unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILEPSY, OR FALLING FITS.\r\n\r\nThe cause of epilepsy is seldom traceable to any special brain lesions.\r\nIn a few cases it accompanies disease of the pituitary body, which is\r\nlocated in the under surface of the brain. Softening of the brain may\r\ngive rise to this affection. Attacks may occur only once or twice a year\r\nor they may be of frequent recurrence.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--No premonitory symptoms precede an epileptic fit. The\r\nanimal suddenly staggers; the muscles become cramped; the jaws may be\r\nspasmodically opened and closed, and the tongue become lacerated between\r\nthe teeth; the animal foams at the mouth and falls in a spasm. The urine\r\nflows involuntarily, and the breathing may be temporarily arrested. The\r\nparoxysm soon passes off, and the animal gets on its feet in a few\r\nminutes after the return of consciousness.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Dashing cold water on the head during the paroxysm. After\r\nthe recovery 1 dram of oxid of zinc may be given in the feed twice a day\r\nfor several weeks, or benefit may be derived from the tonic prescribed\r\nfor chorea.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARALYSIS, OR PALSY.\r\n\r\nParalysis is a weakness or cessation of the muscular contraction by\r\ndiminution of loss of the conducting power or stimulation of the motor\r\nnerves. Paralytic affections are of two kinds, the complete and the\r\nincomplete. The former includes those in which both motion and\r\nsensibility are affected; the latter those in which only one or the\r\nother is lost or diminished. Paralysis may be general or partial. The\r\nlatter is divided into hemiplegia and paraplegia. When only a small\r\nportion of the body is affected, as the face, a limb, the tail, it is\r\ndesignated by the term local paralysis. When the irritation extends from\r\nthe periphery of the center it is termed reflex paralysis.\r\n\r\nCauses are much varied. Most of the acute affections of the brain and\r\nspinal cord may lead to paralysis. Injuries, tumors, disease of the\r\nblood vessels of the brain, etc., all have a tendency to produce\r\nsuspension of the conducting motive power to the muscular structures.\r\nPressure upon, or the severing of, a nerve causes a paralysis of the\r\nparts to which such a nerve is distributed. Apoplexy may be termed a\r\ngeneral paralysis, and in nonfatal attacks is a frequent cause of the\r\nvarious forms of palsy.\r\n\r\nGENERAL PARALYSIS.--This can not take place without producing immediate\r\ndeath. The term is, however, usually applied to paralysis of the four\r\nextremities, whether any other portions of the body are involved or not.\r\nThis form of palsy is due to compression of the brain by congestion of\r\nits vessels, large clot formation in apoplexy, concussion, or shock, or\r\nany disease in which the whole brain structure is involved in functional\r\ndisturbance.\r\n\r\nHEMIPLEGIA (PARALYSIS OF ONE SIDE OR HALF OF THE BODY).--Hemiplegia is\r\nfrequently the result of a tumor in the lateral ventricles of the brain,\r\nsoftening of one hemisphere of the cerebrum, pressure from extravasated\r\nblood, fracture of the cranium, or it may be due to poisons in the blood\r\nor to reflex origin. When hemiplegia is due to or the result of a prior\r\ndisease of the brain, especially of an inflammatory character, it is\r\nseldom complete; it may affect only one limb and one side of the head,\r\nneck, or muscles along the back, and may pass off in a few days after\r\nthe disappearance of all the other evidences of the primary affection.\r\nIn most cases, however, hemiplegia arises from emboli obstructing one or\r\nmore blood vessels of the brain, or the rupture of some vessel the wall\r\nof which had become weakened by degeneration and the extravasation of\r\nblood. Sensibility in most cases is not impaired, but in some there is a\r\nloss of sensibility as well as of motion. In some cases the bladder and\r\nrectum are involved in the paralysis.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--In hemiplegia the attack may be very sudden, and the animal\r\nfall, powerless to move one side of the body; one side of the lips will\r\nbe relaxed; the tongue may hang out on one side of the mouth; the tail\r\ncurved around sideways; an inability to swallow feed or water may be\r\npresent, and often the urine dribbles away as fast as it collects in the\r\nbladder. Sensibility of the affected side may be entirely lost or only\r\npartial; the limbs may be cold and sometimes unnaturally warm. In cases\r\nwherein the attack is not so severe the animal may be able to maintain\r\nthe standing position, but will have great difficulty in moving the\r\naffected side. In such cases the animal may recover from the disability.\r\nIn the more severe, in which there is complete loss of power of\r\nmovement, recoveries are rare.\r\n\r\nPARAPLEGIA (TRANSVERSE PARALYSIS OF THE HIND EXTREMITIES).--Paralysis of\r\nthe hind extremities is usually due to some injury or inflammation\r\naffecting the spinal cord. (See \"Spinal meningitis,\" p. 232, and\r\n\"Myelitis,\" p. 233.) It may also be due to a reflex irritation from\r\ndisease of peripheral nerves, to spinal irritation or congestion caused\r\nby blood poisons, etc.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--When due to mechanical injury of the spinal cord, from a\r\nbroken back or spinal hemorrhage, it is generally progressive in its\r\ncharacter, although it may be sudden. When it is caused by agents in the\r\nblood, it may be intermittent or recurrent.\r\n\r\nParaplegia is not difficult to recognize, for it is characterized by a\r\nweakness and imperfect control of the hind legs and powerless tail. The\r\nurine usually dribbles away as it is formed and the manure is pushed\r\nout, ball by ball, without any voluntary effort, or the passages may\r\ncease entirety. When paraplegia is complete, large and ill-conditioned\r\nsores soon form on the hips and thighs from chafing and bruising, which\r\nhave a tendency quickly to weaken the animal and necessitate his\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nLOCOMOTOR ATAXIA, OR INCOORDINATION OF MOVEMENT.--This is characterized\r\nby an inability to control properly the movement of the limbs. The\r\nanimal appears usually perfectly healthy, but when he is led out of his\r\nstall his legs have a wobbly movement and he will stumble or stagger,\r\nespecially in turning. When this is confined to the hind parts it may be\r\ntermed a modified form of paraplegia, but often it may be seen to affect\r\nnearly all the voluntary muscles when they are called into play, and\r\nmust be attributed to some pressure exerted on the base of the brain.\r\n\r\nLOCAL PARALYSIS.--This is frequently met with in horses. It may affect\r\nmany parts of the body, even vital organs, and it is very frequently\r\noverlooked in diagnosis.\r\n\r\nFACIAL PARALYSIS.--This is a frequent type of local paralysis, and is\r\ndue to impairment of function of the motor nerve of the facial muscles,\r\nthe portio dura. The cause may exist at the base of the brain,\r\ncompression along its course after it leaves the medulla oblongata, or\r\nto a bruise after it spreads out on the great masseter muscle.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--A flaccid condition of the cheek muscles, pendulous lips,\r\ninability to grasp the feed, often a slow and weak movement in chewing,\r\nand difficulty and slowness in drinking.\r\n\r\nLARYNGISMUS PARALYTICUS, OR ROARING.--This condition is characterized by\r\nroaring, and is usually caused by an inflamed or hypertrophied bronchial\r\ngland pressing against the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, which\r\ninterferes with its conducting power. A similar condition is\r\noccasionally induced in acute pleurisy, when the recurrent nerve becomes\r\ninvolved in the diseased process or compressed by plastic exudation.\r\n\r\nPARALYSIS OF THE RECTUM AND TAIL.--This is generally the result of a\r\nblow or fall on the rump, which causes a fracture of the sacrum bone and\r\ninjury to the nerves supplying the tail and part of the rectum and\r\nmuscles belonging thereto. This fracture would not be suspected were it\r\nnot for the loss of motion of the tail.\r\n\r\nINTESTINAL PARALYSIS.--Characterized by persistent constipation;\r\nfrequently the strongest purgatives have no effect whatever on the\r\nmovement of the bowels. In the absence of symptoms of indigestion, or\r\nspecial diseases implicating the intestinal canal, torpor of the bowels\r\nmust be attributed to deficient innervation. This condition may depend\r\nupon brain affections or be due to reflex paralysis. Sudden checks of\r\nperspiration may induce excessive action of the bowels or paralysis.\r\n\r\nPARALYSIS OF THE BLADDER.--This usually affects the neck of the bladder,\r\nand is characterized by incontinence of urine; the urine dribbles away\r\nas fast as it is secreted. The cause may be of reflex origin, disease\r\nof the rectum, tumors growing within the pelvic cavity, injury to the\r\nspinal cord, etc.\r\n\r\nPARALYSIS OF THE OPTIC NERVE (AMAUROSIS).--A paralysis of eyesight may\r\noccur very suddenly from rupture of a blood vessel in the brain, acute\r\nlocal congestion of the brain, the administration of excessive doses of\r\nbelladonna or its alkaloid atropia, etc. In amaurosis the pupil is\r\ndilated to its full extent; the eye looks clear, but does not respond to\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nParalysis of hearing, of the external ear, of the eyelid, partial\r\nparalysis of the heart and organs of respiration, of the blood vessels\r\nfrom injury to the vasomotor nerves of the esophagus, or loss of\r\ndeglutition, palsy of the stomach, all may be manifested when the supply\r\nof nervous influence is impaired or suspended.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT FOR PARALYSIS.--In all paralytic affections there may be\r\nanesthesia, or impairment of sensibility, in addition to the loss of\r\nmotion, or there may be hyperesthesia, or increased sensibility, in\r\nconnection with the loss of motion. These conditions may call for\r\nspecial treatment in addition to that for loss of motion. If\r\nhyperesthesia is well marked local anodynes may be needed to relieve\r\nsuffering. Chloroform liniment or hypodermic injections of from 3 to 5\r\ngrains of sulphate of morphia will allay local pain. If there is marked\r\nanesthesia, or loss of sensibility, it may become necessary to secure\r\nthe animal in such way that he can not suffer serious injury from\r\naccidents which he can not avoid or feel. In the treatment of any form\r\nof paralysis we must always refer to the cause, and attempt its removal\r\nif it can be discovered. In cases in which the cause can not be\r\ndetermined we have to rely solely upon a general external and internal\r\ntreatment. Externally, fly blisters or strong, irritant liniments may be\r\napplied to the paralyzed parts. In hemiplegia they should be applied\r\nalong the bony part of the side of the neck; in paraplegia, across the\r\nloins. In, some cases hot-water cloths will be beneficial. Internally,\r\nit is well to administer 1 dram of powdered nux vomica or 2 grains of\r\nsulphate of strychnia twice a day until twitching of some of the\r\nvoluntary muscles occurs; then discontinue it for several days, and then\r\ncommence again with a smaller dose, gradually increasing it until\r\ntwitching recurs. Iodid of potassium in 1 to 2 dram doses two or three\r\ntimes daily may be used with the hope that it will favor the absorption\r\nof the clot or obstruction to the nervous current. In some cases\r\nFowler's solution of arsenic in teaspoonful doses twice a day in the\r\ndrinking water proves beneficial. Occasionally benefit may be derived\r\nfrom the application of the electric current, especially in cases of\r\nroaring, facial paralysis, paralysis of the eyelid, etc. Nutritious but\r\nnot too bulky feed, good ventilation, clean stabling, moderate exercise\r\nif the animal is capable of taking it, good grooming, etc., should be\r\nobserved in all cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPINAL MENINGITIS, OR INFLAMMATION OF THE MEMBRANES ENVELOPING THE\r\nSPINAL CORD.\r\n\r\nThis may be induced by the irritant properties of blood poisons,\r\nexhaustion and exposure, spinal concussion, all forms of injury to the\r\nspine, tumors, caries of the vertebrae, rheumatism, etc.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--A chill may be the precursor, a rise in temperature, or a\r\ngeneral weakness and shifting of the legs. Soon a painful, convulsive\r\ntwitching of the muscles sets in, followed by muscular rigidity along\r\nthe spine, in which condition the animal will move very stiffly and\r\nevince great pain in turning. Evidences of paralysis or paraplegia\r\ndevelop, retention or incontinence of urine, and oftentimes sexual\r\nexcitement is present. The presence of marked fever at the beginning of\r\nthe attack, associated with spinal symptoms, should lead us to suspect\r\nspinal meningitis or myelitis. These two conditions usually appear\r\ntogether, or myelitis follows inflammation of the meninges so closely\r\nthat it is almost impossible to separate the two; practically it does\r\nnot matter much, for the treatment will be about the same in both cases.\r\nSpinal meningitis generally becomes chronic, and is then marked\r\nprincipally by paralysis of that portion, or parts of it, posterior to\r\nthe seat of the disease.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._--In spinal meningitis we find essentially the same\r\ncondition as in cerebral meningitis; there is an effusion of serum\r\nbetween the membranes, and often a plastic exudation firmly adherent to\r\nthe pia mater serves to maintain a state of paralysis for a long time\r\nafter the acute symptoms have disappeared by compressing the cord.\r\nFinally, atrophy, softening, and even abscess may develop within the\r\ncord. Unlike in man, it is usually found localized in horses.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Bags filled with ice should be applied along the spine, to\r\nbe followed later by strong blisters. The fever should be controlled as\r\nearly as possible by giving 20 drops of Norwood's tincture of veratrum\r\nviride every hour until the desired result is obtained. One dram of the\r\nfluid extract of belladonna, to control pain and vascular excitement of\r\nthe spinal cord, may be given every five or six hours until the pupils\r\nof the eyes become pretty well dilated. If the pain is very intense 5\r\ngrains of sulphate of morphia should be injected hypodermically. The\r\nanimal must be kept as free from excitement as possible. If the urine is\r\nretained in the bladder it must be drawn off every four or six hours. In\r\nvery acute attacks the disease generally proves fatal in a few days. If,\r\nhowever, the animal grows better, some form of paralysis is liable to\r\nremain for a long time, and the treatment will have to be directed then\r\ntoward a removal of the exudative products and a strengthening of the\r\nsystem and stimulation of the nervous functions. To induce absorption,\r\niodid of potassium in 2-dram doses, dissolved in the drinking water, may\r\nbe given twice a day. To strengthen the system, iodid of iron 1 dram\r\ntwice a day and 1 dram of nux vomica once a day may be given in the\r\nfeed. Electricity to the paralyzed and weakened muscles is advisable;\r\nthe current should be weak, but be continued for half an hour two or\r\nthree times daily. If the disease is due to a broken back, caries of the\r\nvertebrae, or some other irremediable cause, the animal should be\r\ndestroyed at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nMYELITIS, OR INFLAMMATION OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE SPINAL CORD.\r\n\r\nThis is a rare disease, except as a secondary result of spinal\r\nmeningitis or injuries to the spine. Poisoning by lead, arsenic,\r\nmercury, phosphorus, carbonic-acid gas, etc., has been known to produce\r\nit. Myelitis may be confined to a small spot in the cord or may involve\r\nthe whole for a variable distance. It may lead to softening abscess or\r\ndegeneration.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The attack may begin with a chill or convulsion; the\r\nmuscles twitch or become cramped very early in the disease, and the\r\nbladder usually is affected at the outset, in which there may be either\r\nretention or incontinence of urine. These conditions are followed by\r\ncomplete or partial paralysis of the muscles posterior to the locality\r\nof the inflamed cord, and the muscles begin to waste away rapidly. The\r\nparalyzed limb becomes cold and dry, due to the suspension of proper\r\ncirculation; the joints may swell and become edematous; vesicular\r\neruptions appear on the skin; and frequently gangrenous sloughs form on\r\nthe paralyzed parts. It is exceedingly seldom that recovery takes place.\r\nIn a few instances it may assume a chronic type, when all the symptoms\r\nbecome mitigated, and thus continue for some time, until septicemia,\r\npyemia, or exhaustion causes death.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._--The inflammation may involve nearly the whole length of\r\nthe cord, but generally it is more intense in some places than others;\r\nwhen due to mechanical injury, the inflammation may remain confined to a\r\nsmall section. The cord is swollen and congested, reddened, often\r\nsoftened and infiltrated with pus cells, and the nerve elements are\r\ndegenerated.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Similar to that of spinal meningitis.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPINAL CONGESTION.\r\n\r\nThis condition consists in an excess of blood. As the blood vessels of\r\nthe pia mater are the principal source of supply to the spinal cord,\r\nhyperemia of the cord and of the meninges usually go together. The\r\nsymptoms are, therefore, closely allied to those of spinal meningitis\r\nand congestion. When the pia mater is diseased, the spinal cord is\r\nalmost invariably affected also.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--Sudden checking of the perspiration, violent exercise, blows,\r\nand falls.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms may vary somewhat with each case, and closely\r\nresemble the first symptoms of spinal meningitis, spinal tumors, and\r\nmyelitis. First, some disturbance in movement, lowering the temperature,\r\nand partial loss of sensibility posterior to the seat of the congestion.\r\nIf in the cervical region, it may cause interference in breathing and\r\nthe action of the heart. When in the region of the loins, there may be\r\nloss of control of the bladder. When the congestion is sufficient to\r\nproduce compression of the cord, paraplegia may be complete. Usually\r\nfever, spasms, muscular twitching, or muscular rigidity are absent,\r\nwhich will serve to distinguish spinal congestion from spinal\r\nmeningitis.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Hot-water applications to the spine, 1-dram doses fluid\r\nextract of belladonna repeated every four hours, and tincture of aconite\r\nroot 20 drops every hour until the symptoms become ameliorated. If no\r\ninflammatory products occur, the animal is likely to recover.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPINAL ANEMIA.\r\n\r\nThis may be caused by extreme cold, exhausting diseases, spinal embolism\r\nor plugging of a spinal blood vessel, an interference with the\r\ncirculation through the abdominal aorta, from compression, thrombosis,\r\nor aneurism of that vessel; the spinal vessels may be caused to contract\r\nthrough vasomotor influence, a result of peripheral irritation of some\r\nnerve.\r\n\r\nSpinal anemia causes paralysis of the muscles used in extending the\r\nlimbs. When the bladder is affected, it precedes the weakness of motion,\r\nwhile in spinal congestion it follows, and increased sensibility, in\r\nplace of diminished sensibility, as in spinal congestion, is observed.\r\nPressure along the spine causes excessive pain.\r\n\r\nIf the exciting cause can be removed, the animal recovers; if this\r\nfails, the spinal cord may undergo softening.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPINAL COMPRESSION.\r\n\r\nWhen caused by tumors or otherwise, when pressure is slight, it produces\r\na paralysis of the muscles used in extending a limb and contraction of\r\nthose which flex it. When compression is great it causes complete loss\r\nof sensibility and motion posterior to the compressed part of the cord.\r\n\r\nCompression of a lateral half of the cord produces motor paralysis,\r\ndisturbance of the circulation, and difficulty of movement, an increased\r\nsensibility on the side corresponding to the compressed section, and a\r\ndiminished sensibility and some paralysis on the opposite side.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--When it occurs as a sequence of a preceding inflammatory\r\ndisease, iodid of potassium and general tonics are indicated. When due\r\nto tumors growing within the spinal canal, or to pressure from displaced\r\nbone, no form of treatment will result in any benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPINAL HEMORRHAGE.\r\n\r\nThis may occur from changes in the wall of the blood vessels, in\r\nconnection with tumors, acute myelitis, traumatic injuries, etc. The\r\nblood may escape through the pia mater into the subarachnoid cavity, and\r\nlarge clots be formed.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are largely dependent upon the seat and extent\r\nof the hemorrhage, as they are principally owing to the compression of\r\nthe cord. A large clot may produce sudden paraplegia, accompanied with\r\nsevere pain along the spine; usually, however, the paralysis of both\r\nmotion and sensation is not very marked at first; on the second or third\r\nday fever is liable to appear, and increased or diminished sensibility\r\nalong the spine posterior to the seat of the clot. When the bladder and\r\nrectum are involved in the symptoms it indicates that the spinal cord is\r\ncompressed.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In the occurrence of injuries to the back of a horse,\r\nwhenever there is any evidence of paralysis, it is always advisable to\r\napply bags of ice along the spine to check or prevent hemorrhage or\r\ncongestion, and 2 drams of the fluid extract of ergot and 20 drops of\r\ntincture of digitalis may be given every hour until three doses have\r\nbeen taken. Subsequently tincture of belladonna in half-ounce doses may\r\nbe given three times a day. If there is much pain, 5 grains of sulphate\r\nof morphia, injected under the skin, will afford relief and lessen the\r\nexcitability of the animal. In all cases the animal should be kept\r\nperfectly quiet.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPINAL CONCUSSION.\r\n\r\nThis is rarely observed in the horse, and unless it is sufficiently\r\nsevere to produce well-marked symptoms it would not be suspected. It may\r\noccur in saddle horses from jumping, or it may be produced by falling\r\nover an embankment, or a violent fall upon the haunches may produce it.\r\nConcussion may be followed by partial paralysis or spinal hemorrhage;\r\ngenerally, however, it is confined to a jarring and some disturbance of\r\nthe nerve elements of the cord, and the paralytic effect which ensues\r\nsoon passes off. Treatment consists in rest until the animal has\r\ncompletely recovered from the shock. If secondary effects follow from\r\nhemorrhage or compression, they have to be treated as heretofore\r\ndirected.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPINAL TUMORS.\r\n\r\nWithin the substance of the cord glioma or the mixed gliosarcomata are\r\nfound to be the most frequent, tumors may form from the meninges and the\r\nvertebrae, being of a fibrous or bony nature, and affect the spinal cord\r\nindirectly by compression. In the meninges we may find glioma, cancers,\r\nand psammoma, fibromata; aneurisms of the spinal arteries have been\r\ndiscovered in the spinal canal.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Tumors of the spinal canal cause symptoms of spinal\r\nirritation or compression of the cord. The gradual and slow development\r\nof symptoms of paralysis of one or both hind limbs or certain muscles\r\nmay lead to a suspicion of spinal tumors. The paralysis induced is\r\nprogressive, but not usually marked with atrophy of the muscles or\r\nincreased sensibility along the spine. When the tumor is within the\r\nspinal cord itself all the symptoms of myelitis may be present.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--General tonics and 1-dram doses of nux vomica may be\r\ngiven; iodid of iron or iodid of potassium in 1-dram doses, three times\r\na day in feed, may, in a very few cases, give some temporary benefit.\r\nUsually the disease progresses steadily until it proves fatal.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEURITIS, OR INFLAMMATION OF A NERVE.\r\n\r\nThis is caused by a bruise or wound of a nerve or by strangulation in a\r\nligature when the nerve is included in the ligation of an artery. The\r\nchanges in an inflamed nerve are an enlargement, reddening of the nerve\r\nsheath, spots of extravasated blood, and sometimes an infiltration of\r\nserum mixed with pus.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Acute pain of the parts supplied by the nerve and absence\r\nof swelling or increased heat of the part.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Hypodermic injections of from 3 to 5 grains of morphia to\r\nrelieve pain, hot fomentations, and rest. If it is due to an inclusion\r\nof a ligature, the nerve should be divided above and below the ligature.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEUROMA, OR TUMOR OF A NERVE.\r\n\r\nNeuroma may be from enlargement of the end of a divided nerve or due to\r\nfibrous degeneration of a nerve which has been bruised or wounded. Its\r\nmost frequent occurrence is found after the operation of neurotomy for\r\nfoot lameness, and it may appear after the lapse of months or even\r\nyears. Neuroma usually develops within the sheath of the nerve with or\r\nwithout implicating the nerve fibers. It is oval, running lengthwise\r\nwith the direction of the nerve.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Pain of the affected limb or part is manifested, more\r\nespecially after resting a while, and when pressure is made upon the\r\ntumor it causes extreme suffering.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Excision of the tumor, including part of the nerve above\r\nand below, and then treat it like any other simple wound.\r\n\r\n\r\nINJURIES TO NERVES.\r\n\r\nThese may consist in wounding, bruising, laceration, stretching,\r\ncompression, etc. The symptoms which are produced will depend upon the\r\nextent, seat, and character of the injury. Recovery may quickly take\r\nplace, or it may lead to neuritis, neuroma, or spinal or cerebral\r\nirritation, which may result in tetanus, paralysis, and other serious\r\nderangements. In all diseases, whether produced by some form of external\r\nviolence or intrinsic causes, the nerves are necessarily involved, and\r\nsometimes it is to a primary injury of them that the principal fault in\r\nmovement or change of nutrition of a part is due. It is often difficult\r\nor impossible to discover that an injury to a nerve has been inflicted,\r\nbut whenever this is possible it may enable us to remedy that which\r\notherwise would result in permanent evil. Treatment should consist in\r\nrelieving compression, in hot fomentations, the application of anodyne\r\nliniments, excision of the injured part, and rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORAGE POISONING, OR SO-CALLED CEREBROSPINAL MENINGITIS.\r\n\r\nThis disease prevails among horses in nearly all parts of the United\r\nStates. Its appearance in America is by no means of recent occurrence,\r\nfor the malady was reported by Large in 1847, by Michener in 1850, and\r\nby Liautard in 1869 as appearing in both sporadic and enzootic form in\r\nseveral of the Eastern States. Since then the disease has occurred\r\nperiodically in many States in all sections of the country, and has been\r\nthe subject of numerous investigations and publications by a number of\r\nthe leading men of the veterinary profession. It is prevalent with more\r\nor less severity every year in certain parts of the United States, and\r\nduring the year 1912 the Bureau of Animal Industry received urgent\r\nrequests for help from Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,\r\nLouisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Carolina,\r\nOregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Virginia, and West Virginia. While\r\nin 1912 the brunt of the disease seemed to fall on Kansas and Nebraska,\r\nother States were also seriously afflicted. In previous years, for\r\ninstance in 1882, as well as in 1897, the horses of southeastern Texas\r\nwere reported to have died by the thousand, and in the following year\r\nthe horses of Iowa were said to have \"died like rats.\" However, Kansas\r\nseems to have had more than her share of this trouble, as a severe\r\noutbreak that extended over almost the entire State occurred in 1891,\r\nwhile in 1902 and again in 1906 the disease recurred with equal severity\r\nin various portions of the State.\r\n\r\nThis condition consists in a poisoning and depression of the nervous\r\nsystem from eating or drinking feed or water containing poison generated\r\nby mold or bacteria. It has been shown to be owing to eating damaged\r\nensilage, corn, brewers' grains, oats, etc., or to drinking stagnant\r\npond water or water from a well contaminated by surface drainage. Horses\r\nat pasture may contract the disease when the growth of grass is so\r\nprofuse that it mats together and the lower part dies and ferments or\r\nbecomes moldy.\r\n\r\nIn England a similar disease has been called \"grass staggers,\" due to\r\neating rye grass when it is ripening or when it is cut and eaten while\r\nit is heating and undergoing fermentation. In eastern Pennsylvania it\r\nwas formerly known by the name of \"putrid sore throat\" and \"choking\r\ndistemper.\" A disease similar in many respects which is very prevalent\r\nin Virgina, especially along the eastern border, is commonly known by\r\nthe name of \"blind staggers,\" and in many of the Southern States this\r\nhas been attributed to the consumption of worm-eaten, corn. Horses of\r\nall ages and mules are subject to this disease.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms and lesions._--The symptoms which typify sporadic or epidemic\r\ncerebrospinal meningitis in man are not witnessed among horses, namely,\r\nexcessive pain, high fever, and early muscular rigidity. In the\r\nrecognition of the severity of the attack we may divide the symptoms\r\ninto three grades. In the most rapidly fatal attacks the animal may\r\nfirst indicate it by weak, staggering gait, partial or total inability\r\nto swallow solids or liquids, impairment of eyesight; twitching of the\r\nmuscles and slight cramps may be observed. As a rule, the temperature is\r\nnot elevated--indeed, it is sometimes below normal. This is soon\r\nfollowed by a paralysis of the whole body, inability to stand, delirium\r\nin which the animal sometimes goes through a series of automatic\r\nmovements as if trotting or running; the delirium may become very\r\nviolent and the unconscious animal may bruise his head very seriously in\r\nhis struggles; but usually a deep coma renders him quiet until he\r\nexpires. Death in these cases usually takes place in from 4 to 24 hours\r\nfrom the time the first symptoms become manifest. The pulse is variable\r\nduring the progress of the disease; it may be almost imperceptible at\r\ntimes, and then again very rapid and irregular; the respirations\r\ngenerally are quick and catching. In the next form in which this disease\r\nmay develop it first becomes manifest by a difficulty in swallowing and\r\nslowness in mastication, and a weakness which may be first noticed in\r\nthe strength of the tail; the animal will be unable to switch it or to\r\noffer resistance when we bend it up over the croup. The pulse is often a\r\nlittle slower than normal. There is no evidence of pain; the\r\nrespirations are unchanged, and the temperature little less than normal;\r\nthe bowels may be somewhat constipated. These symptoms may remain\r\nunchanged for two or three days and then gradual improvement may take\r\nplace, or the power to swallow may become entirely lost and the weakness\r\nand uncertainty in gait more and more perceptible; then sleepiness or\r\ncoma may appear; the pulse becomes depressed, slow, and weak, the\r\nbreathing stertorous, and paroxysms of delirium develop, with inability\r\nto stand, and some rigidity of the spinal muscles or partial cramp of\r\nthe neck and jaws. In such cases death may occur in from 6 to 10 days\r\nfrom the commencement of the attack. In many cases there is no evidence\r\nof pain, spasm, or fever at any time during the progress of the disease,\r\nand finally profound coma develops and death follows, painless and\r\nwithout a struggle.\r\n\r\nIn the last or mildest form the inability of voluntary control of the\r\nlimbs becomes but slightly marked, the power of swallowing never\r\nentirely lost, and the animal has no fever, pain, or unconscious\r\nmovements. Generally the animal will begin to improve about the fourth\r\nday and recovers.\r\n\r\nIn a few cases the spinal symptoms, manifested by paraplegia, may be the\r\nmost prominent symptoms; in others they may be altogether absent and the\r\nmain symptoms may be difficulty in mastication and swallowing; rarely it\r\nmay affect one limb only. In all cases in which coma remains absent for\r\nsix or seven days the animal is likely to recover. When changes toward\r\nrecovery take place, the symptoms usually leave in the reverse order to\r\nthat in which they developed, but local paralysis may remain for some\r\ntime, rarely persistent.\r\n\r\nOn post-mortem the number of lesions observable to the naked eye is in\r\nmarked contrast to the severity of the symptoms noted. The pharynx and\r\nlarynx are inflamed in many cases, and sometimes coated with a\r\nyellowish-white glutinous deposit, extending at times over the tongue\r\nand occasionally a little way down the trachea. The lungs are normal,\r\nexcept from complications following drenching or recumbence for a long\r\nperiod. The heart is usually normal in appearance, except an occasional\r\ncluster of hemorrhagic points on the outer surface, while the blood is\r\ndark and firmly coagulated. The lining of the stomach indicates a\r\nsubacute gastritis, while occasionally an erosion is noted. An edema is\r\nobserved in the submucosa of such cases. The first few inches of the\r\nsmall intestines likewise may show slight inflammation in certain cases,\r\nwhile in others it is quite severe; otherwise the digestive tract\r\nappears normal, excluding the presence of varying numbers of bots,\r\n_Strongylus vulgatus_, and a few other nematodes. The liver is congested\r\nand swollen in some cases, while it appears normal in others. The spleen\r\nis, as a rule, normal, and at times the kidneys are slightly congested.\r\nThe bladder is often distended with dark-colored urine, and occasionally\r\na marked cystitis has been observed. The adipose tissue throughout the\r\ncarcass may show a pronounced icteric appearance in certain cases. On\r\nremoving the bones of the skull the brain appears to be normal\r\nmacroscopically in a few instances, but in most cases the veins and\r\ncapillaries of the meninges of the cerebrum, cerebellum, and\r\noccasionally the medulla is distinctly dilated and engorged, and in a\r\nfew cases there are pronounced lesions of a leptomeningitis. An\r\nexcessive quantity of cerebrospinal fluid is present in most of the\r\ncases. On the floor of the lateral ventricles of several brains there\r\nwas noted a slight softening caused by hemorrhages into the brain\r\nsubstance. There is always an abundance of fluid in the subarachnoid\r\nspaces, ventricles, and at the base of the brain, usually of the color\r\nof diabetic urine, and containing a limited number of flocculi, but in a\r\nfew cases it was slightly blood tinged. The spinal cord was not found\r\ninvolved in the few cases examined.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--One attack of the disease does not confer immunity. Horses\r\nhave been observed which have recovered from two attacks, and still\r\nothers that recovered from the first but died as a result of the second\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as a natural immunity does not appear after an attack of\r\ncerebrospinal meningitis, it might be anticipated that serum of\r\nrecovered cases would possess neither curative nor prophylactic\r\nqualities. Nevertheless, experiments have been made along these lines\r\nwith serum from recovered cases, but without any positive results.\r\nSimilar investigations have been conducted by others in Europe with\r\nprecisely the same results. With the tendency of the disease to produce\r\npathological lesions in the central nervous system, it seems scarcely\r\nimaginable that a medicinal remedy will be found to heal these foci, and\r\neven when recovery takes place considerable disturbance in the\r\nfunctions, as blindness, partial paralysis, dumbness, etc., is liable to\r\nremain. Indeed, when the disease once becomes established in an animal,\r\ndrugs seem to lose their physiological action. Therefore, with all the\r\npreviously mentioned facts before us, it is evident that the first\r\nprinciple in the treatment of this disease is prevention, which consists\r\nin the exercise of proper care in feeding only clean, well-cured forage\r\nand grain and pure water. These measures when faithfully carried out\r\ncheck the development of additional cases of the disease upon the\r\naffected premises.\r\n\r\nWhile medicinal treatment has proved unsatisfactory in most cases,\r\nnevertheless the first indication is to clean out the digestive tract\r\nthoroughly, and to accomplish this prompt measures must be used early in\r\nthe disease. Active and concentrated remedies should be given,\r\npreferably subcutaneously or intravenously, owing to the great\r\ndifficulty in swallowing, even in the early stage. Arecolin in one-half\r\ngrain doses, subcutaneously, has given as much satisfaction as any other\r\ndrug. After purging the animal the treatment is mostly symptomatic.\r\nIntestinal disinfectants, particularly calomel, salol, and salicylic\r\nacid, have been recommended, and mild, antiseptic mouth washes are\r\nadvisable. Antipyretics are of doubtful value, as better results are\r\nobtained, if the temperature is high, by copious cold-water injections.\r\nAn ice pack applied to the head is beneficial in case of marked psychic\r\ndisturbance. One-ounce doses of chloral hydrate per rectum should be\r\ngiven if the patient is violent or if muscular spasms are severe. If the\r\ntemperature becomes subnormal, the animal should be warmly blanketed,\r\nand if much weakness is shown this should be combated with stimulants,\r\nsuch as strychnin, camphor, alcohol, atropin, or aromatic spirits of\r\nammonia. Early in the disease urotropin (hexamethylenamin) in doses of\r\n25 grains, dissolved in water and given by the mouth every two hours,\r\nappeared to have been responsible for the recovery of some cases of the\r\nmalady. During convalescence tonic treatment is indicated.\r\n\r\n_Hygienic measures needful._--Whenever this disease appears in a stable\r\nall the animals should be removed as soon as possible. They should be\r\nprovided with clean, well-ventilated, and well-drained stables, and each\r\nanimal should receive a laxative and be fed feed and given water from a\r\nnew, clean source. The abandoned stable should be thoroughly cleansed\r\nfrom all waste matters, receive a coat of whitewash containing 4 ounces\r\nof carbolic acid to the gallon of water and should have time to dry\r\nthoroughly before the horses are replaced. A complete change of feed is\r\nof the very greatest importance on account of the belief that the cause\r\nresides in diseased grain, hay, and grass.\r\n\r\n\r\nTETANUS, OR LOCKJAW.\r\n\r\nThis disease is characterized by spasms affecting the muscles of the\r\nface, neck, body, and limbs and of all muscles supplied by the\r\ncerebrospinal nerves. The spasms or muscular contractions are rigid and\r\npersistent, yet mixed with occasional more intense contractions of\r\nconvulsive violence.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--This disease is caused by a bacillus that is often found in\r\nthe soil, in manure, and in dust. This germ forms spores at the end of\r\nthe organism and grows only in the absence of oxygen. It produces a\r\npowerful nerve poison, which causes the symptoms of tetanus. The germ\r\nitself multiplies at the point where it is introduced, but its poison is\r\nabsorbed and is carried by the blood to all parts of the body, and thus\r\nthe nervous system is poisoned. Deep wounds infected by this germ are\r\nmore dangerous than superficial wounds, because in them the germ is more\r\nremote from the oxygen of the air. Hence, nail pricks, etc., are\r\nespecially dangerous. In the majority of instances the cause of tetanus\r\ncan be traced to wounds, especially pricks and wounds of the feet or of\r\ntendinous structures. It sometimes follows castration, docking, the\r\nintroduction of setons, inclusion of a nerve in a ligature, etc. It may\r\ncome on a long time after the wound is healed--three or four months.\r\nHorses with a nervous, excitable disposition are more predisposed than\r\nthose of a more sluggish nature. Stallions are more subject to develop\r\ntetanus as the result of wounds than geldings, and geldings more than\r\nmares.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The attacks may be acute or subacute. In an acute attack\r\nthe animal usually dies within four days. The first symptoms which\r\nattract the attention of the owner is difficulty in chewing and\r\nswallowing, an extension of the head and protrusion over the inner part\r\nof the eye of the membrana nictitans, or haw. An examination of the\r\nmouth will reveal an inability to open the jaws to their full extent,\r\nand the endeavor to do so will produce great nervous excitability and\r\nincreased spasm of the muscles of the jaw and neck. The muscles of the\r\nneck and along the spine become rigid and the legs are moved in a stiff\r\nmanner. The slightest noise or disturbance throws the animal into\r\nincreased spasm of all the affected muscles. The tail is usually\r\nelevated and held immovable; the bowels become constipated early in the\r\nattack. The temperature and pulse are not much changed. These symptoms\r\nin the acute type become rapidly aggravated until all the muscles are\r\nrigid--in a state of tonic spasm--with a continuous tremor running\r\nthrough them; a cold perspiration breaks out on the body; the breathing\r\nbecomes painful from the spasm of the muscles used in respiration; the\r\njaws are completely set, eyeballs retracted, lips drawn tightly over the\r\nteeth, nostrils dilated, and the animal presents a picture of the most\r\nextreme agony until death relieves him. The pulse, which at first was\r\nnot much affected, will become quick and hard, or small and thready when\r\nthe spasm affects the muscles of the heart. In the subacute cases the\r\njaws may never become entirely locked; the nervous excitability and\r\nrigidity of the muscles are not so great. There is, however, always some\r\nstiffness of the neck or spine manifest in turning; the haw is turned\r\nover the eyeball when the nose is elevated. It is not uncommon for\r\nowners to continue such animals at their work for several days after the\r\nfirst symptoms have been observed. All the symptoms may gradually\r\nincrease in severity for a period of ten days, and then gradually\r\ndiminish under judicious treatment, or they may reach the stage wherein\r\nall the characteristics of acute tetanus become developed. In some\r\ncases, however, we find the muscular cramps almost solely confined to\r\nthe head or face, perhaps involving those of the neck. In such cases we\r\nhave complete trismus (lockjaw), and all the head symptoms are acutely\r\ndeveloped. On the contrary, we may find the head almost exempt in some\r\ncases, and have the body and limbs perfectly rigid and incapable of\r\nmovement without falling.\r\n\r\nTetanus may possibly be confounded with spinal meningitis, but the\r\ncharacter of the spasm-locked jaw, retraction of the eyeballs, the\r\ndifficulty in swallowing due to spasms of the muscles of the pharynx,\r\nand above all, the absence of paralysis, should serve to make the\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--When a valuable horse has sustained a wound that it is\r\nfeared may be followed by tetanus, it is well to administer a dose of\r\ntetanus antitoxin. This is injected beneath the skin with a hypodermic\r\nsyringe. A very high degree of protection may in this way be afforded.\r\nThis antitoxin should be administered only by a competent veterinarian.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The animal should be placed in a box stall without\r\nbedding, as far as possible from other horses. If in a country district,\r\nthe animal should be put into an outbuilding or shed, where the noise of\r\nother animals will not reach it; if the place is moderately dark, it is\r\nall the better; in fly time it should be covered with a light sheet. The\r\nattendant must be very careful and quiet to prevent all unnecessary\r\nexcitement and increase of spasm. Tetanus antitoxin appears to be useful\r\nas a remedy in some cases, if given in very large quantities early in\r\nthe disease; otherwise it is useless. Subcutaneous injections of\r\ncarbolic acid in glycerin and water (carbolic acid 30 grains, glycerin\r\nand water each 1 ounce) appear to be useful in some cases. Injections\r\nshould be given twice daily.\r\n\r\nA cathartic, composed of Barbados aloes 6 to 8 drams, with which may be\r\nmixed 2 drams of the solid extract of belladonna, should be given at\r\nonce. This is best given in a ball form; if, however, the animal is\r\ngreatly excited by the attempt or can not swallow, the ball may be\r\ndissolved in 2 ounces of olive oil and thrown on the back of the tongue\r\nwith a syringe. If the jaws are set, or nearly so, an attempt to\r\nadminister medicine by the mouth should not be made. In such cases\r\none-quarter of a grain of atropia, with 5 grains of sulphate of morphia,\r\nshould be dissolved in 1 dram of pure water and injected under the skin.\r\nThis should be repeated sufficiently often to keep the animal\r\ncontinually under its effect. This will usually mitigate the severity of\r\nthe spasmodic contraction of the affected muscles and lessen sensibility\r\nto pain. Good results may be obtained sometimes by the rectal injection\r\nof the fluid extract of belladonna and of cannabis indica, of each 1\r\ndram, every four or six hours. This may be diluted with a quart of milk.\r\nWhen the animal is unable to swallow liquids, oatmeal gruel and milk\r\nshould be given by injection per rectum to sustain the strength of the\r\nanimal. A pailful of cool water should be constantly before him, placed\r\nhigh enough for him to reach it without special effort; even if drinking\r\nis impossible, the laving of the mouth is refreshing. Excellent success\r\nfrequently may be obtained by clothing the upper part of the head, the\r\nneck, and greater part of the body in woolen blankets kept saturated\r\nwith very warm water. This treatment should be continued for six or\r\neight hours at a time. It often relaxes the cramped muscles and gives\r\nthem rest and the animal almost entire freedom from pain; but it should\r\nbe used every day until the acute spasms have permanently subsided in\r\norder to be of any lasting benefit.\r\n\r\nRecently subcutaneous injections of brain emulsion have been\r\nrecommended. It is thought that the tetanus toxin will attach itself to\r\nthe brain cells so injected and thus free the system of this poison.\r\nWhen it is due to a wound, the wound should be thoroughly cleaned and\r\ndisinfected with carbolic acid. If from a wound which has healed, an\r\nexcision of the cicatrix may be beneficial. In all cases it is not\r\nuncommon to have a partial recovery followed by relapse when the animal\r\nbecomes excited from any cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nRABIES, HYDROPHOBIA, OR MADNESS.\r\n\r\nThis disease does not arise spontaneously among horses, but is the\r\nresult of a bite from a rabid animal--generally a dog or cat. The\r\ndevelopment of the disease follows the bite in from three weeks to three\r\nmonths--very rarely in two weeks. (See also p. 559.)\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The first manifestation of the development of this disease\r\nmay be an increased excitability and viciousness; very slight noises or\r\nthe approach of a person incites the animal to kick, strike, or bite at\r\nany near object. Very often the horse will bite his own limbs or sides,\r\nlacerating the flesh and tearing the skin. The eyes appear staring,\r\nbloodshot; the ears are on the alert to catch all sounds; the head is\r\nheld erect. In some cases the animal will continually rub and bite the\r\nlocality of the wound inflicted by the rabid animal. This symptom may\r\nprecede all others. Generally the bowels become constipated and the\r\nanimal makes frequent attempts at urination, which is painful, and the\r\nurine very dark colored. The furious symptoms appear in paroxysms; at\r\nother times the animal may eat and drink, although swallowing appears to\r\nbecome painful toward the latter stage of the disease, and may cause\r\nrenewed paroxysms. The muscles of the limbs or back may be subject to\r\nintermittent spasms, or spasmodic tremors; finally, the hind limbs\r\nbecome paralyzed, breathing very difficult, and convulsions supervene,\r\nfollowed by death. The pulse and respirations are increased in frequency\r\nfrom the outset of the attack. Rabies may possibly be mistaken for\r\ntetanus. In the latter disease we find tonic spasms of the muscles of\r\nthe jaws, or stiffness of the neck or back very early in the attack, and\r\nevidence of viciousness is absent.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--As soon as the true nature of the disease is ascertained\r\nthe animal should be killed.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--When a horse is known to have been bitten by a rabid\r\nanimal, immediate cauterization of the wound with a red-hot iron may\r\npossibly destroy the virus before absorption of it takes place.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLUMBISM, OR LEAD POISONING.\r\n\r\nThis disease is not of frequent occurrence. It may be due to the\r\nhabitual drinking of water which has been standing in leaden conductors\r\nor in old paint barrels, etc. It has been met with in enzootic form near\r\nsmelting works, where, by the fumes arising from the works, lead in the\r\nform of oxid, carbonate, or sulphate was deposited on the grass and\r\nherbage which the horses ate.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Lead poisoning produces derangement of the functions of\r\ndigestion and locomotion, or it may affect the lungs principally. In\r\nwhatever system of organs the lead is mostly deposited there we have the\r\nsymptoms of nervous debility most manifest. If in the lungs, the\r\nbreathing becomes difficult and the animal gets out of breath very\r\nquickly when compelled to run. Roaring, also, is very frequently a\r\nsymptom of lead poisoning. When it affects the stomach, the animal\r\ngradually falls away in flesh, the hair becomes rough, the skin tight,\r\nand colicky symptoms develop. When the deposit is principally in the\r\nmuscles, partial or complete paralysis gradually develops. When large\r\nquantities of lead have been taken in and absorbed, symptoms resembling\r\nepilepsy may result, or coma and delirium develop and prove fatal. In\r\nlead poisoning there is seldom any increase in temperature. A blue line\r\nforms along the gums of the front teeth, and the breath assumes a\r\npeculiarly offensive odor. Lead can always be detected in the urine by\r\nchemical tests.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The administration of 2-dram doses of iodid of potassium\r\nthree times a day is indicated. This will form iodid of lead in the\r\nsystem, which is rapidly excreted by the kidneys. If much muscular\r\nweakness or paralysis is present, sulphate of iron in 1-dram doses and\r\nstrychnia in 2-grain doses may be given twice a day. In all cases of\r\nsuspected lead poisoning all utensils which have entered into the supply\r\nof feed or water should be examined for the presence of soluble lead. If\r\nit occurs near lead works, great care must be given to the supply of\r\nuncontaminated fodder, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nUREMIA.\r\n\r\nUremic poisoning may affect the brain in nephritis, acute albuminuria,\r\nor when, from any cause, the functions of the kidneys become impaired or\r\nsuppressed and urea (a natural product) is no longer eliminated from\r\nthese organs, causing it to accumulate in the system and give rise to\r\nuremic poisoning.\r\n\r\nUremic poisoning is usually preceded by dropsy of the limbs or abdomen;\r\na peculiar, fetid breath is often noticed; then drowsiness, attacks of\r\ndiarrhea, and general debility ensue. Suddenly extreme stupor or coma\r\ndevelops; the surface of the body becomes cold; the pupils are\r\ninsensible to light; the pulse slow and intermitting; the breathing\r\nlabored, and death supervenes. The temperature throughout the disease is\r\nseldom increased, unless the disease becomes complicated with acute,\r\ninflammatory disease of the brain or respiratory organs, which often\r\noccur as a result of the urea in the circulation. Albumen and tube casts\r\nmay frequently be found in the urine. The disease almost invariably\r\nproves fatal.\r\n\r\nTreatment must be directed to a removal of the cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRIC SHOCK.\r\n\r\nElectric shock, from coming in contact with electric wires, is becoming\r\na matter of rather frequent occurrence, and has a similar effect upon\r\nthe animal system as a shock from lightning. Two degrees of electric or\r\nlightning shock may be observed, one producing temporary contraction of\r\nmuscles and insensibility, from which recovery is possible, the other\r\nkilling directly, by producing a condition of nervous and general\r\ninsensibility. In shocks which are not immediately fatal the animal is\r\nusually insensible, the respiration slow, labored, or gasping, the pulse\r\nslow, feeble, and irregular, and the pupils dilated and not sensitive,\r\nor they may be contracted and sensitive. The temperature is lowered.\r\nThere may be a tendency to convulsions or spasms. The predominating\r\nsymptoms are extreme cardiac and respiratory depression.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Sulphate of atropia should be given hypodermically in\r\none-quarter grain doses every hour or two hours until the heart beats\r\nare invigorated, the number and fullness of the respirations increased,\r\nand consciousness returns. Stimulating injections per rectum may also be\r\nuseful in arousing the circulation; for this purpose whisky or ammonia\r\nwater may be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE HEART, BLOOD VESSELS, AND LYMPHATICS.\r\n\r\nBy M. R. TRUMBOWER, V. S.\r\n\r\n[Revised by Leonard Pearson, B. S., V. M. D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE HEART AND BLOOD VESSELS.\r\n\r\n(Pls. XX and XXI.)\r\n\r\nThe heart is a hollow, muscular organ, situated a little to the left of\r\nthe center of the chest. Its impulse is felt on the left side on account\r\nof its location and from the rotary movement of the organ in action. It\r\nis cone-shaped, with the base upward; the apex points downward,\r\nbackward, and to the left side. It extends from about the third to the\r\nsixth ribs, inclusive. The average weight is about 7 to 8 pounds. In\r\nhorses used for speed the heart is relatively larger, according to the\r\nweight of the animal, than in horses used for slow work. It is suspended\r\nfrom the spine by the large blood vessels and held in position below by\r\nthe attachment of the pericardium to the sternum. It is inclosed in a\r\nsac, the pericardium, which is composed of a dense fibrous membrane\r\nlined by a delicate serous membrane, which is reflected over the heart;\r\nthe inner layer is firmly adherent to the heart, the outer to the\r\nfibrous sac, and there is an intervening space, known as the pericardial\r\nspace, in which a small amount of serum--a thin translucent liquid--is\r\npresent constantly.\r\n\r\nThe heart is divided by a shallow fissure into a right and left side;\r\neach of these is again subdivided by a transverse partition into two\r\ncompartments which communicate. Thus there are four cardiac\r\ncavities--the superior, or upper, ones called the auricles; the\r\ninferior, or lower, ones the ventricles. These divisions are marked on\r\nthe outside by grooves, which contain the cardiac blood vessels, and are\r\ngenerally filled with fat.\r\n\r\nThe right side of the heart may be called the venous side, the left the\r\narterial side, named from the kind of blood which passes through them.\r\nThe auricles are thin-walled cavities placed at the base, and are\r\nconnected with the great veins--the venae cavae and pulmonary\r\nveins--through which they receive blood from all parts of the body. The\r\nauricles communicate with the ventricles each by a large aperture, the\r\nauriculo-ventricular orifice, which is furnished with a remarkable\r\nmechanism of valves, allowing the transmission of blood from the\r\nauricles into the ventricles, but preventing a reverse course. The\r\nventricles are thick-walled cavities, forming the more massive portion\r\nof the heart toward the apex. They are separated by a partition, and are\r\nconnected with the great arteries--the pulmonary artery and the\r\naorta--by which they send blood to all parts of the body. At the mouth\r\nof the aorta and at the mouth of the pulmonary artery is an arrangement\r\nof valves in each case which prevents the reflux of blood into the\r\nventricles. The auriculo-ventricular valve in the left side is composed\r\nof two flaps, hence it is called the bicuspid valve; in the right side\r\nthis valve has three flaps and is called the tricuspid valve. The flaps\r\nwhich form these valves are connected with a tendinous ring between the\r\nauricles and ventricles; and each flap of the auriculo-ventricular\r\nvalves is supplied with tendinous cords, which are attached to the free\r\nmargin and under-surface, so as to keep the valves tense when closed--a\r\ncondition which is produced by the shortening of muscular pillars with\r\nwhich the cords are connected. The arterial openings, both on the right\r\nand on the left side, are provided with three-flapped semilunar-shaped\r\nvalves, to prevent the regurgitation of blood when the ventricles\r\ncontract. The veins emptying into the auricles are not capable of\r\nclosure, but the posterior vena cava has an imperfect valve at its\r\naperture.\r\n\r\nThe inner surface of the heart is lined by a serous membrane, the\r\nendocardium, which is smooth and firmly adherent to the muscular\r\nstructure of the heart. This membrane is continuous with the lining\r\nmembrane of the blood vessels, and it enters into the formation of the\r\nvalves.\r\n\r\nThe circulation through the heart is as follows: The venous blood is\r\ncarried into the right auricle by the anterior and posterior venae cavae.\r\nIt then passes through the right auriculo-ventricular opening into the\r\nright ventricle, thence through the pulmonary artery to the lungs. It\r\nreturns by the pulmonary veins to the left auricle, then is forced\r\nthrough the auriculo-ventricular opening into the left ventricle, which\r\npropels it through the aorta and its branches into the system, the veins\r\nreturning it again to the heart. The circulation, therefore, is double,\r\nthe pulmonary, or lesser, being performed by the right side, and the\r\nsystemic, or greater, by the left side.\r\n\r\nAs the blood is forced through the heart by forcible contractions of its\r\nmuscular walls, it has the action of a force pump, and gives the impulse\r\nat each beat, which we call the pulse--the dilatation of the arteries\r\nthroughout the system. The contraction of the auricles is quickly\r\nfollowed by that of the ventricles, and then a slight pause occurs; this\r\ntakes place in regular rhythmical order during health.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XX.\r\n\r\nINTERIOR OF CHEST SHOWING POSITION OF HEART AND DIAPHRAGM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXI.\r\n\r\nHeart.\r\n\r\nRight half, red.\r\nLeft half, blue.\r\nAuricles, at upper end.\r\nVentricles, at lower end.\r\nArteries, red.\r\nVeins, blue.\r\n\r\n1.

Artery of left kidney.\r\n\r\nCIRCULATORY APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nThe action of the heart is governed and maintained by the pneumogastric\r\nnerve (tenth pair of cranial nerves); it is the inhibitory nerve of the\r\nheart, and regulates, slows, and governs its action. When the nerve is\r\ncut, the heartbeats increase rapidly, and, in fact, the organ works\r\nwithout control. When the nerve is unduly irritated the holdback, or\r\ninhibitory force, is increased, and the heart slows up in the same\r\nmeasure. The left cavities of the heart, the pulmonary veins, and the\r\naorta, or systemic artery, contain red or florid blood, fit to circulate\r\nthrough the body. The right cavities of the heart, with the venae cavae,\r\nor systemic veins, the pulmonary artery, contain dark blood, which must\r\nbe transmitted through the lungs for renovation.\r\n\r\nThe arteries, commencing in two great trunks, the aorta and the\r\npulmonary artery, undergo division, as in the branching of a tree. Their\r\nbranches mostly come off at acute angles, and are commonly of uniform\r\ndiameter in each case, but successively diminish after and in\r\nconsequence of division, and in this manner gradually merge into the\r\ncapillary system of blood vessels. As a general rule, the combined area\r\nof the branches is greater than that of the vessels from which they\r\nemanate, and hence the collective capacity of the arterial system is\r\ngreatest at the capillary vessels. The same rule applies to the veins.\r\nThe effect of the division of the arteries is to make the blood move\r\nmore slowly along their branches to the capillary vessels, and the\r\neffect of the union of the branches of the veins is to accelerate the\r\nspeed of the blood as it returns from the capillary vessels to the\r\nvenous trunks.\r\n\r\nIn the smaller vessels a frequent running together, or anastomosis,\r\noccurs. This admits of a free communication between the currents of\r\nblood, and must tend to promote equability of distribution and of\r\npressure, and to obviate the effects of local interruption. The arteries\r\nare highly elastic, being extensile and retractile both in length and\r\nbreadth. During life they are also contractile, being provided with\r\nmuscular tissue. When cut across they present, although empty, an open\r\norifice; the veins, on the other hand, collapse.\r\n\r\nIn most parts of the body the arteries are inclosed in a sheath formed\r\nof connective tissue, but are connected so loosely that, when the vessel\r\nis cut across, its ends readily retract some distance within the sheath.\r\nIndependently of this sheath, arteries are usually described as being\r\nformed of three coats, named, from the relative positions, external,\r\nmiddle, and internal. This applies to their structure so far as it is\r\ndiscernible by the naked eye. The internal, serous, or tunica intima, is\r\nthe thinnest, and is continuous with the lining membrane of the heart.\r\nIt is made up of two layers--an inner, consisting of a layer of\r\nepithelial scales, and an outer, transparent, whitish, highly elastic,\r\nand perforated. The middle coat, tunica media, is elastic, dense, and\r\nof a yellow color, consisting of nonstriated muscular and elastic\r\nfibers, thickest in the largest arteries and becoming thinner in the\r\nsmaller. In the smallest vessels it is almost entirely muscular. The\r\nexternal coat, tunica adventitia, is composed mainly of fine and closely\r\nwoven bundles of white connective tissue, which chiefly run diagonally\r\nor obliquely around the vessel. In this coat the nutrient vessels, the\r\nvasa vasorum, form a capillary network, from which a few penetrate as\r\nfar as the muscular coat.\r\n\r\nThe veins differ from arteries in possessing thinner walls, less elastic\r\nand muscular tissue, and for the most part a stronger tunica adventitia.\r\nThey collapse when cut across or when they are empty. The majority of\r\nveins are provided with valves; these are folds of the lining membrane,\r\nstrengthened by fibrous tissue. They favor the course of the blood and\r\nprevent its reflux. The nerves which supply both the arteries and the\r\nveins come from the sympathetic system. The smaller arteries terminate\r\nin the system of minute vessels known as the capillaries, which are\r\ninterposed between the termination of the arteries and the commencement\r\nof the veins. Their average diameter is about one three-thousandth of an\r\ninch.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE HEART AND BLOOD VESSELS.\r\n\r\nIn considering diseases of the heart we meet with many difficulties,\r\ndepending much upon the position which this organ occupies in the\r\nanimal. The shoulders cover so much of the anterior portion of the\r\nchest, and often in very heavy-muscled horses the chest walls are so\r\nthick that a satisfactory examination of the heart is attended with\r\ndifficulty. Diseases of the heart are not uncommon among horses; the\r\nheart and its membranes are frequently involved in diseases of the\r\nrespiratory organs, diseases of the kidneys, rheumatism, influenza, etc.\r\nSome of the diseases of this organ are never suspected by the ordinary\r\nobserver during life, and are so difficult to diagnose with any degree\r\nof certainty that we will have to confine ourselves to a general\r\noutline, giving attention to such symptoms as may serve to lead to a\r\nknowledge of their existence, with directions for treatment, care, etc.\r\n\r\nNervous affections often produce prominent heart symptoms by causing\r\nfunctional disturbance of that organ, which, if removed, will leave the\r\nheart restored to perfect vigor and normal action. Organic changes\r\ninvolving the heart or valves, however, usually grow worse and\r\neventually prove fatal. Therefore it is necessary that we arrive at an\r\nappreciation of the true nature and causes so that we may be able to\r\nform a true estimate of the possibilities for recovery or encouragement\r\nfor medical treatment.\r\n\r\nDisease of the heart may occur at any age, but it is witnessed most\r\nfrequently in young horses, which, when being trained for fast work, are\r\noften subjected to excessive hardship and fatigue. Nervous or timid\r\nanimals also suffer from such diseases more frequently than those of a\r\nsluggish disposition. Any cause which induces a violent or sudden change\r\nin the circulation may result in injury to the heart. Symptoms which may\r\nfrequently denote disease of the heart are difficult breathing or\r\nshort-windedness, dropsies of the limbs, habitual coldness of the\r\nextremities, giddiness or fainting attacks, inability to stand work,\r\nalthough the general appearance would indicate strength and ability,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\nMYOCARDITIS, OR INFLAMMATION OF THE MUSCULAR STRUCTURE OF THE HEART.\r\n\r\nThe heart muscle sometimes becomes inflamed as a complication or result\r\nof the existence of general or febrile and of infectious diseases.\r\nSevere influenza or infectious pneumonia is not infrequently followed by\r\nmyocarditis. By extension of inflammation of the endocardium or\r\npericardium the muscle of the heart may become involved. Overexertion or\r\nespecially hard work continued for a long time may cause this muscle to\r\nbecome inflamed.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Inflammation of the heart muscle is shown by inability to\r\ncontract forcibly. This results in a rapid but weak, soft pulse and\r\nirregular heart sounds. The pulse may be quite irregular as a result of\r\nthe irregular, tumultuous action of the heart. There is great general\r\nweakness, shortness of breath, and rapid respiratory movements. In some\r\ncases, where the muscle is very much softened and weakened, or, perhaps\r\nwhen an abscess forms in the wall of the heart, the course of the\r\ndisease is very rapid and terminates suddenly from paralysis or rupture\r\nof the heart.\r\n\r\n_Alterations._--The heart muscle has a brownish or yellowish, boiled\r\nappearance, and is so brittle that it tears easily. There may be a\r\nspotted appearance of the muscle from the intense changes in structure\r\nin small areas. These small areas may be due to suppuration, in which\r\ncase they have the characteristics of small abscesses. This last\r\ncondition is seen in pyemia (blood poisoning). If the disease is of long\r\nduration, the fibrous tissue in the wall of the heart may increase to\r\nsuch an extent as to produce an unnatural hardness of the wall.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In this disease the nutrition and strength of the heart\r\nshould be kept up as much as possible with good food, good care, and\r\nheart tonics and stimulants. The horse should be tempted to eat such\r\nfoods as he will take; he should be kept in an airy box stall; his legs\r\nshould be well rubbed as often as necessary to keep them warm and\r\nbandaged loosely with flannel bandages. Internally the horse may have\r\nstrychnia, in 2-grain doses twice daily, whisky in 4-ounce doses every\r\ntwo to four hours, digitalis in the form of the tincture in doses of 1\r\ndram every three to six hours. Artificial Carlsbad salts in heaping\r\ntablespoonful doses in the feed may be given three times daily for a\r\ncouple of weeks. Rest is of the greatest importance and should be\r\nallowed for a few weeks after recovery seems to be complete.\r\n\r\n\r\nENDOCARDITIS, OR INFLAMMATION OF THE LINING MEMBRANE OF THE HEART.\r\n\r\nEndocarditis frequently occurs as a complication of rheumatism, some of\r\nthe specific or zymotic fevers, specific poisoning, etc. This is a more\r\nfrequent disease among horses than is generally known, and often gives\r\nrise to symptoms which at first are obscure and unnoticed.\r\n\r\nIn influenza we may find the heart becoming involved in the disease, in\r\nconsequence of the morbid material conveyed through the heart in the\r\nblood stream. In view of the fact that many affections in even remote\r\nportions of the body may be traced directly to a primary endocardial\r\ndisease, we shall feel justified in inviting special attention to this\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nEndocarditis may be acute, subacute, or chronic. In acute inflammation\r\nwe find a thickening and a roughened appearance of the endocardium\r\nthroughout the cavities of the heart. This condition may be followed by\r\na coagulation of fibrin upon the inflamed surface, which adheres to it,\r\nand by attrition soon becomes worked up into shreddy-like granular\r\nelevations. This may lead to a formation of fibrinous clots in the heart\r\nand sudden death early in the disease the second or third day.\r\n\r\nSubacute endocarditis, which is the most common form, may not become\r\nappreciable for several days after its commencement. It is characterized\r\nby being confined to one or more anatomical divisions of the heart, and\r\nall the successive morbid changes follow each other in a comparatively\r\nslow process. Often we would not be led to suspect heart affection were\r\nit not for the distress in breathing, which it generally occasions when\r\nthe animal is exercised, especially if the valves are much involved.\r\nWhen coagula or vegetations form upon the inflamed membrane, either in\r\nminute shreds or patches, or when formation of fibrinous clots occurs in\r\nthe cavity affected, some of these materials may be carried from the\r\ncavity of the heart by the blood current into remote organs,\r\nconstituting emboli that are liable to suddenly plug vessels and thereby\r\ninterrupt important functions. In the great majority of either acute or\r\nsubacute grades of endocarditis, whatever the exciting cause, the most\r\nalarming symptoms disappear in a week or 10 days, often leaving,\r\nhowever, such changes in the interior lining or valvular structures as\r\nto cause impairment in the circulation for a much longer period of time.\r\nThese changes usually consist of thickening or induration of the\r\ninflamed structures. But while the effects of the inflammation in the\r\nmembrane lining the walls of the ventricles may subside to such a degree\r\nas to cause little or no inconvenience, or even wholly disappear, yet\r\nafter the valvular structures have been involved, causing them to be\r\nthicker, less flexible than normal, they usually remain, obstructing the\r\nfree passage of the blood through the openings of the heart, thereby\r\ninducing secondary changes, which take place slowly at first, but\r\nultimately seriously impair the animal's usefulness. What was but a\r\nslight obstruction to the circulation during the first few weeks after\r\nthe subsidence of the cardiac inflammatory attack becomes in process of\r\ntime so much increased as to induce increased growth in the muscular\r\nstructure of the heart, constituting hypertrophy of the walls of the\r\nventricles, more particularly of the left, with corresponding fullness\r\nof the left auricle and pulmonary veins, thereby producing fullness of\r\nthe capillaries in the lungs, pressure upon the air cells, difficult or\r\nasthmatic breathing--greatly increased in attempts to work--until in a\r\nfew months many of these cases become entirely disabled for work.\r\nSometimes, too, dropsical effusions in the limbs or into the cavities of\r\nthe body result from the irregular and deficient circulation.\r\nDerangement of the urinary secretion, with passive congestion of the\r\nkidneys, may also appear.\r\n\r\nEndocardial inflammation is seldom fatal in its early stages, but in\r\nmany cases the recovery is incomplete, for a large proportion is left\r\nwith some permanent thickening of the valves, which constitutes the\r\nbeginning of valvular disease.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Endocarditis may be ushered in by a chill, with sudden and\r\nmarked rise in temperature. The pulse rapidly decreases in strength or\r\nmay become irregular, while the heart beats more or less tumultuously.\r\nIn the early stages soft-blowing sounds may be heard by placing the ear\r\nover the heart on the left side, which correspond in number and rhythm\r\nto the heart's action. Excessive pain, though not so great as in acute\r\npleuritis, is manifested when the animal is compelled to trot; very\r\noften difficulty in breathing, or shortness of breath, on the slightest\r\nexertion develops early in the attack. When the valves are involved in\r\nthe inflammatory process the visible mucous membranes become either very\r\npale or very dark colored, and fainting may occur when the head is\r\nsuddenly elevated. When the valves of the right side are affected we may\r\nfind a regurgitant pulsation in the jugular vein. Occasionally it\r\nhappens that the heart contracts more frequently than the pulse\r\nbeats--that is, there may be twice as many contractions of the heart in\r\na minute as there are pulse waves in the arteries. The pulse is always\r\nvery fast. In some cases we find marked lameness of the left shoulder,\r\nand when the animal is turned short to the left side he may groan with\r\npain, and the heart's action become violently excited, although\r\npressure against the chest wall will not produce pain unless roughly\r\napplied. The animal is not disposed to eat or drink much; the surface of\r\nthe body and legs are cold--rarely excessively hot--and frequently the\r\nbody of the animal is in a subdued tremor. In nearly all cases there is\r\npartial suppression of the urinary secretion. The symptoms may continue\r\nwith very little modification for three or four days, sometimes seven\r\ndays, without any marked changes. If large fibrinous clots form in the\r\nheart the change will be sudden and quickly prove fatal unless they\r\nbecome loosened and are carried away in the circulation; then apoplexy\r\nmay result from the plugging of arteries too small to give further\r\ntransmission. If the animal manifests symptoms of improvement, the\r\nchanges usually are slow and steady until he feels apparently as well as\r\never, eats well, and moves freely in his stall or yard. When he is taken\r\nout, however, the seeming strength often proves deceptive, as he may\r\nquickly weaken if urged into a fast gait, the breathing becomes\r\nquickened with a double flank movement as in heaves, and all the former\r\nsymptoms reappear in a modified degree. An examination at this stage may\r\nreveal valvular insufficiency, cardiac hypertrophy, or pulmonary\r\nengorgement.\r\n\r\nIn fatal cases of endocarditis death often occurs about the fourth day,\r\nfrom the formation of heart clot or too great embarrassment of the\r\ncirculation. Endocarditis may be suspected in all cases where plain\r\nsymptoms of cardiac affection are manifested in animals affected with\r\ninfluenza, rheumatism, or any disease in which the blood may convey\r\nseptic matter.\r\n\r\nAcute endocardial inflammation may be distinguished from pleuritis by\r\nthe absence of any friction murmur, absence of pain when the chest wall\r\nis percussed, and the absence of effusion in the cavity of the chest. It\r\nmay be distinguished from pericarditis by the absence of the friction\r\nsounds and want of an enlarged area of dullness on percussion.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The objects to be attained by treatment will be to remove\r\nor mitigate as much as possible the cause inducing the disease; to find\r\na medicine which will lessen the irritability of the heart without\r\nweakening it; and, last, to maintain a free urinary secretion and\r\nprevent exudation and hypertrophy. So long as there is an increase of\r\ntemperature, with some degree of scantiness of the urine, it may be safe\r\nto believe that there is some degree of inflammatory action existing in\r\nthe cardiac structures, and as long as any evidence of inflammatory\r\naction remains, however moderate in degree, there is a tendency to\r\nincrease or hypertrophy of the connective tissue of the heart or valves,\r\nthereby rendering it almost certain that the structural changes will\r\nbecome permanent unless counteracted by persistent treatment and\r\ncomplete rest.\r\n\r\nThe tincture of digitalis, in 20-drop doses, repeated every hour, is\r\nperhaps the most reliable agent we know to control the irritability of\r\nthe heart, and this also has a decided influence upon the urinary\r\nsecretion. After the desired impression upon the heart is obtained the\r\ndose may be repeated every two or three hours, or as the case may\r\ndemand. Tincture of strophanthus, in 2-dram doses, will quiet the\r\ntumultuous action of the heart in some cases where the digitalis fails.\r\nBleeding, blistering, and stimulating applications to the chest should\r\nbe avoided. They serve to irritate the animal and can do no possible\r\ngood. Chlorate of potassium in 2-dram doses may be given in the drinking\r\nwater every four hours for the first five or six days, and then be\r\nsuperseded by the nitrate of potassium in half-ounce doses for the\r\nfollowing week or until the urinary secretion becomes abnormally\r\nprofuse. Where the disease is associated with rheumatism, 2-dram doses\r\nof salicylate of soda may be substituted for the chlorate of potassium.\r\nTo guard against chronic induration of the valves, the iodid of\r\npotassium, in 1 to 2 dram doses, should be given early in the disease\r\nand may be repeated two or three times a day for several weeks. When\r\nchronic effects remain after the acute stage has passed this drug\r\nbecomes indispensable.\r\n\r\nWhen dropsy of the limbs develops, it is due to weakened circulation or\r\nfunctional impairment of the kidneys. When there is much weakness in the\r\naction of the heart, or general debility is marked, the iodid of iron,\r\nin 1-dram doses, combined with hydrastis, 3 drams, may be given three\r\ntimes a day. Arsenic, in 5-grain doses twice a day, will give excellent\r\nresults in some cases of weak heart associated with difficult breathing.\r\nIn all cases absolute rest and warm stabling, with comfortable clothing,\r\nbecome necessary, and freedom from work should be allowed for a long\r\ntime after all symptoms have disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERICARDITIS, OR INFLAMMATION OF THE SAC INCLOSING THE HEART.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Pericarditis may be induced by cold and damp stabling,\r\nexposure and fatigue, from wounds caused by broken ribs, etc. Generally,\r\nhowever, it is associated with an attack of influenza, rheumatism,\r\npleuritis, etc.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Usually the disease manifests itself abruptly by a brief\r\nstage of chills coincident with pain in moving, a short painful cough,\r\nrapid and short breathing, and high temperature, with a rapid and hard\r\npulse. In the early stages of the disease the pulse is regular in beat;\r\nlater, when there is much exudation present in the pericardial sac, the\r\nheartbeat becomes muffled, and may be of a double or rebounding\r\ncharacter. By placing the ear against the left side of the chest behind\r\nthe elbow a rasping sound may be heard, corresponding to the frequency\r\nof the heartbeat. This is known as a friction sound. Between the second\r\nand fourth days this sound may disappear, due to a distension of the\r\npericardium by an exudate or serous effusion. As soon as this effusion\r\npartly fills the pericardium, percussion will reveal an abnormally\r\nincreased area of dullness over the region of the heart, the heartbeats\r\nbecome less perceptible than in health, and in some cases a splashing or\r\nflapping sound may become audible.\r\n\r\nIf the effusion becomes absorbed, the friction sound usually recurs for\r\na short time; this friction may often be felt by applying the hand to\r\nthe side of the chest. In a few cases clonic spasms of the muscles of\r\nthe neck may be present. In acute pericarditis, when the effusion is\r\nrapid and excessive, the animal may die in a few days or recovery may\r\nbegin equally as early. In subacute or in chronic cases the effusion may\r\nslowly become augmented until the pressure upon the lungs and\r\ninterference with the circulation become so great that death will\r\nresult. Whether the attack is acute, subacute, or chronic, the\r\ncharacteristic symptoms which will guide us to a correct diagnosis are\r\nthe friction sound, which is always synchronous with the heart's action,\r\nthe high temperature with hard, irritable pulse, and, in cases of\r\npericardial effusion, the increased area of dullness over the cardiac\r\nregion. When the disease is associated with influenza or rheumatism,\r\nsome of the symptoms may be obscure, but a careful examination will\r\nreveal sufficient evidence upon which to base a diagnosis. When\r\npericarditis develops as a result of or in connection with pleuritis,\r\nthe distinction may not be very clearly definable, neither will many\r\nrecover. When it results from a wound or broken rib, it almost\r\ninvariably proves fatal.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._--Pericarditis may at all times be regarded as a very\r\nserious affection. At first we will find an intense injection or\r\naccumulation of blood in the vessels of the pericardium, giving it a red\r\nand swollen appearance, during which we have the friction sound. In 24\r\nto 48 hours this engorgement is followed by an exudation of\r\nsero-fibrinous fluid, the fibrinous portion of which may soon form a\r\ncoating over the internal surface of the pericardial sac, and may\r\nultimately form a union of the opposing surfaces. Generally this\r\nadhesion will only be found to occupy a portion of the surfaces. As the\r\nserous or watery portion of this effusion is absorbed, the distinctness\r\nof the friction sound recurs, and may remain perceptible in a varied\r\ndegree for a long time. When the serous effusion is very great, the\r\npressure exerted upon the heart weakens its action, and may produce\r\ndeath soon; when it is not so great, it may cause dropsies of other\r\nportions of the body. When the adhesions of the pericardial sac to the\r\nbody of the heart are extensive, they generally lead to increased\r\ngrowth, or hypertrophy, of the heart, with or without dilatation of its\r\ncavities; when they are but slight, they may not cause any\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In acute or subacute pericarditis the tincture of\r\ndigitalis may be given in 20 to 30 drop doses every hour until the pulse\r\nand temperature become reduced. Whisky or carbonate of ammonia may be\r\ngiven regularly as stimulants. Bandages should be applied to the legs;\r\nif the legs are very cold, tincture of capsicum should be first applied;\r\nthe body should be warmly clothed in blankets, to promote perspiration.\r\nWhen the suffering from pain is very severe, 10 grains of morphin may be\r\ngiven by the mouth once or twice a day; nitrate of potassium, half an\r\nounce, in drinking water, every six hours; after the third day, iodid of\r\npotassium, in 2-dram doses, may be substituted. Cold packs to the chest\r\nin the early stages of the disease may give marked relief, or, late in\r\nthe disease, smart blisters may be applied to the sides of the chest\r\nwith benefit. If the disease becomes chronic, iodid of iron and gentian\r\nto support the strength will be indicated, but the iodid of potassium,\r\nin 1 or 2 dram doses, two or three times a day, must not be abandoned so\r\nlong as there is an evidence of effusion or plastic exudate accumulating\r\nin the pericardial sac. Where the effusion is great and threatens the\r\nlife of the patient, tapping by an expert veterinarian may save the\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALVULAR DISEASE OF THE HEART.\r\n\r\nAcute valvular disease can not be distinguished from endocarditis, and\r\nchronic valvular affections are generally the result of endocardial\r\ninflammation. The valves of the left side are the most subject--the\r\nbicuspid or mitral and the aortic or semilunar. The derangement may\r\nconsist of mere inflammation and swelling, or the edges of the valves\r\nmay become covered by the organization of the exudation, thus narrowing\r\nthe passage. Valvular obstruction and adhesions may occur or the\r\ntendinous cords may be lengthened or shortened, thus obstructing the\r\norifices and permitting the regurgitation of blood. In protected cases\r\nthe fibrous tissue of the valves may be transformed into fibro-cartilage\r\nor bone, or there may be deposits of salts of lime beneath the serous\r\nmembrance, which may terminate in ulceration, rupture, or fissures.\r\nSometimes the valves become covered by fibrinous, fleshy, or hard\r\nvegetations, or excrescences. In cases of considerable dilatation of the\r\nheart there may be atrophy and shrinking of the valves.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Valvular disease may be indicated by a venous pulse,\r\njerking pulse, intermittent pulse, irregular pulse; palpitation;\r\nconstant abnormal fullness of the jugular veins; difficulty of breathing\r\nwhen the animal becomes excited or is urged out of a walk or into a\r\nfast trot; attacks of vertigo; congestion of the brain; dropsical\r\nswelling of the limbs. A blowing, cooing, or bubbling murmur may\r\nsometimes be heard by placing the ear over the heart on the left side of\r\nthe chest.\r\n\r\nHypertrophy, or dilatation, or both, usually follow valvular disease.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--When the pulse is irregular or irritable, tonics, such as\r\npreparations of iron, gentian, and ginger, may be given. When the action\r\nof the heart is jerking or violent, 20 to 30 drop doses of tincture of\r\ndigitalis or of veratrum viride may be given until these symptoms abate.\r\nAs the disease nearly always is the result of endocarditis, the iodid of\r\npotassium and general tonics, sometimes stimulants, when general\r\ndebility supervenes, may be of temporary benefit. Very few animals\r\nrecover or remain useful for any length of time after once marked\r\norganic changes have taken place in the valvular structure of the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVENTITIOUS GROWTHS IN THE HEART.\r\n\r\nFibrous, cartilaginous, and bony formations have been observed in some\r\nrare instances in the muscular tissue. Isolated calcareous masses have\r\nsometimes been embedded in the cardiac walls. Fibrinous coagula and\r\npolypous concretions may be found in the cavities of the heart. The\r\nformer consist of coagulated fibrin, separated from the mass of blood,\r\nof a whitish or yellowish white color, translucent, of a jellylike\r\nconsistence, and having a nucleus in the center. They may slightly\r\nadhere to the surface of the cavity, from which they can easily be\r\nseparated without altering the structure of the endocardium. They\r\nprobably result from an excess of coagulability of fibrin, which is\r\nproduced by an organization of the lymph during exudation. They are\r\nusually found in the right auricle and ventricle.\r\n\r\nPolypous concretions are firmer than in the preceding, more opaque, of a\r\nfibrous texture, and may be composed of successive layers. In some\r\ninstances they are exceedingly minute, while in others they almost fill\r\none or more of the cavities. Their color is usually white, but\r\noccasionally red from the presence of blood. They firmly adhere to the\r\nendocardium, and when detached from it give it a torn appearance.\r\nOccasionally, a vascular communication seems to exist between them and\r\nthe substance of the heart. They may be the result of fibrinous\r\nexudation from inflammation of the inner surface of the heart or the\r\ncoagulation of a portion of the blood which afterwards contracts\r\nadhesion with the heart. These concretions prove a source of great\r\ninconvenience and often danger, no matter how formed. They cause a\r\ndiminution in the cavity in which they are found, thus narrowing the\r\norifice through which the blood passes, or preventing a proper\r\ncoaptation of the valves, which may produce most serious valvular\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--These are frequently uncertain; they may, however, be\r\nsuspected when the action of the heart suddenly becomes embarrassed with\r\nirregular and confused pulsations, great difficulty of breathing, and\r\nthe usual signs dependent upon the imperfect arterialization of the\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Stimulants, whisky, or carbonate of ammonia may be of\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\nPALPITATION OF THE HEART.\r\n\r\nThis is a tumultuous and usually irregular beating of the heart. It may\r\nbe due to a variety of causes, both functional and organic. It may occur\r\nas a result of indigestion, fright, increased nervousness, sudden\r\nexcitement, excessive speeding, etc. (See \"Thumps,\" p. 225.)\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The heart may act with such violence that each beat may jar\r\nthe whole body of the animal; very commonly it may be heard at a short\r\ndistance away from the animal. It can usually be traced very readily to\r\nthe exciting cause, which we may be able to avoid or overcome in the\r\nfuture and thereby obviate subsequent attacks. Rest, a mild stimulant,\r\nor a dose or two of tincture of digitalis or opium will generally give\r\nprompt relief. When it is due to organic impairment of the heart it must\r\nbe regarded as a symptom, not as a matter of primary specific treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNCOPE, OR FAINTING.\r\n\r\nActual fainting rarely occurs among horses. It may, however, be induced\r\nby a rapid and great loss of blood, pain of great intensity, a\r\nmechanical interference with the circulation of the brain, etc.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Syncope is characterized by a decrease or temporary\r\nsuspension of the action of the heart and respiration, with partial or\r\ntotal loss of consciousness. It generally occurs suddenly, though there\r\nmay be premonitory symptoms, as giddiness, or vertigo, dilated pupil,\r\nstaggering, blanching of the visible mucous membranes, a rapidly sinking\r\npulse, and dropping to the ground. The pulse is feeble or ceases to\r\nbeat; the surface of the body turns cold; breathing is scarcely to be\r\nperceived, and the animal may be entirely unconscious. This state is\r\nuncertain in duration--generally it lasts only a few minutes; the\r\ncirculation becomes restored, breathing becomes more distinct, and\r\nconsciousness and muscular strength return. In cases attended with much\r\nhemorrhage or organic disease of the heart, the fainting fit may be\r\nfatal; otherwise it will prove but a transient occurrence. In paralysis\r\nof the heart the symptoms may be exactly similar to syncope. Syncope may\r\nbe distinguished from apoplexy by the absence of stertorous breathing\r\nand lividity of the visible mucous membranes.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Dash cold water on the head; administer a stimulant--4\r\nounces of whisky or half an ounce of carbonate of ammonia. Prevent the\r\nanimal from getting up too soon, or the attack may immediately recur.\r\nAfterwards, if the attack was due to weakness from loss of blood,\r\nimpoverished blood, or associated with debility, general tonics, rest,\r\nand nourishing food are indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPERTROPHY OF THE HEART, OR CARDIAC ENLARGEMENT.\r\n\r\nHypertrophy of the heart implies augmentation of bulk in its muscular\r\nsubstance, with or without dilatation or contraction of its cavities. It\r\nmay exist with or without other cardiac affections. In valvular disease\r\nor valvular insufficiency hypertrophy frequently results as a\r\nconsequence of increased demand for propelling power. The difficulties\r\nwith which it is most frequently connected are dilatation and\r\nossification of the valves. It may also occur in connection with\r\natrophied kidneys, weak heart, etc. It may be caused by an increased\r\ndetermination of blood to the organ or from a latent form of\r\nmyocarditis, and it may arise from a long-continued increase of action\r\ndependent upon nervous disease. All the cavities of the heart may have\r\ntheir walls hypertrophied or the thickening may involve one or more.\r\nWhile the wall of a ventricle is thickened, its cavity may retain its\r\nnormal size (simple hypertrophy) or be dilated (eccentric hypertrophy),\r\nor it may be contracted (concentric hypertrophy). Hypertrophy of both\r\nventricles increases the length and breadth of the heart. Hypertrophy of\r\nthe left ventricle alone increases its length; of the right ventricle\r\nalone increases its breadth toward the right side. Hypertrophy with\r\ndilatation may affect the chambers of the heart conjointly or\r\nseparately. This form is by far the most frequent variety of cardiac\r\nenlargement. When the entire heart is affected, it assumes a globular\r\nappearance, the apex being almost obliterated and situated transversely\r\nin the chest. The bulk may become three or four times greater than the\r\naverage heart.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--In hypertrophy of the heart, in addition to the usual\r\nsymptoms manifested in organic diseases of the heart, there is a\r\npowerful and heaving impulse at each beat, which may be felt on the left\r\nside, often also on the right. These pulsations are regular, and when\r\nfull and strong at the jaw there is a tendency to active congestion of\r\nthe capillary vessels, which frequently give rise to local inflammation,\r\nactive hemorrhage, etc. If the pulse is small and feeble at the jaw, we\r\nmay conclude that there is some obstacle to the escape of the blood from\r\nthe left ventricle into the aorta, which has given rise to the\r\nhypertrophy. In case of hypertrophy with dilatation, the impulse is not\r\nonly powerful and heaving, but it is diffused over the whole region of\r\nthe heart, and the normal sounds of the heart are greatly increased in\r\nintensity. Percussion reveals an enlarged area of dullness, while the\r\nimpulse is usually much stronger than normal.\r\n\r\nDropsy of the pericardium will give the same wide space of dullness, but\r\nthe impulse and sound are lessened. An animal with a moderate degree of\r\nenlargement may possibly live a number of years and be capable of\r\nordinary work; it depends largely upon concomitant disease. As a rule,\r\nan animal affected with hypertrophy of the heart will soon be\r\nincapacitated for work, and becomes useless and incurable.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--If the cause can be discovered and is removable, it should\r\nbe done. The iodid of potassium, in cases of valvular thickening, may be\r\nof some benefit if continued for a sufficient length of time; it may be\r\ngiven in 2-dram doses, twice a day, for a month or more. The tincture of\r\ndigitalis may be given, in cases where the pulse is weak, in doses of 2\r\nteaspoonfuls three times daily. This remedy should not be continued if\r\nthe pulse becomes irregular. General tonics, freedom from excitement or\r\nfatigue, avoidance of bulky food, good ventilation, etc., are indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nDILATATION OF THE HEART.\r\n\r\nThis is an enlargement, or stretching, of the cavities of the heart, and\r\nmay be confined to one or extend to all. Two forms of dilatation may be\r\nmentioned--simple dilatation, where there is normal thickness of the\r\nwalls, and passive, or attenuated, dilatation, where the walls are\r\nsimply distended or stretched out without any addition of substance.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Any cause producing constant and excessive exertion of the\r\nheart may lead to dilatation. Valvular disease is the most frequent\r\ncause. General anemia predisposes to it by producing relaxation of\r\nmuscular fiber. Changes in the muscular tissue of the heart walls,\r\nserous infiltration from pericarditis, myocarditis, fatty degeneration\r\nand infiltration, and atrophy of the muscular fibers may all lead to\r\ndilatation.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The movements of the heart are feeble and prolonged, a\r\ndisposition to staggering or vertigo, dropsy of the limbs, very pale or\r\nvery dark-colored membranes, and difficult breathing on the slightest\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--General tonics, rich feed, and rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nFATTY DEGENERATION OF THE HEART.\r\n\r\nFatty degeneration may involve the whole organ, or may be limited to its\r\nwalls, or even to circumscribed patches. The latter is situated at the\r\nexterior, and gives it a mottled appearance. When generally involved it\r\nis flabby or flaccid, and in extreme cases collapses when emptied or\r\ncut. Upon dissection the interior of the ventricles is observed to be\r\ncovered with buff-colored spots of a singular zigzag form. This\r\nappearance may be noticed beneath the pericardium, and pervading the\r\nwhole thickness of the ventricular walls, and in extreme cases those of\r\nthe fleshy columns in the interior of the heart. These spots are found\r\nto be degenerated muscular fibers and colonies of oil globules. Fatty\r\ndegeneration is often associated with other morbid conditions of the\r\nheart, such as obesity, dilatation, rupture, aneurism, etc. It may be\r\nconnected with fatty diseases of other organs, such as the liver,\r\nkidneys, etc. When it exists alone its presence is seldom suspected\r\nprevious to death. It may be secondary to hypertrophy of the heart, to\r\nmyocarditis, or to pericarditis. It may be due to deteriorated\r\nconditions of the blood in wasting diseases, excessive hemorrhages,\r\netc., or to poisoning with arsenic and phosphorus.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The most prominent symptoms of fatty degeneration are a\r\nfeeble action of the heart, a remarkably slow pulse, general debility,\r\nand attacks of vertigo. It may exist for a long time, but is apt to\r\nterminate suddenly in death upon the occurrence of other diseases,\r\nsurgical operations, etc. It may involve a liability to sudden death\r\nfrom rupture of the ventricular walls.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Confinement in feed to oats, wheat or rye bran, and\r\ntimothy hay. Twenty drops of sulphuric acid may be given in drinking\r\nwater three times a day, and hypophosphite of iron in 2-dram doses,\r\nmixed with the feed, twice a day. Other tonics and stimulants as they\r\nmay be indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUPTURE OF THE HEART.\r\n\r\nThis may occur as the result of some previous disease, such as fatty\r\ndegeneration, dilatation with weakness of the muscular walls, etc. It\r\nmay be caused by external violence, a crushing fall, pressure of some\r\ngreat weight, etc. Usually death follows a rupture very quickly, though\r\nan animal may live for some time when the rent is not very large.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEAKNESS OF THE HEART.\r\n\r\nThis may arise from general debility, the result of exhausting disease,\r\noverwork, or heart strain, or loss of blood. It is indicated by a small,\r\nfeeble, but generally regular pulse, coldness of the body, etc.\r\n\r\nTreatment should be directed to support and increase the strength of the\r\nanimal by tonics, rest, and nutritious feed. Carbonate of ammonia may be\r\ngiven to stimulate the heart's action and to prevent the formation of\r\nheart clot.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGESTION OF THE HEART\r\n\r\nCongestion, or an accumulation of the blood in the cavities of the\r\nheart, may occur in consequence of fibrinous deposits interfering with\r\nthe free movements of the valves, usually the product of endocarditis or\r\nas a result of excessive muscular exertion.\r\n\r\nSymptoms are great difficulty of breathing, paleness of the visible\r\nmucous membranes, great anxiety, frequently accompanied by a general\r\ntremor and cold perspiration, followed by death. It usually results in\r\ndeath very quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\nCYANOSIS OF NEWBORN FOALS.\r\n\r\nThis is a condition sometimes found in foals immediately after birth,\r\nand is due to nonclosure of the foramen ovale, which allows a mixture of\r\nthe venous with the arterial blood in the left cavities of the heart. It\r\nis characterized by a dark purple or bluish color of the visible mucous\r\nmembranes, shortness of breath, and a general feebleness. Foals thus\r\naffected generally live only a few hours after birth.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF ARTERIES, OR ARTERITIS AND ENDARTERITIS.\r\n\r\nInflammation of arteries is rarely observed in the horse as a primary\r\naffection. Direct injuries, such as blows, may produce a contusion and\r\nsubsequent inflammation of the wall of an artery; severe muscular strain\r\nmay involve an arterial trunk; hypertrophy of the heart, by increasing\r\narterial tension, may result in the production of a general\r\nendarteritis. Septic infection may affect the inner coat and ultimately\r\ninvolve all three, or it may be the result of an inflammation in the\r\nvicinity of the vessels, etc. Inflammation of arteries, whatever the\r\ncause may be, often leads to very serious results in the development of\r\nsecondary changes in their walls. Arteritis may be acute, subacute, or\r\nchronic; when the inner coat alone is affected it is known as\r\nendarteritis.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Arteritis is characterized by a painful swelling along the\r\ninflamed vessel, throbbing pulse, coldness of the parts supplied by the\r\ninflamed vessel, sometimes the formation of gangrenous sloughs,\r\nsuppuration, abscess, etc. In an inflammation of the iliac arteries we\r\nfind coldness and excessive lameness or paralysis of one or both hind\r\nlimbs.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._--In acute arteritis we find swelling along the vessel, loss\r\nof elasticity, friability, and thickening of the walls; a roughness and\r\nloss of gloss of the inner coat, with the formation of coagula or pus in\r\nthe vessel. Subacute or chronic arteritis may affect only the outer coat\r\n(periarteritis), both the outer and middle coat, or the inner coat alone\r\n(endarteritis); and by weakening the respective coats leads to rupture,\r\naneurism, or to degenerations, such as bony, calcareous, fatty,\r\natheromatous, etc. It may also lead to sclerosis or increase of fibrous\r\ntissue, especially in the kidneys, when it may result in the condition\r\nknown as arterio-capillary fibrosis. Chronic endarteritis is fruitful in\r\nthe production of thrombus and atheroma. Arteritis may be limited to\r\nsingle trunks or it may affect, more or less, all the arteries of the\r\nbody. Arteries which are at the seat of chronic endarteritis are liable\r\nto suffer degenerative changes, consisting chiefly of fatty\r\ndegeneration, calcification, or the breaking down of the degenerated\r\ntissue, and the formation of erosions or ulcerlike openings in the inner\r\ncoat. These erosions are frequently called atheromatous ulcers, and\r\nfragments of tissue from these ulcers may be carried into the\r\ncirculation, forming emboli. Fibrinous thrombi are apt to form upon the\r\nroughened surface of the inner coat or upon the surface of the erosions.\r\n\r\nFatty degeneration and calcification of the middle and outer coats may\r\noccur, and large, hard, calcareous plates project inward, upon which\r\nthrombi may form or may exist in connection with atheroma of the inner\r\ncoat. When there is much thickening and increase of new tissue in the\r\nwall of the affected artery it may encroach upon the capacity of the\r\nvessel, and even lead to obliteration. This is often associated with\r\ninterstitial inflammation of glandular organs.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Carbonate of potassium in 1-dram doses, to be given in 4\r\nounces liquor acetate of ammonia every six hours; scalded bran\r\nsufficient to produce loosening of the bowels, and complete rest;\r\nexternally, applications of hot water or hot hop infusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nATHEROMA.\r\n\r\nAtheroma is a direct result of an existing chronic endarteritis, the\r\nlining membrane of the vessels being invariably involved to a greater or\r\nless degree. It is most frequently found in the arteries, although the\r\nveins may develop an atheromatous condition when exposed to any source\r\nof prolonged irritation. Atheroma may affect arteries in any part of the\r\nbody; in some instances almost every vessel is diseased, in others only\r\na few, or even parts of one vessel. It is a very common result of\r\nendocarditis extending into the aorta, which we find perhaps the most\r\nfrequent seat of atheroma. As a result of this condition the affected\r\nvessel becomes impaired in its contractile power, loses its natural\r\nstrength, and, in consequence of its inability to sustain its accustomed\r\ninternal pressure, undergoes in many cases dilatation at the seat of\r\ndisease, constituting aneurism. In an atheromatous vessel, calcareous\r\ndeposits soon occur, which render it rigid, brittle, and subject to\r\nulceration or rupture. In such vessels the contractility is destroyed,\r\nthe middle coat atrophied and beyond repair. Atheroma in the vessels of\r\nthe brain is a frequent cause of cerebral apoplexy. No symptoms are\r\nmanifested by which we can recognize this condition during life.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTRICTION OF AN ARTERY.\r\n\r\nThis is usually the result of arteritis, and may partly or wholly be\r\nimpervious to the flow of blood. When this occurs in a large vessel it\r\nmay be followed by gangrene of the parts; usually, however, collateral\r\ncirculation will be established to nourish the parts previously supplied\r\nby the obliterated vessel. In a few instances constriction of the aorta\r\nhas produced death.\r\n\r\n\r\nANEURISM.\r\n\r\nAneurism is usually described as true or false. True aneurism is a\r\ndilatation of the coats of an artery over a larger or smaller part of\r\nits course. Such dilatations are usually due to chronic endarteritis and\r\natheroma. False aneurism is formed after a puncture of an artery by a\r\ndilatation of the adhesive lymph by which the puncture was united.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--If the aneurism is seated along the neck or a limb it\r\nappears as a tumor in the course of an artery and pulsating with it. The\r\ntumor is round, soft, and compressible, and yields a peculiar\r\nfluctuation upon pressure. By applying the ear over it a peculiar\r\npurring or hissing sound may sometimes be heard. Pulsation, synchronous\r\nwith the action of the heart, is the diagnostic symptom. It is of a\r\nslow, expansive, and heavy character, as if the whole tumor were\r\nenlarging under the hand. Aneurisms seated internally may occupy the\r\ncavity of the cranium, chest, or abdomen. As regards the first, little\r\nis known during life, for all the symptoms which they produce may arise\r\nfrom other causes. Aneurism of the anterior aorta may be situated very\r\nclosely to the heart or in the arch, and it is very seldom that we can\r\ndistinguish it from disease of the heart. The tumor may encroach upon\r\nthe windpipe and produce difficulty in breathing, or it may produce\r\npressure upon the vena cava or the thoracic duct, obstructing the flow\r\nof blood and lymph. In fact, whatever parts the aneurism may reach or\r\nsubject to its pressure, may have their functions suspended or\r\ndisturbed. When the tumor in the chest is large, we generally find much\r\nirregularity in the action of the heart; the superficial veins of the\r\nneck are distended, and there is usually dropsical swelling under the\r\nbreast and of the limbs. There may be a very troublesome cough without\r\nany evidence of lung affection. Sometimes pulsation of the tumor may be\r\nfelt at the lower part of the neck where it joins the chest. When the\r\naneurism occurs in the posterior aorta no diagnostic symptoms are\r\nappreciable; when it occurs in the internal iliac arteries an\r\nexamination per rectum will reveal it.\r\n\r\nThere is one form of aneurism which is not infrequently overlooked,\r\naffecting the anterior mesenteric artery, primarily induced by a\r\nworm--_Strongylus vulgaris_. This worm produces an arteritis, with\r\natheroma, degeneration, and dilatation of the mesenteric arteries,\r\nassociated with thrombus and aneurism. The aneurism gives rise to colic,\r\nwhich appears periodically in a very violent and often persistent type.\r\nOrdinary colic remedies have no effect, and after a time the animal\r\nsuccumbs to the disease. In all cases of animals which are habitually\r\nsubject to colicky attacks, parasitic aneurism of the anterior\r\nmesenteric artery may be suspected. (See p. 92.)\r\n\r\n_Pathology._--Aneurisms may be diffuse or sacculated. The diffuse\r\nconsists in a uniform dilatation of all the coats of an artery, so that\r\nit assumes the shape of a cylindrical swelling. The wall of the aneurism\r\nis atheromatous, or calcified; the middle coat may be atrophied. The\r\nsacculated, or circumscribed, aneurism consists either in a dilatation\r\nof the entire circumference of an artery over a short portion of its\r\nlength, or in a dilatation of only a small portion of one side of the\r\nwall. Aneurism may become very large; as it increases in size it presses\r\nupon and causes the destruction of neighboring tissues. The cavity of\r\nthe aneurismal sac is filled with fluid or clotted blood or with layers\r\nof fibrin which adhere closely to its wall. Death is produced usually by\r\nthe pressure and interference of the aneurism with adjoining organs or\r\nby rupture. In worm aneurism we usually find large thrombi within the\r\naneurismal dilatation of the artery, which sometimes plug the whole\r\nvessel or extend into the aorta. Portions of this thrombus, or clot, may\r\nbe washed away and produce embolism of a smaller artery. The effect in\r\neither case is to produce anemia of the intestinal canal, serous or\r\nbloody exudation in its walls, which leads to paralysis of the intestine\r\nand resultant colicky symptoms.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The only treatment advisable is to extirpate or ligate the\r\ntumor above and below.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUPTURE OF AN ARTERY.\r\n\r\nEndarteritis, with its subsequent changes in the walls of arteries, is\r\nthe primary cause of rupture in the majority of instances. The rupture\r\nmay be partial, involving only one or two coats, and will then form an\r\naneurism. If complete, it may produce death when it involves a large\r\nvessel, especially if it is situated in one of the large cavities\r\npermitting an excessive escape of blood. Rupture may be produced by\r\nmechanical violence or accident.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--In fatal rupture, associated with profuse bleeding, the\r\nanimal becomes weak, the visible mucous membranes become blanched, the\r\nbreathing hurried or gasping, pupils dilated, staggering in gait,\r\nsyncope, death. When the hemorrhage is limited the symptoms may not\r\nbecome noticeable; if it is near the surface of the body a round or\r\ndiffuse swelling or tumor may form, constituting a hygroma. If the\r\nrupture is associated with an external wound, the bleeding artery should\r\nbe ligated, or where a bandage is applicable, pressure may be applied\r\nby tight bandaging. As a secondary result of rupture of an artery we may\r\nhave formation of abscess, gangrene of a part, etc.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--When rupture of a deep-seated artery is suspected, large\r\ndoses of fluid extract of ergot may be given to produce contraction of\r\nthe blood vessels. Tannin and iron are also useful. The animal should be\r\nallowed to have as much water as he desires. Afterwards stimulants and\r\nnourishing feed are indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHROMBUS AND EMBOLISM.\r\n\r\nBy thrombosis is generally understood the partial or complete closure of\r\na vessel by a morbid product developed at the site of the obstruction.\r\nThe coagulum, which is usually fibrinous, is known as a thrombus. The\r\nterm \"embolism\" designates an obstruction caused by any body detached\r\nand transported from the interior of the heart or of some vessel.\r\nThrombi occur as the result of an injury to the wall of the vessel or\r\nmay follow its compression or dilatation; they may result from some\r\nalteration of the wall of the vessel by disease or by the retardation of\r\nthe circulation. These formations may occur during life, in the heart,\r\narteries, veins, or in the portal system. When a portion of fibrin\r\ncoagulates in one of the arteries and is carried along by the\r\ncirculation, it will be arrested, of course, in the capillaries, if not\r\nbefore; when in the veins, it may not be stopped until it reaches the\r\nlungs; and when in the portal system the capillaries of the liver will\r\nprevent its further progress. The formation of thrombi may act primarily\r\nby causing partial or complete obstruction, and, secondarily, either by\r\nlarger or smaller fragments becoming detached from their end and by\r\nbeing carried along by the circulation of the blood to remote vessels,\r\nembolism; or by the coagulum becoming softened and converted into pus,\r\nconstituting suppurative phlebitis. These substances occur most\r\nfrequently in those affections characterized by great exhaustion or\r\ndebility, such as pneumonia, purpura hemorrhagica, endocarditis,\r\nphlebitis, puerperal fever, hemorrhages, etc. These concretions may form\r\nsuddenly and produce instantaneous death by retarding the blood current,\r\nor they may arise gradually, in which case the thrombi may be organized\r\nand attached to the walls of the heart, or they may soften, and\r\nfragments of them (emboli) may be carried away. The small, wartlike\r\nexcrescences occurring sometimes in endocarditis may occasionally form a\r\nfoundation on which a thrombi may develop.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--When heart clot, or thrombus, exists in the right side, the\r\nreturn of blood from the body and the aeration in the lungs is impeded,\r\nand if death occurs, it is owing to syncope rather than to strangulation\r\nin pulmonary respiration. There will be hurried and gasping breathing,\r\npaleness and coldness of the surface of the body, a feeble and\r\nintermittent or fluttering pulse, and fainting. When a fibrinous\r\ncoagulum is carried into the pulmonary artery from the right side of the\r\nheart, the indications are a swelling and infiltration of the lungs and\r\npulmonary apoplexy. When the clot is situated in the left cavities of\r\nthe heart or in the aorta, death, if it occurs, takes place either\r\nsuddenly or at the end of a few hours from coma.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._--When a coagulum is observed in the heart it may become a\r\nquestion whether it was formed during life or after death. The loose,\r\ndark coagula so often found after death are polypi. If the deposition\r\nhas taken place during the last moments of life, the fibrin will be\r\nisolated and soft, but not adherent to the walls; if it be isolated,\r\ndense, and adherent or closely intertwined with the muscles of the\r\npapillae and tendinous cords, the deposition has occurred more or less\r\nremote from the act of dying. Occasionally the fibrin may be seen lining\r\none of the cavities of the heart, like a false endocardium, or else\r\nforming an additional coat to the aorta or other large vessels without\r\nproducing much obstruction. Thrombi, in some instances, soften in their\r\ncenters, and are then observed to contain a puslike substance. If this\r\nsoftening has extended considerably, an outer shell, or cyst, only may\r\nremain. The sources of danger exist not only in the interruption of the\r\ncirculation of the blood, but also in a morbid state of the system,\r\nproduced by the disturbed nutrition of a limb or organ, as well as the\r\nmingling of purulent and gangrenous elements with the blood.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The urgent symptoms should be relieved by rest,\r\nstimulants, and the use of agents which will act as solvents to the\r\nfibrinous clots. Alkalis are specially useful for this purpose.\r\nCarbonate of ammonia may be administered in all cases of thrombus, and\r\nshould be continued for a long time in small doses several times a day.\r\nIn cases of great debility associated with a low grade of fever,\r\nstimulants and tonics, and nitro-muriatic acid as an antiseptic, may be\r\nbeneficial.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF VEINS, OR PHLEBITIS.\r\n\r\nInflammation of veins may be simple or diffuse. In simple phlebitis the\r\ndisease of the vein is confined to a circumscribed or limited portion of\r\na vein; in diffuse it involves the vein for a long distance; it may even\r\nextend from a limb or foot to the heart.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Phlebitis may be induced by contusions or direct injuries, an\r\nextension of inflammation from surrounding tissue, such as in abscess,\r\nformation of tumor, or malignant growth. It is often due to embolism of\r\ninfective material, gangrenous matter, etc. Blood-letting from the\r\njugular vein is occasionally followed by dangerous phlebitis.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms vary according to the extent and severity of\r\nthe inflammation. In most cases the vein is swollen, thickened, and\r\nindurated to such a degree as to resemble an artery. A diffused\r\nswelling, with great tenderness, may extend along the affected vessel\r\nand the animal manifest all the symptoms connected with acute fever and\r\ngeneral functional disturbance.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._--The disease is only serious when large veins are affected.\r\nThe coats undergo the same changes as in arteritis; clots of blood and\r\nlymph plug the inflamed vessel, and, if the inflammatory process\r\ncontinues, these are converted into pus, which ruptures the vessel and\r\nproduces a deep abscess; or it may be carried away in the circulation\r\nand produce metastatic abscess in the lungs or other remote organs. In\r\nmild cases the clots may become absorbed and the vessel restored to\r\nhealth. Phlebitis in the course of the veins of the limbs frequently\r\nleads to numerous abscesses, which may be mistaken for farcy\r\nulcerations. A very common result of phlebitis is an obliteration of the\r\naffected portion of the vein, but as collateral circulation is readily\r\nestablished this is seldom of any material inconvenience.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Phlebitis should be treated by the application of a smart\r\nblister along the course of the inflamed vessel; early opening of any\r\nabscesses which may form; the animal should have complete rest, and the\r\nbowels be kept loose with bran mashes. When the fever runs high,\r\nhalf-ounce doses of nitrate of potassium may be given in the drinking\r\nwater, which may be changed in two or three days for 1-dram doses of the\r\niodid of potassium. If the animal becomes debilitated, carbonate of\r\nammonia, 1 dram, and powdered gentian, 3 drams, may be given every six\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARICOSE VEINS, VARIX, OR DILATATION OF VEINS.\r\n\r\nThis may be a result of weakening of the coats from inflammatory disease\r\nand degeneration. It may also be due to mechanical obstruction from\r\ninternal or external sources. It is sometimes found in the vein which\r\nlies superficial over the inside of the hock joint, and may be due to\r\nthe pressure of a spavin. Occasionally it may be observed in stallions,\r\nwhich are more or less subject to varicocele, or dilatation of the veins\r\nof the testicular cord. Hemorrhoidal veins, or piles, are occasionally\r\nmet with, generally in horses which run at pasture. Varicose veins may\r\nulcerate and form an abscess in the surrounding tissues, or they may\r\nrupture from internal blood pressure and the blood form large tumors\r\nwhere the tissues are soft.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Stallions which manifest a tendency to varicocele should\r\nwear suspensory bags when they are exercised. Piles may often be reduced\r\nby astringent washes--tea made from white-oak bark or a saturated\r\nsolution of alum. The bowels should be kept loose with bran mashes and\r\nthe animal kept quiet in the stable. When varicose veins exist\r\nsuperficially and threaten to produce inconvenience, they may be ligated\r\nabove and below and thus obliterated. Sometimes absorption may be\r\ninduced by constant bandages.\r\n\r\n\r\nAIR IN VEINS, OR AIR EMBOLISM.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly supposed that the entrance of air into a vein at the\r\ntime of the infliction of a wound or in blood-letting was extremely\r\ndangerous and very often produced sudden death by interfering with the\r\ncirculation of the blood through the heart and lungs. Danger from air\r\nembolism is exceedingly doubtful, unless great quantities were forced\r\ninto a large vein by artificial means.\r\n\r\n\r\nPURPURA HEMORRHAGICA.\r\n\r\nPurpura hemorrhagica usually occurs as a sequel to debilitating\r\ndiseases, such as strangles, influenza, etc. It may, however, arise in\r\nthe absence of any previous disease in badly ventilated stables, among\r\npoorly fed horses, and in animals subject to exhausting work and extreme\r\ntemperatures. The disease is probably due to some as yet undiscovered\r\ninfectious principle. Its gravity does not depend so much upon the\r\namount of blood extravasated as it does upon the disturbance or\r\ndiminished action of the vasomotor centers.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--This disease becomes manifested by the occurrence of sudden\r\nswellings on various parts of the body, on the head or lips, limbs,\r\nabdomen, etc. These swellings may be diffused or very markedly\r\ncircumscribed, though in the advanced stages they cover large areas.\r\nThey pit on pressure and are but slightly painful to the touch. The\r\nlimbs may swell to a very large size, the nostrils may become almost\r\nclosed, and the head and throat may swell to the point of suffocation.\r\nThe swellings not infrequently disappear from one portion of the body\r\nand develop on another, or may recede from the surface and invade the\r\nintestinal mucous membrane. The mucous lining of the nostrils and mouth\r\nshow more or less dark-red or purple spots. There may be a discharge of\r\nblood-colored serum from the nostrils; the tongue may be swollen so as\r\nto prevent eating or closing of the jaws. In the most intense cases,\r\nwithin from twenty-four to forty-eight hours bloody serum may exude\r\nthrough the skin over the swollen parts, and finally large gangrenous\r\nsloughs may form. The temperature is never very high, the pulse is\r\nfrequent and compressible, and becomes feebler as the animal loses\r\nstrength. A cough is usually present. The urine is scanty and high\r\ncolored, and when the intestines are much affected a bloody diarrhea may\r\nset in, with colicky pains. Some of the internal organs become\r\nimplicated in the disease, the lungs may become edematous, extravasation\r\nmay occur in the intestinal canal, or effusion of serum into the cavity\r\nof the chest or abdomen; occasionally the brain becomes affected. A few\r\ncases run a mild course and recovery may commence in three or four days;\r\ngenerally, however, the outlook is unfavorable. In severe cases septic\r\npoisoning is liable to occur, which soon brings the case to a fatal\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._--On section we find the capillaries dilated, the connective\r\ntissue filled with a coagulable or coagulated lymph, and frequently we\r\nmay discover gangrenous spots beneath the skin or involving the skin.\r\nThe lymphatic glands are swollen and inflamed. Extensive extravasations\r\nof blood may be found embedded between the coats of the intestines, or\r\nexcessive effusion into the substance of the lungs.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Diffusible stimulants and tonics should be given from the\r\nstart. Carbonate of ammonia, 1 dram, fluid extract of red cinchona bark,\r\n2 drams, and tincture of ginger half an ounce, with half a pint of\r\nwater; thin gruel or milk should be given every four or six hours. But\r\nespecial care should be exercised to avoid injury by drenching. If the\r\nhorse has difficulty in getting the head up and swallowing, smaller\r\ndoses must be given with a small hard-rubber syringe. Sulphate of iron\r\nin 1-dram doses may be dissolved in water and given every six hours.\r\nChlorate of potassium, in 2-ounce doses, may be given every eight or\r\ntwelve hours. Colloidal silver may be administered intravenously in\r\ndoses of from 5 to 12 grains. Washings with lead and alum water are\r\nuseful and may be repeated several times each day. If the swellings are\r\nvery great, they may be incised freely and the resulting wounds should\r\nbe washed at least twice daily with a warm 3 per cent solution of\r\ncarbolic acid or other good antiseptic. Tracheotomy may be necessary.\r\nComplications, when they arise, must be treated with proper\r\ncircumspection.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nThe lymphatic, or absorbent, system is connected with the blood-vascular\r\nsystem, and consists of a series of tubes which absorb and convey to the\r\nblood certain fluids. These tubes lead to lymphatic glands, through\r\nwhich the fluids pass to reach the right lymphatic vein and thoracic\r\nduct, both of which enter the venous system near the heart. Through the\r\nexcessively thin walls of the capillaries the fluid part of the blood\r\ntransudes to nourish the tissues outside the capillaries; at the same\r\ntime fluid passes from the tissues into the blood. The fluid, after it\r\npasses into the tissues, constitutes the lymph, and acts like a stream\r\nirrigating the tissue elements. Much of the surplus of this lymph passes\r\ninto the lymph vessels, which in their commencement can hardly be\r\ntreated as independent structures, since their walls are so closely\r\njoined with the tissues through which they pass, being nothing more\r\nthan spaces in the connective tissue until they reach the larger lymph\r\nvessels, which finally empty into lymph glands. These lymph glands are\r\nstructures so placed that the lymph flowing toward the larger trunks\r\npasses through them, undergoing a sort of filtration. From the fact of\r\nthis arrangement lymph glands are subject to inflammatory diseases in\r\nthe vicinity of diseased structures, because infective material being\r\nconveyed in the lymph stream lodges in the glands and produces\r\nirritation.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCAL INFLAMMATION AND ABSCESS OF LYMPHATIC GLANDS.\r\n\r\nAcute inflammation of the lymph glands usually occurs in connection with\r\nsome inflammatory process in the region from which its lymph is\r\ngathered. Several or all of the glands in a cluster may become affected,\r\nas in strangles, nasal catarrh, or nasal gleet, diseased or ulcerated\r\nteeth, the lymph glands between the branches of the lower jaw almost\r\ninvariably become affected, which may lead to suppuration or induration.\r\nSimilar results obtain in other portions of the body; in pneumonia the\r\nbronchial glands become affected; in pharyngitis the postpharyngeal\r\nglands lying above the trachea become affected, etc.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The glands swell and become painful to the touch, the\r\nconnective tissue surrounding them becomes involved, suppuration usually\r\ntakes place, and one or more abscesses form. If the inflammation is of a\r\nmilder type, resolution may take place and the swelling recede, the\r\nexudative material being absorbed, and the gland restored without the\r\noccurrence of suppuration. In the limbs a whole chain of the glands\r\nalong the lymphatic vessels may become affected, as in farcy, phlebitis,\r\nor septic poisoning.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Fomentation with hot water and the application of\r\ncamphorated soap liniment or camphorated oil may produce a revulsive\r\naction and prevent suppuration. If there is any indication of abscess\r\nforming, poultices of linseed meal and bran made into a paste with hot\r\nwater should be applied, or a mild blistering ointment rubbed in over\r\nthe swollen gland. As soon as fluctuation can be felt a free opening\r\nmust be made for the escape of the contained pus. The wound may\r\nsubsequently be washed out with a solution of chlorid of zinc, 5 grains\r\nto the ounce of water, three times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYMPHANGITIS.\r\n\r\nSpecific inflammation of the lymphatic structures usually affects the\r\nhind legs; very seldom a fore leg. This disease is very sudden in its\r\nattack, exceedingly painful, accompanied by a high temperature and great\r\ngeneral disturbance.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Horses of lymphatic or sluggish temperament are predisposed\r\nto this affection. It usually attacks well-fed animals, and in such\r\ncases may be due to an excess of nutritive elements in the blood. Sudden\r\nchanges in work or in the habits of the animal may induce an attack.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--It is usually ushered in by a chill, rise in temperature,\r\nand some uneasiness; in a very short time this is followed by lameness\r\nin one leg and swelling on the inside of the thigh. The swelling\r\ngradually surrounds the whole limb and continues on downward until it\r\nreaches the foot. The limb is excessively tender to the touch, the\r\nanimal perspires, the breathing is accelerated, pulse hard and quick,\r\nand the temperature may reach 106 deg. F. The bowels early become very\r\nconstipated and urine scanty. The symptoms usually are on the increase\r\nfor about two days, then they remain stationary for the same length of\r\ntime; the fever then abates; the swelling recedes and becomes less\r\npainful. It is very seldom, though, that all the swelling leaves the\r\nleg; generally it leaves some permanent enlargement, and the animal\r\nbecomes subject to recurrent attacks. Occasionally the inguinal\r\nlymphatic glands (in the groin) undergo suppuration, and pyemia may\r\nsupervene and prove fatal. In severe cases the limb becomes denuded of\r\nhair in patches, and the skin remains indurated with a fibrous growth,\r\nwhich is known by the name of elephantiasis.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The parts should be bathed freely and frequently with\r\nwater as hot as the hand can bear and then fomented with vinegar and\r\nwater, equal parts, to which add 2 ounces of nitrate of potassium for\r\neach gallon. This should be applied frequently, after the hot water, for\r\nthe first day. Afterwards the leg may be dried with a woolen cloth and\r\nbathed with camphorated soap liniment. Internally administer artificial\r\nCarlsbad salts in 2 to 4 ounce doses three times daily. Feed lightly and\r\ngive complete rest. This treatment, if instituted early in the attack,\r\nvery frequently brings about a remarkable change within 24 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE EYE.\r\n\r\nBY JAMES LAW, F. R. C. V. S.,\r\n\r\n_Formerly Professor of Veterinary Science, etc., Cornell University_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can scarcely overestimate the value of sound eyes in the horse, and\r\nhence all diseases and injuries which seriously interfere with vision\r\nare matters of extreme gravity and apprehension, for should they prove\r\npermanent they invariably depreciate the selling price to a considerable\r\nextent. A blind horse is always dangerous in the saddle or in single\r\nharness, and he is scarcely less so when, with partially impaired\r\nvision, he sees things imperfectly, in a distorted form or in a wrong\r\nplace, and when he shies or avoids objects which are commonplace or\r\nfamiliar. When we add to this that certain diseases of the eyes, like\r\nrecurring inflammation (moon blindness), are habitually transmitted from\r\nparent to offspring, we can realize still more fully the importance of\r\nthese maladies. Again, as a mere matter of beauty, a sound, full, clear,\r\nintelligent eye is something which must always add a high value to our\r\nequine friends and servants.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE OF THE EYE.\r\n\r\n(Pl. XXII.)\r\n\r\nTHE EYEBALL.\r\n\r\nA full description of the structure of the eye is incompatible with our\r\nprescribed limits, and yet a short description is absolutely essential\r\nto the clear understanding of what is to follow.\r\n\r\nThe horse's eye is a spheroidal body, flattened behind, and with its\r\nposterior four-fifths inclosed by an opaque, white, strong fibrous\r\nmembrane (the sclerotic), on the inner side of which is laid a more\r\ndelicate, friable membrane, consisting mainly of blood vessels and\r\npigment cells (the choroid), which in its turn is lined by the extremely\r\ndelicate and sensitive expansion of the nerve of sight (the retina). The\r\nanterior fifth of the globe of the eye bulges forward from what would\r\nhave been the direct line of the sclerotic, and thus forms a segment of\r\na much smaller sphere than is inclosed by the sclerotic. Its walls, too,\r\nhave in health a perfect translucency, from which it has derived the\r\nname of transparent cornea. This transparent coat is composed, in the\r\nmain, of fibers with lymph interspaces, and it is to the condition of\r\nthese and their condensation and compression that the translucency is\r\nlargely due. This may be shown by compressing with the fingers the eye\r\nof an ox which has just been killed, when the clear transparent cornea\r\nwill suddenly become clouded over with a whitish-blue opacity, and this\r\nwill remain until the compression is interrupted. The interior of the\r\neye contains three transparent media for the refraction of the rays of\r\nlight on their way from the cornea to the visual nerve. Of these media\r\nthe anterior one (aqueous humor) is liquid, the posterior (vitreous\r\nhumor) is semisolid, and the intermediate one (crystalline lens) is\r\nsolid. The space occupied by the aqueous humor corresponds nearly to the\r\nportion of the eye covered by the transparent cornea. It is, however,\r\ndivided into two chambers, anterior and posterior, by the iris, a\r\ncontractile curtain with a hole in the center (the pupil), and which may\r\nbe looked on as in some sense a projection inward of the vascular and\r\npigmentary coat from its anterior margin at the point where the\r\nsclerotic or opaque outer coat becomes continuous with the cornea or\r\ntransparent one. This iris, or curtain, besides its abundance of blood\r\nvessels and pigment, possesses two sets of muscular fibers, one set\r\nradiating from the margin of the pupil to the outer border of the\r\ncurtain at its attachment to the sclerotic and choroid, and the other\r\nencircling the pupil in the manner of a ring. The action of the two sets\r\nis necessarily antagonistic, the radiating fibers dilating the pupil and\r\nexposing the interior of the eye to view, while the circular fibers\r\ncontract this opening and shut out the rays of light. The form of the\r\npupil in the horse is ovoid, with its longest diameter from side to\r\nside, and its upper border is fringed by several minute, black bodies\r\n(corpora nigra) projecting forward and serving to some extent the\r\npurpose of eyebrows in arresting and absorbing the excess of rays of\r\nlight which fall upon the eye from above. These pigmentary projections\r\nin front of the upper border of the pupil are often mistaken for the\r\nproducts of disease or injury in place of the normal and beneficent\r\nprotectors of the nerve of sight which they are. Like all other parts,\r\nthey may become the seat of disease, but so long as they and the iris\r\nretain their clear, dark, aspect, without any tints of brown or yellow,\r\nthey may be held to be healthy.\r\n\r\nThe vitreous or semisolid refracting medium occupies the posterior part\r\nof the eye--the part corresponding to the sclerotic, choroid, and\r\nretina--and has a consistency corresponding to that of the white of an\r\negg, and a power of refraction of the light rays correspondingly greater\r\nthan the aqueous humor.\r\n\r\nThe third or solid refracting medium is a biconvex lens, with its\r\nconvexity greatest on its posterior surface, which is lodged in a\r\ndepression in the vitreous humor, while its anterior surface corresponds\r\nto the opening of the pupil. It is inclosed in a membranous covering\r\n(capsule) and is maintained in position by a membrane (suspensory\r\nligament) which extends from the margin of the lens outward to the\r\nsclerotic at the point of junction of the choroid and iris. This\r\nligament is, in its turn, furnished with radiating, muscular fibers,\r\nwhich change the form or position of the lens so as to adapt it to see\r\nwith equal clearness objects at a distance or close by.\r\n\r\nAnother point which strikes the observer of the horse's eye is that in\r\nthe darkness a bright, bluish tinge is reflected from the widely dilated\r\npupil. This is owing to a comparative absence of pigment in the choroid\r\ncoat inside the upper part of the eyeball, and enables the animal to see\r\nand advance with security in darkness where the human eye would be of\r\nlittle use. The lower part of the cavity of the horse's eye, into which\r\nthe dazzling rays fall from the sky, is furnished with an intensely\r\nblack lining, by which the rays penetrating the inner nervous layer are\r\ninstantly absorbed.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSCLES OF THE EYE.\r\n\r\nThese consist of four straight muscles, two oblique, and one retractor.\r\nThe straight muscles pass from the depth of the orbit forward on the\r\ninner, outer, upper, and lower sides of the eyeball, and are fixed to\r\nthe anterior portion of the fibrous (sclerotic) coat, so that in\r\ncontracting singly they respectively turn the eye inward, outward,\r\nupward, and downward. When all act together they draw the eyeball deeply\r\ninto its socket. The retractor muscle also consists of four muscular\r\nslips, repeating the straight muscles on a smaller scale, but as they\r\nare only attached on the back part of the eyeball they are less adapted\r\nto roll the eye than to draw it down into its socket. The two oblique\r\nmuscles rotate the eye on its own axis, the upper one turning its outer\r\nsurface upward and inward, and the lower one turning it downward and\r\ninward.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HAW (THE WINKING CARTILAGE, OR CARTILAGO NICTITANS).\r\n\r\nThis is a structure which, like the retractor muscle, is not found in\r\nthe eye of man, but it serves in the lower animals to assist in removing\r\nforeign bodies from the front of the eyeball. It consists, in the horse,\r\nof a cartilage of irregular form, thickened inferiorly and posteriorly\r\nwhere it is intimately connected with the muscles of the eyeball and the\r\nfatty material around them, and expanded and flattened anteriorly where\r\nits upper surface is concave, and, as it were, molded on the lower and\r\ninner surface of the eyeball. Externally it is covered by the mucous\r\nmembrane which lines the eyelids and extends over the front of the eye.\r\nIn the ordinary restful state of the eye the edge of this cartilage\r\nshould just appear as a thin fold of membrane at the inner angle of the\r\neye, but when the eyeball is drawn deeply into the orbit the cartilage\r\nis pushed forward, outward, and upward over it until the entire globe\r\nmay be hidden from sight. This protrusion of the cartilage so as to\r\ncover the eye may be induced in the healthy eye by pressing the finger\r\nand thumb on the upper and lower lids, so as to cause retraction of the\r\neyeball into the socket. When foreign bodies, such as sand, dust, and\r\nchaff, or other irritants, have fallen on the eyeball or eyelids it is\r\nsimilarly projected to push them off, their expulsion being further\r\nfavored by a profuse flow of tears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXII.\r\n\r\nDIAGRAMMATIC VERTICAL SECTION THROUGH HORSE'S EYE.]\r\n\r\nThis is seen, to a lesser extent, in all painful inflammations of the\r\neye, and to a very marked degree in lockjaw, when the spasm of the\r\nmuscles of the eyeball draws the latter deeply into the orbit and\r\nprojects forward the masses of fat and the cartilage. The brutal\r\npractice of cutting off this apparatus whenever it is projected\r\nnecessitates this explanation, which it is hoped may save to many a\r\nfaithful servant a most valuable appendage. That the cartilage and\r\nmembrane may become the seat of disease is undeniable, but so long as\r\nits edge is thin and even and its surface smooth and regular the mere\r\nfact of its projection over a portion or the whole of the eyeball is no\r\nevidence of disease in its substance, nor any warrant for its removal.\r\nIt is usually but the evidence of the presence of some pain in another\r\npart of the eye, which the suffering animal endeavors to assuage by the\r\nuse of this beneficent provision. For the diseases of the cartilage\r\nitself, see \"Encephaloid cancer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLACRIMAL APPARATUS.\r\n\r\nThis consists, first, of a gland for the secretion of the tears, and,\r\nsecond, of a series of canals for the conveyance of the superfluous\r\ntears into the cavity of the nose.\r\n\r\nThe gland is situated above the outer part of the eyeball, and the tears\r\nwhich have flowed over the eye and reached the inner angle are there\r\ndirected by a small, conical papilla (lacrimal caruncle) into two minute\r\norifices, and thence by two ducts (lacrimal) to a small pouch (lacrimal\r\nsac) from which a canal leads through the bones of the face into the\r\nnose. This opens in the lower part of the nose on the floor of the\r\npassage and a little outside the line of union of the skin which lines\r\nthe false nostril with the mucous membrane of the nose. In the ass and\r\nmule this opening is situated on the roof instead of the floor of the\r\nnose, but still close to the external opening.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION OF THE EYE.\r\n\r\nTo avoid unnecessary repetition the following general directions are\r\ngiven for the examination of the eye: The eye, and to a certain extent\r\nthe mucous membrane lining the eyelids, may be exposed to view by gently\r\nparting the eyelids with the thumb and forefinger pressed on the middle\r\nof the respective lids. The pressure, it is true, causes the protrusion\r\nof the haw over a portion of the lower and inner part of the eye, but by\r\ngentleness and careful graduation of the pressure this may be kept\r\nwithin bounds, and oftentimes even the interior of the eye can be seen.\r\nAs a rule it is best to use the right hand for the left eye, and the\r\nleft hand for the right, the finger in each case being pressed on the\r\nupper lid while the thumb depresses the lower one. In cases in which it\r\nis desirable to examine the inner side of the eyelid further than is\r\npossible by the above means, the upper lid may be drawn down by the\r\neyelashes with the one hand and then everted over the tip of the\r\nforefinger of the other hand, or over a probe laid flat against the\r\nmiddle of the lid. When the interior of the eye must be examined it is\r\nuseless to make the attempt in the open sunshine or under a clear sky.\r\nThe worst cases, it is true, can be seen under such circumstances, but\r\nfor the slighter forms the horse should be taken indoors, where all\r\nlight from above will be shut off, and should be placed so that the\r\nlight may fall on the eye from the front and side. Then the observer,\r\nplacing himself in front of the animal, will receive the reflected rays\r\nfrom the cornea, the front of the lens and the back, and can much more\r\neasily detect any cloudiness, opacity, or lack of transparency. The\r\nexamination can be made much more satisfactory by placing the horse in a\r\ndark chamber and illuminating the eye by a lamp placed forward and\r\noutward from the eye which is to be examined. Any cloudiness is thus\r\neasily detected, and any doubt may be resolved by moving the lamp so\r\nthat the image of the flame may be passed in succession over the whole\r\nsurface of the transparent cornea and of the crystalline lens. Three\r\nimages of the flame will be seen, the larger one upright, reflected from\r\nthe anterior surface of the eye; a smaller one upright, reflected from\r\nthe anterior surface of the lens; and a second small one inverted from\r\nthe back surface of the lens.\r\n\r\nSo long as these images are reflected from healthy surfaces they will be\r\nclear and perfect in outline, but as soon as one strikes on an area of\r\nopacity it will become diffused, cloudy, and indefinite. Thus, if the\r\nlarge, upright image becomes hazy and imperfect over a particular spot\r\nof the cornea, that will be found to be the seat of disease and opacity.\r\nShould the large image remain clear, but the small upright one become\r\ndiffuse and indefinite over a given point, it indicates opacity on the\r\nfront of the capsule of the lens. If both upright images remain clear\r\nwhile the inverted one becomes indistinct at a given point, then the\r\nopacity is in the substance of the lens itself or in the posterior part\r\nof its capsule.\r\n\r\nIf in a given case the pupil remains so closely contracted that the\r\ndeeper parts of the eye can not be seen, the eyelids may be rubbed with\r\nextract of belladonna, and in a short time the pupil will be found\r\nwidely dilated.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE EYELIDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGENITAL DISORDERS.\r\n\r\nSome faulty conditions of the eyelids are congenital, as division of an\r\neyelid in two, after the manner of harelip, abnormally small opening\r\nbetween the lids, often connected with imperfect development of the eye,\r\nand closure of the lids by adhesion. The first is to be remedied by\r\nparing the edges of the division and then bringing them together, as in\r\ntorn lids. The last two, if remediable at all, require separation by the\r\nknife, and subsequent treatment with a cooling astringent eyewash.\r\n\r\n\r\nNERVOUS DISORDERS.\r\n\r\nSPASM OF EYELIDS may be owing to constitutional susceptibility, or to\r\nthe presence of local irritants (insects, chemical irritants, sand,\r\netc.) in the eye, to wounds or inflammation of the mucous membrane, or\r\nto disease of the brain. When due to local irritation it may be\r\ntemporarily overcome by instilling a few drops of a 4 per cent solution\r\nof cocaine into the eye, when the true cause may be ascertained and\r\nremoved. The nervous or constitutional disease must be treated according\r\nto its nature.\r\n\r\nDROOPING EYELIDS, OR PTOSIS.--This is usually present in the upper lid,\r\nor is at least little noticed in the lower. It is sometimes but a\r\nsymptom of paralysis of one-half of the face, in which case the ear,\r\nlips, and nostrils on the same side will be found soft, drooping, and\r\ninactive, and even the half of the tongue may partake of the palsy. If\r\nthe same condition exists on both sides, there is difficult, snuffling\r\nbreathing, from the air drawing in the flaps of the nostrils in\r\ninspiration, and all feed is taken in by the teeth, as the lips are\r\nuseless. In both there is a free discharge of saliva from the mouth\r\nduring mastication. This paralysis is a frequent result of injury, by a\r\npoke, to the seventh nerve, as it passes over the back of the lower jaw.\r\nIn some cases the paralysis is confined to the lid, the injury having\r\nbeen sustained by the muscles which raise it, or by the supraorbital\r\nnerve, which emerges from the bone just above the eye. Such injury to\r\nthe nerve may have resulted from fracture of the orbital process of the\r\nfrontal bone above the eyeball.\r\n\r\nThe condition may, however, be due to spasm of the sphincter muscle,\r\nwhich closes the lids, or to inflammation of the upper lid, usually a\r\nresult of blows on the orbit. In the latter case it may run a slow\r\ncourse with chronic thickening of the lid.\r\n\r\nThe paralysis due to the poke may be often remedied, first, by the\r\nremoval of any remaining inflammation by a wet sponge worn beneath the\r\near and kept in place by a bandage; secondly, when all inflammation has\r\npassed, by a blister on the same region, or by rubbing it daily with a\r\nmixture of olive oil and strong aqua ammonia in equal proportions.\r\nImprovement is usually slow, and it may be months before complete\r\nrecovery ensues.\r\n\r\nIn paralysis from blows above the eyes the same treatment may be applied\r\nto that part.\r\n\r\nThickening of the lid may be treated by painting with tincture of iodin,\r\nand that failing, by cutting out an elliptical strip of the skin from\r\nthe middle of the upper lid and stitching the edges together.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE EYELIDS.\r\n\r\nThe eyelids suffer more or less in all severe inflammations of the eye,\r\nwhether external or internal, but inasmuch as the disease sometimes\r\nstarts in the lids and at other times is exclusively confined to them,\r\nit deserves independent mention.\r\n\r\nAmong the causes may be named: Exposure to drafts of cold air, or to\r\ncold rain or snow storms; the bites or stings of mosquitoes, flies, or\r\nother insects; snake bites, pricks with thorns, blows of whip or club;\r\naccidental bruises against the stall or ground, especially during the\r\nviolent struggles of colic, enteritis, phrenitis (staggers), and when\r\nthrown for operations. It is also a result of infecting inoculations, as\r\nof erysipelas, anthrax, boil, etc., and is noted by Leblanc as\r\nespecially prevalent among horses kept on low, marshy pastures. Finally,\r\nthe introduction of sand, dust, chaff, beards of barley and seeds of the\r\nfinest grasses, and the contact with irritant, chemical powders,\r\nliquids, and gases (ammonia from manure or factory, chlorin, strong\r\nsulphur fumes, smoke, and other products of combustion, etc.) may start\r\nthe inflammation. The eyelids often undergo extreme inflammatory and\r\ndropsical swelling in urticaria (nettlerash, surfeit) and in the general\r\ninflammatory dropsy known as purpura hemorrhagica.\r\n\r\nThe affection will, therefore, readily divide itself into (1)\r\ninflammations due to constitutional causes; (2) those due to direct\r\ninjury, mechanical or chemical; and (3) such as are due to inoculation\r\nwith infecting material.\r\n\r\n(1) Inflammations due to constitutional causes are distinguished by the\r\nabsence of any local wound, and the history of a low, damp pasture,\r\nexposure, indigestion from unwholesome feed, or the presence elsewhere\r\non the limbs or body of the general, doughy swellings of purpura\r\nhemorrhagica. The lids are swollen and thickened; it may be slightly or\r\nit may be so extremely that the eyeball can not be seen. If the lid can\r\nbe everted to show its mucous membrane, that is seen to be of a deep-red\r\ncolor, especially along the branching lines of the blood vessels. The\r\npart is hot and painful, and a profuse flow of tears and mucus escapes\r\non the side of the face, causing irritation and loss of the hair. If\r\nimprovement follows, this discharge becomes more tenacious, and tends to\r\ncause adhesion to the edges of the upper and lower lids and to mat\r\ntogether the eyelashes in bundles. This gradually decreases to the\r\nnatural amount, and the redness and congested appearance of the eye\r\ndisappears, but swelling, thickening, and stiffness of the lids may\r\ncontinue for a time. There may be more or less fever according to the\r\nviolence of the inflammation, but so long as there is no serious disease\r\nof the interior of the eye or of other vital organ, it is usually\r\nmoderate.\r\n\r\nThe local treatment consists in astringent, soothing lotions (sugar of\r\nlead 30 grains, laudanum 2 teaspoonfuls, rain water--boiled and\r\ncooled--1 pint), applied with a soft cloth kept wet with the lotion, and\r\nhung over the eye by tying it to the headstall of the bridle on the two\r\nsides. If the mucous membrane lining of the lids is the seat of little\r\nred granular elevations, a drop of solution of 2 grains of nitrate of\r\nsilver in an ounce of distilled water should be applied with the soft\r\nend of a clean feather to the inside of the lid twice a day. The patient\r\nshould be removed from all such conditions (pasture, faulty feed,\r\nexposure, etc.) as may have caused or aggravated the disease, and from\r\ndust and irritant fumes and gases. He should be fed from a manger high\r\nenough to favor the return of blood from the head, and should be kept\r\nfrom work, especially in a tight collar which would prevent the descent\r\nof blood by the jugular veins. The diet should be laxative and\r\nnonstimulating (grass, bran mashes, carrots, turnips, beets, potatoes,\r\nor steamed hay), and any costiveness should be corrected by a mild dose\r\nof raw linseed oil (1 to 1-1/2 pints). In cold weather warm blanketing\r\nmay be needful, and even loose flannel bandages to the limbs, but heat\r\nshould never be sought at the expense of pure air.\r\n\r\n(2) In inflammations due to local irritants of a noninfective kind a\r\ncareful examination will usually reveal their presence, and the first\r\nstep must be their removal with a pair of blunt forceps or the point of\r\na lead pencil. Subsequent treatment will be in the main the local\r\ntreatment advised above.\r\n\r\n(3) In case of infective inflammation there will often be found a prick\r\nor tear by which the septic matter has entered, and in such case the\r\ninflammation will for a time be concentrated at that point. A round or\r\nconical swelling around an insect bite is especially characteristic. A\r\nsnake bite is marked by the double prick made by the two teeth and by\r\nthe violent and rapidly spreading inflammation. Erysipelas is attended\r\nwith much swelling, extending beyond the lids and causing the mucous\r\nmembrane to protrude beyond the edge of the eyelid (chemosis). This is\r\ncharacterized by a bright, uniform, rosy red, disappearing on pressure,\r\nor later by a dark, livid hue, but with less branching redness than in\r\nnoninfecting inflammation and less of the dark, dusky, brownish or\r\nyellowish tint of anthrax. Little vesicles may appear on the skin, and\r\npus may be found without any distinct limiting membrane, as in abscess.\r\nIt is early attended with high fever and marked general weakness and\r\ninappetence. Anthrax of the lids is marked by a firm swelling,\r\nsurmounted by a blister, with bloody serous contents, which tends to\r\nburst and dry up into a slough, while the surrounding parts become\r\ninvolved in the same way. Or it may show as a diffuse, dropsical\r\nswelling, with less of the hard, central sloughing nodule, but, like\r\nthat, tending to spread quickly. In both cases alike the mucous membrane\r\nand the skin, if white, assumes a dusky-brown or yellowish-brown hue,\r\nwhich is largely characteristic. This may pass into a black color by\r\nreason of extravasation of blood. Great constitutional disturbance\r\nappears early, with much prostration and weakness and generalized\r\nanthrax symptoms.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment will vary according to the severity. Insect\r\nbites may be touched with a solution of equal parts of glycerin and aqua\r\nammonia, or a 10 per cent solution of carbolic acid in water. Snake\r\nbites may be bathed with aqua ammonia, and the same agent given in doses\r\nof 2 teaspoonfuls in a quart of water, or alcohol may be given in pint\r\nor quart doses, according to the size of the animal. In erysipelas the\r\nskin may be painted with tincture of chlorid of iron, or with a solution\r\nof 20 grains of iodin in an ounce of carbolic acid, and one-half an\r\nounce of tincture of chlorid of iron may be given thrice daily in a\r\nbottle of water. In anthrax the swelling should be painted with tincture\r\nof iodin, or of the mixture of iodin and carbolic acid, and if very\r\nthreatening it may have the tincture of iodin injected into the swelling\r\nwith a hypodermic syringe, or the hard mass may be freely incised to its\r\ndepth with a sharp lancet and the lotion applied to the exposed tissues.\r\nInternally, iodid of potassium may be given in doses of 2 drams thrice a\r\nday, or tincture of the chlorid of iron every four hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTY, OR FURUNCLE (BOIL) OF THE EYELID.\r\n\r\nThis is an inflammation of limited extent, advancing to the formation of\r\nmatter and the sloughing out of a small mass of the natural tissue of\r\nthe eyelid. It forms a firm, rounded swelling, usually near the margin\r\nof the lid, which suppurates and bursts in four or five days. Its course\r\nmay be hastened by a poultice of camomile flowers, to which have been\r\nadded a few drops of carbolic acid, the whole applied in a very thin\r\nmuslin bag. If the swelling is slow to open after having become\r\nyellowish white, it may be opened by a lancet, the incision being made\r\nat right angles to the margin of the lid.\r\n\r\n\r\nENTROPION AND ECTROPION, OR INVERSION AND EVERSION OF THE EYELID.\r\n\r\nThese are respectively caused by wounds, sloughs, ulcers, or other\r\ncauses of loss of substance of the mucous membrane on the inside of the\r\nlid and of the skin on the outside; also of tumors, skin diseases, or\r\nparalysis which leads to displacement of the margin of the eyelid. As a\r\nrule, they require a surgical operation, with removal of an elliptical\r\nportion of the mucous membrane or skin, as the case may be, but which\r\nrequires the skilled and delicate hand of the surgeon.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRICHIASIS.\r\n\r\nThis consists in the turning in of the eyelashes so as to irritate the\r\nfront of the eye. If a single eyelash, it may be snipped off with\r\nscissors close to the margin of the eyelid or pulled out by the root\r\nwith a pair of flat-bladed forceps. If the divergent lashes are more\r\nnumerous, the treatment may be as for entropion, by excising an\r\nelliptical portion of skin opposite the offending lashes and stitching\r\nthe edges together, so as to draw outward the margin of the lid at that\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARTS AND OTHER TUMORS OF THE EYELIDS.\r\n\r\nThe eyelids form a favorite site for tumors, and above all, warts, which\r\nconsist in a simple diseased overgrowth (hypertrophy) of the surface\r\nlayers of the skin. If small, they may be snipped off with scissors or\r\ntied around the neck with a stout, waxed thread and left to drop off,\r\nthe destruction being completed, if necessary, by the daily application\r\nof a piece of sulphate of copper (blue vitriol), until any unhealthy\r\nmaterial has been removed. If more widely spread, the wart may still be\r\nclipped off with curved scissors or knife, and the caustic thoroughly\r\napplied day by day.\r\n\r\nA bleeding wart, or erectile tumor, is more liable to bleed, and is best\r\nremoved by constricting its neck with the waxed cord or rubber band, or\r\nif too broad it may be transfixed through its base by a needle armed\r\nwith a double thread, which is then to be cut in two and tied around the\r\ntwo portions of the neck of the tumor. If still broader, the armed\r\nneedle may be carried through the base of the tumor at regular\r\nintervals, so that the whole may be tied in moderately sized sections.\r\n\r\nIn gray and in white horses black, pigmentary tumors (melanotic) are\r\ncommon on the black portions of skin, such as the eyelids, and are to be\r\nremoved by scissors or knife, according to their size. In the horse they\r\ndo not usually tend to recur when thoroughly removed, but at times they\r\nprove cancerous (as is the rule in man), and then they tend to reappear\r\nin the same site or in internal organs with, it may be, fatal effect.\r\n\r\nEncysted, honeylike (melicerous), sebaceous, and fibrous tumors of the\r\nlids all require removal with the knife.\r\n\r\n\r\nTORN EYELIDS OR WOUNDS OF EYELIDS.\r\n\r\nThe eyelids are torn by attacks with horns of cattle, or with the teeth,\r\nor by getting caught on nails in stall, rack, or manger, on the point of\r\nstumps, fences, or fence rails, on the barbs of wire fences, and on\r\nother pointed bodies. The edges should be brought together as promptly\r\nas possible, so as to effect union without the formation of matter,\r\npuckering of the skin, and unsightly distortions. Great care is\r\nnecessary to bring the two edges together evenly without twisting or\r\npuckering. The simplest mode of holding them together is by a series of\r\nsharp pins passed through the lips of the wound at intervals of not more\r\nthan a third of an inch, and held together by a thread twisted around\r\neach pin in the form of the figure 8, and carried obliquely from pin to\r\npin in two directions, so as to prevent gaping of the wound in the\r\nintervals. The points of the pins may then be cut off with scissors, and\r\nthe wound may be wet twice a day with a weak solution of carbolic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUMOR OF THE HAW, OR CARIES OF THE CARTILAGE.\r\n\r\nThough cruelly excised for alleged \"hooks,\" when itself perfectly\r\nhealthy, in the various diseases which lead to retraction of the eye\r\ninto its socket, the haw may, like other bodily structures, be itself\r\nthe seat of actual disease. The pigmentary, black tumors of white horses\r\nand soft (encephaloid) cancer may attack this part primarily or extend\r\nto it from the eyeball or eyelids; hairs have been found growing from\r\nits surface, and the mucous membrane covering it becomes inflamed in\r\ncommon with that covering the front of the eye. These inflammations are\r\nbut a phase of the inflammation of the external structures of the eye,\r\nand demand no particular notice nor special treatment. The tumors lead\r\nto such irregular enlargement and distortion of the haw that the\r\ncondition is not to be confounded with the simple projection of the\r\nhealthy structure over the eye when the lids are pushed apart with the\r\nfinger and thumb, and the same remark applies to the ulceration, or\r\ncaries, of the cartilage. In the latter case, besides the swelling and\r\ndistortion of the haw, there is this peculiarity, that in the midst of\r\nthe red inflamed mass there appears a white line or mass formed by the\r\nexposed edge of the ulcerating cartilage. The animal having been thrown\r\nand properly fixed, an assistant holds the eyelids apart while the\r\noperator seizes the haw with forceps or hook and carefully dissects it\r\nout with blunt-pointed scissors. The eye is then covered with a cloth,\r\nkept wet with an eyewash, as for external ophthalmia.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSTRUCTION OF THE LACRIMAL APPARATUS, OR WATERING EYE.\r\n\r\nThe escape of tears on the side of the cheek is a symptom of external\r\ninflammation of the eye, but it may also occur from any disease of the\r\nlacrimal apparatus which interferes with the normal progress of the\r\ntears to the nose; hence, in all cases when this symptom is not attended\r\nwith special redness or swelling of the eyelids, it is well to examine\r\nthe lacrimal apparatus. In some instances the orifice of the lacrimal\r\nduct on the floor of the nasal chamber and close to its anterior outlet\r\nwill be found blocked by a portion of dry mucopurulent matter, on the\r\nremoval of which tears may begin to escape. This implies an inflammation\r\nof the canal, which may be helped by occasional sponging out of the nose\r\nwith warm water, and the application of the same on the face. Another\r\nremedy is to feed warm mashes of wheat bran from a nosebag, so that the\r\nrelaxing effects of the water vapor may be secured.\r\n\r\nThe two lacrimal openings, situated at the inner angle of the eye, may\r\nfail to admit the tears by reason of their deviation outward in\r\nconnection with the eversion of the lower lid or by reason of their\r\nconstriction in inflammation of the mucous membrane. The lacrimal sac,\r\ninto which the lacrimal ducts open, may fail to discharge its contents\r\nby reason of constriction or closure of the duct leading to the nose,\r\nand it then forms a rounded swelling beneath the inner angle of the eye.\r\nThe duct leading from the sac to the nose may be compressed or\r\nobliterated by fractures of the bones of the face, and in disease of\r\nthese bones (osteosarcoma, so-called osteoporosis, diseased teeth,\r\nglanders of the nasal sinuses, abscess of the same cavities).\r\n\r\nThe narrowed or obstructed ducts may be made pervious by a fine, silver\r\nprobe passed down to the lacrimal sac, and any existing inflammation of\r\nthe passages may be counteracted by the use of steaming mashes of wheat\r\nbran, by fomentations or wet cloths over the face, and even by the use\r\nof astringent eyewashes and the injection of similar liquids into the\r\nlacrimal canal from its nasal opening. The ordinary eyewash may be used\r\nfor this purpose, or it may be injected after dilution to half its\r\nstrength. The fractures and diseases of the bones and teeth must be\r\ntreated according to their special demands when, if the canal is still\r\nleft pervious, it may be again rendered useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTERNAL OPHTHALMIA, OR CONJUNCTIVITIS.\r\n\r\nIn inflammation of the outer parts of the eyeball the exposed vascular\r\nand sensitive mucous membrane (conjunctiva) which covers the ball, the\r\neyelids, the haw, and the lacrimal apparatus, is usually the most deeply\r\ninvolved, yet adjacent parts are more or less implicated, and when\r\ndisease is concentrated on these contiguous parts it constitutes a\r\nphase of external opththalmia which demands a special notice. These have\r\naccordingly been already treated of.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--The causes of external opththalmia are mainly those that act\r\nlocally--blows with whips, clubs, and twigs, the presence of foreign\r\nbodies, like hayseed, chaff, dust, lime, sand, snuff, pollen of plants,\r\nflies attracted by the brilliancy of the eye, wounds of the bridle, the\r\nmigration of the scabies (mange) insect into the eye, smoke, ammonia\r\narising from the excretions, irritant emanations from drying marshes,\r\netc. Road dust containing infecting microbes is a common factor. A very\r\ndry air is alleged to act injuriously by drying the eye as well as by\r\nfavoring the production of irritant dust; the undue exposure to bright\r\nsunshine through a window in front of the stall, or to the reflection\r\nfrom snow or water, also is undoubtedly injurious. The unprotected\r\nexposure of the eyes to sunshine through the use of a very short\r\noverdraw check is to be condemned, and the keeping of the horse in a\r\nvery dark stall, from which it is habitually led into the glare of full\r\nsunlight, intensified by reflection from snow or white limestone, must\r\nbe set down among the locally acting causes. Exposure to cold and wet,\r\nto wet and snow storms, to cold drafts and wet lairs must also be\r\naccepted as causes of conjunctivitis, the general disorder which they\r\nproduce affecting the eye, if that happens to be the weakest and most\r\nsusceptible organ of the body, or if it has been subjected to any\r\nspecial local injury, like dust, irritant gases, or excess of light.\r\nAgain, external opththalmia is a constant concomitant of inflammation of\r\nthe contiguous and continuous mucous membranes, as those of the nose and\r\nthroat--hence the red, watery eyes that attend on nasal catarrh, sore\r\nthroat, influenza, strangles, nasal glanders, and the like. In such\r\ncases, however, the affection of the eye is subsidiary and is manifestly\r\novershadowed by the primary and predominating disease.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are watering of the eye, swollen lids, redness\r\nof the mucous membrane exposed by the separation of the lids--it may be\r\na mere pink blush with more or less branching redness, or it may be a\r\ndeep, dark red, as from effusion of blood--and a bluish opacity of the\r\ncornea, which is normally clear and translucent. Except when resulting\r\nfrom wounds and actual extravasation of blood, however, the redness is\r\nseen to be superficial, and if the opacity is confined to the edges, and\r\ndoes not involve the entire cornea, the aqueous humor behind is seen to\r\nbe still clear and limpid. The fever is always less severe than in\r\ninternal ophthalmia, and runs high only in the worst cases. The eyelids\r\nmay be kept closed, the eyeball retracted, and the haw protruded over\r\none-third or one-half of the ball, but this is due to the pain only and\r\nnot to any excessive sensibility to light, as shown by the comparatively\r\nwidely dilated pupil. In internal ophthalmia, on the contrary, the\r\nnarrow, contracted pupil is the measure of the pain caused by the\r\nfalling of light on the inflamed and sensitive optic nerve (retina) and\r\nchoroid.\r\n\r\nIf the affection has resulted from a wound of the cornea, not only is\r\nthat the point of greatest opacity, forming a white speck or fleecy\r\ncloud, but too often blood vessels begin to extend from the adjacent\r\nvascular covering of the eye (sclerotic) to the white spot, and that\r\nportion of the cornea is rendered permanently opaque. Again, if the\r\nwound has been severe, though still short of cutting into the anterior\r\nlayers of the cornea, the injury may lead to ulceration that may\r\npenetrate more or less deeply and leave a breach in the tissue which, if\r\nfilled up at all, is repaired by opaque fibrous tissue in place of the\r\ntransparent cellular structure. Pus may form, and the cornea assumes a\r\nyellowish tinge and bursts, giving rise to a deep sore which is liable\r\nto extend as an ulcer, and may be in its turn followed by bulging of the\r\ncornea at that point (staphyloma). This inflammation of the conjunctiva\r\nmay be simply catarrhal, with profuse mucopurulent discharge; it may be\r\ngranular, the surface being covered with minute reddish elevations, or\r\nit may become the seat of a false membrane (diphtheria).\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In treating external ophthalmia the first object is the\r\nremoval of the cause. Remove any dust, chaff, thorn, or other foreign\r\nbody from the conjunctiva, purify the stable from all sources of\r\nammoniacal or other irritant gas; keep the horse from dusty roads, and,\r\nabove all, from the proximity of a leading wagon and its attendant cloud\r\nof dust; remove from pasture and feed from a rack which is neither so\r\nhigh as to drop seeds, etc., into the eyes nor so low as to favor the\r\naccumulation of blood in the head; avoid equally excess of light from a\r\nsunny window in front of the stall and excess of darkness from the\r\nabsence of windows; preserve from cold drafts and rains and wet bedding,\r\nand apply curative measures for inflammation of the adjacent mucous\r\nmembranes or skin. If the irritant has been of a caustic nature, remove\r\nany remnant of it by persistent bathing with tepid water and a soft\r\nsponge, or with water mixed with white of egg, or a glass filled with\r\nthe liquid may be inverted over the eye so that its contents may dilute\r\nand remove the irritant. If the suffering is very severe, a lotion with\r\na few grains of extract of belladonna or of morphia in an ounce of water\r\nmay be applied, or, if it is available, a few drops of 4 per cent\r\nsolution of cocaine may be instilled into the eye.\r\n\r\nIn strong, vigorous patients benefit will usually be obtained from a\r\nlaxative, such as 2 tablespoonfuls of Glauber's salt daily, and if the\r\nfever runs high from a daily dose of half an ounce of saltpeter. As\r\nlocal applications, astringent solutions are usually the best, as 30\r\ngrains of borax or of sulphate of zinc in a quart of water, to be\r\napplied constantly on a cloth, as advised under \"Inflammation of the\r\neyelids.\" In the absence of anything better, cold water may serve every\r\npurpose. Above all, adhesive and oily agents (molasses, sugar, fats) are\r\nto be avoided, as only adding to the irritation. By way of suggesting\r\nagents that may be used with good effect, salt and sulphate of soda may\r\nbe named, in solutions double the strength of sulphate of zinc, or 7\r\ngrains of nitrate of silver may be added to a quart of distilled water,\r\nand will be found especially applicable in granular conjunctivitis,\r\ndiphtheria, or commencing ulceration. A cantharides blister (1 part of\r\nSpanish fly to 4 parts lard) may be rubbed on the side of the face 3\r\ninches below the eye, and washed off next morning with soapsuds and\r\noiled daily till the scabs are dropped.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE SPECKS AND CLOUDINESS OF THE CORNEA.\r\n\r\nAs a result of external ophthalmia, opaque specks, clouds, or haziness\r\nare too often left on the cornea and require for their removal that they\r\nbe daily touched with a soft feather dipped in a solution of 3 grains\r\nnitrate of silver in 1 ounce distilled water. This should be applied\r\nuntil all inflammation has subsided, and until its contact is\r\ncomparatively painless. It is rarely successful with an old, thick scar\r\nfollowing an ulcer, nor with an opacity having red blood vessels running\r\nacross it.\r\n\r\n\r\nULCERS OF THE CORNEA.\r\n\r\nThese may be treated with nitrate of silver lotion of twice the strength\r\nused for opacities. Powdered gentian, one-half ounce, and sulphate of\r\niron, one-fourth ounce, daily, may improve the general health and\r\nincrease the reparatory power.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNAL OPHTHALMIA (IRITIS, CHOROIDITIS, AND RETINITIS).\r\n\r\nAlthough inflammations of the iris, choroid, and retina--the inner,\r\nvascular, and nervous coats of the eye--occur to a certain extent\r\nindependently of each other, yet one usually supervenes upon the other,\r\nand, as the symptoms are thus made to coincide, it will be best for our\r\npresent purposes to treat the three as one disease.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--The causes of internal ophthalmia are largely those of the\r\nexternal form only, acting with greater intensity or on a more\r\nsusceptible eye. Severe blows, bruises, punctures, etc., of the eye, the\r\npenetration of foreign bodies into the eye (thorns, splinters of iron,\r\netc.), sudden transition from a dark stall to bright sunshine, to the\r\nglare of snow or water, constant glare from a sunny window, abuse of the\r\noverdraw checkrein, vivid lightning flashes, drafts of cold, damp air;\r\nabove all, when the animal is perspiring, exposure in cold rain or\r\nsnowstorms, swimming cold rivers; also certain general diseases like\r\nrheumatism, arthritis, influenza, and disorders of the digestive\r\norgans, may become complicated by this affection. From the close\r\nrelation between the brain and eye--alike in the blood vessels and\r\nnerves--disorders of the first lead to affection of the second, and the\r\nsame remark applies to the persistent irritation to which the jaws are\r\nsubjected in the course of dentition. So potent is the last agency that\r\nwe dread a recurrence of ophthalmia so long as dentition is incomplete,\r\nand hope for immunity if the animal completes its dentition without any\r\npermanent structural change in the eye.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms will vary according to the cause. If the\r\nattack is due to direct physical injury, the inflammation of the eyelids\r\nand superficial structures may be quite as marked as that of the\r\ninterior of the eye. If, on the other hand, from general causes, or as a\r\ncomplication of some distant disease, the affection may be largely\r\nconfined to the deeper structures, and the swelling, redness, and\r\ntenderness of the superficial structures will be less marked. When the\r\nexternal coats thus comparatively escape, the extreme anterior edge of\r\nthe white or sclerotic coat, where it overlaps the border of the\r\ntransparent cornea, is in a measure free from congestion, and, in the\r\nabsence of the obscuring dark pigment, forms a whitish ring around the\r\ncornea. This is partly due to the fact that a series of arteries\r\n(ciliary) passing to the inflamed iris penetrate the sclerotic coat a\r\nshort distance behind its anterior border, and there is therefore a\r\nmarked difference in color between the general sclerotic occupied\r\nbetween these congested vessels and the anterior rim from which they are\r\nabsent. Unfortunately, the pigment is often so abundant in the anterior\r\npart of the sclerotic as to hide this symptom. In internal ophthalmia\r\nthe opacity of the cornea may be confined to a zone around the outer\r\nmargin of the cornea, and even this may be a bluish haze rather than a\r\ndeep, fleecy white. In consequence it becomes impossible to see the\r\ninterior of the chamber for the aqueous humor and the condition of the\r\niris and pupil. The aqueous humor is usually turbid, and has numerous\r\nyellowish-white flakes floating on its substance or deposited in the\r\nlower part of the chamber, so as to cut off the view of the lower\r\nportion of the iris. The still visible portion of the iris has lost its\r\nnatural, clear, dark luster, which is replaced by a brownish or\r\nyellowish sere-leaf color. This is more marked in proportion as the iris\r\nis inflamed, and less so as the inflammation is confined to the choroid.\r\nThe quantity of flocculent deposit in the chamber of the aqueous humor\r\nis also in direct ratio to the inflammation of the iris. Perhaps the\r\nmost marked feature of internal ophthalmia is the extreme and painful\r\nsensitiveness to light. On this account the lids are usually closed, but\r\nwhen opened the pupil is seen to be narrowly closed, even if the animal\r\nhas been kept in a darkened stall. Exceptions to this are seen when\r\ninflammatory effusion has overfilled the globe of the eye, and by\r\npressure on the retina has paralyzed it, or when the exudation into the\r\nsubstance of the retina itself has similarly led to its paralysis. Then\r\nthe pupil may be dilated, and frequently its margin loses its regular,\r\novoid outline and becomes uneven by reason of the adhesions which it has\r\ncontracted with the capsule of the lens, through its inflammatory\r\nexudations. In the case of excessive effusion into the globe of the eye\r\nthat is found to have become tense and hard so that it can not be\r\nindented with the tip of the finger, paralysis of the retina is liable\r\nto result. With such paralysis of the retina, vision is heavily clouded\r\nor entirely lost; hence, in spite of the open pupil, the finger may be\r\napproached to the eye without the animal's becoming conscious of it\r\nuntil it touches the surface, and if the nose on the affected side is\r\ngently struck and a feint made to repeat the blow the patient makes no\r\neffort to evade it. Sometimes the edges of the contracted pupil become\r\nadherent to each other by an intervening plastic exudation, and the\r\nopening becomes virtually abolished. In severe inflammations pus may\r\nform in the choroid or iris, and escaping into the cavity of the aqueous\r\nhumor show as a yellowish-white stratum below. In nearly all cases there\r\nis resulting exudation into the lens or its capsule, constituting a\r\ncloudiness or opacity (cataract), which in severe and old-standing cases\r\nappears as a white, fleecy mass behind a widely dilated pupil. In the\r\nslighter cases cataract is to be recognized by examination of the eye in\r\na dark chamber, with an oblique side light, as described in the\r\nintroduction to this article. Cataracts that appear as a simple haze or\r\nindefinite, fleecy cloud are usually on the capsule (capsular), while\r\nthose that show a radiating arrangement are in the lens (lenticular),\r\nthe radiating fibers of which the exudate follows. Black cataracts are\r\nformed by the adhesion of the pigment on the back of the iris to the\r\nfront of the lens, and by the subsequent tearing loose of the iris,\r\nleaving a portion of its pigment adherent to the capsule of the lens. If\r\nthe pupil is so contracted that it is impossible to see the lens, it may\r\nbe dilated by applying to the front of the eye with a feather some drops\r\nof a solution of 4 grains of atropia in an ounce of water.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment of internal ophthalmia should embrace,\r\nfirst, the removal of all existing causes or sources of aggravation of\r\nthe disease, which need not be repeated here. Special care to protect\r\nthe patient against strong light, cold, wet weather, and active exertion\r\nmust, however, be insisted on. A dark stall and a cloth hung over the\r\neye are important, while cleanliness, warmth, dryness, and rest are\r\nequally demanded. If the patient is strong and vigorous, a dose of 4\r\ndrams of Barbados aloes may be given, and if there is any reason to\r\nsuspect a rheumatic origin one-half a dram powdered colchicum and\r\none-half ounce salicylate of soda may be given daily. Locally the\r\nastringent lotions advised for external ophthalmia may be resorted to,\r\nespecially when the superficial inflammation is well marked. More\r\nimportant, however, is to instill into the eye, a few drops at a time, a\r\nsolution of 4 grains of atropia in 1 ounce of distilled water. This may\r\nbe effected with the aid of a soft feather, and may be repeated at\r\nintervals of 10 minutes until the pupil is widely dilated. As the horse\r\nis to be kept in a dark stall, the consequent admission of light will be\r\nharmless, and the dilation of the pupil prevents adhesion between the\r\niris and lens, relieves the constant tension of the eye in the effort to\r\nadapt the pupil to the light, and solicits the contraction of the blood\r\nvessels of the eye and the lessening of congestion, exudation, and\r\nintraocular pressure. Should atropia not agree with the case, it may be\r\nreplaced by morphia (same strength) or cocaine in 4 per cent solution.\r\nAnother local measure is a blister, which can usually be applied to\r\nadvantage on the side of the nose or beneath the ear. Spanish flies may\r\nbe used as for external ophthalmia. In very severe cases the parts\r\nbeneath the eye may be shaved and three or four leeches applied. Setons\r\nare sometimes beneficial, and even puncture of the eyeball, but these\r\nshould be reserved for professional hands.\r\n\r\nThe diet throughout should be easily digestible and moderate in\r\nquantity--bran mash, middlings, grass, steamed hay, etc.\r\n\r\nEven after the active inflammation has subsided the atropia lotion\r\nshould be continued for several weeks to keep the eye in a state of rest\r\nin its still weak and irritable condition, and during this period the\r\npatient should be kept in semidarkness, or taken out only with a dark\r\nshade over the eye. For the same reason heavy drafts and, rapid paces,\r\nwhich would cause congestion of the head, should be carefully avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECURRENT OPHTHALMIA (PERIODIC OPHTHALMIA, OR MOON-BLINDNESS).\r\n\r\nThis is an inflammatory affection of the interior of the eye, intimately\r\nrelated to certain soils, climates, and systems, showing a strong\r\ntendency to recur again and again, and usually ending in blindness from\r\ncataract or other serious injury.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Its causes may be fundamentally attributed to soil. On damp\r\nclays and marshy grounds, on the frequently overflowed river bottoms and\r\ndeltas, on the coasts of seas and lakes alternately submerged and\r\nexposed, this disease prevails extensively, and in many instances in\r\nFrance (Reynal), Belgium, Alsace (Zundel, Miltenberger), Germany, and\r\nEngland it has very largely decreased under land drainage and improved\r\nmethods of culture. Other influences, more or less associated with such\r\nsoil, are potent causative factors. Thus damp air and a cloudy, wet\r\nclimate, so constantly associated with wet lands, are universally\r\ncharged with causing the disease. These act on the animal body to\r\nproduce a lymphatic constitution with an excess of connective tissue,\r\nbones, and muscles of coarse, open texture, thick skins, and gummy legs\r\ncovered with a profusion of long hair. Hence the heavy horses of Belgium\r\nand southwestern France have suffered severely from the affection, while\r\nhigh, dry lands adjacent, like Catalonia, in Spain, and Dauphiny,\r\nProvence, and Languedoc; in France, have in the main escaped.\r\n\r\nThe rank, aqueous fodders grown on such soils are other causes, but\r\nthese again are calculated to undermine the character of the nervous and\r\nsanguineous temperament and to superinduce the lymphatic. Other feeds\r\nact by leading to constipation and other disorders of the digestive\r\norgans, thus impairing the general health. Hence in any animal\r\npredisposed to this disease, heating, starchy feeds, such as maize,\r\nwheat, and buckwheat, are to be carefully avoided. It has been widely\r\ncharged that beans, peas, vetches, and other Leguminosae are dangerous,\r\nbut a fuller inquiry contradicts the statement. If these feeds are well\r\ngrown, they invigorate and fortify the system, while, like any other\r\nfodder, if grown rank; aqueous, and deficient in assimilable principles,\r\nthey tend to lower the health and open the way for the disease.\r\n\r\nThe period of dentition and training is a fertile exciting cause, for\r\nthough the malady may appear at any time from birth to old age, yet the\r\ngreat majority of victims are from 2 to 6 years old, and if a horse\r\nescapes the affection till after 6 there is a reasonable hope that he\r\nwill continue to resist it. The irritation about the head during the\r\neruption of the teeth, and while fretting in the unwonted bridle and\r\ncollar, the stimulating grain diet and the close air of the stable all\r\ncombine to rouse the latent tendency to disease in the eye, while direct\r\ninjuries by bridle, whip, or hay seeds are not without their influence.\r\nIn the same way local irritants, like dust, severe rain and snow storms,\r\nsmoke, and acrid vapors are contributing causes.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, however, that no one of these is sufficient of itself to\r\nproduce the disease, and it has been alleged that the true cause is a\r\nmicrobe, or the irritant products of a microbe, which is harbored in the\r\nmarshy soil. The prevalence of the disease on the same damp soils which\r\nproduce ague in man and anthrax in cattle has been quoted in support of\r\nthis doctrine, as also the fact that, other things being equal, the\r\nmalady is always more prevalent in basins surrounded by hills where the\r\nair is still and such products are concentrated, and that a forest or\r\nsimple belt of trees will, as in ague, at times limit the area of its\r\nprevalence. Another argument for the same view is found in the fact that\r\non certain farms irrigated by town sewage this malady has become\r\nextremely prevalent, the sewage being assumed to form a suitable nidus\r\nfor the growth of the germ. But on these sewage farms a fresh crop may\r\nbe cut every fortnight, and the product is precisely that aqueous\r\nmaterial which contributes to a lymphatic structure and a low tone of\r\nhealth. The presence of a definite germ in the system has not yet been\r\nproved, and in the present state of our knowledge we are only warranted\r\nin charging the disease to the deleterious emanations from the marshy\r\nsoil in which bacterial ferments are constantly producing them.\r\n\r\nHeredity is one of the most potent causes. The lymphatic constitution is\r\nof course transmitted and with it the proclivity to recurring\r\nophthalmia. This is notorious in the case of both parents, male and\r\nfemale. The tendency appears to be stronger, however, if either parent\r\nhas already suffered. Thus a mare may have borne a number of sound\r\nfoals, and then fallen a victim to the malady, and all foals\r\nsubsequently borne have likewise suffered. So it is in the case of the\r\nstallion. Reynal even quotes the appearance of the disease in alternate\r\ngenerations, the stallion offspring of blind parents remaining sound\r\nthrough life and yet producing foals which furnish numerous victims of\r\nrecurrent ophthalmia. On the contrary, the offspring of diseased parents\r\nremoved to high, dry regions and furnished with wholesome, nourishing\r\nrations will nearly all escape. Hence the dealers take colts that are\r\nstill sound or have had but one attack from the affected low Pyrenees\r\n(France) to the unaffected Catalonia (Spain), with confidence that they\r\nwill escape, and from the Jura Valley to Dauphiny with the same result.\r\n\r\nYet the hereditary taint is so strong and pernicious that intelligent\r\nhorsemen everywhere refuse to breed from either horse or mare that has\r\nonce suffered from recurrent ophthalmia, and the French Government studs\r\nnot only reject all unsound stallions, but refuse service to any mare\r\nwhich has suffered with her eyes. It is this avoidance of the hereditary\r\npredisposition more than anything else that has reduced the formerly\r\nwide prevalence of this disease in the European countries generally. A\r\nconsideration for the future of our horses would demand the disuse of\r\nall sires that are unlicensed, and the refusal of a license to any sire\r\nwhich has suffered from this or any other communicable constitutional\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nOther contributing causes deserve passing mention. Unwholesome feed and\r\na faulty method of feeding undoubtedly predisposes to the disease, and\r\nin the same district the carefully fed will escape in far larger\r\nproportion than the badly fed; it is so also with every other condition\r\nwhich undermines the general health. The presence of worms in the\r\nintestines, overwork, and debilitating diseases and causes of every kind\r\nweaken the vitality and lay the system more open to attack. Thierry long\r\nago showed that the improvement of close, low, dark, damp stables, where\r\nthe disease had previously prevailed, practically banished the\r\naffection. Whatever contributes to strength and vigor is protective;\r\nwhatever contributes to weakness and poor health is provocative of the\r\ndisease in the predisposed subject.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms vary according to the severity of the attack.\r\nIn some cases there is marked fever, and in some slighter cases it may\r\nbe almost altogether wanting, but there is always a lack of vigor and\r\nenergy, bespeaking general disorder. The local symptoms are in the main\r\nthose of internal ophthalmia, in many cases with an increased hardness\r\nof the eyeball from effusion into its cavity. The contracted pupil does\r\nnot expand much in darkness, nor even under the action of belladonna.\r\nOpacity advances from the margin, over a part or whole of the cornea,\r\nbut so long as it is transparent there may be seen the turbid, aqueous\r\nhumor with or without flocculi, the dingy iris robbed of its clear,\r\nblack aspect, the slightly clouded lens, and a greenish-yellow\r\nreflection from the depth of the eye. From the fifth to the seventh day\r\nthe flocculi precipitate in the lower part of the chamber, exposing more\r\nclearly the iris and lens, and absorption commences, so that the eye may\r\nbe cleared up in ten or fifteen days.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic of the disease is, however, its recurrence again and\r\nagain in the same eye until blindness results. The attacks may follow\r\none another after intervals of a month, more or less, but they show no\r\nrelation to any particular phase of the moon, as might be inferred from\r\nthe familiar name, but are determined rather by the weather, the health,\r\nthe feed, or by some periodicity of the system. From five to seven\r\nattacks usually result in blindness, and then the second eye is liable\r\nto be attacked until it also is ruined.\r\n\r\nIn the intervals between the attacks some remaining symptoms betray the\r\ncondition, and they become more marked after each successive access of\r\ndisease. Even after the first attack there is a bluish ring around the\r\nmargin of the transparent cornea. The eye seems smaller than the other,\r\nat first because it is retracted in its socket, and often after several\r\nattacks because of actual shrinkage (atrophy). The upper eyelid, in\r\nplace of presenting a uniform, continuous arch, has, about one-third\r\nfrom its inner angle, an abrupt bend, caused by the contraction of the\r\nlevator muscle. The front of the iris has exchanged some of its dark,\r\nclear brilliancy for a lusterless yellow, and the depth of the eye\r\npresents more or less of the greenish-yellow shade. The pupil remains a\r\nlittle contracted, except in advanced and aggravated cases, when, with\r\nopaque lens, it is widely dilated. If, as is common, one eye only has\r\nsuffered, the contrast in these respects with the sound eye is all the\r\nmore characteristic. Another feature is the erect, attentive carriage of\r\nthe ear, to compensate to some extent for the waning vision.\r\n\r\nThe attacks vary greatly in severity in different cases, but the\r\nrecurrence is characteristic, and all alike lead to cataract and\r\nintraocular effusion, with pressure on the retina and abolition of\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--The prevention of this disease is the great object to be\r\naimed at, and this demands the most careful breeding, feeding, housing,\r\nand general management, as indicated under \"Causes.\" Much can also be\r\ndone by migration to a high, dry location, but for this and malarious\r\naffections the improvement of the land by drainage and good cultivation\r\nshould be the final aim.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ is not satisfactory, but is largely the same as for common\r\ninternal ophthalmia. Some cases, like rheumatism, are benefited by\r\n1-scruple doses of powdered colchicum and 2-dram doses of salicylate of\r\nsoda twice a day. In other cases, with marked hardness of the globe of\r\nthe eye from intraocular effusion, aseptic puncture of the eye, or even\r\nthe excision of a portion of the iris, has helped. During recovery a\r\ncourse of tonics (2 drams oxid of iron, 10 grains nux vomica, and 1\r\nounce sulphate of soda daily) is desirable to invigorate the system and\r\nhelp to ward off another attack. The vulgar resort to knocking out the\r\nwolf teeth and cutting out the haw can only be condemned. The temporary\r\nrecovery would take place in one or two weeks, though no such thing had\r\nbeen done, and the breaking of a small tooth, leaving its fang in the\r\njaw, only increases the irritation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATARACT.\r\n\r\nThe common result of internal ophthalmia, as of the recurrent type, may\r\nbe recognized as described under the first of these diseases. Its\r\noffensive appearance may be obviated by extraction or depression of the\r\nlens, but as the rays of light would no longer be properly refracted,\r\nperfect vision would not be restored, and the animal would be liable to\r\nprove an inveterate shyer. If perfect blindness continued by reason of\r\npressure on the nerve of sight, no shying would result.\r\n\r\n\r\nPALSY OF THE NERVE OF SIGHT, OR AMAUROSIS.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--The causes of this affection are tumors or other disease of\r\nthe brain implicating the roots of the optic nerve, injury to the nerve\r\nbetween the brain and eye, and inflammation of the optic nerve within\r\nthe eye (retina), or undue pressure on the same from dropsical or\r\ninflammatory effusion. It may also occur from overloaded stomach, from a\r\nprofuse bleeding, and even from the pressure of the gravid womb in\r\ngestation.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are wide dilatation of the pupils, so as to\r\nexpose fully the interior of the globe, the expansion remaining the\r\nsame in light and darkness. Ordinary eyes when brought to the light have\r\nthe pupils suddenly contract and then dilate and contract alternately\r\nuntil they adapt themselves to the light. The horse does not swerve when\r\na feint to strike is made unless the hand causes a current of air. The\r\nears are held erect, turn quickly toward any noise, and the horse steps\r\nhigh to avoid stumbling over objects which it can not see.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ is only useful when the disease is symptomatic of some\r\nremovable cause, like congested brain, overloaded stomach, or gravid\r\nwomb. When recovery does not follow the termination of these conditions,\r\napply a blister behind the ear and give one-half dram doses of nux\r\nvomica daily.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUMORS OF THE EYEBALL.\r\n\r\nA variety of tumors attack the eyeball--dermoid, papillary, fatty,\r\ncystic, and melanotic--but perhaps the most frequent in the horse is\r\nencephaloid cancer. This may grow in or on the globe, the haw, the\r\neyelid, or the bones of the orbit, and can be remedied, if at all, only\r\nby early and thorough excision. It may be distinguished from the less\r\ndangerous tumors by its softness, friability, and great vascularity,\r\nbleeding on the slightest touch, as well as by its anatomical structure.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAPHYLOMA.\r\n\r\nThis consists in a bulging forward of the cornea at a given point by the\r\nsacculate yielding and distention of its coats, and it may be either\r\ntransparent or opaque and vascular. In the last form the iris has become\r\nadherent to the back of the cornea, and the whole structure is filled\r\nwith blood vessels. In the first form the bulging cornea is attenuated;\r\nin the last it may be thickened. The best treatment is by excision of a\r\nportion of the rise so as to relieve the intraocular pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARASITES IN THE EYE.\r\n\r\nAcari in the eye have been incidentally alluded to under inflammation of\r\nthe lids.\r\n\r\n_Filaria palpebralis_ is a white worm, one-half to 1 inch long, which\r\ninhabits the lacrimal duct and the underside of the eyelids and haw in\r\nthe horse, producing a verminous conjunctivitis. The first step in\r\ntreatment in such cases is to remove the worm with forceps, then treat\r\nas for external inflammation.\r\n\r\n_Setaria equina_ is a delicate, white, silvery-looking worm, which I\r\nhave repeatedly found 2 inches in length (a length as great as 5 inches\r\nhas been reported). It invades the aqueous humor, where its constant\r\nactive movements make it an object of great interest, and it is\r\nfrequently exhibited as a \"snake in the eye.\"[1] When present in the\r\neye it causes inflammation and has to be removed through an incision\r\nmade with the lancet in the upper border of the cornea close to the\r\nsclerotic, the point of the instrument being directed slightly forward\r\nto avoid injury to the iris. Then cold water or astringent antiseptic\r\nlotions should be applied.\r\n\r\n_Filaria conjunctivae_, resembling _Setaria equina_ very much in size and\r\ngeneral appearance, is another roundworm which has been found in the eye\r\nof the horse.\r\n\r\nThe echinococcus, the cystic or larval stage of the echinococcus\r\ntapeworm of the dog, has been found in the eye of the horse, and a\r\ncysticercus is also reported.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] This worm is normally a parasite of the peritoneal cavity, and is\r\nprobably transmitted from one horse to another by some biting insect\r\nwhich becomes infected by embryos in the blood.--M.

M.,\r\n\r\n_Formerly principal of the American Veterinary College, New York._\r\n\r\n[Revised by John R. Mohler, A. M., V. M. D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is as living, organized, locomotive machines that the horse, camel,\r\nox, and their burden-bearing companions are of practical value to man.\r\nHence the consideration of their usefulness and consequent value to\r\ntheir human masters ultimately and naturally resolves itself into an\r\ninquiry concerning the condition of that special portion of their\r\norganism which controls their function of locomotion. This is especially\r\ntrue in regard to the members of the equine family, the most numerous\r\nand valuable of all the beasts of burden, and it naturally follows that\r\nwith the horse for a subject of discussion the special topic and leading\r\ntheme of inquiry, by an easy lapse, will become an inquest into the\r\ncondition and efficiency of his power for usefulness as a carrier or\r\ntraveler. There is a great deal of abstract interest in the study of\r\nthat endowment of the animal economy which enables its possessor to\r\nchange his place at will and convey himself whithersoever his needs or\r\nhis moods may incline him; how much greater, however, the interest that\r\nattaches to the subject when it becomes a practical and economic\r\nquestion and includes within its purview the various related topics\r\nwhich belong to the domains of physiology, pathology, therapeutics, and\r\nthe entire round of scientific investigation into which it is finally\r\nmerged as a subject for medical and surgical consideration--in a word,\r\nof actual disease and its treatment. It is not surprising that the\r\nintricate and complicated apparatus of locomotion, with its symmetry and\r\nharmony of movement and the perfection and beauty of its details and\r\nadjuncts, by students of creative design and attentive observers or\r\nnature and her marvelous contrivances and adaptations, should be\r\nadmiringly denominated a living machine.\r\n\r\nOf all the animal tribe the horse, in a state of domesticity, is the\r\nlargest sharer with his master in his liability to the accidents and\r\ndangers which are among the incidents of civilized life. From his\r\nexposure to the missiles of war on the battlefield to his chance of\r\npicking up a nail from the city pavement there is no hour when he is\r\nnot in danger of incurring injuries which for their repair may demand\r\nthe best skill of the veterinary practitioner. This is true not alone of\r\ncasualties which belong to the class of external and traumatic cases,\r\nbut includes as well those of a kind perhaps more numerous, which may\r\nresult in lesions of internal parts, frequently the most serious and\r\nobscure of all in their nature and effects.\r\n\r\nThe horse is too important a factor in the practical details of human\r\nlife and fills too large a place in the business and pleasure of the\r\nworld to justify any indifference to his needs and physical comfort or\r\nneglect in respect to the preservation of his peculiar powers for\r\nusefulness. In entering somewhat largely, therefore, upon a review of\r\nthe subject, and treating in detail of the causes, the symptoms, the\r\nprogress, the treatment, the results, and the consequences of lameness\r\nin the horse, we are performing a duty which needs no word of apology or\r\njustification. The subject explains and justifies itself, and is its own\r\nvindication and illustration, if any are needed.\r\n\r\nThe function of locomotion is performed by the action of two principal\r\nsystems of organs, known in anatomical and physiological terminology as\r\npassive and active, the muscles performing the active and the bones the\r\npassive portion of the movement. The necessary connection between the\r\ncooperating parts of the organism is effected by means of a vital\r\ncontact by which the muscle is attached to the bone at certain\r\ndeterminate points on the surface of the latter. These points of\r\nattachment appear sometimes as an eminence, sometimes as a depression,\r\nsometimes a border or an angle, or again as a mere roughness, but each\r\nperfectly fulfilling its purpose, while the necessary motion is provided\r\nfor by the formation of the ends of the long bones into the requisite\r\narticulations, joints, or hinges. Every motion is the product of the\r\ncontraction of one or more of the muscles, which, as it acts upon the\r\nbony levers, gives rise to a movement of extension or flexion, abduction\r\nor adduction, rotation or circumduction. The movement of abduction is\r\nthat which passes from and that of adduction that which passes toward\r\nthe median line, or the center of the body. The movements of flexion and\r\nextension are too well understood to need defining. It is the\r\ncombination and rapid alterations of these movements which produce the\r\ndifferent postures and various gaits of the animal, and it is their\r\ninterruption and derangement, from whatever causes, which constitute the\r\npathological condition known as lameness.\r\n\r\nA concise examination of the general anatomy of these organs, however,\r\nmust precede the consideration of the pathological questions pertaining\r\nto the subject. A statement, such as we have just given, containing only\r\nthe briefest hint of matters which, though not necessarily in their\r\nultimate scientific minutiae, must be clearly comprehended in order to\r\nacquire a symmetrical and satisfactory view of the theme as a practical\r\ncollation of facts to be remembered, analyzed, applied, and utilized.\r\n\r\nIt was the great Bacon who wrote: \"The human body may be compared, from\r\nits complex and delicate organization, to a musical instrument of the\r\nmost perfect construction, but exceedingly liable to derangement.\" In\r\nits degree the remark is equally applicable to the equine body, and if\r\nwe would keep it in tune and profit by its harmonious action we must at\r\nleast acquaint ourselves with the relations of its parts and the mode of\r\ntheir cooperation.\r\n\r\n\r\nANATOMY.\r\n\r\nThe bones, then, are the hard organs which in their connection and\r\ntotality constitute the skeleton of an animal (see Plate XXIII). They\r\nare of various forms, three of which--the long, the flat, and the\r\nsmall--are recognized in the extremities. These are more or less regular\r\nin their form, but present upon their surfaces a variety of aspects,\r\nexhibiting in turn, according to the requirement of each case, a\r\nroughened or smooth surface, variously marked with grooves, crests,\r\neminences, and depressions, for the necessary muscular attachments, and,\r\nas before mentioned, are connected by articulations and joints, of which\r\nsome are immovable and others movable.\r\n\r\nThe substance of the bone is composed of a mass of combined earthy and\r\nanimal matter surrounded by a fine, fibrous enveloping membrane (the\r\nperiosteum) which is intimately adherent to the external surface of the\r\nbone, and is, in fact, the secreting membrane of the bony structure. The\r\nbony tissue proper is of two consistencies, the external portion being\r\nhard and \"compact,\" and called by the latter term, while the internal,\r\nknown as the \"spongy\" or \"areolar tissue,\" corresponds to the\r\ndescriptive terms. Those of the bones that possess this latter\r\nconsistency contain also, in their spongy portion, the medullary\r\nsubstance known as marrow, which is deposited in large quantities in the\r\ninterior of the long bones, and especially where a central cavity\r\nexists, called, for that reason, the medullary cavity. The nourishment\r\nof the bones is effected by means of what is known as the nutrient\r\nforamen, an opening established for the passage of the blood vessels\r\nwhich convey the nourishment necessary to the interior of the organ.\r\nConcerning the nourishment of the skeleton, there are other minutiae,\r\nsuch as the venous arrangement and the classification of their arterial\r\nvessels into several orders, which, though of interest as an abstract\r\nstudy, are not of sufficient practical value to refer to here.\r\n\r\nThe active organs of locomotion, the muscles (see Plate XXIII), speaking\r\ngenerally, form the fleshy covering of the external part of the skeleton\r\nand surround the bones of the extremities. They vary greatly in shape\r\nand size, being flat, triangular, long, short, or broad, and are\r\nvariously and capriciously named, some from their shape, some from their\r\nsituation, others from their use; and thus we have abductors and\r\nadductors--the pyramidal, orbicular, the digastricus, the vastus, and so\r\non. Those which are under the control of the will, known as the\r\nvoluntary muscles, appear in the form of fleshy structures, red in\r\ncolor, and with fibers of various degrees of fineness, and are composed\r\nof fasciculi, or bundles of fibers, united by connective or cellular\r\ntissue, each fasciculus being composed of smaller ones but united in a\r\nsimilar manner to compose the larger formations, each of which is\r\nenveloped by a structure of similar nature known as the sarcolemma. Many\r\nof the muscles are united to the bones by the direct contact of their\r\nfleshy fibers, but in other instances the body of the muscle is more or\r\nless gradually transformed into a cordy or membranous structure known as\r\nthe tendon or sinew, and the attachment is made by the very short\r\nfibrous threads through the medium of a long tendinous band, which,\r\npassing from a single one to several others of the bones, effects its\r\nobject at a point far distant from its original attachment. In thus\r\ncarrying its action from one bone to another, or from one region of a\r\nlimb to another, these tendons must necessarily have smooth surfaces\r\nover which to glide, either upon the bones themselves or formed at their\r\narticulations, and this need is supplied by the secretion of the\r\nsynovial fluid, a yellowish, unctuous substance, furnished by a peculiar\r\ntendinous synovial sac designed for the purpose.\r\n\r\nIllustrations in point of the agency of the synovial fluid in assisting\r\nthe sliding movements of the tendons may be found under their various\r\nforms at the shoulder joint, at the upper part of the bone of the arm,\r\nat the posterior part of the knee joint, and also at the fetlocks, on\r\ntheir posterior part.\r\n\r\nAs the tendons, whether singly or in company with others, pass over\r\nthese natural pulleys they are retained in place by strong, fibrous\r\nbands or sheaths, which are by no means exempt from danger of injury, as\r\nwill be readily inferred from a consideration of their important special\r\nuse as supports and reenforcements of the tendons themselves, with which\r\nthey must necessarily share the stress of whatever force or strain is\r\nbrought to bear upon both or either.\r\n\r\nWe have referred to that special formation of the external surface of a\r\nbone by which it is adapted to form a joint or articulation, either\r\nmovable or fixed, and a concise examination of the formation and\r\nstructure of the movable articulations will here be in place. These are\r\nformed generally by the extremities of the long bones, or may exist on\r\nthe surfaces of the short ones. The points or regions where the contact\r\noccurs are denominated the articular surface, which assumes from this\r\ncircumstance a considerable variety of aspect and form, being in one\r\ncase comparatively flat and another elevated; or as forming a protruding\r\nhead or knob, with a distinct convexity; and again presenting a\r\ncorresponding depression or cavity, accurately adapted to complete, by\r\ntheir coaptation, the ball-and-socket joint. The articulation of the arm\r\nand shoulder is an example of the first kind, while that of the hip with\r\nthe thigh bone is a perfect exhibition of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe structure whose office it is to retain the articulating surfaces in\r\nplace is the ligament. This is usually a white, fibrous, inelastic\r\ntissue; sometimes, however, it is elastic in character and yellowish. In\r\nsome instances it is funicular shaped or corded, serving to bind more\r\nfirmly together the bones to which its extremities are attached; in\r\nothers it consists of a broad membrane, wholly or partially surrounding\r\nthe broad articulations, and calculated rather for the protection of the\r\ncavity from intrusion by the air than for other security. This latter\r\nform, known as capsular, is usually found in connection with joints\r\nwhich possess a free and extended movement. The capsular and funicular\r\nligaments are sometimes associated, the capsular appearing as a\r\nmembranous sac wholly or partially inclosing the joint, the funicular,\r\nhere known as an interarticular ligament, occupying the interior, and\r\nthus securing the union of the several bones more firmly and effectively\r\nthan would be possible for the capsular ligament unassisted.\r\n\r\nThe universal need which pertains to all mechanical contrivances of\r\nmotion has not been forgotten while providing for the perfect working of\r\nthe interesting piece of living machinery which performs the function of\r\nlocomotion, as we are contemplating it, and nature has consequently\r\nprovided for obviating the evils of attrition and friction and insuring\r\nthe easy play and smooth movement of its parts by the establishment of\r\nthe secretion of the synovia, the vital lubricant of which we have\r\nbefore spoken, as a yellow, oily, or rather glairy secretion, which\r\nperforms the indispensable office of facilitating the play of the\r\ntendons over the joints and certain given points of the bones. This\r\nfluid is deposited in a containing sac, the lining (serous) membrane of\r\nwhich forms the secreting organ. This membrane is of an excessively\r\nsensitive nature, and while it lines the inner face of the ligaments,\r\nboth capsular and fascicular, it is attached only upon the edges of the\r\nbones, without extending upon their length, or between the layers of\r\ncartilage which lie between the bones and their articular surfaces.\r\n\r\nOur object in thus partially and concisely reviewing the structure and\r\ncondition of the essential organs of locomotion has been rather to\r\noutline a sketch which may serve as a reference chart of the general\r\nfeatures of the subject than to offer a minute description of the parts\r\nreferred to. Other points of interest will receive proper attention as\r\nwe proceed with the illustration of our subject and examine the matters\r\nwhich it most concerns us to bring under consideration. The foundation\r\nof facts which we have thus far prepared will be found sufficiently\r\nbroad, we trust, to include whatever may be necessary to insure a ready\r\ncomprehension of the essential matters which are to follow as our review\r\nis carried forward to completion. What we have said touching these\r\nelementary truths will probably be sufficient to facilitate a clear\r\nunderstanding of the requirements essential to the perfection and\r\nregularity which characterize the normal performance of the various\r\nmovements that result in the accomplishment of the action of locomotion.\r\nSo long as the bones, the muscles and their tendons, the joints with\r\ntheir cartilages, their ligaments, and their synovial structure, the\r\nnerves and the controlling influences which they exercise over all, with\r\nthe blood vessels which distribute to every part, however minute, the\r\nvitalizing fluid which sustains the whole fabric in being and\r\nactivity--so long as these various constituents and adjuncts of animal\r\nlife preserve their normal exemption from disease, traumatism, and\r\npathological change, the function of locomotion will continue to be\r\nperformed with perfection and efficiency.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, let any element of disease become implanted in one or\r\nseveral of the parts destined for combined action, any change or\r\nirregularity of form, dimensions, location, or action occur in any\r\nportion of the apparatus--any obstruction or misdirection of vital power\r\ntake place, any interference with the order of the phenomena of normal\r\nnature, any loss of harmony and lack of balance be betrayed--and we have\r\nin the result the condition of lameness.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF LAMENESS.\r\n\r\n_Physiology._--Comprehensively and universally considered, then, the\r\nterm lameness signifies any irregularity or derangement of the function\r\nof locomotion, irrespective of the cause which produced it or the degree\r\nof its manifestation. However slightly or severely it may be exhibited,\r\nit is all the same. The nicest observation may be demanded for its\r\ndetection, and it may need the most thoroughly trained powers of\r\ndiscernment to identify and locate it, as in cases in which the animal\r\nis said to be fainting, tender, or to go sore. On the contrary, the\r\npatient may be so far affected as to refuse utterly to use an injured\r\nleg, and under compulsory motion keep it raised from the ground, and\r\nprefer to travel on three legs rather than to bear any portion of his\r\nweight upon the afflicted member. In these two extremes, and in all the\r\nintermediate degrees, the patient is simply lame--pathognomonic minutiae\r\nbeing considered and settled in a place of their own.\r\n\r\nThis last condition of disabled function--lameness on three legs--and\r\nmany of the lower degrees of simple lameness are very easy of detection,\r\nbut the first, or mere tenderness or soreness, may be very difficult to\r\nidentify, and at times very serious results have followed from the\r\nobscurity which has enveloped the early stages of the malady. For it may\r\neasily occur that in the absence of the treatment which an early correct\r\ndiagnosis would have indicated, an insidious ailment may so take\r\nadvantage of the lapse of time as to root itself too deeply into the\r\neconomy to be subverted, and become transformed into a disabling chronic\r\ncase, or possibly one that is incurable and fatal. Hence the impolicy of\r\ndepreciating early symptoms because they are not accompanied with\r\ndistinct and pronounced characteristics, and from a lack of threatening\r\nappearances inferring the absence of danger. The possibilities of an\r\nambush can never be safely ignored. An extra caution costs nothing, even\r\nif wasted. The fulfillment of the first duty of a practitioner, when\r\nintroduced to a case, is not always an easy task, though it is too\r\nfrequently expected that the diagnosis, or \"what is the matter\" verdict,\r\nwill be reached by the quickest and surest kind of an \"instantaneous\r\nprocess\" and a sure prognosis, or \"how will it end,\" guessed at\r\ninstanter.\r\n\r\nUsually the discovery that the animal is becoming lame is comparatively\r\nan easy matter to a careful observer. Such a person will readily note\r\nthe changes of movements which will have taken place in the animal he\r\nhas been accustomed to drive or ride, unless they are indeed slight and\r\nlimited to the last degree. But what is not always easy is the\r\ndetection, after discovering the fact of an existing irregularity, of\r\nthe locality of its point of origin, and whether its seat be in the near\r\nor off leg, or in the fore or the hind part of the body. These are\r\nquestions too often wrongly answered, notwithstanding the fact that with\r\na little careful scrutiny the point may be easily settled. The error,\r\nwhich is too often committed, of pronouncing the leg upon which the\r\nanimal travels soundly as the seat of the lameness, is the result of a\r\nmisinterpretation of the physiology of locomotion in the crippled\r\nanimal. Much depends upon the gait with which the animal moves while\r\nunder examination. The act of walking is unfavorable for accurate\r\nobservation, though, if the animal walks on three legs, the decision is\r\neasy to reach. The action of galloping will often, by the rapidity of\r\nthe muscular movements and their quick succession, interfere with a nice\r\nstudy of their rhythm, and it is only under some peculiar circumstances\r\nthat the examination can be safely conducted while the animal is moving\r\nwith that gait. It is while the animal is trotting that the\r\ninvestigation is made with the best chances of an intelligent decision,\r\nand it is while moving with that gait, therefore, that the points should\r\nbe looked for which must form the elements of the diagnosis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIII.\r\n\r\nSKELETON OF HORSE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIV.\r\n\r\nSUPERFICIAL LAYER OF MUSCLES.]\r\n\r\nOur first consideration should be the physiology of normal or healthy\r\nlocomotion, that thence we may the more easily reach our conclusions\r\ntouching lameness, or that which is abnormal, and by this process we\r\nought to succeed in obtaining a clew to the solution of the first\r\nproblem, to wit, in which leg is the seat of the lameness?\r\n\r\nA word of definition is here necessary, in order to render that which\r\nfollows more easily intelligible. In veterinary nomenclature each two of\r\nthe legs, as referred to in pairs, is denominated a biped. Of the four\r\npoints occupied by the feet of the animal while standing at rest,\r\nforming a square, the two fore legs are known as the anterior biped; the\r\ntwo hinder, the posterior; the two on one side, the lateral: and one of\r\neither the front or hind biped with the opposite leg of the hind or\r\nfront biped will form the diagonal biped.\r\n\r\nConsidering, as it is proper to do, that in a condition of health each\r\nseparate biped and each individual leg is required to perform an equal\r\nand uniform function and to carry an even or equal portion of the weight\r\nof the body, it will be readily appreciated that the result of this\r\ndistribution will be a regular, evenly balanced, and smooth displacement\r\nof the body thus supported by the four legs, and that therefore,\r\naccording to the rapidity of the motion in different gaits, each single\r\nleg will be required at certain successive moments to bear the weight\r\nwhich had rested upon its congener while it was itself in the air, in\r\nthe act of moving; or, again, two different legs of a biped may be\r\ncalled upon to bear the weight of the two legs of the opposite biped\r\nwhile also in the air in the act of moving.\r\n\r\nTo simplify the matter by an illustration, the weight of an animal may\r\nbe placed at 1,000 pounds, of which each leg, in a normal and healthy\r\ncondition, supports while at rest 250 pounds. When one of the fore legs\r\nis in action, or in the air, and carrying no weight, its 250 pounds\r\nshare of the weight will be thrown upon its congener, or partner, to\r\nsustain. If the two legs of a biped are both in action and raised from\r\nthe ground, their congeners, still resting in inaction, will carry the\r\ntotal weight of the other two, or 500 pounds. And as the succession of\r\nmovements continues, and the change from one leg to another or from one\r\nbiped to another, as may be required by the gait, proceeds, there will\r\nresult a smooth, even, and equal balancing of active movements, shifting\r\nthe weight from one leg or one biped to another, with symmetrical\r\nprecision, and we shall be presented with an interesting example of the\r\nplay of vital machanics in a healthy organization.\r\n\r\nMuch may be learned from the accurate study of the action of a single\r\nleg. Normally, its movements will be without variation or failure. When\r\nat rest it will easily sustain the weight assigned to it without\r\nshowing hesitancy or betraying pain, and when it is raised from the\r\nground in order to transfer the weight to its mate it will perform the\r\nact in such manner that when it is again placed upon the ground to rest\r\nit will be with a firm tread, indicative of its ability to receive again\r\nthe burden to be thrown back upon it. In planting it upon the ground or\r\nraising it again for the forward movement while in action, and again\r\nreplanting it upon the earth, each movement will be the same for each\r\nleg and for each biped, whether the act is that of walking or trotting,\r\nor even of galloping. In short, the regular play of every part of the\r\napparatus will testify to the existence of that condition of orderly\r\nsoundness and efficient activity eloquently suggestive of the condition\r\nof vital integrity which is simply but comprehensively expressed by the\r\nterms health and soundness.\r\n\r\nBut let some change, though slight and obscure, occur among the elements\r\nof the case; some invisible agency of evil intrude among the harmonizing\r\nprocesses going forward; any disorder occur in the relations of\r\ncooperating parts; anything appear to neutralize the efficiency of\r\nvitalizing forces; any disability of a limb to accept and to throw back\r\nupon its mate the portion of the weight which belongs to it to\r\nsustain--present itself, whether as the effect of accident or otherwise;\r\nin short, let anything develop which tends to defeat the purpose of\r\nnature in organizing the locomotive apparatus and we are confronted at\r\nonce by that which may be looked upon as a cause of lameness.\r\n\r\nNot the least of the facts which it is important to remember is that it\r\nis not sufficient to look for the manifestation of an existing\r\ndiscordance in the action of the affected limb alone, but that it is\r\nshared by the sound one and must be searched for in that as well as the\r\nhalting member, if the hazard of an error is to be avoided. The mode of\r\naction of the leg which is the seat of the lameness will vary greatly\r\nfrom that which it exhibited when in a healthy condition, and the sound\r\nleg will also offer important modifications in the same three\r\nparticulars before alluded to, to wit, that of resting on the ground,\r\nthat of its elevation and forward motion, and that of striking the\r\nground again when the full action of stepping is accomplished. Inability\r\nin the lame leg to sustain weight will imply excessive exertion by the\r\nsound one, and lack of facility or disposition to rest the lame member\r\non the ground will necessitate a longer continuance of that action on\r\nthe sound side. Changes in the act of elevating the leg, or of carrying\r\nit forward, or in both, will present entirely opposite conditions\r\nbetween the two. The lame member will be elevated rapidly, moved\r\ncarefully forward, and returned to the ground with caution and\r\nhesitancy, and the contact with the earth will be effected as lightly as\r\npossible, while the sound limb will rest longer on the ground, move\r\nboldly and rapidly forward, and strike the ground promptly and forcibly.\r\nAll this is due to the fact that the sound member carries more than its\r\nnormal, healthy share of the weight of the body, a share which may be in\r\nexcess from 1 to 250 pounds, and thus bring its burden to a figure\r\nvarying from 251 to 500 pounds, all depending upon the degree of the\r\nexisting lameness, whether it is simply a slight tenderness or soreness,\r\nor whether the trouble has reached a stage which compels the patient to\r\nthe awkwardness of traveling on three legs.\r\n\r\nThat all this is not mere theory, but rests on a foundation of fact may\r\nbe established by observing the manifestations attending a single\r\nalteration in the balancing of the body. In health the support and\r\nequilibrium of that mass of the body which is borne by the fore legs is\r\nequalized and passes by regular alternations from the right to the left\r\nside and vice versa. But if the left leg, becoming disabled, relieves\r\nitself by leaning, as it were, on the right, the latter becomes,\r\nconsequently, practically heavier and the mass of the body will incline\r\nor settle upon that side. Lameness of the left side, therefore, means\r\ndropping or settling on the right and vice versa. We emphasize this\r\nstatement and insist upon it, the more from the frequency of the\r\ninstances of error which have come under our notice, in which persons\r\nhave insisted upon their view that the leg which is the seat of the\r\nlameness is that upon which he drops and which the animal is usually\r\nsupposed to favor.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO DETECT THE SEAT OF LAMENESS.\r\n\r\nProperly appreciating the remarks which have preceded, and fully\r\ncomprehending the modus operandi and the true pathology of lameness, but\r\nlittle remains to be done in order to reach an answer to the question as\r\nto which side of the animal is the seat of the lameness, except to\r\nexamine the patient while in action. We have already stated our reasons\r\nfor preferring the movement of trotting for this purpose. In conducting\r\nsuch an examination the animal should be unblanketed, and held by a\r\nplain halter in the hands of a man who knows how to manage his paces,\r\nand the trial should always be made over a firm, hard road whenever it\r\nis available. He is to be examined from various positions--from before,\r\nfrom behind, and from each side. Watching him as he approaches, as he\r\npasses by, and as he recedes, the observer should carefully study that\r\nimportant action which we have spoken of as the dropping of the body\r\nupon one extremity or the other, and this can readily be detected by\r\nattending closely to the motions of the head and of the hip. The head\r\ndrops on the same side on which the mass of the body will fall, dropping\r\ntoward the right when the lameness is in the left fore leg, and the hip\r\ndropping in posterior lameness, also on the sound leg, the reversal of\r\nthe conditions, of course, producing reversed effects. In other words,\r\nwhen the animal in trotting exhibits signs of irregularity of action, or\r\nlameness, and this irregularity is accompanied with dropping or nodding\r\nthe head, or depressing the hip on the right side of the body, at the\r\ntime the feet of the right side strike the ground, the horse is lame on\r\nthe left side. If the dropping and nodding are on the near side the\r\nlameness is on the off side.\r\n\r\nIn a majority of cases, however, the answer to the first question\r\nrelating to the lameness of a horse is, after all, not a very difficult\r\ntask. There are two other problems in the case more difficult of\r\nsolution and which often require the exercise of a closer scrutiny, and\r\ndraw upon all the resources of the experienced practitioner to settle\r\nsatisfactorily. That a horse is lame in a given leg may be easily\r\ndetermined, but when it becomes necessary to pronounce upon the query as\r\nto what part, what region, what structure is affected, the easy part of\r\nthe task is over, and the more difficult and important, because more\r\nobscure, portion of the investigation has commenced--except, of course,\r\nin cases of which the features are too distinctly evident to the senses\r\nto admit of error. It is true that by carefully noting the manner in\r\nwhich a lame leg is performing its functions, and closely scrutinizing\r\nthe motions of the whole extremity, and especially of the various joints\r\nwhich enter into its structure; by minutely examining every part of the\r\nlimb; by observing the outlines; by testing the change, if any, in\r\ntemperature and the state of the sensibility--all these investigations\r\nmay guide the surgeon to a correct localization of the seat of trouble,\r\nbut he must carefully refrain from the adoption of a hasty conclusion,\r\nand, above all, assure himself that he has not failed to make the foot,\r\nof all the organs of the horse the most liable to injury and lesion, the\r\nsubject of the most thorough and minute examination of all the parts\r\nwhich compose the suffering extremity.\r\n\r\nThe greater liability of the foot than of any other part of the\r\nextremities to injury from casualties, natural to its situation and use,\r\nshould always suggest the beginning of an inquiry, especially in an\r\nobscure case of lameness at that point. Indeed the lameness may have an\r\napparent location elsewhere when that is the true seat of the trouble,\r\nand the surgeon who, while examining his lame patient, discovers a\r\nringbone, and convincing himself that he has encountered the cause of\r\nthe disordered action suspends his investigation without subjecting the\r\nfoot to a close scrutiny, at a later day when regrets will avail\r\nnothing, may deeply regret his neglect and inadvertence. As in human\r\npathological experience, however, there are instances when inscrutable\r\ndiseases will deliver their fatal messages, while leaving no mark and\r\nmaking no sign by which they might be identified and classified, so it\r\nwill happen that in the humbler animals the onset and progress of\r\nmysterious and unrecognizable ailments will at times baffle the most\r\nskilled veterinarian, and leave our burden-bearing servants to succumb\r\nto the inevitable, and suffer and perish in unrelieved distress.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF BONES.\r\n\r\nPERIOSTITIS, OSTITIS, AND EXOSTOSIS.\r\n\r\nFrom the closeness and intimacy of the connection existing between the\r\ntwo principal elements of the bony structure while in health, it\r\nfrequently becomes exceedingly difficult, when a state of disease has\r\nsupervened, to discriminate accurately as to the part primarily affected\r\nand to determine positively whether the periosteum or the body of the\r\nbone is originally implicated. Yet a knowledge of the fact is often of\r\nthe first importance, in order to obtain a favorable result from the\r\ntreatment to be instituted. It is, however, quite evident that in a\r\nmajority of instances the bony growths which so frequently appear on the\r\nsurface of their structure, to which the general term of exostosis is\r\napplied, have had their origin in an inflammation of the periosteum, or\r\nenveloping membrane, and known as periostitis. However this may be, we\r\nhave as a frequent result, sometimes on the body of the bone, sometimes\r\nat the extremities, and sometimes involving the articulation itself,\r\ncertain bony growths, or exostoses, known otherwise by the term of\r\nsplint, ringbone, and spavin, all of which, in an important sense, may\r\nbe finally referred to the periosteum as their nutrient source and\r\nsupport, at least after their formation, if not for their incipient\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--It is certain that inflammation of the periosteum is\r\nfrequently referable to wounds and bruises caused by external agencies,\r\nand it is also true that it may possibly result from the spreading\r\ninflammation of surrounding diseased tissues, but in any case the result\r\nis uniformly seen in the deposit of a bony growth, more or less diffuse,\r\nsometimes of irregular outline, and at others projecting distinctly from\r\nthe surface from which it springs, as so commonly presented in the\r\nringbone and the spavin.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--This condition of periostitis is often difficult to\r\ndetermine. The signs of inflammation are so obscure, the swelling of the\r\nparts so insignificant, any increase of heat so imperceptible, and the\r\nsoreness so slight, that even the most acute observer may fail to find\r\nthe point of its existence, and it is often long after the discovery of\r\nthe disease itself that its location is positively revealed by the\r\nvisible presence of the exostosis. Yet the first question had been\r\nresolved, in discovering the fact of the lameness, while the second and\r\nthird remained unanswered, and the identification of the affected limb\r\nand the point of origin of the trouble remained unknown until their\r\npalpable revelation to the senses.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--When, by careful scrutiny, the ailment has been located, a\r\nresort to treatment must be had at once, in order to prevent, if\r\npossible, any further deposit of the calcareous structure and increase\r\nof the exostotic growth. With this view the application of water, either\r\nwarm or cold, rendered astringent by the addition of alum or sugar of\r\nlead, will be beneficial. The tendency to the formation of the bony\r\ngrowth, and the increase of its development after its actual formation,\r\nmay often be checked by the application of a severe blister of Spanish\r\nfly. The failure of these means and the establishment of the diseased\r\nprocess in the form of chronic periostitis cause various changes in the\r\nbone covered by the disordered membrane, and the result may be\r\nsoftening, degeneration, or necrosis, but more usually it is followed by\r\nthe formation of the bony growths referred to, on the cannon bone, the\r\ncoronet, the hock, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPLINTS.\r\n\r\nWe first turn our attention to the splint, as certain bony enlargements\r\nthat are developed on the cannon bone, between the knee or the hock and\r\nthe fetlock joint, are called. (See Plate XXV.) They are found on the\r\ninside of the leg, from the knee, near which they are frequently found,\r\ndownward to about the lower third of the principal cannon bone. They are\r\nof various dimensions, and are readily perceptible both to the eye and\r\nto the touch. They vary considerably in size, ranging from that of a\r\nlarge nut downward to very small proportions. In searching for them they\r\nmay be readily detected by the hand if they have attained sufficient\r\ndevelopment in their usual situation, but must be distinguished from a\r\nsmall, bony enlargement that may be felt at the lower third of the\r\ncannon bone, which is neither a splint nor a pathological formation of\r\nany kind, but merely the buttonlike enlargement at the lower extremity\r\nof the small metacarpal or splint bone.\r\n\r\nWe have said that splints are to be found on the inside of the leg. This\r\nis true as a general statement, but it is not invariably so, for they\r\noccasionally appear on the outside. It is also true that they appear\r\nmost commonly on the fore legs, but this is not exclusively the case,\r\nbecause they may at times be found on both the inside and outside of the\r\nhind leg. Usually a splint forms only a true exostosis, or a single bony\r\ngrowth, with a somewhat diffuse base, but neither is this invariably the\r\ncase. In some instances they assume more important dimensions, and pass\r\nfrom the inside to the outside of the bone, on its posterior face,\r\nbetween that and the suspensory ligament. This form is termed the pegged\r\nsplint, and constitutes a serious and permanent deformity, in\r\nconsequence of its interference with the play of the fibrous cord which\r\npasses behind it, becoming thus a source of continual irritation and\r\nconsequently of permanent lameness.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--A splint may thus frequently become a cause of lameness\r\nthough not necessarily in every instance, but it is a lameness\r\npossessing features peculiar to itself. It is not always continuous, but\r\nat times assumes an intermittent character, and is more marked when the\r\nanimal is warm than when cool. If the lameness is near the knee joint,\r\nit is very liable to become aggravated when the animal is put to work,\r\nand the gait acquires then a peculiar character, arising from the manner\r\nin which the limb is carried outward from the knees downward, which is\r\ndone by a kind of abduction of the lower part of the leg. Other\r\nsymptoms, however, than the lameness and the presence of the splint,\r\nwhich is its cause, may be looked for in the same connection as those\r\nwhich have been mentioned as pertaining to certain evidences of\r\nperiostitis, in the increase of the temperature of the part, with\r\nswelling and probably pain on pressure. This last symptom is of no\r\nlittle importance, since its presence or absence has in many cases\r\nformed the determining point in deciding a question of difficult\r\ndiagnosis.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--A splint being one of the results of periostitis, and the\r\nlatter one of the effects of external hurts, it naturally follows that\r\nthe parts which are most exposed to blows and collisions will be those\r\non which the splint will most commonly be found, and it may not be\r\nimproper, therefore, to refer to hurts from without as among the common\r\ncauses of the lesion. But other causes may also be productive of the\r\nevil, and among these may be mentioned the over-straining of an immature\r\norganism by the imposition of excessive labor upon a young animal at a\r\ntoo early period of his life. The bones which enter into the formation\r\nof the cannon are three in number, one large and two smaller, which,\r\nduring the youth of the animal, are more or less articulated, with a\r\nlimited amount of mobility, but which become in maturity firmly joined\r\nby a rigid union and ossification of their interarticular surface. If\r\nthe immature animal is compelled, then, to perform exacting tasks beyond\r\nhis strength, the inevitable result will follow in the muscular\r\nstraining, and perhaps tearing asunder of the fibers which unite the\r\nbones at their points of juncture, and it is difficult to understand how\r\ninflammation or periostitis can fail to develop as the natural\r\nconsequence of such local irritation. If the result were deliberately\r\nand intelligently designed, it could hardly be more effectually\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nThe splint is an object of the commonest occurrence--so common, indeed,\r\nthat in large cities a horse which can not exhibit one or more specimens\r\nupon some portion of his extremities is one of the rarest of spectacles.\r\nThough it is in some instances a cause of lameness, and its discovery\r\nand cure are sometimes beyond the ability of the shrewdest and most\r\nexperienced veterinarians, yet as a source of vital danger to the\r\ngeneral equine organization, or even of functional disturbance, or of\r\npractical inconvenience, aside from the rare exceptional cases which\r\nexist as mere samples of possibility, it can not be considered to belong\r\nto the category of serious lesions. The worst stigma that attaches to it\r\nis that in general estimation it is ranked among eyesores and continues\r\nindefinitely to be that and nothing different. The inflammation in which\r\nthey originated, acute at first, either subsides or assumes the chronic\r\nform, and the bony growth becomes a permanence--more or less\r\nestablished, it is true, but doing no positive harm and not hindering\r\nthe animal from continuing his daily routine of labor. All this,\r\nhowever, requires a proviso against the occurrence of a subsequent acute\r\nattack, when, as with other exostoses, a fresh access of acute symptoms\r\nmay be followed by a new pathological activity, which shall again\r\ndevelop, as a natural result, a reappearance of the lameness.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--It is, of course, the consideration of the comparative\r\nharmlessness of splints that suggests and justifies the policy of\r\nnoninterference, except as they become a positive cause of lameness. And\r\na more positive argument for such noninterference consists in the fact\r\nthat any active and irritating treatment may so excite the parts as to\r\nbring about a renewed pathological activity, which may result in a\r\nreduplication of the phenomena, with a second edition, if not a second\r\nand enlarged volume, of the whole story. For our part, our faith is firm\r\nin the impolicy of interference, and this faith is founded on an\r\nexperience of many years, during which our practice has been that of\r\nabstention.\r\n\r\nOf course, there will be exceptional conditions which will at times\r\nindicate a different course. These will become evident when the\r\noccasions present themselves, and extraordinary forms and effects of\r\ninflammation and growth in the tumors offer special indications. But our\r\nconviction remains unshaken that surgical treatment of the operative\r\nkind is usually useless, if not dangerous. We have little faith in the\r\nmethod of extirpation except under very special conditions, among which\r\nthat of diminutive size has been named; this seems in itself to\r\nconstitute a sufficient negative argument. Even in such a case a resort\r\nto the knife or the gouge could scarcely find a justification, since no\r\noperative procedure is ever without a degree of hazard, to say nothing\r\nof the considerations which are always forcibly negative in any question\r\nof the infliction of pain and the unnecessary use of the knife.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXV.\r\n\r\nSPLINT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVI.\r\n\r\nSOUND FOOT.\r\n\r\nRINGBONE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVII.\r\n\r\nVARIOUS TYPES OF SPAVIN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVIII.\r\n\r\nBONE SPAVIN. HOCKS, WITH SKIN REMOVED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIX.\r\n\r\nBONE SPAVIN.]\r\n\r\nIf an acute periostitis of the cannon bone has been readily discovered,\r\nthe treatment we have already suggested for that ailment is at once\r\nindicated, and the astringent lotions may be relied upon to bring about\r\nbeneficial results. Sometimes, however, preference may be given to a\r\nlotion possessing a somewhat different quality, the alterative\r\nconsisting of tincture of iodin applied to the inflamed spot several\r\ntimes daily. If the lameness persists under this mild course of\r\ntreatment, it must, of course, be attacked by other methods, and we must\r\nresort to the cantharides ointment or Spanish-fly blister, as we have\r\nbefore recommended. Besides this, and producing an analogous effect, the\r\ncompounds of biniodid of mercury are favored by some. It is prepared in\r\nthe form of an ointment, consisting of 1 dram of the biniodid to 1 ounce\r\nof either lard or vaseline. It forms an excellent blistering and\r\nalterative application, and is of special advantage in newly formed or\r\nrecently discovered exostosis.\r\n\r\nIt remains a pertinent query, however, and one which seems to be easily\r\nanswered, whether a tumor so diminutive in size that it can be detected\r\nonly by diligent search, and which is neither a disfigurement nor an\r\nobstruction to the motion of the limb, need receive any recognition\r\nwhatever. Other modes of treatment for splints are recommended and\r\npracticed which belong strictly to the domain of operative veterinary\r\nsurgery; among these are to be reckoned actual cauterization, or the\r\napplication of the fire iron and the operation of periosteotomy. These\r\nare frequently indicated in the treatment of splints which have resisted\r\nmilder means.\r\n\r\nThe mode of the development of their growth; their intimacy, greater or\r\nless, with both the large and the small cannon bones; the possibility of\r\ntheir extending to the back of these bones under the suspensory\r\nligament; the dangerous complications which may follow the rough\r\nhandling of the parts, with also a possibility, and, indeed, a\r\nprobability, of their return after removal--these are the considerations\r\nwhich have influenced our judgment in discarding from our practice and\r\nour approval the method of removal by the saw or the chisel, as\r\nrecommended by certain European veterinarians.\r\n\r\n\r\nRINGBONES.\r\n\r\nRingbone is the designation of the exostosis which is found on the\r\ncoronet and in the digital and phalangeal regions. (See Plate XXVI.) The\r\nname is appropriate, because the growth extends quite around the\r\ncoronet, which it encircles in the manner of a ring, or perhaps because\r\nit often forms upon the back of that bone a regular osseous arch,\r\nthrough which the back tendons obtain a passage. The places where these\r\ngrowths are usually developed have caused their subdivision and\r\nclassification into three varieties, with the designations of high,\r\nmiddle, and low, though much can be said as to the importance of the\r\ndistinction. It is true that the ringbone or phalangeal exostosis may be\r\nfound at various points on the foot, in one case forming a large bunch\r\non the upper part and quite close to the fetlock joint; in another\r\naround the upper border of the hoof, or perhaps on the extreme front or\r\non the very back of the coronet. The shape in which they commonly appear\r\nis favorable to their easy discovery, their form when near the fetlock\r\nusually varying too much from the natural outlines of the part when\r\ncompared with those of the opposite side to admit of error in the\r\nmatter. (See also page 439.)\r\n\r\nA ringbone, when on the front of the foot, even when not very largely\r\ndeveloped, assumes the form of a diffused convex swelling. If situated\r\non the lower part, it will form a thick ring, encircling that portion of\r\nthe foot immediately above the hoof; when found on the posterior part, a\r\nsmall, sharp osseous growth somewhat projecting, sometimes on the inside\r\nand sometimes on the outside of the coronet, may comprise the entire\r\nmanifestation.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--As with splints, ringbones may result from severe labor in\r\nearly life, before the process of ossification has been fully perfected;\r\nor they may be referred to bruises, blows, sprains, or other violence;\r\ninjuries of tendons, ligaments, or joints also may be among the\r\naccountable causes.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that they may commonly be traced to diseases and traumatic\r\nlesions of the foot, and their appearance may be reasonably expected\r\namong the sequelae of an abscess of the coronet; or the cause may be a\r\nsevere contusion resulting from calking, or a deep-punctured wound from\r\npicking up a nail or stepping upon any hard object of sufficiently\r\nirregular form to penetrate the sole.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a ringbone may originate in heredity. This is a fact of no\r\nlittle importance in its relation to questions connected with the\r\nextensive interests of the stock breeder and purchaser.\r\n\r\nThat the hereditary transmission of constitutional idiosyncrasies is an\r\nactive cause with regard to diseases in general, it would be absurd to\r\nassert, but we do say that a predisposition to contract ringbone through\r\nfaulty conformation, such as long, thin pasterns with narrow joints and\r\nsteep fetlocks, may be inherited in many cases, and in a smaller\r\nproportion of cases this predisposition may act as a secondary cause in\r\nthe formation of ringbone.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this point when considered in reference to the policy\r\nwhich should be observed in the selection of breeding stock is obvious,\r\nand, as the whole matter is within the control of the owners and\r\nbreeders, it will be their own fault if the unchecked transmission of\r\nringbones from one equine generation to another is allowed to continue.\r\nIt is our belief that among the diseases which are known for their\r\ntendency to perpetuate and repeat themselves by individual succession,\r\nthose of the bony structures stand first, and the inference from such\r\nfact which would exclude every animal of doubtful soundness in its\r\nosseous apparatus from the stud list and the brood farm is too plain for\r\nargument.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Periostitis of the phalanges is an ailment requiring\r\ncareful exploration and minute inspection for its discovery, and is very\r\nliable to result in a ringbone of which lameness is the result. The\r\nmode of its manifestation varies according to the state of development\r\nof the diseased growth as affected by the circumstances of its location\r\nand dimensions. It is commonly of the kind which, in consequence of its\r\nintermittent character, is termed lameness when cool, having the\r\npeculiarity of exhibiting itself when the animal starts from the stable\r\nand of diminishing, if not entirely disappearing after some distance of\r\ntravel, to return to its original degree, if not indeed a severer one,\r\nwhen he has again cooled off in his stable. The size of the ringbone\r\ndoes not indicate the degree to which it cripples the patient, but the\r\nposition may, especially when it interferes with the free movement of\r\nthe tendons which pass behind and in front of the foot. While a large\r\nringbone will often interfere but little with the motion of the limb, a\r\nsmaller growth, if situated under the tendon, may become the cause of\r\nconsiderable and continued pain.\r\n\r\nA ringbone is doubtless a worse evil than a splint. Its growth, its\r\nlocation, its tendency to increased development, its exposure to the\r\ninfluence of causes of renewed danger, all tend to impart an unfavorable\r\ncast to the prognosis of a case and to emphasize the importance and the\r\nvalue of an early discovery of its presence and possible growth. Even\r\nwhen the discovery has been made, it is often the case that the truth\r\nhas come to light too late for effectual treatment. Months may have\r\nelapsed after the first manifestation of the lameness before a discovery\r\nhas been made of the lesion from which it has originated, and there is\r\nno recall for the lapsed time. And by the uncompromising seriousness of\r\nthe discouraging prognosis must the energy and severity of the treatment\r\nand the promptness of its administration be measured. The periostitis\r\nhas been overlooked; any chance that might have existed for preventing\r\nits advance to the chronic stage has been lost; the osseous formation is\r\nestablished; the ringbone is a fixed fact, and the indications are\r\nurgent and pressing.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The preventive treatment consists in keeping colts well\r\nnourished and in trimming the hoof and shoeing to balance the foot\r\nproperly and thus prevent an abnormal strain on the ligaments. Even\r\nafter the ringbone has developed, a cure may sometimes be occasioned by\r\nproper shoeing directed toward straightening the axis of the foot as\r\nviewed from the side by making the wall of the hoof from the coronet to\r\nthe toe continuous with the line formed by the front of the pastern. So\r\nlong as inflammation of the periosteum and ligaments remains, a sharp\r\nblister of biniodid of mercury and cantharides may do good if the animal\r\nis allowed to rest for four or five weeks. If this fails, some success\r\nmay be accomplished by point firing in two or three lines over the\r\nringbone. It is necessary to touch the hot iron well into the bone, as\r\nsuperficial firing does little good. When all these measures have failed\r\nto remove the lameness, or when the animal is not worth a long and\r\nuncertain treatment, a competent veterinarian should be engaged to\r\nperform double neurectomy, high or low, of the plantar nerves, or\r\nneurectomy of the median nerve as indicated by the seat of the lesion.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIDEBONES.\r\n\r\nOn each side of the bone of the hoof--the coffinbone--there are normally\r\ntwo supplementary organs which are called the cartilages of the foot.\r\nThey are soft, and though in a degree elastic, yet somewhat resisting,\r\nand are implanted on the lateral wings of the coffinbone. Evidently\r\ntheir office is to assist in the elastic expansion and contraction of\r\nthe posterior part of the hoof, and their healthy and normal action\r\ndoubtless contributes in an important degree to the perfect performance\r\nof the functions of that part of the leg. These organs are, however,\r\nliable to undergo a process of disease which results in an entire change\r\nin their properties, if not in their shape, by which they acquire a\r\ncharacter of hardness resulting from the deposit of earthy substance in\r\nthe intimate structure of the cartilage, and it is this change, when its\r\nconsummation has been effected, that brings to our cognizance the\r\ndiseased growth which has received the designation of sidebones. They\r\nare situated on one or both sides of the leg, bulging above the superior\r\nborder of the hoof in the form of two hard bodies composed of ossified\r\ncartilage, irregularly square in shape and unyielding under the pressure\r\nof the fingers.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--Sidebones may be the result of a low inflammatory condition or\r\nof an acute attack as well, or may be caused by sprains, bruises, or\r\nblows; or they may have their rise in certain diseases affecting the\r\nfoot proper, such as corns, quarter cracks, or quittor. The deposit of\r\ncalcareous matter in the cartilage is not always uniform, the base of\r\nthat organ near its line of union with the coffinbone being in some\r\ncases its limit, while at other times it is diffused throughout its\r\nsubstance, the size and prominence of the growth varying much in\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--It would naturally be inferred that the degree of\r\ninterference with the proper functions of the hoof which must result\r\nfrom such a pathological change would be proportioned to the size of the\r\ntumor, and that as the dimensions increase the resulting lameness would\r\nbe the greater in degree. This, however, is not the fact. A small tumor\r\nwhile in a condition of acute inflammation during the formative stage\r\nmay cripple a patient more severely than a much larger one in a later\r\nstage of the disease. In any case the lameness is never wanting, and\r\nwith its intermittent character may usually be detected when the animal\r\nis cooled off after labor or exercise. The class of animals in which\r\nthis feature of the disease is most frequently seen is that of the\r\nheavy draft horse and others similarly employed. There is a wide margin\r\nof difference in respect to the degrees of severity which may\r\ncharacterize different cases of sidebone. While one may be so slight as\r\nto cause no inconvenience, another may develop elements of danger which\r\nmay involve the necessity of severe surgical interference.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The curative treatment should be similar to the\r\nprophylactic, and such means should be used as would tend to prevent the\r\ndeposit of bony matters by checking the acute inflammation which causes\r\nit. The means recommended are the free use of the cold bath; frequent\r\nsoaking of the feet, and at a later period treatment with iodin, either\r\nby painting the surface with the tincture several times daily or by\r\napplying an ointment made by mixing 1 dram of the crystals with 2 ounces\r\nof vaseline, rubbed in once a day for several days. If this proves to be\r\nineffective, a Spanish-fly blister to which a few grains of biniodid of\r\nmercury have been added will effect in a majority of cases the desired\r\nresult and remove the lameness. If finally this treatment is ineffectual\r\nthe case must be relegated to the surgeon for the operation of\r\nneurectomy, or the free and deep application of the firing iron.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPAVIN.\r\n\r\n(Pls. XXVII-XXIX.)\r\n\r\nThis affection, popularly termed bone spavin, is an exostosis of the\r\nhock joint. The general impression is that in a spavined hock the bony\r\ngrowth should be seated on the anterior and internal part of the joint,\r\nand this is partially correct, as such a growth will constitute a spavin\r\nin the most nearly correct sense of the term. But an enlargement may\r\nappear on the upper part of the hock also, or possibly a little below\r\nthe inner side of the lower extremity of the shank bone, forming what is\r\nknown as a high spavin; or, again, the growth may form just on the\r\noutside of the hock and become an outside or external spavin. And,\r\nfinally, the entire under surface may become the seat of the osseous\r\ndeposit, and involve the articular face of all the bones of the hock,\r\nwhich again is a bone spavin. There would seem, then, to be but little\r\ndifficulty in comprehending the nature of a bone spavin, and there would\r\nbe none but for the fact that there are similar affections which may\r\nconfuse one if the diagnosis is not very carefully made.\r\n\r\nBut the hock may be \"spavined,\" while to all outward observation it\r\nstill retains its perfect form. With no enlargement perceptible to sight\r\nor touch the animal may yet be disabled by an occult spavin, an\r\nanchylosis in fact, which has resulted from a union of several of the\r\nbones of the joint, and it is only those who are able to realize the\r\nimportance of its action to the perfect fulfillment of the function of\r\nlocomotion by the hind leg who can comprehend the gravity of the only\r\nprognosis which can be justified by the facts of the case--a prognosis\r\nwhich is essentially a sentence of serious import in respect to the\r\nfuture usefulness and value of the animal. For no disease, if we except\r\nthose acute inflammatory attacks upon vital organs to which the patient\r\nsuccumbs at once, is more destructive to the usefulness and value of a\r\nhorse than a confirmed spavin. Serious in its inception, serious in its\r\nprogress, it is an ailment which, when once established, becomes a fixed\r\ncondition which there is no known means of dislodging.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--The periostitis, of which it is nearly always a termination,\r\nis usually the effect of a traumatic cause operating upon the\r\ncomplicated structure of the hock, such as a sprain which has torn a\r\nligamentous insertion and lacerated some of its fibers, or a violent\r\neffort in jumping, galloping, or trotting, to which the victim has been\r\ncompelled by the torture of whip and spur while in use as a gambling\r\nimplement by a sporting owner, under the pretext of \"improving his\r\nbreed\"; the extra exertion of starting an inordinately heavy load, or an\r\neffort to recover his balance from a misstep, slipping upon an icy\r\nsurface, or sliding with worn shoes upon a bad pavement, and other\r\nkindred causes. We can repeat here what we have before said concerning\r\nbones, in respect to heredity as a cause. From our own experience we\r\nknow of equine families in which this condition has been transmitted\r\nfrom generation to generation, and animals otherwise of excellent\r\nconformation have been rendered valueless by the misfortune of a\r\ncongenital spavin.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The evil is one of the most serious character for other\r\nreasons, among which may be specified the slowness of its development\r\nand the insidiousness of its growth. Certain indefinite phenomena and\r\nalarming changes and incidents furnish usually the only portents of\r\napproaching trouble. Among these signs may be mentioned a peculiar\r\nposture assumed by the patient while at rest, and becoming at length so\r\nhabitual that it can not fail to suggest the action of some hidden\r\ndisorder. The posture is due to the action of the adductor muscles, the\r\nlower part of the leg being carried inward, and the heel of the shoe\r\nresting on the toe of the opposite foot. Then an unwillingness may be\r\nnoticed in the animal to move from one side of the stall to the other.\r\nWhen driven he will travel, but stiffly, with a sort of sidelong gait\r\nbetween the shafts, and after finishing his task and resting again in\r\nhis stall will pose with the toe pointing forward, the heel raised, and\r\nthe hock flexed. Considerable heat and inflammation soon appear. The\r\nslight lameness which appears when backing out of the stall ceases to be\r\nnoticeable after a short distance of travel.\r\n\r\nA minute examination of the hock may then reveal the existence of a bony\r\nenlargement which may be detected just at the junction of the hock and\r\nthe cannon bone, on the inside and a little in front, and tangible both\r\nto sight and touch. This enlargement, or bone spavin, grows rapidly and\r\npersistently and soon acquires dimensions which renders it impossible to\r\ndoubt any longer its existence or its nature. Once established, its\r\ndevelopment continues under conditions of progress similar to those to\r\nwhich we have before alluded in speaking of other like affections. The\r\nargument advanced by some that because these bony deposits are\r\nfrequently found on both hocks they are not spavins is fallacious. If\r\nthey are discovered on both hocks, it proves merely that they are not\r\nconfined to a single joint.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic lameness of bone spavin, as it affects the motion of\r\nthe hock joint, presents two aspects. In one class of cases it is most\r\npronounced when the horse is cool, in the other when he is at work. The\r\nfirst is characterized by the fact that when the animal travels the toe\r\nfirst touches the ground, and the heel descends more slowly, the motion\r\nof flexion at the hock taking place stiffly, and accompanied with a\r\ndropping of the hip on the opposite side. In the other case the\r\npeculiarity is that the lameness increases as the horse travels; that\r\nwhen he stops he seeks to favor the lame leg, and when he resumes his\r\nwork soon after he steps much on his toe, as in the first variety.\r\n\r\nAs with sidebones, though for a somewhat different reason, the\r\ndimensions of the spavin and the degree of the lameness do not seem to\r\nbear any determinate relation, the most pronounced symptoms at times\r\naccompanying a very diminutive growth. The distinction between the two\r\nvarieties of cool and warm, however, may easily be determined by\r\nremembering the fact that in most cases the first, or cool, is due to a\r\nsimple exostosis, while the second is generally connected with disease\r\nof the articulation, such as ulceration of the articular surface--a\r\ncondition which, as we proceed further, will receive our attention when\r\nwe reach the subject of stringhalt.\r\n\r\nAn excellent test for spavin lameness, which may be readily applied,\r\nconsists in lifting the affected leg from the ground for one or two\r\nminutes and holding the foot high so as to flex all the joints. An\r\nassistant, with the halter strap in his hand, quickly starts the animal\r\noff in a trot, when, if the hock joint is affected, the lameness will be\r\nso greatly intensified as to lead readily to a diagnosis.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis._--Having thus fully considered the history of bone spavin,\r\nwe are prepared to give due weight to the reasons that exist for the\r\nadverse prognosis which we must usually feel compelled to pronounce when\r\nencountering it in practice, as well as to realize the importance of\r\nearly discovery. It is but seldom, however, that the necessary advantage\r\nof this early knowledge can be obtained, and when the true nature of\r\nthe trouble has become apparent it is usually too late to resort to the\r\nremedial measures which, if duly forewarned, a skillful practitioner\r\nmight have employed. We are fully persuaded that but for the loss of the\r\ntime wasted in the treatment of purely imaginary ailments very many\r\ncases of bone spavin might be arrested in their incipiency and their\r\nvictims preserved for years of comfort for themselves and valuable labor\r\nto their owners.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--To consider a hypothetical case: An early discovery of\r\nlameness has been made; that is, the existence of an acute\r\ninflammation--of periostitis--has been detected. The increased\r\ntemperature of the parts has been observed, with the stiffened gait and\r\nthe characteristic pose of the limb, and the question is proposed for\r\nsolution, What is to be done? Even with only these comparatively\r\ndoubtful symptoms--doubtful with the nonexpert--we should direct our\r\ntreatment to the hock in preference to any other joint, since of all the\r\njoints of the hind leg it is this which is most liable to be attacked, a\r\nnatural result from its peculiarities of structure and function. And in\r\nanswer to the query, What is the first treatment indicated? We should\r\nanswer _rest_--emphatically, and as an essential condition, _rest_.\r\nWhether only threatened, suspected, or positively diseased, the animal\r\nmust be wholly released from labor, and it must be no partial or\r\ntemporary quiet of a few days. In all stages and conditions of the\r\ndisease, whether the spavin is nothing more than a simple exostosis, or\r\nwhether accompanied with the complication of arthritis, there must be a\r\ntotal suspension of effort until the danger is over. Less than a month's\r\nquiet ought not to be thought of--the longer the better.\r\n\r\nGood results may also be expected from local applications. The various\r\nlotions which cool the parts, the astringents which lower the tension of\r\nthe blood vessels, the tepid fomentations which accelerate the\r\ncirculation in the engorged capillaries, the liniments of various\r\ncomposition, the stimulants, the opiate anodynes, the sedative\r\npreparations of aconite, the alterative frictions of iodin--all these\r\nare recommended and prescribed by one or another. We prefer\r\ncounterirritants, for the reason, among many others, that by the\r\npromptness of their action they tend to prevent the formation of the\r\nbony deposits. The lameness will often yield to the blistering action of\r\ncantharides, in the form of ointment or liniment, and to the alterative\r\npreparations of iodin or mercury. If the owner of a \"spavined\" horse\r\nreally succeeds in removing the lameness, he has accomplished all that\r\nhe is justified in hoping for; beyond this let him be well persuaded\r\nthat a \"cure\" is impossible.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, moreover, he will do well to be on his guard against\r\nthe patented \"cures\" which the traveling horse doctor may urge upon him,\r\nand withhold his faith from the circular of the agent who will deluge\r\nhim with references and certificates. It is possible that nostrums may\r\nin some exceptional instances prove serviceable, but the greater number\r\nof them are capable of producing only injurious effects. The removal of\r\nthe bony tumor can not be accomplished by any such means, and if a trial\r\nof these unknown compounds should be followed by complications no worse\r\nthan the establishment of one or more ugly, hairless cicatrices, it will\r\nbe well for both the horse and his owner.\r\n\r\nRest and counterirritation, with the proper medicaments, constitute,\r\nthen, the prominent points in the treatment designed for the relief of\r\nbone spavin. Yet there are cases in which all the agencies and methods\r\nreferred to seem to lack effectiveness and fail to produce satisfactory\r\nresults. Either the rest has been prematurely interrupted or the\r\nblisters have failed to modify the serous infiltration, or the case in\r\nhand has some undiscernible characteristics which seem to have rendered\r\nthe disease neutral to the agencies used against it. An indication of\r\nmore energetic means is then presented, and free cauterization with the\r\nfiring iron becomes necessary.\r\n\r\nAt this point a word of explanation in reference to this operation of\r\nfiring may be appropriate for the satisfaction of any among our readers\r\nwho may entertain an exaggerated idea of its severity and possible\r\ncruelty.\r\n\r\nThe operation is one of simplicity, but is nevertheless one which, in\r\norder to secure its benefits, must be reserved for times and occasions\r\nof which only the best knowledge and highest discretion should be\r\nallowed to judge. It is not the mere application of a hot iron to a\r\ngiven part of the body which constitutes the operation of firing. It is\r\nthe methodical and scientific introduction of heat into the structure\r\nwith a view to a given effect upon a diseased organ or tissue by an\r\nexpert surgeon. The first is one of the degrees of mere burning. The\r\nother is scientific cauterization, and is a surgical manipulation which\r\nshould be committed exclusively to the practiced hand of the veterinary\r\nsurgeon.\r\n\r\nEither firing alone or stimulation with blisters is of great efficacy\r\nfor the relief of lameness from bone spavin. Failure to produce relief\r\nafter a few applications and after allowing a sufficient interval of\r\nrest should be followed by a second or, if needed, a third firing.\r\n\r\nIn case of further failure there is a reserve of certain special\r\noperations which have been tried and recommended, among which those of\r\ncunean tenotomy, periosteotomy, the division of nervous branches, etc.,\r\nmay be mentioned. These, however, belong to the peculiar domain of the\r\nveterinary practitioner, and need not now engage our attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURES.\r\n\r\nIn technical language a fracture is a \"solution of continuity in the\r\nstructure or substance of a bone.\" It ranks among the most serious of\r\nthe lesions to which the horse--or any animal--can be subject. It is a\r\nsubject of special interest to veterinarians and horse owners in view of\r\nthe fact that it occurs in such a variety of forms and subjects the\r\npatient to much loss of time, resulting in the suspension of his earning\r\ncapacity. Though of less serious consequence in the horse than in man,\r\nit is always a matter of grave import. It is always slow and tedious in\r\nhealing and is frequently of doubtful and unsatisfactory result.\r\n\r\nThis solution of continuity may take place in two principal ways. In the\r\nmost numerous instances it includes the total thickness of the bone and\r\nis a complete fracture. In other cases it involves only a portion of the\r\nthickness of the bone, and for that reason is described as incomplete.\r\nIf the bone is divided into two separate portions and the soft parts\r\nhave received no injury, the fracture is a simple one, or it becomes\r\ncompound if the soft parts have suffered laceration, and comminuted if\r\nthe bones have been crushed or ground into fragments, many or few. The\r\ndirection of the break also determines its further classification.\r\nBroken at a right angle, it is transverse; at a different angle it\r\nbecomes oblique, and it may be longitudinal or lengthwise. In a complete\r\nfracture, especially of the oblique kind, there is a condition of great\r\nimportance in respect to its effect upon the ultimate result of the\r\ntreatment in the fact that from various causes, such as muscular\r\ncontractions or excessive motion, the bony fragments do not maintain\r\ntheir mutual coaptation, but become separated at the ends, which makes\r\nit necessary to add another descriptive term--with displacement. These\r\nwords again suggest the negative and introduce the term without\r\ndisplacement, when the facts justify that description. Furthermore, a\r\nfracture may be intra-articular or extra-articular, as it extends into a\r\njoint or otherwise, and, once more, intra-periosteal when the periosteum\r\nremains intact. Finally, there is no absolute limit to the use of\r\ndescriptive terminology in the case.\r\n\r\nThe condition of displacement is largely influential in determining the\r\nquestion of treatment and as affecting the final result of a case of\r\nfracture. This, however, is dependent upon its location or whether its\r\nseat is in one or more of the axes of the bone, in its length, its\r\nbreadth, its thickness, or its circumference. An incomplete fracture may\r\nalso be either simple or comminuted. In the latter case the fragments\r\nare held together by the periosteum when it is intact; in that case the\r\nfracture belongs to the intra-periosteal class. At times, also, there is\r\nonly a simple fissure or split in the bone, making a condition of much\r\ndifficulty of diagnosis.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Two varieties of originating cause may be recognized in cases\r\nof fracture. They are the predisposing and the occasional. As to the\r\nfirst, different species of animals differ in the degree of their\r\nliability. That of the dog is greater than that of the horse, and in\r\nhorses the various questions of age, the mode of labor, the season of\r\nthe year, the portion of the body most exposed, and the existence of\r\nailments, local and general, are all to be taken into account.\r\n\r\nAmong horses, those employed in heavy draft work or that are driven over\r\nbad roads are more exposed than light-draft or saddle horses, and\r\nanimals of different ages are not equally liable. Dogs and young horses,\r\nwith those which have become sufficiently aged for their bones to have\r\nacquired an enhanced degree of frangibility, are more liable than those\r\nwhich have not exceeded the time of their prime. The season of the year\r\nis undoubtedly, though in an incidental way, an important factor in the\r\nproblem of the etiology of these accidents, for though they may be\r\nobserved at all times, it is during the months when the slippery\r\ncondition of the icy roads renders it difficult for both men and beasts\r\nto keep their feet that they occur most frequently. The long bones,\r\nthose especially which belong to the extremities, are most frequently\r\nthe seat of fractures, from the circumstance of their superficial\r\nposition, their exposure to contact and collision, and the violent\r\nmuscular efforts involved both in their constant, rapid movement and\r\ntheir labor in the shafts or at the pole of heavy and heavily laden\r\ncarriages.\r\n\r\nThe relation between sundry idiosyncrasies and diathesis and a liability\r\nto fractures is too constant and well-established a pathological fact to\r\nneed more than a passing reference. The history of rachitis, of\r\nmelanosis, and of osteoporosis, as related to an abnormal frangibility\r\nof the bones, is a part of our common medical knowledge. There are few\r\npersons who have not known of cases among their friends of frequent and\r\nalmost spontaneous fractures, or at least of such as seem to be produced\r\nby the slightest and most inadequate violence, and there is no tangible\r\nreason for doubting an analogous condition in dividuals of the equine\r\nrace. Among local predisposing causes mention must not be omitted of\r\nsuch bony diseases as caries, tuberculosis, and others of the same\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nExciting, occasional, or \"efficient\" causes of fracture are in most\r\ninstances external traumatisms, as violent contacts, collisions, falls,\r\netc., or sudden muscular contractions. These external accidents are\r\nvarious in their character, and are usually associated with quick\r\nmuscular exertion. A violent, ineffectual effort to move too heavy a\r\nload; a semispasmodic bracing of the frame to avoid a fall or resist a\r\npressure; a quick jump to escape a blow; stopping too suddenly after\r\nspeeding; struggling to liberate a foot from a rail, perhaps to be\r\nthrown in the effort--all these are familiar and easy examples of\r\naccidents happening hourly by which our equine servants become\r\nsufferers. We may add to these the fracture of the bones of the\r\nvertebrae, occurring when casting a patient for the purpose of undergoing\r\na surgical operation, quite as much as the result of muscular\r\ncontraction as of a preexisting diseased condition of the bones. A\r\nfracture occurring under these circumstances may be called with\r\npropriety indirect, while one which has resulted from a blow or a fall\r\ndifferently caused is of the direct kind.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--We now return to the first items in our classification of\r\nthe varieties of fractures for the purpose of bringing them in turn\r\nunder an orderly review, and our first examination will include those\r\nwhich belong to the first category, or the complete kind. Irregularity\r\nin the performance of the functions of the apparatus to which the\r\nfractured bone belongs is a necessary consequence of the existing\r\nlesion, and this is lameness. If the broken bone belongs to one of the\r\nextremities, the impossibility of the performance of its natural\r\nfunction in sustaining the weight of the body and contributing to the\r\nact of locomotion is usually complete, though the degree of disability\r\nwill vary according to the kind of fracture and the bone which is\r\ninjured. For example, a fracture of the cannon bone without\r\ndisplacement, or of one of the phalanges, which are surrounded and\r\nsustained by a complex fibrous structure, is, in a certain degree, not\r\nincompatible with some amount of resting on the foot. On the contrary,\r\nif the shank bone, or that of the forearm is the implicated member, it\r\nwould be very difficult for the leg to exercise any agency whatever in\r\nthe support of the body, and in a fracture of the lower jaw it would be\r\nobviously unreasonable to expect it to contribute materially to the\r\nmastication of feed.\r\n\r\nIt seldom happens that a fracture is not accompanied with a degree of\r\ndeformity, greater or less, of the region or the leg affected. This is\r\ndue to the exudation of the blood into the meshes of the surrounding\r\ntissues and to the displacement which occurs between the fragments of\r\nthe bones, with subsequently the swelling which follows the inflammation\r\nof the surrounding tissues. The character of the deformity will mainly\r\ndepend upon the manner in which the displacement occurs.\r\n\r\nIn a normal state of things the legs perform their movements with the\r\njoints as their only centers or bases of action, with no participation\r\nof intermediate points, while with a fracture the flexibility and motion\r\nwhich will be observed at unnatural points are among the most strongly\r\ncharacteristic signs of the lesion. No one need be told that, when the\r\nshaft of a limb is seen to bend midway between the joints, with the\r\nlower portion swinging freely, the leg is broken. There are still some\r\nconditions, however, in which the excessive mobility is not easy to\r\ndetect. Such are the cases in which the fracture exists in a short\r\nbone, near a movable joint, or in a bone of a region where several short\r\nand small bones are united in a group, or even in a long bone the\r\nsituation of which is such that the muscular covering prevents the\r\nvisible manifestation of the symptom.\r\n\r\nIf the situation of a fracture precludes its discovery by means of this\r\nabnormal flexibility, other modes of detection remain. There is one\r\nmethod which is absolute and positive and which can be applied in by far\r\nthe most, though not in all cases. This is crepitation, or the peculiar\r\neffect which is produced by the friction of the fractured surfaces one\r\nagainst another. Though discerned by the organs of hearing it can\r\nscarcely be called a sound, for the grating of the parts as the rubbing\r\ntakes place is more felt than heard; however, there is no mistaking its\r\nimport in cases favorable for the application of the test. The\r\nconditions in which it is not available are those of incomplete\r\nfracture, in which the mobility of the part is lacking, and those in\r\nwhich the whole array of phenomena are usually obscure. To obtain the\r\nbenefit of this pathognomonic sign requires deliberate, careful, and\r\ngentle manipulation. Sometimes the slightest of movements will be\r\nsufficient for its development, after much rougher handling has failed\r\nto discover it. Perhaps the failure in the latter case is due to a sort\r\nof defensive spasmodic rigidity caused by the pain resulting from the\r\nrude interference.\r\n\r\nMore or less reactive fever is a usual accompaniment of a fracture.\r\nEcchymosis in the parts is but a natural occurrence, and is more easily\r\ndiscovered in animals possessing a light-colored and delicate skin than\r\nin those of any other character.\r\n\r\nThere are difficulties in the way of the diagnosis of an incomplete\r\nfracture, even sometimes when there is a degree of impairment in the\r\nfunction of locomotion, with evidences of pain and swelling at the seat\r\nof lesion. There should then be a careful examination for evidences of a\r\nblow or other violence sufficient to account for the fracture, though\r\nvery often a suspicion of its existence can be converted into a\r\ncertainty only by a minute history of the patient if it can be obtained\r\nup to the moment of the occurrence of the injury. A diagnosis ought not\r\nto be hastily pronounced, and where good ground for suspicion exists it\r\nought not to be rejected upon any evidence less than the best. We too\r\noften read of serious and fatal complications following careless\r\nconclusions in similar cases, among which we may refer to one instance\r\nof a complete fracture manifesting itself in an animal during the act of\r\nrising in his stall after a decision had been pronounced that he had no\r\nfracture at all.\r\n\r\nFractures are of course liable to complications, especially those which\r\nare of a traumatic character, such as extensive lacerations, tearing of\r\ntissues, punctures, contusions, etc. Unless these are in communication\r\nwith the fracture itself the indication is to treat them simply as\r\nindependent lesions upon other parts of the body. A traumatic emphysema\r\nat times causes trouble, and abscesses, more or less deep and diffused,\r\nmay follow. In some cases small, bony fragments from a comminuted\r\nfracture, becoming loose and acting as foreign bodies, give rise to\r\ntroublesome fistulous tracts. A frequent complication is hemorrhage,\r\nwhich often becomes of serious consequence. A fracture in close\r\nproximity to a joint may be accompanied with dangerous inflammations of\r\nimportant organs, and induce an attack of pneumonia, pleurisy,\r\narthritis, etc., especially if near the chest; it may also cause\r\nluxations, or dislocations. Gangrene, as a consequence of contusions or\r\nof hemorrhage or of an impediment to the circulation, caused by\r\nunskillfully applied apparatus, must not be overlooked among the\r\noccasional incidents; nor must lockjaw, which is not an uncommon\r\noccurrence. Even founder, or laminitis, has been met with as the result\r\nof forced and long-continued immobility of the feet in the standing\r\nposture, as one of the involvements of unavoidably protracted treatment.\r\n\r\nWhen a simple fracture has been properly treated and the broken ends of\r\nthe bone have been securely held in coaptation, one of two things will\r\noccur. Either--and this is the more common event--there will be a union\r\nof the two ends by a solid cicatrix, the callus, or the ends will\r\ncontinue separated or become only partially united by an intermediate\r\nfibrous structure. In the first instance the fracture is consolidated or\r\nunited; in the second there is a false articulation, or pseudarthrosis.\r\n\r\nThe time required for a firm union or true consolidation of a fracture\r\nvaries with the character of the bone affected, the age and constitution\r\nof the patient, and the general conditions of the case. The union will\r\nbe perfected earlier in a young than in an adult animal, and sooner in\r\nthe latter than in the aged, and a general healthy condition is, of\r\ncourse, in every respect, an advantage.\r\n\r\nThe mode of cicatrization, or method of repair in lesions of the bones,\r\nhas been a subject of much study among investigators in pathology, and\r\nhas elicited various expressions of opinion from those high in\r\nauthority. The weight of evidence and preponderance of opinion are about\r\nsettled in favor of the theory that the law of reparation is the same\r\nfor both the hard and the soft tissues. In one case a simple exudation\r\nof material, with the proper organization of newly formed tissue, will\r\nbring about a union by the first intention, and in another the work will\r\nbe accompanied with suppuration, or union by the second intention, a\r\nprocess so familiar in the repair of the soft structures by granulation.\r\n\r\nConsidering the process in its simplest form, in a case in which it\r\nadvances without interruption or complication to a favorable result, it\r\nmay probably be correctly described in this wise:\r\n\r\nOn the occurrence of the injury an effusion of blood takes place between\r\nthe ends of the bone. The coagulation of the fluid soon follows, and\r\nthis, after a few days, undergoes absorption. There is then an excess of\r\ninflammation in the surrounding structure, which soon spreads to the\r\nbony tissue, when a true ostitis is established, and the compact tissue\r\nof the bone becomes the seat of a new vascular organization, and of a\r\ncertain exudation of plastic lymph, appearing between the periosteum and\r\nthe external surface of the bone, as well as on the inner side of the\r\nmedullary cavity. After a few days the ends of the bone thus surrounded\r\nby this exudate become involved in it, and the lymph, becoming vascular,\r\nis soon transformed into cartilaginous, and in due time into bony,\r\ntissue.\r\n\r\nThus the time required for the consolidation of the fractured segments\r\nis divisible into two distinct periods. In the first they are surrounded\r\nby an external bony ring, and the medullary cavity is closed by a bony\r\nplug or stopper, constituting the period of the provisional callus. This\r\nis followed by the period of permanent callus, during which the process\r\nof converting the cartilaginous into the osseous form is going forward.\r\n\r\nThe restorative process is sooner completed in the carnivorous than in\r\nthe herbivorous tribes. In the former the temporary callus may attain\r\nsufficient fineness of consistency for the careful use of the limb\r\nwithin four weeks, but with the latter a period of from six weeks to two\r\nmonths is not too long to allow before removing the supporting apparatus\r\nfrom the limb.\r\n\r\nThis, in general terms, represents the fact when the resources of nature\r\nhave not been thwarted by untoward accidents, such as a want of vigor in\r\nthe constitution of the patient or a lack of skill on the part of the\r\npractitioner, and especially when, from any cause, the bony fragments\r\nhave not been kept in a state of perfect immobility and the constant\r\nfriction has prevented the osseous union of the two portions. Failures\r\nand misfortunes are always more than possible, and instead of a solid\r\nand practicable bony union the sequel of the accident is sometimes a\r\nfalse joint, composed of mere flexible cartilage, a poor pseudarthrosis.\r\nThe explanation of this appears to be that, first, the sharp edges of\r\nthe ends of the bone disappear by becoming rounded at their extremities\r\nby friction and polishing against each other. Then follows an exudation\r\nof a plastic nature which becomes transformed into a cartilaginous layer\r\nof a rough, articular aspect. In this bony nuclei soon appear, and the\r\nlymph secreted between the segments thus transformed, instead of\r\nbecoming truly ossified, is changed into a sort of fibrocartilaginous\r\npouch, or capsular sac, in which a somewhat albuminous secretion, or\r\npseudo-synovia, permits the movement to take place. Most commonly,\r\nhowever, in our animals, the union of the bony fragments is obtained\r\nwholly through the medium of a layer of fibrous tissue, and it is\r\nbecause the union has been accomplished by a ligamentous formation only\r\nthat motion becomes practicable.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis._--The prognosis in a case of fracture in an animal is one of\r\nthe gravest vital import to the patient, and therefore of serious\r\npecuniary concern to his owner. The period has not long elapsed when to\r\nhave received such a hurt was quite equivalent to undergoing a sentence\r\nof death for the suffering animal, and perhaps to-day a similar verdict\r\nis pronounced in many cases in which the exercise of a little mechanical\r\ningenuity, with a due amount of careful nursing, might secure a contrary\r\nresult and insure the return of the patient to his former condition of\r\nsoundness and usefulness.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Considered per se, a fracture in an animal is in fact no\r\nless amenable to treatment than the same description of injury in any\r\nother living being. But the question of the propriety and expediency of\r\ntreatment is dependent upon certain specific points of collateral\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n(1) The nature of the lesion is a point of paramount importance. A\r\nsimple fracture occurring in a bone where the ends can be firmly secured\r\nin coaptation presents the most favorable condition for successful\r\ntreatment. If it is that of a long bone, it will be the less serious if\r\nsituated at or near the middle of its length than if it were in close\r\nproximity to a joint, from the fact that perfect immobility can rarely,\r\nin the latter case, be secured without incurring the risk of subsequent\r\nrigidity of the joint.\r\n\r\nA simple is always less serious than a compound fracture. A comminuted\r\nis always more dangerous than a simple, and a transverse break is easier\r\nto treat than one which is oblique. The most serious are those which are\r\nsituated on parts of the body in which it is difficult to obtain perfect\r\nimmobility, and especially those which are accompanied with severe\r\ncontusions and lacerations in the soft parts; the protrusion of\r\nfragments through the skin; the division of blood vessels by the broken\r\nends of the bone; the existence of an articulation near the point to\r\nwhich inflammation is liable to extend; the luxation of a fragment of\r\nthe bone; laceration of the periosteum; the presence of a large number\r\nof bony particles, the result of the crushing of the bone--all these are\r\ncircumstances which discourage a favorable prognosis, and weigh against\r\nthe hope of saving the patient for future usefulness.\r\n\r\nFractures which may be accounted curable are those which are not\r\nconspicuously visible, as those of the ribs, where displacements are\r\neither very limited or do not occur, the parts being kept in situ by the\r\nnature of their position, the shape of the bones, the articulations they\r\nform with the vertebra, the sternum, or their cartilages of\r\nprolongation; those of transverse processes of the lumbar vertebra;\r\nthose of the bones of the face; those of the ilium; and that of the\r\ncoffinbones. To continue the category, the following are evidently\r\ncurable when their position and the character of the patient contribute\r\nto aid the treatment: Those of the cranium, in the absence of cerebral\r\nlesions; those of the jaws; of the ribs, with displacement; of the hip;\r\nand those of the bones of the leg in movable regions, but where their\r\nvertical position admits of perfect coaptation.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, a compound, complicated, or comminuted, fracture, in\r\nwhatever region it may be situated, may be counted incurable.\r\n\r\nIn treating fractures time is an important element and \"delays are\r\ndangerous.\" Those of recent occurrence unite more easily and more\r\nregularly than older ones.\r\n\r\n(2) As a general rule, fractures are less serious in animals of the\r\nsmaller species than in those of more bulky dimensions. This influence\r\nof species will be readily appreciated when we realize that the\r\ndifficulties involved in the treatment of the latter class have hardly\r\nany existence in connection with the former. The difference in weight\r\nand size, and consequent facility in handling and making the necessary\r\napplications of dressings and other appliances for the purpose of\r\nsecuring the indispensable immobility of the parts, and usually a less\r\ndegree of uneasiness in the deportment of the patients are\r\nconsiderations in this connection of great weight.\r\n\r\n(3) In respect to the utilization of the animal, the most obvious point\r\nin estimating the gravity of the case in a fracture accident is the\r\ncertainty of the total loss of the services of the patient during\r\ntreatment--certainly for a considerable period of time; perhaps\r\npermanently. For example, the fracture of the jaw of a steer just\r\nfattening for the shambles will involve a heavier loss than a similar\r\naccident to a horse. Usually the fracture of the bones of the\r\nextremities in a horse is a very serious casualty, the more so\r\nproportionately as the higher region of the limb is affected. In working\r\nanimals it is exceedingly difficult to treat a fracture in such manner\r\nas to restore a limb to its original perfection of movement. A fracture\r\nof a single bone of an extremity in a breeding stallion or mare will not\r\nnecessarily impair the value of the animal as a breeder. Other\r\nspecifications under this head, though pertinent and more or less\r\ninteresting, may be omitted.\r\n\r\n(4) Age and temper are important factors of cure. A young, growing,\r\nrobust patient whose vis vitae is active is amenable to treatment which\r\none with a waning constitution and past mature energies would be unable\r\nto endure, and a docile, quiet disposition will act cooperatively with\r\nremedial measures which would be neutralized by the fractious opposition\r\nof a peevish and intractable sufferer.\r\n\r\nThe fulfillment of three indications is indispensable in all fractures.\r\nThe first is the reduction, or the replacement, of the parts as nearly\r\nas possible in their normal position. The second is their retention in\r\nthat position for a period sufficient for the formation of the\r\nprovisional callus, and the third, which, in fact, is but an incident of\r\nthe second, the careful avoidance of any accidents or causes of\r\nmiscarriage which might disturb the curative process.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the first consideration, it must be remembered that the\r\naccident may befall the patient at a distance from his home, and his\r\nremoval becomes the first duty to be attended to. Of course, this must\r\nbe done as carefully as possible. If he can be treated on the spot, so\r\nmuch the better, though this is seldom practicable, and the method of\r\nremoval becomes the question calling for settlement. But two ways\r\npresent themselves--he must either walk or be carried. If the first, it\r\nis needless to say that every caution must be observed in order to\r\nobviate additional pain and to avoid any aggravation of the injury. Led\r\nslowly, and with partial support, if practicable, the journey will not\r\nalways involve untoward results. If he is carried, it must be by means\r\nof a wagon, a truck, or an ambulance; the last being designed and\r\nadapted to the purpose, would, of course, be the most suitable vehicle.\r\nAs a precaution which should never be overlooked, a temporary dressing\r\nshould first be applied. This may be so done as for the time to answer\r\nall the purposes of the permanent adjustment and bandaging. Without thus\r\nsecuring the patient, a fracture of an inferior degree may be\r\ntransformed to one of the severest kind, and, indeed, a curable changed\r\nto an incurable injury. We recall a case in which a fast-trotting horse,\r\nafter running away in a fright caused by the whistle of a locomotive,\r\nwas found on the road limping with excessive lameness in the off fore\r\nleg, and walked with comparative ease some 2 miles to a stable before\r\nbeing seen by a surgeon. His immediate removal in an ambulance was\r\nadvised, but before that vehicle could be procured the horse lay down,\r\nand upon being made to get upon his feet was found with a well-marked\r\ncomminuted fracture of the os suffraginis, with considerable\r\ndisplacement. The patient, however, after long treatment, made a\r\ncomparatively good recovery and though with a large, bony deposit, a\r\nringbone, was able to trot in the forties.\r\n\r\nThe two obvious indications in cases of fracture are reduction, or\r\nreplacement, and retention.\r\n\r\nIn an incomplete fracture, where there is no displacement, the necessity\r\nof reduction does not exist. With the bone kept in place by an intact\r\nperiosteum, and the fragments secured by the uninjured fibrous and\r\nligamentous structure which surrounds them, there is no dislocation to\r\ncorrect. Reduction is also at times rendered impossible by the seat of\r\nthe fracture itself, by its dimensions, alone, or by the resistance\r\narising from muscular contraction. That is illustrated even in small\r\nanimals, as in dogs, by the exceeding difficulty encountered in\r\nbringing together the ends of a broken femur or humerus, the muscular\r\ncontractions being even in these animals sufficiently forcible to renew\r\nthe displacement.\r\n\r\nIt is generally, therefore, only fractures of the long bones, and then\r\nat points not in close proximity to the trunk, that may be considered to\r\nbe amenable to reduction. It is true that some of the more superficial\r\nbones, as those of the head, of the pelvis, and of the thoracic walls,\r\nmay in some cases require special manipulations and appliances for their\r\nretention in their normal positions; hence the treatment of these and of\r\na fractured leg can not be the same.\r\n\r\nThe methods of accomplishing reduction vary with the features of each\r\ncase, the manipulations being necessarily modified to meet different\r\ncircumstances. If the displacement is in the thickness of the bone, as\r\nin transverse fracture, the manipulation of reduction consists in\r\napplying constant pressure upon one of the fragments, while the other is\r\nkept steady in its place, the object of the pressure being the\r\nreestablishment of the exact coincidence of the two bony surfaces. If\r\nthe displacement has taken place at an angle it will be sufficient in\r\norder to effect the reduction to press upon the summit, or apex, of the\r\nangle until its disappearance indicates that the parts have been brought\r\ninto coaptation. This method is often practiced in the treatment of a\r\nfractured rib. In a longitudinal fracture, or when the fragments are\r\npressed together by the contraction of the muscles to which they give\r\ninsertion until they so overlap as to correspond by certain points of\r\ntheir circumference, the reduction is to be accomplished by effecting\r\nthe movements of extension, counter extension, and coaptation. Extension\r\nis accomplished by making traction upon the lower portion of the limb.\r\nCounter extension consists in firmly holding or confining the upper or\r\nbody portion in such manner, that it shall not be affected by the\r\ntraction applied to the lower part. In other words, the operator,\r\ngrasping the limb below the fracture, draws it down or away from the\r\ntrunk, while he seeks not to draw away, but simply to hold the upper\r\nportion still until the broken ends of bone are brought to their natural\r\nrelative positions, when the coaptation, which is thus effected, has\r\nonly to be made permanent by the proper dressings to perfect the\r\nreduction.\r\n\r\nIn treating fractures in small animals the strength of the hand is\r\nusually sufficient for the required manipulations. In the fracture of\r\nthe forearm of a dog, for example, while the upper segment is firmly\r\nheld by one hand the lower may be grasped by the other and the bone\r\nitself made to serve the purpose of a lever to bring about the desired\r\ncoaptation. In such case that is sufficient to overcome the muscular\r\ncontraction and correct the overlapping or other malposition of the\r\nbones. If, however, the resistance can not be overcome in this way, the\r\nupper segment may be committed to an assistant for the management of\r\nthe counter extension, leaving to the operator the free use of both\r\nhands for the further manipulation of the case.\r\n\r\nIf the reduction of fractures in small animals is an easy task, however,\r\nit is far from being so when the patient is a large animal whose\r\nmuscular force is largely greater than that of several men combined. In\r\nsuch case resort must be had not only to superior numbers for the\r\nnecessary force, but in many cases to mechanical aids. A reference to\r\nthe manner of proceeding in a case of fracture with displacement of the\r\nforearm of a horse will illustrate the matter. The patient is first to\r\nbe carefully cast, on the uninjured side, with ropes or a broad, leather\r\nstrap about 18 feet long passed under and around his body and under the\r\naxilla of the fractured limb and secured at a point opposite to the\r\nanimal and toward his back. This will form the mechanical means of\r\ncounter extension. Another rope will then be placed around the inferior\r\npart of the leg below the point of fracture, with which to produce\r\nextension, and this will sometimes be furnished with a block and\r\npulleys, in order to augment the power when necessary; there is, in\r\nfact, always an advantage in their use, on the side of steadiness and\r\nuniformity, as well as of increased power. It is secured around the\r\nfetlock or the coronet or, what is better, above the knee and nearer the\r\npoint of fracture, and is committed to assistants. The traction on this\r\nshould be firm, uniform, and slow, without relaxing or jerking, while\r\nthe operator carefully watches the process. If the bone is superficially\r\nsituated he is able, by the eye, to judge of any changes that may occur\r\nin the form or length of the parts under traction, and discovering, at\r\nthe moment of its happening, the restoration of symmetry in the\r\ndisturbed region he gently but firmly manipulates the place until all\r\nappearance of severed continuity has vanished. Sometimes the fact and\r\nthe instant of restoration are indicated by a peculiar sound or \"click\"\r\nas the ends of the bones slip into contact, to await the next step of\r\nthe restorative procedure.\r\n\r\nThe process is the same when the bones are covered with thick muscular\r\nmasses except that it is attended with greater difficulties from the\r\nfact that the finger must be substituted for the eye and taxis must take\r\nthe place of sight.\r\n\r\nIt frequently happens that perfect coaptation is prevented by the\r\ninterposition, between the bony surfaces, of such substances as a small\r\nfragment of detached bone or a clot of blood; sometimes the extreme\r\nobliquity of the fracture, by permitting the bones to slip out of place,\r\nis the opposing cause. These are difficulties which can not always be\r\novercome, even in small-sized animals, and still it is only when they\r\nare mastered that a correct consolidation can be looked for. Without it\r\nthe continuity between the fragments will be by a deformed callus, the\r\nunion will leave a shortened, crooked, or angular limb, and the animal\r\nwill be disabled.\r\n\r\nIf timely assistance can be obtained, and the reduction accomplished\r\nimmediately after the occurrence of the accident, that is the best time\r\nfor it, but if it can not be attended to until inflammation has become\r\nestablished and the parts have become swollen and painful, time must be\r\nallowed for the subsidence of these symptoms before attempting the\r\noperation. A spasmodic, muscular contraction which sometimes interposes\r\na difficulty may be easily overcome by subjecting the patient to general\r\nanesthesia, and need not, therefore, cause any loss of time. A tendency\r\nto this may also be overcome by the use of sedatives and antiphlogistic\r\nremedies.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of the fracture having been accomplished, the problem\r\nwhich follows is that of retention. The parts which have been restored\r\nto their natural position must be kept there, without disturbance or\r\nagitation, until the perfect formation of a callus, and it is here that\r\nample latitude exists for the exercise of ingenuity and skill by the\r\nsurgeon in the contrivance of the necessary apparatus. One of the most\r\nimportant of the conditions which are available by the surgeon in\r\ntreating human patients is denied to the veterinarian in the management\r\nof those which belong to the animal tribes. This is position. The\r\nintelligence of the human patient cooperates with the instructions of\r\nthe surgeon, in the case of the animal sufferer there is a continual\r\nantagonism between the parties, and the forced extension and fatiguing\r\nposition which must for a considerable period be maintained as a\r\ncondition of restoration require special and effective appliances to\r\ninsure successful results. To obtain complete immobility is scarcely\r\npossible, and the surgeon must be content to reach a point as near as\r\npossible to that which is unattainable. For this reason, as will\r\nsubsequently be seen, the use of slings and the restraint of patients in\r\nvery narrow stalls is much to be preferred to the practice sometimes\r\nrecommended of allowing entire freedom of motion by turning them loose\r\nin box stalls. Temporary and movable apparatus are not usually of\r\ndifficult use in veterinary practice, but the restlessness of the\r\npatients and their unwillingness to submit quietly to the changing of\r\nthe dressings render it obligatory to have recourse to permanent and\r\nimmovable bandages, which should be retained without disturbance until\r\nthe process of consolidation is complete.\r\n\r\nThe materials composing the retaining apparatus consist of oakum,\r\nbandages, and splints, with an agglutinating compound which forms a\r\nspecies of cement by which the different constituents are blended into a\r\nconsistent mass to be spread upon the surface covering the locality of\r\nthe fracture. Its components are black pitch, rosin, and Venice\r\nturpentine, blended by heat. The dressing may be applied directly to\r\nthe skin, or a covering of thin linen may be interposed. A putty made\r\nwith powdered chalk and the white of egg is recommended for small\r\nanimals, though a mixture of sugar of lead and burnt alum with the\r\nalbumen is preferred by others. Another formula is spirits of camphor,\r\nGoulard's extract, and albumen. Another recommendation is to saturate\r\nthe oakum and bandages with an adhesive solution formed with gum arabic,\r\ndextrin, flour paste, or starch. This is advised particularly for small\r\nanimals, as is also the silicate of soda. Dextrin mixed while warm with\r\nburnt alum and alcohol cools and solidifies into a stony consistency,\r\nand is preferable to plaster of Paris, which is less friable and has\r\nless solidity, besides being heavier and requiring constant additions as\r\nit becomes older. Starch and plaster of Paris form another good\r\ncompound.\r\n\r\nIn applying the dressing the leg is usually padded with a cushion of\r\noakum thick and soft enough to equalize the irregularities of the\r\nsurface and to form a bedding for the protection of the skin from\r\nchafing. Over this the splints are placed. The material for these is,\r\nvariously, pasteboard, thin wood, bark, laths, gutta-percha, strips of\r\nthin metal, as tin or perhaps sheet iron. They should be of sufficient\r\nlength not only to cover the region of the fracture but to extend\r\nsufficiently above and below to render the immobility more nearly\r\ncomplete than in the surrounding joints. The splints, again, are covered\r\nwith cloth bandages--linen preferably--soaked in a glutinous mixture.\r\nThese bandages are to be carefully applied, with a perfect condition of\r\nlightness. They are usually made to embrace the entire length of the leg\r\nin order to avoid the possibility of interference with the circulation\r\nof the extremity as well as for the prevention of chafing. They should\r\nbe rolled from the lower part of the leg upward and carefully secured\r\nagainst loosening. In some instances suspensory bandages are\r\nrecommended, but except for small animals our experience does not\r\njustify a concurrence in the recommendation.\r\n\r\nThese permanent dressings always need careful watching with reference to\r\ntheir immediate effect upon the region they cover, especially during the\r\nfirst days succeeding that of their application. Any manifestation of\r\npain, or any appearance of swelling above or below, or any odor\r\nsuggestive of suppuration should excite suspicion, and a thorough\r\ninvestigation should follow without delay. The removal of the dressing\r\nshould be performed with great care, and especially so if time enough\r\nhas elapsed since its application to allow of a probability of a\r\ncommencement of the healing process or the existence of any points of\r\nconsolidation. With the original dressing properly applied in its\r\nentirety in the first instance, the entire extremity will have lost all\r\nchance of mobility, and the repairing process may be permitted to\r\nproceed without interference. There will be no necessity and there need\r\nbe no haste for removal or change except under such special conditions\r\nas have just been mentioned, or when there is reason to judge that\r\nsolidification has become perfect, or for the comfort of the animal, or\r\nfor its readaptation in consequence of the atrophy of the limb from want\r\nof use. Owners of animals are often tempted to remove a splint or\r\nbandage prematurely at the risk of producing a second fracture in\r\nconsequence of the failure of the callus properly to consolidate.\r\n\r\nThe method of applying the splints which we have described refers to the\r\nsimple variety only. In a compound case the same rules must be observed,\r\nwith the modification of leaving openings through the thickness of the\r\ndressing, opposite the wound, in order to permit the escape of pus and\r\nto secure access to the points requiring the application of treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURE OF CRANIAL BONES.\r\n\r\nFractures of the cranial bones in large animals are comparatively rare,\r\nthough the records are not destitute of cases. When they occur, it is as\r\nthe result of external violence, the sufferers being usually run-aways\r\nwhich have come in collision with a wall or a tree or other obstruction,\r\nor it may occur in those which in pulling upon the halter have broken it\r\nwith a jerk and been thrown backward, as may occur in rearing too\r\nviolently. Under these conditions we have witnessed fractures of the\r\nparietal, of the frontal, and of the sphenoid bones. These fractures may\r\nbe of both the complete and the incomplete kinds, which indeed is\r\nusually the case with those of the flat bones, and they are liable to be\r\ncomplicated with lacerations of the skin, in consequence of which they\r\nare easily brought under observation. When the fact is otherwise and the\r\nskin is intact, however, the diagnosis becomes difficult.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The incomplete variety may be unaccompanied with any\r\nspecial symptoms, but in the complete kind one of the bony plates may be\r\nso far detached as to press upon the cerebral substance with sufficient\r\nforce to produce serious nervous complications. When the injury occurs\r\nat the base of the cranium hemorrhage may be looked for, with paralytic\r\nsymptoms, and when these are present the usual termination is death. It\r\nmay happen, however, that the symptoms of an apparently very severe\r\nconcussion may disappear, resulting in an early and complete recovery,\r\nand the surgeon will therefore do well to avoid undue haste in venturing\r\nupon a prognosis. In fractures of the orbital or the zygomatic bones the\r\ndanger is less pressing than with injuries otherwise located about the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment of cranial fractures is simple, though\r\ninvolving the best skill of an experienced surgeon. When incomplete\r\nhardly any interference is needed; even plain bandaging may usually be\r\ndispensed with. In the complete variety the danger to be combated is\r\ncompression of the brain, and attention to this indication must not be\r\ndelayed. The means to be employed are the trephining of the skull over\r\nthe seat of the fracture and the elevation of the depressed bone or the\r\nremoval of the portion which is causing the trouble. Fragments of bone\r\nin comminuted cases, bony exfoliations, collections of fluid, or even\r\nprotruding portions of the brain substance must be carefully cleansed\r\naway and a simple bandage so applied as to facilitate the application of\r\nsubsequent dressings.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURES OF THE BONES OF THE FACE.\r\n\r\nIn respect to their origin--usually traumatic--these injuries rank with\r\nthe preceding, and are commonly of the incomplete variety. They may\r\neasily be overlooked, and may even sometimes escape recognition until\r\nthe reparative process has been well established and the wound is\r\ndiscovered owing to the prominence caused by the presence of the\r\nprovisional callus which marks its cure. When the fracture is complete\r\nit will be marked by local deformity, mobility of the fragments, and\r\ncrepitation. Nasal hemorrhage, roaring, frequent sneezing, loosening or\r\nloss of teeth, difficulty of mastication, and inflammation of the\r\ncavities of the sinuses are varying complications of these accidents.\r\nThe object of the treatment should be the restoration of the depressed\r\nbones as nearly as possible to their normal position and their retention\r\nin place by protecting splints, which should cover the entire facial\r\nregion. Special precautions should be observed to prevent the patient\r\nfrom disturbing the dressing by rubbing his head against surrounding\r\nobjects, such as the stall, manger, rack, etc. Clots of blood in the\r\nnasal passages must be washed out, collections of pus removed from the\r\nsinuses, and, if the teeth are loosened and liable to fall out, they\r\nshould be removed. If roaring is threatened, tracheotomy is indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURES OF THE PREMAXILLARY BONE.\r\n\r\nThese are mentioned by continental authors and are usually encountered\r\nin connection with fractures of the nasal bone, and may take place\r\neither in the width or the length of the bone.\r\n\r\nThe deformity of the upper lip, which is drawn sidewise in this lesion,\r\nrenders it easy of diagnosis. The abnormal mobility and the crepitation,\r\nwith the pain manifested by the patient when undergoing examination, are\r\nconcurrent symptoms. Looseness of the teeth, abundant salivation, and\r\nentire inability to grasp the feed complete the symptomatology of these\r\naccidents. In the treatment splints of gutta-percha or leather are\r\nsometimes used, but they are of difficult application. Our own judgment\r\nand practice are in favor of the union of the bones by means of metallic\r\nsutures.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURES OF THE LOWER JAW.\r\n\r\nA fracture here is not an injury of infrequent occurrence. It involves\r\nthe body of the bone, at its symphysis, or back of it, and includes one\r\nor both of its branches, either more or less forward, or at the\r\nposterior part near the temporomaxillary articulation, at the coronoid\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nFalls, blows, or other external violence, or powerful muscular\r\ncontractions during the use of the speculum, may be mentioned among the\r\ncauses of this lesion. The fracture of the neck, or that portion formed\r\nby the juncture of the two opposite sides, and of the branches in front\r\nof the cheeks, causes the lower jaw, the true dental arch, to drop,\r\nwithout the ability to raise it again to the upper, and the result is a\r\npeculiar and characteristic physiognomy. The prehension and mastication\r\nof feed become impossible; there is an abundant escape of fetid and\r\nsometimes bloody saliva, especially if the gums have been wounded; there\r\nis excessive mobility of the lower end of the jawbone; and there is\r\ncrepitation, and frequently paralysis of the under lip. Although an\r\nanimal suffering with a complete and often compound and comminuted\r\nfracture of the submaxilla presents at times a serious aspect, the\r\nprognosis of the case is comparatively favorable, and recovery is\r\nusually only a question of time. The severity of the lesion corresponds\r\nin degree to that of the violence to which it is due, also to the\r\nresulting complications and the situation of the wound. It is simple\r\nwhen at the symphysis, but becomes more serious when it affects one of\r\nthe branches, and most aggravated when both are involved. Fracture of\r\nthe coronoid process becomes important principally as an evidence of the\r\nexistence of a morbid diathesis, such as osteoporosis, or the like.\r\n\r\nThe particular seat of the injury, with its special features, will, of\r\ncourse, determine the treatment. For a simple fracture, without\r\ndisplacement, provided there is no laceration of the periosteum, an\r\nordinary supporting bandage will usually be sufficient, but when there\r\nis displacement the reduction of the fracture must first be\r\naccomplished, and for this special splints are necessary. In a fracture\r\nof the symphysis or of the branches the adjustment of the fragments by\r\nsecuring them with metallic sutures is the first step necessary, to be\r\nfollowed by the application of supports, consisting of splints of\r\nleather or sheets of metal, the entire front of the head being then\r\ncovered with bandages prepared with adhesive mixtures. During the entire\r\ncourse of treatment a special method of feeding becomes necessary. The\r\ninability of the patient to appreciate the situation, of course,\r\nnecessitates a resort to an artificial mode of introducing the necessary\r\nfeed into his stomach; this is accomplished by forcing between the\r\ncommissures of the lips, in a liquid form, by means of a syringe, the\r\nmilk or nutritive gruels selected for his sustenance until the\r\nconsolidation is sufficiently advanced to permit the ingestion of feed\r\nof a more solid consistency. The callus will usually be sufficiently\r\nhardened in two or three weeks to allow of a change of diet to mashes of\r\ncut hay and scalded grain, until the removal of the dressing restores\r\nthe animal to its old habit of mastication.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURES OF VERTEBRAE.\r\n\r\nThese are not very common, but when they do occur the bones most\r\nfrequently injured are those of the back and loins.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--The ordinary causes of fracture are responsible here as\r\nelsewhere, such as heavy blows on the spinal column, severe falls while\r\nconveying heavy loads, and especially violent efforts in resisting the\r\nprocess of casting. Although occurring more or less frequently under the\r\nlatter circumstances, the accident is not always attributable to\r\ncarelessness or error in the management. It may, of course, sometimes\r\nresult from such a cause as a badly prepared bed, or the accidental\r\npresence of a hard body concealed in the straw, or to a heavy fall when\r\nthe movements of the patient have not been sufficiently controlled by an\r\neffective apparatus and its skillful adaptation, but it is quite as\r\nliable to be caused by the violent resistance and the consequent\r\npowerful muscular contraction by the frightened patient. The simple fact\r\nof the overarching of the vertebral column, with excessive pressure\r\nagainst it from the intestinal mass, owing to the spasmodic action of\r\nthe abdominal muscles, may account for it, and so also may the struggles\r\nof the animal to escape from the restraint of the hobbles while frantic\r\nunder the pain of an operation without anesthesia. In these cases the\r\nfracture usually occurs in the body or the annular part, or both, of the\r\nposterior dorsal or the anterior lumbar vertebra. When the transverse\r\nprocesses of the last-named bones are injured, it is probably in\r\nconsequence of the heavy concussion incident to striking the ground when\r\ncast. The diagnosis of a fracture of the body of a vertebra is not\r\nalways easy, especially when quite recent, and more especially when\r\nthere is no accompanying displacement.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--There are certain peculiar signs accompanying the\r\noccurrence of the accident while an operation is in progress which\r\nshould at once excite the suspicion of the surgeon. In the midst of a\r\nviolent struggle the patient becomes suddenly quiet; the movement of a\r\nsharp instrument, which at first excited his resistance, fails to give\r\nrise to any further evidence of sensation; perhaps a general trembling,\r\nlasting for a few minutes, will follow, succeeded by a cold, profuse\r\nperspiration, particularly between the hind legs, and frequently there\r\nwill be micturition and defecation. Careful examination of the vertebral\r\ncolumn may then detect a slight depression or irregularity in the\r\ndirection of the spine, and there may be a diminution or loss of\r\nsensation in the posterior part of the trunk, while the anterior portion\r\ncontinues to be as sensitive as before. In making an attempt to get upon\r\nhis feet, however, upon the removal of the hobbles, only the fore part\r\nof the body will respond to the effort, a degree of paraplegia being\r\npresent, and while the head, neck, and fore part of the body will be\r\nraised, the hind quarters and hind legs will remain inert. The animal\r\nmay perhaps succeed in rising and probably may be removed to his stall,\r\nbut the displacement of the bone will follow, converting the fracture\r\ninto one of the complete kind, either through the exertion of walking or\r\nby a renewed attempt to rise after another fall before reaching his\r\nstall. By this time the paralysis is complete, and the extension of the\r\nmeningitis, which has become established, is a consummation soon\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nTo say that the prognosis of fracture of the body of the vertebra is\r\nalways serious is to speak very mildly. It would be better, perhaps, to\r\nsay that _occasionally_ a case _may_ recover. Fractures of the\r\ntransverse processes are less serious.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Instead of stating the indication in this class of cases\r\nas if assuming them to be amenable to treatment, the question naturally\r\nwould be: Can any treatment be recommended in a fracture of the body of\r\na vertebra? The only indication in such a case, in our opinion, is to\r\nreach the true diagnosis in the shortest possible time and to act\r\naccordingly. If there is displacement, and the existence of serious\r\nlesions may be inferred from the nervous symptoms, the destruction of\r\nthe suffering animal appears to suggest itself as the one conclusion in\r\nwhich considerations of policy, humanity, and science at once unite.\r\n\r\nIf, however, it is fairly evident that no displacement exists; that\r\npressure upon the spinal cord is not yet present; that the animal with a\r\nlittle assistance is able to rise upon his feet and to walk a short\r\ndistance--it may be well to experiment upon the case to the extent of\r\nplacing the patient in the most favorable circumstances for recovery and\r\nallow nature to operate without further interference. This may be\r\naccomplished by obtaining immobility of the whole body as much as\r\npossible, and especially of the suspected region, by placing the patient\r\nin slings, in a stall sufficiently narrow to preclude lateral motion,\r\nand covering the loins with a thick coat of agglutinative mixture.\r\nDevelopments should be watched and awaited.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURE OF THE RIBS.\r\n\r\nThe different regions of the chest are not equally exposed to the\r\nviolence that causes fractures of the ribs, and they are therefore\r\neither more common or more easily discovered during life at some points\r\nthan at others. The more exposed regions are the middle and the\r\nposterior, while the front is largely covered and defended by the\r\nshoulder. A single rib may be the seat of fracture, or a number may be\r\ninvolved, and there may be injuries on both sides of the chest at the\r\nsame time. It may take place lengthwise, in any part of the bone, though\r\nthe middle, being the most exposed, is the most frequently hurt.\r\nIncomplete fractures are usually lengthwise, involving a portion only of\r\nthe thickness of one or other of the surfaces. The complete kind may be\r\neither transverse or oblique, and are most commonly denticulated. The\r\nfracture may be comminuted, and a single bone may show one of the\r\ncomplete and one of the incomplete kind at different points. The extent\r\nof surface presented by the thoracic region, with its complete exposure\r\nat all points, explains the liability of the ribs to suffer from all the\r\nforms of external violence.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--In many instances fractures, especially the incomplete\r\nvariety, of these bones continue undiscovered, without displacement,\r\nthough the evidences of local pain, a certain amount of swelling, and a\r\ndegree of disturbance of the respiration, if noticed during the\r\nexamination of a patient, may suggest a suspicion of their existence.\r\nAbnormal mobility and crepitation are difficult of detection, even when\r\npresent, and they are not always present. When there is displacement the\r\ndeformity which it occasions will betray the fact, and when such an\r\ninjury exists the surgeon, in view of possible and probable\r\ncomplications of thoracic trouble, of course will become vigilant and\r\nprepare himself for an encounter with a case of traumatic pleuritis or\r\npneumonia. Fatal injuries of the heart are recorded. Subcutaneous\r\nemphysema is a common accompaniment of broken ribs, and I recall the\r\ndeath, from this cause, of a patient of my own which had suffered a\r\nfracture of two ribs in the region of the withers, under the cartilages\r\nof the shoulder, and of which the diagnosis was made only after the\r\nfatal ending of the case.\r\n\r\nThese hurts are not often of a very serious character, though the union\r\nis never so solid and complete as in other fractures, the callus being\r\nusually imperfect and of a fibrous character, with an amphiarthrosis\r\nformation. Still, complications occur which may impart gravity to the\r\nprognosis.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Fractures with but a slight or no displacement need no\r\nreduction. All that is necessary is a simple application of a blistering\r\nnature as a preventive of inflammation or for its subjugation when\r\npresent, and in order to excite an exudation which will tend to aid in\r\nthe support and immobilization of the parts. At times, however, a better\r\neffect is obtained by the application of a bandage placed firmly around\r\nthe chest, although, while this limits the motion of the ribs, it is\r\nliable to render the respiration more labored.\r\n\r\nIf there is displacement, with much accompanying pain and evident\r\nirritation of the lungs, the fracture must be reduced without delay.\r\nThe means of effecting this vary according to whether the displacement\r\nis outward or inward. In the first case the bone may be straightened by\r\npressure from without, while in the second the end of it must be raised\r\nby a lever, for the introduction of which a small incision through the\r\nskin and intercostal spaces will be necessary. When coaptation has been\r\neffected it must be retained by the external application of an adhesive\r\nmixture, with splints and bandages around the chest.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURES OF THE BONES OF THE PELVIS.\r\n\r\nThese fractures will be considered under their separate denominations,\r\nas those of the sacrum and the os innominatum, or hip, which includes\r\nthe subdivisions of the ilium, the pubes, and the ischium.\r\n\r\n_The sacrum._--Fractures of this bone are rarely met with among\r\nsolipeds. Among cattle, however, it is of common occurrence, being\r\nattributed not only to the usual varieties of violence, as blows and\r\nother external hurts, but to the act of coition and violent efforts in\r\nparturition. It is generally of the transverse kind and may be\r\nrecognized by the deformity which it occasions. This is due to the\r\ndropping of the bone, with a change in its direction and a lower\r\nattachment of the tail, which also becomes more or less paralyzed. The\r\nnatural and spontaneous relief which usually interposes in these cases\r\nhas doubtless been observed by the extensive cattle breeders of the\r\nWest, and their practice and example fully establish the inutility of\r\ninterference. Still, cases may occur in which reduction may be\r\nindicated, and it then becomes a matter of no difficulty. It is effected\r\nby the introduction of a round, smooth piece of wood into the rectum as\r\nfar as the fragment of bone and using it as a lever, resting upon\r\nanother as a fulcrum placed under it outside. The bone, having been thus\r\nreturned, may be kept in place by the ordinary external means in use.\r\n\r\n_The os innominatum._--Fracture of the ilium may be observed either at\r\nthe angle of the hip or at the neck of the bone; those of the pubes may\r\ntake place at the symphysis, or in the body of the bone; those of the\r\nischium on the floor of the bone, or at its posterior external angle.\r\nOr, again, the fracture may involve all three of these constituent parts\r\nof the hip bone by having its situation in the articular cavity--the\r\nacetabulum by which it joins the femur or thigh bone.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Some of these fractures are easily recognized, while others\r\nare difficult to identify. The ordinary deformity which characterizes a\r\nfracture of the external angle of the ilium, its dropping and the\r\ndiminution of that side of the hip in width, unite in indicating the\r\nexistence of the condition expressed by the term \"hipped.\" An incomplete\r\nfracture, however, or one that is complete without displacement, or even\r\none with displacement, often demands the closest scrutiny for its\r\ndiscovery. The lameness may be well marked, and an animal may show it\r\nbut little while walking, though upon being urged into a trot will\r\nmanifest it more and more, until presently it will cease to use the\r\ncrippled limb altogether, and travel entirely on three legs. The acute\r\ncharacter of the lameness will vary in degree as the seat of the lesion\r\napproximates the acetabulum. In walking, the motion at the hip is very\r\nlimited, and the leg is dragged; while at rest it is relieved from\r\nbearing its share in sustaining the body. An intelligent opinion and\r\ncorrect conclusion will depend largely upon a knowledge of the history\r\nof the case, and while in some instances that will be but a report of\r\nthe common etiology of fractures, such as blows, hurts, and other\r\nexternal violence, the simple fact of a fall may furnish in a single\r\nword a satisfactory solution of the whole matter.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the deformity of the ilium in a fracture of its\r\nexternal angle, and unless there has been a serious laceration of\r\ntissues and infiltration of blood, or excessive displacement, there are\r\nno very definite external symptoms in a case of a fracture of the hip\r\nbone. There is one, however, which, in a majority of cases, will not\r\nfail--it is crepitation. This evidence is attainable by both external\r\nand internal examination--by manipulation of the gluteal surface and by\r\nrectal taxis. Very often a lateral motion, or balancing of the hinder\r\nparts by pressing the body from one side to the other, will be\r\nsufficient to render the crepitation more distinct--a slight sensation\r\nof grating, which may be perceived even through the thick coating of\r\nmuscle which covers the bone--and the sensation may not only be felt,\r\nbut to the expert may even become audible. This external manifestation\r\nis, however, not always sufficient in itself, and should invariably be\r\nassociated with the rectal taxis for corroboration. It is true that this\r\nmay fail to add to the evidence of fracture, but till then the simple\r\ntestimony afforded by the detection of crepitation from the surface,\r\nthough a strong confirmatory point, is scarcely sufficiently absolute to\r\nestablish more than a reasonable probability or strong suspicion in the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the fact that the rectal examination brings the exploring\r\nhand of the surgeon into near proximity to the desired point of search,\r\nand to an accurate knowledge of the situation of parts, both pro and con\r\nas respects his own views, there is another advantage attendant upon it\r\nwhich is well entitled to appreciation. This is the facility with which\r\nhe can avail himself of the help of an assistant, who can aid him by\r\nmanipulating the implicated limb and placing it in various positions, so\r\nfar as the patient will permit, while the surgeon himself is making\r\nexplorations and studying the effect from within. By this method he can\r\nhardly fail to ascertain the character of the fracture and the condition\r\nof the bony ends. By the rectal taxis, as if with eyes in the finger\r\nends, he will \"see\" what is the extent of the fracture of the ilium or\r\nof the neck of that bone; to what part of the central portion of the\r\nbone (the acetabulum) it reaches; whether this is free from disease or\r\nnot, and in what location on the floor of the pelvis the lesion is\r\nsituated. By this method we have frequently been able to detect a\r\nfracture at the symphysis, which, from its history and symptoms and an\r\nexternal examination, could only have been guessed at. Yet, with all its\r\nadvantages, the rectal examination is not always necessary, as, for\r\nexample, when the fracture is at the posterior and external angle of the\r\nischium, when by friction of the bony ends the surgeon may discern the\r\ncrepitation without it.\r\n\r\nEvery variety of complication, including muscular lacerations with the\r\nformation of deep abscesses and injuries to the organs of the pelvic\r\ncavity, the bladder, the rectum, and the uterus, may be associated with\r\nfractures of the hip bone.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis._--The prognosis of these lesions will necessarily vary\r\nconsiderably. A fracture of the most superficial part of the bone of the\r\nilium or of the ischium, especially if there is little displacement,\r\nwill unite rapidly, leaving a comparatively sound animal often quite\r\nfree from subsequent lameness. If there is much displacement, however,\r\nonly a ligamentous union will take place, with much deformity and more\r\nor less irregularity in the gait. Other fractures may be followed by\r\ncomplete disability of the patient, as, for example, when the cotyloid\r\ncavity is involved, or when the reparatory process has left bony\r\ndeposits in the pelvic cavity at the seat of the union, which may, in\r\nthe case of the female, interfere with the steps of parturition, or\r\ninduce some local paralysis by pressure upon the nerves which govern the\r\nmuscles of the hind legs. This is a condition not infrequently observed\r\nwhen the callus has been formed on the floor of the pelvis near the\r\nobturator foramen, pressing upon the course or involving the obturator\r\nnerve.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In our estimation, the treatment of all fractures of the\r\nhip bone should be of the simplest kind. Rendered comparatively\r\nimmovable by the thickness of the muscles by which the region is\r\nenveloped, one essential indication suggests itself, and that is to\r\nplace the animal in a position which, so far as possible, will be fixed\r\nand permanent. For the accomplishment of this purpose the best measure,\r\nas we consider it, is to place the horse in a stall of just sufficient\r\nwidth to admit him, and to apply a set of slings, snugly, but\r\ncomfortably. (See Plate XXXI.) This will fulfill the essential\r\nconditions of recovery--rest and immobility. Blistering applications\r\nwould be injurious, though the adhesive mixture might prove in some\r\ndegree beneficial.\r\n\r\nThe minimum period allowable for solid union in a fractured hip is, in\r\nour judgment, two months, and we have known cases in which that was too\r\nshort a time.\r\n\r\nAs we have said before, there may be cases in which the treatment for\r\nfracture at the floor of the pelvis has been followed by symptoms of\r\npartial paralysis, the animal, when lying down, being unable to regain\r\nhis feet, but moving freely when placed in an upright position. This\r\ncondition is owing to the interference of the callus with the functions\r\nof the obturator nerve, which it presses upon or surrounds. By my\r\nexperience in similar cases I feel warranted in cautioning owners of\r\nhorses in this condition to exercise due patience, and to avoid a\r\npremature sentence of condemnation against their invalid servants; they\r\nare not all irrecoverably paralytic. With alternations of moderate\r\nexercise, rest in the slings, and the effect of time while the natural\r\nprocess of absorption is taking effect upon the callus, with other\r\nelements of change that may be so operating, the horse in due time may\r\nbecome able once more to earn his subsistence and serve his master.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURE OF THE SCAPULA.\r\n\r\nThis bone is seldom fractured, its comparative exemption being due to\r\nits free mobility and the protection it receives from the superimposed\r\nsoft tissues. Only direct and powerful causes are sufficient to effect\r\nthe injury, and when it occurs the large rather than the smaller animals\r\nare the subjects.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--The causes are heavy blows or kicks and violent collisions\r\nwith unyielding objects. Those which are occasioned by falls are\r\ngenerally at the neck of the bone, and of the transverse and comminuted\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The diagnosis is not always easy. The symptoms are\r\ninability to rest the leg on the ground and to carry weights, and they\r\nare present in various degrees from slight to severe. The leg rests upon\r\nthe toe, seems shortened, and locomotion is performed by jumps. Moving\r\nthe leg while examining it and raising the foot for inspection seem to\r\nproduce much pain and cause the animal to rear. Crepitation is readily\r\nfelt with the hand upon the shoulder when the leg is moved. If the\r\nfracture occurs in the upper part of the bone, overlapping of the\r\nfragments and displacement will be considerable.\r\n\r\nThe fracture of this bone is usually classed among the more serious\r\naccidents, though cases may occur which are followed by recovery without\r\nvery serious ultimate results, especially when the seat of the injury is\r\nat some of the upper angles of the bone or about the acromion crest. But\r\nif the neck and the joint are the parts involved, complications which\r\nare likely to disable the animal for life are liable to be present.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--If there is no displacement, a simple adhesive dressing to\r\nstrengthen and immobilize the parts will be sufficient. A coat of black\r\npitch dissolved with wax and Venice turpentine, and kept in place over\r\nthe region with oakum or linen bands, will be all the treatment\r\nrequired, especially if the animal is kept quiet in the slings.\r\n\r\nDisplacement can not be remedied, and reduction is next to impossible.\r\nSometimes an iron plate is applied over the parts and retained by\r\nbandages, as in the dressing of Bourgelat (Plate XXX); this may be\r\nadvantageously replaced by a pad of thick leather. In smaller animals\r\nthe parts are retained by figure-8 bandages, embracing both the normal\r\nand the diseased shoulders, crossing each other in the axilla and\r\ncovered with a coating of adhesive mixture.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURES OF THE HUMERUS.\r\n\r\nThese are more common in small than in large animals, and are always the\r\nresult of external traumatism, such as falls, kicks, and collisions.\r\nThey are generally very oblique, are often comminuted, and though more\r\nusually involving the shaft of the bone will in some cases extend to the\r\nupper end and into the articular head.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--There is ordinarily considerable displacement in\r\nconsequence of the overlapping of the broken ends of the bone, and this\r\nof course causes more or less shortening of the limb. There will also be\r\nswelling, with difficulty of locomotion, and crepitation will be easy of\r\ndetection. This fracture is always a serious damage to the patient,\r\nleaving him with a permanently shortened limb and an incurable, lifelong\r\nlameness.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--If treatment is determined on, it will consist in the\r\nreduction of the fracture by means of extension and counter extension,\r\nto accomplish which the animal must be thrown. If successful in the\r\nreduction, then follows the application and adjustment of the apparatus\r\nof retention, which must be of the most perfect and efficient kind.\r\nFinally, this, however skillfully contrived and carefully adapted, will\r\noften fail to effect any good purpose whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURES OF THE FOREARM.\r\n\r\nA fracture in this region may also involve the radius or the ulna, the\r\nlatter being broken at times in its upper portion above the radio-ulnar\r\narch at the olecranon. If the fracture occurs at any part of the forearm\r\nfrom the radio-ulnar arch down to the knee, it may involve either the\r\nradius alone or the radius and the cubitus, which are there intimately\r\nunited.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--Besides having the same etiology with most of the fractures,\r\nthose of the forearm are, nevertheless, more commonly due to kicks from\r\nother animals, especially when crowded together in large numbers in\r\ninsufficient space. It is a matter of observation that under these\r\ncircumstances fractures of the incomplete kind are those which occur on\r\nthe inside of the leg, the bone being in that region almost entirely\r\nsubcutaneous, while those of the complete class are either oblique or\r\ntransverse. The least common are the longitudinal, in the long axis of\r\nthe bone.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--This variety of fracture is easily recognized by the\r\nappearance of the leg and the different changes it undergoes. There is\r\ninability to use the limb; impossibility of locomotion; mobility below\r\nthe injury; the ready detection of crepitation--in a word, the\r\nassemblage of all the signs and symptoms which have been already\r\nconsidered as associated with the history of broken bones.\r\n\r\nThe fracture of the ulna alone, principally above the radio-ulnar arch,\r\nmay be ascertained by the aggravated lameness, the excessive soreness on\r\npressure, and perhaps a certain increase of motion, with a very slight\r\ncrepitation if tested in the usual way. Displacement is not likely to\r\ntake place except when it is well up toward the olecranon or its\r\ntuberosity, the upper segment of the bone being in that case likely to\r\nbe drawn upward. For a simple fracture of this region there is a fair\r\nchance of recovery, but in a case of the compound and comminuted class\r\nthere is less ground for a favorable prognosis, especially if the elbow\r\njoint has suffered injury. A fracture of the ulna alone is not of\r\nserious importance, except when the same conditions prevail. A fracture\r\nof the olecranon is less amenable to treatment, and promises little\r\nbetter than a ligamentous union.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Considering all the various conditions involving the\r\nnature and extent of these lesions, the position and direction of the\r\nbones of the forearm are such as to render the chances for recovery from\r\nfracture as among the best. The reduction, by extension and\r\ncounterextension; the maintenance of the coaptation of the segments; the\r\nadaptation of the dressing by splints, oakum, and agglutinative\r\nmixtures; in fact, all the details of treatment may be here fulfilled\r\nwith a degree of facility and precision not attainable in any other part\r\nof the organism. An important, if not an essential, point, however, must\r\nbe emphasized in regard to the splints. Whether they are of metal, wood,\r\nor other material, they should reach from the elbow joint to the ground,\r\nand should be placed on the posterior face and on both sides of the leg.\r\nThis is then to be so confined in a properly constructed box as to\r\npreclude all possibility of motion, while yet it must sustain a certain\r\nportion of the weight of the body. The iron splint (represented in Plate\r\nXXX) recommended by Bourgelat is designed for fractures of the forearm,\r\nof the knee, and of the cannon bone, and will prove to be an appliance\r\nof great value. For small animals the preference is for an external\r\ncovering of gutta-percha, embracing the entire leg. A sheet of this\r\nsubstance of suitable thickness, according to the size of the animal,\r\nsoftened in lukewarm water, is, when sufficiently pliable, molded on the\r\noutside of the leg, and when suddenly hardened by the application of\r\ncold water forms a complete casing sufficiently rigid to resist all\r\nmotion. Patients treated in this manner have been able to use the limb\r\nfreely, without pain, immediately after the application of the dressing.\r\nThe removal of the splint is easily effected by cutting it away, either\r\nwholly or in sections, after softening it by immersing the leg in a warm\r\nbath.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURE OF THE KNEE.\r\n\r\nThis accident, happily, is of rare occurrence, but when it takes place\r\nis of a severe character, and always accompanied with synovitis, with\r\ndisease of the joint.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--It may be caused by falling upon a hard surface, and is\r\nusually compound and comminuted. Healing seldom occurs, and when it does\r\nthere is usually a stiffness of the joint from arthritis.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--As a result of this fracture there is inability to bear\r\nweight on the foot. The leg is flexed as in complete radial paralysis,\r\nor fracture of the ulna. There is abnormal mobility of the bones of the\r\nknee, but crepitation is usually absent.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis._--Healing is hard to effect, as one part of the knee is\r\ndrawn upward by the two flexor muscles which separate it from the lower\r\npart. The callus which forms is largely fibrous, and if the animal is\r\nput to work too quickly this callus is liable to rupture. In favorable\r\ncases healing takes place in two or three months. Many horses during the\r\ntreatment develop founder, with consequent drop sole in the sound leg,\r\nas a result of pressure due to continuous standing.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Place the animal in the slings, bring the pieces of bone\r\ntogether if possible, and try to keep them in place by a tight\r\nplaster-of-Paris dressing about the leg, extending down to the fetlock.\r\nPlace the animal in a roomy box stall well provided with bedding so that\r\nhe can lie down, to prevent founder.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURE OF THE FEMUR.\r\n\r\nThe protection which this bone receives from the large mass of muscles\r\nin which it is enveloped does not suffice to invest it with immunity in\r\nregard to fractures.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--It contributes its share to the list of accidents of this\r\ndescription, sometimes in consequence of external violence and sometimes\r\nas the result of muscular contraction; sometimes it takes place at the\r\nupper extremity of the bone; sometimes at the lower; sometimes at the\r\nhead, when the condyles become implicated; but it is principally found\r\nin the body or diaphysis. The fracture may be of any of the ordinary\r\nforms, simple or compound, complete or incomplete, transverse or\r\noblique, etc. A case of the comminuted variety is recorded in which 85\r\nfragments of bone were counted and removed.\r\n\r\nThe thickness of the muscular covering sometimes renders the diagnosis\r\ndifficult by interfering with the manipulation, but the crepitation test\r\nis readily available, even when the swelling is considerable, and which\r\nis liable to be the case as the result of the interstitial hemorrhage\r\nwhich naturally follows the laceration of the blood vessels of the\r\nregion involved.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--If the fracture is at the neck of the bone the muscles of\r\nthat region (the gluteal) are firmly contracted, and the leg seems to be\r\nshortened in consequence. Locomotion is impossible. There is intense\r\npain and violent sweating at first. Crepitation may in some cases be\r\ndiscerned by rectal examination, with one hand resting over the\r\ncoxo-femoral (hip) articulation. Fractures of the tuberosities of the\r\nupper end of the bone, the great trochanter, may be identified by the\r\ndeformity, the swelling, the impossibility of rotation, and the dragging\r\nof the leg in walking. Fracture of the body is always accompanied with\r\ndisplacement, and as a consequence a shortening of the leg, which is\r\ncarried forward. The lameness is excessive, the foot being moved, both\r\nwhen raising it from the ground and when setting it down, very timidly\r\nand cautiously. The manipulations for the discovery of crepitation\r\nalways cause much pain. Lesions of the lower end of the bone are more\r\ndifficult to diagnosticate with certainty, though the manifestation of\r\npain while making heavy pressure upon the condyles will be so marked\r\nthat only crepitation will be needed to turn a suspicion into a\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The question as to treatment in fractures of this\r\ndescription resolves itself into the query whether any treatment can be\r\nsuggested that will avail anything practically as a curative measure;\r\nwhether, upon the hypothesis of reduction as an accomplished fact, any\r\npermanent or efficient device as a means of retention is within the\r\nscope of human ingenuity. If the reduction were successfully performed,\r\nwould it be possible to keep the parts in place by any known means at\r\nour disposal? At the best the most favorable result that could be\r\nanticipated would be a reunion of the fragments with a considerable\r\nshortening of the bone and a helpless, limping, crippled animal to\r\nremind us that for human achievement there is a \"thus far and no\r\nfarther.\"\r\n\r\nIn small animals, such as dogs and cats, however, attempts at treatment\r\nare justifiable, and we are convinced that in many cases of difficulty\r\nin the application of splints and bandages a patient may be placed in a\r\ncondition of undisturbed quiet and left to the processes of nature for\r\n\"treatment\" as safely and with as good an assurance of a favorable\r\nresult as if he had been subjected to the most heroic secundum artem\r\ndoctoring known to science. As a case in point, mention may be made of\r\nthe case of a pregnant bitch which suffered a fracture of the upper end\r\nof the femur by being run over by a light wagon. Her \"treatment\"\r\nconsisted in being tied up in a large box and let alone. In due time she\r\nwas delivered of a family of puppies, and in three weeks she was running\r\nin the streets, limping very slightly, and nothing the worse for her\r\naccident.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURE OF THE PATELLA.\r\n\r\nThis, fortunately, is a rare accident, and can result only from direct\r\nviolence, as a kick or other blow. The lameness which follows it is\r\naccompanied with enormous tumefaction of the joint, pain, inability to\r\nbear weight upon the foot, and finally disease of the articulation.\r\nCrepitation is absent, because the hip muscles draw away the upper part\r\nof the bone. The prognosis is unavoidably adverse, destruction being the\r\nonly termination of this incurable and very painful injury. Most of the\r\nreported cases of cures are based upon a wrong diagnosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURES OF THE TIBIA.\r\n\r\nOf all fractures these are probably more frequently encountered than any\r\nothers among the class of accidents we are considering. As with injuries\r\nof the forearm of a like character, they may be complete or incomplete;\r\nthe former when the bone is broken in the middle or at the extremities,\r\nand transverse, oblique, or longitudinal. The incomplete kind are more\r\ncommon in this bone than in any other.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Complete fractures are easy to recognize, either with or\r\nwithout displacement. The animal is very lame, and the leg is either\r\ndragged or held clear from the ground by flexion at the stifle, while\r\nthe lower part hangs down. Carrying weight or moving backward is\r\nimpossible. There is excessive mobility below the fracture, and\r\nwell-marked crepitation. If there is much displacement, as in an oblique\r\nfracture, there will be considerable shortening of the leg.\r\n\r\nWhile incomplete fractures can not be recognized in the tibia with any\r\ngreater degree of certainty than in any other bone, there are some facts\r\nassociated with them by which a diagnosis may be justified. The\r\nhypothetical history of a case may serve as an illustration:\r\n\r\nAn animal has received an injury by a blow or a kick on the inside of\r\nthe bone, perhaps without showing any mark. Becoming very lame\r\nimmediately afterwards, he is allowed a few days' rest. If taken out\r\nagain, he seems to have recovered his soundness, but within a day or\r\ntwo he betrays a little soreness, and this increasing he becomes very\r\nlame again, to be furloughed once more, with the result of a temporary\r\nimprovement, and again a return to labor and again a relapse of the\r\nlameness; and this alternation seems to be the rule. The leg being now\r\ncarefully examined, a local periostitis is readily discovered at the\r\npoint of the injury, the part being warm, swollen, and painful. What\r\nfurther proof is necessary? Is it not evident that a fracture has\r\noccurred, first superficial--a mere split in the bony structure, which,\r\nfortunately, has been discovered before some extra exertion or a casual\r\nmisstep had developed it into one of the complete kind, possibly with\r\ncomplications? What other inference can such a series of symptoms thus\r\nrepeated establish?\r\n\r\nThe prognosis of fracture of the tibia, as a rule, must be unfavorable.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The difficulty of obtaining a union without shortening,\r\nand consequently without lameness, is proof of the futility of ordinary\r\nattempts at treatment, but though this may be true in respect to\r\nfractures of the complete kind, it is not necessarily so with the\r\nincomplete variety, and with this class the simple treatment of the\r\nslings is all that is necessary to obtain consolidation. A few weeks of\r\nthis confinement will be sufficient.\r\n\r\nWith dogs and other small animals there are cases which may be\r\nsuccessfully treated. If the necessary dressings can be successfully\r\napplied and retained, a cure will follow.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURES OF THE HOCK.\r\n\r\nInjuries of the astragalus which had a fatal termination have been\r\nrecorded. Fractures of the os calcis have also been observed, but never\r\nwith a favorable prognosis, and attempts to induce recovery, as might\r\nhave been expected, have proved futile.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURES OF THE CANNON BONES.\r\n\r\nWhether these occur in the fore or hind legs, they appear either in the\r\nbody or near their extremities. If in the body as a rule the three\r\nmetacarpal or metatarsal bones are affected, and the fracture is\r\ngenerally transverse and oblique. On account of the absence of soft\r\ntissue and tightness of the skin, the broken bones pierce the skin and\r\nrender the fracture a complicated one. The diagnosis is easy when all\r\nthe bones are completely broken, but the incomplete fracture can be only\r\nsuspected.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--There is no displacement, but excessive mobility,\r\ncrepitation, inability to sustain weight, and the leg is kept off the\r\nground by the flexion of the upper joint.\r\n\r\nNo region of the body affords better facilities for the application of\r\ntreatment, and the prognosis on this account is usually favorable. We\r\nrecall a case, however, which proved fatal, though under exceptional\r\ncircumstances. The patient was a valuable stallion of highly nervous\r\norganization, with a compound fracture of one of the cannon bones, and\r\nhis unconquerable resistance to treatment, excited by the intense pain\r\nof the wound, precluded all chance of recovery, and ultimately caused\r\nhis death.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The general form of treatment for these lesions will not\r\ndiffer from that which has been already indicated for other fractures.\r\nReduction, sometimes necessitating the casting of the patient;\r\ncoaptation, comparatively easy by reason of the subcutaneous situation\r\nof the bone; retention, by means of splints and bandages--applied on\r\nboth sides of the region, and reaching to the ground as in fractures of\r\nthe forearm--these are always indicated. We have obtained excellent\r\nresults by the use of a mold of thick gutta-percha, composed of two\r\nsections and made to surround the entire lower part of the leg as in an\r\ninflexible case.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURE OF THE FIRST PHALANX.\r\n\r\nThe hind extremity is more liable than the fore to this injury. It is\r\nusually the result of a violent effort, or of a sudden misstep or\r\ntwisting of the leg, and may be transverse, or, as has usually been the\r\ncase in our experience, longitudinal, extending from the upper articular\r\nsurface down to the center of the bone, and generally oblique and often\r\ncomminuted. The symptoms are the swelling and tenderness of the region,\r\npossibly crepitation; a certain abnormal mobility; an excessive degree\r\nof lameness, and in some instances a dropping back of the fetlock, with\r\nperhaps a straightened or upright condition of the pastern.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of reduction and coaptation in this accident, and the\r\nprobability of bony deposits, as of ringbones, resulting in lameness,\r\nare circumstances which tend to discourage a favorable prognosis.\r\n\r\nThe treatment is that which has been recommended for all fractures, so\r\nfar as it can be applied. The iron splint which has been mentioned gives\r\nexcellent results in many instances, but if the fracture is incomplete\r\nand without displacement, a form of treatment less energetic and severe\r\nshould be attempted. One case is within our knowledge in which the owner\r\nlost his horse by his refusal to subject the animal to treatment, the\r\npost-mortem revealing only a simple fracture with very slight\r\ndisplacement.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURES OF THE SECOND PHALANX (CORONET).\r\n\r\nThough these are generally of the comminuted kind, there are often\r\nconditions associated with them which justify the surgeon in attempting\r\ntheir treatment. Though crepitation is not always easy to detect, the\r\nexcessive lameness, the soreness on pressure, the inability to carry\r\nweight, the difficulty experienced in raising the foot, all these\r\nsuggest, as the solution of the question of diagnosis, the fracture of\r\nthe coronet, with the accompanying realization of the fact that there is\r\nyet, by reason of the situation of the member, immobilized as it is by\r\nits structure and its surroundings, room left for a not unfavorable\r\nprognosis. Only a slight manipulation will be needed in the treatment of\r\nthis lesion. To render the immobility of the region more fixed, to\r\nsupport the bones in their position by bandaging, and to establish\r\nforced immobility of the entire body with the slings is usually all that\r\nis required. Ringbone, being a common sequela of the reparative process,\r\nmust receive due attention subsequently. One of the severest\r\ncomplications liable to be encountered is an immobile joint\r\n(anchylosis). Neurectomy of the median nerve may relieve lameness after\r\na fracture of the phalanges.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURES OF THE THIRD PHALANX (OS PEDIS).\r\n\r\nThese lesions may result from a penetrating street nail, or follow\r\nplantar or median neurectomy. In the latter instance it is caused by the\r\nanimal setting the foot down carelessly and too violently, and partly\r\ndue to degeneration of bone tissue which follows nerving.\r\n\r\nThough these fractures are not of very rare occurrence, their\r\nrecognition is not easy, and there is more of speculation than of\r\ncertainty pertaining to their diagnosis. The animal is very lame and\r\nspares the injured foot as much as possible, sometimes resting it upon\r\nthe toe alone and sometimes holding it from the ground. The foot is very\r\ntender, and the exploring pinchers of the examining surgeon cause much\r\npain. During the first 24 hours there is no increased pulsation in the\r\ndigital and plantar arteries, but on the second day it is apparent.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to encourage a favorable prognosis, and a not unusual\r\ntermination is an anchylosis with either the navicular bone or the\r\ncoronet.\r\n\r\nNo method of treatment needs to be suggested here, the hoof performing\r\nthe office of retention unaided. Local treatment by baths and\r\nfomentations will do the rest. It may be months before there is any\r\nmitigation of the lameness.\r\n\r\nAn ultimate recovery depends to a great extent upon whether the other\r\nfoot can support the weight during the healing process without causing a\r\ndrop sole in the supporting foot.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURE OF THE SESAMOID BONES.\r\n\r\nThis lesion has been considered by veterinarians, erroneously, we think,\r\nas one of rare occurrence. We believe it to be more frequent than has\r\nbeen supposed. Many observations and careful dissections have convinced\r\nus that fractures of these little bones have been often mistaken for\r\nspecific lesions of the numerous ligaments that are implanted upon their\r\nsuperior and inferior parts, and which have been described as a \"giving\r\nway\" or \"breaking down\" of these ligaments. In my post-mortem\r\nexaminations I have always noted the fact that when the attachments of\r\nthe ligaments were torn from their bony connections minute fragments of\r\nbony structure were also separated, though we have failed to detect any\r\ndiseased process of the fibrous tissue composing the ligamentous\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--From whatever cause this lesion may arise, it can hardly be\r\nconsidered as of a traumatic nature, no external violence having any\r\napparent agency in producing it, and it is our belief that it is due to\r\na peculiar degeneration or softening of the bones themselves, a theory\r\nwhich acquires plausibility from the consideration of the spongy\r\nconsistency of the sesamoids. The disease is a peculiar one, and the\r\nsuddenness with which different feet are successively attacked, at short\r\nintervals and without any obvious cause, seems to prove the existence of\r\nsome latent, morbid cause which has been unsuspectedly incubating. It is\r\nnot peculiar to any particular class of horses, nor to any special\r\nseason of the year, having fallen under our observation in each of the\r\nfour seasons.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The general fact is reported in the history of most cases\r\nthat it makes its appearance without premonition in animals which, after\r\nenjoying a considerable period of rest, are first exercised or put to\r\nwork, though in point of fact it may manifest itself while the horse is\r\nstill idle in his stable. A hypothetical case, in illustration, will\r\nexplain our theory: An animal which has been at rest in his stable is\r\ntaken out to work, and it will be presently noticed that there is\r\nsomething unusual in his movement. His gait is changed, and he travels\r\nwith short, mincing steps, without any of his accustomed ease and\r\nfreedom. This may continue until his return to the stable, and then,\r\nafter being placed in his stall, he will be noticed shifting his weight\r\nfrom side to side and from one leg to another, continuing the movement\r\nuntil rupture of the bony structure takes place. But it may happen that\r\nthe lameness in one or more of the extremities, anterior or posterior,\r\nsuddenly increases, and it becomes evident that the rupture has taken\r\nplace in consequence of a misstep or a stumble while the horse is at\r\nwork. Then, upon coming to a standstill, he will be found with one or\r\nmore of his toes turned up; he is unable to place the affected foot flat\r\non the ground. The fetlock has dropped and the leg rests upon this part,\r\nthe skin of which may have remained intact or may have been more or less\r\nextensively lacerated. It seldom happens that more than one toe at a\r\ntime will turn up, yet still the lesion in one will be followed by its\r\noccurrence in another. Commonly two feet, either the anterior or\r\nposterior, are affected, and we recall one case in which the two fore\r\nand one of the hind legs were included at the same time. The accident,\r\nhowever, is quite as liable to happen while the horse is at rest in his\r\nstall, and he may be found in the morning standing on his fetlocks. One\r\nof the earliest of the cases occurring in my own experience had been\r\nunder care for several weeks for suspected disease of the fetlocks, the\r\nnature of which had not been made out, when, apparently improved by the\r\ntreatment which he had undergone, the patient was taken out of the\r\nstable to be walked a short distance into the country, but had little\r\nmore than started when he was called to a halt by the fracture of the\r\nsesamoids of both fore legs.\r\n\r\nWhile there are no positive premonitory symptoms of these fractures\r\nknown, we believe that there are signs and symptoms which come but\r\nlittle short of being so, and the appearance of which will always\r\njustify a strong suspicion of the truth of the case. These have been\r\nindicated when referring to the soreness in standing, the short, mincing\r\ngait, and the tenderness betrayed when pressure is made over the\r\nsesamoids on the sides of the fetlock, with others less tangible and\r\ndefinable.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis._--These injuries can never be accounted less than serious,\r\nand in our judgment will never be other than fatal. If our theory of\r\ntheir pathology is the correct one, and the cause of the lesions is\r\ntruly the softening of the sesamoidal bony structure and independent of\r\nany changes in the ligamentous fibers, the possibility of a solid\r\nosseous union can hardly be considered admissible.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In respect to the treatment to be recommended and\r\ninstituted it can be employed only with any rational hope of benefit\r\nduring the incubation, and with the anticipatory purpose of prevention.\r\nIt must be suggested by a suspicion of the verities of the case, and\r\napplied before any rupture has taken place. To prevent this and to\r\nantagonize the causes which might precipitate the final catastrophe--the\r\nelevation of the toes--resort must be had to the slings and to the\r\napplication of firm bandages or splints, perhaps of plaster of Paris,\r\nwith a high shoe, as about the only indications which science and nature\r\nare able to offer. When the fracture is an occurred event, and the toes,\r\none or more, are turned up, any further resort to treatment will be\r\nfutile.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF JOINTS.\r\n\r\nThree classes of injury will be considered under this head. These are,\r\naffections of the synovial sacs, those of the joint structures, or of\r\nthe bones and their articular surfaces, and those forms of solution of\r\ncontinuity known as dislocations or luxations.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE SYNOVIAL SACS.\r\n\r\nTwo forms of affection here present themselves, one being the result of\r\nan abnormal secretion which induces a dropsical condition of the sac\r\nwithout any acute, inflammatory action, while the other is characterized\r\nby excessive inflammatory symptoms, with their modifications,\r\nconstituting synovitis.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNOVIAL DROPSIES.\r\n\r\nWe have already considered in a general way the presence of these\r\npeculiar oil bags in the joints, and in some regions of the legs where\r\nthe passage of the tendons takes place, and have noticed the similarity\r\nof structure and function of both the articular and the tendinous bursae,\r\nas well as the etiology of their injuries and their pathological\r\nhistory, and we will now treat of the affections of both.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINDGALLS.\r\n\r\nThis name is given to the dilated bursae found at the posterior part of\r\nthe fetlock joint. They have their origin in a dropsical condition of\r\nthe bursae of the joint itself, also of the tendon which slides behind\r\nit, and are therefore further known by the designations of articular and\r\ntendinous windgalls, or puffs. (See also p. 401.)\r\n\r\nThey appear in the form of soft and somewhat symmetrical tumors, of\r\nvarying dimensions, and generally well defined in their circumference.\r\nThey are more or less tense, according to the quantity of secretion they\r\ncontain, apparently becoming softer as the foot is raised and the\r\nfetlock flexed. Usually they are painless and only cause lameness under\r\ncertain conditions, as when they begin to develop themselves under the\r\nstimulus of inflammatory action, or when large enough to interfere with\r\nthe functions of the tendons, or again when they have undergone certain\r\npathological changes, such as calcification, which is among their\r\ntendencies.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--Windgalls may be attributed to external causes, such as severe\r\nlabor or strains resulting from heavy pulling, fast driving, or jumping,\r\nor they may be among the sequelae of internal disorders, such as\r\nstrangles or the resultants of a pleuritic or pneumonic attack.\r\n\r\nUnnecessary anxiety is sometimes experienced respecting these growths,\r\nwith much questioning touching the expediency of their removal, all of\r\nwhich might be spared, for, while they constitute a blemish, their\r\nunsightliness will not hinder the usefulness of the animal, and in any\r\ncase they rarely fail to show themselves easily amenable to treatment.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--When in their acute stage, and when the dropsical\r\ncondition is not excessive, the inflammation may be checked during the\r\nday by continuous, cold-water irrigation by means of a hose or soaking\r\ntub and at night by applying a moderately tight-roller bandage. Later\r\nabsorption may be promoted by a Priessnitz bandage,[2] pressure by\r\nroller bandages, sweating, the use of liniments, or if necessary by a\r\nsharp blister of biniodid of mercury. This treatment should subdue the\r\ninflammation, abate the soreness, absorb the excess of secretion,\r\nstrengthen the walls of the sac, and finally cause the windgalls to\r\ndisappear, provided the animal is not too quickly returned to labor and\r\nexposed to the same factors that occasioned them at first.\r\n\r\nIf the inflammation has become chronic, however, and the enlargement has\r\nbeen of considerable duration, the negative course will be the wiser\r\none. If any benefit results from treatment it will be of only a\r\ntransient kind, the dilatation returning when the patient is again\r\nsubjected to labor, and it will be a fortunate circumstance if\r\ninflammation has not supervened.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the generally benignant nature of the swelling there are\r\nexceptional cases, usually when it is probably undergoing certain\r\npathological changes, which may result in lameness and disable the\r\nanimal, in which case surgical treatment will be indicated, especially\r\nif repeated blisters have failed to improve the symptoms. Line firing is\r\nthen a preeminent suggestion, and many a useful life has received a new\r\nlease as the result of this operation timely performed. Another method\r\nof firing, which consists in emptying the sac by means of punctures\r\nthrough and through, made with a red-hot needle or wire, and the\r\nsubsequent injection of certain irritating and alterative compounds into\r\nthe cavity, designed to effect its closure by exciting adhesive\r\ninflammation, such as tincture of iodin, may be commended. But they are\r\nall too active and energetic in their effects and require too much\r\nspecial attention and intelligent management to be trusted to any hands\r\nother than those of an expert veterinarian.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOOD SPAVIN, BOG SPAVIN, AND THOROUGHPIN.\r\n\r\nThe blood spavin is situated in front and to the inside of the hock and\r\nis merely a varicose or dilated condition of the saphena vein. It occurs\r\ndirectly over the point where the bog spavin is found, and has thus been\r\nfrequently confused with the latter.\r\n\r\nThe complicated arrangement of the hock joint, and the powerful tendons\r\nwhich pass on the posterior part, are lubricated with the product of\r\nsecretion from one tendinous synovial and several articular synovial\r\nsacs. A large articular sac contributes to the lubrication of the shank\r\nbone (the tibia) and one of the bones of the hock (the astragalus). The\r\ntendinous sac lies back of the articulation itself and extends upward\r\nand downward in the groove of that joint through which the flexor\r\ntendons slide. The dilatation of this articular synovial sac is what is\r\ndenominated bog spavin, the term thoroughpin being applied to the\r\ndilatation of the tendinous capsule.\r\n\r\nThe bog spavin is a round, smooth, well-defined, fluctuating tumor\r\nsituated in front and a little inward of the hock. On pressure it\r\ndisappears at this point to reappear on the outside and just behind the\r\nhock. If pressed to the front from the outside it will then appear on\r\nthe inside of the hock. On its outer surface it presents a vein which is\r\nquite prominent, running from below upward, and it is to the\r\npreternatural dilatation of this blood vessel that the term blood spavin\r\nis applied.\r\n\r\nThe thoroughpin is found at the back and on the top of the hock in that\r\npart known as the \"hollows,\" immediately behind the shank bone. It is\r\nround and smooth, but not so regularly formed as the bog spavin, and is\r\nmost apparent when viewed from behind. The swelling is usually on both\r\nsides and a little in front of the so-called hamstring, but may be more\r\nnoticeable on the inside or on the outside.\r\n\r\nIn their general characteristics bog spavins and thoroughpins are\r\nsimilar to windgalls, and one description of the origin, symptoms,\r\npathological changes, and treatment will serve for all equally, except\r\nthat it is possible for a bog spavin to cause lameness, and thus to\r\ninvolve a verdict of unsoundness in the patient, a circumstance which\r\nwill, of course, justify its classification by itself as a severer form\r\nof a single type of disease.\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to the subject of treatment and the means\r\nemployed--rest, of course--with liniments, blisters, etc., and what we\r\nesteem as the most active and beneficial of any, early, deep, and\r\nwell-performed cauterization. There are, besides, commendatory reports\r\nof a form of treatment by the application of pressure pads and peculiar\r\nbandages upon the hocks, and it is asserted that the removal of the\r\ntumors has been effected by their use. Our experience with this\r\napparatus, however, has not been accompanied with such favorable results\r\nas would justify our indorsement of the flattering representations which\r\nhave sometimes appeared in its behalf.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPEN JOINTS, BROKEN KNEES, SYNOVITIS, AND ARTHRITIS.\r\n\r\nThe close relationship which exists among these several affections,\r\ntheir apparently possible connection as successive developments of a\r\nsimilar, if not an essentially identical, origin, together with the\r\nadvantage gained by avoiding frequent repetitions in the details of\r\nsymptoms, treatment, etc., are our reasons for treating under a single\r\nhead the ailments we have grouped together in the present section.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--The great, comprehensive, common cause of, sometimes\r\npermanent, sometimes only transient, disability of the horse is external\r\ntraumatism.\r\n\r\nBlows, bruises, hurts by nearly every known form of violence, falls,\r\nkicks, lacerations, punctures--we may add compulsory speed in racing and\r\ncruel overloading of draft animals--cover the entire ground of causation\r\nof the diseases and injuries of the joints now receiving our\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nIn one case, a working horse making a misstep stumbles, and falling on\r\nhis knees receives a hurt, variously severe, from a mere abrasion of the\r\nskin to a laceration, a division of the tegument, a slough,\r\nmortification, and the escape of the synovial fluid, with or without\r\nexposure of the bones and their articular cartilages.\r\n\r\nIn another case, an animal, from one cause or another, perhaps an\r\nimpatient temper, has formed the habit of striking or pawing his manger\r\nwith his fore feet until inflammation of the knee joint is induced,\r\nfirst as a little swelling, diffused, painless; then as a periostitis of\r\nthe bones of the knee; later as bony deposits, then lameness, and\r\nfinally the implication of the joint, with all the various sequelae of\r\nchronic inflammation of the knee joint.\r\n\r\nIn another case, a horse has received a blow with a fork from a careless\r\nhostler on or near a joint, or has been kicked by a stable companion,\r\nwith the result of a punctured wound, at first mild-looking, painless,\r\napparently without inflammation, and not yet causing lameness, but\r\nwhich, in a few hours, or it may be only after a few days, becomes\r\nexcessively painful, grows worse, the entire joint swells, presently\r\ndischarges, and at last a case of suppurative synovitis is presented,\r\nwith perhaps disease of the joint proper, and arthritis as a climax. The\r\nsymptoms of articular injuries vary not only in the degrees of the hurt\r\nbut in the nature of the lesion.\r\n\r\nOr the condition of broken knees, resulting as we have said, may have\r\nfor its starting point a mere abrasion of the skin--a scratch,\r\napparently, which disappears without a scar. The injury may, however,\r\nhave been more severe, the blow heavier, the fall aggravated by\r\noccurring upon an irregular surface, or sharp or rough object, with\r\ntearing or cutting of the skin, and this laceration may remain. A more\r\nserious case than the first is now brought to our notice.\r\n\r\nAnother time, immediately following the accident, or possibly as a\r\nsequel of the traumatism, the tendinous sacs may be opened, with the\r\nescape of the synovia, or, worse, the tendons which pass in front of the\r\nknee are torn, the inflammation spreads, the joint and leg are swollen,\r\nthe animal is becoming very lame; synovitis has set in. With this the\r\ndanger becomes very great, for soon suppuration will be established,\r\nthen the external coat of the articulation proper becomes ulcerated, if\r\nit is not already in that state, and we find ourselves in the presence\r\nof an open joint with suppurative synovitis--that is, with the worst\r\namong the conditions of diseased processes, because of the liability of\r\nthe suppuration to become infiltrated into every part of the joint,\r\nmacerating the ligaments and irritating the cartilages, soon to be\r\nsucceeded by their ulceration, with the destruction of the articular\r\nsurface--or the lesion of ulcerative arthritis, one of the gravest among\r\nall the disorders known to the animal economy.\r\n\r\nUlcerative arthritis and suppurative synovitis may be developed\r\notherwise than in connection with open joints; the simplest and\r\napparently most harmless punctures may prove to be sufficient cause. For\r\nexample, a horse may be kicked, perhaps, on the inside of the hock;\r\nthere is a mark and a few drops of blood to indicate the spot; he is put\r\nto work apparently free from pain or lameness and performs his task with\r\nhis usual ease and facility. On the following morning, however, the hock\r\nis found to be a little swollen and there is some stiffness. A little\r\nlater on he betrays a degree of uneasiness in the leg, and shrinks from\r\nresting his weight upon it, moving it up and down for relief. The\r\nswelling has increased and is increasing; the pain is severe; and\r\nfinally, at the spot where the kick inpinged, there is an oozing of an\r\noily liquid mixed with whitish drops of suppuration. The mischief is\r\ndone; a simple, harmless, punctured wound has expanded into a case of\r\nulcerative arthritis and suppurative synovitis.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis._--From ever so brief and succinct description of this\r\ntraumatism of the articulations, the serious and important character of\r\nthese lesions, irrespective of which particular joint is affected, will\r\nbe readily understood. Yet there will be modifications in the prognosis\r\nin different cases, in accordance with the peculiarities of structure in\r\nthe joint specially involved, as, for example, it is obvious that a\r\nbetter result may be expected from treatment when but a single joint,\r\nwith only its plain articular surfaces, is the place of injury, than in\r\none which is composed of several bones, united in a complex formation,\r\nas in the knee or hock. As severe a lesion as suppurative synovitis\r\nalways is, and as frequently fatal as it proves to be, still cases arise\r\nin which, the inflammation assuming a modified character and at length\r\nsubsiding, the lesion terminates favorably and leaves the animal with a\r\ncomparatively sound and useful joint. There are cases, however, which\r\nterminate in no more favorable a result than the union of the bones and\r\nocclusion of the joint, to form an anchylosis, which is scarcely a\r\ncondition to justify a high degree of satisfaction, as it insures a\r\npermanent lameness with very little capacity for usefulness.\r\n\r\nAppreciating now the dangers associated with all wounds of\r\narticulations, however simple and apparently slight, and how serious and\r\ntroublesome are the complications which are liable to arise during their\r\nprogress and treatment, we are prepared to understand and realize the\r\nnecessity and the value of early and prompt attention upon their\r\ndiscovery and diagnosis.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--For simple bruises, like those which appear in the form of\r\nbroken knees or of carpitis, simple remedies, such as warm fomentations\r\nor cold-water applications and compresses of astringent mixtures,\r\nsuggest themselves at once. Injuries of a more complicated character, as\r\nlacerations of the skin or tearing of soft structures, will also be\r\nbenefited by simple dressings with antiseptic mixtures, as those of the\r\ncarbolic-acid order. The escape of synovia should suggest the prompt use\r\nof collodion dressings to check the flow and prevent the further escape\r\nof the fluid. But if the discharge is abundant and heavily suppurative,\r\nlittle can be done more than to put in practice the \"expectant\" method\r\nwith warm fomentations, repeatedly applied, and soothing, mucilaginous\r\npoultices. Improvement, if any is possible, will be but slow to manifest\r\nitself. The most difficult of all things to do, in view of varying\r\ninterests and opinions--that is, in a practical sense--is to abstain\r\nfrom \"doing\" entirely, and yet in the cases we are considering we are\r\nfirmly convinced that noninterference is the best and wisest policy.\r\n\r\nIn cases which are carried to a successful result the discharge will\r\ndiminish by degrees, the extreme pain will gradually subside, the\r\nconvalescent will begin timidly to rest his foot upon the ground, and\r\npresently to bear weight upon it, and perhaps, after a long and tedious\r\nprocess of recuperation, he may be returned to his former and normal\r\ncondition of usefulness. When the discharge has wholly ceased and the\r\nwounds are entirely healed, a blister covering the whole of the joint\r\nfor the purpose of stimulating the absorption of the exudation will be\r\nof great service. If, on the contrary, there is no amelioration of\r\nsymptoms and the progress of the disease resists every attempt to check\r\nit; if the discharge continues to flow not only without abatement but in\r\nan increased volume, and not alone by a single opening but by a number\r\nof fistulous tracts which have successively formed; if it seems evident\r\nthat this drainage is rapidly and painfully sapping the suffering\r\nanimal's vitality, and a deficient _vis vitae_ fails to cooperate with\r\nthe means of cure--all rational hope of recovery may be finally\r\nabandoned. Any further waiting for chances, or time lost in\r\nexperimenting, will be mere cruelty and there need be no hesitation\r\nconcerning the next step. The poor beast is under sentence of death, and\r\nevery consideration of interest and of humanity demands an anticipation\r\nof nature's evident intent in the quick and easy execution of the\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXX.\r\n\r\nDISLOCATION OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW\r\n\r\nBourgelat's apparatus]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXI.\r\n\r\nTHE SLING IN USE]\r\n\r\nOne of the essentials of treatment, and probably an indispensable\r\ncondition when recovery is in any wise attainable, is the suspension of\r\nthe patient in slings. He should be continued in them so long as he can\r\nbe made to submit quietly to their restraint.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISLOCATIONS.\r\n\r\nDislocations and luxations are interchangeable terms, meaning the\r\nseparation and displacement of the articulating surfaces of the bones\r\nentering into the formation of a joint. This injury is rarely\r\nencountered in our large animals on account of the combination of\r\nstrength and solidity in the formation of their joints. It is met with\r\nbut seldom in cattle and less so in horses, while dogs and smaller\r\nanimals are more often the sufferers.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--The accident of a luxation is less often encountered in the\r\nanimal races than in man. This is not because the former are less\r\nsubject to occasional violence involving powerful muscular contractions,\r\nor are less often exposed to casualties similar to those which result\r\nin luxations in the human skeleton, but because it requires the\r\ncooperation of conditions--anatomical, physiological, and perhaps\r\nmechanical--present in the human race and lacking in the others, which,\r\nhowever, can not in every case be clearly defined. Perhaps the greater\r\nrelative length of the bony levers in the human formation may constitute\r\na cause of the difference.\r\n\r\nAmong the predisposing causes in animals may be enumerated caries of\r\narticular surfaces, articular abscesses, excessive dropsical conditions,\r\ndegenerative softening of the ligaments, and any excessive laxity of the\r\nsoft structures.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms and diagnosis._--Three signs of dislocation must usually be\r\ntaken into consideration. They are: (1) An alteration in the shape of\r\nthe joint and in the normal relationship of the articulating surfaces;\r\n(2) an alteration in the length of the limb, either shortening or\r\nlengthening; (3) an alteration in the movableness of the joint, usually\r\nan unnatural immobility. Only the first, however, can be relied upon as\r\nessential. Luxations are not always complete; they may be partial; that\r\nis, the articulating surfaces may be displaced but not separated. In\r\nsuch cases several symptoms may not be present. And not only may the\r\nthird sign be absent, but the mobility of the first be greatly increased\r\nwhen the character of the injury has been such as to produce extensive\r\nlacerations of the articular ligaments.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above signs, a luxation is usually characterized by\r\npain, swelling, hemorrhage beneath the skin from damaged or ruptured\r\nblood vessels, and even paralysis, when important nerves are pressed on\r\nby the displaced bones.\r\n\r\nSometimes a bone is fractured in the immediate vicinity of a joint. The\r\nknowledge of this fact requires us to be able to diagnose between a\r\ndislocation and such a fracture. In this we generally have three points\r\nto assist us: (1) The immobility of a dislocated joint as against the\r\napparently remarkable freedom of movement in fracture; (2) in a\r\ndislocation there is no true crepitus--that peculiar grating sensation\r\nheard as well as felt on rubbing together the rough ends of fractured\r\nbones; however, it must be remembered that in a dislocation two or three\r\ndays old the inflammatory changes around the joint may give rise to a\r\ncrackling sensation similar to that in fracture; (3) as a rule, in\r\nluxations, if the ligamentous and muscular tissues about the joint are\r\nnot badly torn, the displacement, when reduced, does not recur.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis._--The prognosis of a luxation is comparatively less serious\r\nthan that of a fracture, though at time the indications of treatment may\r\nprove to be so difficult to apply that complications of a very severe\r\ncharacter may arise.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment of luxations must, of course, be similar to\r\nthat of fractures. Reduction, naturally, will be the first indication in\r\nboth cases, and the retention of the replaced parts must follow. The\r\nreduction involves the same steps of extension and counter extension,\r\nperformed in the same manner, with the patient subdued by anesthetics.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the reduction of a dislocation and that of a\r\nfracture consists in the fact that in the former the object is simply to\r\nrestore the bones to their true, normal position, with each articular\r\nsurface in exact contact with its companion surface, the apparatus\r\nnecessary afterwards to keep them in situ being similar to that which is\r\nemployed in fracture cases, and which will usually require to be\r\nretained for a period of from 40 to 50 days, if not longer, before the\r\nruptured retaining ligaments are sufficiently firm to be trusted to\r\nperform their office unassisted. A variety of manipulations are to be\r\nused by the surgeon, consisting in pushing, pulling, pressing, rotating,\r\nand, indeed, whatever movement may be necessary, until the bones are\r\nforced into such relative positions that the muscular contraction,\r\noperating in just the right directions, pulls the opposite matched ends\r\ntogether in true coaptation--a head into a cavity, an articular eminence\r\ninto a trochlea, as the case may be. The \"setting\" is accompanied with a\r\npeculiar, snapping sound, audible and significant, as well as a visible\r\nreturn of the surface to its normal symmetry.\r\n\r\n_Special dislocations._--While all the articulations of the body are\r\nliable to this form of injury, there are three in the large animals\r\nwhich may claim a special consideration, viz:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHOULDER JOINT.\r\n\r\nWe mention this displacement without intending to imply the\r\npracticability of any ordinary attempt at treatment, which is usually\r\nunsuccessful, the animal whose mishap it has been to become a victim to\r\nit being disabled for life. The superior head of the arm bone as it is\r\nreceived into the lower cavity of the shoulder blade is so situated as\r\nto be liable to be forced out of place in four directions. It may escape\r\nfrom its socket, according to the manner in which the violence affects\r\nit--outward, inward, backward, or forward--and the deformity which\r\nresults and the effects which follow will correspondingly differ. We\r\nhave said that treatment is generally unsuccessful. It may be added that\r\nthe difficulties which interpose in the way of reduction are nearly\r\ninsurmountable, and that the application of means for the retention of\r\nthe parts after reduction would be next to impossible. The prognosis,\r\nfrom any point of view, is sufficiently grave for the luckless animal\r\nwith a dislocated shoulder.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HIP JOINT.\r\n\r\nThis joint partakes very much of the characteristics of the\r\nhumero-scapular articulation, but is more strongly built. The head of\r\nthe thigh bone is more separated, or prominent and rounder in form, and\r\nthe cup-like cavity, or socket, into which it fits is much deeper,\r\nforming together a deep, true ball-and-socket joint, which is, moreover,\r\nreenforced by two strong cords of funicular ligaments, which unite them.\r\nIt will be easily comprehended, from this hint of the anatomy of the\r\nregion, that a luxation of the hip joint must be an accident of\r\ncomparatively rare occurrence; yet cases are recorded in which the head\r\nof the bone has been affirmed to slip out of its cavity and assume\r\nvarious positions--inward, outward, forward, or backward.\r\n\r\nThe indications of treatment are those of all cases of dislocation. When\r\nthe reduction is accomplished the surgeon will be apprised of the fact\r\nby the peculiar, snapping sound usually heard on such occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\nPSEUDO-LUXATIONS OF THE PATELLA.\r\n\r\nThis is not a true dislocation. The stifle bone is so peculiarly\r\narticulated with the thigh bone that the means of union are of\r\nsufficient strength to resist the causes which usually give rise to\r\nluxations, yet there is sometimes discovered a peculiar, pathological\r\nstate in the hind legs of animals, the effect of which is closely to\r\nsimulate the manifestation of many of the general symptoms of\r\ndislocations. This condition originates in muscular cramps, the action\r\nof which is seen in a certain change in the coaptation of the articular\r\nsurfaces of the stifle and thigh bone, resulting in the exhibition of a\r\nsudden and alarming series of symptoms which have suggested the phrase\r\nof \"stifle out\" as a descriptive term.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The animal so affected stands quietly and firmly in his\r\nstall, or perhaps with one of his hind legs extended backward, and\r\nresists every attempt to move him backward. If urged to move forward he\r\nwill either refuse or comply with a jump, with the toe of the disabled\r\nleg dragging on the ground and brought forward by a second effort. There\r\nis no flexion at the hock and no motion at the stifle, while the\r\ncircular motion of the hip is quite free. The leg appears to be much\r\nlonger than the other, owing to the straightened position of the thigh\r\nbone, which forms almost a straight line with the tibia from the hip\r\njoint down. The stifle joint is motionless, and the motions of all the\r\njoints below it are more or less interfered with. External examination\r\nof the muscles of the hip and thigh reveals a certain degree of\r\nrigidity, with perhaps some soreness, and the stifle bone may be seen\r\nprojecting more or less on the outside and upper part of the joint.\r\n\r\nThis state of things may continue for some time and until treatment is\r\napplied, or it may spontaneously and suddenly terminate, leaving\r\neverything in its normal condition, but perhaps to return again.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--Pseudo-dislocation of the patella is liable to occur under\r\nmany of the conditions which cause actual dislocation, and yet it may\r\noften occur in animals which have not been exposed to the ordinary\r\ncauses, but which have remained at rest in their stables. Sometimes\r\nthese cases are assignable to falls in a slippery stall, or perhaps\r\nslipping when endeavoring to rise; sometimes to weakness in convalescing\r\npatients; sometimes to lack of tonicity of structure and general\r\ndebility; sometimes to relaxation of tissues from want of exercise or\r\nuse. A straight leg, sloping croup, and the young are predisposed to\r\nthis dislocation.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The reduction of these displacements of the patella is not\r\nusually attended with difficulty. A sudden jerk or spasmodic action will\r\noften be all that is required to spring the patella into place, when the\r\nflexion of the leg at the hock ends the trouble for the time. But this\r\nis not always sufficient, and a true reduction may still be indicated.\r\nTo effect this the leg must be drawn well forward by a rope attached to\r\nthe lower end, and the patella, grasped with the hand, forcibly pushed\r\nforward and inward and made to slip over the outside border of the\r\ntrochlea of the femur. The bone suddenly slips into position, the\r\nexcessive rigor of the leg ceases with a spasmodic jerk, and the animal\r\nmay walk or trot away without suspicion of lameness. Though this may end\r\nthe trouble for the time, and the restoration seem to be perfect and\r\npermanent, a repetition of the entire transaction may subsequently take\r\nplace, and perhaps from the loss of some proportion of tensile power\r\nwhich would naturally follow the original attack in the muscles involved\r\nthe lesion might become a habitual weakness.\r\n\r\nWarm fomentations and douches with cold water will often promote\r\npermanent recovery, and liberty in a box stall or in the field will in\r\nmany cases insure constant relief. The use of a high-heeled shoe is\r\nrecommended by European veterinarians. The use of stimulating liniments,\r\nwith frictions, charges, or even severe blisters, may be resorted to in\r\norder to prevent the repetition of the difficulty by strengthening and\r\ntoning up the parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF MUSCLES AND TENDONS.\r\n\r\nSPRAINS.\r\n\r\nThis term expresses a more or less complete laceration or yielding of\r\nthe fibers of the muscles, tendons, or the sheaths surrounding and\r\nsupporting them. The usual cause of a sprain is external violence, such\r\nas a fall or a powerful exertion of strength, with following symptoms of\r\nsoreness, heat, swelling, and a suspension of function. Their\r\ntermination varies from simple resolution to suppuration, and commonly\r\nfibrinous exudation difficult to remove. None of the muscles or tendons\r\nof the body are exempt from liability to this lesion, though naturally\r\nfrom their uses and the exposure of their situation the extremities are\r\nmore liable than other regions to become their seat. The nature of the\r\nprognosis will be determined by a consideration of the seat of the\r\ninjury and the complications likely to arise.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment will resolve itself into the routine of\r\nlocal applications, including warm fomentations, stimulating liniments,\r\ncounterirritation by blistering, and in some cases even firing. Rest, in\r\nthe stable or in a box stall, will be of advantage by promoting the\r\nabsorption of whatever fibrinous exudation may have formed, or\r\nabsorption may be stimulated by the careful persevering application of\r\niodin in the form of ointments of various degrees of strength.\r\n\r\nThere are many conditions in which not only the muscular and tendinous\r\nstructures proper are affected by a strain, but, by contiguity of parts,\r\nthe periosteum of neighboring bones may become involved, with a\r\ncomplication of periostitis and its sequelae.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAMENESS OF THE SHOULDER.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of the occurrence of lameness in the shoulder from sprains\r\nentitles it to precedence of mention in the present category, for,\r\nthough so well covered with its muscular envelope, it is often the seat\r\nof injuries which, from the complex structure of the region, become\r\ndifficult to diagnosticate with satisfactory precision and facility. The\r\nflat bone which forms the skeleton of that region is articulated in a\r\ncomparatively loose manner with the bone of the arm, but the joint is,\r\nnotwithstanding, rather solid, and is powerfully strengthened by tendons\r\npassing outside, inside, and in front of it. Still, shoulder lameness or\r\nsprain may exist, originating in lacerations of the muscles, the tendons\r\nor the ligaments of the joint, or perhaps in diseases of the bones\r\nthemselves. \"Slip of the shoulder\" is a phrase frequently applied to\r\nsuch lesions.\r\n\r\nThe identification of the particular structures involved in these\r\nlesions is of much importance, in view of its bearing upon the question\r\nof prognosis. For example, while a simple superficial injury of the\r\nspinatus muscles, or the muscles by which the leg is attached to the\r\ntrunk, may not be of serious import and may readily yield to treatment,\r\nor even recover spontaneously and without interference, the condition is\r\nquite changed in a case of tearing of the flexor brachii, or of its\r\ntendons as they pass in front of the articulation, or, what is still\r\nmore serious, if there is inflammation or ulceration in the groove over\r\nwhich this tendon slides, or upon the articular surfaces or their\r\nsurroundings, or periostitis at any point adjacent.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--The frequency of attacks of shoulder lameness is not\r\ndifficult to account for. The superficial and unprotected position of\r\nthe part and the numerous movements of which it is capable, and which,\r\nin fact, it performs, render it both subjectively and objectively\r\npreeminently liable to accident or injury. It would be difficult and\r\nwould not materially avail to enumerate all the forms of violence by\r\nwhich the shoulder may be crippled. A fall, accompanied with powerful\r\nconcussion; a violent muscular contraction in starting a heavily loaded\r\nvehicle from a standstill; a misstep following a quick muscular effort;\r\na jump accompanied with miscalculated results in alighting; a slip on a\r\nsmooth, icy road; balling the feet with snow; colliding with another\r\nhorse or other object--indeed, the list may be indefinitely extended,\r\nbut without profit or utility.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Some of the symptoms of shoulder lameness are peculiar to\r\nthemselves, and yet the trouble is frequently mistaken for other\r\naffections--navicular disease more often than any other. The fact that\r\nin both affections there are instances when the external symptoms are\r\nbut imperfectly defined, and that one of them especially is very similar\r\nin both, is sufficient to mislead careless or inexperienced observers\r\nand to occasion the error which is sometimes committed of applying to\r\none disease the name of the other, erring both ways in the interchange.\r\nThe true designation of pathological lesions is very far at times from\r\nbeing of certain and easy accomplishment, and, owing to the massive\r\nstructure of the parts we are considering, this is especially true in\r\nthe present connection. Still there are many cases in which there is\r\nreally no reasonable excuse for an error in diagnosis by an average\r\npractitioner.\r\n\r\nShoulder lameness will, of course, manifest itself by signs and\r\nappearances more or less distinct and pronounced, according to the\r\nnature of the degrees and the extent of the originating cause. We\r\nsummarize some of these signs and appearances:\r\n\r\nThe lameness is not intermittent, but continued, the disturbance of\r\nmotion gaging the severity of the lesion and its extent. It is more\r\nmarked when the bones are diseased than when the muscles alone are\r\naffected. When in motion the two upper bony levers--the shoulder blade\r\nand the bone of the upper arm--are reduced to nearly complete immobility\r\nand the walking is performed by the complete displacement of the entire\r\nmass, which is dragged forward without either flexion of extension. The\r\naction of the joint below, as a natural consequence, is limited in its\r\nflexion. In many instances there is a certain degree of swelling at the\r\npoint of injury--at the joint, or, more commonly, in front of it, or on\r\nthe surface of the spinatus muscle. Again, instead of swelling there\r\nwill be muscular atrophy, though, while this condition of loss of\r\nmuscular power may interfere with perfect locomotion, it is not in\r\nitself usually a cause of shoulder lameness. \"Sweenied\" shoulders are\r\nmore often due to disease below the fetlock than to affections above the\r\nelbow.\r\n\r\nDuring rest the animal often carries his leg forward, somewhat analogous\r\nto the \"pointing\" position of navicular disease, though in some cases\r\nthe painful member drops at the elbow in a semiflexed position. The\r\nbacking is sometimes typical, the animal when performing it, instead of\r\nflexing his shoulder, dragging the whole leg without motion in the upper\r\nsegment of the extremity.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar manner in which the leg is brought forward in the air for\r\nanother step in the act of walking or trotting is in some instances\r\ncharacteristic of injuries of the shoulder. The lameness also manifests\r\nitself in bringing the leg forward with a circumflex swinging motion and\r\na shortening in the extension of the step. The foot is carried close to\r\nthe ground and stumbling is frequent, especially on an uneven road.\r\n\r\nWith the utmost scrutiny and care the vagueness and uncertainty of the\r\nsymptoms will contribute to perplex and discredit the diagnosis and\r\nembarrass the surgeon, and sometimes the expedient is tried of\r\naggravating the symptoms by way of intensifying their significance, and\r\nthus rendering them more intelligible. This has been sought by requiring\r\nthe patient to travel on hard or very soft ground and compelling him to\r\nturn on the sound leg as a pivot, with other motions calculated to\r\nbetray the locality of the pain.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--It is our conviction that lameness of the shoulder will in\r\nmany cases disappear with no other prescription than that of rest.\r\nProvided the lesions occasioning it are not too severe, time is all that\r\nis required. But the negation of letting alone is seldom accepted as a\r\nmeans of doing good, in the place of the active and the positive forms\r\nof treatment. This is in accordance with a trait of human nature which\r\nis universal, and is unlimited in its applications; hence something must\r\nbe done. In mild cases of shoulder lameness, then, the indications are\r\nwater, either in the cold douche or by showering, or by warm\r\nfomentations. Warm, wet blankets are of great service; in addition, or\r\nas alternative, anodyne liniments, camphor, belladonna, either in the\r\nform of tincture or the oils, are of benefit, and at a later period\r\nstimulating friction with suitable mixtures, sweating liniments,\r\nblistering compounds, subcutaneous injections over the region of the\r\nmuscle of 1-1/2 grains of veratrin (the variety insoluble in water)\r\nmixed in 2 drams of water, etc., will find their place, and finally,\r\nwhen necessity demands it, the firing iron and the seton.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the treatment must be determined by its effects and the\r\nevidence that may be offered of the results following the action of the\r\nreparative process. But the great essential condition of cure, and the\r\none without which the possibility of relapse will always remain as a\r\nmenace, is, as we have often reiterated in analogous cases, _rest_,\r\nimperatively rest, irrespective of any other prescriptions with which it\r\nmay be associated.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRAIN OF THE ELBOW MUSCLES.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--This injury, which fortunately is not very common, is mostly\r\nencountered in cities among heavy draft horses or rapidly driven animals\r\nwhich are obliged to travel, often smooth shod, upon slippery, icy, or\r\ngreasy pavements, where they are easily liable to lose their foothold.\r\nThe region of the strain is the posterior part of the shoulder, and the\r\naffected muscles are those which occupy the space between the posterior\r\nborder of the scapula and the posterior face of the arm. It is the\r\nmuscles of the olecranon which give way.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are easily recognized, especially when the\r\nanimal is in action. While at rest the attitude may be normal, or by\r\nclose scrutiny a peculiarity may perhaps be detected. The leg may seem\r\nto drop; the elbow may appear to be lower than its fellow, with the knee\r\nand lower part of the leg flexed and the foot resting on the toe, with\r\nthe heel raised. Such an attitude, however, may be occasionally assumed\r\nby an animal without having any special significance, but when it\r\nbecomes more pronounced in motion the fact acquires a symptomatic value,\r\nand this is the case in the present instance. A rapid gait becomes quite\r\nimpossible, and the walk, as in some few other diseases, becomes\r\nsufficiently characteristic to warrant a diagnosis even when observed\r\nfrom a distance. An entire dropping of the anterior part of the trunk\r\nbecomes manifest, and no weight is carried on the disabled side in\r\nconsequence of the loss of action in the suspensory muscles. There are\r\noften heat, pain, and swelling in the muscular mass at the elbow, though\r\nat times a hollow, or depression, may be observed near the posterior\r\nborder of the scapula, which is probably the seat of injury.\r\n\r\nThese hurts are of various degrees of importance, varying from mere\r\nminor casualties of quick recovery to lesions which are of sufficient\r\nseverity to render an animal useless and valueless for life.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The prime elements of treatment, which should be strictly\r\nobserved, are rest and quiet. Prescriptions of all kinds, of course,\r\nhave their advocates. Among them are ether, chloroform, camphor,\r\nalcoholic frictions, warm fomentations, blisters, setons, etc. Unless\r\nthe conclusions of experience are to be ignored, my own judgment is\r\ndecisive in favor of rest, judiciously applied, however, and my view of\r\nwhat constitutes a judicious application of rest has been more than once\r\npresented in these pages. There are degrees of this rest. One\r\ncontemplates simple immobility in a narrow stall. Another means the\r\nenforced mobility of the slings and a narrow stall as well. Another a\r\nbox stall, with ample latitude as to posture and space, and option to\r\nstand or lie down. As wide as this range may appear to be, radical\r\nrecovery has occurred under all of these modified forms of _letting our\r\npatients alone._\r\n\r\n\r\nHIP LAMENESS.\r\n\r\nThe etiology of injuries and diseases of the hip is one and the same\r\nwith that of the shoulder. The same causes operate and the same results\r\nfollow. The only essential change, with an important exception, which\r\nwould be necessary in passing from one region to the other in a\r\ndescription of its anatomy, its physiology, and its pathology would be a\r\nsubstitution of anatomical names in reference to certain bones,\r\narticulations, muscles, ligaments, and membranes concerned in the\r\ninjuries and diseases described. It would be only a useless repetition\r\nto cover again the ground over which we have so recently passed in\r\nrecital of the manner in which certain forms of external violence\r\n(falls, blows, kicks, etc.) result in other certain forms of lesion\r\n(luxation, fracture, periostitis, ostitis, etc.), and to recapitulate\r\nthe items of treatment and the names of the medicaments proper to use.\r\nThe same rules of diagnosis and the same indications and prognosis are\r\napplicable equally to every portion of the organism, with only such\r\nmodifications in applying dressings and apparatus as may be required by\r\ndifferences of conformation and other minor circumstances, which must\r\nsuggest themselves to the judgment of every experienced observer when\r\nthe occasion arrives for its exercise.\r\n\r\nAn exception is to be made, while considering the subject in connection\r\nwith the region now under advisement, in respect to the formidable\r\naffection known as morbus coxarius, or hip-joint disease; and leaving\r\nthe detail of other lesions to take their place under other heads, that\r\nrelating to the shoulder, for instance, we turn to the hip joint and its\r\nailments as the chief subject of our present consideration.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--In investigating for morbus coxarius, let the observer\r\nfirst examine the lame animal by scanning critically the outlines of the\r\njoint and the region adjacent for any difference of size or disturbance\r\nof symmetry in the parts, any prominence or rotundity, and on both\r\nsides. The lame side will probably be warmer, more developed, and\r\nfuller, both to the touch and to the eye. Let him then grasp the lower\r\npart of the leg (as he would in examining a case of shoulder lameness)\r\nand endeavor to produce excessive passive motion. This will probably\r\ncause pain when the leg is made to assume a given position. Let him push\r\nthe thigh forcibly against the hip bone, and the contact will again\r\nprobably cause a manifestation of pain. If the horse is trotted, the\r\nlimited action of the hip joint proper and the excessive dropping and\r\nrising of the hip of the opposite side will be easily recognized.\r\nUsually the animal does not extend the foot so far as customarily and\r\npicks it up much sooner.\r\n\r\nThe abductive or circumflex motion observed in shoulder lameness is also\r\npresent in hip lameness, but under special conditions, and the test of\r\nthe difficulty, either by traveling on soft ground or in turning the\r\nhorse in a circle, may here also contribute to the diagnosis, as in\r\ntesting for lameness in the anterior extremity.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis._--The prognosis of hip lameness is at times quite serious,\r\nnot only on account of the long duration of treatment required to effect\r\ngood results, and because of the character which may be assumed by the\r\ndisease, but of the permanence of the disability resulting from it.\r\nExostosis and ulcerative arthritis are sequelae which often resist every\r\nform of treatment.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--As before intimated, this is little more than a repetition\r\nof the remarks upon the lameness of the shoulder, with slight\r\nmodifications occasioned by the muscular structure of the hip, and we\r\nare limited to the same recommendations of treatment. The advantages of\r\nrest must be reaffirmed, with local applications, of which, however, it\r\nmay be said that they are more distinctly indicated and likely to be\r\nmore effective in their results than in shoulder lameness, and may be\r\nmore freely employed, whether in the form of liniments, blisters (singly\r\nor repeated), firing, or setoning.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRAINS OF SUSPENSORY LIGAMENTS AND OF FLEXOR TENDONS OR THEIR SHEATHS.\r\n\r\nThe fibrous structure situated behind the cannon bones, both in the fore\r\nand hind legs, is often the seat of lacerations or sprains resulting\r\nfrom violent efforts or sudden jerks.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--The injury may be considered serious or trifling, according to\r\nthe circumstances of each case as judged by its own history. Among the\r\npredisposing causes are a long, thin fetlock and a narrow knee or hock\r\nas viewed from the side, with the flexor muscles tied in just below the\r\njoint. The longer and more oblique the pastern the greater is the strain\r\non the flexor tendons and suspensory ligaments; hence a low quarter, a\r\ntoe calk, and no heel calks, or a thin calk placed at the tip under the\r\ntoe, and leaving the quarters long abnormally stretches the back tendons\r\nand causes a great strain upon them just before the weight is shifted\r\nfrom the foot in locomotion. In runners and hunters the disease is\r\nliable to be periodic. In driving horses it is most common in well-bred\r\nanimals of nervous temperament. Draft horses suffer most frequently in\r\nthe hind legs.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The injury is readily recognized by the changed aspect of\r\nthe region and the accompanying local symptoms. The parts which in\r\nhealth are well defined, with the outlines of the tendons and ligaments\r\nwell marked, become the seat of a swelling, more or less developed, from\r\na small spot on the middle of the back of the tendon to a tumefaction\r\nreaching from the knee down to and even involving the fetlock itself. It\r\nis always characterized by heat, and it is variously sensitive, ranging\r\nfrom a mere tenderness to a degree of soreness which shrinks from the\r\nlightest touch. The degree of the lameness varies, and it has a\r\ncorresponding range with the soreness, sometimes showing only a slight\r\nhalting and at others the extreme of lameness on three legs, with\r\nintermediate degrees.\r\n\r\nThe lameness is always worse when the weight is thrown on the foot and\r\nis most marked toward the end of the phase of contact with the ground.\r\nEither passive irritation of the leg or turning the animal in a circle\r\ncauses pain as in diseases of the joints. Sometimes the horse likes to\r\nget the heels on a stone or some elevation so as to relieve the weight\r\nfrom the flexor tendons. Finally, in cases of long standing, a\r\nshortening of the tendons occurs, resulting in the abnormal flexion of\r\nthe foot known by horsemen as \"broken down,\" or a more upright position\r\nof the foot may follow, producing perhaps knuckling or the so-called\r\nclubfoot.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis._--It may be safely assumed on general principles that a leg\r\nwhich has received such injuries seldom returns to a perfect condition\r\nof efficiency and soundness, and that as a fact a certain absolute\r\namount of thickening and deformity will remain permanent, even when the\r\nlameness has entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The injured member should receive the earliest attention\r\npossible, not only when the inflammatory condition is present, but when\r\nit is subsiding and there is only the thickening of the ligaments, the\r\ntendons, or the sheath.\r\n\r\nThe most important remedy is rest, and the shoes should always be\r\nremoved. During the first three days cold in the form of immersion or\r\ncontinuous irrigation is indicated. Then warm moisture and continuous\r\npressure are advised. The latter is best applied by placing two padded\r\nsplints about the thickness of the thumb along the two sides of the\r\ntendon and binding them in place with even pressure by bandage. Frequent\r\nbathing with warm soap suds is also beneficial. The absorption of the\r\nexudate may be promoted and the work of restoration effected by\r\nfrictions with alcohol, tincture of soap, spirits of camphor, mild\r\nliniments, strong, sweating liniments, and blisters. An excellent\r\nointment to apply with massage consists of equal parts of blue ointment\r\nand green soap, with double the quantity of vaseline. The action of\r\nblisters in these cases depends chiefly upon the massage used in\r\napplying them and upon the continuous pressure of the swollen skin on\r\nthe inflamed tendons. In old cases more beneficial results will follow\r\nline firing. In these cases shoeing is very important. Leave the\r\nquarters long, shorten the toe, give the shoe rolling motion, and either\r\nput short heel calks on the branches or thicken the branches. Although\r\nthis line of treatment is efficacious in many cases, there are others in\r\nwhich the thickening of the tendons refuses to yield and the changed\r\ntissues remain firmly organized, leaving them in the form of a thick\r\nmass resting upon the back part of the cannon bone.\r\n\r\n\r\nKNUCKLING OF FETLOCK.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of the last-mentioned lesion of the tendons, a new\r\ncondition presents itself in the articular disposition, constituting the\r\ndeformity known as the knuckling fetlock. (See also p. 400.)\r\n\r\nBy this is meant a deformity of the fetlock joint by which the natural\r\nangle is changed from that which pertains to the healthy articulation.\r\nThe first pastern, or suffraginis, loses its oblique direction and\r\nassumes another, which varies from the upright to the oblique, from\r\nbefore backward, and from above downward; in other words, forming an\r\nangle with its apex in front.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--This condition, as we have seen, may be the result of chronic\r\ndisease producing structural changes in the tendons, and it may also\r\noccur as the result of other affections or some peculiarity independent\r\nof this and situated below the fetlock, such as ringbones, sidebones, or\r\ntraumatic disease of the foot proper. Animals are sometimes predisposed\r\nto knuckling, such, for example, as are naturally straight in their\r\npasterns, or animals which are compelled to labor when too young. The\r\nhind legs are more predisposed than the fore to this deformity, in\r\nconsequence of the greater amount of labor they are required to perform\r\nas the propelling levers of the body.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms of knuckling are easily recognized. The\r\nchanges in the direction of the bones vary more or less with the degree\r\nof the lesion, sometimes assuming such a direction that it almost\r\nbecomes a true dislocation of the pastern.\r\n\r\nThe effect of knuckling upon the gait also varies according to the\r\ndegree of the deformity. As the different degrees of the shortening of\r\nthe leg affect the motion of the fetlock, the lameness may be very\r\nslight or quite extreme. Another consequence of this shortening is such\r\na change in the position of the foot that the heels cease to come in\r\ncontact with the ground and assume a greater elevation, and the final\r\nresult of this is soon witnessed in the development of a clubfoot.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--To whatever cause the knuckling may be ascribed, it is\r\nalways a severe infirmity, and there is but little room for hoping to\r\novercome it unless it be during the very first stages of the trouble,\r\nand the hope dwindles to still smaller dimensions when it is secondary\r\nto other diseases below the fetlock. If it is caused by overworking the\r\nanimal, the first indication, of course, will be rest. Line firing has\r\nproved very efficacious in these cases. The animal must be turned loose\r\nand left unemployed. Careful attention should be given to the condition\r\nof his feet and to the manner of shoeing, while time is allowed for the\r\ntendons to become restored to their normal state and the irritation\r\ncaused by excessive stretching has subsided. A shoe with a thick heel\r\nwill contribute to this. If no improvement can be obtained, however, and\r\nthe tendons though retracted have yet been relieved of much of their\r\nthickening, the case is not a desperate one, and may yet be benefited by\r\nthe operation of tenotomy, single or double--an operative expedient\r\nwhich must be committed to the experienced surgeon for its performance.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRUNG KNEES.\r\n\r\nThough not positively the result of diseases of the tendons acting upon\r\nthe knees, we venture to consider this deformity in connection with that\r\nwhich we have just described. It consists in such an alteration in the\r\ndirection and articulation of the bones which form the various carpal\r\njoints that instead of forming a vertical line from the lower end of the\r\nforearm to the cannon bone they are so united that the knee is more or\r\nless bent forward, presenting a condition caused by the retraction of\r\ntwo of the principal muscles by which the cannon bone is flexed.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--This flexion of the knee may be a congenital deformity and\r\nhave continued from the foaling of the animal; or, like clubfoot, it may\r\nbe the result of heavy labor which the animal has been compelled to\r\nperform when too young. It may also be due to other diseases existing in\r\nparts below the knee joint.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--This change of direction largely influences the movement of\r\nthe animal by detracting from its firmness and practically weakening the\r\nentire frame, even to the extent of rendering him insecure on his feet\r\nand liable to fall. This condition of weakness is sometimes so\r\npronounced that he is exposed to fall even when standing at rest and\r\nunmolested, the knees being unable even to bear their portion of the\r\nmere weight of the frame. This results in another trouble--that of being\r\nunable to keep permanently upright. He is liable to fall on his knees,\r\nand by this act becomes presently a sufferer from the lesion known by\r\nthe term of \"broken knees.\"\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Whatever may be the originating cause of this\r\nimperfection, it detracts very largely from the usefulness and value of\r\na horse, disqualifying him for ordinary labor and wholly unfitting him\r\nfor service under the saddle without jeopardizing the safety of his\r\nrider. If, however, the trouble is known from the start, and is not the\r\nresult of congenital deformity or weakness of the knee joint, or\r\nsecondary to other diseases, rest, with fortifying frictions, may\r\nsometimes aid in strengthening the joints; and the application of\r\nblisters on the posterior part of the knee, from a short distance above\r\nto a point a little below the joint, may be followed by some\r\nsatisfactory results; but with this trouble, as with knuckling fetlocks,\r\nthe danger of relapse must be kept in mind as a contingency always\r\nliable to occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURB.\r\n\r\nThis lesion is the bulging backward of the posterior part of the hock,\r\nwhere in the normal state there should be a straight line, extending\r\nfrom the upper end of the point of the hock down to the fetlock.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--The cause may be a sprain of the tendon which passes on the\r\nposterior part of the hock, or of one of its sheaths, or of the strong\r\nligament situated on the posterior border of the os calcis.\r\n\r\nHocks of a certain conformation seems to possess a greater liability to\r\ncurb than others. They are overbent, coarse, and thick in appearance, or\r\nmay be too narrow from front to back across the lower portion. This\r\ncondition may therefore result as a sequence to congenital malformation,\r\nas in the case of horses that are \"saber-legged.\" It often occurs, also,\r\nas the result of violent efforts, of heavy pulling, of high jumping, or\r\nof slipping; in a word, it may result from any of the causes heretofore\r\nconsidered as instrumental in producing lacerations of muscular,\r\ntendinous, or ligamentous structure.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--A hock affected with curb will present at the outset a\r\nswelling more or less diffuse on its posterior portion, with varying\r\ndegrees of heat and soreness, and these will be accompanied with\r\nlameness of a permanent character. At a later period, however, the\r\nswelling will become better defined, the deformity more characteristic,\r\nthe prominent, curved line readily detected, and the thickness of the\r\ninfiltrated tissue easily determined by the fingers. At this time, also,\r\nthere may be a condition of lameness, varying in degree, while at\r\nothers, again, the irregularity of action at the hock will be so slight\r\nas to escape detection, the animal betraying no appearance of its\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nA curb constitutes, by a strict construction of the term, an\r\n\"unsoundness,\" since the hock thus affected is less able to endure\r\nsevere labor, and is more liable to give way with the slightest effort.\r\nYet the prognosis of a curb can not be considered to be serious, as it\r\ngenerally yields to treatment, or at least the lameness it may occasion\r\nis generally easily relieved, though the loss of contour caused by the\r\nbulging will always constitute a blemish.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--On the first appearance of a curb, when it exhibits the\r\nsigns of an acute inflammation, the first indication is to subdue it by\r\nthe use of cold applications, as intermittent or constant irrigation or\r\nan ice poultice; when these have exhausted their effect and the swelling\r\nhas assumed better defined boundaries, and the infiltration of the\r\ntendons or of the ligaments is all that remains of a morbid state, then\r\nevery effort must be directed to the object of effecting its absorption\r\nand reducing its dimensions by pressure and other methods. The\r\nmedicaments most to be trusted are blisters of cantharides and frictions\r\nwith ointments of iodin, or, preferably, biniodid of mercury. Mercurial\r\nagents alone, by their therapeutic properties or by means of the\r\nartificial bandages which they furnish by their incrustations when their\r\nvesicatory effects are exhausted, will give good results in some\r\ninstances by a single application, and often by repeated applications.\r\nThe use of the firing iron must, however, be frequently resorted to,\r\neither to remove the lameness or to stimulate the absorption. We believe\r\nthat its early application ought to be resorted to in preference to\r\nwaiting until the exudation is firmly organized. Firing in dull points\r\nor in lines will prove as beneficial in curb as in any other disease of\r\na similar nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nLACERATED TENDONS.\r\n\r\nThis form of injury, whether of a simple or of a compound character, may\r\nbecome a lesion of a very serious nature, and will usually require long\r\nand careful treatment, which may yet prove unavailing in consequence\r\neither of the intrinsically fatal character of the wound itself or the\r\ncomplications which have rendered it incurable.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--Like all similar injuries, they are the result of traumatic\r\nviolence, such as contact with objects either blunt or sharp; a\r\ncurb-stone in the city; in the country, a tree stump or a fence,\r\nespecially one of wire. It may easily occur to a runaway horse when he\r\nis \"whipped\" with fragments of harness or \"flogged\" by fragments of\r\nsplintered shafts \"thrashing\" his legs, or by the contact of his legs\r\nwith the wagon he has overturned and shattered with his heels while\r\ndisengaging himself from the wreck.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--It is not always necessary that the skin be involved in\r\nthis form of injury. On the contrary, the tegument is frequently left\r\nentirely intact, especially when the injury follows infectious diseases\r\nor occurs during light exercise after long periods of rest in the\r\nstable. Again, the skin may be cut through and the tendons nearly\r\nsevered. A point a little above the fetlock is usually the seat of the\r\ninjury. But irrespective of this, and whether the skin is or is not\r\nimplicated, the symptoms resemble very much those of a fracture. There\r\nis excessive mobility, at least more than in a normal state, with more\r\nor less inability to carry weight. There may be swelling of the parts,\r\nand on passing the hands carefully along the tendon to the point of\r\ndivision the stumps of the divided structure will be felt more or less\r\nseparated, perhaps wholly divided. The position of the animal while at\r\nrest and standing is peculiar and characteristic. While the heels are\r\nwell placed on the ground, the toe is correspondingly elevated, with a\r\ntendency to turn up--a form of breaking down which was described when\r\nspeaking of the fracture of the sesamoids. Carrying weight is done only\r\nwith considerable difficulty, but with comparatively little pain, and\r\nthe animal will unconsciously continue to move the leg as if in great\r\nsuffering, notwithstanding the fact that his general condition may be\r\nvery good and his appetite unimpaired.\r\n\r\nThe effect upon the general organism of compound lacerated wounds of\r\ntendinous structures, or those which are associated with injuries of the\r\nskin, are different. The wound becomes in a short time the seat of a\r\nhigh degree of inflammation, with abundant suppuration filling it from\r\nthe bottom; the tendon, whether as the result of the bruise or of the\r\nlaceration, or of maceration in the accumulated pus, undergoes a process\r\nof softening, and necrosis and sloughing ensue. This complicates the\r\ncase and probably some form of tendinous synovitis follows, running into\r\nsuppurative arthritis, to end, if close to a joint, with a fatal result.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis._--The prognosis of lacerated tendons should be very\r\nconservative. Under the most favorable circumstances a period of from\r\nsix weeks to two months will be necessary for the treatment, before the\r\nformation of the cicatricial callus and the establishment of a firm\r\nunion between the tendinous stumps.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--As with fractures, and even in a greater degree, the\r\nnecessity is imperative, in the treatment of lacerated tendons, to\r\nobtain as perfect a state of immobility as can be obtained compatibly\r\nwith the disposition of the patient; the natural opposition of the\r\nanimal, sometimes ill-tempered and fractious at best, under the\r\nnecessary restraint causing at times much embarrassment to the\r\npractitioner in applying the necessary treatment. Without the necessary\r\nimmobility there can be no close connection of the ends of the tendons.\r\nTo fulfill this necessary condition the posterior part of the foot and\r\nthe fetlock must be supported and the traction performed by them\r\nrelieved, an object which can be obtained by the use of the high-heeled\r\nand bar shoe, or possibly better accomplished with a shoe of the same\r\nkind extending about 2 or 2-1/2 inches back of the heels. The perfect\r\nimmobility of the legs is obtained in the same way as in the treatment\r\nof fracture, with splints, bandages, iron apparatus, plaster of adhesive\r\nmixtures, and similar means. So long as the dressings remain in place\r\nundisturbed and no chafing or other evidence of pain is present, the\r\ndressings may be continued without changing, the patient being kept in\r\nthe slings for a period sufficient to insure the perfect union of the\r\ntendons. For a compound lesion when there is laceration of the skin some\r\nspecial care is necessary. The wound must be carefully watched and the\r\ndressings removed at intervals of a few days or as often as may be\r\nneedful, all of which additional manipulation and extra nursing, however\r\nindispensable, still adds to the gravity of the case and renders the\r\nprognosis more and more serious. When the tendons have sloughed in\r\nthreads of various dimensions, or if in the absence of this process of\r\nmortification healthy granulations should form and fill up the wound,\r\nstill very careful attention will be required, the granulating ends of\r\nthe tendons having a tendency to bulge between the edges of the skin and\r\nto assume large dimensions, forming bulky excrescences or growths of a\r\nwarty or cauliflower appearance, the removal of which becomes a\r\ntroublesome matter.\r\n\r\nThe union of the tendons will at times leave a thickening of varying\r\ndegree near the point of cicatrization, the absorption of which becomes\r\nan object of difficult and doubtful accomplishment, but which may be\r\npromoted by moderate blistering and the use of alterative and absorbent\r\nmixtures or perhaps the fire iron. A shoe with heels somewhat higher\r\nthan usual will prove a comfort to the animal and aid in moderating and\r\nrelieving the tension of the tendons.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUPTURE OF THE FLEXOR METATARSI.\r\n\r\nThis is a muscle of the anterior part of the shank. It is situated in\r\nfront of the tibia, and is of peculiar formation, being composed of a\r\nmuscular portion with a very powerful tendon, which are at first\r\ndistinct and separate, to be intimately united lower down, and\r\nterminating at the lower end by a division into four tendinous bands. It\r\nis a powerful muscle of the hinder shank bone, and also acts as a\r\nstrong means of support for the stifle joint; that is, of the\r\narticulation of the thigh and shank bone, in front and outside of which\r\nit passes. Its situation and its use cause it to be liable to severe\r\nstretching and straining, and a rupture of some of its fibers is\r\nsometimes the consequence.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--This injury may be the result of a violent effort of the\r\nanimal in leaping over a high obstacle; in missing his foothold and\r\nsuddenly slipping backward while powerfully grasping the ground with the\r\nfeet in striving to start a heavily loaded vehicle; in making a violent\r\neffort to prevent a probable fall; or in attempting to lift the feet\r\nfrom miry ground.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The accident is immediately followed by disability which\r\nwill vary according to the true seat of the injury and the period of its\r\nduration. This rupture will not prevent the horse from standing\r\nperfectly and firmly on his feet when kept at rest, and while no\r\nmuscular efforts are required from him there is no appearance of any\r\nlesion or unsoundness. An attempt to move him backward, however, will\r\ncause him to throw all his weight upon his hind-quarters, and he will\r\nrefuse to raise his foot from the ground. If compelled to do so, or\r\nrequired to move forward, the hock being no longer capable of flexion,\r\nthe muscle which effects that movement being the injured one, the\r\nopposite muscles, the extensors, acting freely, the entire lower part of\r\nthe leg, from the hock down, will be suddenly, with a jerk, extended on\r\nthe tibia or shank bone, and simultaneously with this the tendo\r\nAchillis, the cord of the hock, the tendons of the extensors of the hock\r\nwill be put in a wrinkled and relaxed condition. The leg is behind the\r\nanimal and the toe rests on the ground. Examination of the fore part of\r\nthe shank from the stifle down to the hock may reveal soreness, and\r\npossibly some swelling and heat at the seat of the lesion.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Our experience with injuries of this form convinces us\r\nthat, generally speaking, they are amenable to treatment. Provided a\r\nsufficient time has been allowed for union to take place, very few\r\ninstances in which radical recovery has not been effected have come to\r\nour knowledge. The more flexed the leg can be kept, the quicker will it\r\nheal.\r\n\r\nIn these cases, as in those of simple laceration of tendons, already\r\nconsidered, the indications resemble those which apply in the treatment\r\nof fractures, as near as coaptation of the lacerated ends is possible,\r\nwith immobility, being the necessary conditions to secure. The first is\r\na matter of very difficult accomplishment, by bandaging alone, and some\r\nhave recommended instead the application of charges or blisters in order\r\nto compel the animal to keep more quiet.\r\n\r\nTo secure the necessary immobility the animal should be placed in slings\r\nsnugly applied, and kept in a narrow stall. He should also be tied\r\nshort, and restrained from any backward movement by ropes or boards, and\r\nshould, moreover, be kept in as quiet a temper as possible by the\r\nexclusion of all causes of irritation or excitement. Weeks must then\r\nelapse, not less, but frequently more than six, often eight, before he\r\ncan be considered out of danger and able to return to his labor, which\r\nshould for a time be light and easy, and gradually, if ever, increased\r\nto the measure of a thoroughly sound and strong animal. If he is used\r\ntoo soon the newly formed tissue between the ends of the muscle will be\r\nliable to stretch and leave the flexor muscle too long and permanently\r\ndisplaced.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDRY ADDITIONAL AFFECTIONS OF THE EXTREMITIES.\r\n\r\nAmong these there are three which will principally occupy our attention,\r\nand, which may be considered as forming a single group. In some parts of\r\nthe legs may be found certain peculiar little structures of a saclike\r\nformation, containing an oily substance designed for the lubrication of\r\nthe parts upon which they are placed for the purpose of facilitating the\r\nmovements of the tendons which pass over them. These little sacs or\r\nmuco-synovial capsules, under peculiar conditions of traumatism, are\r\nliable to become subject to a diseased process, which consists\r\nprincipally in a hypersecretion of their contents and an increase in\r\ndimensions, and they may undergo peculiar pathological changes of such\r\ncharacter as to disable an animal, and in many instances to cause\r\nserious blemishes which can but depreciate its value. These growths,\r\nwhich are known as hygromata, may result from external violence, as\r\nblows or bruises, and may appear in the form of small, soft tumors,\r\npainless and not inflammatory in character, but, by a repetition of the\r\ncause or renewal of violence, liable to acquire increased severity.\r\nSevere inflammation, with suppuration, may follow, which, filling up the\r\ncavity, the walls will become thickened and hard, resulting in the\r\nformation of a tumor.\r\n\r\nThe elbow, the knee, and the hock are the parts of the body where these\r\nlesions are ordinarily found, and on account of their peculiar shape and\r\nthe position they occupy they have received the denomination \"capped.\"\r\nThey will be considered in their peculiar aspect.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPPED ELBOW.\r\n\r\nCapped elbow, or \"shoe boil,\" is a term applied to an enlargement often\r\nfound at the point of the elbow.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--This lesion is due to injury or pressure of the part while it\r\nis resting on the ground. The horse, unlike the cow, does not rest\r\ndirectly on the under surface of the sternum, or breastbone, on account\r\nof its sharp, ridge-like formation. He rests more on the side of the\r\nbreastbone and chest, and consequently the leg which is flexed under\r\nthe body is subject to considerable pressure. If the leg is flexed under\r\nthe body so that the hoof or shoe is directly in contact with the elbow,\r\nwhich may occur in horses having an extremely long cannon bone or\r\nexcessive length in the shoes, the greater part of the weight of the\r\nchest is concentrated at this point and the pressure may cause a bruise\r\nor an inflammation.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Under these conditions the point of the elbow may become\r\nswollen and tender and exhibit heat and pain. This swelling may not only\r\ncover the point of the elbow, but sometimes reaches the axilla and\r\nassumes such proportions that there is great difficulty in using the\r\nleg, the animal showing signs of lameness even to the extent of the\r\ncircumflex step, as in shoulder lameness. This edematous condition,\r\nhowever, does not remain stationary. It may by degrees subside or\r\nperhaps disappear. In the first instance it will become more distinctly\r\ndefined, with better marked boundaries, until it is reduced to a soft,\r\nround, fluctuating tumor, with or without heat or pain. There is then\r\neither a bloody or serous tumor or a purulent collection, and following\r\nthe puncture of its walls with the knife there will be an escape of\r\nblood, serum, or pus, as the case may be, in variable quantities. In\r\neither case, but principally in that of the cystic form, the tumor will\r\nbe found to be subdivided by septa, or bands running in various\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nVarious changes will follow the opening of the tumor and the escape of\r\nits contents. In a majority of cases the process of cicatrization will\r\ntake place, and the cavity fill up by granulation, the discharge, at\r\nfirst abundant, gradually diminishing and the wound closing, usually\r\nwithout leaving any mark. At times, however, and especially if the\r\ndisease has several times repeated its course, there may remain a\r\npendulous sac, partly obliterated, which a sufficient amount of\r\nexcitement or irritation may soon restore to its previous dimensions and\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nIn other cases an entirely different process takes place. The walls of\r\nthe cavity, cyst, or abscess become ulcerated and thickened, the\r\ngranulations of the sac become fibrous in their structure and fill up\r\nthe cavity, and it assumes the character of a hard tumor on the back of\r\nthe elbow, sometimes partly and sometimes entirely covered by the skin.\r\nIt is fibrous in its nature, painless to the touch, well defined in its\r\ncontour, and may vary in size from that of a small apple to that of a\r\nchild's head.\r\n\r\nThis last form of capped elbow is the most serious of any, resisting all\r\nknown forms of mild treatment, and removable by the knife only. The\r\nother forms, even that with the inflammatory aspect and its large\r\nedematous swelling which interferes with the work of the animal, may\r\njustify a much milder prognosis, and, aside from their liability to\r\nrecur, may be ranked with the comparatively harmless affections.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--So long as the danger of recurrence is the principal bad\r\nfeature of capped elbow the most important consideration is that of\r\ndevising a means for its prevention. To prevent the animal from lying\r\ndown is evidently the simplest method of keeping the heels and the elbow\r\napart; but the impracticability of this prescription is apparent, since\r\nmost animals are obliged to lie down when they sleep, though it is true\r\nthat a few take their sleep on their feet. The question of shoeing here\r\nenters into the discussion. The shortening of the inside branch of the\r\nshoe, which is the one with which the pressure is made, may be of\r\nadvantage, and especially if the truncated end of the shoe is smooth and\r\nfiled over to remove all possibility of pressure and contusion upon the\r\nskin. The protection of the skin of the elbow by interposing soft\r\ntissues between that and the shoe, or by bandaging the heel with bags or\r\ncovering it with boots, is considered by many the best of the preventive\r\nmethods, and the advantage to be obtained by resorting to it can not be\r\noverlooked when the number of horses which develop shoe boil whenever\r\nthe use of the boot is intermitted is considered. In order to prevent\r\nthe animal from assuming the sternal decubitus, many give preference to\r\nthe plan of fastening a piece of wood across the stall at some distance\r\nfrom the front wall or manger. It is a simple expedient, primitive,\r\nperhaps, but nevertheless practical, and followed by good results.\r\n\r\nThe therapeutic treatment is also important. The edematous swelling,\r\nwhen recognized by its external appearance and the existing\r\ninflammation, should be treated without delay. Warm fomentations,\r\nrepeated several times daily, are then indicated, the degree of warmth\r\nbeing as high as can be borne comfortably. They are easily applied and\r\noften yield decided relief in a few hours. In some cases, however,\r\nastringents, in the form of poultices or pastes, are used in preference;\r\nthese are made to cover the entire swelling and allowed to remain,\r\ndrying after a short time, it is true, and perhaps falling off, but are\r\neasily renewed and reapplied. An excellent astringent for these cases is\r\na putty made of powdered chalk and vinegar (acetate of lime), and the\r\nwhole swelling is then covered with a thick coating of soft clay made\r\ninto a mass with water.\r\n\r\nThese simple remedies are often all that is required. Under their use\r\nthe swelling passes off by degrees and after a short interval the animal\r\nis fit for work again, but not uncommonly instead a swelling develops,\r\npuffy, not painful, and perhaps giving a sensation of crepitation when\r\npressure is applied with the finger. It is soft, evidently contains a\r\nliquid, and when freely opened with a good-sized incision discharges a\r\ncertain quantity of blood, partly liquid and partly coagulated, and\r\nperhaps a little hemorrhage will follow. The cavity should then be well\r\nwashed out and a plug of oakum introduced, leaving a small portion\r\nprotruding through the cut to prevent it from closing prematurely. It\r\nmay be taken off the next day, and a daily cleansing will then be all\r\nthat is necessary. In another case the tumor becomes very soft in its\r\nwhole extent, with evident fluctuation and a well-defined form. The\r\ndischarge of the fluid is then indicated, and a free incision will be\r\nfollowed by the escape of a quantity of thin yellowish liquid from a\r\nsingle sac. The wound should be kept clean and dressed frequently, in\r\norder to insure prompt healing. But if the cavity is found to be\r\nsubdivided in its interior by numerous bands and the cyst proves to be\r\nmultilocular the partitions should be torn out with the fingers and the\r\ncavity then treated in the same manner as the unilocular sac. In still\r\nanother case the swelling may be warm and painful with indistinct\r\nfluctuation, or fluctuation only at a certain point. This indicates an\r\nabscess, and necessitates an incision to drain the pus, followed by the\r\ncareful cleansing and dressing of the wound.\r\n\r\nBut cases occur in which all the treatment that has been described fails\r\nto effect a full recovery, and instead a fibrous tumor begins to\r\ndevelop. A change of treatment is, of course, then in order. The\r\ninflammation being chronic will necessitate stimulating treatment of the\r\npart in order to increase the process of absorption. We must again draw\r\nupon the resources of experience in the form of blisters, the\r\nfomentations, the iodin, and the mercurial ointments, as heretofore\r\nmentioned. Good results may always be insured from their judicious and\r\ntimely administration. In applying the powerful mineral inunctions much\r\npatience and wisdom are required. It should be done by carefully and\r\nperseveringly rubbing in small quantities daily; it should be done\r\nsoftly and gently, not with force, nor with the expectation of producing\r\nan astonishing effect by heavy dosing and main strength in a few hours;\r\nit should be after the manner of a siege rather than that of a charge.\r\nThe object is to induce the drugs to permeate the affected part until\r\nthe entire mass is penetrated. Of course cases will be encountered which\r\nresist all forms of medical treatment. The tumor remains as a fixed\r\nfact; it continues to grow; it is large and pendulous at the elbow; its\r\nweight is estimated in pounds; it is not an eyesore merely, but an\r\nuncomfortable, burdensome mass, excoriating all the surrounding parts\r\nand being itself excoriated in turn; mild treatment has failed and is no\r\nlonger to be relied on.\r\n\r\nResort must now be made to surgical methods, and here again we must\r\nchoose between the ligature, the cautery, and the knife. Each has its\r\nadvocates among practitioners. In a case like the present, one of the\r\ndifficulties arises in connection with the application and retention of\r\nbandages and other dressings after the amputation has been performed. It\r\nis a somewhat difficult problem, owing to the conformation and\r\nproportions of the body of the patient, and involves the exercise of\r\nconsiderable practical ingenuity to adjust and retain the appliances\r\nnecessary to insure a good final result.\r\n\r\nIn the long description of the treatment of the varieties of capped\r\nelbow I have thus far omitted any mention of one method which is\r\npracticed and commended by not a few. I refer to the use of setons,\r\nintroduced through the tumor. My own experience and the observation of\r\nmany failures from this method led me to abandon it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPPED KNEE.\r\n\r\nThe passage of the tendons of the extensor muscle of the cannon, as it\r\nglides in front of the knee joint, is assisted by one of the little\r\nbursae before mentioned, and when this becomes the seat of dropsical\r\ncollection a hygroma is formed and the knee is \"capped.\" Though in its\r\nhistory somewhat analogous to the capped elbow, there are points of\r\ndifference between them. Their development may prove a source of great\r\nannoyance from the fact of the blemish which they constitute.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--The capped knee presents itself under various conditions. It\r\nis sometimes the result of a bruise or contusion, often repeated,\r\ninflicted upon himself by a horse addicted to the habit of pawing while\r\nin the stable and striking the front of the stall with his knees.\r\nAnother class of patients is formed of those weak-kneed animals which\r\nare subject to falling and bruising the front of the joint against the\r\nground, the results not being always of the same character.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The lesion may be a simple bruise, or it may be a severe\r\ncontusion with swelling, edema, heat, and pain. The joint becomes so\r\nstiff and rigid that it interferes with locomotion and yet under careful\r\nsimple treatment the trouble may disappear.\r\n\r\nAgain, instead of altogether passing off, the edema may diminish in\r\nextent, becoming more defined in form and may remain as a swelling on\r\nthe front part of the knee. Resulting from the crushing of small blood\r\nvessels, this is necessarily full of blood. The swelling is somewhat\r\nsoft, diffuse, not painful, more or less fluctuating, and after a few\r\ndays becomes crepitant under the pressure of the hand.\r\n\r\nInstead of being filled with blood the swelling may be full of serum, as\r\noften occurs when violence, though perhaps slight, has been frequently\r\nrepeated. In that case the swelling is generally well defined, soft, and\r\npainless, with more or less fluctuation, and it may even become\r\npendulous. In other cases the swelling may be of an acute, inflammatory\r\nnature, with heat and pain, accompanied with stiffness of the joint.\r\nThis leads to the formation of an abscess. Whatever the nature of these\r\nswellings may be, either full of blood, serum, or pus, some blemish\r\nusually remains after treatment.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis._--Though simple bruises of the knee without extensive\r\nlesions are usually of trifling account, a different prognosis must be\r\npronounced when the lesion assumes more important dimensions, and though\r\na capped knee may be comparatively of little importance we have seen\r\ncases in which not only extensive blemishes were left to disfigure the\r\npatient, but the animals had become worthless in consequence of the\r\nextension of the diseased process to the various elements composing the\r\njoint, and giving rise to the most complicated cases of carpitis.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Usually the first symptom of trouble is the edematous\r\nswelling on the front of the \"knee.\" The prevention of the inflammation\r\nand consequently of the abscess, is the prime object in view, and it may\r\nbe realized by the use of warm-water fomentations or compresses applied\r\nover the swelling, which may be used either in a simple form or combined\r\nwith astringents, such as Goulard's extract, alum, or sulphate of zinc.\r\nThe application of warm poultices of oil meal or ground flaxseed,\r\nenveloping the whole joint and kept in place by bandages, is often\r\nfollowed by absorption of the swelling, or, if the abscess is in process\r\nof formation, by the active excretion of pus. If an abscess forms in\r\nspite of these precautions it may be treated surgically in several ways.\r\n\r\nIn one it should be done by a careful incision, which will allow the\r\nescape of the blood or the serum, or of the pus which is inclosed in the\r\nsac; in another it may be by means of a seton, in order that the\r\ndischarge may be maintained and allowed to escape; for another we may\r\nadopt the more cautious manner of emptying the cavity by means of\r\npunctures with small trocars or aspirators. The danger attending this\r\nlast method arises from the possible sloughing of large portions of the\r\nskin, while that attending the first is the hazard of the possibility of\r\nthe extension of the inflammation to the capsular ligament of the knee,\r\nwith the possibility of an open joint in prospect.\r\n\r\nAs we have remarked, the cavity after being emptied may rapidly close\r\nand leave in a short time but slight traces of its previous existence.\r\nBut in many, if not in most cases, there will remain, after the\r\ncicatrization is complete, a thickening or organized exudation at one\r\ntime round and well defined, at another spreading by a diffused\r\ninfiltration, to which it will be necessary to give immediate attention,\r\nfrom the fact of its tendency to form into an organized and permanent\r\nbody. To stimulate inflammation in this diseased structure, blisters are\r\nrecommended, but chiefly for the purpose of promoting the process of\r\nabsorption.\r\n\r\nIf this treatment fails, the use of iodin and mercurial preparations is\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\nPlain mercurial or plain iodin ointment, or both in combination as iodid\r\nof mercury, are commonly used, and may be applied either moderately and\r\nby gentle degrees, as we have suggested, or more freely and vigorously\r\nwith a view to more immediate effects, which, however, will also be\r\nmore superficial. The use of the firing iron applied deeply with fine\r\npoints is then to be strongly recommended, to be followed by blisters\r\nand various liniments. This course may generally be relied on as quite\r\nsure to be followed by satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nWhile the treatment is in progress it will, of course, be necessary to\r\nsecure the animal in such manner that a recurrence of the injury will be\r\nimpossible from similar causes to those which were previously\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPPED HOCK.\r\n\r\nA bad habit of rubbing or striking the partitions of their stalls with\r\ntheir hocks prevails among some horses, with the result of an injury\r\nwhich shows itself on the upper points of those bones, the summit of the\r\nos calcis. From its analogy to the condition of capped elbow the\r\ndesignation of capped hock has been applied to this condition.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--A capped hock is therefore but the development of a bruise\r\nat the point of the hock, which if many times repeated may excite an\r\ninflammatory process, with all its usual external symptoms of swelling,\r\nheat, soreness, and the rest of the now-familiar phenomena. The swelling\r\nis at first diffused, extending more or less on the exterior part of the\r\nhock, and in a few instances running up along the tendons and muscles of\r\nthe back of the shank. Soon, however, unless the irritating causes are\r\ncontinued and repeated, the edema diminishes, and, becoming more defined\r\nin its external outlines, leaves the hock capped with a hygroma. The\r\nhygroma, at the very beginning of the trouble, contains a bloody\r\nserosity which soon becomes strictly serum, and this, through the\r\ninfluence of an acute inflammatory action, is liable to undergo a change\r\nwhich converts it into the usual purulent product of suppuration.\r\n\r\nThe external appearance ought to be sufficient to determine the\r\ndiagnosis, but there are a few signs which may contribute toward a nicer\r\nidentification of the lesion. The capped hock, whether under the\r\nappearance of an acute, edematous swelling, or as a bloody serous\r\ncollection, or as a simple serous cyst, does not give rise to any\r\nremarkable local manifestation other than such as have already passed\r\nunder our survey in considering similar cases, nor will it be liable to\r\ninterfere with the functions which belong to the member in question,\r\nunless it assumes very large dimensions and on each side of the tendons,\r\nas well as on the summit of the bone. But if the inflammation is quite\r\nhigh, if suppuration is developing, if there is a true abscess, or--and\r\nthis is a common complication--especially when the kicking or rubbing of\r\nthe animal is frequently recurring, then, besides the local trouble of\r\nthe cyst or of the abscess, the bones become diseased and the periosteum\r\ninflamed; perhaps the superior ends of the bone and its fibro-cartilage\r\nbecome affected, and a simple lesion or bruise, whatever it may have\r\nbeen, becomes complicated with periostitis and ostitis, and is naturally\r\naccompanied with lameness, developed in a greater or less degree, which\r\nin some cases may be permanent and in others increased by work. These\r\ncomplications, however, are not common or frequent.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Capped hocks are in many cases amenable to treatment, and\r\nyet they often become the opprobrium of the practioner by remaining, as\r\nthey frequently do, an eyesore on the top of the hock; they do not\r\ninterfere, it is true, with the work of the horse, but fixing upon him\r\nthe stigma of what, in human estimation, is a most unreliable and\r\nobjectionable reputation, to wit, that of being an habitual \"kicker,\"\r\nand, worse than all, one that kicks when fed.\r\n\r\nThe maxim that \"an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\" fits\r\nthe present case very neatly. A horse whose hocks have a somewhat puffy\r\nlook and whose skin on the front of the hock is loose and flabby, justly\r\nsubjects himself to a suspicion of addictedness to this bad habit, but a\r\nlittle watching will soon establish the truth. If, then, the verdict is\r\none of conviction, precautions should be immediately adopted against a\r\ncontinuance of the evil. The padding of the sides of the stall with\r\nstraw mats or mattresses and covering the posts with similar material,\r\nin such manner as to expose no hard surface with which to come in\r\ncontact, will reduce the evil to its minimum. The animal may jar his\r\nframe when he kicks, but even then there will be less force in the\r\nconcussion than if it impinged upon the solid plank, and cuts and\r\nabrasions can not be inflicted by a properly made cushion. Hobbles are\r\nalso rightly recommended with a view to the required restraint of\r\nmotion, so applied as to secure the leg with which the kicking is\r\nperformed, or even both hind legs, in such manner as not to interfere\r\nwith the movement of lying down and rising again and yet preventing that\r\nof kicking backward. Boots similar in pattern to those which are used\r\nfor the prevention of shoe boil are also prescribed. These are placed\r\nabove the hock and retained by straps tightly fastened. We apprehend,\r\nhowever, that the difficulty of retaining them in the proper place\r\nwithout the danger of chafing from the tightness of the straps may form\r\nan objection to their use. Notwithstanding all precautions, hocks will\r\nbe capped in the future as in the past, and the study of their treatment\r\nwill always be in order.\r\n\r\nThe mode of dealing with them will, of course, be greatly influenced by\r\nthe condition of the parts. When the inflammation is excessive and the\r\nswelling large, hot, and painful to the touch, the application of warm\r\nwater will be very painful. The leg should be well fomented several\r\ntimes a day, for from 15 to 20 minutes each time, a strong decoction of\r\nmarsh-mallow leaves being added to the water, and after each application\r\nswathed with flannel bandages soaked in the same warm mixture. A few\r\ndays of this treatment will usually effect a resolution of the\r\ninflammation; if not complete, at least sufficiently so to disclose the\r\ncorrect outlines of the hygroma and exhibit its peculiar and specific\r\nsymptoms. The expediency of its removal and the method of accomplishing\r\nit are then to be considered, with the question of opening it to give\r\nexit to its contents. If the fluid is of a purulent character, the\r\nindication is in favor of its immediate discharge. No time should be\r\nlost, and it should be by means of a small opening made with a narrow\r\nbistoury. If, however, the fluid is a serosity, we prefer to remove it\r\nby punctures with a very small trocar. Our reason for special caution in\r\nthese cases is our fear of the possibility of the existence of diseased\r\nconditions of a severe character in the pseudo joint. For the same\r\nreason we prefer the treatment of those growths by external\r\napplications. In the first stages of the disease a severe and stiff\r\nblister, such as the cantharidate of collodium, entirely covering the\r\ncyst, perhaps not yet completely formed, when the inflammation has\r\nsubsided, will be of great benefit by its stimulating effect, the\r\nabsorption it may excite, and the pressure which, when dry, it will\r\nmaintain upon the tumor. If, however, the thickening of the growth fails\r\nto diminish, it should be treated with some of the iodin preparations in\r\nthe form of ointments, pure or in combination with potassium, mercury,\r\netc., of various strengths and in various proportions. My opinion of\r\nsetons is not favorable, but the actual cautery, by deep and fine\r\nfiring, in points--needle cauterization--I believe to be the best mode\r\nof treatment, and especially when applied early.\r\n\r\nA very satisfactory way to treat these cases is to burst the swelling by\r\npressure from without. A strap or strong linen bandage is placed about\r\nthe hock, pressing on the bursa, while the affected leg is on the\r\nground, the other hind foot being lifted up. When the bandage is in\r\nplace the leg should be released, and the horse will violently flex the\r\nbandaged limb and produce pressure on the bursa, with consequent\r\nbursting and discharging of its contents.\r\n\r\nWhatever treatment may be adopted for capped hock, patience must be one\r\nof the ingredients. In these parts absorption is slow, the skin is very\r\nthick, and its return to a soft, pliable, natural condition, if effected\r\nat all, will take place only after weeks added to other weeks of medical\r\ntreatment and patient waiting.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERFERING, AND SPEEDY CUTS.\r\n\r\nThese designations belong to certain special injuries of the\r\nextremities, produced by similar causes, giving rise to kindred\r\npathological lesions with allied phenomena, requiring about the same\r\ntreatment and often followed by the same results, to wit, a blemish\r\nwhich may not only subject the animal to a suspicion of unsoundness, but\r\nin some special circumstances may interfere with his ability to labor.\r\nIt is known as \"interfering\" when the location of the trouble is the\r\ninside of the fetlock of either the fore or hind leg. It is called\r\n\"speedy cut\" when it occurs on the inside of the fore leg, a little\r\nbelow the knee, at the point of contact of that joint with the cannon.\r\nIt is always the result of a blow, self-inflicted, of varying severity,\r\nand giving rise to various lesions. (See also p. 399.)\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--At times the injury is too slight to be seriously noticed,\r\nthe hair being scarcely cut and the skin unmarked. At other times the\r\nskin will be cut through, partly or wholly, and it may for the time\r\ncause sufficient pain to check the motion of the animal and induce him\r\nto suspend his labor through his inability to use the wounded limb,\r\ntraveling meanwhile for a short space on three legs only. Sometimes a\r\nsingle blow will suffice, or again there will be a repetition of lighter\r\nstrokes. In the latter case the parts will become much swollen, hot, and\r\nso painful to the touch that the motion of the knee or the fetlock will\r\nbe sufficiently disturbed to cause lameness of a degree of severity\r\ncorresponding to that of the lesion. Following the subsidence of this\r\ndiffused and edematous swelling is sometimes the formation of a tumor,\r\neither at the knee or the fetlock. This may be soft at first or become\r\nso by degrees, with fluctuation, its contents being at first\r\nextravasated blood, and later a serosity; or, if there has been a\r\nsufficient degree of inflammation, it may become suppurative. The result\r\nof the fault of interfering may thus be exhibited, whether at the knee\r\nor at the fetlock, as characterized by all the pathological conditions\r\nwhich have appeared as accompaniments of capped knee or capped hock. If,\r\nin consequence of the force of the blow or blows, the inflammation has\r\nbeen usually severe, a mortification of the skin may become one of the\r\nconsequences, a slough taking-place, succeeded by a cutaneous ulcer on\r\nthe inside of the fetlock or when the greater number of the original\r\nwounds are inflicted. If the interfering has been often repeated it may\r\nbe followed by another condition, which has been considered in our\r\nremarks upon other affections. It is a plastic exudation or thickening\r\nof the parts, which are commonly said to have become \"callous,\" and the\r\neffect of it is to destroy the regularity of the outlines of the joint\r\nto an extent which constitutes a serious blemish, which will be\r\npermanent, and according to the degree of the aberration from the\r\nnatural and symmetrical lines will inevitably depreciate the commercial\r\nvalue of the animal.\r\n\r\nAn animal in interfering may thus exhibit a range of symptoms which from\r\nthe simplest form of a mere \"touching,\" may successively assume the\r\nserious characters of an ugly cicatrix, a hard, plastic swelling, or\r\nperhaps, as witnessed at the knee, of periostitis with its sequelae.\r\n\r\nIf a single and constantly recurring cause--a blow--is the starting\r\npoint in interfering, we may now consider the subject of the\r\npredisposition which brings such serious results upon the suffering\r\nanimal, and the conditions which lead to and accompany it. These are\r\nnumerous, but the first in frequency and importance is peculiarity of\r\nconformation in the animals addicted to it. The first class will include\r\nhorses, whose chests are narrow and whose legs do not stand straight and\r\nupright, but are crooked and pigeon-toed in and out. The second class\r\nincludes those whose legs are weak, either from youth or hard labor, or\r\nfrom severe attacks of sickness. Another class is made up of those\r\nhaving abnormally developed feet, or which have been badly shod with\r\nunnecessarily wide or heavy shoes. Another class consists of those that\r\nare affected with swollen fetlocks or chronic, edematous swelling of the\r\nleg. Another is formed of animals with a peculiar action, as those whose\r\nknee action is very high, and it is these that furnish most of the cases\r\nof speedy cut.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis._--The prognosis of interfering is never a very serious one.\r\nHowever violent the blow may be it is rarely that subsequent\r\ncomplications of a troublesome nature occur. The principal evil\r\nattending it is a liability to be followed by a thickened or callous\r\ndeposit which is not only an eyesore and a blemish, but constitutes a\r\nnew and increased predisposition. The remark that \"an animal which has\r\ninterfered once is always liable to interfere,\" is often confirmed and\r\nsanctioned by a recurrence of the trouble.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Another point in which there is a resemblance between this\r\nlesion and others which we have considered is in its responsiveness to\r\nthe same treatment with them. Indeed, the prescription of warm\r\nfomentations, soothing applications, and astringent and resolvent\r\nmixtures, in a majority of cases, is the first that occurs all through\r\nthe list. If the swelling assumes the character of a serous collection,\r\npressure, cold water, and bandages will contribute to its removal. If\r\nsuppuration seems to be established and the swelling assumes the\r\ncharacter of a developing abscess, hot poultices of flaxseed or of\r\nboiled vegetables and the embrocations of sedative ointments, those of\r\nbasilicon, or vaseline, impregnated with preparations of opium or\r\nbelladonna--all these recommend themselves by their general adaptation\r\nand the beneficial results which have followed their administration, not\r\nless in one case than in another. When an abscess has formed and is\r\nfluctuating, it should be carefully but fully opened to evacuate the\r\npus. If it is a serous cyst, some care is necessary in emptying it, and\r\nthe possibility of the extension of the inflammation to the joint must\r\nbe taken into consideration. When the cavities have been emptied and\r\nhave closed by filling up with granulations, or if, not being opened,\r\nthe contents have been reabsorbed, and there remains in either case a\r\nplastic exudation and a tendency to the callous organization that may\r\nyet exist, blisters under their various forms, including those of\r\ncantharides, of mercury, and of iodin, are then indicated, principally\r\nin the early stages, as it is then that their effects will prove most\r\nsatisfactory. The use of the actual cautery, with fine points,\r\npenetrating deeply throughout the enlargement, has in our hands, when\r\nused in the very early stages of its formation, nearly always brought on\r\na radical recovery with complete absorption of the thickening.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRINGHALT.\r\n\r\nThis is an involuntary movement of one or both hind legs, in which the\r\nfoot is suddenly and spasmodically lifted from the ground much higher\r\nthan it is normally carried, with excessive flexion of one bone upon the\r\nother. This peculiarity is usually prominent, although it may disappear\r\nwith work, only to reappear after a short rest. Sometimes it is most\r\napparent at a trot, sometimes at a walk, and other times only when\r\nturned around; or it may not be affected by the gait of the horse. It\r\ndoes not seem to be influenced by the horse's age, young and old being\r\nalike affected. Its first manifestations are sometimes very slight. It\r\nhas been noticed as occurring in an animal when backing out of his\r\nstable and ceasing immediately after. In some animals it is best seen\r\nwhen the animal is turning around on the affected leg, and it is not\r\nnoticed when he moves straight forward. That this peculiar action\r\ninterferes with facility of locomotion and detracts from a horse's claim\r\nto soundness can not for a moment be denied.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--Veterinarians and pathologists are yet in doubt in respect to\r\nthe cause of this affection, as well as to its essential nature. Whether\r\nit results from disease of the hock, of an ulcerative character; whether\r\nit springs from a malformation; whether it is a shortening of the\r\nligaments, a chronic inflammation of the sciatic nerve, or a disease of\r\nthe spinal cord; whether it is purely a muscular or purely a nervous\r\nlesion, or a compound of both--it still continues, if an etiologist is\r\nbound to possess universal knowledge within the scope of his special\r\nstudies, to be his reproach and his puzzle.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--When there is a known or suspected cause the treatment\r\nshould be directed toward this factor. If due to local inflammation of\r\nthe hock or foot, only this local lesion should be treated. If it\r\nremains after the local lesion has healed, or if we have no assignable\r\ncause, the best results have followed the sectioning of the lateral\r\nextensor of the foot. A competent veterinarian alone should undertake\r\nthis operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHROMBOSIS.\r\n\r\nThere are certain forms of lameness which are very peculiar in their\r\nmanifestation, and which to the nonprofessional mind must appear to\r\nbelong to the domain of mystery or theory instead of occupying a\r\nwell-established position among the subjects of equine pathology. Yet\r\nthey are no less susceptible of actual demonstration and of positive\r\ncomprehension than many facts which, plain and familiar to the general\r\nunderstanding now, were once ranked among things occult and\r\nunsearchable. A thrombus, considered as a cause of lameness, may find a\r\nplace among these understood mysteries.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--Under certain peculiar conditions of inflammation of the blood\r\nvessels, and also in aneurisms, clots of blood are sometimes formed in\r\nthe arteries and find their way in the general circulation. At first,\r\nwhile very small, or sufficiently so to pass from one vessel to another,\r\nthey move from a small vessel to a larger, and from that to one still\r\nlarger, constantly increasing in size until at some given point, from\r\ntheir inability to enter smaller vessels, their movement is finally\r\narrested. The artery is thus effectually dammed, and the clot in a short\r\ntime cuts off completely the supply of blood from the parts beyond. This\r\nis thrombosis, and it often gives rise to sudden and excessive lameness\r\nof a very painful character.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Thrombi may form in any of the arteries, and doubtless have\r\nbeen the cause of many cases of lameness which could never be accounted\r\nfor. If they exist in small arteries their diagnosis will probably fail\r\nto be made out with certainty, but when situated in the larger trunks a\r\nstrong suspicion of their presence may be excited. In some cases they\r\nmay even be recognized with positive accuracy, as when the vessels which\r\nsupply the posterior extremities are affected by the blocking up of the\r\nposterior aorta or its ramifications.\r\n\r\nThe existence of thrombosis of the arteries of the hind leg may always\r\nbe suspected when the following history is known: The general health of\r\nthe animal is good, but symptoms of lameness in one of the legs have\r\nbeen developed, becoming more marked as he is worked, and especially\r\nwhen driven at a fast gait. But the disturbance is not permanent, and\r\nthe lameness disappears almost immediately after a rest. There is an\r\nincrease of the difficulty, however, and, though the animal may walk\r\nnormally, he will, when made to trot, very soon begin to slacken his\r\npace and to show signs of the trouble, and if urged to increase his\r\nspeed will become lamer and lamer; an abundant perspiration will break\r\nout; he will refuse to go, and if forced he shows weakness behind, seems\r\nready to fall, and perhaps does fall. While on his feet the leg is kept\r\nin constant motion, up and down, and is kept from the ground as if the\r\ncontact were too painful to bear. If undisturbed this series of symptoms\r\nwill gradually subside, sometimes very soon, and occasionally after a\r\nfew hours he will return to an apparently perfect condition. A return\r\nto labor will lead to a renewal of the same incidents.\r\n\r\nA history like this suggests a strong suspicion of a thrombus in an\r\nartery of the hind leg, and this suspicion will be confirmed by the\r\nexternal symptoms exhibited by the animal. The total absence of any\r\nother disease which might account for the lameness, and a manifest\r\ndiminution of heat over a part or the whole of the extremity, when\r\ncompared with the opposite side or with any other portion of the body; a\r\nsensation of cold attendant on the pain, but gradually subsiding as the\r\npain subsides, and the circulation, quickened by the rest, has been\r\nreestablished throughout the extremity; all these are confirmatory\r\ncircumstances. Still, it is thus far only a suspicion, and absolute\r\ncertainty is yet wanting. To establish the truth of the case the rectal\r\nexploration must be resorted to. The hands then, well prepared and\r\ncarefully introduced into the rectum, must explore for the truth, first\r\nfeeling for the large blood vessels which, divided at the aorta,\r\nseparate to supply the right and left legs. These must be compared in\r\nrespect to the pulsation and other particulars. The artery which is\r\nhealthy will, of course, exhibit all the proper conditions of that\r\nstate. On the other hand, if the vessel appears to the feel hard, more\r\nor less cordy, and pulseless, or giving a sensation of fluttering, as of\r\na small volume of blood with a trickling motion passing through a\r\nconfined space, the difference between the sides will make the case\r\nplain. The first will be the full flow of the circulation through an\r\nunobstructed channel, the other a forced passage of the fluid between\r\nthe thrombus and the coats of the artery. In such case the prognosis is\r\nnecessarily a grave one and the disease is more liable to grow Worse\r\nthan better.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--No form of treatment can be advised; the suffering or a\r\nhelpless and useless animal can only be terminated by that which ends\r\nall.\r\n\r\nCases occur, however, where this condition of the blood vessels exists\r\nin a much less degree, and the diseased condition is not sufficiently\r\npronounced for final condemnation. There may even be a possibility of\r\nthe absorption of the clot, or that an increase of the collateral\r\ncirculation may be sufficient to supply the parts with blood. In such\r\ncases spontaneous recovery may follow moderate exercise in the pasture,\r\nfield, or stable, or continuous light work may be given, but too much\r\nhope should not be placed in such treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRAINS OF THE LOINS.\r\n\r\nThis is an affection which suggests to the mind the idea of muscular\r\ninjury, and is difficult to distinguish from many similar cases. If the\r\nanimal shrinks from the slightest pressure or pinching of the spine in\r\nthe region of the loins, he is by many pronounced to be \"lame in the\r\nloins,\" or \"sprained in the loins,\" or \"weak in the kidneys.\" This is a\r\ngrave error, as in fact this simple and gentle yielding to such a\r\npressure is not a pathological sign, but is normal and significant of\r\nhealth. Yet there are several conditions to which the definition of\r\n\"sprains of the loins\" may apply which are not strictly normal.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--The muscles of the back and those of the loins proper, as the\r\npsoas, may have been injured, or again there may be trouble of a\r\nrheumatic nature, perhaps suggestive of lumbago. Diseases of the bones\r\nof the vertebral column, or even those of the organs of circulation, may\r\ngive rise to an exhibition of similar symptoms.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are characteristic of a loss of rigidity or\r\nfirmness of the vertebral column, both when the animal is at rest and in\r\naction. In the former condition, or when at rest, there is an arched\r\ncondition of the back and a constrained posture in standing, with the\r\nhind legs separated. In the latter there is a lateral, balancing\r\nmovement at the loins, principally noticeable while the animal is in the\r\nact of trotting--a peculiar motion, sometimes referred to as a \"crick in\r\nthe back,\" or what the French call a \"tour de bateau.\" If, while in\r\naction, the animal is suddenly made to halt, the act is accompanied with\r\nmuch pain, the back suddenly arching or bending laterally, and perhaps\r\nthe hind legs thrown under the body, as if unable to perform their\r\nfunctions in stopping, and sometimes it is only accomplished at the cost\r\nof a sudden and severe fall. This manifestation is also exhibited when\r\nthe animal is called upon to back, when a repetition of the same\r\nsymptoms will also occur.\r\n\r\nIf a slight pressure on the back or the loins is followed by a moderate\r\nyielding of the animal, it is, as before remarked, a good sign of\r\nhealth. With a sprain of the loins pressure of any kind is painful, and\r\nwill cause the animal to bend or to crouch under it more or less,\r\naccording to the weight of the pressure. Heavy loads, and even heavy\r\nharnessing, will develop this tenderness. In lying down he seems to\r\nsuffer much discomfort, and often accompanies the act with groaning, and\r\nwhen compelled to rise does so only with great difficulty and seldom\r\nsucceeds without repeated efforts.\r\n\r\nSprains of muscles proper, when recent, will always be accompanied with\r\nthis series of symptoms, and the fact of their exhibition, with an\r\nexcessive sensibility of the parts, and possibly with a degree of\r\nswelling, will always justify a diagnosis of acute muscular lesion, and\r\nespecially so if accompanied with a history of violent efforts, powerful\r\nmuscular strains, falls, heavy loading, etc., connected with the case.\r\nIf the symptoms have been of slow development and gradual increase, it\r\nbecomes a more difficult task to determine whether the diagnosis points\r\nto pathological changes in the structure of the muscles or of the bones,\r\nthe nervous centers, or the blood vessels of the region. And yet it is\r\nimportant to decide as to which particular structure is affected in\r\nreference to the question of prognosis, as the degree of gravity of the\r\nlesion will depend largely upon whether the disabled condition of the\r\nanimal is due to an acute or a chronic disease.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The prescription which will necessarily first of all\r\nsuggest itself for sprains of the loins is rest. An animal so affected\r\nshould be immediately placed in slings, and none of his efforts to\r\nrelease himself should be allowed to succeed. Hot compresses, cold-water\r\ndouches, sweating applications, stimulating frictions, strengthening\r\ncharges, blistering ointments of cantharides and the actual cautery, all\r\nhave their advocates, but in no case can the immobility obtained by the\r\nslings be dispensed with. In many cases in which the weakness of the\r\nhind quarters was caused by disease of the nervous centers electricity\r\nhas also yielded good results.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] This bandage consists of a cloth drenched in warm water or a\r\ndripping bandage laid around the diseased part, then covered by several\r\nlayers of woolen blanket or cloth, which is in turn covered by parchment\r\npaper, rubber cloth, or other impervious material. Heat, moisture, and\r\npressure are obtained by such a bandage if water is poured upon it\r\nseveral times daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE FETLOCK, ANKLE, AND FOOT.\r\n\r\nBy A. A. HOLCOMBE, D. V. S.,\r\n\r\n_Veterinary Inspector, Bureau of Animal Industry._\r\n\r\n\r\nANATOMICAL REVIEW OF THE FOOT.\r\n\r\nIn a description of the foot of the horse it is customary to include\r\nonly the hoof and its contents, yet, from a zoological standpoint, the\r\nfoot includes all the leg from the knee and the hock down.\r\n\r\nThe foot of the horse is undoubtedly the most important part of the\r\nanimal, so far as veterinary surgery is concerned, for the reason that\r\nit is subject to so many injuries and diseases which in part or in whole\r\nrender the patient unfit for the labor demanded of him. The old aphorism\r\n\"no foot no horse\" is as true to-day as when first expressed; in fact,\r\ndomestication, coupled with the multiplied uses to which the animal is\r\nput, and the constant reproduction of hereditary defects and tendencies,\r\nhas largely transformed the ancient \"companion of the wind\" into a very\r\ncommon piece of machinery which is often out of repair, and at best is\r\nbut shortlived in its usefulness.\r\n\r\nSince the value of the horse depends largely or even entirely upon his\r\nability to labor, it is essential that his organs of locomotion be kept\r\nsound. To accomplish this end it is necessary not only to know how to\r\ncure all diseases to which these organs are liable but, better still,\r\nhow to prevent them.\r\n\r\nAn important prerequisite to the detection and cure of disease is a\r\nknowledge of the construction and function of the parts which may be\r\ninvolved in the diseased process. Hence, first of all, the anatomical\r\nstructures must be understood. (See also p. 583.)\r\n\r\nThe bones of the fetlock and foot constitute the skeleton on which the\r\nother structures are built and comprise the lower end of the cannon bone\r\n(the metacarpus in the fore leg, the metatarsus in the hind leg), the\r\ntwo sesamoids, the large pastern or os suffraginis, the small pastern or\r\ncoronet, the small sesamoid or navicular bone, and the coffin bone or os\r\npedis. (Plate XXXIV, fig. 3.)\r\n\r\nThe cannon bone extends from the knee or hock to the fetlock, is\r\ncylindrical in shape, and stands nearly or quite perpendicular.\r\n\r\nThe sesamoids occur in pairs, are small, shaped like a three-faced\r\npyramid, and are set behind the fetlock joint, at the upper end of the\r\nlarge pastern, with the base of the pyramid down.\r\n\r\nThe large pastern is a very compact bone, set in an oblique direction\r\ndownward and forward, and extends from the cannon bone to the coronet.\r\n\r\nThe coronet is a short, cube-shaped bone, set between the large pastern\r\nand coffin bone, in the same oblique direction.\r\n\r\nThe navicular bone is short, flattened above and below, and is attached\r\nto the coffin bone behind.\r\n\r\nThe coffin bone forms the end of the foot and is shaped like the horny\r\nbox in which it is inclosed.\r\n\r\nAll these bones are covered on the surfaces which go to make up the\r\njoints with a cartilage of incrustation, while the portions between are\r\ncovered with a fibrous membrane called the periosteum.\r\n\r\nThe joints of the legs are of especial importance, since any\r\ninterference with their function very largely impairs the value of the\r\nanimal for most purposes. As the joints of the foot and ankle are at the\r\npoint of greatest concussion they are the ones most subject to injury\r\nand disease.\r\n\r\nThere are three of these joints--the fetlock, pastern, and coffin. They\r\nare made by the union of two or more bones, held together by ligaments\r\nof fibrous tissue, and are lubricated by a thick, viscid fluid, called\r\nsynovia, which is secreted by a special membrane inclosing the joints.\r\n\r\nThe fetlock joint is made by the union of the lower end of the cannon\r\nand the upper end of the large pastern bones, supplemented by the two\r\nsesamoids, so placed behind the upper end of the pastern that the joint\r\nis capable of a very extensive motion. These bones are held together by\r\nligaments, only one of which--the suspensory--demands special mention.\r\n\r\nThe suspensory ligament of the fetlock starts from the knee, extends\r\ndown behind the cannon, lying behind the two splint bones, until near\r\nthe fetlock, where it divides and sends a branch on each side of the\r\njoint, downward and forward, to become attached on the sides of the\r\nextensor tendon at the lower end of the pastern bone. As it crosses the\r\nsesamoids, on the posterior borders of the fetlock, it throws out fibers\r\nwhich hold it fast to these bones. (Plate XXXIV, fig. 2.)\r\n\r\nThe pastern joint is made by the union of the two pastern bones.\r\n\r\nThe coffin joint is made by the union of the small pastern, coffin, and\r\nsmall sesamoid, or navicular bones, the latter being set behind and\r\nbeneath the joint surface of the coffin bone in such way as to receive\r\nlargely the weight of the small pastern.\r\n\r\nThree tendons serve to move the bones of the foot one on another. Two of\r\nthese flex, or bend, the joints, while the other extends, or\r\nstraightens, the column of bones. (Plate XXXIII, fig. 5.)\r\n\r\nThe flexor pedis perforans, or deep flexor of the foot, passes down\r\nbehind the cannon bone, lying against the suspensory ligament in front,\r\ncrosses the fetlock joint in the groove made by the union of the two\r\nsesamoids, and is attached to the bottom on the coffin bone, after\r\ncovering the navicular, by a wide expansion of its fibers. It is the\r\nfunction of this tendon to flex the coffin bone and, with it, the horny\r\nbox.\r\n\r\nThe flexor pedis perforatus, or superficial flexor of the foot, follows\r\nthe course of the preceding tendon and is attached to the middle of the\r\nankle. The function of this tendon is to flex the foot at the fetlock.\r\n\r\nThe extensor pedis runs down in front of the leg, is attached on the\r\nmost prominent point of the coffin bone, and has for function the\r\nstraightening of the bones of the ankle and foot.\r\n\r\nThe bones, ligaments, and tendons are covered by a loose connective\r\ntissue, which gives a symmetry to the parts by filling up and rounding\r\noff, and all are protected by the skin and hoof.\r\n\r\nThe skin of the fetlock and ankle is generally characterized by its\r\nthickness and the length of its hairs, especially around the hind parts\r\nof the fetlock joint in certain breeds of horses. The most important\r\npart of this envelope is that known as the coronary band.\r\n\r\nThe coronary band is that portion of the skin which secretes the horn of\r\nwhich the wall of the hoof is made. This horn much resembles the nail\r\nwhich grows on the fingers and toes of man. It is composed of\r\ncylindrical tubes, which are held together by a tenacious, opaque\r\nmatter. The horn extends from the coronary band to the lower border of\r\nthe hoof. (Plate XXXII, fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nThe hoof is a box of horn, consisting of a wall, sole, and frog, and\r\ncontains, besides the coffin, navicular, and part of the small pastern\r\nbones, the sensitive laminae, plantar cushion, and the lateral\r\ncartilages. (Plate XXXIII, fig. 4.)\r\n\r\nThe sole of the foot incloses the box on the ground surface, is shaped\r\nlike the circumference of the foot, except that a V-shaped opening is\r\nleft behind for the reception of the frog, and is concave on the lower\r\nsurface. The sole is produced by the velvety tissue, a thin membrane\r\ncovering the plantar cushion and other soft tissues beneath the coffin\r\nbone. The horn of the sole differs from the horn of the wall in that its\r\ntubes are not straight and from the fact that it scales off in pieces\r\nover the whole surface.\r\n\r\nThe frog is a triangular-shaped body, divided into two equal parts by a\r\ndeep fissure, extending from its apex in front to the base. It fills the\r\ntriangular space in the sole, to which it is intimately attached by its\r\nborders. The horn of the frog is produced in the same manner as the\r\nsole; but it differs from both the wall and sole in that the horn is\r\nsoft, moist, and elastic to a remarkable degree. It is the function of\r\nthe frog to destroy shock and to prevent slipping.\r\n\r\nThe sensitive laminae are thin plates of soft tissue covering the entire\r\nanterior surface of the coffin bone. They are present in great numbers,\r\nand by fitting into corresponding grooves on the inner surface of the\r\nhorn of the wall the union of the soft and horny tissues is made\r\ncomplete. (Plate XXXII, fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nThe plantar cushion is a thick pad of fibrous tissue placed behind and\r\nunder the navicular and coffin bones and resting on the sole and frog,\r\nfor the purpose of receiving the downward pressure of the column of\r\nbones and to destroy shock. (Plate XXXII, fig. 4.)\r\n\r\nThe lateral cartilages are attached, one on each side, to the wings of\r\nthe coffin bone by their inferior borders. They are thin plates of\r\nfibro-cartilage, and their function is to assist the frog and adjacent\r\nstructures to regain their proper position after having been displaced\r\nby the weight of the body while the foot rested on the ground. (Plate\r\nXXXII, fig. 2.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAULTS OF CONFORMATION.\r\n\r\nA large percentage of horses have feet which are not perfect in\r\nconformation, and as a consequence they are especially predisposed to\r\ncertain injuries and diseases.\r\n\r\n_Flatfoot_ is that condition in which the sole has little or no\r\nconvexity. It is a peculiarity common to some breeds, especially heavy,\r\nlymphatic animals raised on low, marshy soils. It is confined to the\r\nfore feet, which are generally broad, low-heeled, and with a wall less\r\nupright than is seen in the perfect foot.\r\n\r\nIn flatfoot there can be little or no elasticity in the sole, for the\r\nreason that it has no arch, and the weight of the animal is received on\r\nhe entire plantar surface, as it rests upon the ground instead of on the\r\nwall. For these reasons such feet are particularly liable to bruises of\r\nthe sole, corns, pumiced sole, and excessive suppuration when the\r\nprocess is once established. Horses with flatfoot should be shod with a\r\nshoe having a wide web, pressing on the wall only, while the heels and\r\nfrog are never to be pared. Flatfoot generally has weak walls, and as a\r\nconsequence the nails of the shoe are readily loosened and the shoe\r\ncast.\r\n\r\n_Clubfoot_ is a term applied to such feet as have the walls set nearly\r\nperpendicular. When this condition is present the heels are high, the\r\nfetlock joint is thrown forward, or knuckles, and the weight of the\r\nanimal is received on the toes. Many mules are clubfooted, especially\r\nbehind, where it seems to cause little or no inconvenience. Severe cases\r\nof clubfoot may be cured by cutting the tendons, but as a rule special\r\nshoeing is the only measure of relief that can be adopted. The toe\r\nshould not be pared, but the heels are to be lowered as much as\r\npossible and a shoe put on with a long, projecting toe piece, slightly\r\nturned up, while the heels of the shoe are to be made thin.\r\n\r\n_Crookedfoot_ is that condition in which one side of the wall is higher\r\nthan the other. If the inside wall is the higher, the ankle is thrown\r\noutward, so that the fetlock joints are abnormally wide apart and the\r\ntoes close together. Animals with this deformity are \"pigeon-toed,\" and\r\nare prone to interfere, the inside toe striking the opposite fetlock. If\r\nbut one foot is affected, the liability to interfere is still greater,\r\nfor the reason that the fetlock of the perfect leg is nearer the center\r\nplane.\r\n\r\nWhen the outside heel is the higher the ankle is thrown in and the toe\r\nturns out. Horses with such feet interfere with the heel. If but one\r\nfoot is so affected, the liability to interfere is less than when both\r\nfeet are affected, for the reason that the ankle of the perfect leg is\r\nnot so near to the center plane. Such animals are especially liable to\r\nstumbling and to lameness from injury to the ligaments of the fetlock\r\njoints. This deformity is to be overcome by such shoeing as will\r\nequalize the disparity in length of walls, and by proper boots to\r\nprotect the fetlocks from interfering.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERFERING.\r\n\r\nAn animal is said to interfere when one foot strikes the opposite leg,\r\nas it passes by, during locomotion. The inner surface of the fetlock\r\njoint is the part most subject to this injury, although, under certain\r\nconditions, it may happen to any part of the ankle. It is seen more\r\noften in the hind than in the fore legs. Interfering causes a bruise of\r\nthe skin and deeper tissues, generally accompanied with an abrasion of\r\nthe surface. It may cause lameness, dangerous tripping, and thickening\r\nof the injured parts. (See also p. 387.)\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Faulty conformation is the most prolific cause of\r\ninterfering. When the bones of the leg are so united that the toe of the\r\nfoot turns in (pigeon-toed), or when the fetlock joints are close\r\ntogether and the toe turns out, when the leg is so deformed that the\r\nwhole foot and ankle turn either in or out, interfering is almost sure\r\nto follow. It may happen, also, when the feet grow too long, from\r\ndefective shoeing, rough or slippery roads, from the exhaustion of labor\r\nor sickness, swelling of the leg, high knee action, fast work, and\r\nbecause the chest or hips are too narrow.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Generally, the evidences of interfering are easily\r\ndetected, for the parts are tender, swollen, and the skin broken. But\r\nvery often, especially in trotters, the flat surface of the hoof strikes\r\nthe fetlock without evident injury, and attention is directed to these\r\nparts only by the occasional tripping and unsteady gait. In such cases\r\nproof of the cause may be had by walking and trotting the animal, after\r\nfirst painting the inside toe and quarter of the suspected foot with a\r\nthin coating of chalk, charcoal, mud, or paint.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--When the trouble is due to deformity or faulty\r\nconformation it may not be possible to overcome the defect.\r\n\r\nIn such cases, and as well in those due to exhaustion or fatigue, the\r\nfetlock or ankle boot must be used. In many instances interfering may be\r\nprevented by proper shoeing. The outside heel and quarter of the foot on\r\nthe injured leg should be lowered sufficiently to change the relative\r\nposition of the fetlock joint by bringing it farther away from the\r\ncenter plane of the body, thereby permitting the other foot to pass by\r\nwithout striking.\r\n\r\nA very slight change is often sufficient to effect this result. At the\r\nsame time the offending foot should be so shod that the shoe may set\r\nwell under the hoof at the point responsible for the injury. The shoe\r\nshould be reset every three or four weeks.\r\n\r\nWhen the cause has been removed, cold-water bandages to the injured\r\nparts will soon remove the soreness and swelling, especially in recent\r\ncases. If, however, the fetlock has become calloused from long-continued\r\nbruising, a Spanish-fly blister over the parts, repeated in two or three\r\nweeks if necessary, will aid in reducing the leg to its natural\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\r\nKNUCKLING, OR COCKED ANKLES.\r\n\r\nKnuckling is a partial dislocation of the fetlock joint, in which the\r\nrelative position of the pastern bone to the cannon and coronet bones is\r\nchanged, the pastern becoming more nearly perpendicular, with the lower\r\nend of the cannon bone resting behind the center line of the large\r\npastern, while the lower end of this bone rests behind the center line\r\nof the coronet. While knuckling is not always an unsoundness, it\r\nnevertheless predisposes to stumbling and to fracture of the pastern.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Young foals are quite subject to this condition, but in the\r\ngreat majority of cases it is only temporary. It is largely due to the\r\nfact that before birth the legs were flexed, and time is required after\r\nbirth for the ligaments, tendons, and muscles to adapt themselves to the\r\nfunction of sustaining the weight of the body.\r\n\r\nAs they grow old, horses with erect pasterns are very prone to knuckle,\r\nespecially in the hind legs. All kinds of heavy work, particularly in\r\nhilly districts, and fast work on hard race tracks or roads are exciting\r\ncauses of knuckling. It is also commonly seen as an accompaniment of\r\nthat faulty conformation called clubfoot, in which the toe of the wall\r\nis perpendicular and short, and the heels high--a condition most often\r\nseen in the mule, especially in the hind feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXII.\r\n\r\nANATOMY OF FOOT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXIII.\r\n\r\nANATOMY OF FOOT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXIV.\r\n\r\nANATOMY AND DISEASES OF THE FOOT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXV.\r\n\r\nSOUND AND CONTRACTED FEET.]\r\n\r\nLastly, knuckling is produced by disease of the suspensory ligament or\r\nof the flexor tendons, whereby they are shortened, and by disease of the\r\nfetlock joints. (See p. 372.)\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In young foals no treatment is necessary, unless there is\r\nsome deformity present, since the legs straighten up without\r\ninterference in the course of a few weeks. When knuckling has commenced,\r\nthe indications are to relieve the tendons and ligaments by proper\r\nshoeing. The foot is to be prepared for the shoe by shortening the toe\r\nas much as possible, leaving the heels high; or if the foot is prepared\r\nin the usual way the shoe should be thin in front, with thick heels or\r\nhigh calks. For the hind feet a long-heeled shoe with calks seems to do\r\nbest. Of course, when possible, the causes of knuckling are to be\r\nremoved; since this can not always be done, however, the time may come\r\nwhen the patient can no longer perform any service, particularly in\r\nthose cases in which both fore legs are affected, and it becomes\r\nnecessary either to destroy the animal or obtain relief by surgical\r\ninterference. In such cases the tendons between the fetlock and knee may\r\nbe divided for the purpose of obtaining temporary relief. Firing and\r\nblistering the parts responsible for the knuckling may, in some\r\ninstances, effect a cure; but a consideration of these measures belongs\r\nproperly to the treatment of the disease in which knuckling appears\r\nsimply as a sequel.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINDGALL.\r\n\r\nJoints and tendons are furnished with sacs containing a lubricating\r\nfluid called synovia. When these sacs are overdistended by reason of an\r\nexcessive secretion of synovia, they are called windgalls. They form a\r\nsoft, puffy tumor about the size of a hickory nut, and are most often\r\nfound in the fore leg, at the upper part of the fetlock joint, between\r\nthe tendon and the shin bone. When they develop in the hind leg it is\r\nnot unusual to see them reach the size of a walnut. Occasionally they\r\nappear in front of the fetlock on the border of the tendon. The majority\r\nof horses are not subject to them after colt-hood has passed. (See also\r\np. 355.)\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Windgalls are often seen in young, overgrown horses, in which\r\nthe body seems to have outgrown the ability of the joints to sustain the\r\nweight. In cart and other horses used to hard work, in trotters with\r\nexcessive knee action, in hurdle racers and hunters, and in most cow\r\nponies there is a predisposition to windgalls. Street-car horses and\r\nothers used to start heavy loads on slippery streets are the ones most\r\nliable to develop windgalls in the hind legs.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The tumor is more or less firm and tense when the foot is\r\non the ground, but is soft and compressible when the foot is off the\r\nground. In old horses windgalls generally develop slowly and cause no\r\ninconvenience. If they are caused by excessive tension of the joint the\r\ntumor develops rapidly, is tense, hot, and painful, and the animal is\r\nexceedingly lame. The patient stands with the joint flexed, and walks\r\nwith short steps, the toe only being placed on the ground. When the\r\ntumor is large and situated upon the inside of the leg it may be injured\r\nby interfering, causing stumbling and inflammation of the sac. Rest\r\ngenerally causes the tumor to diminish in size, only to fill up again\r\nafter renewed labor. In old cases the tumors are hardened, and may\r\nbecome converted into bone by a deposit of the lime salts.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The large, puffy joints of suckling colts, as a rule,\r\nrequire no treatment, for as the animal grows older the parts clean up\r\nand after a time the swelling entirely disappears.\r\n\r\nWhen the trouble is from an injury, complete rest is to be obtained by\r\nthe use of slings and a high-heeled shoe. Cold-water douches should be\r\nused once or twice a day, followed by cold-water bandages, until the\r\nfever has subsided and the soreness is largely removed, when a blister\r\nis to be applied.\r\n\r\nIn old windgalls, which cause more or less stiffness, some relief may be\r\nhad by the use of cold-compress bandages, elastic boots, or the red\r\niodid of mercury blisters. Opening the sacs, as recommended by some\r\nauthors, is of doubtful utility, and should be adopted only by the\r\nsurgeon capable of treating the wound he has made. Enforced rest until\r\ncomplete recovery is effected should always be insisted upon, since a\r\ntoo early return to work is sure to be followed by relapse.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRAIN OF THE FETLOCK.\r\n\r\nSprain of the fetlock joint is most common in the fore legs, and, as a\r\nrule, affects but one at a time. Horses doing fast work, as trotters,\r\nrunners, steeplechasers, hunters, cow ponies, and those that interfere,\r\nare particularly liable to this injury.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Horses knuckling at the fetlock, and all those with diseases\r\nwhich impair the powers of locomotion, such as navicular disease,\r\ncontracted heels, sidebones, chronic laminitis, etc., are predisposed to\r\nsprains of the fetlock. It generally happens from a misstep, stumbling,\r\nor slipping, which results in the joint being extended or flexed to\r\nexcess. The same result may happen where the foot is caught in a rut, a\r\nhole in a bridge, or in a car track, and the animal falls or struggles\r\nviolently. Direct blows and punctured wounds may also set up\r\ninflammation of the joint.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms of sprain of the fetlock vary with the\r\nseverity of the injury. If slight, there may be no lameness, but simply\r\na little soreness, especially when the foot strikes on uneven ground and\r\nthe joint is twisted a little. In more severe cases the joint swells, is\r\nhot and puffy, and the lameness may be so intense as to compel the\r\nanimal to hobble on three legs. While at rest the leg is flexed at the\r\njoint affected, and the toe rests on the ground.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--If the injury is slight, cold-water bandages and a few\r\ndays' rest are sufficient to effect recovery. When there is an intense\r\nlameness, swelling, etc., the leg should be placed under a constant\r\nstream of cold water, as described in the treatment for quittor. When\r\nthe inflammation has subsided, a blister to the joint should be applied.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, especially in old horses long accustomed to fast work,\r\nthe ligaments of the joints are ruptured, in whole or in part, and the\r\nlameness may last a long time. In these cases the joint should be kept\r\ncompletely at rest; this condition is best obtained by the application\r\nof plaster of Paris bandages, as in cases of fracture. As a rule,\r\npatients take kindly to this bandage, and, while wearing it, may be\r\ngiven the freedom of a roomy box or yard. If they are disposed to tear\r\nit off, or if sufficient rest can not otherwise be obtained, the patient\r\nmust be kept in slings.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of instances the plaster bandage should remain on from\r\ntwo to four weeks. If the lameness returns when the bandage is removed,\r\na new one should be put on. The swellings which always remains after the\r\nother evidences of the disease have disappeared, may be largely\r\ndissipated and the joint strengthened by the rise of the firing iron and\r\nblisters.\r\n\r\nA joint once injured by a severe sprain never entirely regains its\r\noriginal strength, and is ever after particularly liable to a repetition\r\nof the injury.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUPTURE OF THE SUSPENSORY LIGAMENT.\r\n\r\nSprain with or without rupture of the suspensory ligament may happen in\r\neither the fore or hind legs, and is occasionally seen in horses of all\r\nclasses and at all ages. Old animals, however, and especially hunters,\r\nrunners, and trotters, are the most subject to this injury, and with\r\nthem the seat of the trouble is nearly always in one or both the fore\r\nlegs. Horses used for heavy draft are more liable to have the ligament\r\nof the hind legs affected.\r\n\r\nWhen the strain upon the suspensory ligament becomes too great, one or\r\nboth of the branches may be torn from the sesamoid bones, one or both of\r\nthe branches may be torn completely across, or the ligament may rupture\r\nabove the point of division.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The most common injury to the suspensory ligament is sprain\r\nof the internal branch in one of the fore legs. The trouble is indicated\r\nby lameness, heat, swelling, and tenderness of the affected branch,\r\nbeginning just above the sesamoid bone and extending obliquely downward\r\nand forward to the front of the ankle. If the whole ligament is\r\ninvolved, the swelling comes on gradually, and is found above the\r\nfetlock and in front of the flexor tendons. The patient stands or walks\r\nupon the toe as much as possible, keeping the fetlock joint flexed so as\r\nto relieve the ligament of tension.\r\n\r\nWhen both branches are torn from their attachments to the sesamoids, or\r\nboth are torn across, the lameness comes on suddenly and is most\r\nintense; the fetlock descends, the toe turns up, and, as the animal\r\nattempts to walk, the leg has the appearance of being broken off at the\r\nfetlock. These symptoms, followed by heat, pain, and swelling of the\r\nparts at the point of injury, will enable anyone to make a diagnosis.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Sprain of the suspensory ligament, no matter how mild it\r\nmay be, should always be treated by enforced rest of at least a month,\r\nand the application of cold douches and cold-water bandages, firmly\r\napplied until the fever has subsided, when a cantharides blister should\r\nbe put on and repeated in two or three weeks if necessary. When rupture\r\nhas taken place the patient should be put into slings and a constant\r\nstream of cold water allowed to trickle over the seat of injury until\r\nthe fever is reduced. In the course of a week or ten days a plaster of\r\nParis splint, such as is used in fractures, is to be applied and left on\r\nfor a month or six weeks. When this is taken off, blisters may be used\r\nto remove the remaining soreness; but it is useless to expect a removal\r\nof all the thickening, for, in the process of repair, new tissue has\r\nbeen formed which will always remain.\r\n\r\nIn old cases of sprain the firing iron may often be used with good\r\nresults. As a rule, severe injuries to the suspensory ligament\r\nincapacitate the subject for anything but slow, light work.\r\n\r\n\r\nOVERREACH.\r\n\r\nWhen the shoe of the hind foot strikes and injures the heel or quarter\r\nof the forefoot the horse is said to overreach. It rarely happens except\r\nwhen the animal is going fast; hence is most common in trotting and\r\nrunning horses. In trotters the accident generally happens when the\r\nanimal breaks from a trot to a run. The outside heels and quarters are\r\nmost liable to the injury.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The coronet at the heel or quarter is bruised or cut, the\r\ninjury in some instances involving the horn as well. When the hind foot\r\nstrikes well back on the heel of the fore foot--an accident known among\r\nhorsemen as \"grabbing\"--the shoe may be torn from the forefoot or the\r\nanimal may fall to its knees. Horses accustomed to overreaching are\r\noften \"bad breakers,\" for the reason that the pain of the injury so\r\nexcites them that they can not readily be brought back to the trotting\r\ngait.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--If the injury is but a slight bruise, cold-water bandages\r\napplied for a few days will remove all the soreness. If the parts are\r\ndeeply cut, more or less suppuration will follow, and, as a rule, it is\r\nwell to poultice the parts for a day or two, after which cold baths may\r\nbe used, or the wounds dressed with tincture of aloes, oakum, and a\r\nroller bandage.\r\n\r\nWhen an animal is known to be subject to overreaching, he should never\r\nbe driven fast without quarter boots, which are specially made for the\r\nprotection of the heels and quarters.\r\n\r\nIf there is a disposition to \"grab\" the forward shoes, the trouble may\r\nbe remedied by having the heels of these shoes made as short as\r\npossible, while the toe of the hind foot should project well over the\r\nshoe. When circumstances permit of their use, the fore feet may be shod\r\nwith the \"tips\" instead of the common shoe, as described in treatment\r\nfor contracted heels.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALK WOUNDS.\r\n\r\nHorses wearing shoes with sharp calks are liable to wounds of the\r\ncoronary region, either from trampling on themselves or on each other.\r\nThese injuries are most common in heavy draft horses, especially on\r\nrough roads and slippery streets. The fore feet are more liable than the\r\nhind ones, and the seat of injury is commonly on the quarters. In the\r\nhind feet the wound often results from the animal resting with the heel\r\nof one foot set directly over the front of the other. In these cases the\r\ninjury is generally close to the horn, and often involves the coronary\r\nband, the sensitive laminae, the extensor tendon, and even the coffin\r\nbone.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Preventive measures include the use of boots to protect\r\nthe coronet of the hind foot and of a blunt calk on the outside heel of\r\nthe fore shoe, since this is generally the offending instrument when the\r\nfore feet are injured. If the wound is not deep and the soreness slight,\r\ncold-water bandages and a light protective dressing, such as carbolized\r\ncosmoline, will be all that is needed. When the injury is deep, followed\r\nby inflammation and suppuration of the coronary band, lateral\r\ncartilages, sensitive laminae, etc., active measures must be resorted to.\r\nCold, astringent baths, made by adding 2 ounces of sulphate of iron to 1\r\ngallon of water, should be used, followed by poultices, if it is\r\nnecessary to hasten the cleansing of the wound by stimulating the\r\nsloughing process. If the wound is deep between the horn and the skin,\r\nespecially over the anterior tendon, the horn should be cut away so that\r\nthe injured tissues may be exposed. The subsequent treatment in these\r\ncases should follow the directions given in the article on toe cracks.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROSTBITES.\r\n\r\nExcepting the ears, the feet and legs are about the only parts of the\r\nhorse liable to become frostbitten. The cases most commonly seen are\r\nfound in cities, especially among car horses, where salt is used for the\r\npurpose of melting the snow on curves and switches. This mixture of\r\nsnow and salt is splashed over the feet and legs, rapidly lowering the\r\ntemperature of the parts to the freezing point. In mountainous\r\ndistricts, where the snowfall is heavy and the cold often intense,\r\nfrostbites are not uncommon, even among animals running at large.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--When the frosting is slight the skin becomes pale and\r\nbloodless, followed soon after by intense redness, heat, pain, and\r\nswelling. In these cases the hair may fall out and the epidermis peel\r\noff, but the inflammation soon subsides, the swelling disappears, and\r\nonly an increased sensitiveness to cold remains.\r\n\r\nIn more severe cases irregular patches of skin are destroyed and after a\r\nfew days slough away, leaving slow-healing ulcers behind. If produced by\r\nlow temperatures and deep snow, the coronary band is the part most often\r\naffected.\r\n\r\nIn many instances there is no destruction of the skin, but simply a\r\ntemporary suspension of the horn-producing function of the coronary\r\nband. The fore feet are more often affected than the hind ones, and the\r\nheels and quarters are less often involved than the front part of the\r\nfoot. The coronary band becomes hot, swollen, and painful, and after two\r\nor three days the horn separates from the band and slight suppuration\r\nfollows. For a few days the animal is lame, but as the suppuration\r\ndisappears the lameness subsides. New horn, often of an inferior\r\nquality, is produced by the coronary band, and in time the cleft is\r\ngrown off and complete recovery is effected. The frog is occasionally\r\nfrostbitten and may slough off, exposing the soft tissues beneath and\r\ncausing severe lameness for a time.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Simple frostbites are best treated by cold fomentations\r\nfollowed by applications of a 5 per cent solution of carbolized oil.\r\nWhen portions of the skin are destroyed, their early separation should\r\nbe hastened by warm fomentations and poultices. Ulcers are to be treated\r\nby the application of stimulating dressings, such as carbolized oil, a 1\r\nper cent solution of nitrate of silver or of chlorid of zinc, with pads\r\nof oakum and flannel bandages. In many of these cases recovery is\r\nexceedingly slow. The new tissue by which the destroyed skin is replaced\r\nalways shrinks in healing, and, as a consequence, unsightly scars are\r\nunavoidable. When the coronary band is involved it is generally\r\nadvisable to blister the coronet over the seat of injury as soon as the\r\nsuppuration ceases, for the purpose of stimulating the growth of new\r\nhorn. Where a crevasse is formed between the old and the new horn no\r\nserious trouble is liable to be met with until the cleft is nearly grown\r\nout, when the soft tissues may be exposed by a breaking off of the\r\npartly detached horn. But even if this accident happens final recovery\r\nis effected by poulticing the foot until a sufficient growth of horn\r\nprotects the parts from injury.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUITTOR.\r\n\r\nQuittor is a term applied to various affections of the foot wherein the\r\ntissues which are involved undergo a process of degeneration that\r\nresults in the formation of a slough followed by the elimination of the\r\ndiseased structures by means of a more or less extensive suppuration.\r\n\r\nFor convenience of consideration quittors may be divided into four\r\nclasses, as suggested by Girard: (1) Cutaneous quittor, which is known\r\nalso as simple quittor, skin quittor, and carbuncle of the coronet; (2)\r\ntendinous quittor; (3) subhorny quittor; and (4) cartilaginous quittor.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUTANEOUS QUITTOR.\r\n\r\nSimple quittor consists in a local inflammation of the skin and\r\nsubcutaneous connective tissue on some part of the coronet, followed by\r\na slough and the formation of an ulcer which heals by suppuration.\r\n\r\nIt is an extremely painful disease, owing to the dense character of the\r\ntissues involved; for in all dense structures the swelling which\r\naccompanies inflammation always produces intense pressure. This pressure\r\nnot only adds to the patient's suffering but may at the same time\r\nendanger the life of the affected parts by strangulating the blood\r\nvessels. It is held by some writers that simple quittor is most often\r\nmet with in the hind feet, but in my experience more than two-thirds of\r\nthe cases have developed in the fore feet. While any part of the coronet\r\nmay become the seat of attack, the heels and quarters are undoubtedly\r\nmost liable.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Bruises and other wounds of the coronet are often the cause\r\nof cutaneous quittor, yet there can be no question that in the great\r\nmajority of cases the disease develops without any known cause. For some\r\nreason not yet satisfactorily explained most cases happen in the fall of\r\nthe year. One explanation of this fact has been attempted in the\r\nstatement that the disease is due to the injurious action of cold and\r\nmud. This claim, however, seems to lose force when it is remembered that\r\nin many parts of this country the most mud, accompanied with freezing\r\nand thawing weather, is seen in the early springtime without a\r\ncorresponding increase of quittor. Furthermore, the serious outbreaks of\r\nthis disease in the mountainous regions of Colorado, Wyoming, and\r\nMontana are seen in the fall and winter seasons, when the weather is the\r\ndriest. It may be claimed, and perhaps with justice, that during these\r\nseasons, when the water is low, animals are compelled to wade through\r\nmore mud to drink from lakes and pools than is necessary at other\r\nseasons of the year, when these lakes and pools are full. Add to these\r\nconditions the further fact that much of this mud is impregnated with\r\nalkaline salts which, like the mineral substances always found in the\r\nmud of cities, are more or less irritating, and it seems fair to\r\nconclude that under certain circumstances mud may become an important\r\nfactor in the production of quittor.[3]\r\n\r\nWhile this disease attacks any and all classes of horses, it is the\r\nlarge, common breeds, with thick skins, heavy coats, and coarse legs\r\nthat are most often affected. Horses well groomed and cared for in\r\nstables seem to be less liable to the disease than those running at\r\nlarge or than those which are kept and worked under adverse\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Lameness, lasting from one to three or four days, nearly\r\nalways precedes the development of the strictly local evidences of\r\nquittor. The next sign is the appearance of a small, tense, hot, and\r\npainful tumor in the skin of the coronary region. If the skin of the\r\naffected foot is white, the inflamed portion will present a dark-red or\r\neven a purplish appearance near the center. Within a few hours the\r\nankle, or even the whole leg as high as the knee or hock, becomes much\r\nswollen. The lameness is now so great that the patient refuses to use\r\nthe foot at all, but carries it if compelled to move. As a consequence,\r\nthe opposite leg is required to do the work of both, and if the animal\r\npersists in standing a greater part of the time it, too, becomes\r\nswollen. In many of these cases the suffering is so intense during the\r\nfirst few days as to cause general fever, dullness, loss of appetite,\r\nand increased thirst. Generally the tumor shows signs of suppuration\r\nwithin 48 to 72 hours after its first appearance; the summit softens, a\r\nfluctuating fluid is felt beneath the skin, which soon ulcerates\r\ncompletely through, causing the discharge of a thick, yellow, bloody\r\npus, containing shreds of dead tissue which have sloughed away. The sore\r\nis now converted into an open ulcer, generally deep, nearly or quite\r\ncircular in outline, and with hardened base and edges. In exceptional\r\ncases large patches of skin, varying from 1 to 2-1/2 inches in diameter,\r\nslough away at once, leaving an ugly superficial ulcer. These sores,\r\nespecially when deep, suppurate freely, and if there are no\r\ncomplications they tend to heal rapidly as soon as the degenerated\r\ntissue has softened and is entirely removed. When suppuration is fully\r\nestablished, the lameness and general symptoms subside. When but a\r\nsingle tumor and abscess form, the disease progresses rapidly, and\r\nrecovery, under proper treatment, may be effected in from two to three\r\nweeks; but when two or more tumors are developed at once, or if the\r\nformation of one tumor is rapidly succeeded by another for an indefinite\r\ntime, the sufferings of the patient are greatly increased, the case is\r\nmore difficult to treat, and recovery is more slow and less certain.\r\n\r\nThis form of quittor is often complicated with the tendinous and\r\nsubhorny quittors by an extension of the sloughing process.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The first step in the treatment of an outbreak of quittor\r\nshould be the removal of all exciting causes. Crowding animals into\r\nsmall corrals and stables, where injuries to the coronet are likely to\r\nhappen from trampling, especially among unbroken range horses, must be\r\navoided as much as possible.\r\n\r\nWatering places accessible without having to wade through mud should be\r\nprovided. In towns, where the mud or dust is largely impregnated with\r\nmineral products, it is not possible to adopt complete preventive\r\nmeasures. Much can be done, however, by careful cleansing of the feet\r\nand legs as soon as the animal returns from work. Warm water should be\r\nused to remove the mud and dirt, after which the parts are to be\r\nthoroughly dried with soft cloths.\r\n\r\nThe means which are to be adopted for the cure of cutaneous quittor vary\r\nwith the stage of the disease at the time the case is presented for\r\ntreatment. If the case is seen early--that is, before any of the signs\r\nof suppuration have developed--the affected foot is to be placed under a\r\nconstant stream of cold water, with the object of arresting a further\r\nextension of the inflammatory process. To accomplish this, put the\r\npatient in slings in a narrow stall having a slat or open floor. Bandage\r\nthe foot and leg to the knee or hock, as the case may be, with flannel\r\nbandages loosely applied. Set a tub or barrel filled with cold water\r\nabove the patient, and by the use of a small rubber hose of sufficient\r\nlength make a siphon which will carry the water from the bottom of the\r\ntub to the leg at the top of the bandage. The stream of water should be\r\nquite small, and is to be continued until the inflammation has entirety\r\nsubsided or until the presence of pus can be detected in the tumor. When\r\nsuppuration has commenced, the process should be aided by the use of\r\nwarm baths and poultices of lineseed meal or boiled turnips. If the\r\ntumor is of rapid growth, accompanied with intense pain, relief is\r\nobtained and sloughing largely limited by a free incision of the parts.\r\nThe incision should be vertical and deep into the tumor, care being\r\ntaken not to divide the coronary band entirely. If the tumor is large,\r\nmore than one incision may be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe foot should now be placed in a warm bath for half an hour or longer\r\nand then poulticed. The hemorrhage produced by the cutting and\r\nencouraged by the warm bath is generally very copious and soon gives\r\nrelief to the overtension of the parts.\r\n\r\nIn other cases it will be found that suppuration is well under way, so\r\nthat the center of the tumor is soft when the patient is first presented\r\nfor treatment. It is always good surgery to relieve the tumor of pus\r\nwhenever its presence can be detected; hence, in these cases a free\r\nincision must be made into the softened parts, the pus evacuated, and\r\nthe foot poulticed.\r\n\r\nBy surgical interference the tumor is now converted into an open sore or\r\nulcer, which, after it has been well cleaned by warm baths and poultices\r\napplied for two or three days, needs to be protected by proper\r\ndressings. The best of all protective dressings is made of small balls,\r\nor pledgets, of oakum, carefully packed into the wound and held in place\r\nby a roller bandage 4 yards long, from 3 to 4 inches wide, made of\r\ncommon bedticking and skillfully applied.\r\n\r\nThe remedies which may be used to stimulate the healing process are\r\nmany, and, as a rule, they are applied in the form of solutions or\r\ntinctures.\r\n\r\nIn my own practice I prefer a solution of bichlorid of mercury 1 part,\r\nwater 500 parts, with a few drops of muriatic acid or a few grains of\r\nmuriate of ammonia added to dissolve the mercury. The balls of oakum are\r\nwet with this solution before they are applied to the wound.\r\n\r\nAmong the other remedies which may be used, and perhaps with equally as\r\ngood results, will be noted the sulphate of copper, iron, and zinc, 5\r\ngrains of either to the ounce of water; chlorid of zinc, 5 grains to the\r\nounce; carbolic acid, 20 drops dissolved in an equal quantity of\r\nglycerin and added to 1 ounce of water; and nitrate of silver, 10 grains\r\nto the ounce of water.\r\n\r\nIf the wound is slow to heal, it will be found of advantage to change\r\nthe remedies every few days.\r\n\r\nIf the wound is pale in color, the granulations transparent and\r\nglistening, the tincture of aloes, tincture of gentian, or the spirits\r\nof camphor may do best.\r\n\r\nWhen the sore is red in color and healing rapidly, an ointment made of 1\r\npart of carbolic acid to 40 parts of cosmoline or vaseline is all that\r\nis needed.\r\n\r\nIf the granulations continue to grow until a tumor is formed which\r\nprojects beyond the surrounding skin, it should be cut off with a sharp,\r\nclean knife, and the foot poulticed for twenty-four hours, after which\r\nthe wound is to be well cauterized daily with lunar caustic and the\r\nbandages applied with great firmness.\r\n\r\nThe question as to how often the dressings should be renewed must be\r\ndetermined by the condition of the wound, etc. If the sore is\r\nsuppurating freely, it will be necessary to renew the dressing every 24\r\nor 48 hours; if the discharge is small in quantity and the patient\r\ncomfortable, the dressing may be left on for several days; in fact, the\r\nless often the wound is disturbed, the better, so long as the healing\r\nprocess is healthy. When the sore commences to \"skin over,\" the edges\r\nshould be lightly touched with lunar caustic at each dressing. The\r\npatient may now be given a little exercise daily, but the bandages must\r\nbe kept on until the wound is entirely healed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTENDINOUS QUITTOR.\r\n\r\nThis form of quittor differs from the cutaneous in that it not only\r\naffects the skin and subcutaneous tissues, but involves also the tendons\r\nof the leg, the ligaments of the joints, and, in many cases, the bones\r\nof the foot as well.\r\n\r\nFortunately, this form of quittor is less common than the preceding, yet\r\nany case beginning as simple cutaneous quittor may at any time during\r\nits course become complicated by the death of some part of the tendons,\r\nby gangrene of the ligaments, sloughing of the coronary band, caries of\r\nthe bones, or inflammation and suppuration of the synovial sacs and\r\njoints, thereby converting a simple quittor into one which will, in all\r\nprobability, either destroy the patient's life or maim him for all time.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Tendinous quittor is caused by the same injuries and\r\ninfluences that produce the simple form. Zundel believes it to be a not\r\ninfrequent accompaniment of distemper. In my own experience I have seen\r\nnothing to verify this belief, but I am convinced that young animals are\r\nmore liable to have tendinous quittor than older ones, and that they are\r\nmuch more likely to make a good recovery.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--When a case of simple quittor is transformed into the\r\ntendinous variety the change is announced by a sudden increase in the\r\nseverity of all the symptoms. On the other hand, if the attack primarily\r\nis one of tendinous quittor, the earliest symptom seen is a well-marked\r\nlameness. In those cases due to causes other than injuries this lameness\r\nis at first very slight, and the animal limps no more in trotting than\r\nin walking; later on, generally during the next 48 hours, the lameness\r\nincreases to such extent that the patient often refuses to use the leg\r\nat all. An examination made during the first two days rarely discloses\r\nany cause for this lameness; it may not be possible even to say with\r\ncertainty that the foot is the seat of the trouble. On the third or\r\nfourth day, sometimes as late as the fifth, a doughy-feeling tumor will\r\nbe found forming on the heel or quarter. This tumor grows rapidly, feels\r\nhot to the touch, and is extremely painful. As the tumor develops, all\r\nthe other symptoms increase in intensity; the pulse is rapid and hard;\r\nthe breathing quick; the temperature elevated 3 deg. or 4 deg.; the appetite is\r\ngone; thirst increased; and the lameness so great that the foot is\r\ncarried if locomotion is attempted. At this stage of the disease the\r\npatient generally seeks relief by lying upon the broad side, with\r\noutstretched legs; the coat is bedewed with a clammy sweat, and every\r\nrespiration is accompanied with a moan. The leg soon swells to the\r\nfetlock; later this swelling gradually extends to the knee or hock, and\r\nin some cases reaches the body. As a rule, several days elapse before\r\nthe disease develops a well-defined abscess, for, owing to the dense\r\nstructure of the bones, ligaments, and tendons, the suppurative process\r\nis a slow one, and the pus is prevented from readily collecting in a\r\nmass.\r\n\r\nI made a post-mortem examination on a typical case of this disease, in\r\nwhich the animal had died on the fourth day after being found on the\r\nrange slightly lame. The suffering had been intense, yet the only\r\nexternal evidences of the disease consisted in the shedding of the hoof\r\nfrom the right fore foot and a limited swelling of the leg to the knee.\r\nThe sloughing of the hoof took place two or three hours before death,\r\nand was accompanied with but little suppuration and no hemorrhage. The\r\nskin from the knee to the foot was thickened from watery infiltration\r\n(edema), and on the inside quarter three holes, each about one-half inch\r\nin diameter, were found. All had ragged edges, while but one had gone\r\ndeep enough to perforate the coronary band. The loose connective tissue\r\nbeneath the skin was distended, with a gelatinous infiltration over the\r\nwhole course of the flexor tendons and to the fetlock joint over the\r\ntendon in front. The soft tissues covering the coffin bone were loosened\r\nin patches by collections of pus which had formed beneath the sensitive\r\nlaminae. The coffin and pastern joints were inflamed, as were also the\r\ncoffin, navicular, and coronet bones, while the outside toe of the\r\ncoffin bone had become softened from suppuration until it readily\r\ncrumbled between the fingers. The coronary band was largely destroyed\r\nand completely separated from the other tissues of the foot. The inner\r\nlateral cartilage was gangrenous, as was also a small spot on the\r\nextensor tendon near its point of attachment on the coffin bone. Several\r\nsmall collections of pus were found deep in the connective tissue of the\r\ncoronary region; along the course of the sesamoid ligaments; in the\r\nsheath of the flexor tendons; under the tendon just below the fetlock\r\njoint in front; and in the coffin joint.\r\n\r\nBut all cases of tendinous quittor are by no means so complicated as\r\nthis one was. In rare instances the swelling is slight, and after a few\r\ndays the lameness and other symptoms subside, without any discharge of\r\npus from an external opening. In most cases, however, from one to half a\r\ndozen or more soft points arise on the skin of the coronet, open, and\r\ndischarge slowly a thick, yellow, fetid, and bloody matter. In other\r\ncases the suppurative process is largely confined to the sensitive\r\nlaminae and plantar cushion, when the suffering is intense until the pus\r\nfinds an avenue of escape by separating the hoof from the coronary\r\nband, at or near the heels, without causing a loss of the whole horny\r\nbox. When the flexor tendon is involved deep in the foot, the discharge\r\nof pus usually takes place from an opening in the follow of the heel; if\r\nthe sesamoid ligament or the sheath of the flexors are affected, the\r\nopening is nearer the fetlock joint, although in most of these cases the\r\nsuppuration spreads along the course of the tendons until the navicular\r\njoint is involved, and extensive sloughing of the deeper parts follows.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment of tendinous quittor is to be directed\r\ntoward the saving of the foot. First of all an effort must be made to\r\nprevent suppuration; if the patient is seen at the beginning, cold\r\nirrigation, recommended in the treatment for cutaneous quittor, is to be\r\nresorted to. Later, when the tumor is forming on the coronet, the knife\r\nmust be used, and a free and deep incision made into the swelling.\r\nWhenever openings appear, from which pus escapes, they should be\r\ncarefully probed; in all instances these fistulous tracts lead down to\r\ndead tissue which nature is trying to remove by the process of\r\nsloughing. If a counter opening can be made, which will enable a more\r\nready escape of the pus, it should be done at once; for instance, if the\r\nprobe shows that the discharge originates from the bottom of the foot,\r\nthe sole must be pared through over the seat of trouble. Whenever\r\nsuppuration has commenced the process is to be stimulated by the use of\r\nwarm baths and poultices. The pus which accumulates in the deeper parts,\r\nespecially along the tendons, around the joints, and in the hoof, is to\r\nbe removed by pressure and injections made with a small syringe,\r\nrepeated two or three times a day. As soon as the discharge assumes a\r\nhealthy character and diminishes in quantity, stimulating solutions are\r\nto be injected into the open wounds. When the tendons, ligaments, and\r\nother deeper parts are affected, a strong solution of carbolic acid--1\r\nto 4--should be used at first; or strong solutions of tincture of iodin,\r\nsulphate of iron, sulphate of copper, bichlorid of mercury, etc., may be\r\nused in place of the carbolic; after this the remedies and dressings\r\ndirected for use in simple quittor are to be used. In those cases in\r\nwhich the fistulous tracts refuse to heal it is often necessary to burn\r\nthem out with a saturated solution of caustic soda, equal parts of\r\nmuriatic acid and water, or, better still, with a long, thin iron,\r\nheated white hot.\r\n\r\nBut no matter what treatment is adopted, a large percentage of the cases\r\nof tendinous quittor fail to make good recoveries. If the entire hoof\r\nsloughs away, the growth of a new, but soft and imperfect hoof may be\r\nobtained by carefully protecting the exposed tissues with proper\r\nbandages. When the joints are opened by deep sloughing, recovery may\r\neventually take place, but the joint remains immovable ever after. If\r\ncaries of a small part of the coffin bone takes place, it may be\r\nremoved by an operation; but if much of the bone is affected, or if the\r\nnavicular and coronet bones are involved in the carious process, the\r\nonly hope for a cure is in the amputation of the foot. This operation is\r\nadvisable only when the animal is valuable for breeding purposes. In all\r\nother cases in which there is no hope for recovery the patient's\r\nsuffering should be relieved by death. In tendinous quittor much\r\nthickening of the coronary region, and sometimes of the ankle and\r\nfetlock, remains after suppuration has ceased and the fistulous tracts\r\nhave healed. To stimulate the reabsorption of this new and unnecessary\r\ntissue, the parts should be fired with the hot iron, or, in its absence,\r\nrepeated blistering with the biniodid of mercury ointment may largely\r\naccomplish the same results.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBHORNY QUITTOR.\r\n\r\nThis is the most common form of the disease. It is generally seen in but\r\none foot at a time, and more often in the fore than in the hind feet. It\r\nnearly always attacks the inside quarter, but may affect the outside,\r\nthe band in front, or the heel, where it is of but little consequence.\r\nIt consists in the inflammation of a small part of the coronary band and\r\nadjacent skin, followed by sloughing and suppuration, which in most\r\ncases extends to the neighboring sensitive laminae.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Injuries to the coronet, such as bruises, overreaching, and\r\ncalk wounds, are considered as the common causes of this disease. Still,\r\ncases occur in which there appears to be no existing cause, just as in\r\nthe other forms of quittor, and it seems fair to conclude that subhorny\r\nquittor may also be produced by internal causes.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--At the outset the lameness is always severe, and the\r\npatient often refuses to use the affected foot. Swelling of the coronet\r\nclose to the top of the hoof causes the quarter to protrude beyond the\r\nwall. This tumor is extremely sensitive, and the whole foot is hot and\r\npainful. After a few days a small spot in the skin, over the most\r\nelevated part of the tumor, softens and opens or the hoof separates from\r\nthe coronary band at the quarter or well back toward the heel. From this\r\nopening, wherever it may be, a thin, watery, often dark, offensive\r\ndischarge escapes, at times mixed with blood and always containing a\r\nconsiderable percentage of pus.\r\n\r\nProbing will now disclose a fistulous tract leading to the bottom of the\r\ndiseased tissues. If the opening is small, there is a tendency upon the\r\npart of the suppurative process to spread downward; the pus gradually\r\nseparates the hoof from the sensitive laminae until the sole is reached,\r\nand even a portion of this may be undermined.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the slough in this form of quittor is not deep, and if the\r\ncase receives early and proper treatment complications are generally\r\navoided; but if the case is neglected, and, occasionally, even in spite\r\nof the best treatment, the disease spreads until the tendon in front,\r\nthe lateral cartilage, or the coffin bone and joint as well are\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nIn all cases of subhorny quittor much relief is experienced when the\r\nslough comes away, and rapid recovery is made. If, however, after the\r\nlapse of a few days, the lameness remains and the wound continues to\r\ndischarge a thin, unhealthy matter, the probabilities are that the\r\ndisease is spreading, and pus collecting in the deeper parts of the\r\nfoot. In Zundel's opinion, if the use of the probe now detects a pus\r\ncavity below the opening, a cartilaginous quittor is in the course of\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Hot baths and poultices are to be used until the presence\r\nof pus can be determined, when the tumor is to be opened with a knife or\r\nsharp-pointed iron heated white hot. The hot baths and poultices are now\r\ncontinued for a few days or until the entire slough has come away and\r\nthe discharge is diminished, when dressings recommended in the treatment\r\nfor cutaneous quittor are to be used until recovery is completed. In\r\ncases in which the discharge comes from a cleft between the upper border\r\nof the hoof and the coronary band, always pare away the loosened horn,\r\nso that the soft tissues beneath are fully exposed, care being taken not\r\nto injure the healthy parts. This operation permits of a thorough\r\ninspection of the diseased parts, the easy removal of all gangrenous\r\ntissue, and a better application of the necessary remedies and\r\ndressings. The only objection to the operation is that the patient is\r\nprevented from being early returned to work.\r\n\r\nWhen the probe shows that pus has collected under the coffin bone the\r\nsole must be pared through, and, if caries of the bone is present, the\r\ndead parts cut away. After either of these operations the wound is to be\r\ndressed with the oakum balls, saturated in the bichlorid of mercury\r\nsolution, as previously directed, and the bandages tightly applied.\r\nGenerally the discharge for the first two or three days is so great that\r\nthe dressings need to be changed every 24 hours; but when the discharge\r\ndiminishes, the dressing may be left on from one to two weeks. Before\r\nthe patient is returned to work, a bar shoe should be applied, since the\r\nremoved quarter or heel can only be made perfect again by a new growth\r\nfrom the coronary band.\r\n\r\nTendinous or cartilaginous complications are to be treated as directed\r\nunder those headings.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARTILAGINOUS QUITTOR.\r\n\r\nThis form of quittor may commence as a primary inflammation of the\r\nlateral cartilage, but in the great majority of cases it appears as a\r\nsequel to cutaneous or subhorny quittor. It may affect either the fore\r\nor hind feet, but is most commonly seen in the former. As a rule, it\r\nattacks but one foot at a time, and but one of the cartilages, generally\r\nthe inner one. It is always a serious affection for the reason that, in\r\nmany cases, it can only be cured by a surgical operation, requiring a\r\nthorough knowledge of the anatomy of the parts involved, and much\r\nsurgical skill.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Direct injuries to the coronet, such as trampling, pricks,\r\nburns, and the blow of some heavy falling object which may puncture,\r\nbruise, or crush the cartilage, are the common direct causes of\r\ncartilaginous quittor. Besides being a sequel to the other forms of\r\nquittor, it sometimes develops as a complication in suppurative corn,\r\ncanker, grease, laminitis, and punctured wounds of the foot. Animals\r\nused for heavy draft, and those with flat feet and low heels, are more\r\nliable to the disease than others, for the reason that they are more\r\nexposed to injury. Rough roads also predispose to the disease by\r\nincreasing liability to injury.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--When the disease commences as a primary inflammation of the\r\ncartilage, lameness develops with the formation of a swelling on the\r\nside of the coronet over the quarter. The severity of this lameness\r\ndepends largely upon the part of the cartilage which is diseased, for if\r\nthe disease is situated in that part of the cartilage nearest the heel,\r\nwhere the surrounding tissues are soft and spongy, the lameness may be\r\nvery slight, especially if the patient is required to go no faster than\r\na walk; but when the middle and anterior parts of the cartilage are\r\ndiseased, the pain and consequent lameness are much greater, for the\r\ntissues are less elastic and the coffin joint is more liable to become\r\naffected.\r\n\r\nExcept in the cases to be noted hereafter, one or more fistulous\r\nopenings finally appear in the tumor on the coronet. These openings are\r\nsurrounded by a small mass of granulations which are elevated above the\r\nadjacent skin and bleed readily if handled. A probe shows these\r\nfistulous tracts to be more or less sinuous, but always leading to one\r\npoint--the gangrenous cartilage. When cartilaginous quittor happens as a\r\ncomplication of suppurative corn, or from punctured wounds of the foot,\r\nthe fistulous tract may open alone at the point of injury on the sole.\r\n\r\nThe discharge in this form of quittor is generally thin, watery, and\r\ncontains pus enough to give it a pale-yellow color; it is offensive to\r\nthe sense of smell, due to the detachment of small flakes of cartilage\r\nwhich have become gangrenous and are seen in the discharge as small,\r\ngreenish-colored particles. In old cases it is not unusual to find some\r\nof the fistulous openings heal at the surface; this is followed by the\r\ngradual collection of pus in the deeper parts, forming an abscess, which\r\nin a short time opens at a new point. The wall of the hoof, over the\r\naffected quarter and heel, in very old cases becomes rough and wrinkled\r\nlike the horn of a ram, and generally it is thicker than the\r\ncorresponding quarter, owing to the stimulating effect which the disease\r\nhas upon the coronary band.\r\n\r\nComplications may arise by an extension of the disease to the lateral\r\nligament of the coffin joint, to the joint itself, to the plantar\r\ncushion, and by caries of the coffin bone.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Before recovery can take place all the dead cartilage must\r\nbe removed. In rare instances this is effected by nature without\r\nassistance. Usually, however, the disease does not tend to recovery, and\r\nactive curative measures must be adopted. The best and simplest\r\ntreatment, in a majority of cases, is the injection of strong caustic\r\nsolutions, which destroy the diseased cartilage and cause its discharge,\r\nalong with the other products of suppuration. In favorable cases these\r\ninjections will secure a healing of the wound in from two to three\r\nweeks. While the saturated solution of sulphate of copper, or a solution\r\nof 10 parts of bichlorid of mercury to 100 parts of water, has given the\r\nbest results in my hands, equally as favorable success has been secured\r\nby others from the use of caustic soda, nitrate of silver, sulphate of\r\nzinc, tincture of iodin, etc. No matter which one of these remedies may\r\nbe selected, however, it must be used at least twice a day for a time.\r\nThe solution is injected into the various openings with force enough to\r\ndrive it to the bottom of the wound, after which the foot is to be\r\ndressed with a pad of oakum, held in place by a roller bandage tightly\r\napplied. While it is not always necessary, it is often of advantage to\r\nrelieve the pressure on the parts by rasping away the hoof over the seat\r\nof the cartilage; the coronary band and laminae should not be injured in\r\nthe operation.\r\n\r\nIf the caustic injections prove successful, the discharge will become\r\nhealthy and gradually diminish, so that by the end of the second week\r\nthe fistulous tracts are closing up and the injections are made with\r\nmuch difficulty.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, there is but little or no improvement after this\r\ntreatment has been used for three weeks, it may reasonably be concluded\r\nthat the operation for the removal of the lateral cartilage must be\r\nresorted to for the cure of the trouble. As this operation can be safely\r\nundertaken only by an expert surgeon, it will not be described in this\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHRUSH.\r\n\r\nThrush is characterized by an excessive secretion of unhealthy matter\r\nfrom the cleft of the frog. While all classes of horses are liable to\r\nthis affection, it is more often seen in the common draft horse than in\r\nany other breed, owing to the conditions of servitude and not to the\r\nfault of the breed. Country horses are much less subject to the\r\ndisease, except in wet, marshy districts, than are the horses used in\r\ncities and towns.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--The most common cause of thrush is the filthy condition of\r\nthe stable in which the animal is kept. Mares are more liable to\r\ncontract the disease in the hind feet when filth is the cause, while the\r\ngelding and stallion are more liable to develop it in the fore feet.\r\nHard work on rough and stony roads may also induce the disease, as may a\r\nchange from dryness to excessive moisture. The latter cause is often\r\nseen to operate in old track horses, whose feet are constantly soaked in\r\nthe bathtub for the purpose of relieving soreness. Muddy streets and\r\nroads, especially where mineral substances are plentiful, excite this\r\nabnormal condition of the frog. Contracted heels, scratches, and\r\nnavicular disease predispose to thrush, while by some a constitutional\r\ntendency is believed to exist among certain animals which otherwise\r\npresent a perfect frog.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--At first there is simply an increased moisture in the cleft\r\nof the frog, accompanied with an offensive smell. After a time a\r\nconsiderable discharge takes place--thin, watery, and highly offensive,\r\nchanging gradually to a thicker puriform matter, which rapidly destroys\r\nthe horn of the frog. Only in old and severe cases is the patient lame\r\nand the foot feverish--cases in which the whole frog is involved in the\r\ndiseased process.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Thrushes are to be treated by cleanliness, the removal of\r\nall exciting causes, and a return of the frog to its normal condition.\r\nAs a rule, the diseased and ragged portions of horn are to be pared away\r\nand the foot poulticed for a day or two with boiled turnips, to which\r\nmay be added a few drops of carbolic acid or a handful of powdered\r\ncharcoal to destroy the offensive smell. The cleft of the frog and the\r\ngrooves on its edges are then to be cleaned and well filled with dry\r\ncalomel and the foot dressed with oakum and a roller bandage. If the\r\ndischarge is profuse, the dressing should be changed daily; otherwise it\r\nmay be left on two or three days. Where a constitutional taint is\r\nsupposed to exist, with swelling of the legs, grease, etc., a purgative,\r\nfollowed by dram doses of sulphate of iron, repeated daily, may be\r\nprescribed. In cases where the growth of horn seems too slow a\r\nSpanish-fly blister applied to the heels is often followed by good\r\nresults. Feet in which the disease is readily induced may be protected\r\nin the stable with a leather boot. If the thrush is but a sequel to\r\nother disease, a permanent cure may not be possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANKER.\r\n\r\nCanker of the foot is due to the rapid reproduction of a vegetable\r\nparasite. It not only destroys the sole and frog, but, by setting up a\r\nchronic inflammation in the deeper tissues, prevents the growth of a\r\nhealthy horn by which the injury may be repaired. Heavy cart horses are\r\nmore often affected than those of any other class.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--The essential element in the production of canker is the\r\nparasite; consequently the disease may be called contagious. As in all\r\nother diseases due to specific causes, however, the seeds of the\r\ndisorder must find a suitable soil in which to grow before they are\r\nreproduced. It may be said, then, that the conditions which favor the\r\npreparation of the tissues for a reception of the seeds of this disease\r\nare simply predisposing causes.\r\n\r\nThe condition most favorable to the development of canker is\r\ndampness--in fact, dampness seems indispensable to the existence and\r\ngrowth of the parasite; the disease is rarely, if ever, seen in high,\r\ndry districts, and is much more common in rainy than in dry seasons.\r\nFilthy stables and muddy roads have been classed among the causes of\r\ncanker; but it is very doubtful whether these conditions can do more\r\nthan favor a preparation of the foot for the reception of the disease\r\ngerm.\r\n\r\nAll injuries to the feet, by exposing the soft tissues, may render the\r\nanimal susceptible to infection; but neither the injury nor the\r\nirritation and inflammation of the tissues which follow are sufficient\r\nto induce the disease.\r\n\r\nFor some unknown reason horses with lymphatic temperaments--thick skins,\r\nflat feet, fleshy frogs, heavy hair, and particularly with white feet\r\nand legs--are especially liable to canker.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Usually, canker is confined to one foot; but it may attack\r\ntwo, three, or all of the feet at once; or, as is more commonly seen,\r\nthe disease attacks first one then another, until all may have been\r\nsuccessively affected. When the disease follows an injury which has\r\nexposed the soft tissues of the foot, the wound shows no tendency to\r\nheal, but instead there is secreted from the inflamed parts a profuse,\r\nthin, fetid, watery discharge, which gradually undermines and destroys\r\nthe surrounding horn, until a large part of the sole and frog is\r\ndiseased. The living tissues are swollen, dark colored, and covered at\r\ncertain points with particles of new, soft, yellowish, thready horn,\r\nwhich are constantly undergoing maceration in the abundant liquid\r\nsecretion by which they are immersed. As this secretion escapes to the\r\nsurrounding parts, it dries and forms small, cheesy masses composed of\r\npartly dried horny matter, exceedingly offensive to the sense of smell.\r\nWhen the disease originates independently of an injury, the first\r\nevidences of the trouble are the offensive odor of the foot, the liquid\r\nsecretion from the cleft and sides of the frog, and the rotting away of\r\nthe horn of the frog and sole.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier stages there is no interference with locomotion, but\r\nlater the foot becomes sensitive, particularly if the animal is used on\r\nrough roads, and, finally, when the sole and frog are largely destroyed\r\nthe lameness is severe.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Since canker does not destroy the power of the tissues to\r\nproduce horn, but rather excites them to an excessive production of an\r\nimperfect horn, the indications for treatment are to restore the parts\r\nto a normal condition, when healthy horn may again be secreted. In my\r\nexperience, limited though it has been, the old practice of stripping\r\noff the entire sole and deep cauterization, with either the hot iron or\r\nstrong acids, is not attended with uniformly good results.\r\n\r\nI am of the opinion that recovery can generally be effected as surely\r\nand as speedily with measures which are less heroic and much less\r\npainful. True, the treatment of canker is likely to exhaust the\r\npatience, and sometimes the resources, of the attendant; but after all\r\nsuccess depends more on the persistent application of simple remedies\r\nand great cleanliness than on the special virtues of any particular\r\ndrug.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, clean the foot with warm baths and apply a poultice\r\ncontaining powdered charcoal or carbolic acid. A handful of the charcoal\r\nor a tablespoonful of the acid mixed with the poultice serves to destroy\r\nmuch of the offensive odor. The diseased portions of horn are to be\r\ncarefully removed with sharp instruments, until only healthy horn\r\nborders the affected parts. The edges of the sound horn are to be pared\r\nthin, so that the swollen soft tissues may not overlap their borders.\r\nWith sharp scissors cut off all the prominent points on the soft\r\ntissues, shorten the walls of the foot, and nail on a broad, plain shoe.\r\nThe foot is now ready for the dressings, and any of the many stimulating\r\nand drying remedies may be used; but it will be necessary to change\r\nfrequently from one to another, until finally all may be tried.\r\n\r\nThe list from which a selection may be made comprises wood tar, gas tar,\r\npetroleum, creosote, phenic acid; sulphates of iron, copper, and zinc;\r\nchlorid of zinc, bichlorid of mercury, calomel, caustic soda, nitrate of\r\nsilver, chlorid of lime; carbolic, nitric, and sulphuric acids.\r\n\r\nIn practice I prefer to give the newly shod foot a bath for an hour or\r\ntwo in a solution of the sulphate of iron made by adding 2 ounces of the\r\npowdered sulphate to a gallon of cold water. When the foot is removed\r\nfrom the bath it is dressed with oakum balls dipped in a mixture made of\r\nBarbados tar 1 part, oil of turpentine 8 parts, to which is slowly added\r\n2 parts of sulphuric acid, and the mixture well stirred and cooled. The\r\ndiseased parts being well covered with the balls, a pad of oakum\r\nsufficiently thick to cause considerable pressure is placed over them,\r\nand all are held in place by pieces of heavy tin fitted to slip under\r\nthe shoe. The whole foot is now incased in a boot or folded gunny sack\r\nand the patient turned into a loose, dry box. The dressings are to be\r\nchanged daily or even twice a day at first. When they are removed, all\r\npieces of new horny matter which are now firmly adherent must be rubbed\r\noff with the finger or a tent of oakum. As the secretion diminishes, dry\r\npowders, such as calomel, sulphates of iron, copper, etc., may prove of\r\nmost advantage. The sulphates should not be used pure, but are to be\r\nmixed with powdered animal charcoal in the proportion of one of the\r\nformer to eight or ten of the latter. When the soft tissues are all\r\nhorned over, the dressings should be continued for a time, weak\r\nsolutions being used to prevent a recurrence of the disease. If the\r\npatient is run down in condition, bitter tonics, such as gentian, may be\r\ngiven in 2-dram doses twice a day and a liberal diet of grain allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORNS.\r\n\r\nA corn is an injury to the living horn of the foot, involving the soft\r\ntissues beneath, whereby the capillary blood vessels are ruptured and a\r\nsmall quantity of blood escapes which, by permeating the horn in the\r\nimmediate neighborhood, stains it a dark color. If the injury is\r\ncontinuously repeated, the horn becomes altered in character and the\r\nsoft tissues may suppurate or a horny tumor develop. Corns always appear\r\nin the sole in the angle between the bar and the outside wall of the\r\nhoof. In many cases the laminae of the bar, of the wall, or of both, are\r\ninvolved at the same time.\r\n\r\nThree kinds of corns are commonly recognized--the dry, the moist, and\r\nthe suppurative--a division based solely on the character of the\r\nconditions which follow the primary injury.\r\n\r\nThe fore feet are almost exclusively the subjects of the disease, for\r\ntwo reasons: First, because they support a greater part of the body;\r\nsecondly, because the heel of the fore foot during progression is first\r\nplaced upon the ground, whereby it receives much more concussion than\r\nthe heel of the hind foot, in which the toe first strikes the ground.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--It may be said that all feet are exposed to corns, and that\r\neven the best feet may suffer from them when conditions necessary to the\r\nproduction of the peculiar injury are present. The heavier breeds of\r\nhorses generally used for heavy work on rough roads and streets seem to\r\nbe most liable to this trouble. Mules rarely have corns.\r\n\r\nAmong the causes and conditions which predispose to corns may be named\r\nhigh heels, which change the natural relative position of the bones of\r\nthe foot and thereby increase the concussion to which these parts are\r\nsubject; contracted heels, which in part destroy the elasticity of the\r\nfoot, increase the pressure upon the soft tissues of the heel, and\r\nrender lacerations more easy; long feet, which by removing the frog and\r\nheels too far from the ground deprive them of necessary moisture; this,\r\nin turn, reduces the elastic properties of the horn and diminishes the\r\ntransverse diameter of the heels; weak feet, or those in which the horn\r\nof the wall is too thin to resist the tendency to spread, whereby the\r\nsoft tissues are easily lacerated. Wide feet with low heels are always\r\naccompanied with a flat sole whose posterior wings either rest upon the\r\nground or the shoe, and as a consequence are easily bruised; at the same\r\ntime the arch of the sole is so broad and flat that it can not support\r\nthe weight of the body, and in the displacement which happens when the\r\nfoot is rested upon the ground the soft tissues are liable to become\r\nbruised or torn.\r\n\r\nIt is universally conceded that shoeing, either as a direct or\r\npredisposing cause, is most prolific in producing corns. One of the most\r\nserious as well as the most common of the errors in shoeing is to be\r\nfound in the preparation of the foot. Instead of seeking to maintain the\r\nintegrity of the arch, the first thing done is to weaken it by freely\r\nparing away the sole; nor does the mutilation end here, for the frog,\r\nwhich is nature's main support to the branches of the sole and the\r\nheels, is also largely cut away. This not only permits of an excessive\r\ndownward movement of the contents of the horny box, but it at the same\r\ntime removes the one great means by which concussion of the foot is\r\ndestroyed. As adjuncts to the foregoing errors must be added the faults\r\nof construction in the shoe and in the way it is adjusted to the foot.\r\nAn excess of concavity in the shoe, extending it too far back on the\r\nheels, high calks, thin heels which permit the shoe to spring, short\r\nheels with a calk set under the foot, and a shoe too light for the\r\nanimal wearing it or for the work required of him, are all to be avoided\r\nas causes of corns. A shoe so set so as to press upon the sole or one\r\nthat has been on so long that the hoof has overgrown it until the heels\r\nrest upon the sole and bars becomes a direct cause of corns. Indirectly\r\nthe shoe becomes the cause of corns when small stones, hard, dry earth,\r\nor other objects collect between the sole and shoe. Lastly, a rapid gait\r\nand excessive knee action, especially on hard roads, predispose to this\r\ndisease of the feet.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Ordinarily a corn induces sufficient pain to cause\r\nlameness. It may be intense, as seen in suppurative corn, or it may be\r\nbut a slight soreness, such as that which accompanies dry corn. It is by\r\nno means unusual in chronic corns to see old horses apparently so\r\naccustomed to the slight pain which they suffer as not to limp at all.\r\nBut they are generally very restless. They paw their bedding behind them\r\nat night and often refuse to lie down for a long rest. The lameness of\r\nthis disease, however, can hardly be said to be characteristic, for the\r\nreason that it varies so greatly in intensity; but the position of the\r\nleg while the patient is at rest is generally the same in all cases. The\r\nfoot is so advanced that it is relieved of all weight, and the fetlock\r\nis flexed until all pressure by the contents of the hoof is removed\r\nfrom the heels. In suppurative corn the lameness subsides or entirely\r\ndisappears as soon as the abscess opens. When the injured tissues are\r\nmuch inflamed, as may happen in severe and recent cases, the heel of the\r\naffected side, or even the whole foot, is hot and tender to pressure. In\r\ndry corn and in most chronic cases all evidences of local fever are\r\noften wanting. It is in these cases that the patient goes well when\r\nnewly shod, for the smith cuts away the sole over the seat of injury\r\nuntil all pressure by the shoe is removed and lowers the heels so that\r\nconcussion is reduced to a minimum.\r\n\r\nIf a corn is suspected, the foot should be examined for increased\r\nsensibility of the inside heel. Tapping the heel of the shoe with a\r\nhammer and grasping the wall and bar between the jaws of pincers with\r\nmoderate pressure will cause more or less flinching if the disease is\r\npresent. For further evidence the shoe is removed and the heel cut away\r\nwith the drawing knife. As the horn is pared out, not only the sole in\r\nthe angle is found discolored, but in many instances the insensible\r\nlaminae of the bar and wall adjacent are also stained with the escaped\r\nblood. In moist and suppurative corns this discoloration is less marked\r\nthan in dry corn and even may be entirely wanting. In these cases the\r\nhorn is soft, often white, and stringy or mealy, as seen in pumiced sole\r\nresulting from founder. When the whole thickness of the sole is\r\ndiscolored and the horn dry and brittle it is generally evidence that\r\nthe corn is an old one and that the exciting cause has existed\r\ncontinuously. A moist corn differs from the dry one in that the injury\r\nis more severe. The parts affected are more or less inflamed, and the\r\nhorn of the sole in the angle is undermined by a citron-colored fluid,\r\nwhich often permeates the injured sole and laminae, causing the horn to\r\nbecome somewhat spongy.\r\n\r\nA suppurative corn differs from others in that the inflammation ends in\r\nsuppuration. The pus collects at the point of injury and finally escapes\r\nby working its way between the sensitive and insensible laminae to the\r\ntop of the hoof, where an opening is made between the wall and coronary\r\nband at or near the heels. This is the most serious form of corns, for\r\nthe reason that it may induce gangrene of the plantar cushion,\r\ncartilaginous quittor, or caries of the coffin bone.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Since a diversity of opinion exists as to what measures\r\nmust be adopted for the radical cure of corns, the author will advise\r\nthe use of those which have proved most efficient in his hands.\r\n\r\nAs in all other troubles, the cause must be discovered, if possible, and\r\nremoved. In the great majority of cases the shoeing is at fault. While\r\nsudden changes in the method of shoeing are not advisable, it may be\r\nsaid that all errors, either in the preparation of the foot, in the\r\nconstruction of the shoe, or in its application may very properly be\r\ncorrected at any time. Circumstances may at times make it imperative\r\nthat shoes be worn which are not free from objections; as, for\r\ninstance, the shoe with a high calk; but in such cases it is considered\r\nthat the injuries liable to result from the use of calks are less\r\nserious than those which are sure to happen for the want of them.\r\n\r\nFor a sound foot perfectly formed, a flat shoe, with heels less thick\r\nthan the toe, and which rests evenly on the wall proper, is the best. In\r\nflat feet it is often necessary to concave the shoe as much as possible\r\non the upper surface, so that the sole may not be pressed upon. If the\r\nheels are very low the heels of the shoe may be made thicker. If the\r\nfoot is very broad and the wall light toward the heels, a bar shoe\r\nresting upon the frog will aid to prevent excessive tension upon the\r\nsoft tissues when the foot receives the weight of the body. A piece of\r\nleather placed between the foot and shoe serves largely to destroy\r\nconcussion, and its use is absolutely necessary on some animals to\r\nenable them to work.\r\n\r\nLast among the preventive measures may be mentioned those which serve to\r\nmaintain the suppleness of the hoof. The dead horn upon the surface of\r\nthe sole not only retains moisture for a long time, but protects the\r\nliving horn beneath from the effects of evaporation; for this reason the\r\nsole should be pared as little as possible. Stuffing the feet with\r\nflaxseed meal, wet clay, or other like substances, or damp dirt floors\r\nor damp bedding of tanbark, greasy hoof ointments, etc., are all means\r\nwhich may be used to keep the feet from becoming too dry and hard.\r\n\r\nAs to the curative measures which are to be adopted much will depend\r\nupon the extent of the injury. If the case is one of chronic dry corn,\r\nwith but slight lameness, the foot should be poulticed for a day or two\r\nand the discolored horn pared out, care being taken not to injure the\r\nsoft tissues. The heel on the affected side is to be lowered until all\r\npressure is removed and, if the patient's labor is required, the foot\r\nmust be shod with a bar shoe or with one having stiff heels. Care must\r\nbe taken to reset the shoe before the foot has grown too long, else the\r\nshoe will no longer rest on the wall, but on the sole and bar.\r\n\r\nI believe in cutting moist corns out. If there is inflammation, cold\r\nbaths and poultices should be used; when the horn is well softened and\r\nthe fever allayed, pare out the diseased horn, lightly cauterize the\r\nsoft tissues beneath, and poultice the foot for two or three days. When\r\nthe granulations look red, dress the wound with oakum balls saturated in\r\na weak solution of tincture of aloes or spirits of camphor and apply a\r\nroller bandage. Change the dressing every two or three days until a\r\nfirm, healthy layer of new horn covers the wound, when the shoe may be\r\nput on, as in dry corn, and the patient returned to work.\r\n\r\nIn suppurative corns the loosened horn must be removed, so that the pus\r\nmay freely escape. If the pus has worked a passage to the coronary band\r\nand escapes from an opening between the band and hoof, an opening must\r\nbe made on the sole, and cold baths made astringent with a little\r\nsulphate of iron or copper are to be used for a day or two. When the\r\ndischarge becomes healthy, the fistulous tracts may be injected daily\r\nwith a weak solution of bichlorid of mercury, nitrate of silver, etc.,\r\nand the foot dressed as after operation for moist corns. When\r\ncomplications arise, the treatment must be varied to meet the\r\nindications; if gangrene of the lateral cartilage takes place it must be\r\ntreated as directed under the head of cartilaginous quittor; if the\r\nvelvety tissue is gangrenous, it must be cut away; if the coffin bone is\r\nnecrosed, it must be scraped, and the resulting wounds treated on\r\ngeneral principles. After any of the operations for corns have been\r\nperformed, in which the soft tissues have been laid bare, it is best to\r\nprotect the foot by a sole of soft leather set beneath the shoe when the\r\nanimal is returned to work. Only in rare instances are the complications\r\nof corns so serious as to destroy the life or usefulness of the patient.\r\nIt is the wide, flat foot with low heels and thin wall which is most\r\nliable to resist all efforts toward effecting a complete cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUISE OF THE FROG.\r\n\r\nWhen the frog is severely bruised the injury is followed by suppuration\r\nbeneath the horn, and at times by partial gangrene of the plantar\r\ncushion.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--A bruise of the frog generally happens from stepping on a\r\nrough stone or other hard object. It is more liable to take place when\r\ntrotting, running, or jumping than when at a slower pace. A stone wedged\r\nin the shoe and pressing on the frog or between the sides of the frog\r\nand the shoe, if it remains for a time, produces the same results. A cut\r\nthrough the horny frog with some sharp instrument or a punctured wound\r\nby a blunt-pointed instrument may also cause suppuration and gangrene of\r\nthe plantar cushion. Broad, flat feet with low heels and a fleshy frog\r\nare most liable to these injuries.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Lameness, severe in proportion to the extent of the bruise\r\nand the consequent suppuration, is always an early symptom. When the\r\nanimal moves, the toe only is placed to the ground or the foot is\r\ncarried and the patient hobbles along on three legs. When he is at rest,\r\nthe foot is set forward with the toe on the ground and the leg flexed at\r\nthe fetlock joint. As soon as the pus finds its way to the surface the\r\nlameness improves. If the frog is examined early the injured spot may\r\nusually be found; later, if no opening exists, the pus may be discovered\r\nworking its way toward the heels. The horn is loosened from the deeper\r\ntissues, and, if pared through, a thin, yellow, watery and offensive pus\r\nescapes. In other cases a ragged opening is found in the frog, leading\r\ndown to a mass of dead, sloughing tissues, which are pale green in color\r\nif gangrene of the plantar cushion has set in. In rare cases the coffin\r\nbone may be involved in the injury and a small portion of it may become\r\ncarious.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--If the injury is seen at once, the foot should be placed\r\nin a bath of cold water to prevent suppuration. If suppuration has\r\nalready set in, the horn of the frog, and of the bars and branches of\r\nthe sole, if necessary, is to be pared thin so that all possible\r\npressure may be removed, and the foot poulticed. When the pus has\r\nloosened the horn, all the detached portions are to be cut away. If the\r\npus is discharging from an opening near the hair, the whole frog, or\r\none-half of it, will generally be found separated from the plantar\r\ncushion, and is to be removed with the knife. After a few days the\r\ngangrenous portion of the cushion will slough off from the effects of\r\nthe poultice; under rare circumstances only should the dead parts be\r\nremoved by surgical interference. When the slough is all detached, the\r\nremaining wound is to be treated with simple stimulating dressings, such\r\nas tincture of aloes or turpentine, oakum balls, and bandages as\r\ndirected in punctured wounds. When the lameness has subsided, and a thin\r\nlayer of new horn has covered the exposed parts, the foot may be shod.\r\nCover the frog with a thick pad of oakum, held in place by pieces of tin\r\nfitted to slide under the shoe, and return to slow work. Where caries of\r\nthe coffin bone, etc., follow the injury the treatment recommended for\r\nthese complications in punctured wounds of the foot must be resorted to.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUNCTURED WOUNDS OF THE FOOT.\r\n\r\nOf all the injuries to which the foot of the horse is liable, none are\r\nmore common than punctured wounds, and none are more serious than these\r\nmay be when involving the more important organs within the hoof. A nail\r\nis the most common instrument by which the injury is inflicted, yet\r\nwounds may happen from glass, wire, knives, sharp pieces of rock, etc.\r\n\r\nA wound of the foot is more serious when made by a blunt-pointed\r\ninstrument than when the point is sharp, and the nearer the injury is to\r\nthe center of the foot the more liable are disastrous results to follow.\r\nWounds in the heel and in the posterior parts of the frog are attended\r\nwith but little danger, unless they are so deep as to injure the lateral\r\ncartilages, when quittor may follow. Punctured wounds of the anterior\r\nparts of the sole are more dangerous, for the reason that the coffin\r\nbone may be injured, and the suppuration, even when the wound is not\r\ndeep, tends to spread and always gives rise to intense suffering. The\r\nmost serious of the punctured wounds are those which happen to the\r\ncenter of the foot, and which, in proportion to their depth, involve\r\nthe plantar cushion, the plantar aponeurosis, the sesamoid sheath, the\r\nnavicular bone, or the coffin joint.\r\n\r\nPunctured wounds are more liable to be deep in flat or convex feet than\r\nin well-made feet, and as a rule, recovery is neither so rapid nor so\r\ncertain. These wounds are less serious in animals used for heavy draft\r\nthan in those required to do faster work; for the former may be useful,\r\neven if complete recovery is not effected. Lastly, punctured wounds of\r\nthe fore feet are more serious than of the hind feet, for the reason\r\nthat in the former the instrument is liable to enter the foot in a\r\nnearly perpendicular line, and, consequently, is more liable to injure\r\nthe deeper structures of the foot; in the hind foot, the injury is\r\ngenerally near the heels and the wound oblique and less deep.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--A nail or other sharp instrument may penetrate the frog and\r\nremain for several days without causing lameness; in fact, in many cases\r\nof punctured wound of the frog the first evidence of the injury is the\r\nfinding of the nail or the appearance of an opening where the skin and\r\nfrog unite, from which more or less pus escapes. Even when the sole is\r\nperforated, if the injury is not too deep, no lameness develops until\r\nsuppuration is established. In all cases of foot lameness, especially if\r\nthe cause is obscure, the foot should be examined for evidence of\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nThe lameness from punctured wounds, accompanied with suppuration, is\r\ngenerally severe, the patient often refusing to use the affected member\r\nat all. The pain being lancinating in character, he stands with the\r\ninjured foot at rest or constantly moves it back and forth. In other\r\ncases the patient lies down most of the time with the feet outstretched;\r\nthe breathing is rapid, the pulse fast, the temperature elevated, and\r\nthe body covered with patches of sweat.\r\n\r\nWhen the plantar aponeurosis is injured, the pus escapes with difficulty\r\nand the wound shows no signs of healing; the whole foot is hot and very\r\npainful. If the puncture involves the sesamoid sheath, the synovial\r\nfluid escapes. At first this fluid is pure, like joint water, but later\r\nbecomes mixed with the products of suppuration and loses its clear,\r\namber color. Suppuration generally extends up the course of the flexor\r\ntendon, an abscess forms in the hollow of the heel, and finally opens\r\nsomewhere below the fetlock joint. The whole coronet is more or less\r\nswollen, the discharge is profuse and often mixed with blood, yet the\r\nsuffering is greatly relieved from the moment the abscess opens.\r\n\r\nIf the puncture reaches the navicular bone the lameness is intense from\r\nthe beginning; but the only certain way to determine the existence of\r\nthis complication is by the use of the probe; and unless there is a free\r\nescape of synovia it must be used with the greatest of care, else the\r\ncoffin joint may be opened. If the coffin joint has been penetrated,\r\neither by the offending instrument or by the process of suppuration,\r\nacute inflammation of the joint follows, accompanied with high fever,\r\nloss of appetite, etc. The ankle and coronet are now greatly swollen,\r\nand dropsy of the leg to the knee or hock, or even to the body, often\r\nfollows. If the process of suppuration continues, small abscesses appear\r\nat intervals on different parts of the coronet, the patient rapidly\r\nloses flesh, and may die from intense suffering and blood poisoning. In\r\nother cases the suppuration soon disappears, and recovery is effected by\r\nthe joint becoming stiff (anchylosis).\r\n\r\nWhen the wound is forward, near the toe, and deep enough to injure the\r\ncoffin bone, caries always results. The presence of the dead pieces of\r\nbone can be determined by the use of the probe; the bone feels rough and\r\ngritty. Furthermore, there is no disposition upon the part of the wound\r\nto heal.\r\n\r\nBesides the complications above mentioned, others equally as serious may\r\nbe met with. The tendons may soften and rupture, the hoof may slough\r\noff, quittors develop, or sidebones and ringbones grow. Finally,\r\nlaminatis of the opposite foot may happen if the patient persists in\r\nstanding, or lockjaw may cause early death.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In all cases the horn around the seat of injury should be\r\nthinned down, a free opening made for the escape of the products of\r\nsuppuration, and the foot placed in a poultice. If the injury is not\r\nserious, recovery takes place in a few days. When the wound is deeper it\r\nis better to put the foot into a cold bath or under a stream of cold\r\nwater, as advised in the treatment for quittor.\r\n\r\nIf the bone is injured, cold baths, containing about 2 ounces each of\r\nsulphate of copper and sulphate of iron, may be used until the dead bone\r\nis well softened, when it should be removed by an operation. The animal\r\nmust be cast for this operation. The sole is pared away until the\r\ndiseased bone is exposed, when all the dead particles are to be removed\r\nwith a drawing knife, and the wound dressed with 3 per cent compound\r\ncresol solution or a 5 per cent solution of carbolic acid, oakum balls,\r\nand a roller bandage.\r\n\r\nWounds of the bone which are made by a blunt-pointed instrument, like\r\nthe square-pointed cut nail, in which a portion of the surface is driven\r\ninto the deeper parts of the bone, always progress slowly, and should be\r\noperated upon as soon as the conditions are favorable. Even wounds of\r\nthe navicular bone, accompanied with caries, may be operated on and the\r\nlife of the patient saved; but the most skillful surgery is required and\r\nonly the experienced operator should undertake their treatment.\r\n\r\nIf there is an escape of pure synovial fluid from a wound of the sole,\r\nwithout injury to the bone, a small pencil of corrosive sublimate\r\nshould be introduced to the bottom of the wound and the foot dressed as\r\ndirected above.\r\n\r\nThe other complications are to be treated as directed under their proper\r\nheadings.\r\n\r\nAfter healing of the wounds has been effected, lameness, with more or\r\nless swelling of the coronary region, may remain. In such cases the\r\ncoronet should be blistered or even fired with the actual cautery, and\r\nthe patient turned to pasture. If the lameness still persists, and is\r\nnot due to a stiff joint, unnerving may be resorted to in many cases\r\nwith very good results. If the joint is anchylosed, no treatment can\r\nrelieve it, and the patient must either be put to very slow work or kept\r\nfor breeding purposes only.\r\n\r\n\"_Prick in shoeing_\" is an injury which should be considered under the\r\nhead of punctured wounds of the foot. The nails by which the shoe is\r\nfastened to the hoof may produce an injury followed by inflammation and\r\nsuppuration in two days, by penetrating the soft tissues directly or by\r\nbeing driven so deep that the inner layers of the horn of the wall are\r\npressed against the soft tissues with such force as to crush them. In\r\neither case, unless the injury is at the toe, the animal generally goes\r\nlame soon after shoeing, when the first evidence of the trouble may be\r\nthe discharge of pus at the coronet. If lameness follows close upon the\r\nsetting of the shoes, without other appreciable cause, each nail should\r\nbe lightly struck with a hammer, when the one at fault will be detected\r\nby the flinching of the animal.\r\n\r\nTreatment consists in drawing the nail, and if the soft tissues have\r\nbeen penetrated or suppuration has commenced, the horn must be pared\r\naway until the diseased parts are exposed. The foot is now to be\r\npoulticed for a day or two, or until the lameness and suppuration have\r\nceased. If the discharge of pus from the coronet is the first evidence\r\nof the disease, the offending nail must be found and removed, the horn\r\npared out, and a weak solution of carbolic acid or compound cresol\r\ninjected at the coronet until the fistulous tract has healed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTRACTED HEELS, OR HOOFBOUND.\r\n\r\nContracted heels, or hoofbound, is a common disease among horses kept on\r\nhard floor in dry stables, and in such as are subject to much saddle\r\nwork. It consists in an atrophy, or shrinking, of the tissues of the\r\nfoot, whereby the lateral diameter of the heels is diminished. It\r\naffects the fore feet principally; but it is seen occasionally in the\r\nhind feet, where it is of less importance, for the reason that the hind\r\nfoot first strikes the ground with the toe, and consequently less\r\nexpansion of the heels is necessary than in the fore feet, where the\r\nweight is first received on the heels. Any interference with the\r\nexpansibility of this part of the foot interferes with locomotion and\r\nultimately gives rise to lameness. Usually but one foot is affected at\r\na time, but when both are diseased the change is greater in one than in\r\nthe other. Occasionally but one heel, and that the inner one, is\r\ncontracted; in these cases there is less liable to be lameness and\r\npermanent impairment of the animal's usefulness. According to the\r\nopinion of some of the French veterinarians, hoofbound should be divided\r\ninto two classes--total contraction, in which the whole foot is shrunken\r\nin size, and contraction of the heels, when the trouble extends only\r\nfrom the quarters backward. (Pl. XXXV, figs. 4 and 7.)\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Animals raised in wet or marshy districts, when taken to\r\ntowns and kept on dry floors, are liable to have contracted heels, not\r\nalone because the horn becomes dry, but because fever of the feet and\r\nwasting away of the soft tissues result from the change. Another common\r\ncause of contracted heels is to be found in faulty shoeing, such as\r\nrasping the wall, cutting away the frog, heels, and bars; high calks and\r\nthe use of nails too near the heels. Contracted heels may happen as one\r\nof the results of other diseases of the foot; for instance, it often\r\naccompanies thrush, sidebones, ringbones, canker, navicular disease,\r\ncorns, sprains of the flexor tendons, of the sesamoid and suspensory\r\nligaments, and from excessive knuckling of the fetlock joint.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--In contraction of the heels the foot has lost its circular\r\nshape, and the walls from the quarters backward approach to a straight\r\nline. The ground surface of the foot is now smaller than the coronary\r\ncircumference; the frog is pinched between the inclosing heels, is much\r\nshrunken, and at times is affected with thrush. The sole is more concave\r\nthan natural, the heels are higher, and the bars are long and nearly\r\nperpendicular. The whole hoof is dry and so hard that it can scarcely be\r\ncut; the parts toward the heels are scaly and often ridged like the\r\nhorns of a ram, while fissures, more or less deep, may be seen at the\r\nquarters and heels following the direction of the horn fibers. (Plate\r\nXXXVI, fig. 10.) When the disease is well advanced lameness is present,\r\nwhile in the earlier stages there is only an uneasiness evinced by\r\nfrequent shifting of the affected foot. Stumbling is common, especially\r\non hard or rough roads. In most cases the animal comes out of the stable\r\nstiff and inclined to walk on the toe, but after exercise he may go free\r\nagain. He wears his shoes off at the toe in a short time, no matter\r\nwhether he works or remains in the stable. If the shoe is removed and\r\nthe foot pared in old cases, a dry, mealy horn will be found where the\r\nsole and wall unite, extending upward in a narrow line toward the\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--First of all, the preventive measures must be considered.\r\nThe feet are to be kept moist and the horn from drying out by the use of\r\ndamp sawdust or other bedding; by occasional poultices of boiled\r\nturnips, linseed meal, etc., and greasy hoof ointments to the sole and\r\nwalls of the feet. The wall of the foot should be spared from the abuse\r\nof the rasp; the frog, heels, and bars are not to be mutilated with the\r\nknife, nor should calks be used on the shoe except when absolutely\r\nnecessary. The shoes should be reset at least once a month to prevent\r\nthe feet from becoming too long, and daily exercise must be insisted on.\r\n\r\nAs to curative measures, a diversity of opinion exists. A number of\r\nkinds of special shoes have been invented, having for an object the\r\nspreading of the heels, and perhaps any of these, if properly used,\r\nwould eventually effect the desired result. But a serious objection to\r\nmost of these shoes is that they are expensive and often difficult to\r\nmake and apply. The method of treatment which I have adopted is not only\r\nattended with good results, but is inexpensive, if the loss of the\r\npatient's services for a time is not considered a part of the question.\r\nIt consists, first, in the use of poultices or baths of cold water until\r\nthe horn is thoroughly softened. The foot is now prepared for the shoe\r\nin the usual way, except that the heels are lowered a little and the\r\nfrog remains untouched. A shoe, called a \"tip,\" is made by cutting off\r\nboth branches at the center of the foot and drawing the ends down to an\r\nedge. The tapering of the branches should begin at the toe, and the shoe\r\nshould be of the usual width, with both the upper and lower surfaces\r\nflat. This tip is to be fastened on with six or eight small nails, all\r\nset well forward, two being in the toe. With a common foot rasp begin at\r\nthe heels, close to the coronet, and cut away the horn of the wall until\r\nonly a thin layer covers the soft tissues beneath. Cut forward until the\r\nnew surface meets the old 2-1/2 or 3 inches from the heel. The same\r\nsloping shape is to be observed in cutting downward toward the bottom of\r\nthe foot, at which point the wall is to retain its normal thickness. The\r\nfoot is now blistered all round the coronet with Spanish-fly ointment;\r\nwhen this is well set, the patient is to be turned to pasture in a damp\r\nfield or meadow. The blister should be repeated in three or four weeks,\r\nand, as a rule, the patient can be returned to work in two or three\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nThe object of the tip is to throw the weight on the frog and heels,\r\nwhich are readily spread after the horn has been cut away on the sides\r\nof the wall. The internal structures of the foot at the heels, being\r\nrelieved of excessive pressure, regain their normal condition if the\r\ndisease is not of too long standing. The blister tends to relieve any\r\ninflammation which may be present, and stimulates a rapid growth of\r\nhealthy horn, which, in most cases, ultimately forms a wide and normal\r\nheel. In old, chronic cases, with a shrunken frog and increased\r\nconcavity of the sole, accompanied with excessive wasting of all the\r\ninternal tissues of the foot, satisfactory results can not be expected\r\nand are rarely obtained. Still, much relief, if not an entire cure, may\r\nbe effected by these measures.\r\n\r\nWhen thrush is present as a complication, its cure must be sought by\r\nmeasures directed under that heading. If sidebones, ringbones, navicular\r\ndisease, contracted tendons, or other diseases have been the cause of\r\ncontracted heels, treatment will be useless until the cause is removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAND CRACKS.\r\n\r\nA sand crank is a fissure in the horn of the wall of the foot. These\r\nfissures are quite narrow, and, as a general rule, they follow the\r\ndirection of the horny fibers. They may occur on any part of the wall,\r\nbut ordinarily are only seen directly in front, when they are called toe\r\ncracks; or on the lateral parts of the walls, when they are known as\r\nquarter cracks. (Plate XXXVI.)\r\n\r\nToe cracks are most common in the hind feet, while quarter cracks nearly\r\nalways affect the fore feet. The inside quarter is more liable to the\r\ninjury than the outside, for the reason that this quarter is not only\r\nthe thinner, but during locomotion receives a greater part of the weight\r\nof the body. A sand crack may be superficial, involving only the outer\r\nparts of the wall, or it may be deep, involving the whole thickness of\r\nthe wall and the soft tissues beneath.\r\n\r\nThe toe crack is most likely to be complete--that is, extending from the\r\ncoronary band to the sole--while the quarter crack is nearly always\r\nincomplete, at least when of comparatively recent origin. Sand cracks\r\nare most serious when they involve the coronary band in the injury. They\r\nmay be complicated at any time by hemorrhage, inflammation of the\r\nlaminae, suppuration, gangrene of the lateral cartilage and of the\r\nextensor tendon, caries of the coffin bone, or the growth of a horny\r\ntumor known as a keraphyllocele.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Relative dryness of the horn is the principal predisposing\r\ncause of sand cracks. Excessive dryness is perhaps not a more prolific\r\ncause of cracks in the horn than alternate changes from damp to dry. It\r\nis even claimed that these injuries are more common in animals working\r\non wet roads than those working on roads that are rough and dry; at\r\nleast these injuries are not common in mountainous countries. Animals\r\nused to running at pasture when transferred to stables with hard, dry\r\nfloors are more liable to quarter cracks than those accustomed to\r\nstables. Small feet, with thick, hard hoofs, and feet which are\r\nexcessively large, are more susceptible to sand cracks than those of\r\nbetter proportion. A predisposition to quarter cracks exists in\r\ncontracted feet, and in those where the toe turns out or the inside\r\nquarter turns under.\r\n\r\nHeavy shoes, large nails, and nails set too far back toward the heels,\r\ntogether with such diseases as canker, quittor, grease, and suppurative\r\ncorns, must be included as occasional predisposing causes of sand\r\ncracks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXVI.\r\n\r\nQUARTER-CRACK AND REMEDIES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXVII.\r\n\r\nFOUNDERED FEET.]\r\n\r\nFast work on hard roads, jumping, and blows on the coronet, together\r\nwith calk wounds of the feet, are accidental causes of quarter cracks in\r\nparticular. Toe cracks are more likely to be caused by heavy pulling on\r\nslippery roads and pavements or on steep hills.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The fissure in the horn is ofttimes the only evidence of\r\nthe disease; even this may be accidentally or purposely hidden from\r\ncasual view by mud, ointments, tar, wax, putty, gutta-percha, or by the\r\nlong hairs of the coronet.\r\n\r\nSand cracks sometimes commence on the internal face of the wall,\r\ninvolving its whole thickness excepting a thin layer on the outer\r\nsurface. In these cases the existence of the injury may be suspected\r\nfrom a slight depression, which begins near the coronary band and\r\nfollows the direction of the horny fibers; but the trouble can only be\r\npositively diagnosed by paring away the outside layers of horn until the\r\nfissure is exposed. In toe cracks the walls of the fissure are in close\r\napposition when the foot receives the weight of the body, but when the\r\nfoot is raised from the ground the fissure opens. In quarter crack the\r\nopposition is true; the fissure closes when the weight is removed from\r\nthe foot. As a rule, sand cracks begin at the coronary band, and as they\r\nbecome older they not only extend downward, but they also grow deeper.\r\nIn old cases, particularly in toe cracks, the horn on the borders of the\r\nfissure loses its vitality and scales off, sometimes through the greater\r\npart of its thickness, leaving behind a rough and irregular channel\r\nextending from the coronet to the end of the toe.\r\n\r\nIn many cases of quarter crack, and in some cases of toe crack as well,\r\nif the edges remain close together, with but little motion, the fissure\r\nis dry; but in other cases a thin, offensive discharge issues from the\r\ncrack and the ulcerated soft tissues, or a funguslike growth protrudes\r\nfrom the narrow opening.\r\n\r\nWhen the cracks are deep and the motion of their edges considerable, so\r\nthat the soft tissues are bruised and pinched with every movement, a\r\nconstant inflammation of the parts is maintained and the lameness is\r\nsevere.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily the lameness of sand crack is slight when the patient walks,\r\nbut it is greatly aggravated when he is made to trot, and the harder the\r\nroad the worse he limps. Furthermore, the lameness is greater going\r\ndownhill than up, for the reason that these conditions are favorable to\r\nan increased motion in the edges of the fissure. Lastly, more or less\r\nhemorrhage accompanies the inception of a sand crack when the whole\r\nthickness of the wall is involved. Subsequent hemorrhages may also take\r\nplace from fast work, jumping, or a misstep.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--So far as preventive measures are concerned, but little\r\ncan be done. The suppleness of the horn is to be maintained by the use\r\nof ointments, damp floor, bedding, etc. The shoe is to be proportioned\r\nto the weight and work of the animal; the nails holding it in place are\r\nto be of proper size and not driven too near the heels; sufficient calks\r\nand toe pieces must be added to the shoes of horses working on slippery\r\nroads; also, the evils of jumping, fast driving, etc., are to be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nWhen a fissure has made its appearance, means are to be adopted which\r\nwill prevent it from growing longer or deeper; this can only be done by\r\narresting all motion in the edges. The best and simplest artificial\r\nappliance for holding the borders of a toe crack together is the\r\nVachette clasp. These clasps and the instruments necessary for their\r\napplication can be had of any prominent maker of veterinary instruments.\r\n(Pl. XXXVI.) These instruments comprise a cautery iron, with which two\r\nnotches are burned in the wall, one on each side of the crack, and\r\nforceps with which the clasps are closed into place in the bottom of the\r\nnotches and the edges of the fissure brought close together. The clasps,\r\nbeing made of stiff steel wire, are strong enough to prevent all motion\r\nin the borders of the crack. Before these clasps are applied the fissure\r\nshould be thoroughly cleansed and dried, and if the injury is of recent\r\norigin the crack may be filled with a putty made of 2 parts of\r\ngutta-percha and 1 part of gum ammoniac. The number of clasps to be used\r\nis to be determined by the length of the crack, the amount of motion to\r\nbe arrested, etc. Generally the clasps are from one-half to\r\nthree-quarters of an inch apart. The clasps answer equally as well in\r\nquarter crack if the wall is sufficiently thick and not too dry and\r\nbrittle to withstand the strain.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of these instruments and clasps a hole may be drilled\r\nthrough the horn across the fissure and the crack closed with a thin\r\nnail made of tough iron, neatly clinched at both ends. A plate of steel\r\nor brass is sometimes fitted to the parts and fastened on with short\r\nscrews; while this appliance may prevent much gaping of the fissure, it\r\ndoes not entirely arrest motion of the edges, for the reason that the\r\nplate and screw can not be rendered immobile.\r\n\r\nIf, for any reason, the measures above fail or can not be used, recourse\r\nmust be had to an operation. The horn is softened by the use of warm\r\nbaths and poultices, the patient cast, and the walls of the fissure\r\nentirely removed with the knife. The horn removed is in the shape of the\r\nletter V, with the base at the coronet. Care must be taken not to injure\r\nthe coronary band and the laminae. The wound is to be treated with mild\r\nstimulant dressings, such as compound cresol solution, a weak solution\r\nof carbolic acid, tincture of aloes, etc., oakum balls, and a roller\r\nbandage. After a few days the wound will be covered with a new, white\r\nhorn, and only the oakum and bandages will be needed. As the new quarter\r\ngrows out, the lameness disappears, and the patient may be shod with a\r\nbar shoe and returned to work.\r\n\r\nIn all cases of sand crack the growth of horn should be stimulated by\r\ncauterizing the coronary band or by the use of blisters. In simple\r\nquarter crack recovery will often take place if the coronet is\r\nblistered, the foot shod with a \"tip,\" and the patient turned to\r\npasture.\r\n\r\nThe shoe in toe crack should have a clip on each side of the fissure and\r\nshould be thicker at the toe than at the heels. The foot should be\r\nlowered at the heels by paring, and spared at the toe, except directly\r\nunder the fissure, where it is to be pared away until it sets free from\r\nthe shoe.\r\n\r\nWhen any of the complications referred to above arise, special measures\r\nmust be resorted to. For the proper treatment of gangrene of the lateral\r\ncartilage and extensor tendon and caries of the coffin bone reference\r\nmay be had to the articles on quittors. If the horny tumor, known as\r\nkeraphyllocele, should develop, it is to be removed by the use of the\r\nknife. Since this tumor develops on the inside of the horny box and may\r\ninvolve other important organs of the foot in disease, its removal\r\nshould only be undertaken by a skillful surgeon.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAVICULAR DISEASE.\r\n\r\nNavicular disease is an inflammation of the sesamoid sheath, induced by\r\nrepeated bruising or laceration, and complicated in many cases by\r\ninflammation and caries of the navicular bone. In some instances the\r\ndisease undoubtedly begins in the bone, and the sesamoid sheath becomes\r\ninvolved subsequently by an extension of the inflammatory process.\r\n(Plate XXXIV, fig. 5.)\r\n\r\nThe Thoroughbred horse is more commonly affected than any other, yet no\r\nclass or breed of horses is entirely exempt. The mule, however, seems\r\nrarely, if ever, to suffer from it. For reasons which will appear when\r\nconsidering the causes of the disease, the hind feet are not liable to\r\nbe affected. Usually but one fore foot suffers from the disease, but if\r\nboth should be attacked the trouble has become chronic in the first\r\nbefore the second shows signs of the disease.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--To comprehend fully how navicular disease may be caused by\r\nconditions and usages common to nearly all animals, it is necessary to\r\nrecall the peculiar anatomy of the parts involved in the process and the\r\nfunctions which they perform in locomotion.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the fore legs largely support the weight of\r\nthe body when the animal is at rest, and that the faster he moves the\r\ngreater is the shock which the fore feet must receive as the body is\r\nthrown forward by the propelling force of the hind legs. This shock\r\ncould not be withstood by the tissues of the fore feet and legs were it\r\nnot that it is largely dissipated by the elastic muscles which bind the\r\nshoulder to the body, the ease with which the arm closes on the shoulder\r\nblade, and the spring of the fetlock joint. Even these means, however,\r\nare not sufficient within themselves to protect the foot from injury; so\r\nnature has further supplemented them by placing the coffin joint on the\r\nhind part of the coffin bone instead of directly on top of it, whereby a\r\nlarge part of the shock of locomotion is dispersed before it can reach\r\nthe vertical column represented by the cannon, knee, and arm bones. A\r\nstill further provision is made by placing a soft, elastic pad--the frog\r\nand plantar cushion--at the heels to receive the sesamoid expansion of\r\nthe flexor tendon as it is forced downward by the pressure of the\r\ncoronet bone against the navicular. Extraordinary as these means may\r\nappear for the destruction of shock, and ample as they are when the\r\nanimal is at a slow pace or unweighted by rider or load, they fail to\r\nrelieve the parts completely from concussion and excessive pressure\r\nwhenever the opposite conditions are present. The result, then, is that\r\nthe coronet bone forces the navicular hard against the flexor tendon,\r\nwhich, in turn, presses firmly against the navicular as the force of the\r\ncontracting muscles lifts the tendon into place. It is self-evident,\r\nthen, that the more rapid the pace and the greater the load, the greater\r\nmust these contending forces be, and the greater the liability to\r\ninjury. For the same reason horses with excessive knee action are more\r\nliable to suffer from this disease than others, concussion of the foot\r\nand intense pressure on the tendon being common among such horses.\r\n\r\nBesides the above-mentioned exciting causes must be considered those\r\nwhich predispose to the disease. Most prominent among these is heredity.\r\nIt may be claimed, however, that an inherited predisposition to\r\nnavicular disease consists not so much in a special susceptibility of\r\nthe tissues which are involved in the process as in a vice of\r\nconformation which, as is well known, is liable to be transmitted from\r\nparent to offspring. The faults of conformation most likely to be\r\nfollowed by the development of navicular disease are an insufficient\r\nplantar cushion, a small frog, high heels, excessive knee action, and\r\ncontracted heels. Finally, the environments of domestication and use,\r\nsuch as dry stables, heavy pulling, bad shoeing, punctured wounds, etc.,\r\nall have their influence in developing this disease.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--In the early stages of navicular disease the symptoms are\r\ngenerally very obscure. When the disease begins in inflammation of the\r\nnavicular bone, the animal while at rest points the affected foot a\r\ntime before any lameness is seen. While at work he apparently travels as\r\nwell as ever, but when placed in the stable one foot is set out in front\r\nof the other, resting on the toe, with fetlock and knee flexed. After a\r\ntime, if the case is closely watched, the animal takes a few lame steps\r\nwhile at work, but the lameness disappears as suddenly as it came, and\r\nthe driver doubts whether the animal was really lame at all. Later the\r\npatient has a lame spell which may last during a greater part of the\r\nday, but the next morning it is gone; he leaves the stable all right,\r\nbut goes lame again during the day. In times he has a severe attack of\r\nlameness, which may last for a week or more, when a remission takes\r\nplace and it may be weeks or months before another attack supervenes.\r\nFinally, he becomes constantly lame, and the more he is used the greater\r\nthe lameness.\r\n\r\nIn the lameness from navicular disease the affected leg always takes a\r\nshort step, and the toe of the foot first strikes the ground; so the\r\nshoe is most worn at this point. If the patient is made to move\r\nbackward, the foot is set down with exceeding great care, and the weight\r\nrests upon the affected leg but a moment. When exercised he often\r\nstumbles, and if the road is rough he may fall on his knees. If he is\r\nlame in both feet the gait is stilty, the shoulders seem stiff, and, if\r\nmade to work, he sweats profusely from intense pain. Early in the\r\ndevelopment of the disease a careful examination will reveal some\r\nincreased heat in the heels and frog, particularly after work; as the\r\ndisease progresses this becomes more marked, until the whole foot is hot\r\nto the touch. At the same time there is an increased sensibility of the\r\nfoot, for the patient flinches from the percussion of a hammer lightly\r\napplied to the frog and heels or from the pressure of the smith's\r\npincers. The frog is generally shrunken, often of a pale-red color, and\r\nat times is affected with thrush. If the heels are pared away so that\r\nall the weight is received on the frog, or if the same result is\r\nattained by the application of a bar shoe, the animal is excessively\r\nlame. The muscles of the leg and shoulder shrink away and often tremble\r\nas the animal stands at rest. After months of lameness the foot is found\r\nto be shrunken in its diameter and apparently lengthened; the horn is\r\ndry and brittle and has lost its natural gloss, while circular ridges,\r\ndeveloped most toward the heels, cover the upper part of the hoof. When\r\nboth feet are affected the animal points first one foot then the other,\r\nand stands with the hind feet well forward beneath the body, so as to\r\nrelieve the fore feet as much as possible from bearing weight. In old\r\ncases the wasting of the muscles and the knuckling at the fetlock become\r\nso great that the leg can not be straightened and locomotion can\r\nscarcely be performed. The disease generally makes a steady progress\r\nwithout inclining to recovery--the remission of symptoms in the earlier\r\nstages should not be interpreted as evidence that the process has\r\nterminated. The complications usually seen are ringbones, sidebones,\r\nthrush, contracted heels, quartercracks, and fractures of the navicular,\r\ncoronet, and pastern bones.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--But few cases of navicular disease recover. In the early\r\nstages the wall of the heels should be rasped away, as directed in the\r\ntreatment for contracted heels, until the horn is quite thin; the\r\ncoronet should be well blistered with Spanish-fly ointment, and the\r\npatient turned to grass in a damp field or meadow. After three or four\r\nweeks the blister should be repeated. This treatment is to be continued\r\nfor two or three months. Plane shoes are to be put on when the patient\r\nis returned to work. In chronic cases the animal should be put to slow,\r\neasy work. To relieve the pain, neurotomy may be performed--an operation\r\nin which the sense of feeling is destroyed in the foot by cutting out\r\npieces of the nerve at the fetlock. This operation in nowise cures the\r\ndisease, and, since it may be attended with serious results, can be\r\nadvised only in certain favorable cases, to be determined by the\r\nveterinarian.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIDEBONES.\r\n\r\nA sidebone consists in a transformation of the lateral cartilages found\r\non the wings of the coffin bone into bony matter by the deposition of\r\nlime salts. The disease is a common one, especially in heavy horses used\r\nfor draft, in cavalry horses, cow ponies, and other saddle horses, and\r\nin runners and trotters.\r\n\r\nSidebones are peculiar to the fore feet, yet they occasionally develop\r\nin the hind feet, where they are of little importance since they cause\r\nno lameness. In many instances sidebones are of slow growth and, being\r\nunaccompanied with acute inflammation, they cause no lameness until such\r\ntime as, by reason of their size, they interfere with the action of the\r\njoint. (Plate XXXIV, fig. 4.)\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Sidebones often grow in heavy horses without any apparent\r\ninjury, and their development has been attributed to the over-expansion\r\nof the cartilages caused by the great weight of the animal. Blows and\r\nother injuries to the cartilages may set up an inflammatory process\r\nwhich ends in the formation of these bony growths. High-heeled shoes,\r\nhigh calks, and long feet are always classed among the conditions which\r\nmay excite the growth of sidebones. They are often seen in connection\r\nwith contracted heels, ringbones, navicular disease, punctured wounds of\r\nthe foot, quarter cracks, and occasionally as a sequel to founder.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--In the earlier stages of the disease, if inflammation is\r\npresent, the only evidence of the trouble to be detected is a little\r\nfever over the seat of the affected cartilage and a slight lameness. In\r\nthe lameness of sidebones the toe of the foot first strikes the ground\r\nand the step is shorter than natural. The subject comes out of the\r\nstable stiff and sore, but the gait is more free after exercise.\r\n\r\nSince the deposit of bony matter often begins in that part of the\r\ncartilage where it is attached to the coffin bone, the diseased process\r\nmay exist for some time before the bony growth can be seen or felt.\r\nLater, however, the cartilage can be felt to have lost its elastic\r\ncharacter, and by standing in front of the animal a prominence of the\r\ncoronary region at the quarters can be seen. Occasionally these bones\r\nbecome so large as to bulge the hoof outward, and by pressing on the\r\njoint they so interfere with locomotion that the animal becomes entirely\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--So soon as the disease can be diagnosed active treatment\r\nshould be adopted. Cold-water bandages are to be used for a few days to\r\nrelieve the fever and soreness.\r\n\r\nThe improvement consequent on the use of these simple measures often\r\nleads to the belief that the disease has recovered; but with a return to\r\nwork the lameness, fever, etc., reappears. For this reason the use of\r\nblisters, or, better still, the firing iron, should follow on the\r\ndiscontinuance of the cold bandages.\r\n\r\nBut in many instances no treatment will arrest the growth of these bony\r\ntumors, and as a palliative measure neurotomy must be resorted to.\r\nGenerally this operation will so relieve the pain of locomotion that the\r\npatient may be used for slow work; but in animals used for fast driving\r\nor for saddle purposes, the operation is practically useless. Some years\r\nago at Fort Leavenworth I unnerved a number of cavalry horses that were\r\nsuffering from sidebones, and the records show that in less than seven\r\nmonths all were more lame than ever. Since a predisposition to develop\r\nsidebones may be inherited, animals suffering from this disease should\r\nnot be used for breeding purposes unless the trouble is known to have\r\noriginated from an accident.\r\n\r\n\r\nRINGBONE.\r\n\r\nA ringbone is the growth of a bony tumor on the ankle. This tumor is, in\r\nfact, not the disease, but simply the result of an inflammatory action\r\nset up in the periosteum and bone tissue proper of the pastern bones.\r\n(Plate XXXIV, fig. 1.) (See also p. 313.)\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Injuries, such as blows, sprains, overwork in young,\r\nundeveloped animals, fast work on hard roads, jumping, etc., are among\r\nthe principal exciting causes of ringbone. Horses most disposed to this\r\ndisease are those with short, upright pasterns, for the reason that the\r\nshock of locomotion is but imperfectly dissipated in the fore legs of\r\nthese animals. Improper shoeing, such as the use of high calks, a too\r\ngreat shortening of the toe and correspondingly high heels, predispose\r\nto this disease by increasing the concussion to the feet.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The first symptom of an actively developed ringbone is the\r\nappearance of a lameness more or less acute. If the bony tumor forms on\r\nthe side or upper parts of the large pastern, its growth is generally\r\nunattended with acute inflammatory action, and consequently produces no\r\nlameness or evident fever. These are called \"false\" ringbones. But when\r\nthe tumors form on the whole circumference of the ankle, or simply in\r\nfront under the extensor tendon, or behind under the flexor tendons, or\r\nif they involve the joints between the two pastern bones, or between the\r\nsmall pastern and the coffin bone, the lameness is always severe. These\r\nconstitute the true ringbone. Besides lameness, the ankle of the\r\naffected limb presents more or less heat, and in many instances a rather\r\nfirm, though limited, swelling of the deeper tissues over the seat of\r\nthe inflammatory process. The lameness of ringbone is characteristic in\r\nthat the heel is first placed on the ground when the disease is in a\r\nfore leg, and the ankle is kept as rigid as possible. In the hind leg,\r\nhowever, the toe strikes the ground first, when the ringbone is high on\r\nthe ankle, just as in health, but the ankle is maintained in a rigid\r\nposition. If the bony growth is under the front tendon of the hind leg,\r\nor if it involves the coffin joint, the heel is brought to the ground\r\nfirst. In the early stages of the disease it is not always easy to\r\ndiagnose ringbone, but when the deposits have reached some size they can\r\nbe felt and seen as well.\r\n\r\nThe importance of a ringbone depends on its seat and often on its size.\r\nIf it interferes with the joints or with the tendons it may cause an\r\nincurable lameness, even though small. If it is on the sides of the\r\nlarge pastern, the lameness generally disappears as soon as the tumor\r\nhas reached its growth and the inflammation subsides. Even when the\r\npastern joint is involved, if complete anchylosis results, the patient\r\nmay recover from the lameness with simply an imperfect action of the\r\nfoot remaining, due to the stiff joint.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Before the bony growth has commenced the inflammatory\r\nprocess may be cut short by the use of cold baths and wet bandages,\r\nfollowed by one or more blisters. If the bony deposits have begun, the\r\nfiring iron should always be used. Even when the tumors are large and\r\nthe pastern joint involved, firing often hastens the process of\r\nanchylosis and should always be tried.\r\n\r\nWhen the lower joint is involved, or if the tumor interferes with the\r\naction of the tendons, recovery is not to be expected. In many of these\r\nlatter cases, however, the animal may be made serviceable by proper\r\nshoeing. If the patient walks with the toe on the ground, the foot\r\nshould be shod with a high-heeled shoe and a short toe. On the other\r\nhand, if he walks on the heel, a thick-toed and thin-heeled shoe must be\r\nworn.\r\n\r\nSince ringbone is considered to be one of the hereditary diseases, no\r\nanimal suffering from this trouble should ever be used for breeding\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAMINITIS, OR FOUNDER.\r\n\r\nLaminitis is a simple inflammation of the sensitive laminae of the feet,\r\ncharacterized by the general phenomena attending inflammation of the\r\nskin and mucous membranes, producing no constitutional disturbances\r\nexcept those dependent upon the local disease, and having a strong\r\ntendency, in severe cases, to destructive disorganization of the tissues\r\naffected.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--The causes of laminitis are as wide and variable as in any of\r\nthe local inflammations, and may be divided into two classes--the\r\npredisposing and the exciting.\r\n\r\n_Predisposing causes._--From personal observation I do not know that any\r\nparticular construction of foot or any special breed of horses is\r\npredisposed to this disease, neither can I find anything to warrant the\r\nassumption that it is in any way hereditary; so that while we may easily\r\ncultivate a predisposition to the disease, it does not originate without\r\nan exciting cause. Like most other tissues, a predisposition to\r\ninflammation may be induced in the sensitive laminae by any cause which\r\nlessens their power of withstanding the work imposed on them. It exists\r\nto an extent in those animals unaccustomed to work, particularly if they\r\nare plethoric, and in all that have been previous subjects of the\r\ndisease, for the same rule holds good here that we find in so many\r\ndiseases--i. e., that one attack impairs the functional activity of the\r\naffected tissues and renders them more easy of a subsequent\r\ninflammation. Unusual excitement by determining an excessive blood\r\nsupply, bad shoeing, careless paring of the feet by removing the sole\r\nsupport, and high calkings without corresponding toe pieces must be\r\nincluded under this head.\r\n\r\n_Exciting causes._--The exciting causes of laminitis are many and\r\nvaried. The most common are concussion, overexertion, exhaustion, rapid\r\nchanges of temperature, ingestion of certain feeds, purgatives, and the\r\noft-mentioned metastasis.\r\n\r\n(1) Concussion produces this disease by local overstimulation. The\r\nexcessive excitement is followed by an almost complete exhaustion of the\r\nfunctional activity of the laminated tissues, the exhaustion by\r\ncongestion, and eventually by inflammation. But congestion here, as in\r\nall other tissues, is not necessarily followed by inflammation; for,\r\nalthough the principal symptoms belonging to true laminitis are present,\r\nthe congestion may be relieved before the processes of inflammation are\r\nfully established. This is the condition in the many so-called cases of\r\nlaminitis which recover in from 24 to 48 hours. They should be called\r\ncongestion of the laminae.\r\n\r\nLaminitis from concussion is common in trotting horses that are raced\r\nwhen not in condition, especially if they carry the obnoxious toe\r\nweights, and in green horses put to work on city pavements to which they\r\nare unaccustomed. Concussion from long drives on dirt roads is at times\r\nproductive of the same results, notably when the weather is extremely\r\nwarm, or at least when the relative change of temperature is great. But\r\nthe exhaustion of these circumstances must prove an exciting cause as\r\nwell as the long-continued concussion. This combination of causes must\r\nalso determine the disease at times in hunters, for the weight of the\r\nrider increases the demands made upon the function of these tissues, and\r\ntheir powers are the sooner exhausted.\r\n\r\n(2) Overexertion, as heavy pulling or rapid work, even when there is no\r\nimmoderate concussion, occasionally results in this disease. Here also\r\nexhaustion is a conjunctive cause, for overexertion can not be long\r\ncontinued without exhaustion.\r\n\r\n(3) Exhaustion is nearly as prolific a source of laminitis as is\r\nconcussion, for when the physical strength is impaired, even though\r\ntemporarily, some part of the economy is rendered more vulnerable to\r\ndisease than others. To this cause we must ascribe those cases which\r\nfollow a hard day's work, in which at no time has there been\r\noverexertion or immoderate concussion.\r\n\r\nThe tendency to laminitis in horses on sea voyages results from the\r\ncontinual constrained position the animal maintains on account of the\r\nrocking motion of the vessel.\r\n\r\nIf one foot has been blistered, or if one limb is incapacitated from any\r\ncause, the opposite member, doing double duty, soon becomes exhausted,\r\nand congestion, followed by inflammation, results. When one foot only\r\nbecomes laminitic, it is customary to find the corresponding member\r\nparticipating at a later date; not always because of sympathy, but\r\nbecause one foot had to do the work of two.\r\n\r\n(4) Rapid changes of temperature act as an exciting cause of laminitis\r\nby impairing the normal blood supply.\r\n\r\nThis change of temperature may be induced by drinking large quantities\r\nof cold water while in an overheated condition. Here the internal heat\r\nis rapidly reduced, the neighboring tissues and blood vessels\r\nconstrained, and the blood supply to these organs greatly diminished,\r\nwhile the quantity sent to the surface is correspondingly increased.\r\nTrue, in many cases there has not been sufficient labor performed to\r\nimpair the powers of the laminae, and laminitis is more readily induced\r\nthan congestion or inflammation of the skin or other surface organs,\r\nbecause the laminae can not relieve themselves of threatened congestion\r\nby the general safety valve of perspiration. A cold wind or relatively\r\ncold air allowed to play upon the body when heated and wet with sweat\r\nhas virtually the same result, for it arrests evaporation and rapidly\r\ncools the external surface, thereby determining an excess of blood to\r\nsuch organs and tissues as are protected from this outside influence. In\r\nmany instances this happens to be some of the internal organs, as the\r\nlungs, if the previous work has been rapid and their functional activity\r\nimpaired; but in numerous other instances the determination is toward\r\nthe feet, and that it is so depends upon two very palpable facts: First,\r\nthat these tissues have been greatly excited and are already receiving\r\nas much blood as they can accommodate consistently with health; second,\r\neven though these tissues are classed with those of the surface, their\r\nprotection from atmospheric influences by means of the thick box of horn\r\nincasing them renders them in this respect equivalent to internal\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nA more limited local action of cold may excite this disease, by driving\r\nthrough water or washing the feet and legs while the animal is warm or\r\njust in from work. Here a very marked reaction takes place in the\r\nsurface tissues of the limbs, and passive congestion of the foot results\r\nfrom an interference with the return flow of blood which is being sent\r\nto these organs in excess. These are more liable to be simple cases of\r\ncongestion, soon to recover, yet they may become true cases of\r\nlaminitis.\r\n\r\n(5) Why it is that certain kinds of grain will cause laminitis does not\r\nseem to be clearly understood. Certainly they possess no specific action\r\nupon the laminae, for all animals are not alike affected; neither do they\r\nalways produce these results in the same animal. Some of these feeds\r\ncause a strong tendency to indigestion, and the consequent irritation of\r\nthe alimentary canal may be so great as to warrant the belief that the\r\nlaminae are affected through sympathy. In other instances there is no\r\napparent interference with digestion nor evidence of any irritation of\r\nthe mucous membranes, yet the disease is in some manner dependent upon\r\nthe feed for its inception. Barley, wheat, and sometimes corn are the\r\ngrains most liable to cause this disease. With some horses there appears\r\nto be a particular susceptibility to this influence of corn, and the use\r\nof this grain is followed by inflammation of the feet, lasting from a\r\nfew days to two weeks. In these animals, to all appearances healthy, the\r\ncorn neither induces colic, indigestion, nor purging, and apparently no\r\nirritation whatever of the alimentary canal.\r\n\r\n(6) Fortunately purgative medicines rarely cause inflammation of the\r\nlaminae. That it is, then, the result of sympathetic action is no doubt\r\nmore than hypothetical, for when there is no derangement of the\r\nalimentary canal a dose of cathartic medicine will at times bring on\r\nsevere laminitis.\r\n\r\n(7) Almost all the older authorities were agreed that metastatic\r\nlaminitis is a reality. In my opinion metastatic laminitis is nothing\r\nmore nor less than concurrent laminitis, and presents little in any way\r\npeculiar outside the imperfectly understood exciting cause. The\r\npractitioner who allows the acute symptoms of the laminitis to mislead\r\nhim, simply because their severity has overshadowed those of the primary\r\ndisease, may lose his case through unguarded subsequent treatment. This\r\nform of laminitis is by no means commonly met with. It may be found in\r\nconjunction with pneumonia, according to Youatt with inflammation of the\r\nbowels and eyes, and according to Law and Williams sometimes with\r\nbronchitis.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Laminitis is characterized by a congregation of symptoms so\r\nwell marked as scarcely to be misinterpreted by the most casual\r\nobserver. They are nearly constant in their manifestations, modified by\r\nthe number of feet affected, the cause which has induced the disease,\r\nthe previous condition of the patient, and the various other influences\r\nwhich to some extent operate in all diseases. They may be divided into\r\ngeneral symptoms, which are concomitants of all cases of the disease,\r\nsubject to variations in degree only, and special symptoms, or those\r\nwhich serve to determine the feet affected and the complications which\r\nmay arise.\r\n\r\n_General symptoms._--Usually, the first symptom is the interference with\r\nlocomotion. Occasionally the other symptoms are presented first. As the\r\nlameness develops the pulse becomes accelerated, full, hard, and strikes\r\nthe finger strongly; the temperature soon rises several degrees above\r\nthe normal, reaching sometimes 106 deg. F.; it generally ranges between\r\n102.5 deg. and 105 deg. F. The respirations are rapid and panting in character,\r\nthe nostrils widely dilated, and the mucous membranes highly injected.\r\nThe facial expression is anxious and indicative of the most acute\r\nsuffering, while the body is more or less bedewed with sweat. At first\r\nthere may be a tendency to diarrhea, or it may appear later as the\r\nresult of the medicines used. The urine is high colored, scant in\r\nquantity, and of increased specific gravity, owing to the water being\r\neliminated by the skin instead of the kidneys. The appetite is impaired,\r\nsometimes entirely lost, but thirst is greatly increased. The affected\r\nfeet are hot and dry, and as much as possible are relieved from bearing\r\nweight. Rapping them with a hammer, or compelling the animal to stand\r\nupon one affected member, causes intense pain. The artery at the fetlock\r\nthrobs beneath the finger.\r\n\r\n_Special symptoms._--Liability to affection varies in the different feet\r\naccording to the exciting cause. Any one or more of the feet may become\r\nthe subject of this disease, although it appears more often in the fore\r\nfeet than in the hind ones. This is due to the difference of the\r\nfunction, i. e., that the fore feet are the bases of the columns of\r\nsupport, receiving nearly all the body weight during progression and\r\nconsequently most of the concussion, while the hind feet become simply\r\nthe fulcra of the levers of progression, and are almost exempt from\r\nconcussion.\r\n\r\n_One foot._--Injuries and excessive functional performance are the\r\ncauses of the disease in only one foot. The general symptoms, as a rule,\r\nare not severe, there being often no loss of appetite and no unusual\r\nthirst, while the pulse, temperature, and respiration remain about\r\nnormal. The weight of the body is early thrown upon the opposite foot,\r\nand the affected one is extended, repeatedly raised from the floor, and\r\nthen carefully replaced. When made to move forward the lame foot is\r\neither carried in the air while progression is accomplished by hopping\r\nwith the healthy one, or else the heel of the first is placed upon the\r\nground and receives little weight while the sound limb is quickly\r\nadvanced. Progression in a straight line is more easy than turning\r\ntoward the lame side.\r\n\r\n_Both fore feet._--When both fore feet are affected the symptoms are\r\nwell marked. The lameness is excessive and the animal almost immovable.\r\nWhen standing the head hangs low down, or rests upon the manger as a\r\nmeans of support and to relieve the feet; the fore feet are well\r\nextended so that the weight is thrown upon the heels, where the tissues\r\nare least sensitive, least inflamed, and most capable of relief by free\r\neffusion. The hind feet are brought forward beneath the body to receive\r\nas much weight as possible, thereby relieving the diseased ones. If\r\nprogression is attempted, which rarely happens voluntarily during the\r\nfirst three or four days, it is accomplished with very great pain and\r\nlameness at the starting, which usually subsides to an extent after a\r\nfew minutes' exercise. During this exercise, if the animal happens to\r\nstep upon a small stone or other hard substance, he stumbles painfully\r\nand is excessively lame in the offended member for a number of steps,\r\nowing to the acute pain which pressure upon the sole causes in the\r\ntissues beneath. The manner of the progression is pathognomonic of the\r\ncomplaint. Sometimes the affected feet are simultaneously raised from\r\nthe ground (the hind ones sustaining the weight), then advanced a short\r\ndistance and carefully replaced; at almost the same moment the hind ones\r\nare quickly shuffled forward near to the center of gravitation.\r\n\r\nIn other instances one foot at a time is advanced and placed with the\r\nheel upon the ground in the same careful manner, all causes of\r\nconcussion being carefully avoided. In attempting to back the animal he\r\nis found to be almost stationary, simply swaying the body backward on\r\nthe haunches and elevating the toes of the diseased feet as they rest\r\nupon their heels. In attempting to turn either to the right or left he\r\nallows his head to be drawn to the one side to its full extent before\r\nmoving, then makes his hind feet the axis around which the forward ones\r\ndescribe a shuffling circle.\r\n\r\nIn most of cases of laminitis in the fore feet the animal persists in\r\nstanding until he is nearly recovered. In other cases he as persistently\r\nlies, standing only when necessity seems to compel it, and then for as\r\nshort a time as possible. If the recumbent position is once assumed, the\r\nrelief experienced tempts the patient to seek it again; so we often find\r\nhim down a greater part of the time. But this is not true of all cases;\r\nsometimes he will make the experiment, then cautiously guard against a\r\nrepetition. Even in cases of enforced recumbency, he ofttimes takes\r\nadvantage of the first opportunity and gets upon his feet, doggedly\r\nremaining there until again laid upon his side. How to explain this\r\ndiversity of action I do not know; theoretically the recumbent position\r\nis the only appropriate one, except when complications exist, and the\r\none which should give the most comfort, yet it is rejected by very many\r\npatients and, no doubt, for some good reason. It has been suggested as\r\nan explanation that when the animal gets upon his feet after lying for a\r\ntime the suffering is so greatly augmented that the memory of this\r\nexperience deters him from an attempted repetition. If this were true,\r\nthe horse with the first attack must necessarily make the experiment\r\nbefore knowing the after effects of lying down, yet many remain standing\r\nwithout even an attempt at gaining this experimental knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe most-favored position of the animal when down is on the broadside,\r\nwith the feet and legs extended. While in this position the general\r\nsymptoms greatly subside; the respirations and pulse become almost\r\nnormal; the temperature falls and the perspiration dries. It is with\r\ndifficulty that he is made to rise. When he attempts it he gets up\r\nrapidly and \"all of a heap,\" as it were, shifting quickly from one to\r\nthe other foot until they become accustomed to the weight thrown upon\r\nthem. Occasionally a patient will get up like a cow, rising upon the\r\nhind feet first. Although enforced exercise relieves the soreness to\r\nsome extent, it is but temporary, for after a few minutes' rest it\r\nreturns with all its former severity.\r\n\r\n_Both hind feet._--When only both hind feet are affected, they are,\r\nwhile standing, maintained in the same position as when only the fore\r\nones are the subjects of the disease, but with an entirely different\r\nobject in view. Instead of being there to receive weight, they are so\r\nadvanced that the heels only may receive what little weight is\r\nnecessarily imposed on them; the fore feet at the same time are placed\r\nwell back beneath the body, where they become the main supports; the\r\nanimal standing, as Williams describes it, \"all of a heap.\"\r\n\r\nProgression is even more difficult now than when the disease is confined\r\nto the anterior extremities. The fore feet are dubiously advanced a\r\nshort distance and the hind ones brought forward with a sort of kangaroo\r\nhop that results in an apparent loss of equilibrium which the animal is\r\na few moments in regaining. The general symptoms, or, in other words,\r\nthe degree of suffering, seem more severe than when the disease affects\r\nthe fore feet alone. The standing position is not often maintained, the\r\npatient seeking relief in recumbency. This fact is easily understood\r\nwhen we consider how cramped and unnatural is the position he assumes\r\nwhile standing and, if it were maintained for any considerable length of\r\ntime, would, no doubt, excite the disease in the fore feet, as explained\r\nby D'Arboval.\r\n\r\n_All four feet._--Laminitis of all four feet is but uncommonly met with.\r\nThe author has seen but three such cases. In all these the position\r\nassumed was nearly normal. All the feet were slightly advanced, and\r\nfirst one, then another, momentarily raised from the ground and\r\ncarefully replaced, this action being kept up almost continually during\r\nthe time the animal remained standing. The suffering is most acute, the\r\nappetite lost, and, although the patient lies most of the time, the\r\ntemperature remains too high. The pulse and respirations are greatly\r\naccelerated, the body covered with sweat, and bed sores are unpleasant\r\naccompaniments.\r\n\r\n_Course._--The course which laminitis takes varies greatly in different\r\ncases, being influenced more or less by the exciting cause, the animal's\r\nprevious condition, the acuteness of the attack, and the subsequent\r\ntreatment. The first symptoms rarely exhibit themselves while the animal\r\nis at his work, although we occasionally see the gait impaired by\r\nstumbling, the body covered with a profuse sweat, and the respirations\r\nbecome blowing in character as premonitions of the oncoming disease;\r\nbut, as a rule, nothing amiss with the animal is noted until he has\r\nstood for some time after coming in from work, when, in attempting to\r\nmove him, he is found very stiff. Like all congestions, the early\r\nsymptoms usually develop rapidly; yet this is not always the case, for\r\noften there appears to be no well-defined period of congestion, the\r\ndisease seemingly commencing at a point and gradually spreading until a\r\nlarge territory is involved in the morbid process.\r\n\r\n_Simple congestion._--Those cases of simple congestion of the laminae,\r\nwhich we erroneously call laminitis, are rapidly developed, the symptoms\r\nare but moderately severe, and but one to three days are required for\r\nrecovery. There are no structural changes and but a moderate exudate.\r\nThis is rapidly reabsorbed, leaving the parts in the same condition as\r\nthey were previous to the attack. If the congestion has been excessive,\r\na rupture of some of the capillaries will be found, a condition more\r\nliable to exist if the animal is made to continue work after a\r\ndevelopment of symptoms has begun.\r\n\r\nTrue, the majority of these last-described cases prove to be the\r\nlaminitis in fact, yet the congestion may pass away and the extravasated\r\nblood be absorbed without inflammation sufficient to warrant calling it\r\nlaminitis. The seat of greatest congestion will always be found in the\r\nneighborhood of the toe, because of the increased vascularity of that\r\npart, and, although at times it is limited to the podophyllous tissue\r\nalone, any or all parts of the keratogenous membrane may be affected by\r\nthe congestion and followed finally by inflammation.\r\n\r\n_Acute._--In the acute form of laminitis the symptoms may all develop\r\nrapidly, or it may commence by the appearance of a little soreness of\r\nthe feet which in 24 or 48 hours develops into a well-marked case. This\r\npeculiarity of development is due to one of two causes. Either the\r\ncongestion is general, but takes place slowly, or it begins in one or\r\nmore points and gradually spreads throughout the laminae. These acute\r\ncases generally run their course in from one to two weeks. Usually a\r\nculmination of the symptoms is reached, if the patient is properly\r\ntreated, in from three to five days; then evidences of recovery are\r\ndiscernible in favorable cases. The lameness improves, the other\r\nsymptoms gradually subside, and eventually health is regained. It is in\r\nthese cases that a strong tendency to disorganization of a destructive\r\ncharacter exists; hence it is we see so many recover imperfectly, with\r\nmarked structural changes permanently remaining.\r\n\r\n_Subacute._--Subacute laminitis is most often seen as a termination of\r\nthe acute form, although it may exist independent of or precede an acute\r\nattack. It is characterized by the mildness of its symptoms, slow\r\ncourse, and moderate tissue changes. It may be present a long time\r\nbefore any pathological lesions result other than those found in the\r\nacute form, and when these changes do take place they should be viewed\r\nrather as complications.\r\n\r\n_Chronic._--Chronic laminitis is a term used by many to designate any of\r\nthe sequelae of the acute and subacute forms of this disease. Pure,\r\nchronic inflammation of the laminae is not very commonly met with, but is\r\nmost frequent in horses that have long done fast track work. They have\r\n\"fever in the feet\" at all times and are continually sore, both\r\nconditions being aggravated by work. Like chronic inflammation of other\r\nparts, there is a strong tendency to the development of new connective\r\ntissue which, by its pressure upon the blood vessels, interferes with\r\nnutrition. Wasting of the coffin bone and inflammation of its covering\r\nwith caries is not unusual. The continued fever and impaired function of\r\nsecretion result in the production of a horn deficient in elasticity,\r\nsomewhat spongy in character, and inclined to crumble. In some cases of\r\n\"soreness\" in horses used to hard or fast work there is evident weakness\r\nof the coats of the vessels, brought on by repeated functional\r\nexhaustion. Here slight work brings on congestion, which results in\r\nserous effusion and temporary symptoms similar to those of chronic\r\nlaminitis.\r\n\r\n_Complications._--Complications concurrent with or supervening upon\r\nlaminitis are frequent and varied, and are often dependent upon causes\r\nnot fully understood.\r\n\r\n_Excessive purgation_ is one of the simplest of these, and not usually\r\nattended with dangerous consequences. It rarely occurs unless induced by\r\na purgative, and the excessive action of the medicine is probably to be\r\nexplained upon the theory that the mucous membrane sympathizes with the\r\ndiseased laminae, is irritable, and readily becomes overexcited. The\r\ndischarges are thin and watery, sometimes offensively odorous, and\r\noccasionally persist in spite of treatment. It may prove disastrous to\r\nthe welfare of the patient by the rapid exhaustion which it causes,\r\npreventing resolution of the laminitis, and may even cause death.\r\n\r\n_Septicemia and pyemia._--Septicemia and pyemia are unusual\r\ncomplications and are seen only in the most severe cases in which bed\r\nsores are present or suppuration of the laminae results. They die, as a\r\nrule, within three days after showing signs of the complication.\r\n\r\n_Pneumonia._--the so-called metastatic--needs no special consideration,\r\nfor in its lesions and symptoms it does not differ from ordinary\r\npneumonia, although it may be overlooked entirely by the practitioner.\r\nExaminations of the chest should be made every day, so as to detect the\r\ndisease at its onset and render proper aid.\r\n\r\n_Sidebones._--A rapid development of sidebones is one of the\r\ncomplications, or, perhaps better, a sequel of laminitis not often met\r\nwith in practice. Here the inflammatory process extends to the lateral\r\ncartilages, with a strong tendency to calcification. The deposition of\r\nthe lime salts is sometimes most rapid, so that the \"bones\" are\r\ndeveloped in a few weeks; in other instances they are deposited slowly\r\nand their growth is not noted until long after the subsidence of the\r\nlaminitis, so that the exciting cause is not suspected. This change in\r\nthe cartilages may commence as early as the first of the laminitis; and\r\nalthough the trouble in the laminae is removed in the course of a\r\nfortnight the symptoms do not entirely subside, the animal retains the\r\nshuffling gait, the sidebones continue to grow, and the patient usually\r\nremains quite lame. This alteration of the cartilages generally prevents\r\nthe patient from recovering his natural gait, and the practitioner\r\nreceives unjust censure for a condition of affairs he could neither\r\nforesee nor prevent.\r\n\r\nThe laminitic process occasionally extends to the covering of the\r\ncoronet bone, or at least concurrent with and subsequent to laminitis\r\nthe development of \"low ringbone\" is seen, and it is apparently\r\ndependent upon the disease of the laminae for its exciting cause. The\r\nimpairment of function and consequent symptoms are much less marked here\r\nthan in sidebones. The coronet remains hot and sensitive and somewhat\r\nthickened after the laminitis subsides, and a little lameness is\r\npresent. This lameness persists, and the deposits of new bone may\r\nreadily be detected.\r\n\r\n_Suppuration_ of the sensitive membrane is a somewhat common\r\ncomplication, and even when present in its most limited form is always a\r\nserious matter; but when it becomes extensive, and especially when the\r\nsuppurative process extends to the periosteum, the results are liable to\r\nbe fatal. When suppuration occurs the exudation does not appear to be\r\nexcessive. It is rich in leucocytes and seems to have caused detachment\r\nof the sensitive tissues from the horn prior to the formation of pus in\r\nsome instances; in others the tissues are still attached to the horn,\r\nand the suppuration takes place in the deeper tissues.\r\n\r\nLimited suppuration may take place in any part of the sensitive tissues\r\nof the foot during laminitis, and may ultimately be reabsorbed instead\r\nof being discharged upon the surface, but generally the process begins\r\nin the neighborhood of the toe and spreads backward and upward toward\r\nthe coronet, finally separating the horn from the coronary band at the\r\nquarters. At the same time it spreads over the sole and eventually the\r\nentire hoof is loosened and sloughs away, leaving the tissues beneath\r\nentirely unprotected. In other instances--and these are generally the\r\ncases not considered unusually severe--the suppuration begins at the\r\ncoronary band. It extends but a short distance into the tissues, yet\r\ndestroys the patient by separating the hoof from the coronary band, upon\r\nwhich it depends for support and growth. This form of the suppurative\r\nprocess usually begins in front. It is this part of the coronary band\r\nthat is always most actively affected with inflammation, and\r\nconsequently it is here that impairments first occur.\r\n\r\nSuppuration of the sensitive sole is more common than of the sensitive\r\nlaminae and coronary band. It is present in the majority of cases in\r\nwhich there is a dropping of the coffin bone, and in other instances\r\nwhen the effusion at this point is so great as to arrest the production\r\nof horn and uncover the sensitive tissues. Except when the result of\r\ninjury it begins at the toe and spreads backward, and, if not relieved\r\nby opening the sole, escapes at the heel. Suppuration of the sole is\r\nmuch less serious than in other parts of the foot.\r\n\r\nIf the acute constitutional symptoms developed from sloughing of the\r\nfoot do not result in death, a new hoof of very imperfect horn may be\r\ndeveloped after a time; but unless the animal is to be kept for breeding\r\npurposes alone the foot will ever be useless for work and death should\r\nrelieve the suffering. When only the sole sloughs, recovery takes place\r\nwith proper treatment.\r\n\r\n_Peditis._--This is the term that Williams applies to that serious\r\ncomplication of laminitis in which not only the laminae, but the\r\nperiosteum membrane covering the bone and coffin bone also are subjects\r\nof the inflammatory process. Neither is this all; in some of these cases\r\nof peditis acute inflammation of the coffin joint is present, and\r\noccasionally suppuration of the joint. A mild form of periostitis, in\r\nwhich the exudation is in the outer layer of the periosteum only, is a\r\nmore common condition than is recognized generally by practitioners.\r\nIntimate contiguity of structures is the predisposing cause, for the\r\ndisease either spreads from the original seat or the complication occurs\r\nas one of the primary results of the exciting cause. In the severer\r\ncases in which the exudate separates the periosteum from the bone,\r\nsuppuration, gangrene, and superficial caries are common results. If\r\ninfiltration of the bone tissues is rapid the blood supply is cut off by\r\npressure upon the vessels and death of the coffin bone follows. Grave\r\nconstitutional symptoms mark these changes, which soon prove fatal.\r\n\r\nIn the mild cases of periostitis it is by no means easy positively to\r\ndetermine its presence, for there are no special symptoms by which it\r\nmay be distinguished from pure laminitis. In a majority of acute cases,\r\nthough, which show no signs of improvement by the fifth to seventh day,\r\nit is safe to suspect periostitis, particularly if the coronets are very\r\nhot, the pulse full and hard, and the lameness acute. In the fortunately\r\nrare cases in which the bone is affected with inflammation and\r\nsuppuration the agony of the patient is intense; he occupies the\r\nrecumbent position almost continually, never standing for more than a\r\nfew minutes at a time; suffers from the most careful handling of the\r\naffected feet; maintains a rapid pulse and respiration, high\r\ntemperature, loss of appetite, and great thirst. It is in these cases\r\nthat the patient continually grows worse, and the appearance of\r\nsuppuration at the top of the hoof in about two weeks after the\r\ninception of the disease proves the inefficiency of any treatment which\r\nmay have been used and the hopelessness of the case. These patients die\r\nusually between the tenth and twentieth days either from exhaustion or\r\npyemic infection.\r\n\r\n_Gangrene_ occurs in the periosteum as the result of excessive\r\ndetachment from the bone and compression due to excessive exudation.\r\nOther parts of the sensitive tissues are subject occasionally to the\r\nsame fate, and at times large areas will be found dead.\r\n\r\n_Pumiced sole_ is that condition in which the horny sole in the\r\nneighborhood of the toe readily crumbles away and leaves the sensitive\r\ntissues more or less exposed. It is not a complication of laminitis\r\nonly, for it is seen under other conditions. Williams has described the\r\nhorny tissue of pumiced sole as \"weak, cheesy, or spongy, like macerated\r\nhorn, or even grumous (thick, clotted).\" Crumbling horn, when critically\r\nexamined, shows almost an entire absence of the cohesive matter which\r\nunites the healthy fibers, while the fibers themselves are irregular\r\nand granular in appearance. Pumiced sole depends upon an impairment of\r\nthe horn-secreting powers of the sensitive sole or upon a separation of\r\nthe horny from the soft tissues which maintain its vitality.\r\n\r\nPunctured wounds of the foot, accompanied with any considerable\r\ndestruction of the soft tissues, present the same peculiarities of horn\r\nin the immediate neighborhood of the injury. Bruises of the sole are\r\nfollowed by this change when the exudation has been excessive and has\r\nseparated the horn from the living tissues. True, in these cases we\r\nrarely see the soft tissues laid bare, for the reason that new horn is\r\nconstantly secreted and replaces that undergoing disintegration.\r\n\r\nLaminitis presents three conditions under which pumiced sole may appear:\r\nFirst, when free exudation separates the horn from the other tissues, or\r\nwhen the process of inflammation arrests the production of horn by\r\nimpairing or destroying the horn-secreting membrane; second, when\r\ndepression of the coffin bone causes pressure upon and arrests the\r\nformation of horn; and, third, when the elevation of the sole compresses\r\nthe soft tissues against the pedal bone and induces the same condition.\r\n\r\nPumiced sole, from simple exudation and separation of tissues, is of\r\nlittle importance for the reason given above in connection with bruises;\r\nbut when suppuration occurs in restricted portions of the foot in\r\nconjunction with laminitis, it always lays bare the tissues beneath and\r\ntemporarily impairs the animal's value. Recovery takes place after a few\r\nweeks by the tissues \"horning over,\" as in injuries attended by the same\r\nprocess. Depression of the coffin bone is not sufficient within itself\r\nto cause pumiced sole; for, if the relative change in the bone takes\r\nplace slowly, or if the horn is thin, the sole becomes convex from\r\ngradual pressure and the soft tissues adapt themselves to the change\r\nwithout having their function materially impaired. But when the dropping\r\nis sudden and the soft tissues are destroyed, the horn rapidly crumbles\r\naway and the toe of the bone comes through. In many of these cases the\r\nsoft tissues remain uncovered for months. When they are eventually\r\ncovered it is with a thin, slightly adherent horn that stands but little\r\nor no wear. The sole being now convex, the diseased tissues bear unusual\r\nweight by coming in contact with the ground, and hence it is that these\r\nanimals are generally incurable cripples.\r\n\r\nIn most cases in which the sole is raised to meet the pedal bone and\r\npumiced sole occurs it is due not to pressure of the bone from within\r\n(for the tissues are capable of adapting themselves to the gradual\r\nchange) but to impaired vitality of the sensitive tissues from the\r\ninflammation and to the constant concussion and pressure applied from\r\nwithout during progression. To this is to be added the paring away of\r\nthe horn when applying the shoe, thereby keeping the sole at this point\r\ntoo thin.\r\n\r\n_Turning up of the toe._--In many cases of laminitis which have become\r\nchronic it is found that the toe of the foot turns up; that the heels\r\nare longer than natural; while the hoof near the coronary band is\r\ncircled with ridges like the horn of a ram. Even in cases in which\r\nrecovery has taken place, and in other diseases than laminitis, these\r\nridges may be found in the wall of the foot. In such cases, however, the\r\nridges are equally distant from one another all around the foot, while\r\nin turning up of the toe the ridges are wide apart at the heels and\r\nclose together in front, as seen in the figure. (Plate XXXVII, fig. 4.)\r\nThese ridges are produced by periods of interference with the growth of\r\nhorn alternating with periods during which a normal or nearly normal\r\ngrowth takes place. When the toe turns up it is because the coronary\r\nband in front produces horn very slowly, while at the heels it grows\r\nmuch faster, causing marked deformity.\r\n\r\nAnimals so affected always place the abnormally long heel first upon the\r\nground, not alone because the heel is too long, nor as in acute or\r\nsubacute laminitis to relieve the pain, but for the reason that the toe\r\nis too short and lifted away from its natural position. To bring the toe\r\nto the ground the leg knuckles at the fetlock joint.\r\n\r\nThe pain and impairment of function in these cases always result in\r\nmarked atrophy of the muscles of the forearm and shoulder, and to some\r\nextent of the pectorals, while the position of the fore legs advances\r\nthe shoulder joints so far forward as to cause a sunken appearance of\r\nthe breast, which the laity recognize as \"chest founder.\"\r\n\r\nThe lesions of turning up of the toe are permanent, and are the most\r\ninteresting pathologically of all the complications of laminitis.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment of laminitis is probably more varied than of\r\nany other disease, and yet a large number of cases recover for even the\r\npoorest practitioner.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--To guard against and prevent disease, or to render an\r\nunpreventable attack less serious than it otherwise would be, is the\r\nhighest practice of the healing art. In a disease so prone to result\r\nfrom the simplest causes, especially when the soundest judgment may not\r\nbe able to determine the extent of the disease-resisting powers of the\r\ntissues which are liable to be affected, or of what shall in every\r\ninstance constitute an overexcitement, it is not strange that horse\r\nowners find themselves in trouble from unintentional transgression. If\r\nthe disease were dependent upon specific causes, or if the stability of\r\nthe tissues were of a fixed or more nearly determinate quality, some\r\nmeasures might be instituted that would prove generally preventive; but\r\nthe predisposing causes are common conditions and often can not be\r\nremedied. That which is gentle work in one instance may incite disease\r\nin another. That which is feed to-day may to-morrow prove disastrous to\r\nhealth. Finally, necessary medical interference, no matter how\r\njudicious, may cause a more serious complaint than that which was being\r\ntreated. Notwithstanding these difficulties there are some general rules\r\nto be observed that will in part serve to prevent the development of an\r\nunusual number of cases. First of all the predisposing causes must be\r\nremoved when possible; when impossible, unusual care must be taken not\r\nto bring an exciting cause into operation. Under no circumstances should\r\nfat animals have hard work. If the weather is warm or the variation of\r\ntemperature great, all horses should have but slow, gentle labor until\r\nthey become inured to it, the tissues hardened, and their excitability\r\nreduced to a minimum. Green horses should have moderate work,\r\nparticularly when taken from the farm and dirt roads to city pavements;\r\nfor under these circumstances increased concussion, changed hygienic\r\nconditions, and artificial living readily become active causes of the\r\ndisease. Army horses just out of winter quarters, track horses with\r\ninsufficient preparation, and farmers' horses put to work in the spring\r\nare among the most susceptible classes, and must be protected by work\r\nthat is easy and gradual. If long marches or drives are imperative, the\r\nincumbrances must be as light as possible and the journey interspersed\r\nwith frequent rests, for this allows the laminae to regain their impaired\r\nfunctional activity and to withstand much more work without danger.\r\nFurthermore, it permits early detection of an attack, and prevents\r\nworking after the disease begins, which renders subsequent medication\r\nmore effective by cutting the process short at the stage of congestion.\r\n\r\nAll animals when resting immediately after work should be protected from\r\ncold air or drafts. If placed in a stable that is warm and without\r\ndraft, no covering is necessary; under opposite conditions blankets\r\nshould be used until the excitement and exhaustion of labor have\r\nentirely passed away. It is still better that all animals coming in warm\r\nfrom work be \"cooled out\" by slow walking until the perspiration has\r\ndried and the circulation and respiration are again normal. Animals\r\nstopped on the road even for a few moments should always be protected\r\nfrom rapid change of temperature by appropriate clothing. If it can be\r\navoided, horses that are working should never be driven or ridden\r\nthrough water. If unavoidable, they should be cooled off before passing\r\nthrough, and then kept moving until completely dried. The same care is\r\nto be practiced with washing the legs in cold water when just in from\r\nwork, for occasionally it proves to be the cause of a most acute attack\r\nof this disease. Unusual changes in the manner of applying the shoes\r\nshould not be hastily made. If a plane shoe has been worn, high heels or\r\ntoes must not be substituted at once; but the change, if necessary,\r\nshould gradually be made, so that the different tissues may adapt\r\nthemselves to the altered conditions. If radical changes are imperative,\r\nas is sometimes the case, the work must be so reduced in quantity and\r\nquality that it can not excite the disease.\r\n\r\nLaminitis from the effects of purgatives can scarcely be guarded\r\nagainst. I can not determine from the cases in which I have seen this\r\nresult that there are any conditions present that would warn us of\r\ndanger. The trouble does not seem to depend upon the size of the\r\npurgative, the length of time before purgation begins, or the activity\r\nand severity with which the remedy acts. Medicines known to have\r\nunusually irritating effects on the alimentary canal should be used only\r\nwhen necessity demands it, and then in moderate doses.\r\n\r\nExperience alone will determine what animals are liable to suffer from\r\nthis disease through the use of feeds. When an attack can be ascribed to\r\nany particular feed it should be withheld, unless in small quantities.\r\nHorses that have never been fed upon Indian corn should receive but a\r\nlittle of it at a time, mixed with bran, oats, or other feed, until it\r\nhas been determined that no danger exists. Corn is less safe in warm\r\nthan in cold weather, and for this reason it should always be fed with\r\ncaution during spring and summer months.\r\n\r\nWhen an animal is excessively lame in one foot the shoe of the opposite\r\nmember should be removed, and cold water frequently applied to the well\r\nfoot. At the same time, if the subject remains standing, the slings\r\nshould be used. Horses should under no circumstances be overworked; to\r\nguard against this, previous work, nature of roads, state of weather,\r\nand various other influences must be carefully considered. Watering\r\nwhile warm is a pernicious habit, and, unless the animal is accustomed\r\nto it, is liable to result in some disorder, ofttimes in laminitis.\r\n\r\n_Curative measures._--In cases of simple congestion of the laminae the\r\nbody should be warmly clothed and warm drinks administered. The feet\r\nshould be placed in a warm bath to increase the return flow of blood. In\r\ncourse of an hour the feet may be changed to cold water and kept there\r\nuntil recovery is completed. If the constitutional symptoms demand it,\r\ndiuretics should be given. Half-ounce doses of saltpeter three times a\r\nday in the water answer the purpose. In cases of active congestion the\r\nwarm footbaths should be omitted and cold ones used from the\r\ncommencement. Subacute laminitis demands the same treatment, with\r\nlaxatives if there is constipation, and the addition of low-heeled\r\nshoes. The diuretics may need to be continued for some time and their\r\nfrequency increased. Regarding acute laminitis, what has been called the\r\n\"American treatment\" is simple and efficient. It consists solely in the\r\nadministration of large doses of nitrate of potash and the continued\r\napplication to the feet and ankles of cold water.\r\n\r\nThree to four ounces of saltpeter in a pint of water, repeated every six\r\nhours, is a proper dose. The laminitis frequently subsides within a\r\nweek. These large doses may be continued for a week without danger.\r\nUnder no circumstances have I seen the kidneys irritated to excess or\r\nother unfavorable effects produced.\r\n\r\nThe feet should be kept in a tub of water at a temperature of 45 deg. to 50 deg.\r\nF., unless the animal is lying down, when swabs are to be used and wet\r\nevery half hour with the cold water. The water keeps the horn soft and\r\nmoist and acts directly upon the inflamed tissues by reducing the\r\ntemperature. Cold maintains the vitality and disease-resisting qualities\r\nof the soft tissues, tones up the coats of the blood vessels, diminishes\r\nthe supply of blood, and limits the exudation. Furthermore, it has an\r\nanesthetic effect upon the diseased tissues and relieves the pain.\r\n\r\nAconite may be given in conjunction with the niter when the heart is\r\ngreatly excited and beats strongly. Ten-drop doses, repeated every 2\r\nhours for 24 hours, are sufficient. The use of cathartics is dangerous,\r\nfor they may excite superpurgation. Usually the niter will relieve the\r\nconstipation; yet if it should prove obstinate, laxatives may be\r\ncarefully given. Bleeding, both general and local, should be guarded\r\nagainst. The shoes must be early removed and the soles left unpared.\r\n\r\nParing of the soles presents two objections: First, while it may\r\ntemporarily relieve the pain by relieving pressure, it favors greater\r\nexudation, which may more than counterbalance the good effects.\r\nSecondly, it makes the feet tender and subject to bruises when the\r\nanimal again goes to work. The shoes should be replaced when\r\nconvalescence sets in and the animal is ready to take exercise. Exercise\r\nshould never be enforced until the inflammation has subsided; for\r\nalthough it temporarily relieves the pain and soreness it maintains the\r\nirritation, increases the exudation, and postpones recovery.\r\n\r\nIf at the end of the fifth or sixth day prominent symptoms of recovery\r\nare not apparent, apply a stiff blister of cantharides around the\r\ncoronet and omit the niter for about 48 hours. When the blister is well\r\nset, the feet may again receive wet swabs. If one blister does not\r\nremove the soreness it may be repeated, or the actual cautery applied.\r\nThe same treatment should be adopted where sidebones form or\r\ninflammation of the coronet bone follows. When the sole breaks through,\r\nexposing the soft tissues, the feet must be carefully shod with thin\r\nheels and thick toes if there is a tendency to walk on the heels, and\r\nthe sole must be well protected with appropriate dressings and pressure\r\nover the exposed parts. When there is turning up of the toe, blistering\r\nof the coronet, _in front only_, sometimes stimulates the growth of\r\nhorn, but as a rule judicious shoeing is the only treatment that will\r\nenable the animal to do light, slow work.\r\n\r\nWhen suppuration of the laminae is profuse, it is better to destroy your\r\npatient at once and relieve his suffering: but if the suppuration is\r\nlimited to a small extent of tissue, especially of the sole, treatment,\r\nas in acute cases, may induce recovery and should always be tried. If\r\nfrom bed sores or other causes septicemia or pyemia is feared, the\r\nbisulphite of soda, in half-ounce doses, may be given in conjunction\r\nwith tonics and such other treatment as is indicated in these diseases.\r\n\r\nAs to enforced recumbency I doubt the propriety of insisting on it in\r\nthe majority of cases, for I think the patient usually assumes whatever\r\nposition gives most comfort. No doubt recumbency diminishes the amount\r\nof blood sent to the feet, and may greatly relieve the pain, so that\r\nforcing the patient to lie down may be tried, yet should not be renewed\r\nif he thereafter persists in standing.\r\n\r\nWhen the animal persistently stands, or constant lying indicates it (to\r\nprevent extensive sores), the patient should be placed in slings. When\r\nall four feet are affected it may be impossible to use slings, for the\r\nreason that the patient refuses to support any of his weight and simply\r\nhangs in them. Lastly, convalescent cases must not be returned to work\r\ntoo early, else permanent recovery may never be effected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE SKIN.\r\n\r\nBy JAMES LAW, F. R. C. V. S.,\r\n\r\n_Formerly Professor of Veterinary Science, etc., Cornell University._\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we find them described in systematic works, the diseases of the skin\r\nare very numerous and complex, which may be largely accounted for by the\r\nfact that the cutaneous covering is exposed to view at all points, so\r\nthat shades of difference in inflammatory and other diseased processes\r\nare easily seen and distinguished from one another. In the horse the\r\nhairy covering serves to some extent to mask the symptoms, and hence the\r\nnonprofessional man is tempted to apply the term \"mange\" to all alike,\r\nand it is only a step further to apply the same treatment to all these\r\nwidely different disorders. Yet even in the hairy quadruped the\r\ndistinction can be made in a way which can not be done in disorders of\r\nthat counterpart and prolongation of the skin--the mucous membrane,\r\nwhich lines the air passages, the digestive organs, the urinary and\r\ngenerative apparatus. Diseased processes, therefore, which in these\r\norgans it might be difficult or impossible to distinguish from one\r\nanother, can usually be separated and recognized when appearing in the\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nNor is this differentiation unimportant. The cutaneous covering presents\r\nsuch an extensive surface for the secretion of cuticular scales, hairs,\r\nhorn, sebaceous matter, sweat, and other excretory matters, that any\r\nextensive disorder in its functions may lead to serious internal disease\r\nand death. Again, the intimate nervous sympathy of different points of\r\nthe skin with particular internal organs renders certain skin disorders\r\ncausative of internal disease and certain internal diseases causative of\r\naffections of the skin. The mere painting of the skin with an\r\nimpermeable coating of glue is speedily fatal; a cold draft striking on\r\nthe chest causes inflammation of the lungs or pleura; a skin eruption\r\nspeedily follows certain disorders of the stomach, the liver, the\r\nkidneys, or even the lungs; simple burns of the skin cause inflammations\r\nof internal organs, and inflammation of such organs cause in their turn\r\neruptions on the skin. The relations--nervous, secretory, and\r\nabsorptive--between the skin and internal organs are most extensive and\r\nvaried, and therefore a visible disorder in the skin may point at once\r\nand specifically to a particular fault in diet, to an injudicious use of\r\ncold water when the system is heated, to a fault in drainage,\r\nventilation, or lighting of the stables, to indigestion, to liver\r\ndisease, to urinary disorder, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE SKIN AND ITS DISEASES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE OF THE SKIN.\r\n\r\nThe skin consists primarily of two parts: (1) The superficial\r\nnonvascular (without blood vessels) layer, the cuticle, or epidermis;\r\nand (2) the deep vascular (with blood vessels) layer, the corium,\r\ndermis, or true skin. (See Pl. XXXVIII, fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nThe cuticle is made up of cells placed side by side and more or less\r\nmodified in shape by their mutual compression and by surface evaporation\r\nand drying. The superficial stratum consists of the cells dried in the\r\nform of scales, which fall off continually and form dandruff. The deep\r\nstratum (the mucous layer) is formed of somewhat rounded cells with\r\nlarge central nuclei, and in colored skin containing numerous pigment\r\ngranules. These cells have prolongations, or branches, by which they\r\ncommunicate with one another and with the superficial layer of cells in\r\nthe true skin beneath. Through these prolongations they receive nutrient\r\nliquids for their growth and increase, and pass on liquids absorbed by\r\nthe skin into the vessels of the true skin beneath. The living matter in\r\nthe cells exercises an equally selective power on what they shall take\r\nup for their own nourishment and on what they shall admit into the\r\ncirculation from without. Thus, certain agents, like iodin and\r\nbelladonna, are readily admitted, whereas others, like arsenic, are\r\nexcluded by the sound, unbroken epidermis. Between the deep and\r\nsuperficial layers of the epidermis there is a thin, translucent layer\r\n(septum lucidum) consisting of a double stratum of cells, and forming a\r\nmedium of transition from the deep spheroidal to the superficial scaly\r\ncuticle.\r\n\r\nThe true skin, or dermis, has a framework of interlacing bundles of\r\nwhite and yellow fibers, large and coarse in the deeper layers, and fine\r\nin the superficial, where they approach the cuticle. Between the fibrous\r\nbundles are left interspaces which, like the bundles, become finer as\r\nthey approach the surface, and inclose cells, vessels, nerves, glands,\r\ngland ducts, hairs, and in the deeper layers fat.\r\n\r\nThe superficial layer of the dermis is formed into a series of minute,\r\nconical elevations, or papillae, projecting into the deep portion of the\r\ncuticle, from which they are separated by a very fine transparent\r\nmembrane. This papillary layer is very richly supplied with capillary\r\nblood vessels and nerves, and is at once the seat of acute sensation and\r\nthe point from which the nutrient liquid is supplied to the cells of the\r\ncuticle above. It is also at this point that the active changes of\r\ninflammation are especially concentrated; it is the immediately\r\nsuperposed cell layers (mucous) that become morbidly increased in the\r\nearlier stages of inflammation; it is on the surface of the papillary\r\nlayer that the liquid is thrown out which raises the cuticle in the form\r\nof a blister, and it is at this point mainly that pus forms in the\r\nordinary pustule.\r\n\r\nThe fibrous bundles of the true skin contain plain, muscular fibers,\r\nwhich are not controlled by the will, but contract under the influence\r\nof cold and under certain nervous influences, as in some skin diseases\r\nand in the chill of a fever, and lead to contraction, tightening, or\r\ncorrugation of the skin, contributing to produce the \"hidebound\" of the\r\nhorseman. Other minute, muscular filaments are extended from the surface\r\nof the dermis to the hair follicle on the side to which the hair is\r\ninclined, and under the same stimulating influences produce that\r\nerection of the hair which is familiarly known as \"staring coat.\"\r\nBesides these, the horse's skin is furnished with an expansion of red,\r\nvoluntary muscle, firmly attached to the fibrous bundles, and by which\r\nthe animal can not only dislodge insects and other irritants, but even\r\nshake off the harness. This fleshy envelope covers the sides of the\r\ntrunk and the lower portions of the neck and head, the parts unprotected\r\nby the mane and tail, and serves to throw the skin of these parts into\r\npuckers, or ridges, in certain irritating skin diseases.\r\n\r\nThe hairs are cuticular products growing from an enlarged papilla lodged\r\nin the depth of a follicle or sac, hollowed out in the skin and\r\nextending to its deepest layers. The hair follicle is lined by cells of\r\nepidermis, which at the bottom are reflected on the papilla and become\r\nthe root of the hair. The hair itself is formed of the same kind of\r\ncells firmly adherent to one another by a tough, intercellular\r\nsubstance, and overlapping each other, like slates on a roof, in a\r\ndirection toward the free end.\r\n\r\nThe sebaceous glands are branching tubes ending in follicles or sacs and\r\nopening into the hair follicles, lined by a very vascular fibrous\r\nnetwork representing the dermis, and an internal layer of cells\r\nrepresenting the mucous layer of the cuticle. The oily secretion gives\r\ngloss to the hair and prevents its becoming dry and brittle, and keeps\r\nthe skin soft and supple, protecting it at once against undue exhalation\r\nof water and undue absorption when immersed in that medium. Besides\r\nthose connected with the hair follicles there are numerous, isolated,\r\nsebaceous glands, opening directly on the surface of the skin, producing\r\na somewhat thicker and more odorous secretion. They are found in large\r\nnumbers in the folds of the skin, where chafing would be liable if the\r\nsurface were dry, as on the sheath, scrotum, mammary glands, and inner\r\nside of the thigh, around the anus and vulva, in the hollow of the heel,\r\nbeneath the fine horn of the frog, on the inner side of the elbow, on\r\nthe lips, nostrils, and eyelids. When closed by dried secretion or\r\notherwise these glands may become distended so as to form various-sized\r\nswellings on the skin, and when inflamed they may throw out offensive,\r\nliquid discharges, as in \"grease,\" or produce red, tender fungous\r\ngrowths (\"grapes.\")\r\n\r\nThe sweat glands of the horse, like those of man, are composed of simple\r\ntubes, which extend down through the cuticle and dermis in a spiral\r\nmanner, and are coiled into balls in the deeper layer of the true skin.\r\nIn addition to their importance in throwing offensive waste products out\r\nof the system, these glands tend to cool the skin and the entire economy\r\nof the animal through the evaporation of their watery secretion. Their\r\nactivity is therefore a matter of no small moment, as besides regulating\r\nthe animal heat and excreting impurities, they influence largely the\r\ninternal organs through the intimate sympathy maintained between them\r\nand the skin.\r\n\r\nDiseases of the skin may be conveniently divided, according to their\r\nmost marked features, into--\r\n\r\n(1) Those in which congestion and inflammation are the most marked\r\nfeatures, varying according to the grade or form into (a) congestion\r\nwith simple redness, dryness, and heat, but no eruption (erythema);\r\n(b) inflammation with red-pointed elevations, but no blisters\r\n(papules); (c) inflammation with fine, conical elevations, each\r\nsurmounted by a minute blister (vesicle); (d) inflammation with a\r\nsimilar eruption but with larger blisters, like half a pea and upwards\r\n(bullae); (e) inflammation with a similar eruption, but with a small\r\nsac of white, creamy pus on the summit of each elevation (pustules);\r\n(f) the formation of pustules implicating the superficial layer of the\r\ntrue skin, a small portion of which dies and is thrown off as a slough,\r\nor \"core\" (boils); (g) the formation of round, nodular, transient\r\nswellings in the true skin (tubercles); and (h) the excessive\r\nproduction of scales, or dandruff (scaly or squamous affections).\r\n\r\n(2) Diseases in which there are only deranged sensations of itching,\r\nheat, tenderness, etc. (neurosis).\r\n\r\n(3) Diseased growths, such as warts, callosities, horny growths, cancer,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n(4) Diseases from parasites, animal and vegetable.\r\n\r\n(5) Diseases connected with a specific poison, such as horsepox,\r\nerysipelas, anthrax, farcy, or cutaneous glanders, etc.\r\n\r\n(6) Physical injuries, like wounds, burns, scalds, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGESTION (RED EFFLORESCENCE, OR ERYTHEMA).\r\n\r\nThis is a congested or slightly inflamed condition of the skin,\r\nunattended with any eruption. The part is slightly swollen, hot, tender,\r\nor itchy, and dry, and if the skin is white there is redness. The\r\nredness is effaced by pressure, but reappears instantly when it is\r\nremoved. Except in transient cases the hairs are liable to be shed. It\r\nmay be looked on as the first stage of inflammation, and therefore when\r\nit becomes aggravated it may merge in part or in whole into a papular,\r\nvesicular, or pustular eruption.\r\n\r\nErythema may arise from a variety of causes, and is often named in\r\naccordance with its most prominent cause. Thus the chilling, or partial\r\nfreezing, of a part will give rise to a severe reaction and congestion.\r\nWhen snowy or icy streets have been salted this may extend to severe\r\ninflammation, with vesicles, pustules, or even sloughs of circumscribed\r\nportions of the skin of the pastern (chilblain, frost-bite). Heat and\r\nburning have a similar effect, and this often comes from exposure to the\r\ndirect rays of the sun. The skin that does not perspire is the most\r\nsubject, and hence the white face or white limb of a horse becoming\r\ndried by the intensity of the sun's rays often suffers to the exclusion\r\nof the rest of the body (white face and foot disease). The febrile state\r\nof the general system is also a potent cause; hence the white-skinned\r\nhorse is rendered the more liable if kept on a heating ration of\r\nbuckwheat, or even of wheat or maize. Contact of the skin with oil of\r\nturpentine or other essential oils, with irritant liquids, vegetable or\r\nmineral, with rancid fats, with the acrid secretions of certain animals,\r\nlike the irritating toad, with pus, sweat, tears, urine, or liquid\r\nfeces, will produce congestion or even inflammation. Chafing is a common\r\ncause, and is especially liable to affect the fat horse between the\r\nthighs, by the side of the sheath or scrotum, on the inner side of the\r\nelbow, or where the harness chafes on the poll, shoulder, back,\r\nbreastbone, and under the tail. The accumulation of sweat and dust\r\nbetween the folds of the skin and on the surface of the harness, and the\r\nspecially acrid character of the sweat in certain horses, contribute to\r\nchafing or \"intertrigo.\" The heels often become congested owing to the\r\nirritation caused by the short, bristly hairs in clipped heels. Again,\r\ncongestion may occur from friction by halter, harness, or other foreign\r\nbody under the pastern, or inside the thigh or arm, or by reason of\r\nblows from another foot (cutting, interfering, overreach). Finally,\r\nerythema is especially liable to occur in spring, when the coat is being\r\nshed, and the hair follicles and general surface are exposed and\r\nirritable in connection with the dropping of the hairs.\r\n\r\nIf due only to a local irritant, congestion will usually disappear when\r\nthe cause has been removed, but when the feeding or system is at fault\r\nthese conditions must be first corrected. While the coat is being shed\r\nthe susceptibility will continue, and the aim should be to prevent the\r\ndisease from developing and advancing so as to weaken the skin, render\r\nthe susceptibility permanent, and lay the foundation of persistent or\r\nfrequently recurring skin disease. Therefore at such times the diet\r\nshould be nonstimulating, any excess of grain, and above all of\r\nbuckwheat, Indian corn, or wheat, being avoided. A large grain ration\r\nshould not be given at once on return from hard work, when the general\r\nsystem and stomach are unable to cope with it; the animal should not be\r\ngiven more than a swallow or two of cold water when perspiring and\r\nfatigued, nor should he be allowed a full supply of water just after his\r\ngrain ration; he should not be overheated or exhausted by work, nor\r\nshould dried sweat and dust be allowed to accumulate on the skin or on\r\nthe harness pressing on it. The exposure of the affected heels to damp,\r\nmud, and snow, and, above all, to melting snow, should be guarded\r\nagainst; light, smooth, well-fitting harness must be obtained, and where\r\nthe saddle or collar irritates an incision should be made in them above\r\nand below the part that chafes, and, the padding between having been\r\nremoved, the lining should be beaten so as to make a hollow. A zinc\r\nshield in the upper angle of the collar will often prevent chafing in\r\nfront of the withers.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Wash the chafed skin and apply salt water (one-half ounce\r\nto the quart), extract of witch-hazel, a weak solution of oak bark, or\r\ncamphorated spirit. If the surface is raw use bland powders, such as\r\noxid of zinc, lycopodium, starch, or smear the surface with vaseline, or\r\nwith 1 ounce of vaseline intimately mixed with one-half dram each of\r\nopium and sugar of lead. In cases of chafing rest must be strictly\r\nenjoined. If there is constitutional disorder or acrid sweat, 1 ounce\r\ncream of tartar or a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda may be given twice\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGESTION, WITH SMALL PIMPLES, OR PAPULES.\r\n\r\nIn this affection there is the general blush, heat, etc., of erythema,\r\ntogether with a crop of elevations from the size of a poppy seed to a\r\ncoffee bean, visible when the hair is reversed or to be felt with the\r\nfinger where the hair is scanty. In white skins they vary from the\r\npalest to the darkest red. All do not retain the papular type, but some\r\ngo on to form blisters (eczema, bullae) or pustules, or dry up into\r\nscales, or break out into open sores, or extend into larger swellings\r\n(tubercles). The majority, however, remaining as pimples, characterize\r\nthe disease. When very itchy the rubbing breaks them open, and the\r\nresulting sores and scales hide the true nature of the eruption.\r\n\r\nThe general and local causes may be the same as for erythema, and in the\r\nsame subject one portion of the skin may have simple congestion and\r\nanother adjacent papules. As the inflammatory action is more pronounced,\r\nso the irritation and itching are usually greater, the animal rubbing\r\nand biting himself severely. This itching is especially severe in the\r\nforms which attack the roots of the mane and tail, and there the disease\r\nis often so persistent and troublesome that the horse is rendered\r\nvirtually useless.\r\n\r\nThe bites of insects often produce a papular eruption, but in many such\r\ncases the swelling extends wider into a buttonlike elevation, one-half\r\nto an inch in diameter. The same remarks apply to the effects of the\r\npoison ivy and poison sumac.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In papular eruption first remove the cause, then apply the\r\nsame general remedies as for simple congestion. In the more inveterate\r\ncases use a lotion of one-half ounce sulphid of potassium in 2 quarts of\r\nwater, to which a little Castile soap has been added, or use a wash with\r\none-half ounce oil of tar, 2 ounces Castile soap, and 20 ounces water.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION WITH BLISTERS, OR ECZEMA.\r\n\r\nIn this the skin is congested, thickened, warm (white skins are\r\nreddened), and shows a thick crop of little blisters formed by effusions\r\nof a straw-colored fluid between the true skin and the cuticle. The\r\nblisters may be of any size from a millet seed to a pea, and often crack\r\nopen and allow the escape of the fluid, which concretes as a slightly\r\nyellowish scab or crust around the roots of the hairs. This exudation\r\nand the incrustation are especially common where the hairs are long,\r\nthick, and numerous, as in the region of the pastern of heavy draft\r\nhorses. The term eczema is now applied very generally to eruptions of\r\nall kinds that depend on internal disorders or constitutional conditions\r\nand that tend to recurrences and inveteracy. Eczema may appear on any\r\npart of the body, but in horses it is especially common on the heels and\r\nthe lower parts of the limbs, and less frequently on the neck, shoulder,\r\nand abdomen. The limbs appear to be especially liable because of their\r\ndependent position, all blood having to return from them against the\r\naction of gravity and congestions and swellings being common, because of\r\nthe abundance of blood vessels in this part of the skin and because of\r\nthe frequent contact with the irritant dung and urine and their\r\nammoniacal emanations. The legs further suffer from contact with wet and\r\nmud when at work, from snow and ice, from drafts of cold air on the wet\r\nlimbs, from washing with caustic soaps, or from the relaxing effects of\r\na too deep and abundant litter. Among other causes may be named\r\nindigestion and the presence of irritant matters in the blood and sweat,\r\nthe result of patent medicated feeds and condition powders (aromatics,\r\nstimulants), green food, new hay, new oats, buckwheat, wheat, maize,\r\ndiseased potatoes, smut, or ergot in grains, decomposing green feed,\r\nbrewers' grains, or kitchen garbage. The excitement in the skin, caused\r\nby shedding the coat, lack of grooming, hot weather, hot, boiled, or\r\nsteamed feed conduces to the eruption. Lastly, any sudden change of feed\r\nmay induce it.\r\n\r\nThe blisters may in part go on to suppuration so that vesicles and\r\npustules often appear on the same patch, and, when raw from rubbing,\r\nthe true nature of the eruption may be completely masked. In well-fed\r\nhorses, kept in close stables with little work, eczema of the limbs may\r\nlast for months and years. It is a very troublesome affection in draft\r\nstallions.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--This disease is so often the result of indigestion that a\r\nlaxative of 1 pound Glauber's salt in 3 or 4 quarts water or 1-1/2 pints\r\nolive oil is often demanded to clear away irritants from the alimentary\r\ncanal. Following this, in recent and acute cases, give 2 drams of\r\nacetate or bicarbonate of potash twice a day in the drinking water. If\r\nthe bowels still become costive, give daily 1 ounce sulphate of soda and\r\n20 grains of powdered nux vomica. In debilitated horses combine the nux\r\nvomica with one-half ounce powdered gentian root. As a wash for the skin\r\nuse 1 dram bicarbonate of soda and 1 dram carbolic acid in a quart of\r\nwater, after having cleansed the surface with tepid water. Employ the\r\nsame precautions as regards feeding, stabling, and care of harness as in\r\nsimple congestion of the skin.\r\n\r\nIn the more inveterate forms of eczema more active treatment is\r\nrequired. Soak the scabs in fresh sweet oil, and in a few hours remove\r\nthese with tepid water and Castile soap; then apply an ointment of\r\nsulphur or iodid of sulphur day by day. If this seems to be losing its\r\neffect after a week, change for mercurial ointment or a solution of\r\nsulphid of potassium, or of hyposulphite of soda, 3 drams to the quart\r\nof water. In these cases the animal may take a course of sulphur (1\r\nounce daily), bisulphite of soda (one-half ounce daily), or of arsenic\r\n(5 grains daily) mixed with 1 dram bicarbonate of soda.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION WITH PUSTULES.\r\n\r\nIn this affection the individual elevations on the inflamed skin show in\r\nthe center a small sac of white, creamy pus, in place of the clear\r\nliquid of a blister. They vary in size from a millet seed to a hazelnut.\r\nThe pustules of glanders (farcy buds) are to be distinguished by the\r\nwatery contents and the cordlike swelling, extending from the pustules\r\nalong the line of the veins, and those of boils by the inflammation and\r\nsloughing out of a core of the true skin. The hair on the pustule stands\r\nerect, and is often shed with the scab which results. When itching is\r\nsevere the parts become excoriated by rubbing, and, as in the other\r\nforms of skin disease, the character of the eruption may become\r\nindistinct. Old horses suffer mainly at the root of the mane and tail\r\nand about the heels, and suckling foals around the mouth, on the face,\r\ninside the thighs, and under the tail.\r\n\r\nPustules, like eczema, are especially liable to result from unwholesome\r\nfeed and indigestion, from a sudden change of feed--above all, from dry\r\nto green. In foals it may result from overheating of the mare and\r\nallowing the first milk after she returns, or by milk rendered\r\nunwholesome by faulty feeding of the dam. If a foal is brought up by\r\nhand the souring and other decompositions in the milk derange the\r\ndigestion and cause such eruption. Vetches and other plants affected\r\nwith honeydew and buckwheat have been the cause of these eruptions on\r\nwhite portions of the skin. Disorders of the kidneys or liver are common\r\ncauses of this affection.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Apply soothing ointments, such as benzonated oxid of zinc,\r\nor vaseline with 1 dram oxid of zinc in each ounce. Or a wash of 1 dram\r\nsugar of lead or 2 drams hyposulphite of soda in a quart of water may be\r\nfreely applied. If the skin is already abraded and scabby, smear thickly\r\nwith vaseline for some hours, then wash with soapsuds and apply the\r\nabove dressings. When the excoriations are indolent they may be painted\r\nwith a solution of lunar caustic 2 grains to 1 ounce of distilled water.\r\nInternally counteract costiveness and remove intestinal irritants by the\r\nsame means as in eczema, and follow this with one-half ounce doses daily\r\nof hyposulphite of soda, and one-half ounce doses of gentian. Inveterate\r\ncases may often be benefited by a course of sulphur, bisulphite of soda,\r\nor arsenic. In all, the greatest care must be taken with regard to feed,\r\nfeeding, watering, cleanliness, and work. In wet and cold seasons\r\npredisposed animals should, so far as possible, be protected from wet,\r\nmud, snow, and melted snow--above all, from that which has been melted\r\nby salt.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILS, OR FURUNCLES.\r\n\r\nThese may appear on any part of the skin, but are especially common on\r\nthe lower parts of the limbs, and on the shoulders and back where the\r\nskin is irritated by accumulated secretion and chafing with the harness.\r\nIn other cases the cause is constitutional, or attended with unwholesome\r\ndiet and overwork with loss of general health and condition. They also\r\nfollow on weakening diseases, notably strangles, in which irritants are\r\nretained in the system from overproduction of poisons and effete matter\r\nduring fever, and imperfect elimination. There is also the presence of a\r\npyogenic bacterium, by which the disease may be maintained and\r\npropagated.\r\n\r\nWhile boils are pus producing, they differ from simple pustule in\r\naffecting the deepest layers of the true skin, and even the superficial\r\nlayers of the connective tissues beneath, and in the death and sloughing\r\nout of the central part of the inflamed mass (core). The depth of the\r\nhard, indurated, painful swelling, and the formation of this central\r\nmass or core, which is bathed in pus and slowly separated from\r\nsurrounding parts, serve to distinguish the boil alike from the pustule,\r\nfrom the farcy bud, and from a superficial abscess.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--To treat very painful boils a free incision with a lancet\r\nin two directions, followed by a dressing with one-half an ounce\r\ncarbolic acid in a pint of water, bound on with cotton wool or lint, may\r\ncut them short. The more common course is to apply a warm poultice of\r\nlinseed meal or wheat bran, and renew daily until the center of the boil\r\nsoftens, when it should be lanced and the core pressed out.\r\n\r\nIf the boil is smeared with a blistering ointment of Spanish flies and a\r\npoultice put over it, the formation of matter and separation of the core\r\nis often hastened. A mixture of sugar and soap laid on the boil is\r\nequally good. Cleanliness of the skin and the avoidance of all causes of\r\nirritation are important items, and a teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda\r\nonce or twice a day will sometimes assist in warding off a new crop.\r\n\r\n\r\nNETTLERASH (SURFEIT, OR URTICARIA).\r\n\r\nThis is an eruption in the form of cutaneous nodules, in size from a\r\nhazelnut to a hickory nut, transient, with little disposition to the\r\nformation of either blister or pustule, and usually connected with\r\nshedding of the coat, sudden changes of weather, and unwholesomeness or\r\nsudden change in the feed. It is most frequent in the spring and in\r\nyoung and vigorous animals (good feeders). The swelling embraces the\r\nentire thickness of the skin and terminates by an abrupt margin in place\r\nof shading off into surrounding parts. When the individual swellings run\r\ntogether there are formed extensive patches of thickened integument.\r\nThese may appear on any part of the body, and may be general; the\r\neyelids may be closed, the lips rendered immovable, or the nostrils so\r\nthickened that breathing becomes difficult and snuffling. It may be\r\nattended with constipation or diarrhea or by colicky pains. The eruption\r\nis sudden, the whole skin being sometimes covered in a few hours, and it\r\nmay disappear with equal rapidity or persist for six or eight days.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--This consists in clearing out the bowels by 5 drams\r\nBarbados aloes, or 1 pound Glauber's salt, and follow the operation of\r\nthese by daily doses of one-half ounce powdered gentian and 1 ounce\r\nGlauber's salt. A weak solution of alum may be applied to the swellings.\r\n\r\n\r\nPITYRIASIS, OR SCALY SKIN DISEASE.\r\n\r\nThis affection is characterized by an excessive production and\r\ndetachment of dry scales from the surface of the skin (dandruff). It is\r\nusually dependent on some fault in digestion and an imperfect secretion\r\nfrom the sebaceous glands and is most common in old horses with spare\r\nhabit of body. Williams attributes it to feed rich in saccharine matter\r\n(carrots, turnips) and to the excretion of oxalic acid by the skin. He\r\nhas found it in horses irregularly worked and well fed and advises the\r\nadministration of pitch for a length of time and the avoidance of\r\nsaccharine feed. Otherwise the horse may take a laxative followed by\r\ndram doses of carbonate of potash, and the affected parts may be bathed\r\nwith soft, tepid water and smeared with an ointment made with vaseline\r\nand sulphur. In obstinate cases sulphur may be given daily in the feed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRURITUS, OR NERVOUS IRRITATION OF THE SKIN.\r\n\r\nThis is seen in horses fed to excess on grain and hay, kept in close\r\nstables, and worked irregularly. Though most common in summer, it is\r\noften severe in hot, close stables in winter. Pimples, vesicles, and\r\nabrasions may result, but as the itching is quite as severe on other\r\nparts of the skin, these may be the result of scratching merely. It is\r\nespecially common and inveterate about the roots of the mane and tail.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ consists in a purgative (Glauber's salt, 1 pound),\r\nrestricted, laxative diet, and a wash of water slightly soured with oil\r\nof vitriol and rendered sweet by carbolic acid. If obstinate, give daily\r\n1 ounce of sulphur and 20 grains nux vomica. If the acid lotion fails, 2\r\ndrams carbonate of potash and 2 grains of cyanid of potassium in a quart\r\nof water will sometimes benefit. If from pinworms in the rectum, the\r\nitching of the tail may be remedied by an occasional injection of a\r\nquart of water in which chips of quassia wood have been steeped for 12\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERPES.\r\n\r\nThis name has been applied to a disease in which there is an eruption of\r\nminute vesicles in circular groups or clusters, with little tendency to\r\nburst, but rather to dry up into fine scabs. If the vesicles break, they\r\nexude a slight, gummy discharge which concretes into a small, hard scab.\r\nIt is apparently noncontagious and not appreciably connected with any\r\ndisorder of internal organs. It sometimes accompanies or follows\r\nspecific fevers, and is, on the whole, most frequent at the seasons of\r\nchanging the coat--spring and autumn. It is seen on the lips and\r\npastern, but may appear on any part of the body. The duration of the\r\neruption is two weeks or even more, the tendency being to spontaneous\r\nrecovery. The affected part is very irritable, causing a sensitiveness\r\nand a disposition to rub out of proportion to the extent of the\r\neruption.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--It may be treated by oxid of zinc ointment, and to relieve\r\nthe irritation a solution of opium or belladonna in water, or of sugar\r\nof lead or oil of peppermint. A course of bitters (one-half an ounce of\r\nPeruvian bark daily for a week) may be serviceable in bracing the system\r\nand producing an indisposition to the eruption.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLEEDING SKIN ERUPTIONS, OR DERMATORRHAGIA PARASITICA.\r\n\r\nIn China, Hungary, Spain, and other countries horses frequently suffer\r\nfrom the presence of a threadworm (_Filaria haemorrhagica_ Railliet, _F.\r\nmultipapillosa_ Condamine and Drouilly) in the subcutaneous connective\r\ntissue, causing effusions of blood under the scurf skin and\r\nincrustations of dried blood on the surface. The eruptions, which appear\r\nmainly on the sides of the trunk, but may cover any part of the body,\r\nare rounded elevations about the size of a small pea, containing blood\r\nwhich bursts through the scurf skin and concretes like a reddish scab\r\naround the erect, rigid hairs. These swellings appear in groups, which\r\nremain out for several days, gradually diminishing in size; new groups\r\nappear after an interval of three or four weeks, the manifestation being\r\nconfined to three or four months of spring and disappearing in winter. A\r\nhorse will suffer for several years in succession and then permanently\r\nrecover. A fatal issue is not unknown. To find the worm the hair is\r\nshaved from the part where the elevations are felt, and as soon as a\r\nbleeding point is shown the superficial layer is laid open with the\r\nknife, when the parasite will be seen drawing itself back into the parts\r\nbeneath. The worm is about 2 inches long and like a stout thread,\r\nthicker toward the head than toward the tail, and with numerous little\r\nconical elevations (papillae) around the head. The young worms are\r\nnumerous in the body of the adult female worm. The worm has become\r\ncommon in given localities, and probably enters the system with feed or\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ is not satisfactory, but the affected surface should be kept\r\nclean by sponging, and the pressure of harness on any affected part must\r\nbe avoided. Thus rest may become essential. The part may be frequently\r\nwashed with a strong solution of potassium sulphid.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMER SORES FROM FILARIA IRRITANS.\r\n\r\nThe summer sores of horses (dermatitis granulosa, boils) have been\r\ntraced to the presence in the skin of another parasite, 3 millimeters in\r\nlength and extremely attenuated (_Filaria irritans_ Railliet). The sores\r\nmay be seen as small as a millet seed, but more frequently the size of a\r\npea, and may become an inch in diameter. They may appear on any point,\r\nbut are especially obnoxious where the harness presses or on the lower\r\nparts of the limbs. They cause intense and insupportable itching, and\r\nthe victim rubs and bites the part until extensive raw surfaces are\r\nproduced. Aside from such friction the sore is covered by a\r\nbrownish-red, soft, pulpy material with cracks or furrows filled with\r\nserous pus. In the midst of the softened mass are small, firm, rounded\r\ngranulations, fibrinous, and even caseated, and when the soft,\r\npultaceous material has been scraped off, the surface bears a\r\nresemblance to the fine, yellow points of miliary tuberculosis in the\r\nlung. The worm or its debris is found in the center of such masses.\r\nThese sores are very obstinate, resisting treatment for months in\r\nsummer, and even after apparent recovery during the cold season they may\r\nappear anew the following summer. In bad cases the rubbing and biting\r\nmay cause exposure of synovial sacs and tendons, and cause irremediable\r\ninjury. Even in winter, however, when the diseased process seems\r\narrested, there remain the hard, firm, resistant patches of the skin\r\nwith points in which the diseased product has become softened like\r\ncheese.\r\n\r\nThe apparent subsidence of the disease in winter is attributed to the\r\ncoldness and comparative bloodlessness of the skin, whereas in summer,\r\nwith high temperature, active circulation, and rapid cell growth,\r\ninflammation is increased, itching follows, and from the animal rubbing\r\nthe part the irritation is persistently increased. The hotter the\r\nclimate the more troublesome the disease.[4]\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ consists, first, in placing the animal in a cool place and\r\nshowering the surface with cold water. The parasite may be destroyed by\r\nrubbing the surface of the wound with iodoform and covering it with a\r\nlayer of collodion, and repeating the applications very 24 hours for 15\r\ndays, or until the sores heal up. Ether or chloroform, poured on cotton\r\nwool and applied to the sore for two minutes before painting it with\r\ncollodion, may be used in place of iodoform.[5]\r\n\r\n\r\nCRACKED HEELS (SCRATCHES, OR CHAPS ON KNEE AND HOCK).\r\n\r\nThis usually sets in with swelling, heat, and tenderness of the hollow\r\nof the heel, with erections of the hairs and redness (in white skins),\r\nwith stiffness and lameness, which may be extreme in irritable horses.\r\nSoon slight cracks appear transversely, and may gain in depth and width,\r\nand may even suppurate. More frequently they become covered at the\r\nedges or throughout by firm incrustations resulting from the drying of\r\nthe liquids thrown out, and the skin becomes increasingly thick and\r\nrigid. A similar condition occurs behind the knee and in front of the\r\nhock (malanders and salanders), and may extend from these points to the\r\nhoof, virtually incasing that side of the limb in a permanent incrusting\r\nsheath.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Besides a heavy lymphatic constitution, which predisposes to\r\nthis affection, the causes are overfeeding on grain, unwholesome fodder,\r\nclose, hot, dirty stables, constant contact with dung and urine and\r\ntheir emanations, working in deep, irritant mud; above all, in limestone\r\ndistricts, irritation by dry limestones or sandy dust in dry weather on\r\ndirt roads; also cold drafts, snow, and freezing mud, washing the legs\r\nwith caustic soap, wrapping the wet legs in thick woolen bandages which\r\nsoak the skin and render it sensitive when exposed next day, clipping\r\nthe heels, weak heart and circulation, natural or supervening on\r\noverwork, imperfect nourishment, impure air, lack of sunshine, chronic\r\nexhausting, or debilitating diseases, or functional or structural\r\ndiseases of the heart, liver, or kidneys. These last induce dropsical\r\nswelling of the limbs (stocking), weaken the parts, and induce cracking.\r\nFinally the cicatrix of a preexisting crack, weak, rigid, and\r\nunyielding, is liable to reopen under any severe exertion; hence rapid\r\npaces and heavy draft are active causes.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In treatment the first step is to ascertain and remove the\r\ncause whenever possible. If there is much local heat and inflammation, a\r\nlaxative (5 drams aloes or 1 pound Glauber's salt) may be given, and for\r\nthe pampered animal the grain should be reduced or replaced altogether\r\nby bran mashes, flaxseed, and other laxative, nonstimulating feed. In\r\nthe debilitated, on the other hand, nutritious food and bitter tonics\r\nmay be given, and even a course of arsenic (5 grains arsenic with 1 dram\r\nbicarbonate of soda daily). When the legs swell, exercise on dry roads,\r\nhand rubbing, and evenly applied bandages are good, and mild\r\nastringents, like extract of witch-hazel, may be applied and the part\r\nsubsequently rubbed dry and bandaged. If there is much heat but unbroken\r\nskin, a lotion of 2 drams sugar of lead to 1 quart of water may be\r\napplied on a thin bandage, covered in cold weather with a dry one. The\r\nsame may be used after the cracks appear, or a solution of sulphurous\r\nacid 1 part, glycerin 1 part, and water 1 part, applied on cotton and\r\nwell covered by a bandage. In case these should prove unsuitable to the\r\nparticular case, the part may be smeared with vaseline 1 ounce, sugar of\r\nlead 1 dram, and carbolic acid 10 drops.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE HEELS WITH SEBACEOUS SECRETION (GREASE, OR CANKER).\r\n\r\nThis is a specific affection of the heels of horses usually associated\r\nwith the growth of a parasitic fungus, an offensive discharge from the\r\nnumerous sebaceous glands, and, in bad cases, the formation of red, raw\r\nexcrescences (grapes) from the surface. It is to be distinguished (1)\r\nfrom simple inflammation in which the special fetid discharge and the\r\ntendency to the formation of \"grapes\" are absent; (2) from horsepox, in\r\nwhich the abundant exudate forms a firm, yellow incrustation around the\r\nroots of the hair, and is embedded at intervals in the pits formed by\r\nthe individual pocks, and in which there is no vascular excrescence; (3)\r\nfrom foot scabies (mange), in which the presence of an acarus is\r\ndistinctive; (4) from lymphangitis, in which the swelling appears\r\nsuddenly, extending around the entire limb as high as the hock, and on\r\nthe inner side of the thigh along the line of the vein to the groin, and\r\nin which there is active fever, and (5) from erysipelas, in which there\r\nis active fever (wanting in grease), the implication of the deeper\r\nlayers of the skin and of the parts beneath giving a boggy feeling to\r\nthe parts, the absence of the fetid, greasy discharge, and finally a\r\ntendency to form pus loosely in the tissues without any limiting\r\nmembrane, as in abscess. Another distinctive feature of grease is its\r\ntendency to implicate the skin which secretes the bulbs or heels of the\r\nhorny frog and in the cleft of the frog, constituting the disease known\r\nas canker.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--The predisposing causes of grease are essentially the same as\r\nthose of simple inflammation of the heel, so that the reader may consult\r\nthe preceding section. Though a specific fungus and bacteria of\r\ndifferent kinds are present, they tend mainly to aggravation of the\r\ndisease, and are not proved to be essential factors in causation.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms vary according to whether the disease comes on\r\nsuddenly or more tardily. In the first case there is a sudden swelling\r\nof the skin in the heel, with heat, tenderness, itching, and stiffness,\r\nwhich is lessened during exercise. In the slower forms there is seen\r\nonly a slight swelling after rest, and with little heat or inflammation\r\nfor a week or more. Even at this early stage, a slight, serous oozing\r\nmay be detected. As the swelling increases, extending up toward the hock\r\nor knees, the hairs stand erect, and are bedewed by moisture no longer\r\nclear and odorless, but grayish, milky, and fetid. The fetor of the\r\ndischarge draws attention to the part whenever one enters the stable,\r\nand the swollen pastern and wet, matted hairs on the heel draw attention\r\nto the seat of the malady. If actively treated, the disease may not\r\nadvance further, but if neglected the tense, tender skin cracks open,\r\nleaving open sores from which vascular bleeding growths grow up,\r\nconstituting the \"grapes.\" The hair is shed, and the heel may appear\r\nbut as one mass of rounded, red, angry excrescences which bleed on\r\nhandling and are covered with the now repulsively fetid, decomposing\r\ndischarge. During this time there is little or no fever, the animal\r\nfeeds well, and but for its local trouble it might continue at work.\r\nWhen the malady extends to the frog, there is a fetid discharge from its\r\ncleft or from the depressions at its sides, and this gradually extends\r\nto its whole surface and upon the adjacent parts of the sole. The horn\r\nmeanwhile becomes soft, whitish, and fleshy in aspect, its constituent\r\ntubes being greatly enlarged and losing their natural cohesion; it grows\r\nrapidly above the level of the surrounding horn, and when pared is found\r\nto be penetrated to an unusual depth by the secreting papillae, and that\r\nat intervals these have bulged out into a vascular fungous mass\r\ncomparable to the \"grapes.\"\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In treatment hygienic measures occupy a front rank, but\r\nare in themselves insufficient to establish a cure. All local and\r\ngeneral conditions which favor the production and persistence of the\r\ndisease must be guarded against. Above all, cleanliness and purity of\r\nthe stable and air must be obtained; also nourishing diet, regular\r\nexercise, and the avoidance of local irritants--septic, muddy, chilling,\r\netc. At the outset benzoated oxid of zinc ointment may be used with\r\nadvantage. A still better dressing is made with 1 ounce vaseline, 2\r\ndrams oxid of zinc, and 20 drops iodized phenol. If the surface is much\r\nswollen and tender, a flaxseed poultice may be applied, over the surface\r\nof which has been poured some of the following lotion: Sugar of lead,\r\none-half ounce; carbolic acid, 1 dram; water, 1 quart. All the\r\nastringents of the pharmacopoeia have been employed with more or less\r\nadvantage, and some particular one seems to suit particular cases or\r\npatients. To destroy the grapes, they may be rubbed daily with strong\r\ncaustics (copperas, bluestone, lunar caustic), or each may be tied round\r\nits neck with a stout, waxed thread, or, finally and more speedily, they\r\nmay be cut off by a black-smith's shovel heated to redness and applied\r\nwith its sharp edge toward the neck of the excrescence, over a cold\r\nshovel held between it and the skin to protect the skin from the heat.\r\nThe cold shovel must be kept cool by frequent dipping in water. After\r\nthe removal of the grapes the astringent dressing must be persistently\r\napplied to the surface. When the frog is affected, it must be pared to\r\nthe quick and dressed with dry caustic powders (quicklime, copperas,\r\nbluestone) or carbolic acid and subjected to pressure, the dressing\r\nbeing renewed every day at least.\r\n\r\n\r\nERYSIPELAS.\r\n\r\nThis is a specific contagious disease, characterized by spreading,\r\ndropsical inflammation of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, attended\r\nwith general fever. It differs from most specific diseases in the\r\nabsence of a definite period of incubation, a regular course and\r\nduration, and a conferring of immunity on the subject after recovery. On\r\nthe contrary, one attack of erysipelas predisposes to another, partly,\r\ndoubtless, by the loss of tone and vitality in the affected tissues, but\r\nalso, perhaps, because of the survival of the infecting germ.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--It is no longer to be doubted that the microbes found in the\r\ninflammatory product are the true cause of erysipelas, as by their means\r\nthe disease can be successfully transferred from man to animals and from\r\none animal to another. This transition may be direct or through the\r\nmedium of infected buildings or other articles. Yet from the varying\r\nseverity of erysipelas in different outbreaks and localities it has been\r\nsurmised that various different microbes are operative in this disease,\r\nand a perfect knowledge of them might perhaps enable us to divide\r\nerysipelas into two or more distinct affections. At present we must\r\nrecognize it as a specific inflammation due to a bacterial poison and\r\nclosely allied to septicemia. Erysipelas was formerly known as surgical\r\nwhen it spread from a wound (through which the germ had gained access)\r\nand medical, or idiopathic, when it started independently of any\r\nrecognizable lesion. Depending as it does, however, upon a germ distinct\r\nfrom the body, the disease must be looked upon as such, no matter by\r\nwhat channel the germ found an entrance. Erysipelas which follows a\r\nwound is usually much more violent than the other form, the difference\r\nbeing doubtless partly due to the lowered vitality of the wounded\r\ntissues and to the oxidation and septic changes which are invited on the\r\nraw, exposed surface. As apparently idiopathic cases may be due to\r\ninfection through bites of insects, the small amount of poison inserted\r\nmay serve to moderate the violence.\r\n\r\nThis affection may attack a wound on any part of the horse's body,\r\nwhile, apart from wounds, it is most frequent about the head and the\r\nhind limbs. It is to be distinguished from ordinary inflammations by its\r\ngradual extension from the point first attacked, by the abundant liquid\r\nexudation into the affected part, by the tension of the skin over the\r\naffected part, by its soft, boggy feeling, allowing it to be deeply\r\nindented by the finger, by the abrupt line of limitation between the\r\ndiseased and the healthy skin, the former descending suddenly to the\r\nhealthy level instead of shading off slowly toward it, by the tendency\r\nof the inflammation to extend deeply into the subjacent tissues and into\r\nthe muscles and other structures, by the great tendency to death and\r\nsloughing of portions of skin and of the structures beneath, by the\r\nformation of pus at various different points throughout the diseased\r\nparts without any surrounding sac to protect the surrounding structures\r\nfrom its destructive action, and without the usual disposition of pus to\r\nadvance harmlessly toward the surface and escape; and, finally, by a\r\nlow, prostrating type of fever, with elevated temperature of the body,\r\ncoated tongue, excited breathing, and loss of appetite. The pus when\r\nescaping through a lancet wound is grayish, brownish, or reddish, with a\r\nheavy or fetid odor, and inter-mixed with shreds of broken-down tissues.\r\nThe most destructive form, however, is that in which pus is deficient\r\nand gangrene and sloughing more speedy and extensive.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ resolves itself mainly into the elimination from the system\r\nof the poisonous products of the bacteria by laxatives and diuretics,\r\nthe sustaining of the failing vitality by tonics and stimulants, above\r\nall those of the nature of antiferments, and the local application of\r\nastringent and antiseptic agents. Internal treatment may consist in 4\r\ndrams tincture of muriate of iron and one-half dram muriate of ammonia\r\nor chlorate of potash, given in a pint of water every two hours. To this\r\nmay be added, liberally, whisky or brandy when the prostration is very\r\nmarked. Locally a strong solution of iron, alum, or of sulphate of iron\r\nand laudanum may be used; or the affected part may be painted with\r\ntincture of muriate of iron or with iodized phenol. In mild cases a\r\nlotion of 4 drams sugar of lead and 2 ounces laudanum in a quart of\r\nwater may be applied. It is desirable to avoid the formation of wounds\r\nand the consequent septic action, yet when pus has formed and is felt by\r\nfluctuation under the finger to be approaching the surface it should be\r\nfreely opened with a clean, sharp lancet, and the wound thereafter\r\ndisinfected daily with carbolic acid 1 part to water 10 parts, with a\r\nsaturated solution of hyposulphite of soda, or with powders of iodoform\r\nor salol.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORSEPOX, ANTHRAX, AND CUTANEOUS GLANDERS (FARCY).\r\n\r\nThese subjects are discussed under the head of contagious diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALLOSITIES.\r\n\r\nThese are simple thickening and induration of the cuticle by reason of\r\ncontinued pressure, notably in lying down on a hard surface. Being\r\ndevoid of hair, they cause blemishes; hence, smooth floors and good\r\nbedding should be provided as preventives.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORNY SLOUGHS (SITFASTS), OR SLOUGHING CALLOSITIES.\r\n\r\nThese are circumscribed sloughs of limited portions of the skin, the\r\nresult of pressure by badly fitting harness or by irritating masses of\r\ndirt, sweat, and hairs under the harness. They are most common under the\r\nsaddle, but may be found under collar or breeching as well. The sitfast\r\nis a piece of dead tissue which would be thrown off but that it has\r\nformed firm connections with the fibrous skin beneath, or even deeper\r\nwith the fibrous layers (fascia) of the muscles, or with the bones, and\r\nis thus bound in its place as a persistent source of irritation. The\r\nhornlike slough may thus involve the superficial part of the skin only,\r\nor the whole thickness of the skin, and even of some of the structures\r\nbeneath. The first object is to remove the dead irritant by dissecting\r\nit off with a sharp knife, after which the sore may be treated with\r\nsimple wet cloths or a weak carbolic-acid lotion, like a common wound.\r\nIf the outline of the dead mass is too indefinite, a linseed-meal\r\npoultice will make its outline more evident to the operator. If the\r\nfascia or bone has become gangrenous, the dead portion must be removed\r\nwith the hornlike skin. During and after treatment the horse must be\r\nkept at rest or the harness must be so adjusted that no pressure can\r\ncome near the affected parts. (See also page 496.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWARTS.\r\n\r\nThese are essentially a morbid overgrowth of the superficial papillary\r\nlayer of the skin and of the investing cuticular layer. They are mostly\r\nseen in young horses, about the lips, eyelids, cheeks, ears, beneath the\r\nbelly, and on the sheath, but may develop anywhere. The smaller ones may\r\nbe clipped off with scissors and the raw surface cauterized with\r\nbluestone. The larger may be sliced off with a sharp knife, or if with a\r\nnarrow neck they may be twisted off and then cauterized. If very\r\nvascular they may be strangled by a wax thread or cord tied around their\r\nnecks, at least three turns being made around and the ends being fixed\r\nby passing them beneath the last preceding turn of the cord, so that\r\nthey can be tightened day by day as they slacken by shrinkage of the\r\ntissues. If the neck is too broad it may be transfixed several times\r\nwith a double-threaded needle and then be tied in sections. Very broad\r\nwarts that can not be treated in this way may be burned down with a\r\nsoldering bolt at a red heat to beneath the surface of the skin, and any\r\nsubsequent tendency to overgrowth kept down by bluestone.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK PIGMENT TUMORS, OR MELANOSIS.\r\n\r\nThese are common in gray and in white horses on the naturally black\r\nparts of the skin at the roots of the tail, around the anus, vulva,\r\nudder, sheath, eyelids, and lips. They are readily recognized by their\r\ninky-black color, which extends throughout the whole mass. They may\r\nappear as simple, pealike masses, or as multiple tumors aggregating many\r\npounds, especially around the tail. In the horse these are usually\r\nsimple tumors, and may be removed with the knife. In exceptional cases\r\nthey prove cancerous, as they usually are in man.\r\n\r\n\r\nEPITHELIAL CANCER, OR EPITHELIOMA.\r\n\r\nThis sometimes occurs on the lips at the angle of the mouth and\r\nelsewhere in the horse. It begins as a small, wartlike tumor, which\r\ngrows slowly at first, but finally bursts open, ulcerates, and extends\r\nlaterally and deeply in the skin and other tissues, destroying them as\r\nit advances (rodent ulcer). It is made up of a fibrous framework and\r\nnumerous round, ovoid, or cylindrical cavities, lined with masses of\r\nepithelial cells, which may be squeezed out as a fetid, caseous\r\nmaterial. Early and thorough removal with the knife is the most\r\nsuccessful treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE PARASITES OF THE SKIN.\r\n\r\n(Pl. XXXVIII, figs. 2, 3, 4.)\r\n\r\nPARASITE: _Trichophyton tonsurans._ MALADY: _Tinea tonsurans, or\r\ncircinate ringworm._--This is especially common in young horses coming\r\ninto training and work, in low-conditioned colts in winter and spring\r\nafter confinement indoors, during molting, in lymphatic rather than\r\nnervous subjects, and at the same time in several animals that have\r\nherded together. The disease is common to man, and among the domestic\r\nanimals to horse, ox, goat, dog, cat, and in rare instances to sheep and\r\nswine. Hence it is common to find animals of different species and their\r\nattendants suffering at once, the diseases having been propagated from\r\none to the other.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--In the horse the symptoms are the formation of a circular,\r\nscurfy patch where the fungus has established itself, the hairs of the\r\naffected spot being erect, bristly, twisted, broken, or split up and\r\ndropping off. Later the spot first affected has become entirely bald,\r\nand a circular row of hairs around this are erect, bristly, broken, and\r\nsplit. These in turn are shed and a new row outside passes through the\r\nsame process, so that the extension is made in more or less circular\r\noutline. The central bald spot, covered with a grayish scurf and\r\nsurrounded by a circle of broken and split hairs, is characteristic. If\r\nthe scurf and diseased hairs are treated with caustic-potash solution\r\nand put under the microscope, the natural cells of the cuticle and hair\r\nwill be seen to have become transparent, while the groups of spherical\r\ncells and branching filaments of the fungus stand out prominently in the\r\nsubstance of both, dark and unchanged. The eruption usually appears on\r\nthe back, loins, croup, chest, and head. It tends to spontaneous\r\nrecovery in a month or two, leaving for a time a dappled coat from the\r\nspots of short, light-colored hair of the new growth.\r\n\r\nThe most effective way of reaching the parasite in the hair follicles is\r\nto extract the hairs individually, but in the horse the mere shaving of\r\nthe affected part is usually enough. It may then be painted with\r\ntincture of iodin twice a day for two weeks. Germs about the stable may\r\nbe covered up or destroyed by a whitewash of freshly burned quicklime,\r\nthe harness, brushes, etc., may be washed with caustic soda, and then\r\nsmeared with a solution of corrosive sublimate one-half dram and water 1\r\npint. The clothing may be boiled and dried.\r\n\r\nPARASITE: _Achorion schoenleini._ MALADY: _Favus, or honeycomb\r\nringworm._--Megnin and Goyau, who describe this in the horse, say that\r\nit loses its characteristic honeycomb or cup-shaped appearance, and\r\nforms only a series of closely aggregated, dry, yellowish crusts the\r\nsize of hemp seed on the trunk, shoulders, flanks, or thighs. They are\r\naccompanied by severe itching, especially at night. The cryptogam,\r\nformed of spherical cells with a few filaments only, grows in the hair\r\nfollicles and on the cuticle, and thus a crust often forms around the\r\nroot of a hair. Like the other cryptogams, their color, as seen under\r\nthe microscope, is unaffected by acetic acid, alcohol, ether, or oil of\r\nturpentine, while the cells are turned bluish by iodin. For treatment,\r\nremove the hair and apply tincture of iodin or corrosive sublimate\r\nlotion, as advised under the last paragraph.\r\n\r\nPARASITE: _Microsporon furfur._ MALADY: _Parasitic pityriasis._--This\r\nattacks the horse's head where the harness presses, and leads to\r\ndropping of the hair, leaving bald patches covered with a branlike\r\nscurf, without any eruption, heat, tenderness, swelling, or rigidity of\r\nthe skin. A lotion of carbolic acid 1 dram and water 2-1/2 ounces is\r\nusually applied to effect a cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMAL PARASITES OF THE SKIN.[6]\r\n\r\nACARIASIS, OR MANGE.\r\n\r\nThis affection is due to the irritation of the skin caused by the\r\npresence of nearly microscopic acari, or mites. The disease varies,\r\nhowever, according to the species of acarus which infests the skin, so\r\nthat we must treat of several different kinds of acariasis.\r\n\r\nPARASITE: _Sarcoptes scabiei equi._ MALADY: _Sarcoptic acariasis._--This\r\nis the special _Sarcoptes_ of the horse, but under favorable conditions\r\nit can be transmitted to ass and mule, and even to man, and may live\r\nindefinitely on the human skin. The mite (Pl. XXXIX, fig. 1) is nearly\r\nmicroscopical, but may be detected with a magnifying lens among moving\r\nscurf taken from the infected skin. Like all _Sarcoptes_, it burrows\r\nlittle galleries in and beneath the scurf skin, where it hides and lays\r\nits eggs and where its young are hatched. It is therefore often\r\ndifficult to find the parasite on the surface, unless the skin has been\r\nheated by a temporary exposure to the sun or in a warm room. The mite\r\nmay be detected more readily by placing scrapings on black cardboard\r\nand warming, or better by macerating scabs or scrapings in a solution of\r\ncaustic soda or potash and then examining them microscopically. Like\r\nother acari, this is wonderfully prolific, a new generation of fifteen\r\nindividuals being possible every fifteen days, so that in three months\r\nthe offspring of a single pair may produce generations aggregating\r\n1,500,000 young. The _Sarcoptes_ have less vitality than the\r\nnonburrowing acari, as they die in an hour when kept apart from the skin\r\nin dry air at a heat of 145 deg. F. They live 12 to 14 days apart from the\r\nskin in the damp air of a stable. On a piece of damp hide they lived\r\ntill the twenty-fourth day, when they began to die, and all were dead on\r\nthe twenty-eighth.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are an incessant, intolerable, and increasing\r\nitching of some part of the skin (head, mane, tail, back, etc.), the\r\nhorse inclining himself toward the hand that scratches him, and moving\r\nhis lips as if himself scratching. The hairs may be broken and rubbed\r\noff, but the part is never entirely bald, as in ringworm, and there may\r\nbe papules or any kind of eruption or open sores from the energy of the\r\nscratching. Scabs of any thickness may form, but the special features\r\nare the intense itching and the presence of the acarus.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ consists in the removal of the scabs by soapsuds, and, if\r\nnecessary, a brush and the thorough application of tobacco 1-1/2 ounces\r\nand water 2 pints, prepared by boiling. This may be applied more than\r\nonce, and should always be repeated after 15 days, to destroy the new\r\nbrood that may have been hatched in the interval. All harness and stable\r\nutensils should be similarly treated; blankets and rubbers may be\r\nboiled, and the stalls should be covered with a whitewash of quicklime,\r\ncontaining one-fourth pound of chlorid of lime to the gallon.\r\n\r\nWhen there are too many animals to treat by means of hand dressings, the\r\nlime-and-sulphur dip or the tobacco dip may be used and are very\r\neffective, though the cresol dips are fairly effective. These dips may\r\nbe purchased and made up in the dilution called for on the container.\r\nThe affected animals may be dipped when the number warrants it and\r\nfacilities are available; otherwise the dips may be applied with a swab\r\nor a spray pump. Directions for constructing a dipping vat may be\r\nobtained from the United States Department of Agriculture on\r\napplication. Any treatment used should be repeated in the course of 10\r\nto 14 days. If the stables are not disinfected, animals should be\r\nremoved after treatment and put in clean stables or on clean pasture for\r\nat least a month to allow the mites in the infested stables to die.\r\nOtherwise the disease may recur.\r\n\r\nPARASITE: _Psoroptes equi_ (_Dermatocoptes equi_,\r\n_Dermatodectes equi_). MALADY: _Psoroptic\r\nacariasis._--Psoroptic mange is less common than sarcoptic\r\nmange in horses, and as the parasite (Pl. XXXIX, fig. 3) only\r\nbites the surface and lives among the crusts under the shelter of the\r\nhair, it is very easily discovered. It reproduces itself with equal\r\nrapidity and causes similar symptoms to those produced by the\r\n_Sarcoptes_. The same treatment will suffice and is more promptly\r\neffectual. The purifying of the stable must be more thorough, as the\r\n_Psoroptes_ will survive twenty to thirty days in the moist atmosphere\r\nof a stable, and may even revive after six or eight weeks when subjected\r\nto moist warmth. Infested pastures will therefore prove dangerous to\r\nhorses for that length of time, and, with rubbing posts, etc, should not\r\nbe used.\r\n\r\nPARASITE: _Chorioptes equi_ (_Symbiotes equi_, _Dermatophagus equi_,\r\n_Chorioptes spathiferus_). MALADY: _Foot mange._--The acarus (Pl. XXXIX,\r\nfig. 2) attacks the heels and lower parts of the legs, especially the\r\nhind ones, and may be present for years without extending upon the body.\r\nLike the _Psoroptes_; it lives on the surface, on the hairs, and among\r\nthe scabs. It gives rise to great itching, stamping, rubbing of the one\r\nleg with the other, and the formation of papules, wounds, ulcerous\r\nsores, and scabs. The intense itching will always suggest this parasite,\r\nand the discovery of the acarus will identify the disease. The treatment\r\nis the same as for the _Sarcoptes_, but may be confined to the legs and\r\nthe parts with which they come in contact.\r\n\r\nPARASITE: _Dermanyssus gallinae, or chicken acari._ MALADY: _Poultry\r\nacariasis._--This is a large-sized acarus, though usually miscalled \"hen\r\nlouse,\" and the disease \"poultry lousiness.\" The mite (Pl. XXXIX, fig.\r\n4) lives in droppings and in crevices of chicken houses, but temporarily\r\npasses on to the skin of man and of the horse and other quadrupeds, when\r\noccasion serves. It causes much irritation, with the eruption of papules\r\nor vesicles and the formation of sores and scabs. The examination of the\r\nskin is usually fruitless, as the attacks are mostly made at night and\r\nthe effects only may be seen during the day. The proximity of hen manure\r\nswarming with the acari explains the trouble, and the removal of this\r\nand a white-washing with quicklime, with or without chlorid of lime,\r\nwill prevent future attacks. The skin may still require bland ointments\r\nor lotions, as for congestion.\r\n\r\nPARASITE: _Larva of a Trombidium, Leptus americanus, or harvest bug,\r\nmisnamed jigger (chigoe)._ MALADY: _Autumn mange._--This parasite is a\r\nbrick-red acarus, visible to the naked eye on a dark ground, and living\r\non green vegetation in many localities. It attacks man, and the horse,\r\nox, dog, etc., burrowing under the skin and giving rise to small papules\r\nand intolerable irritation. This continues for two or three days only\r\nfrom a single invasion, but will last until cold weather sets in if\r\nthere is a fresh invasion daily. Horses at pasture suffer mainly on the\r\nlower part of the face. If kept indoors the disease will disappear, or\r\nif left at pasture a weak tar water or solution of tobacco may be\r\napplied to the face.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXIX.\r\n\r\nMITES THAT INFEST THE HORSE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTICKS.\r\n\r\nThe wood ticks are familiar to inhabitants of uncultivated lands, and\r\nprove troublesome parasites to man and beast alike. The tick lives on\r\nbushes, and attaches itself to the mammal only to secure a feast of\r\nblood, for when gorged it drops off to sleep off its debauch on the\r\nsoil. The tick produces great irritation by boring into the skin with\r\nits armed proboscis. If pulled out, the head and thorax are often left\r\nin the skin. They may be covered with oil to shut out the air from their\r\nbreathing pores, or by touching them with a hot penknife they will be\r\nimpelled to let go their hold.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRUBS IN SKIN.\r\n\r\nPARASITE: _Hypoderma lineata_. MALADY: _Larvae_ (_grubs_) _under the\r\nskin_.--The larvae of a fly (probably _Hypoderma lineata_, whose larvae in\r\nthe skin of cattle are commonly known as \"warbles\") are occasionally\r\nfound in little sacs beneath the skin of horses. The mature larva\r\nescapes in early summer and develops into a fly. In districts where they\r\nexist the grubs should be pressed out of the skin in the course of the\r\nwinter and destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARVAE (GRUBS) ON THE SKIN, OR FLYBLOW.\r\n\r\nThe following flies, among others, deposit their eggs on open sores or\r\non wet, filthy parts of the skin, where their larvae or grubs give rise\r\nto serious trouble: _Lucilia caesar_ (bluebottle), _Cochliomyia\r\nmacellaria_ (screwworm fly), _Musca vomitoria_ (meat fly), and\r\n_Sarcophaga carnaria_ (flesh fly). To prevent their attacks, wet, filthy\r\nhair should be removed and wounds kept clean and rendered antiseptic by\r\na lotion of carbolic acid 1 part, water 50 parts, or by a mixture of 1\r\nounce oil of tar in 20 ounces sweet oil, or by some other antiseptic. If\r\nthe grubs are already present they should be picked off and one of these\r\ndressings freely applied.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLIES.\r\n\r\nA number of flies attack horses and suck their blood, producing great\r\nannoyance and in some instances death. These insects not only suck the\r\nblood, but also often instill an acid poison into the skin, and in\r\nexceptional cases transfer infectious germs from animal to animal by\r\ninoculation.\r\n\r\nVarious devices are resorted to to prevent the attacks, as to sponge the\r\nskin with a decoction of walnut or elder leaves, of tobacco, to dust\r\nwith Persian insect powder, to keep a light blanket or fly net on the\r\nhorse, to close doors and windows with fine screens and destroy by\r\npyrethrum any flies that have gained admission, to remove all manure\r\nheaps that would prove breeding places for flies, to keep the stalls\r\nclean, deodorize by gypsum, and to spread in them trays of dry chlorid\r\nof lime. For the poisoned bites apply ammonia, or a solution of 1 part\r\nof carbolic acid in 20 parts of sweet oil or glycerin, or one-fourth\r\nounce bicarbonate of soda and 1 dram of carbolic acid in a quart of\r\nwater may be used.\r\n\r\nA large number of fly repellents have been recommended, but most of them\r\nmust be applied daily in order to maintain the protective effect. Among\r\nthe things used are carbolic solutions, pine tar, oil of tar, fish oil,\r\nlaurel oil, oil of citronella, oil of sassafras, oil of camphor, and\r\ncod-liver oil. These things must be used judiciously or they will result\r\nin poisoning or removal of the hair from the animal in some instances.\r\nTen per cent oil of tar in Beaumont oil or in cottonseed oil was found\r\nto be safe and efficacious by Graybill.\r\n\r\nThe use of the fly-maggot trap noted under stomach worms of the horse,\r\nand of the various forms of the Hodge flytrap, is recommended.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLEAS.\r\n\r\nThe flea of man and those of poultry, when numerous, will bite the horse\r\nand give rise to rounded swellings on the skin. To dispose of them it is\r\nneedful to clear the surroundings of the grublike larvae as well as to\r\ntreat the victim. The soil may be sprinkled with quicklime, carbolic\r\nacid, coal tar, or petroleum; the stalls may be deluged with boiling\r\nwater and afterwards painted with oil of turpentine and littered with\r\nfresh pine sawdust, and all blankets should be boiled. The skin may be\r\nsponged with a solution of 1 part carbolic acid in 50 parts of water.\r\nOther animals should be kept free from fleas or kept away from the\r\nvicinity of the stable.\r\n\r\nThe chigoe (_Pulex penetrans_) of the Gulf coast is still more\r\ninjurious, because it burrows under the surface and deposits its eggs to\r\nbe hatched out slowly with much irritation. The tumor formed by it\r\nshould be laid-open and the parasite extracted. If it bursts so that its\r\neggs escape into the wound, they may be destroyed by introducing\r\nchloroform into the wound.\r\n\r\n\r\nLICE, OR PEDICULI.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of lice attack the horse, one of which is furnished with\r\nnarrow head and a proboscis for perforating the skin and sucking the\r\nblood, and the other--the broad-headed kind--with strong mandibles, by\r\nwhich it bites the skin only. The poor condition, itching, and loss of\r\nhair should lead to suspicion, and a close examination will detect the\r\nlice. They may be destroyed by rubbing the victim with sulphur\r\nointment, or with sulphuret of potassium 4 ounces, water 1 gallon, or\r\nwith tar water, or the skin may be sponged with benzine. The application\r\nshould be repeated a week later to destroy all lice hatched from the\r\nnits in the interval. Buildings, clothes, etc., should be treated as for\r\nfleas.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTINGS OF BEES, WASPS, AND HORNETS.\r\n\r\nThese are much more irritating than the bites of flies, partly because\r\nthe barbed sting is left in the wound and partly because of the quantity\r\nand quality of the venom. When a swarm attacks an animal the result may\r\nprove fatal.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ consists in the application of wet clay, or of a lotion of\r\nsoda or ammonia, or of carbolic acid, or permanganate of potash, 2\r\ngrains to the ounce; or of sugar of lead 2 drams, laudanum 1 ounce, and\r\nwater 1 pint. The embedded stings should be extracted with fine forceps\r\nor even with the finger nails.\r\n\r\n\r\nTARANTULA AND SCORPION.\r\n\r\nThe bite of the first and the sting of the second are poisonous, and may\r\nbe treated like other insect venom, by carbolated glycerin, or a strong\r\nsolution of ammonia, or permanganate of potash.\r\n\r\n\r\nSNAKE BITES.\r\n\r\nThese are marked by the double incision caused by the two fangs, by the\r\nexcessive doughy (dark red) swelling around the wounds, and in bad cases\r\nby the general symptoms of giddiness, weakness, and prostration. They\r\nare best treated by enormous doses of alcohol, whisky, or brandy, or by\r\naqua ammonia very largely diluted in water, the object being to sustain\r\nlife until the poison shall have spent its power. As local treatment, if\r\nthe wound is in a limb, the latter may have a handkerchief or cord tied\r\naround it above the injury and drawn tight by a stick twisted into it.\r\nIn this way absorption may be checked until the poison can be destroyed\r\nby the application, of a hot iron or a piece of nitrate of silver or\r\nother caustic. A poultice of tobacco leaves is a favorite remedy, and\r\nmay be used to soothe the sore after cauterization.\r\n\r\nA treatment which has been highly recommended consists in prompt and\r\nvigorous scarification at the site of puncture and rubbing crystals of\r\npotassium permanganate into the wound.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURNS AND SCALDS.\r\n\r\nThese subjects are discussed in the following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDS OF THE SKIN.\r\n\r\nWounds of the skin are fully discussed in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] An outbreak of quittor near Cheyenne, Wyo., which came under the\r\nauthor's observation, was caused by the mud through which the horses had\r\nto wade to reach the watering troughs. These troughs were furnished with\r\nwater by windmills, and the mudholes were caused by the waste water.\r\nMore than 50 cases developed inside of two months, or during September\r\nand October. In these 50 cases all forms of the disease and all possible\r\ncomplications were presented. During the rainy season at Leadville,\r\nColo., outbreaks of quittor are common, and the disease is so virulent\r\nthat it has long been known as the \"Leadville foot rot.\" The soil being\r\nrich in mineral matters is no doubt the cause of the outbreaks. In the\r\ncity of Montreal quittor is said to be very common in the early\r\nspringtime, when the streets are muddy from the melting snow and ice.\r\n\r\n[4] Descazeaux has shown that the worms found in these summer sores are\r\nprobably larval forms of the stomach worms of the horse, _Habronema\r\nmegastoma_, _H. microstoma_, and _H. muscae_. Ransom has shown that the\r\nlarval stage of _H. muscae_ develops in the common housefly, the fly\r\nbecoming infested as a maggot in horse manure. Infestation with the\r\nadult worms in the stomach of the horse (Pl. V, fig. 4) may take place\r\nthrough the ingestion of such infested flies, or by the escape of the\r\nlarva from the proboscis of the fly as it feeds on the moist lips of the\r\nhorse. In view of this it may be surmised that summer sores may arise as\r\nthe result of flies so infested feeding on the moisture on the skin of\r\nthe horse. In some forms of summer sores along the abdomen there are\r\nfound immature stages of _Habronema_ which apparently have just escaped\r\nfrom the egg and which are younger than some of the stages found in the\r\nfly. In this case it is surmised that these embryos from the manure\r\nenter the soiled skin of the horse, as it lies down on dirty bedding and\r\nmanure, and develop in the skin as they would ordinarily in the fly.\r\nDescazeaux calls these summer sores cutaneous habronemiasis.\r\n\r\nPreventive measures consist in the removal of the adult worms from the\r\nstomach of the horse by the use of anthelmintics, the destruction of the\r\nembryos in the manure, fly-control measures, and the use of clean\r\nbedding.--M. C. HALL.\r\n\r\n[5] Descazeaux recommends the application and injection of 2 to 3 per\r\ncent trypanblue, though he states that the only truly efficacious\r\ntreatment is the early and complete ablation of the invaded tissue.--M.\r\nC.

M.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF WOUNDS.\r\n\r\nA wound is an injury to any part of the body involving a solution of\r\ncontinuity or disruption of the affected parts and is caused by\r\nviolence, with or without laceration of the skin. In accordance with\r\nthis definition we have the following varieties of wounds: Incised,\r\npunctured, contused, lacerated, gunshot, and poisoned. They may further\r\nbe classified as superficial, deep, or penetrating, and also as unclean,\r\nif hair, dirt, or splinters of wood are present; as infected when\r\ncontaminated with germs, and as aseptic if the wound does not contain\r\ngerms.\r\n\r\nAn incised wound is a simple cut made with a sharp body, like a knife,\r\nproducing merely a division of the tissues. The duller the body the more\r\nforce is required, the more tissues destroyed, and a greater time will\r\nbe required for healing. In a cut wound the edges are even and definite,\r\nwhile those of a lacerated wound are irregular and torn. Three\r\nconditions are present as a result of an incised wound: (1) Pain, (2)\r\nhemorrhage, (3) gaping of the wound. The first pain is due to the\r\ncrushing and tearing of the nerve fibers. In using a sharp knife and by\r\ncutting quickly, the animal suffers less pain and healing occurs more\r\nrapidly. The secondary pain is usually due to the action of the air and\r\ninflammatory processes. When air is kept from the wound pain ceases soon\r\nafter the lesion is produced. Hemorrhage is absent only in wounds of\r\nnonvascular tissues, as the cornea of the eye, the cartilage of joints,\r\nand other similar structures. Bleeding may be from the arteries, veins,\r\nor capillaries. In the last form of bleeding the blood oozes from the\r\npart in drops. Hemorrhage from the veins is dark red and issues in a\r\nsteady stream without spurting. In arterial bleeding the blood is bright\r\nred and spurts with each heart beat. This latter variety of hemorrhage\r\nis the most dangerous, and should be stopped at once before attempting\r\nany further treatment. Bleeding from small veins and capillaries ceases\r\nin a short time spontaneously, while larger vessels, especially\r\narteries, require some form of treatment to cause complete stoppage of\r\nthe hemorrhage.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEMOSTASIA.\r\n\r\nBy this term is meant the checking of the flow of blood. It may be\r\naccomplished by several methods, such as compress bandages, torsion, hot\r\niron, and ligatures. The heat from a hot iron will cause the immediate\r\nclotting of the blood in the vessels, and this clot is further supported\r\nby the production of a scab, or crust, over the portion seared. The iron\r\nshould be at a red heat. If at a white heat, the tissue is charred,\r\nwhich makes it brittle and the bleeding is liable to be renewed. If the\r\niron is at a black heat, the tissue will stick to the iron and will pull\r\naway from the surface of the wound. Cold water and ice bags quickly stop\r\ncapillary bleeding, while hot water is preferable in more excessive\r\nhemorrhages. Some drugs, called styptics, possess the power of\r\ncontracting the walls of blood vessels and also of clotting the blood. A\r\nsolution of the chlorid of iron placed on a wound alone or by means of\r\ncotton drenched in the liquid produces a rapid and hard clot. Tannic\r\nacid, alum, acetic acid, alcohol, and oil of turpentine are all more or\r\nless active in this respect. To check bleeding from large vessels\r\ncompression may be adopted. When it is rapid and dangerous and from an\r\nartery, the fingers may be used for pressing between the wound and the\r\nheart (digital compression), but if from a vein, the pressure should be\r\nexerted on the other side of the wound. Tourniquet may also be used by\r\npassing a strap around the part and tightening after placing a pad over\r\nthe hemorrhage. The rubber ligature has now replaced the tourniquet and\r\nis bound tightly around the limb to arrest the bleeding. Tampons, such\r\nas cotton, tow, or oakum, may be packed tightly in the wound and then\r\nsewed up. After remaining there for twenty-four or forty-eight hours\r\nthey are removed. Bleeding may sometimes be easily checked by passing a\r\npin under the vessel and by taking a horsehair and forming a figure 8 by\r\nrunning it above and below the pin, thus causing pressure on the vessel.\r\nTorsion is the twisting of the blood vessel until the walls come\r\ntogether and form a barrier to the flow of blood. It may be accomplished\r\nby the fingers, forceps, or by running a pin through the vessel, turning\r\nit several times, and then running the point into the tissue to keep it\r\nin a fixed position.\r\n\r\nLigation is the third method for stopping a hemorrhage. The blood vessel\r\nshould be seized with the artery forceps, a clean thread of silk passed\r\naround it, and tied about one-half inch from its end. The silk should be\r\nsterilized by placing it in an antiseptic solution so as not to impede\r\nthe healing process or cause blood poisoning or lockjaw, which often\r\nfollows the ligation of a vein with unsterilized material. Sometimes it\r\nwill be impossible to reach the bleeding vessel, so it is necessary to\r\npass the ligature around a mass of tissue which includes the blood\r\nvessel. Ligation is the most useful method of arresting hemorrhage,\r\nsince it disturbs healing least and gives the greatest security against\r\nsecondary hemorrhage.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUTURES.\r\n\r\nAfter the bleeding has been controlled and all foreign bodies removed\r\nfrom the wound, the gaping of the wound is noticeable. It is caused by\r\nthe contraction of the muscles and elastic fibers, and its degree\r\ndepends on the extent, direction, and nature of the cut. This gaping\r\nwill hinder the healing process so that it must be overcome by bringing\r\nthe edges together by some sort of sutures or pins or by a bandage\r\napplied from below upward. As suture material, ordinary cotton thread is\r\ngood, if well sterilized, as are also horsehair, catgut, silk, and\r\nvarious kinds of wire. If the suture is made too tight the subsequent\r\nswelling may cause the stitch to tear out. In order to make a firm\r\nsuture the depth of the stitch should be the same as the distance the\r\nstitch is from the edge of the wound. The deeper the suture the more\r\ntissue is embraced and the fewer the number of stitches required. In\r\ntying a suture the square or reef knot should be used. Closure of wounds\r\nby means of adhesive plaster, collodion, and metal clamps is not\r\npracticed to any great extent in veterinary practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCESS OF HEALING.\r\n\r\nIn those cases where perfect stoppage of bleeding, perfect coaptation of\r\nthe edges of the wound, and perfect cleanliness are obtained, healing\r\noccurs within three days, without the formation of granulations, pus, or\r\nproud flesh, by what is termed first intention. If wounds do not heal in\r\nthis manner they will gap somewhat and become warm and painful. Healing\r\nthen occurs by granulation or suppuration, which is termed healing by\r\nsecond intention. The sides of the wound become covered with granulation\r\ntissue which may fill the wound and sometimes overlap the lips, forming\r\na fungoid growth called proud flesh. Under favorable conditions the\r\nedges of the wound appear to grow together by the end of the first week,\r\nand the whole surface gradually becomes dry, and finally covered with\r\npigmented skin, when the wound is healed. The cause of pus formation in\r\nwounds is usually the presence of germs. For this reason the utmost care\r\nshould be adopted to keep clean wounds aseptic, or free from germs, and\r\nto make unclean wounds antiseptic by using antiseptic fluids to kill the\r\nmicrobes present in the wound. The less the injurious action of this\r\nfluid on the wound and the greater its power to kill germs, the more\r\nvaluable it becomes. All antiseptics are not equally destructive, and\r\nsome germs are more susceptible to one antiseptic than to another. The\r\nmost important are (1) bichlorid of mercury, which is to be preferred on\r\nhorses. It becomes weakened in its action if placed in a wooden pail or\r\non an oily or greasy surface. It is used in the strength of 1 part of\r\nbichlorid to 1,000 to 5,000 parts of water, according to the delicacy of\r\nthe tissue to which it is applied. (2) Carbolic acid in from 2 to 5 per\r\ncent solution is used on infected wounds and for cleaning instruments,\r\ndressings, and sponges. It unites well with oil and is preferred to the\r\nbichlorid on a greasy surface. A 5 per cent solution in oil is often\r\nused under the name of carbolized oil. (3) Aluminum acetate is an\r\nefficient and cheap antiseptic, and is composed of 1 part alum and 5\r\nparts acetate of lead, mixed in 20 parts of water. (4) Boric acid is\r\ngood, in a 2 to 4 per cent solution, to cleanse wounds and wash eyes.\r\nCompound cresol may be used in a 1 to 3 per cent solution in water.\r\nIodoform is one of the most used of the antiseptics, and it also acts as\r\nan anodyne, stimulates granulation, and checks wound secretion. A very\r\nefficacious and inexpensive powder is made by taking 5 parts of iodoform\r\nand 95 parts of sugar, making what is called iodoform sugar. Tannic acid\r\nis a useful drug in the treatment of wounds, as it arrests hemorrhage,\r\nchecks secretion, and favors the formation of a scab. A mixture of 1\r\npart tannic acid and 3 parts iodoform is good in suppurating wounds.\r\nIodol, white sugar, ground and roasted coffee, and powdered charcoal are\r\nall used as protectives and absorbents on suppurating surfaces. More\r\ndepends on the care and the method of application of the drug than on\r\nthe drug itself. On aseptic wounds use only those antiseptics that do\r\nnot irritate the tissue. If care is used in the application of the\r\nantiseptic, corrosive sublimate or carbolic acid is to be recommended.\r\nIn order to keep air from the wound and to absorb all wound secretions\r\nrapidly, a dressing should be applied. If the wound is aseptic, the\r\ndressing should be likewise, such as cotton gauze, sterile cotton,\r\noakum, or tow. This dressing should be applied with uniform pressure at\r\nall times and secured by a bandage. Allow it to remain for a week or ten\r\ndays if the wound is aseptic or if the dressing does not become loose or\r\nmisplaced or become drenched with secretions from the wound, or if pain,\r\nfever, or loss of appetite does not develop. The dressing should then be\r\nremoved, the wound treated antiseptically, and a sterilized dressing\r\napplied.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEALING UNDER A SCAB.\r\n\r\nThis often occurs in small superficial wounds that have been kept\r\naseptic. In order that a scab may form, the wound must not gap, secrete\r\nfreely, or become infected with germs. The formation of scab is favored\r\nby astringents and styptics, such as tannic acid, iodoform, and 5 per\r\ncent solution of zinc chlorid. In case of fistulous withers, open\r\njoints, or other large, hollow wounds that can not be dressed,\r\nantisepsis may be obtained by warm-water irrigation with or without an\r\nantiseptic fluid. It should continue day and night, and never be\r\ninterrupted for more than eight hours, for germs will then have gained\r\nheadway and will be difficult to remove. Four or five days of irrigation\r\nwill be sufficient, for granulations will then have formed and pus will\r\nremain on the outside if it forms. For permanent irrigation the stream\r\nshould be very small, or drop by drop, but should play over the entire\r\nsurface of the wound. It is always better to heal an infected wound\r\nunder a scab, or treat it as an open wound, than it is to suture it,\r\nthus favoring the growth of the inclosed germs and retarding ultimate\r\nhealing. In the latter case pus may develop in the wound, form pockets\r\nby sinking into the tissues, and cause various complications. The\r\npockets should be well drained, either through incisions at the bottom\r\nor by drainage tubes or setons. They should then be frequently syringed\r\nout or continuously irrigated. In case proud flesh appears it should be\r\nkept down either by pressure or by caustics, as powdered bluestone,\r\nsilver nitrate, chlorid of antimony, or by astringents, such as burnt\r\nalum. If they prove resistant to this treatment they may be removed by\r\nscissors, the knife, or by searing with the hot iron. The following\r\nrules for the treatment of wounds should be followed: (1) See that the\r\nwound is clean, removing all foreign bodies. (2) For this purpose use a\r\nclean finger rather than a probe. (3) All hemorrhage should be arrested\r\nbefore closing the wound. (4) Antiseptics should only be used if you\r\nsuspect the wound to be infected. (5) When pus is present treat without\r\nclosing the wound. (6) This may be accomplished by drainage tubes,\r\nabsorbent dressings, setons, or continuous irrigations. (7) Protect the\r\nwound against infection while healing.\r\n\r\n\r\nLACERATED AND CONTUSED WOUNDS.\r\n\r\nLacerated and contused wounds may be described together although there\r\nis, of course, this difference, that in contused wounds there is no\r\nbreak or laceration of the skin. Lacerated wounds, however, are, as a\r\nrule, also contused--the surrounding tissues are bruised to a greater or\r\nlesser extent. While at first sight such wounds may not appear to be as\r\nserious as incised wounds, they are commonly very much more so.\r\nLacerations and contusions, when extensive, are always to be regarded as\r\ndangerous. Many horses die from septic infection or mortification as a\r\nresult of these injuries. We find in severe contusions an infiltration\r\nof blood into the surrounding tissues: disorganization and mortification\r\nfollow, and involve often the deeper seated structures. Abscesses,\r\nsingle or multiple, may also result and call for special treatment.\r\n\r\nIn wounds that are lacerated the amount of hemorrhage is mostly\r\ninconsiderable; even very large blood vessels may be torn apart without\r\ninducing a fatal result. The edges of the wound are ragged and uneven.\r\nThese wounds are produced by barbed wire or some blunt object, as when a\r\nhorse runs against fences, board piles, the corners of buildings, or\r\nwhen he is struck by the pole or shafts of another team, falling on\r\nrough, irregular stones, etc.\r\n\r\nContused wounds are caused by blunt instruments moving with sufficient\r\nvelocity to bruise and crush the tissues, as kicks, running against\r\nobjects, or falling on large, hard masses.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In lacerated wounds great care must at first be exercised\r\nin examining or probing to the very bottom of the rent or tear, to see\r\nwhether any foreign body is present. Very often splinters of wood or\r\nbits of stone or dirt are thus lodged, and unless removed prevent the\r\nwound from healing; or if it should heal, the wound soon opens again,\r\ndischarging a thin, gluey matter that is characteristic of the presence\r\nof some object in the part. After a thorough exploration these wounds\r\nare to be carefully and patiently fomented with warm water, to which has\r\nbeen added carbolic acid in the proportion of 1 part to 100 of water.\r\nRarely, if ever, are stitches to be inserted in lacerated wounds. The\r\nsurrounding tissues and skin are so weakened in vitality and structure\r\nby the contusions that stitches will not hold; they only irritate the\r\nparts. It is better to endeavor to obtain coaptation by means of\r\nbandages, plasters, or collodion. One essential in the treatment of\r\nlacerated wounds is to provide a free exit for the pus. If the orifice\r\nof the wound is too high, or if pus is found to be burrowing in the\r\ntissues beneath the opening, we must then make a counter opening as low\r\nas possible. This will admit of the wound being thoroughly washed out,\r\nat first with warm water, and afterwards injected with some mild\r\nastringent and antiseptic wash, as chlorid of zinc, 1 dram to a pint of\r\nwater. A dependent opening must be maintained until the wound ceases to\r\ndischarge. Repeated hot fomentations over the region of lacerated wounds\r\nafford much relief and should be persisted in.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUISES.\r\n\r\nBruises are nothing but contused wounds where the skin has not been\r\nruptured. There is often considerable solution of continuity of the\r\nparts under the skin, subcutaneous hemorrhage, etc., which may result in\r\nlocal death (mortification) and slough of the bruised parts. If the\r\nbruise or contusion is not so severe, many cases are quickly cured by\r\nconstant fomentation with hot water for from two to four hours. The\r\nwater should be allowed about this time to become cool gradually and\r\nthen cold. Cold fomentation must then be kept up for another hour or\r\ntwo. The parts should be thoroughly and quickly dried and bathed freely\r\nwith camphor 1 ounce, sweet oil 8 ounces, or with equal parts of lead\r\nwater and laudanum. A dry, light bandage should then be applied, the\r\nhorse allowed to rest, and if necessary the treatment may be repeated\r\neach day for two or three days. If, however, the wound is so severe that\r\nsloughing must ensue, we should encourage it by poultices made of\r\nlinseed meal, wheat bran, turnips, onions, bread and milk, or hops.\r\nCharcoal is to be sprinkled over the surface of the poultice when the\r\nwound is bad smelling. After the slough has fallen off the wound is to\r\nbe dressed with warm washes of carbolic acid, chlorid of zinc,\r\npermanganate of potash, or other antiseptic. If granulating (filling up)\r\ntoo fast, use burnt alum or air-slaked lime. Besides this local\r\ntreatment, we find that the constitutional symptoms of fever and\r\ninflammation call for measures to prevent or control them. This is best\r\ndone by placing the injured animal on soft or green feed. A physic of\r\nBarbados aloes, 1 ounce, should be given as soon as possible after the\r\naccident. Sedatives, such as tincture of aconite root, 15 drops, three\r\ntimes a day, or ounce doses of saltpeter every four hours, may also be\r\nadministered. When the symptoms of fever are abated, and if the\r\ndischarges from the wound are abundant, the strength of the patient must\r\nbe supported by good feed and tonics. One of the best tonics is as\r\nfollows: Powdered sulphate of iron, powdered gentian, and powdered\r\nginger, of each 4 ounces. Mix thoroughly and give a heaping\r\ntablespoonful twice a day, on the feed or as a drench.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUNCTURED WOUNDS.\r\n\r\nPunctured wounds are produced by the penetration of a sharp or\r\nblunt-pointed substance, such as a thorn, fork, nail, etc., and the\r\norifice of these wounds is always small in proportion to their depth. In\r\nveterinary practice punctured wounds are much more common than the\r\nothers. They involve the feet most frequently, next the legs, and often\r\nthe head and face from nails protruding through the stalls and trough.\r\nThey are not only the most frequent, but they are also the most serious,\r\nowing to the difficulty of obtaining thorough disinfection. Another\r\ncircumstance rendering them so is the lack of attention that they at\r\nfirst receive. The external wound is so small that but little or no\r\nimportance is attached to it, yet in a short time swelling, pain, and\r\nacute inflammation, often of a serious character, are manifested.\r\n\r\nConsidering the most common of the punctured wounds, we must give\r\nprecedence to those of the feet. Horses worked in cities, about iron\r\nworks, around building places, etc., are most likely to receive \"nails\r\nin the feet.\" The animal treads upon nails, pieces of iron or screws,\r\nforcing them into the soles of the feet. If the nail, or whatever it is\r\nthat has punctured the foot, is fast in some large or heavy body, and is\r\nwithdrawn as the horse lifts his foot, lameness may last for only a few\r\nsteps; but unless properly attended to at once he will be found in a\r\nday or two to be very lame in the injured member. If the foreign body\r\nremains in the foot, he gradually grows worse from the time of puncture\r\nuntil the cause is discovered and removed. If, when shoeing, a nail is\r\ndriven into the \"quick\" (sensitive laminae) and allowed to remain, the\r\nhorse gradually evinces more pain from day to day; but if the nail has\r\nat once been removed by the smith, lameness does not, as a rule, show\r\nitself for some days; or, if the nail is simply driven \"too close,\" not\r\nactually pricking the horse, he may not show any lameness for a week or\r\neven much longer. At this point it is due to the blacksmith to say that,\r\nconsidering how thin the walls of some feet are, the uneasiness of many\r\nhorses while shoeing, the ease with which a nail is diverted from its\r\ncourse by striking an old piece of nail left in the wall, or from the\r\nnail itself splitting, the wonder is not that so many horses are pricked\r\nor nails driven \"too close,\" but rather that many more are not so\r\ninjured. It is not, by any means, always carelessness or ignorance on\r\nthe part of the smith that is to account for this accident. Bad and\r\ncareless shoers we do meet with, but let us be honest and say that the\r\nrarity of these accidents points rather to the general care and\r\nattention given by these much-abused mechanics.\r\n\r\nFrom the construction of the horse's foot (being incased in an\r\nimpermeable, horny box), and from the elasticity of the horn closing the\r\norifice, punctured wounds of the feet are almost always productive of\r\nlameness. Inflammation results, and as there is no relief afforded by\r\nswelling and no escape for the product of inflammation, this matter must\r\nand does burrow between the sole or wall and the sensitive parts within\r\nit until it generally opens \"between hair and hoof.\" We can thus see why\r\npain is so much more severe, why tetanus (lockjaw) more frequently\r\nfollows wounds of the feet, and why, from the extensive, or at times\r\ncomplete, separation and \"casting\" of the hoof, these wounds must always\r\nbe regarded with grave apprehension.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms and treatment._--A practice which, if never deviated\r\nfrom--that of picking up each foot, cleaning the sole, and thoroughly\r\nexamining the foot each and every time the horse comes into the\r\nstable--will enable us to reduce to the minimum the serious consequences\r\nof punctured wounds of the feet. If the wound has resulted from\r\npricking, lameness follows soon after shoeing; if from the nails being\r\ndriven too close, it usually appears from four to five days or a week\r\nafterwards. We should always inquire as to the time of shoeing, examine\r\nthe shoe carefully, and see whether it has been partially pulled and the\r\nhorse has stepped back upon some of the nails or the clip. The pain from\r\nthese wounds is lancinating; the horse is seen to raise and lower the\r\nlimb or hold it from the ground altogether; often he points the foot,\r\nflexes the leg, and knuckles at the fetlock. Swelling of the fetlock\r\nand back tendons is also frequently seen and is liable to mislead us.\r\nThe foot must be carefully examined, and this can not be properly done\r\nwithout removing the shoe. The nails should be drawn separately and\r\ncarefully examined. If there is no escape of pus from the nail holes, or\r\nif the nails themselves are not moist, we must continue our examination\r\nof the foot by carefully pinching or tapping it at all parts. With a\r\nlittle practice we can detect the spot where pain is the greatest or\r\ndiscover the delicate line or scar left at the point of entrance of the\r\nforeign body. The entire sole is then to be thinned, after which we are\r\ncarefully to cut down upon the point where pain is greatest upon\r\npressure, and, finally, through the sole at this spot. When the matter\r\nhas escaped, the sole, so far as it was undermined by pus, is to be\r\nremoved. The foot must now be poulticed for one or two days and\r\nafterwards dressed with a compress of oakum saturated with carbolic-acid\r\nsolution or other antiseptic dressing.\r\n\r\nIf we discover a nail or other object in the foot, the principal\r\ndirection, after having removed the offending body, is to cut away the\r\nsole, in a funnel shape, down to the sensitive parts beneath. This is\r\nimperative, and if a good free opening has been made and is maintained\r\nfor a few days, and hot fomentations and antiseptic dressings applied,\r\nthe cure is mostly easy, simple, quick, and permanent. The horse should\r\nbe shod with a leather sole under the shoe, first of all applying tar\r\nand oakum to prevent any dirt from entering the wound. In some instances\r\nnails may puncture the flexor tendons, the coffin bone, or enter the\r\ncoffin joint. Such injuries are always serious, their recovery slow and\r\ntedious, and the treatment so varied and difficult that the services of\r\na veterinarian will be necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUNCTURED WOUNDS OF JOINTS, OR OPEN JOINTS.\r\n\r\nThese wounds are more or less frequent. They are always serious, and\r\noften result in anchylosis (stiffening) of the joint or the death of the\r\nanimal. The joints mostly punctured are the hock, fetlock, or knee,\r\nthough other joints may, of course, suffer this injury. As the symptoms\r\nand treatment are much the same for all, only the accident as it occurs\r\nin the hock joint will be described. Probably the most common mode of\r\ninjury is from the stab of a fork, but it may result from the kick of\r\nanother horse that is newly shod, or in many other ways. At first the\r\nhorse evinces but slight pain or lameness. The owner discovers a small\r\nwound scarcely larger than a pea, and pays but little attention to it.\r\nIn a few days, however, the pain and lameness become excessive; the\r\nhorse can no longer bear any weight upon the injured leg; the joint is\r\nvery much swollen and painful upon pressure; there are well-marked\r\nsymptoms of constitutional disturbance--quick pulse, hurried breathing,\r\nhigh temperature, 103 deg. to 106 deg. F., the appetite is lost, thirst is\r\npresent, the horse reeks with sweat, and his anxious countenance shows\r\nthe pain he suffers. He may lie down, though mostly he persists in\r\nstanding, and the opposite limb becomes greatly swollen from bearing the\r\nentire weight and strain for so long a time. The wound, which at first\r\nappeared so insignificant, is now constantly discharging a thin, whitish\r\nor yellowish fluid--joint oil or water, which becomes coagulated about\r\nthe mouth of the wound and adheres to the part in clots like jelly, or\r\nresembling somewhat the white of an egg. Not infrequently the joint\r\nopens at different places, discharging at first a thin, bloody fluid\r\nthat soon assumes the character above described.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ of these wounds is most difficult and unsatisfactory. We can\r\ndo much to prevent this array of symptoms if the case is seen\r\nearly--within the first 24 or 48 hours after the injury; but when\r\ninflammation of the joint is once fairly established the case becomes\r\none of grave tendencies. Whenever a punctured wound of a joint is\r\nnoticed, even though apparently of but small moment, we should apply\r\nwithout the least delay a strong cantharides blister over the entire\r\njoint, being even careful to fill the orifice of the wound with the\r\nblistering ointment. This treatment is almost always effectual. It\r\noperates to perform a cure in two ways--first, the swelling of the skin\r\nand tissues underneath it completely closes the wound and prevents the\r\ningress of air; second, by the superficial inflammation established it\r\nacts to check and abate all deep-seated inflammation. In the great\r\nmajority of instances, if pursued soon after the accident, this\r\ntreatment performs a cure in about one week; but should the changes\r\ndescribed as occurring later in the joint have already taken place, we\r\nmust then treat by cooling lotions and the application to the wound of\r\nchlorid of zinc, 10 grains to the ounce of water, or a paste made of\r\nflour and alum. A bandage is to hold these applications in place, which\r\nis only to be removed when swelling of the leg or increasing febrile\r\nsymptoms demand it. In the treatment of open joints our chief aim must\r\nbe to close the orifice as soon as possible. For this reason repeated\r\nprobing or even injections are contraindicated. The only probing of an\r\nopen joint that is to be sanctioned is on our first visit, when we\r\nshould carefully examine the wound for foreign bodies or dirt, and after\r\nremoving them the probe must not again be used. The medicines used to\r\ncoagulate the synovial discharge are best simply applied to the surface\r\nof the wound, on pledgets of tow, and held in place by bandages.\r\nInternal treatment is also indicated in those cases of open joints in\r\nwhich the suffering is great. At first we should administer a light\r\nphysic and follow this up with sedatives and anodynes, as directed for\r\ncontused wounds. Later, however, we should give quinin or salicylic acid\r\nin 1-dram doses two or three times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDS OF THE TENDON SHEATHS.\r\n\r\nWounds of tendon sheaths are similar to open joints in that there is an\r\nescape of synovial fluid, \"sinew water.\" Where the tendons are simply\r\npunctured by a thorn, nail, or fork, we must, after a thorough\r\nexploration of the wound for any remaining foreign substance, treat with\r\nthe flour-and-alum paste, bandages, etc., as for open joint. Should the\r\nskin and tendons be divided the case is even more serious and is often\r\nincurable. There is always a large bed of granulations (proud flesh) at\r\nthe seat of injury, and a thickening more or less pronounced remains.\r\nWhen the back tendons of the leg are severed we should apply at once a\r\nhigh-heel shoe (which is to be gradually lowered as healing advances)\r\nand bandage firmly with a compress moistened with a 10-grain chlorid of\r\nzinc solution. When proud flesh appears it is best kept under control by\r\nrepeated applications of a red-hot iron. Mares that are valuable as\r\nbrood animals and stock horses should always be treated for this injury,\r\nas, even though blemished, their value is not seriously impaired. If the\r\nsubject is old and comparatively valueless, the length of time required\r\nand the expense of treatment will cause us to hesitate in attempting a\r\ncure.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUNSHOT WOUNDS.\r\n\r\nThese wounds vary in size and character, depending on the size and\r\nquality of the projectile and also the tissue injured. They are so\r\nseldom met with in our animals that an extended reference to them seems\r\nunnecessary. If a wound has been made by a bullet a careful examination\r\nshould be made to ascertain whether the ball has passed through or out\r\nof the body. If it has not we must then probe for it, and if it can be\r\nlocated it is to be cut out when practicable to do so. Oftentimes a ball\r\nmay be so lodged that it can not be removed, and it then may become\r\nencysted and remain for years without giving rise to any inconvenience.\r\nIt is often difficult to locate a bullet, as it is very readily\r\ndeflected by resistances met with after entering the body.\r\n\r\nThe entering wound is the size of the projectile, the edges are inverted\r\nand often scorched. The wound produced in case of the bullet's exit is\r\nlarger than the projectile, the edges are turned out and ragged. A\r\nbullet heated by the friction of the barrel or air often softens and\r\nbecomes flattened on striking a bone or other tissue. Modern bullets\r\nthat have an outer steel layer may pass through bone without splintering\r\nit. Lead bullets may split, producing two exit wounds. Spent bullets may\r\nonly produce a bruise. Should bones be struck by a ball they are\r\nsometimes shattered and splintered to such an extent as to warrant us in\r\nhaving the animal destroyed. A gunshot wound, when irreparable injury\r\nhas not been done, is to be treated the same as punctured wounds, i.\r\ne., stop the hemorrhage, remove the foreign body if possible, and apply\r\nhot fomentations or poultices to the wound until suppuration is fairly\r\nestablished. Anti-septic and disinfectant injections may then be used.\r\nShould pus accumulate in the tissues, openings must be made at the most\r\ndepending parts for its escape. Wounds from shotguns fired close to the\r\nanimals are serious. They are virtually lacerated and contused wounds.\r\nRemove all the shot possible from the wound and treat as directed for\r\ncontusions. When small shot strike the horse from a distance they stick\r\nin the skin or only go through it. The shot grains must be picked out,\r\nbut as a rule this \"peppering\" of the skin amounts to but little.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOISONED WOUNDS.\r\n\r\nThese injuries are the result of bites of snakes, rabid dogs, stings of\r\nbees, wasps, etc. A single sting is not dangerous, but an animal is\r\noften stung by a swarm of insects, when the chief danger occurs from the\r\nswelling produced. If stung about the head, the nostrils may be closed\r\nas a result of the swelling, causing labored breathing and possibly\r\nasphyxiation. Intoxication may be produced by the absorption of this\r\npoison and is manifested by staggering gait, spreading of the legs,\r\nparalysis of the muscles, difficult respiration, and a rise of\r\ntemperature. Death may follow in five to ten hours.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Douse animal with cold water and apply any alkaline\r\nliquid, such as soapsuds, bicarbonate of soda, or weak solution of\r\nammonia. Internally give alcohol, ether, or camphor to strengthen the\r\nheart. In case of bites by rattlesnakes, moccasin, or other poisonous\r\nsnakes, a painful swelling occurs about the bitten part, which is\r\nfollowed by labored breathing, weakness, retching, fever, and death from\r\ncollapse. The animal usually recovers if it can be kept alive over the\r\nthird day. In treating the animal, a tight ligature should be passed\r\nabout the part above the wound to keep the poison from entering the\r\ngeneral circulation. Wash out the wound thoroughly with antiseptics and\r\nthen apply a caustic, such as silver nitrate, or burn with a hot\r\ninstrument. A subcutaneous injection of one-fourth dram of 1 per cent\r\nsolution of chromic acid above the wound is also beneficial. Cold water\r\nmay be applied to the wound to combat the inflammation. Bites of rabid\r\ndogs produce an infected wound, and the virus of rabies introduced in\r\nthis manner should be removed or destroyed in the wound. Therefore\r\nproduce considerable bleeding by incising the wound, wash out thoroughly\r\nwith 10 per cent solution of zinc chlorid, and then apply caustics or\r\nthe actual cautery.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARNESS GALLS (SITFASTS).\r\n\r\nWounds or abrasions of the skin are frequently caused by ill-fitting\r\nharness or saddles. When a horse has been resting from steady work for\r\nsome time, particularly after being idle in a stable on a scanty\r\nallowance of grain, as in winter, he is soft and tender and sweats\r\neasily when put to work again. In this condition he is liable to sweat\r\nand chafe under the harness, especially if it is hard and poorly fitted.\r\nThis chafing is likely to cause abrasions of the skin, and thus pave the\r\nway for an abscess or for a chronic blemish, unless attended to very\r\npromptly. Besides causing the animal considerable pain, chafing, if long\r\ncontinued, leads to the formation of a callosity. This may be\r\nsuperficial, involving only the skin, or it may be deep-seated,\r\ninvolving the subcutaneous fibrous tissue and sometimes the muscle and\r\neven the bone. This causes a dry slough to form, which is both\r\ninconvenient and unsightly. Sloughs of this kind are commonly called\r\n\"sitfasts\" and, while they occur in other places, are most frequently\r\nfound under the saddle. (See also p. 475.)\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Abrasions are best prevented by bringing the animal\r\ngradually into working shape after it has had a prolonged rest, in order\r\nthat the muscles may be hard and the skin tough. The harness should be\r\nwell fitted, neither too large nor too small, and it should be cleaned\r\nand oiled to remove all dirt and to make it soft and pliable. Saddles\r\nshould be properly fitted so as to prevent direct pressure on the spine,\r\nand the saddle blankets should be clean and dry. Parts of the horse\r\nwhere chafing is likely to occur, as on the back under the saddle,\r\nshould be cleaned and brushed free of dirt.\r\n\r\nThe remedies for simple harness galls are numerous. Among them may be\r\nmentioned alcohol, 1 pint, in which are well shaken the whites of two\r\neggs; a solution of nitrate of silver, 10 grains to the ounce of water;\r\nsugar of lead or sulphate of zinc, 20 grains to an ounce of water;\r\ncarbolic acid, 1 part in 15 parts of glycerin, and so on almost without\r\nend. Any simple astringent wash or powder will effect a cure, provided\r\nthe sores are not irritated by friction.\r\n\r\nIf a sitfast has developed, the dead hornlike slough must be carefully\r\ndissected out and the wound treated carefully with antiseptics. During\r\ntreatment it is always best to allow the animal to rest, but if this is\r\ninconvenient care should be taken to prevent injury to the abraded or\r\nwounded surface by padding the harness so that chafing can not occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURNS AND SCALDS.\r\n\r\nThese wounds of domestic animals are fortunately of rare occurrence;\r\nhowever, when they do occur, if at all extensive, they prove to be quite\r\ntroublesome and in many cases are fatal. According to the severity of\r\nthe burn we distinguish three degrees: First degree, where there is a\r\nsimple reddening of the skin; second degree, where there is a formation\r\nof vesicles, or blisters; third degree, where there is a complete\r\ndestruction of vitality of the tissues, such as would occur in charring\r\nfrom direct contact with flames or from escaping steam. Besides the\r\nburns caused by flames and steam, there are other causative agents, such\r\nas chemicals (caustic alkalis and acids), lightning stroke, and\r\noccasionally the broken trolley wires of electric railways. When a large\r\nsurface of the skin is burned or scalded, the animal (if it does not die\r\nat once from shock) will soon show signs of fever--shivering, coldness\r\nof the extremities, weakness, restlessness, quick and feeble pulse, and\r\nlabored breathing. No matter which agent is a factor in the production\r\nof burns, the lesions are practically of the same nature. The extent and\r\nsite of the burn should lead one in the determination and course of\r\ntreatment. Burns of the shoulder and those about the region of the elbow\r\nor other parts where there is much movement of the tissues are grave,\r\nand, if at all extensive, treatment should not be attempted, but the\r\nimmediate destruction of the animal is advised. A burn of the third\r\ndegree, where there is a destruction of the vitality of large areas of\r\ntissue, even on parts not subject to much motion, is extremely tedious\r\nto treat; in fact, it is questionable whether the treatment and keep of\r\nthe animal will ever be compensated for, even though recovery does take\r\nplace; this, in any event, will require at least six or eight weeks.\r\nBurns caused by lightning stroke and trolley wires are liable to occur\r\nin irregular lines, and, unless death occurs at once, they generally are\r\nnot serious.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment should be prompt and effective. If the burns are\r\nextensive, the constitutional symptoms should be combated with whisky\r\nand milk and eggs, or ammonia carbonate, strychnin, caffein, or other\r\nstimulant to prevent shock. In the local treatment, to alleviate the\r\npain, the application of cold water in some form and the hypodermic\r\ninjection of morphine are to be recommended. In burns of the first\r\ndegree, where there is only a superficial inflammation, lead carbonate\r\n(white lead) ointment is very good. Carron oil (limewater and linseed\r\noil, equal parts) is a standard remedy, but a modification of it known\r\nas Stahl's liniment is perhaps better. This is composed of linseed oil\r\nand limewater each 200 parts, bicarbonate of soda 100 parts, and thymol\r\n1 part. The scorched surface should be covered with this liniment and\r\nthen with a layer of borated gauze or absorbent cotton, to protect from\r\nthe air. The application should be frequently renewed. Carbolated\r\nvaseline may be used in place of the above. In case the burn is more\r\nextensive, the following solution may be used: Picric acid 2 parts,\r\nalcohol 40 parts, water 400 parts. The lesion should be thoroughly\r\ncleansed with this solution used on absorbent cotton. The vesicles, if\r\nany appear, should be opened with a clean needle, allowing the skin to\r\nremain. Strips of gauze or absorbent cotton saturated with the solution\r\nshould now be applied and renewed only occasionally. In burns of the\r\nsecond and third degrees more satisfactory results may be obtained with\r\nnonpoisonous, dry dressing powder, such as is used in ordinary open\r\nwounds, as tannic acid 8 parts and iodoform 1 part, or a salve made of\r\nthis powder and a sufficient quantity of vaseline. When sloughing of the\r\ntissues takes place the wounds should be cleansed with a warm 3 per cent\r\nsolution of carbolic acid, all loose fragments of tissue removed, and\r\neither a dry, antiseptic dressing powder or carbolated vaseline ointment\r\napplied to exclude the air. Granulation tissue (proud flesh) should be\r\ncontrolled by the application of silver nitrate in the form of a caustic\r\npencil.\r\n\r\nBurns due to mineral acids may be first treated by flushing the parts\r\nwith a copious quantity of cold water or by the application of whiting\r\nor chalk. Either use a large quantity of water at the start or use the\r\nchalk first, then wash with water. If the irritant has been a caustic\r\nalkali, such as potash, lye, ammonia, or soda, then vinegar should be\r\nthe first application. Stahl's liniment is probably the best general\r\napplication for all burns for the first week; then this should be\r\nfollowed by the ordinary antiseptic wound dressings.\r\n\r\n\r\nGANGRENE.\r\n\r\nGangrene, or mortification, denotes the death of the affected part, and\r\nis mostly found attacking soft tissue near the surface of the body.\r\nGangrenous areas may occur as a result of shutting off their blood\r\nsupply. Constitutional diseases, such as ergotism, anthrax, and\r\nsepticemia, predispose to gangrene. As external causes we have acids and\r\nalkalies, freezing and burning, contusions and continuous pressure that\r\ninterrupt the circulation. There are two forms of gangrene--dry and\r\nmoist. Dry gangrene is most often seen in horses from continuous lying\r\ndown (decubitus) or from uneven pressure of some portion of the harness.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--There is a lack of sensation due to the death of nerves. In\r\ndry gangrene the skin is leathery and harsh, while in moist gangrene the\r\ntissues are soft, wrinkled, and friable; the hair is disturbed, and the\r\nskin is usually moist and soapy and sometimes covered with blebs. The\r\ntissue surrounding the moist gangrenous patch is usually inflamed,\r\nswollen, and hot, but this is less noticeable in the case of dry\r\ngangrene. Moist gangrene often spreads and involves deeper tissue,\r\nsheaths of tendons and joints producing septic synovitis or septic\r\narthritis leading to pyemia and death. Dry gangrene is seldom dangerous,\r\nbut the rapidity of its spread will indicate its virulence.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The preventive treatment consists in avoiding all the\r\ninfluences that tend to disturb the nutrition of the tissues, such as\r\nexcessive cold or heat or continuous pressure. Gangrene following\r\ndecubitus may be prevented by using soft bedding and frequently turning\r\nthe animal from one side to the other. In dry gangrene moist heat in the\r\nform of poultices or anointing the tissue with oils and fats will be\r\nfound beneficial in hastening the dead tissue to slough off. When the\r\nouter skin begins to suppurate, it should be removed with a pair of\r\npincers, and the patch treated as an open wound. In moist gangrene the\r\ntissue should be thoroughly disinfected with a 3 per cent solution of\r\ncompound cresol, or particularly an alcoholic tincture of camphor.\r\nContinuous irritation with antiseptic fluids prevents the accumulation\r\nand absorption of poisonous liquids. Incisions into the dead tissue may\r\nbe made, and when sloughing commences the tissue should be removed with\r\nforceps and the resulting wound treated as in dry gangrene.\r\n\r\n\r\nULCERATION.\r\n\r\nAn ulcer is a circumscribed area of necrosis occurring on the skin or\r\nmucous membrane and covered with granulation tissue. It is a process of\r\ndestruction, and when this process is going on faster than regeneration\r\ncan take place, we have a gnawing, or eating, ulcer. When such an ulcer\r\nincreases rapidly in size it is termed a phagedenic ulcer. A fungoid\r\nulcer is one in which the bottom of the ulcer projects beyond the edge\r\nof the skin. These ulcers secrete milky or bloody-white liquid called\r\nichor. When the ulcer is of an ashen or leaden color, with the bottom\r\nand sides formed of dense, hard connective tissue, which gives but\r\nlittle discharge and is not sensitive, it is termed callous, torpid, or\r\nindolent ulcer.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--As in the case of gangrene, disturbances of circulation are\r\namong the most frequent causes. A wound to a tissue with slight\r\nrecuperative power may be followed by ulceration, as in tumors. Certain\r\ngerms may produce ulcers, as the glanders bacilli, which cause the\r\nulcerations on the nasal septum in glanders.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--This consists in removing the exciting cause at once. The\r\nsecretions of the ulcer should be washed off with antiseptic solutions\r\nand the formation of granulation tissues stimulated by antiseptic\r\nsalves, such as carbolated vaseline, lead ointment, or by dressings of\r\ncamphor. Air should be kept from the ulcer by occlusive dressings. Where\r\nthe ulcers are inflamed, warm lead water or lead water and laudanum will\r\nbe found efficacious. Callous ulcers are best removed by a curette,\r\nknife, or hot iron and then treated like a common wound. Mechanical\r\nirritation should be avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\nABSCESSES.\r\n\r\nThese consist of accumulations of pus within circumscribed walls, at\r\ndifferent parts of the body, and may be classed as acute and cold or\r\nchronic abscesses.\r\n\r\nWhen an abscess occurs about a hair follicle it is called a boil or\r\nfuruncle; when several hair follicles are involved, resulting in the\r\nformation of more than one exit for the inflammatory products, it is\r\ncalled a carbuncle.\r\n\r\n\r\nACUTE ABSCESSES.\r\n\r\nAcute abscesses follow as the result of local inflammation in glands,\r\nmuscular tissue, or even bones. They are very common in the two former.\r\nThe abscesses most commonly met with in the horse (and the ones which\r\nwill be here described) are those of the salivary glands, occurring\r\nduring the existence of \"strangles,\" or \"colt distemper.\" The glands\r\nbehind or under the jaw are seen to increase slowly in size, becoming\r\nfirm, hard, hot, and painful. At first the swelling is uniformly hard\r\nand resisting over its entire surface, but in a little while becomes\r\nsoft (fluctuating) at some portion, mostly in the center. From this time\r\non the abscess is said to be \"pointing,\" or \"coming to a head,\" which is\r\nshown by a small elevated or projecting prominence, which at first is\r\ndry, but soon becomes moist with transuded serum. The hairs over this\r\npart loosen and fall off, and in a short time the abscess opens, the\r\ncontents escape, and the cavity gradually fills up--heals by\r\ngranulations.\r\n\r\nAbscesses in muscular tissue are usually the result of bruises or\r\ninjuries. In all cases in which abscesses are forming we should hurry\r\nthe ripening process by frequent hot fomentations and poultices. When\r\nthey are very tardy in their development a blister over their surface is\r\nadvisable. It is a common rule with surgeons to open an abscess as soon\r\nas pus can be plainly felt, but this practice can scarcely be\r\nrecommended indiscriminately to owners of stock, since this little\r\noperation frequently requires an exact knowledge of anatomy. It will\r\nusually be found the better plan to encourage the full ripening of an\r\nabscess and allow it to open of itself. This is imperative if the\r\nabscess is in the region of joints, etc. When open, we must not squeeze\r\nthe walls of the abscess to any extent. They may be very gently pressed\r\nwith the fingers at first to remove the clots--inspissated pus--but\r\nafter this the orifice is simply to be kept open by the introduction of\r\na clean probe, should it be disposed to heal too soon. If the opening is\r\nat too high a level another should be made into the lowest portion of\r\nthe abscess so as to permit the most complete drainage. Hot fomentations\r\nor poultices are sometimes required for a day or two after an abscess\r\nhas opened, and are particularly indicated when the base of the abscess\r\nis hard and indurated.\r\n\r\nThe cavity should be thoroughly washed with stimulating antiseptic\r\nsolutions, such as 3 per cent solution of carbolic acid, 3 per cent\r\nsolution of compound cresol, 1 to 1,000 bichlorid of mercury, or 1 per\r\ncent permanganate of potash solution. If the abscesses are foul and bad\r\nsmelling, their cavities should first be syringed with 1 part of\r\nhydrogen peroxid to 2 parts of water and then followed by the injection\r\nof any of the above-mentioned antiseptics.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLD ABSCESSES.\r\n\r\nCold abscess is the term applied to those large, indolent swellings that\r\nare the result of a low or chronic form of inflammation, in the center\r\nof which there is a small collection of pus. They are often seen near\r\nthe point of the shoulder, forming the so-called breast boil. The\r\nswelling is diffuse and of enormous extent, but slightly hotter than\r\nsurrounding parts, and not very painful upon pressure. A pronounced\r\nstiffness, rather than pain, is evinced upon moving the animal. Such\r\nabscesses have the appearance of a hard tumor, surrounded by a softer\r\nedematous swelling, involving the tissues to the extent of a foot or\r\nmore in all directions from the tumor. This diffused swelling gradually\r\nsubsides and leaves the large, hardened mass somewhat well defined. One\r\nof the characteristics of cold abscesses is their tendency to remain in\r\nthe same condition for a great length of time. There is neither heat nor\r\nsoreness; no increase nor lessening in the size of the tumor; it remains\r\nin statu quo. If, however, the animal should be put to work for a short\r\ntime the irritation of the collar causes the surrounding tissues to\r\nassume again an edematous condition, which after a few days' rest\r\ndisappears, leaving the tumor as before or but slightly larger. Upon\r\ncareful manipulation we may discover what appears to be a fluid deep\r\nseated in the center of the mass. The quantity of matter so contained is\r\nvery small--often not more than a tablespoonful--and for this reason it\r\ncan not, in all cases, be detected.\r\n\r\nCold abscesses are mostly, if not always, caused by the long-continued\r\nirritation of a loose and badly fitting collar. There is a slow\r\ninflammatory action going on, which results in the formation of a small\r\nquantity of matter inclosed in very thick and but partially organized\r\nwalls that are not so well defined as is the circumference of fibrous\r\ntumors, which they most resemble.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The means recommended to bring the acute abscess \"to a\r\nhead\" are but rarely effectual with this variety; or, if successful, too\r\nmuch time has been occupied in the cure. We must look for other and more\r\nrapid methods of treatment. These consist, first of all, in carefully\r\nexploring the tumor for the presence of pus. The incisions must be made\r\nover the softest part and carried deep into the tumor--to its very\r\nbottom, if necessary--and the matter allowed to escape. After this, and\r\nwhether we have found matter or not, we must induce an active\r\ninflammation of the tumor, in order to promote solution of the thick\r\nwalls of the abscess. This may be done by inserting well into the\r\nincision a piece of oakum or cotton saturated with turpentine, carbolic\r\nacid, tincture of iodin, etc., or we may pack the incision with powdered\r\nsulphate of zinc and keep the orifice plugged for 24 hours. These agents\r\nset up a destructive inflammation of the walls. Suppuration follows, and\r\nthis should now be encouraged by hot fomentations and poultices. The\r\norifice must be kept open, and should it be disposed to heal we must\r\nagain introduce some of the agents above described. A favored treatment\r\nwith many, and it is probably the best, is to plunge a red-hot iron to\r\nthe bottom of the incision and thoroughly sear all parts of the walls of\r\nthe abscess. This is to be repeated after the first slough has taken\r\nplace if the walls remain thickened and indurated.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to waste time with fomentations, poultices, or blisters in\r\nthe treatment of cold abscesses, since though apparently removed by such\r\nmethods, they almost invariably return when the horse is put to work.\r\nExtirpation by the knife is not practicable, as the walls of the tumor\r\nare not sufficiently defined. If treated as above directed, and properly\r\nfitted with a good collar after healing, there will not remain any track\r\nor trace of the large, unsightly mass.\r\n\r\n\r\nFISTULAS.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--The word fistula is applied to any ulcerous lesion upon\r\nthe external surface of the body which is connected by ducts, or\r\npassages, with some internal cavity. Because of this particular\r\nformation the term fistulous tract is often used synonymously with the\r\nword fistula. Fistulas may exist in any part of the body, but the name\r\nhas come to be commonly accepted as applicable only to such lesions when\r\nfound upon the withers. Poll evil is a fistula upon the poll, and in no\r\nsense differs from fistulous withers except in location. The description\r\nof fistula will apply, then, in the main, to poll evil equally well.\r\nQuittor presents the characteristic tubular passages of a fistula and\r\nmay, therefore, be considered and treated as fistula of the foot.\r\nFistulous passages may also be developed upon the sides of the face,\r\nthrough which saliva is discharged instead of flowing into the mouth,\r\nand are called salivary fistulas. A dental fistula may arise from the\r\nnecrosis of the root of a tooth. Again, a fistula is sometimes noted at\r\nthe umbilicus associated with hernia, and recto-vaginal fistulas have\r\nbeen developed in mares, following difficult parturition. Fistulas may\r\narise from wounds of glandular organs or their ducts, and thus we have\r\nthe so-called mammary or lacrimal fistulas.\r\n\r\nFistulous tracts are lined with a false, or adventitious, membrane and\r\nshow no disposition to heal. They constantly afford means of exit to the\r\npus or ichorous material discharged by the unhealthy parts below. They\r\nare particularly liable to develop at the withers or poll because of the\r\nexposed positions which these parts occupy, and, having once become\r\nlocated there, they usually assert a tendency to further extension,\r\nbecause the vertical and laminated formation of the muscles and tendons\r\nof these parts allows the forces of gravitation to assist the pus in\r\ngaining the deeper-lying structures and also favors its retention among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Fistulas follow as a result of abscesses, bruises, wounds, or\r\nlong-continued irritation by the harness. Among the more common causes\r\nof fistula of the poll (poll evil) are chafing by the halter or heavy\r\nbridle; blows from the butt end of the whip; the horse striking his head\r\nagainst the hayrack, beams of the ceiling, low doors, etc. Fistulous\r\nwithers are seen mostly in those horses that have thick necks as well as\r\nthose that are very high in the withers; or, among saddle horses, those\r\nthat are very low in the withers, the saddle here riding forward and\r\nbruising the parts. In either of these locations ulcers of the skin, or\r\nsimple abscesses, if not properly and punctually treated, may become\r\nfistulas. They are often caused by bad-fitting collars or saddles, by\r\ndirect injuries from blows, and from the horse rolling upon rough or\r\nsharp stones. The pus burrows and finds lodgment deep down between the\r\nmuscles, and escapes only when the sinus becomes surcharged or when,\r\nduring motion of the parts, the matter is forced to the surface.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--These, of course, will vary according to the progress made\r\nby the fistula. Following an injury we may often notice soreness or\r\nstiffness of the front legs, and upon careful examination of the withers\r\nwe see small tortuous lines running from the point of irritation\r\ndownward and backward over the region of the shoulder. These are\r\nsuperficial lymphatics, and are swollen and painful to the touch. In a\r\nday or two a swelling is noticed on one or both sides of the dorsal\r\nvertebrae, which is hot, painful, and rapidly enlarging. The stiffness of\r\nthe limbs may disappear at this time, and the heat and soreness of the\r\nparts may become less noticeable, but the swelling remains and continues\r\nto enlarge.\r\n\r\nA fistulous ulcer of the poll may be first indicated by the opposition\r\nwhich the animal offers to the application of stable brush or bridle. At\r\nthis time the parts are so sore and sensitive that there is some danger\r\nthat unless handled with the greatest care the patient will acquire\r\ndisagreeable stable habits. The disease in its early stages may be\r\nrecognized as a soft, fluctuating tumor surrounded by inflammatory\r\nswelling, with the presence of enlarged lymphatic vessels and stiffness\r\nof the neck. Later the inflammation of the surrounding tissues may\r\ndisappear, leaving a prominent tumor. The swelling, whether situated\r\nupon the head or the withers, may open and form a running ulcer, or its\r\ncontents may dry up and leave a tumor which gradually develops the\r\ncommon characteristics of a fibrous tumor. When the enlargement has\r\nopened we should carefully examine its cavity, as upon its condition\r\nwill wholly depend our treatment.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In the earliest stage, when there is soreness, enlarged\r\nlymphatics, but no well-marked swelling, the trouble may frequently be\r\naborted. To do this requires both general and local treatment. A physic\r\nshould be given, and the horse receive 1 ounce of powdered saltpeter\r\nthree times a day in his water or feed. If the fever runs high, 20-drop\r\ndoses of tincture of aconite root every two hours may be administered.\r\nThe local application of cold water to the inflamed spot for an hour at\r\na time three or four times a day has often proved very beneficial, and\r\nhas afforded great relief.\r\n\r\nCooling lotions, muriate of ammonia, or saltpeter and water; sedative\r\nwashes, such as tincture of opium and aconite, chloroform liniment, or\r\ncamphorated oil, are also to be frequently applied. Should this\r\ntreatment fail to check the progress of the trouble, the formation of\r\npus should be hastened as rapidly as possible. Hot fomentations and\r\npoultices are to be constantly used, and as soon as the presence of pus\r\ncan be detected, the abscess wall is to be opened at its lowest point.\r\nIn this procedure lies our hope of a speedy cure. As with any simple\r\nabscess, if drainage can be so provided that the pus will run off as\r\nfast as formed without remaining within the interstices of the tissues,\r\nthe healing will be rapid and satisfactory.\r\n\r\nAttention is again called to the directions given above as to the\r\nnecessity of probing the cavity when opened. If upon a careful\r\nexamination with the probe we find that there are no pockets, no\r\nsinuses, but a simple, regular abscess wall, the indication for\r\ntreatment is to make an opening from below so that all the matter must\r\nescape. Rarely is anything more needed than to keep the orifice open and\r\nto bathe or inject the parts with some simple antiseptic wash that is\r\nnot irritant or caustic. A low opening and cleanliness constitute the\r\nessential and rational treatment.\r\n\r\nIf the abscess has already opened, giving vent to a quantity of purulent\r\nmatter, and the pipes and tubes leading from the opening are found to be\r\nextensive and surrounded with thick fungoid membranes, there is\r\nconsiderable danger that the internal ligaments or even some of the\r\nbones have become affected, in which case the condition has assumed a\r\nserious aspect. Or, on the other hand, if the abscess has existed for\r\nsome time without a rupture, its contents will frequently be found to\r\nconsist of dried purulent matter, firm and dense, and the walls\r\nsurrounding the mass will be found greatly thickened. In such a case we\r\nmust generally have recourse to the application of caustics which will\r\ncause a sloughing of all of the unhealthy tissue, and will also\r\nstimulate a rapid increase of healthy organized material to replace that\r\ndestroyed in the course of the development and treatment of the disease.\r\nThreads or cords soaked in gum-arabic solution and rolled in powdered\r\ncorrosive sublimate may be introduced into the canal and allowed to\r\nremain. The skin on all parts of the shoulder and leg beneath the\r\nfistula should be carefully greased with lard or oil, as this will\r\nprevent the discharge that comes from the opening after the caustic is\r\nintroduced from irritating or blistering the skin over which it flows.\r\nIn obstinate cases a piece of caustic potash (fused) 1 to 2 inches in\r\nlength may be introduced into the opening and should be covered with\r\noakum or cotton. The horse should then be secured so that he can not\r\nreach the part with his teeth. After the caustic plug has been in place\r\nfor 24 hours, it may be removed and hot fomentations applied. As soon as\r\nthe discharge has become again established the abscess should be opened\r\nfrom its lowest extremity, and the passage thus formed may be kept open\r\nby the introduction of a seton. If the pipes become established in the\r\ndeep tissues beneath the shoulder blade or among the spines of the\r\nvertebral column, it will often be found impossible to provide proper\r\ndrainage for the abscess from below, and treatment must consist of\r\ncaustic solutions carefully injected into all parts of the suppurating\r\nsinuses. A very effective remedy for this purpose consists of 1 ounce of\r\nchlorid of zinc in half a pint of water, injected three times during a\r\nweek, after which a weak solution of the same may be occasionally\r\ninjected. Injections of Villate's solution or alcoholic solution of\r\ncorrosive sublimate, strong carbolic acid, or possibly oil of turpentine\r\nwill also prove beneficial. Pressure should be applied from below, and\r\nendeavors made to heal the various pipes from the bottom.\r\n\r\nShould the swelling become general, without forming a well-defined\r\ntumor, the placing of 20 to 30 grains of arsenious acid, wrapped in a\r\nsingle layer of tissue paper, in a shallow incision beneath the skin,\r\nwill often produce a sloughing of the affected parts in a week or 10\r\ndays, after which the formation of healthy tissue follows. The\r\nsurrounding parts of the skin should be protected from any damage from\r\nescaping caustics by the application of lard or oil, as previously\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\nAlthough the successful treatment of fistulas requires time and\r\npatience, the majority of cases are curable. The sinuses must be opened\r\nat their lowest extremity and kept open. Caustic applications must be\r\nthoroughly used once or twice, after which mild astringent antiseptic\r\nwashes should be persistently used until a cure is reached.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that the erosions have burrowed so deeply or in\r\nsuch a direction that the opening of a drainage passage becomes\r\nimpracticable. In other cases the bones may be attacked in some\r\ninaccessible location, or the joints may be affected, and in these cases\r\nit is often best to destroy the horse at once.\r\n\r\nThe reappearance of the fistula after it has apparently healed is not\r\nuncommon. The secondary attack in these cases is seldom serious. The\r\nlesion should be carefully cleaned and afterwards injected with a\r\nsolution of zinc sulphate, 20 grains to the ounce of water, every second\r\nor third day until a cure is effected.\r\n\r\nIn fistula of the foot we see the same tendency toward the burrowing of\r\npus downward to lower structures, or in some cases upward toward the\r\ncoronet. Prior to the development of a quittor there is always swelling\r\nat the coronet, accompanied with heat and pain. Every effort should now\r\nbe made to prevent the formation of an abscess at the point of injury.\r\nWounds caused by nails, gravel, or any other foreign body which may have\r\nlodged in the sole of the foot should be opened at once from below, so\r\nas to allow free exit to all purulent discharges. Should the injury have\r\noccurred directly to the coronet the application of cold fomentations\r\nmay prove efficient in preventing the formation of an abscess.\r\n\r\nWhen a quittor becomes fully established it should be treated precisely\r\nas a fistula situated in any other part of the body; that is, the\r\nsinuses should all be opened from their lowest extremities, so as to\r\nafford constant drainage. All fragments of diseased tissue should be\r\ntrimmed away, antiseptic solutions injected, and, after covering the\r\nwound with a pad of oakum saturated with some good antiseptic wash, the\r\nwhole foot may be carefully covered with clean bandages, which will\r\nafford valuable assistance to the healing process by excluding all dirt\r\nfrom the affected part.\r\n\r\nAnother form of treatment for this class of infections consists in the\r\nuse of bacterial vaccines. Such treatment appears to be well adapted for\r\nthe purpose, and according to current veterinary literature has met with\r\nsuccess. These vaccines are composed of several strains of the organisms\r\nusually found in these pustular infections of the horse. Two kinds of\r\nvaccines are used: First, autogenic vaccines, which consist of heated\r\n(killed) cultures of the organism or organisms which are causing the\r\ntrouble and which have been isolated from the lesions; second, stock\r\nvaccines, consisting of dead organisms of certain species generally\r\nfound in these lesions and which are used in diseased conditions caused\r\nby one or the other of these germs. The vaccine is administered\r\nsubcutaneously by means of a syringe, but the quantity of the vaccine to\r\nbe injected and the number of doses to be used should be left to the\r\njudgment of a competent veterinarian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINFECTIOUS DISEASES.\r\n\r\nBy RUSH SHIPPEN HUIDEKOPER, M. D., Vet.\r\n\r\n[Revised by A. Eichhorn, D. V. S.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL DISCUSSION.\r\n\r\nAn infectious disease may be defined as any malady caused by the\r\nintroduction into the body of minute organisms of the vegetable or\r\nanimal kingdom which have the power to multiply indefinitely and set\r\nfree certain peculiar poisons which are chiefly responsible for morbid\r\nchanges. Nearly all diseases of animals for which a definite cause may\r\nbe attributed are caused by bacteria; such are tuberculosis, anthrax,\r\nblackleg, lockjaw, and others. There are some diseases, as, for\r\ninstance, Texas fever and rabies, which are caused by a minute animal\r\nparasite known as protozoa, while others again, like lumpy jaw and\r\naspergillosis, are caused by fungi. Besides there are infectious\r\ndiseases in which the causative agents have never been successfully\r\nisolated, as they are so small that they can not be detected by the aid\r\nof the most powerful microscope, and accordingly they are termed as\r\nultravisible viruses. Hog cholera, foot-and-mouth disease, smallpox, and\r\nothers belong to this group.\r\n\r\nBacteria may be defined as very minute unicellular organisms of\r\nplantlike character. They multiply either by simple division or by spore\r\nformation, the latter usually taking place when the conditions\r\npertaining to the growth of the bacteria become unfavorable. The spores\r\nare much more resistant to destruction than the bacteria which produce\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAnother group of parasites producing disease is known as protozoa. These\r\nare more complex than bacteria, and their artificial cultivation is also\r\nmuch more difficult than is the case with the bacterial parasites. Of\r\nthe representatives of this group, causing disease in animals, are the\r\ntrypanosomes, which are the causative factors of dourine and surra, and\r\nthe piroplasma, which induce Texas fever in cattle and malaria or\r\nbiliary fever of horses. There are also disease-producing fungi which\r\nare responsible for certain affections in horses; among these the most\r\nimportant are mycotic lymphangitis, or sporotrichosis, and\r\nstreptotrichosis.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the infection may take place in various ways. The\r\nmost frequent method is by ingestion. Further, the entrance of the\r\ngerms may occur by inhalation, skin abrasions, wounds of any kind,\r\nthrough the genital organs, and at times also through the milk ducts of\r\nthe teats. As a general rule infectious diseases have a period of\r\nincubation which comprises the time elapsing between the exposure to the\r\ninfection and the actual appearance of the disease. This period varies\r\nin the different diseases.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of infectious diseases is, as a rule, unsatisfactory. When\r\nthe symptoms have once appeared a disease is liable to run its course in\r\nspite of treatment, and if it is one from which animals usually recover,\r\nall that can be done is to put them into the most favorable\r\nsurroundings. Many infectious diseases lead sooner or later to death;\r\ntreatment is useless so far as the sick animals are concerned, and it\r\nmay be worse than useless for those not yet affected. All animals\r\nsuffering with infectious diseases are more or less directly a menace to\r\nall others. They represent for the time being manufactories of disease\r\ngerms, and they are giving them off more or less abundantly during the\r\nperiod of disease. They may infect others directly or they may scatter\r\nthe virus about and the surroundings may become the future source of\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in the control of infectious diseases prevention is the most\r\nimportant procedure. The isolation or segregation of healthy animals\r\nfrom infected ones should be primarily considered, and if at any time an\r\nanimal manifests the symptoms of an infectious disease it is essential\r\nto protect the others from such a source of danger. In some of the\r\ninfectious diseases it may become advisable to kill the infected animals\r\nin order to avoid the spread of the disease. This is especially\r\nimportant in diseases which are slow in their course, such as\r\ntuberculosis. At times when diseases appear in a country where they have\r\nnot been prevalent it becomes advisable and necessary to protect the\r\nhealthy herds by the slaughter of all the infected animals. Pursuance of\r\nthis policy has resulted in control of the foot-and-mouth disease, and\r\nhas proved to be a very satisfactory method of eradication.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISINFECTION.\r\n\r\nDisinfection is a very important phase in the control of infectious\r\ndisease. This consists in the use of certain substances which possess\r\nthe power to destroy bacteria or their spores, or both. The cheapest and\r\nmost available for animal diseases are ordinary freshly slaked lime, or\r\nunslaked lime in powder form, chlorid of lime, crude carbolic acid,\r\ncorrosive sublimate, formalin, formaldehyde, gas, cresol, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the disinfection of stables and premises it is essential to execute\r\nthe work in a most thorough manner. This may be satisfactorily\r\naccomplished by carrying out the following directions:\r\n\r\n1. Sweep ceilings, side walls, stall partitions, floors, and other\r\nsurfaces until free from cobwebs and dust.\r\n\r\n2. Scrape away all accumulation of filth, and if woodwork has become\r\ndecayed, porous, or absorbent, it should be removed, burned, and\r\nreplaced with new material.\r\n\r\n3. If floor is of earth, remove 4 inches from the surface, and in places\r\nstained with urine a sufficient depth should be replaced to expose fresh\r\nearth. All earth removed should be replaced with earth from an\r\nuncontaminated source; it would be better still to lay a new floor of\r\nconcrete, which is very durable and easily cleaned.\r\n\r\n4. All refuse and material from stable and barnyard should be removed to\r\na place not accessible to cattle or hogs. The manure should be spread on\r\nfields and turned under, while the wood should be burned.\r\n\r\n5. The entire interior of the stable, especially the feeding troughs and\r\ndrains, should be saturated with a disinfectant, as liquor cresolis\r\ncompositus (U. S. P.), or carbolic acid, 6 ounces to every gallon of\r\nwater, to which 4 ounces of chlorid of lime should be added. The best\r\nmethod of applying the disinfectant and the lime wash is by means of a\r\nstrong spray pump, such as those used by orchardists. This method is\r\nefficient in disinfection against most of the contagious and infectious\r\ndiseases of animals, and should be applied immediately following any\r\noutbreak, and, as a matter of precaution, it may be used once or twice\r\nyearly.\r\n\r\n6. It is important that arrangements be made to admit a plentiful supply\r\nof sunlight and fresh air by providing an ample number of windows,\r\nthereby eliminating dampness, bad odor, and other insanitary conditions.\r\nGood drainage is also very necessary.\r\n\r\nIf the use of liquor cresolis compositus, carbolic acid, or other\r\ncoal-tar products is inadmissible because of the readiness with which\r\ntheir odor is imparted to milk and other dairy products, bichlorid of\r\nmercury may be used in proportion of 1 to 800, or 1 pound of bichlorid\r\nto 100 gallons of water. All portions of the stable soiled with manure,\r\nhowever, should first be thoroughly scraped and cleaned, as the albumin\r\ncontained in manure would otherwise greatly diminish the disinfecting\r\npower of the bichlorid. Disinfection with this material should be\r\nsupervised by a veterinarian or other person trained in the handling of\r\npoisonous drugs and chemicals, as the bichlorid is a powerful, corrosive\r\npoison. The mangers and the feed boxes, after drying, following spraying\r\nwith this material, should be washed out with hot water, as cattle are\r\nespecially susceptible to mercurial poisoning. The bichlorid solution\r\nshould be applied by means of a spray pump, as recommended for the\r\nliquor cresolis compositus.\r\n\r\n\r\nVACCINATION.\r\n\r\nIn recent years vaccination for the prevention of certain infectious\r\ndiseases has been successfully developed, and without a doubt the future\r\nhas a great deal in store for this phase of prevention. At the present\r\ntime vaccination has been found effective against blackleg, hog cholera,\r\nanthrax, lockjaw, strangles, rabies, hemorrhagic septicemia, white\r\nscours, etc. It is always essential, of course, that the products used\r\nfor the vaccination be pure and potent; also they should be employed\r\nonly with the advice of competent authorities and with proper care. The\r\nbiological products prepared for the cure and prevention of infections\r\nare prepared by manufacturers who, in order to conduct an interstate\r\nbusiness, are required to obtain a license from the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture for the manufacture of such preparations.\r\n\r\nSince July 1, 1913, the Department of Agriculture, by an act of Congress\r\nof March 4, 1913, has had control of the manufacture of biological\r\nproducts for the treatment of domestic animals. The numerous complaints\r\nwhich were received from time to time relative to the impotency of some\r\nof the preparations, and also the fact that in some instances the use of\r\nthe products were directly responsible in causing outbreaks of disease,\r\nmade the necessity for such control obvious. This supervision is no\r\ndoubt of far-reaching importance, as it assures the users that the\r\npreparations are reliable.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENZA.\r\n\r\n     _Synonyms._--Pinkeye, typhoid fever, epizooty, epihippic fever,\r\n     hepatic fever, bilious fever, etc.; flevre typhoide, grippe\r\n     (French); Pferdestaupe (German); gastro-enteritis of Vatel and\r\n     d'Arboval; febris erysipelatodes, Zundel; typhus of Delafond.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--The term influenza is applied to a febrile, contagious,\r\ninfectious disease of horses, which is characterized by a blood\r\ninfection, with inflammation of the mucous membranes, which frequently\r\ninvolves the lungs. Inflammatory complications also occur in the form of\r\nswellings of the subcutis, tendons, and tendinous sheaths and laminae of\r\nthe feet. The causative agent has not been satisfactorily established.\r\nOne attack usually protects the animal from future ones of the same\r\ndisease, but not always. An apparently complete recovery is sometimes\r\nfollowed by serious sequelae of the nervous and blood-vessel systems.\r\nUnder certain conditions of the atmosphere or from unknown causes, the\r\ndisease is very liable to assume an epizootic form, with tendency to\r\ncomplications of especial organs, as, at one period, the lungs, at\r\nanother the intestines, etc.\r\n\r\nThe first description of influenza is given by Laurentius Rusius in\r\n1301, when it spread over a considerable portion of Italy, causing\r\ngreat loss among the war horses of Rome and the surrounding district.\r\nLater, in 1648, an epizootic of this disease visited Germany and spread\r\nto other parts of Europe. In 1711, under the name of \"epidemica\r\nequorum,\" it followed the tracks of the great armies all over Europe,\r\ncausing immense losses among the horses, while rinderpest was scourging\r\nthe cattle of the same regions. The two diseases were confounded with\r\neach other, and were, by the scientists of the day, supposed to be\r\nallied to the typhus, which was a plague to the human race at the same\r\ntime. We find the first advent of this disease to the British Islands in\r\nan epizootic among the horses of London and the southern counties of\r\nEngland in 1732, which is described by Gibson. In 1758 Robert Whytt\r\nrecounts the devastation of the horses of the north of Scotland from the\r\nsame trouble. Throughout the eighteenth century a number of epizootics\r\noccurred in Hanover and other portions of Germany and in France, which\r\nwere renewed early in the present century, with complications of the\r\nintestinal tract, which obtained for it its name of gastro-enteritis. In\r\n1766 it first attacked the horses in North America, but is not described\r\nas again occurring in a severe form until 1870-1872, when it spread over\r\nthe entire country, from Canada south to Ohio, and then eastward to the\r\nAtlantic and westward to California. It is now a permanent disease in\r\nour large cities, selecting for the continuance of its virulence young\r\nor especially susceptible horses which pass through the large and\r\nill-ventilated and uncleaned stables of dealers, and assumes from time\r\nto time an enzootic form, when from some reason its virulence increases.\r\nIt assumes this form also when, from reasons of rural economy and\r\ncommerce, large numbers of young and more susceptible animals are\r\nexposed to its contagion.\r\n\r\n_Etiology._--The experiments of Dieckerhoff many years ago proved that\r\nthe disease may be transmitted to healthy animals by intravenous\r\ninjection of warm blood from affected horses.\r\n\r\nFurther investigations revealed the fact that blood from affected\r\nhorses, even when passed through porcelain filters, may transmit the\r\ndisease, thereby proving that the causative agent belongs to the\r\nso-called filterable viruses. This has been further substantiated by\r\nGaffky, who showed in his recent experiments that the disease may be\r\ntransmitted with defibrinated as well as with filtered blood, in which\r\ncases the typical form of influenza developed in inoculated animals in\r\nfrom five to six days. These findings were also substantiated by Basset.\r\nFurther observations have also proved that apparently recovered animals\r\nmay harbor the infection for a long time and still be capable of\r\ntransmitting the disease. Such virus carriers are no doubt responsible\r\nfor numerous outbreaks of this disease when, in a locality free from\r\nthe disease, it certainly appears after the introduction of an\r\napparently healthy animal.\r\n\r\nAs one attack is usually self-protective, numbers of old horses, having\r\nhad an earlier attack, are not capable of contracting it again; but,\r\naside from this, young horses, especially those about four or five years\r\nof age, are much more predisposed to be attacked, while the older ones,\r\neven if they have not had the disease, are less liable to it. Again, the\r\nformer age is that in which the horse is brought from the farm, where it\r\nhas been free from the risk of exposure, and is sold to pass through the\r\nstables of the country taverns, the dirty, infected railway cars, and\r\nthe foul stockyards and damp stables of dealers in our large cities.\r\nOverfed, fat, young horses which have just come through the sales\r\nstables are much more susceptible to contagion than the same horses are\r\nafter a few months of steady work.\r\n\r\nPilger, in 1805, was the first to recognize infection as the direct\r\ncause of the disease. Roll and others studied the contagiousness of\r\ninfluenza, and, finding it so much more virulent and permanent in old\r\nstables than elsewhere, classed it as a \"stall miasm.\" The contagion\r\nwill remain in the straw bedding and droppings of the animal and in the\r\nfeed in an infected stable for a considerable time and if these are\r\nremoved to other localities it may be carried in them. It may be carried\r\nin the clothing of those who have been in attendance on horses suffering\r\nfrom the disease. The drinking water in troughs and even running water\r\nmay hold the virus and be a means of its communication to other animals,\r\neven at a distance.\r\n\r\nThe studies of Dieckerhoff, in 1881, in regard to the contagion of\r\ninfluenza were especially interesting. He found that during a local\r\nenzootic, produced by the introduction of infected horses into an\r\nextensive stable otherwise perfectly healthy, the infection took place\r\nin what at first seemed to be a most irregular manner, but which was\r\nshown later to be dependent on the ventilation and currents of air\r\nthrough the various buildings. His experiments showed that the virus of\r\ninfluenza is excessively diffusible, and that it will spread rapidly to\r\nthe roof of a building and pass by the apertures of ventilation to\r\nothers in the neighborhood. The writer has seen cases that have appeared\r\nto spread through a brick wall and attack animals on the opposite side\r\nbefore others even in the same stable were affected. Brick walls, old\r\nwoodwork, and the dirt which is too frequently left about the feed boxes\r\nof a horse stall will hold the contagion for several days, if not weeks,\r\nand communicate it to susceptible animals when placed in the same\r\nlocality. On two successive mornings a 4-year-old colt belonging to the\r\nwriter stood for about 10 minutes at the open door, fully 40 feet from\r\nthe stalls, of a stable in which two cases of influenza had broken out\r\nthe day before: in six days the colt developed the disease. On the\r\nmorning when the trouble in the colt was recognized it stood in an\r\ninfirmary with a dozen horses that were being treated for various\r\ndiseases, but was immediately isolated; within one week two-thirds of\r\nthe other horses had contracted the disease.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--After the exposure of a susceptible horse to infection a\r\nperiod of incubation of from four to seven days elapses, during which\r\nthe animal seems in perfect health, before any symptom is visible. When\r\nthe symptoms of influenza develop they may be intense, or so moderate as\r\nto occasion but little alarm, but the latter condition frequently\r\nexposes the animal to use and to the danger of the exciting causes of\r\ncomplications which would not have happened had it been left quietly in\r\nits stall in place of being worked or driven out to show to prospective\r\npurchasers. The disease may run a simple course as a specific fever,\r\nwith alterations only of the blood, or at any period it may become\r\ncomplicated by local inflammatory troubles, the gravity of which is\r\naugmented by developing in an animal with an impoverished blood, an\r\nalready irritated, rapid circulation, and defective nutritive and\r\nreparative functions.\r\n\r\nThe first symptoms are those of a rapidly developing fever, which\r\nbecomes intense within a very short period. The animal becomes dejected\r\nand inattentive to surrounding objects; stands with its head down, and\r\nnot back on the halter as in serious lung diseases. In the flanks, the\r\nmuscles of the croup and of the shoulders, or of the entire body it has\r\nchills lasting from 15 to 30 minutes, and frequently a grinding of the\r\nteeth which warns one that a severe attack may be expected. The hairs\r\nbecome dry and rough and stand on end. The body temperature increases to\r\n104 deg., 104.5 deg., and 105 deg. F., or even in severe cases to 107 deg. F., within\r\nthe first twelve or eighteen hours. The horse becomes stupid, stands\r\nimmobile with its head hanging, the ears listless, and it pays but\r\nlittle attention to the surrounding attendants or the crack of a whip.\r\nThe stupor becomes rapidly more marked, the eyes become puffy and\r\nswollen with excessive lacrimation, so that the tears run from the\r\ninternal canthus of the eye over the cheeks and may blister the skin in\r\ntheir course. The respiration becomes accelerated to 25 or 30 in a\r\nminute, and the pulse is quickened to 70, 80, or even 100, moderate in\r\nvolume and in force. There is great depression of muscular force; the\r\nanimal stands limp, as if excessively fatigued. There is diminution, or\r\nin some cases total loss, of sensibility of the skin, so that it may be\r\npricked or handled without attracting the attention of the animal. On\r\nmovement, the horse staggers and shows a want of coordination of all the\r\nmuscles of its limbs. The senses of hearing, sight, and taste are\r\ndiminished, if not entirely destroyed. The visible mucous membranes (as\r\nthe conjunctiva), from which it received the name pinkeye, and the\r\nmouth, and the natural openings become of a deep saffron, ocher, or\r\nviolet-red color. This latter is especially noticeable on the rim of the\r\ngums and is a condition not found in any other disease, so that it is an\r\nalmost diagnostic symptom. In some outbreaks there is much more swelling\r\nof the lids and weeping from the eyes than in others. If the animal is\r\nbled at this period the blood is found more coagulable than normal, but\r\nat a later period it becomes of a dark color and less coagulable. There\r\nis great diminution or total loss of appetite, with an excessive thirst,\r\nbut in many cases cold-blooded horses may retain a certain amount of\r\nappetite, eating slowly at hay, oats, or other feed. There is some\r\nirritation of the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract, as shown by\r\ndischarge of mucus from the nose, and by cough. Pregnant mares are\r\nliable to abort.\r\n\r\nWe have, following the fever, a tumefaction, or edema, of the\r\nsubcutaneous tissues at the fetlocks, of the under surface of the belly,\r\nand of the sheath of the penis, which may be excessive. The infiltration\r\nis noninflammatory in character and produces an insensibility of the\r\nskin like the excessive stocking which we see in debilitated animals\r\nafter exposure to cold. In ordinary cases the temperature has reached\r\nits maximum of 105 deg. or 106 deg. F. in from 24 to 48 hours from the origin of\r\nthe fever. It remains stationary for a period of from 3 to 4 days\r\nwithout so much variation between morning and evening temperature as we\r\nhave in pneumonia or other serious diseases of the lungs. At the\r\ntermination of the specific course of the disease, which is generally\r\nfrom 6 to 10 days, the fever abates, the swelling of the legs and under\r\nsurface of belly diminishes, the appetite returns, the strength is\r\nrapidly regained, the mucous membranes lose their yellowish color, which\r\nthey attain so rapidly at the commencement of the disease, and the\r\nanimal convalesces promptly to its ordinary good condition and health,\r\nand rapidly regains the large amount of weight which it lost in the\r\nearly part of the disease, a loss which frequently reaches 30, 50, or\r\neven 75 pounds each 24 hours. For the first three days of the high\r\ntemperature there is a great tendency to constipation, which should be\r\navoided if possible by the use of the means recommended below, for, if\r\nit has been marked, it may be followed by a troublesome diarrhea.\r\n\r\n_Terminations._--The terminations of simple influenza may be death by\r\nextreme fever, with failure of the heart's action; from excessive coma,\r\ndue generally to a rapid congestion of the brain; to the poisonous\r\neffects of the debris of the disintegrated blood corpuscles and the\r\ntoxin of the disease; to an asphyxia, following congestion of the lungs;\r\nor the disease terminates by subsidence of the fever, return of the\r\nappetite and nutritive functions of the organs, and rapid\r\nconvalescence; or, in an unfortunately large number of cases, the\r\ncourse of the disease is complicated by local inflammatory troubles,\r\nwhose gravity is greater in influenza than it is when they occur as\r\nsporadic diseases.\r\n\r\n_Complications._--The complications are congestions, followed by\r\ninflammatory phenomena in the various organs of the body, but they are\r\nmost commonly located in the intestines, lungs, brain, or vascular\r\nlaminae of the feet. Atmospheric influence or other surrounding\r\ninfluences of unknown quality seem to be an important factor in the\r\ndetermination of the local lesions. At certain seasons of the year, and\r\nin certain epizootics, we find 40 and 50 per cent or even a greater\r\npercentage of the cases rendered more serious by complication of the\r\nintestines; at other seasons of the year, or in other epizootics, we\r\nfind the same percentage of cases complicated by inflammation of the\r\nlungs, while at the same time a small percentage of them are complicated\r\nby troubles of the other organs; inflammatory changes of the brain, of\r\nthe laminae, more rarely commence in epizootic form, but are to be found\r\nin a certain small percentage of cases in all epizootics.\r\n\r\nExciting causes are important factors in complicating individual cases\r\nof influenza, or in localizing special lesions, during either enzootics\r\nor epizootics. These exciting or determining causes act much as they\r\nwould in sporadic inflammatory diseases, but in this case we find the\r\nanimal much more susceptible and predisposed to be acted upon than\r\nordinary healthy animals. With a temperature already elevated, with the\r\nheart's action driving the blood in increased quantity into the\r\ndistended blood vessels, which become dilated and lose their\r\ncontractility, with a congestion of all the vascular organs already\r\nestablished, it takes but little additional irritation to carry the\r\ncongestion one step further and produce inflammation.\r\n\r\n_Complication of the intestines._--When any cause acts as an irritant to\r\nthe intestinal tract during the course of this specific fever it may\r\nproduce inflammation of the organs belonging to it. This cause may be\r\nconstipation, which can find relief only in a congestion which offers to\r\nincrease the function of the glands and relieve the inertia caused by a\r\ntemporary cessation of activity; or irritant medicines, especially any\r\nincreased use of antimony, turpentine, or the more active remedies; the\r\ntaking of indigestible feed, or of feed in too great quantities, or that\r\nhas been altered in any way by fungus or other injurious alterations;\r\nthe swallowing of too cold water; or any other irritant may cause\r\ncongestion. This complication is ushered in by colics. The animal paws\r\nwith the fore feet and evinces a great sensibility of the belly; it\r\nlooks with the head from side to side, and may lie down and get up, not\r\nwith violence, but with care for itself, perfectly protecting the\r\nsurface of the belly from any violence. At first we find a decided\r\nconstipation; the droppings if passed are small and hard, coated with a\r\nviscous varnish or even with false membranes. In from 36 to 40 hours the\r\nconstipation is followed by diarrhea. The alimentary discharge becomes\r\nmixed with a sero-mucous exudation, which is followed by a certain\r\namount of suppurative matter. The animal becomes rapidly exhausted and\r\nunstable, staggers on movement, losing the little appetite which may\r\nhave remained, and has exacerbations of fever. The pulse becomes softer\r\nand weaker, the respiration becomes gradually more rapid, the\r\ntemperature is about 1 deg. to 1.5 deg. F. higher. If a fatal result is not\r\nproduced by the extensive diarrhea the discharge is arrested in from 5\r\nto 10 days and a rapid recovery takes place.\r\n\r\n_Complication of the lungs._--If at any time during the course of the\r\nfever the animal is exposed to cold or drafts of air, or in any other\r\nway to the causes of repercussion, the lungs may become affected. In the\r\nmajority of cases, however, after three, four, or five days of the\r\nfever, congestion of the lungs commences without any exposure or\r\napparent exciting cause. Unless this congestion of the lungs is soon\r\nrelieved it is followed by an inflammation constituting pneumonia. This\r\npneumonia, while it is in its essence the same, differs from an ordinary\r\npneumonia at the commencement by an insidious course. The animal\r\ncommences to breathe heavily, which is distinctly visible in the heaving\r\nof the flanks, the dilatation of the nostrils, and frequently in the\r\nswaying movement of the unsteady body. The respirations increase in\r\nnumber, what little appetite remained is lost, the temperature increases\r\nfrom 1 deg. to 2 deg., the pulse becomes more rapid, and at times, for a short\r\nperiod, more tense and full, but the previous poisoning of the specific\r\ndisease has so weakened the tissues that it never becomes the\r\ncharacteristic full, tense pulse of a simple pneumonia.\r\n\r\nOn percussion of the chest dullness is found over the inflamed areas; on\r\nauscultation at the base of the neck over the trachea a tubular murmur\r\nis heard. The crepitant rales and tubular murmurs of pneumonia are heard\r\non the sides of the chest if the pneumonia is peripheral, but in\r\npneumonia complicating influenza the inflamed portions are frequently\r\ndisseminated in islands of variable size and are sometimes deep-seated,\r\nin which case the characteristic auscultory symptoms are sometimes\r\nwanting. From this time on the symptoms of the animal are those of an\r\nordinary grave pneumonia, rendered more severe by occurring in a\r\ndebilitated animal. The cough is at first hacky and aborted; later, more\r\nfull and moist. There is discharge from the nostrils, which may be\r\nmucopurulent, purulent, or hemorrhagic. As in simple pneumonia, in the\r\noutset this discharge may be \"rusty,\" owing to capillary hemorrhages. We\r\nfind that the blood is thoroughly mixed with the matter, staining it\r\nevenly, instead of being mixed with it in the form of clots. At the\r\ncommencement of the complication the animal may be subject to chills,\r\nwhich may again occur in the course of the disease, in which case, if\r\nsevere, an unfavorable termination by gangrene may be looked for. If\r\ngangrene occurs it is shown by preliminary chills, a rapid elevation of\r\ntemperature, a tumultuous heart, a flaky discharge from the nostrils,\r\nand a fetid breath; the symptoms are identical with those which occur in\r\ngangrene complicating other diseases.\r\n\r\n_Complication of the brain._--At any time during the course of the\r\ndisease congestion of the brain may occur; at an early period if the\r\nfever has been intense from the outset, but in ordinary cases more\r\nfrequently after three or four days. The animal, which has been stupid\r\nand immobile, becomes suddenly restless, walks forward in the stall\r\nuntil it fastens its head in the corner. If in a box stall and it\r\nbecomes displaced from its position, it follows the wall with the nose\r\nand eyes, rubbing it along until it reaches the corner and again fastens\r\nitself. It may become more violent and rear and plunge. If disturbed by\r\nthe entrance of the attendant or any loud noise or bright light, it will\r\nstamp with its fore feet and strike with its hind feet, but is not\r\ndefinite in fixing the object which it is resisting, which is a\r\ndiagnostic point between meningitis and rabies and which renders the\r\nanimal with the former disease less dangerous to handle. If fastened by\r\na rope to a stake or post, the animal will wander in a circle at the end\r\nof the rope. It wanders almost invariably in one direction. The pupils\r\nmay be dilated or contracted, or we may find one condition in one eye\r\nand the opposite in the other.\r\n\r\nThe period of excitement is followed by one of profound coma, in which\r\nthe animal is immobile, the head hanging and placed against the corner\r\nof the stall, the body limp, and the motion, if demanded of the animal,\r\nunsteady. Little or no attention is paid to the surrounding noises, the\r\ncrack of a whip, or even a blow on the surface of the body. The\r\nrespiration becomes slower, the pulsations are diminished, the coma\r\nlasts for variable time, to be followed by excesses of violence, after\r\nwhich the two alternate, but if severe the period of coma becomes longer\r\nand longer until the animal dies of spasms of the lungs or of heart\r\nfailure. It may die from injuries which occur in the ungovernable\r\nattacks of violence.\r\n\r\n_Complication of the feet._--The feet are the organs which are next in\r\nfrequency predisposed to congestion. This congestion takes place in the\r\nlaminae (podophyllous structures) of the feet. The stupefied animal is\r\nroused from its condition by excessive pain in the feet and assumes the\r\nposition of a foundered horse; that is, if the fore feet alone are\r\naffected, they are carried forward until they rest on the heels; and if\r\nthe hind feet are affected, all the feet are carried forward, resting on\r\ntheir heels, the hind ones as near the center of gravity as possible. In\r\nsome cases the stupor of the animal is so great that the pain is not\r\nfelt, and little or no change of the position of the animal is\r\nnoticeable. The foot is found hot to the touch, and after a given time\r\nthe depressed convex sole of typical founder is recognized.\r\n\r\n_Pleurisy._--This is a rare complication, but when it does occur it is\r\nushered in by the usual symptoms of depression, rapid pulse, small\r\nrespiration, elevation of the temperature, subcutaneous edema of the\r\nlegs and under surface of the belly, and we find a line of dullness on\r\neither side of the chest and an abscess of respiratory murmur at the\r\nlower part. If it is severe, there may be an effusion filling one-fourth\r\nto one-third of the thoracic cavity in from 36 to 48 hours.\r\n\r\n_Pericarditis_ is an occasional complication of influenza. It is ushered\r\nin by chills, elevation of the temperature; the pulse becomes rapid,\r\nthready, and imperceptible. The heart murmurs become indistinct or can\r\nnot be heard. A venous pulse is seen on the line of the jugular veins\r\nalong the neck. Respiration becomes more difficult and rapid. If the\r\nanimal is moved the symptoms become more marked or it may drop suddenly\r\ndead from heart failure.\r\n\r\n_Peritonitis_, or inflammation of the membranes lining the belly and\r\ncovering the organs contained in it, sometimes takes place. The general\r\nsymptoms are similar to those of a commencing pericarditis. The local\r\nsymptoms are those of pain, especially to pressure on side of the flanks\r\nand belly, distention of the latter, and sometimes the formation of\r\nflatus, or gas, and constipation.\r\n\r\nOther occasional complications are nephritis, hepatitis, inflammation of\r\nthe flexor tendons and rupture of them, and abscesses.\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--The diagnosis of influenza is based upon continued fever,\r\nwith great depression and symptoms of stupor and coma; the rapidly\r\ndeveloping, dark-saffron, ocher, yellowish discoloration of the mucous\r\nmembranes, swelling of the legs and soft tissues of the genitals. When\r\nthese symptoms have become manifested the diagnosis of a local\r\ncomplication is based upon the same symptoms that are produced in the\r\nlocal diseases from other causes, but in influenza the local symptoms\r\nare frequently masked or even entirely hidden by the intense stupor of\r\nthe animal, which renders it insensible to pain. The evidence of colic\r\nand congestion, which is followed by diarrhea, indicates enteritis. The\r\nrapid breathing or difficulty of respiration points to a complication of\r\nthe lungs, but, as we have seen in the study of the symptoms, the local\r\nevidences of lung lesions are frequently hidden. Again, we have seen\r\nthat inflammation of the feet, or founder, complicating influenza is\r\nfrequently not shown on account of the insensibility to pain on the part\r\nof the animal, which indicates the importance of running the hand daily\r\nover the hoofs to detect any sudden elevation of temperature on their\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of brain trouble is based upon the excessive violence\r\nwhich occurs in the course of the disease, for during the intervening\r\nperiod or coma there is no means of determining that it is due to this\r\ncomplication. Severe cases of influenza may simulate anthrax in the\r\nhorse. In both we have stupor, the intense coloration of the mucous\r\nmembranes of the eyes, and a certain amount of swelling of the legs and\r\nunder surface of the belly. The diagnosis here can be made only by\r\nmicroscopic examination of the blood. In strangles, equine variola, and\r\nscalma we have an intensely red, rosy coloration of the mucous\r\nmembranes, full, tense pulse, and although in these diseases we may have\r\ndepression, we do not have the stupor and coma except in severe cases\r\nwhich have lasted for several days. In influenza we have no evidence of\r\nthe formation of pus on the mucous membranes as in the other diseases,\r\nexcept sometimes in the conjunctivae.\r\n\r\nIn severe pneumonia (lung fever) we may find profound coma,\r\ndark-yellowish coloration of the mucous membranes, and swelling of the\r\nunder surface of the belly and legs; but in pneumonia we have the\r\nhistory of the difficulty of breathing and an acute fever of a sthenic\r\ntype from the outset, and the other symptoms do not occur for several\r\ndays, while in influenza we have the history of characteristic symptoms\r\nfor several days before the rapid breathing and difficulty of\r\nrespiration indicate the appearance of the complication. Without the\r\nhistory it is frequently difficult to diagnose a case of influenza of\r\nseveral days' standing, complicated by pneumonia, from a case of severe\r\npneumonia of five or six days' standing, but from a prognostic point of\r\nview it is immaterial, as the treatment of both are identical. The fact\r\nthat other horses in the same stable or neighborhood have influenza may\r\naid in the diagnosis.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis._--Influenza is a serious disease chiefly on account of its\r\nnumerous complications. Uncomplicated influenza is a comparatively\r\nsimple malady, and is fatal in but 1 to 5 per cent of all cases. In some\r\noutbreaks, however, complications of one kind or another preponderate;\r\nin such instances the rate of mortality is much increased.\r\n\r\n_Alterations._--The chief alteration of influenza occurs in the\r\ndigestive tract, and consists in hyperemia, infiltration, and swelling\r\nof the mucous membrane, and especially of the Peyer's patches near the\r\nileocecal valve. The tissues throughout the body are found stained, and\r\nof a more or less yellowish hue. There is always found a congested\r\ncondition of all the organs, muscles, and interstitial tissues of the\r\nbody. The coverings of the brain and spinal cord partake in the\r\ncongested and discolored condition of the rest of the tissues.\r\n\r\nOther alterations are dependent entirely upon the complications. If the\r\nlungs have been affected, we find effusions identical in their intimate\r\nnature with those of simple pneumonia, but they differ somewhat in their\r\ngeneral appearance in not being so circumscribed in their area of\r\ninvasion. The alterations of meningitis and laminitis are identical with\r\nthose of sporadic cases of founder and inflammation of the brain.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--While the appetite remains the patient should have a\r\nmoderate quantity of sound hay, good oats, and bran; or even a little\r\nfresh clover, if obtainable, can be given in small quantities. It is not\r\nso important that a special diet shall be observed as that the horse\r\nshall eat a moderate quantity of nourishing feed, and he may be tempted\r\nwith any feed of good quality that he relishes. He should be placed in a\r\nwell-ventilated box stall away from other horses. Grass, roots, apples,\r\nand milk may be offered and, if relished, allowed freely. To reduce the\r\ntemperature the safest simple plan is to inject large quantities of cold\r\nwater into the rectum. Antipyrene may be used with alcohol or strychnia.\r\nDerivatives in the form of essential oils and mustard poultices, baths\r\nof alcohol, turpentine, and hot water, after which the animal must be\r\nimmediately dried and blanketed, serve to waken the animal from the\r\nstupor and relieve the congestion of the internal organs. This treatment\r\nis especially indicated when complication by congestion of the lungs,\r\nintestines, or of the brain is threatened. Quinin and salicylic acid in\r\n1-dram doses will lower the temperature, but too continuous use of the\r\nformer in some cases increases the depression. Iodid of potash reduces\r\nthe excessive nutrition of the congested organs and thereby reduces the\r\ntemperature; again, this drug in moderate quantities is a stimulant to\r\nthe digestive tract and acts as a diuretic, causing the elimination of\r\nwaste matter by the kidneys. Small doses of Glauber's salt and\r\nbicarbonate of soda, used from the outset, stimulate the digestive tract\r\nand prevent constipation and its evil results.\r\n\r\nIn cases of severe depression and weakness of the heart digitalis can be\r\nused with advantage. At the end of the fever, and when convalescence is\r\nestablished, alcohol in one-half pint doses and good ale in 1-pint doses\r\nmay be given as stimulants. To these may be added 1-dram doses of\r\nturpentine.\r\n\r\nIn complications of the intestines camphor and asafetida are most\r\nfrequently used to relieve the pain causing the colics; diarrhea is also\r\nrelieved by the use of bicarbonate of soda, nitrate of potash, and\r\ndrinks made from boiled rice or starch, to which may be added small\r\ndoses of laudanum.\r\n\r\nIn complication of the lungs iodid of potash and digitalis are most\r\nfrequently indicated, in addition to the remedies used for the disease\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nFounder occurring as a complication of influenza is difficult to treat.\r\nIt is, unfortunately, frequently not recognized until inflammatory\r\nchanges have gone on for several days. If recognized at once, local\r\nbleeding and the use of hot or cold water, as the condition of the\r\nanimal may permit, are most useful, but in the majority of cases the\r\nstupefied animal is unable to be moved satisfactorily or to have one\r\nfoot lifted for local treatment; the only treatment consists in local\r\nbleeding above the coronary bands and the application of poultices.\r\n\r\nDuring convalescence small doses of alkalines may be kept up for a short\r\ntime, but the greatest care must be used, while furnishing the animal\r\nwith plenty of nutritious, easily digestible feed, not to over-load the\r\nintestinal tract, causing constipation and consequent diarrhea. Special\r\ncare must be taken for several weeks not to expose the animal to cold.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--In order to prevent the introduction of the disease it is\r\nadvisable to isolate newly purchased animals for at least a week.\r\nFurther, the stabling of healthy horses in sales and feed stables should\r\nalso be guarded against. At the beginning of an outbreak the disease may\r\nbe checked by immediate isolation of the affected horses, by taking the\r\ntemperatures of the healthy animals, and by the segregation of those\r\nshowing a marked elevation.\r\n\r\nBacterial vaccines are now being prepared for the prevention of this\r\ndisease and also for its cure, but to date the results are not\r\nconvincing as to the beneficial action of these products. Since the\r\ncause of the disease has not yet been satisfactorily determined it is\r\ndifficult to conceive how immunity could be produced with the aid of the\r\ngerms which enter into the preparation of these products. The reports\r\nwould indicate, however, that vaccines exert a favorable influence upon\r\nthe course of the disease, probably preventing severe complications\r\nwhich under ordinary conditions are the principal factors in determining\r\nthe severity of the outbreak.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTAGIOUS PNEUMONIA.\r\n\r\n     _Synonyms._--Edematous pneumonia; stable pneumonia; equine\r\n     pleuropneumonia; influenza pectoralis equorum; pleuropneumonia;\r\n     influenzal pneumonia; Brustseuche (German).\r\n\r\nContagious pleuropneumonia is an acute contagious disease of horses\r\nmanifesting itself either as a croupous pneumonia or a pleuropneumonia\r\nwith complications in the form of serous infiltrations of the\r\nsubcutaneous tissues and tendons.\r\n\r\n_Etiology._--Investigators of this disease incriminated various kinds of\r\nmicroorganisms as the cause of this affection. Transmission experiments\r\nwere usually negative with these organisms. This was also the case in\r\nattempts to transmit the disease by feeding with affected parts of the\r\nlungs, intestinal contents, and nasal discharge; likewise by\r\nintravenous or subcutaneous injections of blood and of emulsions made\r\nfrom nasal discharge, urine, the lung, and other organs.\r\n\r\nThe most recent experimental results of Gaffky and Lueber proved that at\r\nleast at the beginning of the disease the bronchial secretion contains\r\nthe infection. Upon killing horses affected with the typical forms of\r\nthe disease on the third or fourth day of the affection the air passages\r\nare usually found to be filled with a yellowish, tenacious, germ-free\r\nsecretion with which they succeeded in infecting healthy colts. The\r\nvirus has not been isolated. The possibility of its being a protozoan is\r\nsuggested by the above-named investigators through their observations of\r\nround or rod-shaped bodies in the round cells of the secretions.\r\n\r\nTwo organisms were formerly especially considered to play an important\r\npart in the cause of the disease, the _Streptococcus pyogenes equi_,\r\nwhich has been isolated from most cases of the disease, and the\r\n_Bacillus equisepticus_, which by some investigators was considered to\r\nbe the cause of contagious pleuropneumonia. Although there is no doubt\r\nas to the presence of these microorganisms in most of the cases, their\r\nassociation with the cause of this disease, however, is now doubted,\r\nespecially since attempts to transmit the disease with pure cultures of\r\nthese germs failed to reproduce the typical form of the disease. They,\r\nhowever, are of great significance in connection with the pathological\r\nchanges occurring in connection with the infection and probably are the\r\ndetermining factor in the course of the disease. They exert their action\r\nafter the animal has already been attacked by the true virus, and then\r\nproduce the inflammatory changes attributed to these secondary invaders.\r\n\r\nThis disease is the adynamic pneumonia of the older veterinarians, who\r\ndid not recognize any essential difference in its nature from an\r\nordinary inflammation of the lungs, except in the profound sedation of\r\nthe force of the animal affected with it, which is a prominent symptom\r\nfrom the outset of the disease. Again, this same prostration of the\r\nvital force of the animal, combined with the staggering movement and\r\nwant of coordination of the muscles, caused it for a long time to be\r\nconfounded with influenza, with which at certain periods it certainly\r\nhas a strong analogy of symptoms, but from which, as from sporadic\r\npneumonia, it can be separated very readily if the case can be followed\r\nthroughout its whole course.\r\n\r\nInfectious pneumonia is a specific inflammation of the lungs,\r\naccompanied with interstitial edema and inflammation of the tissues of\r\nthese organs and a constitutional disturbance and fever. It causes a\r\nprofound sedation of the nervous system, which may be so great as to\r\ncause death. It is sometimes attended with pleurisy, inflammation of the\r\nheart or septic complications, which also prove fatal.\r\n\r\nOld, cold, damp, foul, unclean, and badly drained and ventilated stables\r\nallow rapid dissemination of the disease to other horses in the same\r\nstable and act as rich reservoirs for preserving the contagion, which\r\nmay be retained for over a year.\r\n\r\nThe virus is but moderately volatile, and in a stable seems rather to\r\nfollow the lines of the walls and irregular courses than the direct\r\ncurrents of air and the tracts of ventilation. Prof. Dieckerhoff found\r\nthat the contagion of influenza was readily diffusible throughout an\r\nentire stable and through any opening to other buildings, but he also\r\nfound that the contagion of infectious pneumonia is not transmissible at\r\nany great distance, nor is it very diffusible in the atmosphere. A brick\r\nwall 8 feet in height served, in one instance, to prevent the infection\r\nof other animals placed on the opposite side from a horse ill with the\r\ndisease, while others placed on the same side and separated from the\r\nfocus of contagion only by open bars in the stall were infected and\r\ndeveloped the disease in its typical form.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms differ slightly from those of a frank,\r\nfibrinous pneumonia, but not so much by the introduction of new symptoms\r\nas by the want of or absence of the distinct evidences of local lesions\r\nwhich are found in the latter disease. All the pneumonias throughout the\r\nwhole course of the trouble are less marked and less clearly defined.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms may develop slowly or rapidly. If slowly, there is fever\r\nand the animal gives a rare cough which resembles that of a heavy horse\r\naffected with a slight chronic bronchitis; it becomes somewhat dejected\r\nand dull, at times somnolent, and has a diminished appetite. This\r\ncondition lasts for several days, or the disease may begin with high\r\nfever, and the symptoms described below are severe and develop in rapid\r\nsequence. The respiration increases to 24, 30, or 36 to the minute, and\r\na small, running, soft pulse attains a rhythm of 50, 70, or even more\r\nbeats in the sixty seconds. The heart, however, contrary to the\r\ndebilitated condition of the pulse, is found beating violently and\r\ntumultuously, as it does in anthrax and septic intoxication. The mucous\r\nmembranes of the eyes and mouth and of the genital organs are found\r\nsomewhat edematous, and they rapidly assume a dirty, saffron color, at\r\ntimes approaching an ocher, but distinguishable from the similar\r\ncoloration in influenza by the want of the luster belonging to the\r\nlatter and by the muddy, dull tint, which is characteristic throughout\r\nthe disease.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, without the preliminary rales which precede grave lesions of\r\nthe lungs in other diseases, the blowing murmur of pneumonia is heard\r\nover a variable area of the chest, usually, however, much more\r\ndistinctly over the trachea at the base of the neck and directly behind\r\nthe shoulder on each side of the chest. In some cases the evidence of\r\nlung lesion can be detected only over the trachea. The lesions of the\r\nlungs may be scattered throughout both lungs, involving numerous small\r\nareas, or they may be confined to and more or less fully occupy one or\r\ntwo lobes. Occasionally there is a general involvement of both lungs.\r\nThe body temperature has now reached 104 deg. or 105 deg. F., or in extreme\r\ncases even a degree higher. The debility of the animal is great without\r\nthe stupefaction or evidence of cerebral trouble, which is constant with\r\nsuch grave constitutional phenomena in influenza or severe pneumonia.\r\nThe animal is subject to occasional chills, and staggers in its gait.\r\nThe yellow coloration of the visible mucous membrane is rendered pale by\r\ninfiltration of the liquid of the blood into the tissues; the pulse may\r\nbecome so soft as to be almost imperceptible, the heart movement and\r\nsounds being at the same time exaggerated. The animal loses flesh\r\nrapidly, and dropsies of the extremities, of the under surface of the\r\nbelly, or of the internal organs may show themselves.\r\n\r\n_Terminations._--These symptoms may gradually subside after five to\r\neight days, with an improved appetite the inanition may cease and the\r\nanimal commence to nourish its impoverished blood and tissues; the pulse\r\nbecomes stronger and the heart more regular and less tumultuous; the\r\nmucous membranes assume a brighter and more distinct color; the\r\ndifficulty of respiration is removed, and the animal may make a\r\nrecovery. When death occurs it is usually directly due to heart failure;\r\nin some cases it is caused by asphyxia, owing to the great amount of\r\nexudation into the lung tissue, rendering its further function\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n_Complications._--The pulmonary complications of infectious pneumonia\r\nare secondary inflammatory or necrotic changes in the lungs themselves.\r\nSuppuration at times takes place in the bronchi and may extend to the\r\nlung tissue. In this case mucous rales develop which are most distinctly\r\nheard over the trachea and on the sides of the chest directly behind the\r\nshoulders. With the development of the mucous rales, to be heard on\r\nauscultation, we have a more purulent discharge from the nostrils,\r\nsimilar to that of a chronic or subacute bronchitis. If the inflammation\r\nhas been of some standing, cavernous rales may be heard, indicating the\r\ndestruction of a considerable portion of lung tissue and the formation\r\nof a cavity. The effects of this more acute inflammatory process are not\r\nappreciable in the general condition of the animal, except to weaken it\r\nstill further and add to its debilitated and emaciated cachexia.\r\nGangrene sometimes occurs. A sudden rise of the body temperature of 1 deg.\r\nor 2 deg., with a more enfeebled pulse and a still more tumultous heart,\r\ndevelop simultaneously with the appearance of a discharge from the\r\nnostrils. This discharge is gray in color, serous or watery in\r\nconsistency, mixed with the detritus of broken-down lung tissue, and\r\nsometimes contains clots of blood, or in more serious cases may be\r\nmarked by a quantity of fluid blood from a hemorrhage, which proves\r\nfatal. The discharge is fetid to the smell. The animal emaciates\r\nrapidly. On examination of the lungs mucous rales are heard in the\r\nlarger bronchi, cavities may be found at any part of these organs, and\r\npoints of lobular pneumonia may be detected.\r\n\r\nA very serious complication is an inflammation of the heart muscle. This\r\nis shown by a very weak and rapid pulse, great prostration, some filling\r\nof the lungs. This complication nearly always terminates in death. Other\r\ncomplications which may be mentioned are inflammation of the kidneys,\r\nblood poisoning, congestion of the brain, and inflammation of the\r\ntendinous sheaths and the tendons of the legs.\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--As fever is the first symptom of infectious pneumonia, it\r\nis useful during an outbreak of this disease to make daily temperature\r\nmeasurements of the exposed horses, so that the first indication of\r\ndisease may be discovered and the horse removed from contact with those\r\nthat are sound.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis._--The mortality in this disease may be as high as 25 per\r\ncent, but it is usually not more than 10 per cent. If there is a special\r\ntendency to complications of some sort, the mortality is increased.\r\n\r\n_Alterations._--At the time of death from infectious pneumonia we\r\nfrequently find septic changes and the evidences of putrefaction. The\r\nsolidification of the lung tissue is found irregular in shape and high\r\naround the root of the lungs and the large bronchi, and is generally\r\ncovered by sound lung tissue. The anterior lobes of the lungs are\r\nusually entirely affected. The diseased portion appears of a\r\ngray-yellowish color, somewhat watery, and tears readily. Matter is\r\nfound in the air tubes which form gutters through the jellylike mass of\r\nthe diseased lung. Abscesses from the size of a nut to larger masses may\r\nbe found throughout the lungs. The blood is dark in color, fluid, or\r\nonly clotted into soft, jellylike masses. Masses of gangrenous or\r\ndead-black tissue may be present.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Bleeding is not to be used, because it would only still\r\nfurther weaken an already enfeebled animal; antimony or the alterants\r\nwould increase the depression of a too-depraved constitution. There is\r\nin this disease no acute congestion of a particular organ to draw off by\r\ndepletive measures, nor any violent blood current to be retarded, for\r\nfear of hypernutrition of any special part.\r\n\r\nRevulsives do good, as they excite the nervous system and awaken the\r\ntorpor of the weakened blood vessels, which aid in the reestablishment\r\nof the functions. As in other diseases, mustard poultices may be applied\r\nover the belly and sides of the chest, but caution must be used in the\r\nemployment of blisters, as ugly ulcers may result from their action on a\r\ntissue of weakened vitality. Setons are dangerous from the great\r\ntendency in this disease to septic complications. Repeated friction of\r\nthe legs by hand-rubbing and warmth by bandaging and by rubbing the\r\nsurface of the body with turpentine and alcohol, which is immediately to\r\nbe dried by rough towels, will excite the circulation and stimulate the\r\nemunctories of the skin.\r\n\r\nStimulants are given internally from the outset of the disease.\r\nTurpentine in 1-dram doses regulates the heart and excites the kidneys\r\nto carry off waste matter, but if repeated too frequently may disturb\r\nthe already delicate digestive system. Alcohol rectifies the latter\r\ndanger, and is a useful stimulant to the heart and digestive system, if\r\ngiven with care in small doses. It is an antiputrid, and is especially\r\nindicated when septic complications and gangrene are present. The\r\naromatics and bitter tonics are useful; gentian and tea in warm\r\ndecoction form a useful menstruum for other remedies. Digitalis is a\r\nuseful remedy. Strychnin and quinin may be given throughout almost the\r\nwhole course of the disease. The various preparations of iron are\r\nastringents and excitants to the digestive system. Carbolic acid is an\r\nantiputrid which is of marked benefit in edematous pneumonia; it should\r\nbe given in small doses diluted in alcohol.\r\n\r\nSalicylic acid may be given in 1 or 2 dram doses every few hours. It is\r\nmuch used for troubles of the serous membranes, lowers the temperature,\r\nand is of value in this disease in preventing the exudation into the\r\ntissue of the lungs. The alkalines, as the sulphate and bicarbonate of\r\nsoda, the nitrate of potash, and very small doses of the iodid of\r\npotash, should be employed to regulate the digestive tract, the kidneys,\r\nand the other excreting glands, and to stimulate absorption of the waste\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThe biological products enumerated under the treatment of the catarrhal\r\nform of influenza are also recommended for this disease. The bacterial\r\nvaccines in particular are being employed to a great extent, but the\r\nresults are not uniformly satisfactory, especially with regard to\r\nprevention. They might, however, exert a beneficial influence against an\r\nattack of the secondary invaders and complications. A serum is also\r\nbeing prepared especially for the treatment of this disease, and since\r\nthis is obtained from animals which have been highly immunized against\r\nthe various organisms found in association with influenza it no doubt is\r\nbeneficial, especially when the life of the animal is threatened. Such\r\nserum, however, should be used in sufficiently large doses, as repeated\r\nexperience has proved that small doses have no beneficial action on the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nMore recently salvarsan is being highly recommended for the treatment of\r\nthe pneumonic form of influenza, and by many investigators it is\r\nconsidered as a specific for this affection. A single injection of this\r\npreparation is supposed to result in a rapid clearing of the lungs and\r\nthe recovery of the animal is hastened. The cost of this product,\r\nhowever, at the present time, is exorbitant, and it should be considered\r\nonly in the treatment of very valuable animals.\r\n\r\nThe same procedure as given for influenza should be carried out in the\r\nprevention of this affection.\r\n\r\nThe diet demands the strictest attention from the outset. In many of the\r\nfevers the feed has to be diminished in quantity and regulated in the\r\nquality of its heat-producing components during the acute part of the\r\ndisease, so as to lessen the material for combustion in the inflamed\r\norgans. In edematous pneumonia, on the contrary, all the feed that can\r\npossibly be digested and assimilated must be given. Choice must be made\r\nof the richest material which can be handled by the weakened stomach and\r\nintestines without fatiguing them. Good, sound hay should be chopped\r\nshort and dampened or partly boiled; in the latter case the hay tea can\r\nbe reserved to use as a drink. Oats may be preferred dry or in other\r\ncases are taken better scalded; in most cases, however, it is better to\r\ngive slops of oatmeal, to which may be added a little bran, barley\r\nflour, or boiled milk and wheat flour. Pure cow's milk, not too rich in\r\nfatty matter, may be given alone or with beaten eggs; frequently the\r\nhorse has to be coaxed with the milk diluted with several parts of water\r\nat first, but will soon learn to drink the pure milk. Apples and carrots\r\ncut up raw or boiled are useful, and fresh clover in small quantities\r\nwill frequently stimulate the appetite. In other words, various feeds\r\nand combinations should be given to the horse. Throughout the course of\r\nthe disease and during convalescence the greatest attention must be\r\ntaken to cleaning the coat thoroughly so as to keep the glands of the\r\nskin in working order, and light, warm covering must be used to protect\r\nthe animal from cold or drafts of air.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRANGLES.\r\n\r\n     _Synonyms._--Distemper; colt-ill; catarrhal fever; one form of\r\n     shipping fever; febris pyogenica.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Strangles is an infectious disease of the horse, mule,\r\nand ass, seen most frequently in young animals, and usually leaving them\r\nimmune from future trouble of the same kind.\r\n\r\nIt appears as a fever lasting for a few days, and is usually associated\r\nwith an abscess formation of lymph glands, especially those under the\r\njaw, which have a tendency to break on the outside. It usually leaves\r\nthe animal after convalescence perfectly healthy and as good as it was\r\nbefore, but sometimes leaves it a roarer or is followed by the\r\ndevelopment of deep-seated abscesses which may prove fatal.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--The cause of strangles is infection by direct contact with an\r\nanimal suffering from the disease, or indirectly through contact with\r\nthe discharges from an infected animal, or by means of the atmosphere in\r\nwhich an infected animal has been. There are many predisposing causes\r\nwhich render some animals much more subject to contract the disease than\r\nothers. Early age, which has given it the popular name of colt-ill,\r\noffers many more subjects than the later periods of life do, for the\r\nanimal can contract the disease but once, and the large majority of\r\nadult and old animals have derived an immunity from previous attacks. At\r\n3, 4, or 5 years of age the colt, which has been at home, safe on a\r\nmeadow or in a cozy barnyard, far from all intercourse with other\r\nanimals or sources of contagion, is first put to work and driven to the\r\nmarket town or county fairs to be exposed to an atmosphere or to stables\r\ncontaminated by other horses suffering from disease and serving as\r\ninfecting agents. If it fails to contract it there, it is sold and\r\nshipped in foul, undisinfected railway cars to dealers' stables, equally\r\nunclean, where it meets many opportunities of infection. If it escapes\r\nso far, it reaches the time for heavier work and daily contact on the\r\nstreets of towns or large cities, with numerous other horses and mules,\r\nsome of which are sure to be the bearers of the germs of this or some\r\nother infectious disease, and at last it succumbs.\r\n\r\nThe period of the eruption of the last permanent teeth, or the end of\r\nthe period of development from the colt to an adult horse, at which time\r\nthe animals usually have a tendency to fatten and be excessively\r\nfull-blooded, also seems to be a predisposing period for the contraction\r\nof this as well as of the other infectious diseases. Thoroughbred colts\r\nare very susceptible, and frequently contract strangles at a somewhat\r\nearlier age than those of more humble origin. Mules and asses are much\r\nless susceptible and are but rarely affected. Other animals are not\r\nsubject to this disease, but there is a certain analogy between it and\r\ndistemper in dogs. After exposure to infection there is a period of\r\nincubation of the disease, lasting from two to four days, during which\r\nthe animal enjoys its ordinary health.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The horse at first is a little sluggish if used, or when\r\nplaced in its stable is somewhat dejected, paying but moderate attention\r\nto the various disturbing surroundings. Its appetite is somewhat\r\ndiminished in many cases, while in some cases the animal eats well\r\nthroughout. Thirst is increased, but not a great deal of water is taken\r\nat one time. If a bucket of water is placed in the manger the patient\r\nwill dip its nose into it and swallow a few mouthfuls, allowing some of\r\nit to drip back and then stop, to return to it in a short time. The coat\r\nbecomes dry and the hairs stand on end. At times the horse will have\r\nchills of one or the other leg, the fore quarters, or hind quarters, or\r\nin severe cases of the whole body, with trembling of the muscles and\r\ndryness of the skin.\r\n\r\nIf the eyes and mouth are examined the membranes are found reddened to a\r\nbright rosy color. The pulse is quickened and the breathing may be\r\nslightly accelerated. At the end of two days a cough is heard and a\r\ndischarge begins to come from the nostrils. This discharge is at first\r\nwatery; it then becomes thicker, somewhat bluish in color, and sticky,\r\nand finally it assumes the yellowish color of matter and increases\r\ngreatly in quantity.\r\n\r\nAt the outset the colt may sneeze occasionally and a cough is heard. The\r\ncough is at first repeated and harsh, but soon becomes softer and moist\r\nas the discharge increases. Again, the cough varies according to the\r\nsource of the discharge, for in light cases this may be only a catarrh\r\nof the nasal canals, or it may be from the throat, the windpipe, or the\r\nair tubes of the lungs, or even from the lungs themselves. According to\r\nthe organ affected the symptoms and character of cough are similar to\r\nthose of a laryngitis, bronchitis, or lung fever caused by ordinary\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nShortly after the discharge is seen a swelling takes place under the\r\njaw, or in the intermaxillary space. This is at first puffy, somewhat\r\nhot and tender, and finally becomes distinctly so, and an abscess is\r\nfelt, or having broken itself the discharge is seen dripping from a\r\nsmall opening. When the discharge from the nostrils has fully developed\r\nthe fever usually disappears and the animal regains its appetite, unless\r\nthe swelling is sufficient to interfere with the function of the throat,\r\ncausing pain on any attempt to swallow. At the end of four or six days\r\nthe discharge lessens, the soreness around the throat diminishes, the\r\nhorse regains its appetite, and in two weeks has regained its usual\r\ncondition. Old and strong horses may have the disease in so light a form\r\nthat the fever is not noticeable; they may continue to eat and perform\r\ntheir ordinary work as usual and no symptom may be seen beyond a slight\r\ndischarge from the nose and a rare cough, which is not sufficient to\r\nworry any but the most particular owner. But, on the other hand, the\r\ndisease may assume a malignant form or become complicated so as to\r\nbecome a most serious disease, and even prove fatal in many cases.\r\nInflammation of the larynx and bronchi, if excessive, produce violent,\r\nharsh coughing, which may almost asphyxiate the animal. The large amount\r\nof discharge may be mixed with air by the difficult breathing, and the\r\nnostrils, the front of the animal, manger, and surrounding objects\r\nbecome covered with a white foam. The inflammation may be in the lung\r\nitself (lobular pneumonia) and cause the animal to breathe heavily,\r\nheave at the flanks, and show great distress. In this condition marked\r\nsymptoms of fever are seen, the appetite is lost, the coat is dry, the\r\nhorse stands back in its stall at the end of the halter strap with its\r\nneck extended and its legs propped apart to favor breathing. This\r\ncondition may end by resolution, leaving the horse for some time with a\r\nsevere cough, or the animal may die from choking up of the lungs\r\n(asphyxia).\r\n\r\nThe swelling under the jaw may be excessive, and if the abscess is not\r\nopened it burrows toward the throat or to the side and causes\r\ninflammation of the parotid glands and breaks in annoying fistulas at\r\nthe sides of the throat and even up as high as the ears. Roaring may\r\noccur either during a moderately severe attack from inflammation of the\r\nthroat (larynx), or at a later period as the result of continued lung\r\ntrouble. Abscesses may develop in other parts of the body, in the poll,\r\nin the withers, or in the spaces of loose tissue under the arms, in the\r\nfold of the thigh, and, in entire horses, in the testicles.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the disease, or later, when the animal seems to be\r\non the road to perfect recovery, abscesses may form in the internal\r\norgans and produce symptoms characteristic of disease of those parts.\r\n\r\nRoaring, plunging, wandering in a circle, or standing with the head\r\nwedged in a corner of the stall indicate the collection of matter in the\r\nbrain. Sudden and severe lung symptoms, without previous discharge,\r\npoint to an abscess between the lungs, in the mediastinum; colic, which\r\nis often continuous for days, is the result of the formation of an\r\nabscess in some part of the abdominal cavity, usually in the mesentery.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._--The lesions of strangles are found on the surface of the\r\nmucous membranes, essentially of the respiratory system, and in the\r\nloose connective tissue fibers of the internal organs and glands, and\r\nconsist of acute inflammatory changes, tending to the formation of\r\nmatter. The blood is unaltered, though it is rich in fibrin, and if the\r\nanimal has died of asphyxia it is found dark colored and uncoagulated\r\nwhen the body is first opened. If the animal has died while suffering\r\nfrom high fever the ordinary alterations throughout the body, which are\r\nproduced by any fever not attended by alteration of blood, are found.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--Healthy horses should be separated from the infected\r\nanimals, and the stables in which the disease has occurred should be\r\nthoroughly disinfected. Since the disease frequently occurs annually on\r\ninfected premises, systematic disinfection should be practiced after an\r\noutbreak. The stables, as well as all utensils which might have come in\r\ncontact with the infection, should be thoroughly disinfected. By such\r\npractices recurrences of the disease may be prevented.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Ordinary light cases require but little treatment beyond\r\ndiet, warm washes, moistened hay, warm coverings, and protection from\r\nexposure to cold. The latter is urgently called for, as lung\r\ncomplications, severe bronchitis, and laryngitis are often the results\r\nof neglect of this precaution. If the fever is excessive, the horse may\r\nreceive small quantities of Glauber's salt (handful three times a day)\r\nas a laxative, bicarbonate of soda or niter in one-dram doses every few\r\nhours, and small doses of antimony, iodid of potash, aconite, or quinin.\r\nSteaming the head with the vapor of warm water poured over a bucket of\r\nbran and hay, in which belladonna leaves or tar have been placed, will\r\nallay the inflammation of the mucous membranes and greatly ease the\r\ncough.\r\n\r\nThe swelling of the glands should be promptly treated by flaxseed\r\npoultices and bathing with warm water, and as soon as there is any\r\nevidence of the formation of matter it should be opened. Prompt action\r\nin this will often save serious complications. Blisters and irritating\r\nliniments should _not_ be applied to the throat. When lung complications\r\nshow themselves the horse should have mustard applied to the belly and\r\nto the sides of the chest. When convalescence begins great care must be\r\ntaken not to expose the animal to cold, which may bring on relapses, and\r\nwhile exercise is of great advantage it must not be turned into work\r\nuntil the animal has entirely regained its strength.\r\n\r\nBacterial vaccines are now being extensively used for the prevention and\r\ntreatment of this disease. They are prepared from the specific germ of\r\nthe disease and frequently exert a very beneficial influence. A serum is\r\nalso being prepared from horses, which is injected with gradually\r\nincreasing doses of this germ. This serum possesses considerable\r\ncurative value and may prove especially valuable in cases in which the\r\nanimals have failed to respond to other forms of treatment, or when\r\nvaluable animals are affected with the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nPURPURA HEMORRHAGICA.\r\n\r\n     _Synonyms._--Anasarca; petechial fever; morbus maculosus.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--This disease is a septic bacterial intoxication, acute\r\nand infectious in character, and is manifested by edematous swellings of\r\nthe subcutaneous connective tissue, and hemorrhages on the mucous\r\nmembrane and in the internal organs.\r\n\r\nA previous attack of influenza is a common predisposing cause of this\r\ndisease, which appears most frequently a few weeks after convalescence\r\nis established. It occurs more frequently in those animals which have\r\nmade a rapid convalescence and are apparently perfectly well than it\r\ndoes in those which have made a slower recovery.\r\n\r\nAnasarca commences by symptoms which are excessively variable. The local\r\nlesions may be confined to a small portion of the animal's body and the\r\nconstitutional phenomena be nil. The appearance and gravity of the local\r\nlesions may be so unlike, from difference of location, that they seem to\r\nbelong to a separate disease, and complications may completely mask the\r\noriginal trouble.\r\n\r\nIn the simplest form the first symptom noticed is a swelling, or several\r\nswellings, occurring on the surface of the body--on the forearm, the\r\nleg, the under surface of the belly, or the side of the head. The\r\ntumefaction is at first the size of a hen's egg; not hot, little\r\nsensitive, and distinctly circumscribed by a marked line from the\r\nsurrounding healthy tissue. These tumors gradually extend until they\r\ncoalesce, and in a few hours we have swelling of the legs, legs and\r\nbelly, or the head, to an enormous size; they have always the\r\ncharacteristic constricted border, which looks as if it had been tied\r\nwith a cord. In the nostrils are found small reddish spots, or petechiae,\r\nwhich gradually assume a brownish and frequently a black color.\r\nExamination of the mouth will frequently reveal similar lesions on the\r\nsurface of the tongue, along the lingual gutter, and on the fraenum. If\r\nthe external swelling has been on the head, the petechiae of the mucous\r\nmembranes are liable to be more numerous and to coalesce into patches of\r\nlarger size than when the dropsy is confined to the legs. The animal may\r\nbe rendered stiff by the swelling of the legs, or be annoyed by an\r\nawkward swollen head, which at times may be so enormous as to resemble\r\nthat of a hippopotamus rather than that of a horse. During this period\r\nthe temperature remains normal; the pulse, if altered at all, is only a\r\nlittle weaker; the respiration is only hurried if the swelling of the\r\nhead infringes on the caliber of the nostrils. The appetite remains\r\nnormal. The animal is attentive to all that is going on, and, except for\r\nthe swelling, apparently in perfect health.\r\n\r\nIn from two to four days, in severe cases, the tissues can no longer\r\nresist the pressure of the exuded fluid. Over the surface of the skin\r\nwhich covers the dropsy we find a slight serous sweating, which loosens\r\nthe epidermis and dries so as to simulate the eruption of some cutaneous\r\ndisease. If this is excessive we may see irritated spots which are\r\nsuppurating. In the nasal fossae the hemorrhagic spots have acted as\r\nirritants, and, inviting an increased amount of blood to the\r\nSchneiderian membrane, produce a coryza or even a catarrh. We may now\r\nfind some enlargement and peripheral edema of the lymphatic glands,\r\nwhich are fed from the affected part. The thermometer indicates a slight\r\nrise in the body temperature, while the pulse and respiration are\r\nsomewhat accelerated. The appetite usually remains good. In the course\r\nof a few days the temperature may have reached 102 deg., 103 deg., or 104 deg. F.\r\n\r\nFever is established, not an essential or specific fever in any way, but\r\na simple secondary fever produced by the dead material from the surface\r\nor superficial suppuration, and by the oxidization and absorption of the\r\ncolloid mass contained in the tissues. The skin may suppurate or slough\r\nmore or less over the areas of greatest tension or where it is irritated\r\nby blows or pressure. The great swelling about the head may by closure\r\nof the nostrils interfere seriously with breathing. Internal edema may\r\noccur in the throat, lungs, or intestines. Septicemia, or blood\r\npoisoning, may result from anasarca.\r\n\r\n_Terminations._--The simple form of the disease most frequently\r\nterminates favorably on the eighth or tenth day by resolution or\r\nabsorption of the effusion, with usually a profuse diuresis, and with or\r\nwithout diarrhea. The appetite remains good or is at times capricious.\r\n\r\nDeath may occur from mechanical asphyxia, produced by closure of the\r\nnostrils or closure of the glottis. Metastasis to the lungs is almost\r\ninvariably fatal, causing death by asphyxia, Metastasis to the\r\nintestines may cause death from pain, enteritis, or hemorrhage.\r\n\r\nExcessive suppuration, lymphangitis, and gangrene are causes of a fatal\r\ntermination by exhaustion. Mortal exhaustion is again produced by\r\ninability to swallow in cases of excessive swelling of the head.\r\n\r\nPeritonitis may arise secondary to the enteric edema, or by perforation\r\nof the stomach or intestines by a gangrenous spot. Septicemia terminates\r\nfatally with its usual train of symptoms.\r\n\r\n_Alterations._--The essential alterations of anasarca are exceedingly\r\nsimple; the capillaries are dilated, the lymphatic spaces between the\r\nfibers of the connective tissue are filled with serum, and the\r\ncoagulable portion of the blood presents a yellowish or citrine mass,\r\njellylike in consistency, which has stretched out the tissue like the\r\nmeshes of a sponge. Where the effusion has occurred between the muscles,\r\nas in the head, these are found dissected and separated from each other\r\nlike those of a hog's head by the masses of fat. The surface of the skin\r\nis desquamated and frequently denuded of the hair. Frequently there are\r\ntraces of suppuration and of ulceration. The mucous membrane of the nose\r\nis found studded with small, hemorrhagic spots, sometimes red, more\r\nfrequently brown or black, often coalesced with each other in\r\nirregular-sized patches and surrounded by a reddish zone, the product of\r\nirritation. If edema of the intestines has occurred, the membrane is\r\nfound four or five times its normal thickness, reddish in color, with\r\nhemorrhages on the free surface. Edema of the lungs leaves these organs\r\ndistended. The secondary alterations vary according to the\r\ncomplications. There are frequently the lesions of asphyxia; externally\r\nwe find ulcers, abscesses, and gangrenous spots and the deep ulcers\r\nresulting from the latter. The lymphatic cords and glands are found with\r\nall the lesions of lymphangitis. Again are found the traces of excessive\r\nemaciation, or the lesions of septicemia. Except from the complications\r\nthe blood is not altered in anasarca.\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--The diagnosis of anasarca must principally be made from\r\nfarcy or glanders. In anasarca the swelling is nonsensitive, while\r\nsensitive in the acute swelling of farcy. The nodes of farcy are\r\ndistinct and hard and never circumscribed, as in the other disease. The\r\neruption of glanders on the mucous membranes is nodular, hard, and\r\npelletlike. The redness disappears on pressure. In case of excessive\r\nswelling of the head in anasarca, there may occur an extensive\r\nsero-fibrinous exudation from the mucous membranes of the nose, poured\r\nout as a semifluid mass or as a cast of the nasal fossae, never having\r\nthe appearance or typical oily character which it has in glanders. The\r\ninflammation of the lymphatic cords and glands in anasarca does not\r\nproduce the indurated character which is found in farcy.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis._--While anasarca is not an excessively fatal disease, the\r\nprognosis must always be guarded. The majority of cases run a simple\r\ncourse and terminate favorably at the end of 8 or 10 days, or possibly,\r\nafter one to two relapses, requiring several weeks for complete\r\nrecovery. Effusion into the head renders the prognosis much more grave\r\nfrom the possible danger of mechanical asphyxia. Threatened mechanical\r\nasphyxia is especially dangerous on account of the risk of blood\r\npoisoning after an operation of tracheotomy. Edema of the viscera is a\r\nmost serious complication. The prognosis is based on the complications,\r\ntheir extent, and their individual gravity, existing, as they do here,\r\nin an already debilitated subject.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment of anasarca may be as variable as are the\r\nlesions. The indications are at once shown by the alterations and\r\nmechanism of the disease, which we have just studied.\r\n\r\nHygiene comes into play as the most important factor. Oats, oat-and-hay\r\ntea, milk, eggs--anything which the stomach or rectum can be coaxed to\r\ntake care of--must be employed to give the nutriment, which is the only\r\nthing that will permanently strengthen the tissues; they must be\r\nstrengthened in order to keep the capillaries at their proper caliber.\r\n\r\nLaxatives, diaphoretics, and diuretics must be used to stimulate the\r\nemunctories so that they may carry off the large amount of the products\r\nof decomposition which result from the stagnated effusions of anasarca.\r\nOf these the sulphate of soda in small, repeated doses, the nitrate of\r\npotash and bicarbonate of soda in small quantity, or the chlorate of\r\npotash in single large doses will be found useful. Williams cites the\r\nchlorate of potash as an antiputrid. Stimulants and astringents are\r\ndirectly indicated. Spirits of turpentine serves the double purpose of a\r\ncardiac stimulant and a powerful, warm diuretic, for the kidneys in this\r\ndisease will stand a wonderful amount of work. Camphor can be used with\r\nadvantage. Coffee and tea are two of the diffusible stimulants which are\r\ntoo much neglected in veterinary medicine; both are valuable adjuncts in\r\ntreatment of anasarca, as they are during convalescence at the end of\r\nany grave disease which has tended to render the patient anemic. Dilute\r\nsulphuric and hydrochloric acids are, perhaps, the best examples of a\r\ncombination of stimulant, astringent, and tonic which can be employed.\r\nThe simple astringents of mineral origin, sulphates of iron, copper,\r\netc., are useful as digestive tonics; I doubt whether they have any\r\nconstitutional effect. The vegetable astringents, tannic acid, etc.,\r\nhave not proved efficacious in my hands. Iodid of potash in small doses\r\nserves the triple purpose of digestive tonic, denutritive for\r\ninflammation, and diuretic. Among the newer forms of treatment are\r\ndiluted Lugol's solution injected into the trachea, anti-streptococcus\r\nserum and colloidal silver solution injected into the circulation. No\r\none but a qualified veterinarian would be competent to apply these\r\nremedies.\r\n\r\n_Externally._--Sponging the swollen parts, especially the head, when the\r\nswelling occurs there, is most useful. The bath should be at an extreme\r\nof temperature--either ice cold to constrict the tissues or hot water to\r\nact as an emollient and to favor circulation. Vinegar may be added as an\r\nastringent. When we have excessively denuded surfaces, suppuration, or\r\nopen wounds, disinfectants should be added to the wash.\r\n\r\nIn cases of excessive swelling, especially of the head, mechanical\r\nrelief may be required. Even in country practice, punctures of the part\r\nshould be made with the hot iron, as no other disease so predisposes to\r\nseptic contamination. When mechanical asphyxia is threatened tracheotomy\r\nmay be demanded. With the first evidence of dyspnea, not due to closing\r\nof the nostrils or glottis, or with the first pawing which gives rise to\r\na suspicion of colic, a mustard plaster should be applied over the whole\r\nbelly and chest. The sinapism will draw the current of the circulation\r\nto the exterior, the metastasis to the lungs or intestines is prevented,\r\nand the enfeebled nervous system is stimulated to renewed vigor by the\r\nperipheral irritation. The organs are encouraged by it to renewed\r\nfunctional activity; the local inflammation produced by it favors\r\nabsorption of the exudation. The objection to the use of blisters is\r\ntheir more severe action and the danger of mortification. Septicemia,\r\nwhen occurring as a complication, requires the ordinary treatment for\r\nthe putrid diseases, with little hope of a good result.\r\n\r\nAfter recovery the animal regains its ordinary health, and there is no\r\npredisposition to a return of the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORSEPOX, OR EQUINE VARIOLA.\r\n\r\n     _Synonyms._--Variola equina; pustular grease; phlyctenold\r\n     herpes.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Horsepox is a specific, infectious fever of the horse,\r\nattended by an eruption of pustules, or pocks, over any part of the skin\r\nor on the mucous membranes lining the various cavities in the body, but\r\nchiefly, and often exclusively, upon the pasterns and fetlocks. The\r\neruption may commence upon the lips, or about the nostrils or eyes.\r\n\r\nThis disease was described by the early Roman agricultural writers and\r\nby the veterinarians of the eighteenth century. It received its first\r\nimportant notice from the great Jenner, who confounded it with grease in\r\nhorses, since animals with this disease are very liable to have the\r\neruption of variola appear on the fetlocks. He saw these cases transmit\r\nthe disease to cattle in the byres and to the stablemen and milkmaids\r\nwho attended them, and furnish the latter with immunity from smallpox,\r\nwhich led to the discovery of vaccination. Horsepox is also frequently\r\nmistaken for the exanthemata attending some forms of venereal disease in\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\nVariola in the horse, while it is identical in principle, general\r\ncourse, complications, and lesions with variola in other animals, is a\r\ndisease of the horse itself, and is not transmissible in the form of\r\nvariola to any other animal; nor is the variola of any other animal\r\ntransmissible to the horse. Cattle and men, if inoculated from a case of\r\nhorsepox, develop vaccinia, but vaccinia from the latter animals is not\r\nso readily reinoculated into the horse with success. If it does develop,\r\nit produces the original disease.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--The direct cause of horsepox is infection. A large number of\r\npredisposing causes favor the development of the disease, as in the case\r\nof strangles, and this trouble, like almost all contagious diseases,\r\nrenders the animal which has had one attack immune. The chief\r\npredisposing cause is youthfulness. Old horses which have not been\r\naffected are less liable to become infected when exposed than younger\r\nones. The exposure incident to shipment, through public stables, cars,\r\netc., acts as a predisposing cause, as in the other infectious diseases.\r\nThe period of final dentition is a time which renders it peculiarly\r\nsusceptible.\r\n\r\nDupaul states that the infection is transmissible through the atmosphere\r\nfor several hundred yards. The more common means of contagion is by\r\ndirect contact or by means of fomites. Feed boxes and bridles previously\r\nused by horses affected with variola are probably the most frequent\r\ncarriers of the virus, and we find the lesions in the majority of cases\r\ndeveloped in the neighborhood of the lips and nostrils. Coition is a\r\nfrequent cause. A stallion suffering from this disease may be the cause\r\nof a considerable epizootic, as he transmits it to a number of brood\r\nmares and they in turn return to the farms where they are surrounded by\r\nyoung animals to which they convey the contagion. The saddle and croup\r\nstraps are frequent agents of infection. The presence of a wound greatly\r\nfavors the inoculation of the disease, which is also sometimes carried\r\nby surgical instruments or sponges. Trasbot recites a case in which a\r\nset of hobbles, which had been used on an animal suffering from\r\nvariola, were used on a horse for a quittor operation and transmitted\r\nthe disease, which developed on the edges of the wound.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--There is a period of incubation, after an animal has been\r\nexposed, of from five to eight days, during which there is no\r\nappreciable alteration in the health. This period is shorter in summer\r\nthan in winter. At the end of this time small nodes develop at the point\r\nof inoculation and the animal becomes feverish. The horse is dull and\r\ndejected, loses its appetite, and has a rough, dry coat with the hairs\r\non end. There is moderate thirst. The respirations are somewhat\r\nquickened and the pulse becomes rapid and full. The body temperature is\r\nelevated, frequently reaching 104 deg. or 105 deg. F. within 36 or 48 hours from\r\nthe appearance of the first symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe visible mucous membranes, especially the conjunctivae, are of a\r\nbright rosy red. In the lymphatic, cold-blooded, and more common horses\r\nthese symptoms of fever are less marked; even with a comparatively high\r\ntemperature the animal may retain its appetite and work comparatively\r\nwell, but these cases, if worked and overheated, are liable to develop\r\nserious complications.\r\n\r\nAt the end of from three and a half to four days the eruption breaks\r\nout, the fever abates, and the general symptoms improve. The eruption in\r\nsevere cases may be generalized; it may be confined to the softer skin\r\nof the nose and lips, the genital organs, and the inside of the thighs,\r\nor it may be localized in the neighborhood of a wound or in the\r\nirritated skin of a pair of greasy heels. It consists of a varying\r\nnumber of little nodes which, on a mucous membrane, as in the nostrils\r\nor vagina, or on soft, unpigmented skin, appear red and feel at first\r\nlike shot under the epidermis. These nodes soften and show a yellowish\r\nspot in the center when they become pustules. The epidermis is dissolved\r\nand the matter escapes as a viscid fluid at first citrine and later\r\ncloudy and purulent, which dries rapidly, forming scabs; if these fall\r\noff or are removed they leave a little shallow, concave ulcer which\r\nheals in the course of five or six days. In the softer skin if pigmented\r\nthe cicatrices are white and frequently remain so for about a year, when\r\nthe pigment returns. The lips or genital organs of a colored horse, if\r\ncovered with a number of small white spots about the size of a pea, will\r\nusually indicate that the animal has been affected with the horsepox.\r\n\r\nAt times the pustules may become confluent and produce large,\r\nsuperficial, serpentine ulcers on the membrane of the nostrils, around\r\nthe lips or eyelids, or on the borders of wounds and in greasy heels; in\r\nthis case the part becomes swollen, hot, painful, and is covered with a\r\nprofuse discharge of matter. In this form there is frequently a\r\nsecondary fever lasting for a day or two.\r\n\r\nIn severe cases there may be a suppurative adenitis, or inflammation of\r\nthe lymphatic glands which are fed from the affected part. If the\r\neruption is around the nostrils and lips, the glands between the jaws\r\n(submaxillary) form abscesses as in a case of strangles; if the eruption\r\nis in a pair of greasy heels abscesses may form in the fold of the groin\r\n(inguinal). There may be so much tumefaction of the nostrils as to\r\nproduce difficulty in breathing.\r\n\r\n_Complications._--A case of horsepox may be attended with various\r\ncomplications of varying degrees of importance. Adenitis, or suppuration\r\nof the glands, has just been mentioned. Confluent eruptions irritate the\r\npart and induce the animal to rub the inflamed part against the manger\r\nor scratch it in other ways and thus produce troublesome ulcers, which\r\nmay leave ugly scars. Irritation of the mucous membrane of the nose\r\ncauses severe coryza with purulent discharge.\r\n\r\nThe eruption may occur in the throat or in the air tubes to the lungs,\r\ndeveloping an acute laryngitis or bronchitis. If the animal is exposed\r\nto cold, or worked so as to engorge the lungs with blood at the\r\ntermination of the specific fever, just when the eruption is about to\r\nlocalize, it may be determined to the lungs. In this case we have a\r\nshort, dry cough, labored breathing, the development of a secondary\r\nfever of some gravity, and all the external symptoms of a pneumonia.\r\nThis pneumonia differs, however, from an ordinary pneumonia in the\r\nsymptoms furnished by the examination of the lungs themselves. In place\r\nof a large mass of the lung tissue being affected the inflammation is\r\ndisseminated in smaller spots over the entire lung.\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--The diagnosis of horsepox is to be based on the presence\r\nof a continuous fever, with rosy mucous membranes, for several days and\r\nthe appearance of the characteristic eruption. If the eruption is in the\r\nnasal cavities, marked by a considerable discharge and attended with\r\nsubmaxillary abscesses, it may be confounded with strangles. If the\r\nthroat is affected, it may be confounded with an angina (laryngitis or\r\npharyngitis), but in the latter the local trouble precedes or is\r\nconcomitant with the fever, while in the former the fever precedes the\r\nlocal trouble by several days. Variola may be confounded with bronchitis\r\nor pneumonia if complicated with these troubles and the eruption is\r\nabsent from the exterior, but it is of little moment, as the treatment\r\nfor both is much the same. When the eruption is in the neighborhood of\r\nthe genital organs the disease has been mistaken for dourine. In variola\r\nthe eruption is a temporary one; the nodes and pustules are followed by\r\nshallow ulcers and rapid cicatrization unless continued in the vagina or\r\non the penis by the rubbing of the walls and filth which accumulates;\r\nthere are apt to be pustules at other parts of the body. In the venereal\r\ndisease the local trouble commences as a papule and breaks into an\r\nulcer without having formed a pustule. The ulcer has not the convex rosy\r\nappearance of that of the less serious discharge; the symptoms last for\r\na longer period, by which time others aid in differentiating the two. In\r\nglanders the tubercle is hard and, after breaking into an ulcer, the\r\nindurated bottom remains, grayish or dirty white in color, ragged, and\r\nexuding a viscous, oily discharge. There is no disposition to\r\nsuppuration of the neighboring glands. In variola the rosy shallow ulcer\r\nand healthy pus, with the acutely tumefied glands, should not be\r\nmistaken, at least after a day. I have seen in mules acute glanders\r\nwhich required a day's delay to differentiate from strangles; at that\r\ntime the farcy buds appeared.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis._--The average case of horsepox runs a course of dejection,\r\nloss of appetite, and more or less fever for about four days, followed\r\nby a rapid convalescence, and leaves the animal as well and as sound as\r\nbefore. If the eruption has been excessive or confluent, the ulcerations\r\nmay act as irritants and render the animal unfit for use for several\r\nweeks. Laryngitis, pharyngitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia in this\r\ndisease are not of greater gravity than they are when occurring from\r\nother causes. The spots denuded of pigment left by the pustules on the\r\nlips and genitals may temporarily depreciate the value of the animal to\r\na slight degree.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--As this is a disease unattended by alterations of the\r\nblood itself, although a specific fever, and is of a sthenic type,\r\nactive remedies are admissible and indicated. The horse should be placed\r\non a low diet (little or no oats)--bran mashes, a moderate quantity of\r\ngood, sound hay, a few carrots or apples, which will act as laxatives;\r\nalso slop feed. Barley flour is more cooling for mashes than bran or\r\noatmeal. Water may be given as the animal desires it, but it should not\r\nbe cold; if a half bucketful of water is kept in the manger, the horse\r\nwill take but a few swallows at a time. One-dram doses of nitrate of\r\npotash or 1-ounce doses of sweet spirits of niter are useful in the\r\ndrinking water. If the fever is high, the antipyretics are indicated:\r\nSulphate of quinin in 1-dram doses; iodid of potash in 1-dram doses;\r\ninfusion of pine tops, of juniper leaves, of the aromatic herbs, or of\r\nEnglish breakfast tea are useful in the later stages. If complications\r\nof the air passages or lungs are threatened, a large mustard poultice\r\nshould be applied to the belly and sides of the chest. Oxid of zinc\r\nointment should be used on confluent eruptions, and if the ulceration is\r\nexcessive it may have to be touched with caustic.\r\n\r\nGreat care must be taken to keep the animal protected from cold drafts\r\nof air or other exposure. Blankets or sheets should be used on the body\r\nand bandages on the legs. After convalescence is established, nutritious\r\nfeed of easy digestion and walking exercise are all that is needed,\r\nexcept perhaps a little Glauber's salt to prevent constipation.\r\n\r\n_Prophylactic treatment._--When horsepox breaks out among a large number\r\nof horses, especially on a farm where there are a number of colts, it\r\nmay be assumed that the greater majority will contract the disease, and\r\nit is more economical that they should have it and be through with it at\r\nonce. If the weather is moderate, all the animals which have not been\r\naffected can be inoculated, which will produce the disease in a mild\r\nform, with the eruption at a point of election, and render the danger of\r\ncomplication a minimum one. For inoculation the discharge from the\r\npustules of a mild case should be selected and inoculated by\r\nscarification on the belly or the under surface of the neck.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTHRAX.\r\n\r\n     _Synonyms:_ Carbuncle, splenic fever, splenic apoplexy, etc.;\r\n     charbon, sang de rate (French); Miltzbrand (German).\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Anthrax is a severe and usually fatal contagious disease,\r\ncharacterized by chills, great depression and stupor of the animal, and\r\na profound alteration of the blood. It is caused by the entrance into\r\nthe animal's body of a bacterium, known as the _Bacillus anthracis_, or\r\nits spores.\r\n\r\nPractically all animals are susceptible to anthrax. The herbivora are\r\nespecially susceptible, in the following order: The sheep, the ox, and\r\nthe horse. The guinea pig, the hog, the rabbit, mice, and other animals\r\ndie quickly from its effects. Man, the dog, and other omnivora and\r\ncarnivora may be attacked by it in a constitutional form as fatal as in\r\nthe herbivora, but fortunately in many cases develop from it only local\r\ntrouble, followed by recovery.\r\n\r\nAnthrax has been a scourge of the animals of the civilized world since\r\nthe first written history we have of any of their diseases. In 1709-1712\r\nextensive outbreaks of anthrax occurred in Germany, Hungary, and Poland.\r\nIn the first half of the nineteenth century it had become an extensively\r\nspread disease in Russia, Holland, and England, and for the last century\r\nhas been gradually spreading in the Americas, more so in South America\r\nthan here. In 1864, in the five governments of Petersburg, Novgorod,\r\nOlonetz, Twer, and Jaroslaw, in Russia, more than 10,000 horses and\r\nnearly 1,000 persons perished from the disease.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--The causes of anthrax were for a long time attributed\r\nentirely to climatic influence, soil, and atmospheric temperature, and\r\nthey are still recognized as predisposing factors in the development of\r\nthe disease, for it is usually found, especially when outbreaks in a\r\ngreat number of animals occur, in low, damp, marshy countries during the\r\nwarm seasons. It is more frequent in districts where marshy lands dry\r\nout during the heat of summer and are then covered with light rains.\r\nDecaying vegetable matter seems most favorable for nourishing and\r\npreserving the virus.\r\n\r\nThe direct cause of anthrax is always infection of a previously sound\r\nanimal, either directly from a diseased animal or through various media\r\nwhich contain excretions or the debris from the body of one previously\r\ninfected.\r\n\r\nThe specific virus of anthrax was first discovered by Davaine in 1851.\r\nHe recognized microscopic bodies in the form of little rods in the blood\r\nof animals suffering from anthrax. It was not, however, till a quarter\r\nof a century later that Pasteur defined the exact nature of the\r\nbacillus, the mode of its propagation, and its exact relationship to\r\nanthrax as the sole cause of the disease. In the animal body the bacilli\r\nhave a tendency to accumulate in the spleen, liver, and elsewhere, so\r\nthat these organs are much more virulent than the muscles or less\r\nvascular tissues. When eliminated from the animal in the excretions, or\r\nwhen exposed to outside influences by the death of the animal and the\r\ndisintegration of the tissues, the body of the rod is destroyed and the\r\nspores only remain. These spores, which may be called the seeds of the\r\nbacilli, retain their vitality for a long period; they resist ordinary\r\nputrefaction; they are unchanged by moisture; and they are not affected\r\nby moderate heat. If scattered with the debris of a dead animal on the\r\nsurface of the ground, they may remain around the roots of the grass in\r\na pasture or may be washed to the nearest low-lying ground or marsh. If\r\nburied in the body of an animal dead from anthrax, they may be washed\r\ndeep into the ground, and in later years (in one proved case 17 years)\r\nbe brought to the surface and infect other animals. They are frequently\r\nbrought to the surface of the earth, having been swallowed by\r\nearthworms, in the bodies of which they have been found.\r\n\r\nThis accounts for the outbreaks at the time of the first rains after a\r\ndry season. During the latter the earthworm goes deep in the ground in\r\nsearch of moisture; it finds the spore which has been washed there in\r\npast years, swallows it, and afterwards brings it to the surface. The\r\nvirus is carried with the wool from infected sheep and remains in it\r\nthrough the process of manufacture into cloth. The spores remain in the\r\nhides of animals which have died of anthrax and retain their vitality\r\nthroughout months of soaking in the tanners' pits, the working of the\r\nharness maker or the cobbler, and after the oiling of the completed\r\nleather. The dried spores in the dust from any of these products may be\r\ncarried by the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nInfection of an animal takes place through inoculation or contact of the\r\nbacillus or its spores with an abraded surface or mucous membrane, on a\r\nsound animal. In an infected district horses may eat with impunity the\r\nrich pasturage of spring and early summer, but when grass gets low they\r\ncrop it close to the ground, pull up the roots around which the virus\r\nmay be lodged, and under these conditions the animals are more apt to\r\nhave abrasions of the lips or tongue by contact with dried stubble and\r\nthe dirt on the roots; this favors the introduction of the germs into\r\nthe system. The virus may be introduced with feed and enter the\r\nblood-vessel system from the stomach and intestines. If in the dust,\r\ndried hay, or on the parched pasture of late summer, the virus may be\r\ninhaled and be absorbed from the lining of the lungs. If in harness\r\nleather, it needs but an abrasion of the skin, as the harness rubs it,\r\nto transfer the spore from the leather to the circulation of the animal.\r\n\r\nThe writer saw a case of anthrax occur in a groom from the use of a new\r\nhorse brush. The strap which passes over the back of the hand inoculated\r\nan abrasion on the knuckle of the first finger, and in 12 hours a\r\n\"pustule\" had formed and the arm had become infected.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms of anthrax usually develop with extreme\r\nrapidity. The horse is dejected and falls into a state of profound\r\nstupor, attended with great muscular weakness. The feeble, indolent\r\nanimal, if forced to move, drags its legs. There are severe chills,\r\nagitation of the muscles, symptoms of vertigo, and at times colicky\r\npains. The mucous membranes turn a deep ocher or bluish-red color. The\r\nbody temperature is rapidly elevated to 104 deg. or 105 deg. F. The breathing is\r\nincreased to 30 or 40 respirations in the minute and the pulse is\r\ngreatly accelerated, but while the arteries are soft and almost\r\nimperceptible, the heart beats can be felt and heard, violent and\r\ntumultuous. In some cases, when inoculation is through the skin, large\r\nsubcutaneous swellings appear; these may involve a leg, a shoulder, one\r\nside of the body, or the neck or head. The swelling is at first hot and\r\npainful, but afterwards it becomes necrotic and sensation is lost. The\r\nsymptoms last but two, three, or four days at most, when the case\r\nusually terminates fatally. An examination of the blood shows a dark\r\nfluid which will not clot, and which remains black after exposure to the\r\nair. After death the bodies putrefy rapidly and bloat up; the tissues\r\nare filled with gases, and a bloody foam exudes from the mouth,\r\nnostrils, and anus, and frequently the mucous membranes of the rectum\r\nprotrude from the latter. The hairs detach from the skin. Congestion of\r\nall the organs and tissues is found, with interstitial hemorrhages. The\r\nmuscles are friable and are covered with ecchymotic spots. This is\r\nespecially marked in the heart.\r\n\r\nThe black, uncoagulated, and incoagulable blood shows an iridescent scum\r\non its surface, which is due to the fat of the animal dissolved by the\r\nammonia produced by the decomposed tissues. The serum oozes out of every\r\ntissue and contains broken-down blood, which, when examined\r\nmicroscopically, is found to have the red globules crenated and the\r\nleucocytes granular. A high power of the microscope also reveals the\r\nbacteria in the shape of little rodlike bodies of homogeneous texture\r\nwith their brilliant spores.\r\n\r\nThe lymphatic ganglia are increased four, five, six, or ten times their\r\nnatural size, enlarged by the engorgement of blood. The spleen shows\r\nnodulated black spots containing a muddy blood, which is found teeming\r\nwith the virus. This organ is much enlarged and is quite friable. The\r\nmucous membranes of the intestines are congested and reddish brown; the\r\nsurface of the intestines is in many places denuded of its lining\r\nmembrane, showing fissures and hemorrhagic spots. The liver has a cooked\r\nappearance; the kidneys are congested and friable; the urine is red; the\r\npleura, lungs, and the meninges are congested, and the bronchi of the\r\nlungs contain a bloody foam.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment of anthrax in animals by medicinal means has not\r\nproved satisfactory. In cases of local anthrax an incision of the\r\nswelling followed by the application of disinfectants sometimes causes\r\ngood results. In such cases, however, the danger of disseminating the\r\ninfection from the wounds tends to make this procedure inadvisable\r\nunless great care is taken.\r\n\r\nGood results are obtained from the use of serum in the treatment of the\r\ndisease. For this purpose 30 to 100 cubic centimeters should be\r\nadministered subcutaneously or intravenously. If no improvement is\r\nnoticed within 24 hours the injection should be repeated. In a number of\r\ninstances afforded to test the curative value of the serum in cases of\r\nanthrax in man and animals splendid results were obtained.\r\n\r\nThe prophylactic treatment formerly consisted in the avoidance of\r\ncertain fields and marshes which were recognized as contaminated during\r\nthe months of August and September and had been occupied the years in\r\nwhich the outbreaks usually occurred. It underwent, however, a\r\nrevolution after the discovery by Pasteur of the possibility of a\r\nprophylactic inoculation or vaccination which granted immunity from\r\nfuture attacks of the disease similar to that granted by the recovery of\r\nan animal from an ordinary attack of the disease.\r\n\r\nThis treatment consists in the use of a vaccine which is made by the\r\nartificial cultivation of the virus of anthrax in broth and in the\r\ntreatment of it by means of continued exposure to a high temperature for\r\na certain time, which weakens the virus to such extent that it is\r\ncapable of producing only a very mild and not dangerous attack of\r\nanthrax in the animal in which it is inoculated, and thus protects it\r\nfrom inoculation of a stronger virus. The production of this virus,\r\nwhich is carried on in some countries at the expense of the governments\r\nand is furnished at a small cost to the farmers in regions where the\r\ndisease prevails, in this country is made in private laboratories only.\r\n\r\nAt the present time very good results are being obtained with\r\nvaccination consisting of an injection of highly potent anthrax serum on\r\none side of the animal and a vaccine on the other side. This method of\r\ntreatment requires only a single handling of the animals and further\r\npossesses advantages over the Pasteur treatment in that it immediately\r\nmakes animals immune. In the numerous applications of this form of\r\ntreatment very good results have been obtained and the immunity produced\r\nthereby visually lasts at least one year. The vaccinated animals should\r\nbe kept for a period of ten days to two weeks from exposure, since\r\nduring that period they are at times even more susceptible to the\r\ndisease, and therefore care should be taken not to reduce their\r\nvitality.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--In attempts to control the disease it is essential, aside\r\nfrom protective vaccination, to prevent the reinfection of localities.\r\nFor this purpose it is essential, if possible, to drain thoroughly and\r\nkeep under cultivation the infected areas before animals are permitted\r\nto pasture on them. The complete destruction of all anthrax carcasses is\r\nalso very important. This is best accomplished by burning, but as this\r\nmethod of disposal is impracticable in many localities, deep burial may\r\nbe found to be better. Covering the carcasses within their graves with\r\nquicklime adds another valuable precaution against further dissemination\r\nof the infection. No animal dying from anthrax should ever be skinned or\r\ncut open, as the blood from these sources is one of the most dangerous\r\nmeans of spreading the infection, being charged, while in the animal,\r\nwith great numbers of bacilli, which quickly turn into spores as soon as\r\nspread about upon the face of the ground. All discharges from the body\r\nopenings should also be burned or buried deeply, as they are frequently\r\nof a virulent character.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLANDERS AND FARCY.\r\n\r\n(Pls. XL-XLII.)\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Let it be understood at the outset that glanders and\r\nfarcy are one and the same disease, differing only in that the first\r\nterm is applied to the disease when the local lesions predominate in the\r\ninternal organs, especially in the nostrils, lungs, and air tubes, and\r\nthat the second term is applied to it when the principal manifestation\r\nis an outbreak of the lesions on the exterior or skin of the animal. The\r\nterm glanders applies to the disease in both forms, while the term farcy\r\nis limited to the visible appearance of external trouble only; but in\r\nthe latter case internal lesions always exist, although they may not be\r\nevident.\r\n\r\nGlanders is a contagious constitutional disease of the genus _Equus_\r\n(the horse, ass, and mule), readily communicable to man, the dog, the\r\ncat, the rabbit, and the guinea pig. It is transmitted with difficulty\r\nto sheep and goats, and cattle seem to be entirely immune. It runs a\r\nvariable course and usually produces the death of the animal affected\r\nwith it. It is characterized by the formation of neoplasms, or nodules,\r\nof connective tissue, which degenerate into ulcers, from which exude a\r\npeculiar discharge. It is accompanied with a variable degree of fever,\r\naccording to the rapidity of its course. It is subject to various\r\ncomplications of the lymphatic glands, of the lungs, of the testicles,\r\nof the internal organs, and of the subcutaneous connective tissue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XL.\r\n\r\nGLANDERS.\r\n\r\nNasal septum of horse, right side, showing acute lesions.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLI.\r\n\r\nGLANDERS.\r\n\r\nMiddle region of nasal septum, left side, showing ulcers.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLII.\r\n\r\nGLANDERS.\r\n\r\nPosterior half of nasal septum, right side, showing cicatrices.]\r\n\r\n_History._--Glanders is one of the oldest diseases of which we have\r\ndefinite knowledge in the history of medicine. Absyrtus, the Greek\r\nveterinarian in the army of Constantine the Great, described it with\r\nconsiderable accuracy and recognized the contagiousness of its\r\ncharacter. Another Greek veterinarian, Vegetius Renatus, who lived in\r\nthe time of Theodosius (381 A. D.), described, under the name of\r\n\"malleus humidus,\" a disease of the horse characterized by a nasal\r\ndischarge and accompanied by superficial ulcers. He recognized the\r\ncontagious properties of the discharge of the external ulcers, and\r\nrecommended that all animals sick with the disease be separated at once\r\nwith the greatest care from the others and should be pastured in\r\nseparate fields, for fear the other animals should become affected.\r\n\r\nIn 1682 Sollysel, the stable master of Louis XIV, published an account\r\nof glanders and farcy, which he considered closely related to each\r\nother, although he did not recognize them as identical. He admitted the\r\nexistence of a virus which communicated the disease from an infected\r\nanimal to a sound one. He called special attention to the feed troughs\r\nand water buckets as being the media of contagion. He divided glanders\r\ninto two forms--one malignant and contagious and the other benign--and\r\nhe stated that there was always danger of infection.\r\n\r\nGarsault in 1746 said that \"as this disease is communicated very easily\r\nand can infect in a very short time a prodigious number of horses by\r\nmeans of the discharges which may be licked up, animals infected with\r\nglanders should be destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nBourgelat, the founder of veterinary schools, in his \"Elements of\r\nHippiatry,\" published in 1755, establishes glanders as a virulent\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nExtensive outbreaks of glanders are described as prevailing in the great\r\narmies of continental Europe and England from time to time during the\r\nperiods of all the wars of the last few centuries.\r\n\r\nGlanders was imported into America at the close of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, and before the end of the first half of the last century had\r\nspread to a considerable degree among the horses of the Middle and\r\nimmediately adjoining Southern States. This disease was unknown in\r\nMexico until carried there during the Mexican War by the badly diseased\r\nhorses of the United States Army. During the first half of the last\r\ncentury a large body of veterinarians and medical men protested against\r\nthe contagious character of the disease, and by their opinion prevailed\r\nto such an extent against the common opinion that several of the\r\nGovernments of Europe undertook a series of experiments to determine the\r\nright between the contesting parties.\r\n\r\nAt the veterinary school at Alfort and at the farm of Lamirault in\r\nFrance several hundred horses which had passed examination as sound had\r\nplaced among them glandered horses under various conditions. The results\r\nof these experiments proved conclusively the contagious character of the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 Bouchard, of the faculty of medicine in Paris, assisted by\r\nCapitan and Charrin, undertook a series of experiments with matter taken\r\nfrom the farcy ulcer of a human being. They afterwards continued their\r\nexperiments with matter taken from horses, and in 1883 succeeded in\r\nshowing that glanders is caused by a bacterium which is capable of\r\npropagation and reproduction of others of its own kind if placed in the\r\nproper media. In 1882 the specific germ of glanders was first discovered\r\nand described by Loeffler and Schuetz in Germany.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to study the etiology of glanders, the difference of\r\nsusceptibility on the part of different species of animals, or even on\r\nthe part of individuals of the same species, and when we come to find\r\nproof of the slow incubation and latent character of the disease as it\r\nexists in certain individuals, we understand how in a section of country\r\ncontaining a number of glandered animals others can seem to contract and\r\ndevelop the disease without having apparently been exposed to contagion.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--The contagious nature of glanders, in no matter what form it\r\nappears, being to-day definitely demonstrated, we can recognize but one\r\ncause for all cases, and that is contagion by means of the specific\r\nvirus of the disease. The causative organism is known as the _Bacillus\r\nmallei_.\r\n\r\nIn studying the writings of the older authors on glanders, and the works\r\nof those authors who contested the contagious nature of the disease, we\r\nfind a large number of predisposing causes assigned as factors in the\r\ndevelopment of the malady.\r\n\r\nWhile a virus from a case of glanders if inoculated into an animal of\r\nthe genus _Equus_ will inevitably produce the disease, we find a vast\r\ndifference in the contagious activity of different cases of glanders. We\r\nfind a great variation in the manner and rapidity of the development of\r\nthe disease in different individuals and that the contagion is much more\r\nliable to be carried to sound animals under certain circumstances than\r\nit is under others. Only certain species of animals are susceptible of\r\ncontracting the disease, and while some of these contract it as a\r\ngeneral constitutional malady, in others it develops as only a local\r\nsore.\r\n\r\nIn acute glanders the contagion is found in its most virulent form, as\r\nis shown by the inevitable infection of susceptible animals inoculated\r\nwith the disease, while the discharge from chronic semilatent glanders\r\nand farcy may at times be inoculated with a negative result; again, in\r\nacute glanders, as we have a free discharge, a much greater quantity of\r\nvirus-containing matter is scattered in the neighborhood of an infected\r\nhorse to serve as a contagion to others than is found in the small\r\namount of discharge of the chronic cases.\r\n\r\nThe chances of contagion are much greater when sound horses, asses, or\r\nmules are placed in the immediate neighborhood of glandered horses,\r\ndrink from the same bucket, stand in the next stall, or work in the same\r\nwagon, or are fed from feed boxes or mangers which have been impregnated\r\nby the saliva and soiled by the discharge of sick animals. Transmission\r\noccurs by direct contact of the discharges of a glandered animal with\r\nthe tissues of a sound one, either on the exterior, when swallowed mixed\r\nwith feed into the digestive tract, or when dried and inhaled as dust.\r\n\r\nThe stable attendants serve as one of the most common carriers of the\r\nvirus. Dried or fresh discharges are collected from the infected animals\r\nin cleaning, harnessing, feeding, and by means of the hands, clothing,\r\nthe teeth of the currycomb, the sponge, the bridle, and the halter, and\r\nare thus carried to other animals.\r\n\r\nAn animal affected with chronic glanders in a latent form is moved from\r\none part of the stable to another, or works hitched with one horse and\r\nthen with another, and may be an active agent in the spreading of the\r\ndisease without the cause being recognized.\r\n\r\nGlanders is found frequently in the most insidious forms, and we\r\nrecognize that it can exist without being apparent; that is, it may\r\naffect a horse for a long period without showing any symptoms that will\r\nallow even the most experienced veterinarian to make a diagnosis. An old\r\ngray mare belonging to a tavern keeper was reserved for family use with\r\ngood care and light work for a period of eight years, during which time\r\nother horses in the tavern stable were from time to time affected with\r\nglanders without an apparent cause. The mare, whose only trouble was an\r\napparent attack of heaves, was sold to a huckster who placed her at hard\r\nwork. Want of feed and overwork and exposure rapidly developed a case of\r\nacute glanders, from which the animal died, and at the autopsy were\r\nfound the lesions of an acute pneumonia of glanders grafted on chronic\r\nlesions, consisting of old nodules which had undoubtedly existed for\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIn a case that once came under the care of the writer, a coach horse was\r\nexamined for soundness and passed as sound by a prominent veterinarian,\r\nwho a few months afterwards treated the horse for a skin eruption from\r\nwhich it recovered. Twelve months afterwards it came into the hands of\r\nthe writer, hidebound, with a slight cough and a slight eruption of the\r\nskin, which was attributed to clipping and the rubbing of the harness,\r\nbut which had nothing suspicious in its character. The horse was placed\r\non tonics and put to regular light driving. In six weeks it developed a\r\nbronchitis without having been specially exposed, and in two days this\r\ntrouble was followed by a lobular pneumonia and the breaking of an\r\nabscess in the right lung. Farcy buds developed on the surface of the\r\nbody and the animal died. The autopsy showed the existence of a number\r\nof old glanderous nodules in the lungs which must have existed previous\r\nto purchase, more than a year before.\r\n\r\nPublic watering troughs and the feed boxes of boarding stables and the\r\ntavern stables of market towns are among the most common recipients for\r\nthe virus of glanders, which is most dangerous in its fresh state, but\r\ncases have been known to be caused by feeding animals in the box or\r\nstall in which glandered animals had stood several months before. While\r\nthe discharge from a case of chronic glanders is much less liable to\r\ncontain many active bacilli than that from a case of acute glanders, the\r\nformer, if it infects an animal, will produce the same disease as the\r\nlatter. It may assume from the outset an acute or chronic form,\r\naccording to the susceptibility of the animal infected, and this does\r\nnot depend upon the character of the disease from which the virus was\r\nderived.\r\n\r\nThe animals of the genus _Equus_--the horse, the ass, and the mule--are\r\nthose which are the most susceptible to contract glanders, but in these\r\nwe find a much greater receptivity in the ass and mule than we do in the\r\nhorse. In the ass and mule in almost all cases the period of incubation\r\nis short and the disease develops in an acute form. We find that the\r\nkind of horse infected has an influence on the character of the disease;\r\nin full-blooded, fat horses of a sanguinary temperament, the disease\r\nusually develops in an acute form, while in the lymphatic, cold-blooded,\r\nmore common race of horses the disease usually assumes a chronic form.\r\nIf the disease develops first in the chronic form in a horse in fair\r\ncondition, starvation and overwork are liable to bring on an acute\r\nattack, but when the disease is inoculated into a debilitated and\r\nimpoverished animal it is apt to start in the latent form. Inoculation\r\non the lips or the exterior of the animal is frequently followed by an\r\nacute attack, while infection by ingestion of the virus and inoculation\r\nby means of the digestive tract is often followed by the trouble in the\r\nchronic latent form.\r\n\r\nIn the dog the inoculation of glanders may develop a constitutional\r\ndisease with all the symptoms which are found in the horse, but more\r\nfrequently the virus pullulates only at the point of inoculation,\r\nremaining for some time as a local sore, which may then heal, leaving a\r\nperfectly sound animal; but while the local sore is continuing to\r\nulcerate, and specific virus exists in it, it may be the carrier of\r\ncontagion to other animals. In man we find a greater receptivity to\r\nglanders than in the dog, and in many unfortunate cases the virus\r\nspreads from the point of inoculation to the entire system and destroys\r\nthe wretched mortal by extensive ulcers of the face and hemorrhage or by\r\ndestruction of the lung tissue; in other cases, however, glanders may\r\ndevelop, as in the dog, in local form only, not infecting the\r\nconstitution and terminating in recovery, while the specific ulcer by\r\nproper treatment is turned into a simple one. In the feline species\r\nglanders is more destructive than in the dog. The point of inoculation\r\nulcerates rapidly and the entire system becomes infected.\r\n\r\nWhile a student the writer saw a lion in the service of Prof. Trasbot,\r\nat Alfort, which had contracted the disease by eating glandered meat and\r\ndied with the lung riddled with nodules. A litter of kittens lapped the\r\nblood from the lungs of a glandered horse on which an autopsy was being\r\nmade, and in four days almost their entire faces, including the nasal\r\nbones, were eaten away by rapid ulceration. Nodules were found in the\r\nlungs. A pack of wolves in the Philadelphia Zoological Garden died in 10\r\ndays after being fed with the meat of a glandered horse. The rabbit,\r\nguinea pig, and mice are especially susceptible to the inoculation of\r\nglanders, and these animals are convenient witnesses and proofs of the\r\nexistence of suspected cases of the glanders in other animals by the\r\nresults of successful inoculations.\r\n\r\nThe primary lesion in any form is a local point in which occurs a rapid\r\nproliferation of the cell elements which make up the animal tissue with\r\nformation of new connective tissue, with a crowding together of the\r\nelements until their own pressure on one another cuts off the\r\ncirculation and nutrition, and death takes place in them in the form of\r\nulceration or gangrene. Following this primary lesion we have an\r\nextension of infection by means of the spread of the bacilli into those\r\ntissues immediately surrounding the first infected spot, which are most\r\nsuitable for the development of simple inflammatory phenomena or the\r\nspecific virus. The primary symptoms are the result of specific reaction\r\nat the point of inoculation, but at a later time the virus is carried by\r\nmeans of the blood vessels and lymphatic vessels to other parts of the\r\nbody and becomes lodged at different places and develops in them; again,\r\nwhen the disease has existed in the latent form in the lungs of the\r\nanimal and the virus is wakened into action from any cause, we have it\r\ncarried to various parts of the body and developing in the most\r\nsusceptible regions or organs. The points of development are most\r\nfrequently determined by the activity of the circulation and the\r\neffects of exterior irritants. For example, if a horse which has been so\r\nslightly affected with the virus of glanders that no symptoms are\r\nvisible is exposed to cold, rain, or sleet, or by the rubbing of the\r\nharness on the body and the irritation of mud on the legs, the disease\r\nis liable to develop on the exterior in the form of farcy, while a\r\nfull-blooded horse which is employed at speed and has its lungs and\r\nrespiratory tract gorged with blood from the extreme use of these organs\r\nwill develop glanders as the local manifestation of the disease in the\r\nrespiratory tract.\r\n\r\nThe previous reference to the existence of glanders under the two forms\r\nmore commonly differentiated as glanders and as farcy, and our reference\r\nto the various conditions in which it may exist as acute, chronic, and\r\nlatent, show that the disease may assume several different phases.\r\nWithout for a moment losing sight of the fact that all these varied\r\nconditions are identical in their origin and in their essence, for\r\nconvenience of study we may divide glanders into three classes--chronic\r\nfarcy, chronic glanders, and acute glanders with or without farcy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONIC FARCY.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--In farcy the symptoms commence by formation of little nodes\r\non the under surface of the skin, which rapidly infringe on the tissues\r\nof the skin itself. These nodes, which are known as farcy \"buds\" and\r\nfarcy \"buttons,\" are from the size of a bullet to the size of a walnut.\r\nThey are hot, sensitive to the touch, at first elastic and afterwards\r\nbecome soft; the tissue is destroyed, and infringing on the substance of\r\nthe skin the disease produces an ulcer, which is known as a chancre.\r\nThis ulcer is irregular in shape, with ragged edges which overhang the\r\nsore; it has a gray, dirty bottom and the discharge is sometimes thin\r\nand sometimes purulent; in either case it is mixed with a viscous,\r\nsticky, yellowish material like the white of an egg in consistency and\r\nlike olive oil in appearance. The discharge is almost diagnostic; it\r\nresembles somewhat the discharge which we have in greasy heels and in\r\ncertain attacks of lymphangitis, but to the expert the specific\r\ndischarge is characteristic. The discharge accumulates on the hair\r\nsurrounding the ulcer and over its surface and dries, forming scabs\r\nwhich become thicker by successive deposits on the under surface until\r\nthey fall off, to be replaced by others of the same kind; and the excess\r\nof discharge may drop on the hairs below and form similar brownish\r\nyellow crusts. The farcy ulcers may retain their specific form for a\r\nconsiderable time--days or even weeks--but eventually the discharge\r\nbecomes purulent in character and assumes the appearance of healthy\r\nmatter. The surface of the gangrenous bottom of the ulcer is replaced by\r\nrosy granulations, the ragged edges are beveled off, and the chancre is\r\nturned into a simple ulcer which rapidly heals.\r\n\r\nThe farcy buttons occur most frequently on the sides of the lips, the\r\nsides of the neck, the lower part of the shoulders, the inside of the\r\nthighs, or the outside of the legs, but may occur on any part of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nWe have next an irritation of the lymphatic vessels in the neighborhood\r\nof the chancres. Those become swollen and then indurated and appear like\r\ngreat ridges underneath the skin; they are hot to the touch and\r\nsensitive. The cords may remain for a considerable time and then\r\ngradually disappear, or they may ulcerate like a farcy bud itself,\r\nforming elongated, irregular, serpentine ulcers with a characteristic,\r\ndirty, gray bottom and ragged edges, and pour out a viscous, oily\r\ndischarge like the chancres themselves.\r\n\r\nThe essential symptoms of farcy are, as above described, the button, the\r\nchancre, the cord, and the discharge. We have in addition to these\r\nsymptoms a certain number of accessory symptoms, which, while not\r\ndiagnostic in themselves, are of great service in aiding the diagnosis\r\nin cases where the eruption takes place in small quantities, and when\r\nthe ulcers are not characteristic.\r\n\r\nEpistaxis, or bleeding from the nose without previous work or other\r\napparent cause, is one of the frequent concomitant symptoms in glanders,\r\nand such hemorrhage from the nostrils should always be regarded with\r\nsuspicion. The animal with farcy frequently develops a cough, resembling\r\nmuch that which we find in heaves--a short, dry, aborted, hacking cough,\r\nwith little or no discharge from the nostrils. With this we find an\r\nirregular movement of the flanks, and on auscultation of the lungs we\r\nfind sibilant or at times a few mucous rales. Another common symptom is\r\na sudden swelling of one of the hind legs; it is found suddenly swollen\r\nin the region of the cannon, the enlargement extending below to the\r\npastern and above as high as the stifle. This swelling is hot and\r\npainful to the touch, and renders the animal stiff and lame. On pressure\r\nwith the finger the swelling can be indented, but the pits so formed\r\nsoon fill again on removal of the pressure. In severe cases we may have\r\nulceration of the skin, and serum pours out from the surface, resembling\r\nthe oozing which we have after a blister or in a case of grease. This\r\nswelling is not to be confounded with the stocking in lymphatic horses\r\nor the edema which we have in chronic heart or in kidney trouble, as in\r\nthe last the swelling is cool, not painful, and the pitting on pressure\r\nremains for some time after the latter is withdrawn. It is not to be\r\nconfounded with greasy heels. In these the disease commences in the\r\nneighborhood of the pastern and gradually extends up the leg, rarely\r\npassing beyond the neighborhood of the hock. The swollen leg in\r\nglanders almost invariably swells for the entire length in a single\r\nnight or within a very short period. When greasy heels are complicated\r\nby lymphangitis we have a condition very much resembling that of farcy.\r\nThe swelled leg in farcy is frequently followed by an outbreak of farcy\r\nbuttons and ulcers over its surface. In the entire horse the testicles\r\nare frequently swollen and hot and sensitive to the touch, but they have\r\nno tendency to suppuration. The acute inflammation is rapidly followed\r\nby the specific induration, which corresponds to the local lesions in\r\nother parts of the body.\r\n\r\nChronic farcy in the ass and mule is an excessively rare condition, but\r\nsometimes occurs.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONIC GLANDERS.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--In chronic glanders we find the same train of inflammatory\r\nphenomena, varying in appearance from those of chronic farcy only by the\r\ndifference of the tissues in which they are situated. In chronic\r\nglanders there is first the nodule, from the size of a shot to that of a\r\nsmall pea, which forms in the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract.\r\nThis may be just inside the wings of the nostrils or on the septum which\r\ndivides the one nasal cavity from the other, and may be easily detected,\r\nor it may be higher in the nasal cavities on the turbinated bones, or it\r\nmay form in the larnyx itself or on the surface of the trachea or deep\r\nin the lungs.\r\n\r\nThe nodules, which are first red and hard and consist of new connective\r\ntissue, soon soften and become yellow; the yellow spots break and we\r\nhave a small ulcer the size of the preceding nodule, which has a gray,\r\ndirty bottom and ragged edges and is known as a chancre. This ulcer\r\npours from its surface a viscous, oily discharge similar to that which\r\nwe have seen in the farcy ulcer. The irritation of the discharge may\r\nulcerate the lining mucous membrane of the nose, causing serpentine\r\ngutters with bottoms resembling those of the chancres themselves. If the\r\nnodules have formed in large numbers, we may have them causing an acute\r\ninflammation of the Schneiderian membrane, with a catarrhal discharge\r\nwhich may mark the specific discharge, or that which comes from the\r\nulcers and resembles the discharge of strangles or simple inflammatory\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nThe eruption of the ulcers and discharge soon cause an irritation of the\r\nneighboring lymphatics; and in the intermaxillary space, deep inside of\r\nthe jaws, we find an enlargement of the glands, which for the first few\r\ndays may seem soft and edematous, but which rapidly becomes confined to\r\nthe glands, these being from the size of an almond to that of a small\r\nbunch of berries, exceedingly hard and nodulated. This enlargement of\r\nthe glands is found high on the inside of the jaws, firmly adherent to\r\nthe base of the tongue. It is not to be confounded with the puffy,\r\nedematous swelling, which is not separated from the skin and\r\nsubcutaneous connective tissues found in strangles, in laryngitis, and\r\nin other simple inflammatory troubles.\r\n\r\nThese glands bear a great resemblance to the indurated glands which we\r\nfind in connection with the collection of pus in the sinuses; but in the\r\nlatter disease the glands have not the extreme nodulated feel which they\r\nhave in glanders. With the glands we find indurated cords, feeling like\r\nballs of tangled wire or twine, fastening the glands together.\r\n\r\nThe essential symptoms of glanders are the nodule, the chancre, the\r\nglands, and the discharge. With the development of the nodules in the\r\nrespiratory tract, according to their number and the amount of eruption\r\nwhich they cause, we may find a cough which resembles that of a coryza,\r\na laryngitis, a bronchitis, or a broncho-pneumonia, according to the\r\nlocation of the lesions. In chronic glanders we find the same accessory\r\nsymptoms that occur in chronic farcy, the hemorrhage of the nose, the\r\nswelling of the legs, the chronic cough, and, in the entire horse, the\r\nswelling of the testicles.\r\n\r\nOn healing, the chancres on the mucous membranes leave small, whitish,\r\nstar-shaped scars, hard and indurated to the touch, and which remain for\r\nalmost an indefinite time. The chancres heal and the other local\r\nsymptoms disappear, with the exception of the enlargement of the glands,\r\nand we find these so diminished in size that they are scarcely\r\nperceptible on examination. During the subacute attacks, with a minimum\r\nquantity of local troubles, in chronic glanders and in chronic farcy the\r\nanimal rarely shows any degree of fever, but does have a generally\r\ndepraved appearance; it loses flesh and becomes hidebound; the skin\r\nbecomes dry and the hairs stand on end. There is a cachexia, however,\r\nwhich resembles greatly that of any chronic, organic trouble, but is not\r\ndiagnostic, although it has in it certain appearances and conditions\r\nwhich often render the animal suspicious to the eye of the expert\r\nveterinarian, while, without the presence of local lesions he would be\r\nunable to state on what he has based his opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nACUTE GLANDERS.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--In the acute form of glanders we find the symptoms which we\r\nhave just studied in chronic farcy and in chronic glanders in a more\r\nacute and aggravated form. There is a rapid outbreak of nodules in the\r\nrespiratory tract which rapidly degenerate into chancres and pour out a\r\nconsiderable discharge from the nostrils. There is a cough of more or\r\nless severity according to the amount and site of the local eruption.\r\nOver the surface of the body swellings occur which are rapidly followed\r\nby farcy buttons, which break into ulcers; we find the indurated cords\r\nand enlargement of the lymphatics.\r\n\r\nBleeding from the nose, sudden swelling of one of the hind legs, and the\r\nswelling of the testicles are liable to precede an acute eruption of\r\nglanders. As the symptoms become more marked the animal has difficulty\r\nof respiration, the flanks heave, the respiration becomes rapid, the\r\npulse becomes quickened, and the temperature becomes elevated to 103 deg.,\r\n104 deg., or 105 deg. F.\r\n\r\nWith the other symptoms of an acute fever the general appearance and\r\nstation of the animal is that of one suffering from an acute pneumonia,\r\nbut upon examination, while we may find sibilant and mucous rales over\r\nthe side of the chest, and may possibly hear tubular murmurs at the base\r\nof the neck over the trachea, we fail to find the tubular murmur or the\r\nlarge area of dullness on percussion over the sides of the chest which\r\nbelongs to simple pneumonia.\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--When there is doubt as to the diagnosis, the mallein test,\r\nthe inoculation test, or the complement-fixation test may be employed.\r\nThe mallein test is made by injecting mallein (a sterilized extract from\r\na culture of glanders bacilli) beneath the skin. If the horse has\r\nglanders there results a febrile reaction and a swelling at the point of\r\ninjection. If the horse does not have glanders the mallein has no effect\r\nor, at most, it produces a slight swelling only at the point of\r\ninjection. The inoculation test consists in the inoculation of a\r\nsusceptible animal (usually a guinea pig) with some of the suspected\r\ndischarge from the nose or a farcy ulcer. If the material is properly\r\nused, and if it contains bacilli of glanders, the experimental animal\r\nwill develop the disease.\r\n\r\nThe eye test is now universally accepted as a very satisfactory means of\r\ndiagnosing glanders. This consists in dropping into an eye of a\r\nsuspected animal a specially prepared solution of mallein, as a result\r\nof which in an infected animal the inflammation develops in the eye,\r\nresulting in a discharge which varies in intensity from a mucopurulent\r\ncharacter to a thick, sticky pus. The eyelids may also swell and many\r\ntimes become glued together. The reaction usually appears in from 8 to\r\n20 hours after the introduction of the mallein.\r\n\r\nNeither of these tests should be put into use except by a competent\r\nveterinarian. The complement-fixation test is a highly specialized\r\nlaboratory test and can be carried out only by one versed in laboratory\r\ntechnique. (See Bureau of Animal Industry Bulletin 136.)\r\n\r\nThe post-mortem examination of the lungs shows that the pneumonia of\r\nglanders is a lobular, V-shaped pneumonia scattered throughout the lungs\r\nand caused by the specific inflammatory process taking place at the\r\ndivergence of the smaller air tubes of the lungs. In some cases of acute\r\nglanders the formation of nodules may so irritate the mucous membrane of\r\nthe respiratory tract and cause such a profuse discharge of mucopurulent\r\nor purulent matter that the specific character of the original discharge\r\nis entirely masked. In this case, too, for a few days the submaxillary\r\nspace may so swell as to resemble the edematous, inflamed glands of\r\nstrangles, equine variola, or laryngitis. This condition is especially\r\nliable to be marked in an acute outbreak of glanders in a drove of\r\nmules.\r\n\r\nCases of chronic farcy and glanders, if not destroyed, may live in a\r\ndepraved condition until the animal dies from general emaciation and\r\nanemia, but in the majority of cases, from some sudden exposure to cold,\r\nit develops an acute pneumonia or other simple inflammatory trouble\r\nwhich starts the latent disease and the animal has acute glanders.\r\n\r\nIn the ass, mule, and plethoric horses acute glanders usually terminates\r\nby lobular pneumonia. In other cases the general symptoms may subside.\r\nThe symptoms of pneumonia gradually disappear, the temperature lowers,\r\nthe pulse becomes slower, the ulcers heal, leaving small, indurated\r\ncicatrices, and the animal may return to apparent health, or may at\r\nleast be able to do a small amount of work with but a few symptoms of\r\nthe disease remaining in a chronic form. During the attack of acute\r\nglanders the inflammation of the nasal cavities frequently spreads into\r\nthe sinuses or air cells, which are found in the forehead and in front\r\nof the eyes on either side of the face, and causes abscesses of these\r\ncavities, which may remain as the only visible symptom of the disease.\r\nAn animal which has recovered from a case of acute glanders, like the\r\nanimals which are affected by chronic glanders and chronic farcy, is\r\nliable to be affected with emphysema of the lungs (heaves), and to have\r\na chronic cough. In this condition it may continue for a long period,\r\nserving as a dangerous source of contagion, the more so because the\r\nslight quantity of discharge does not serve as a warning to the owner or\r\ndriver as profuse discharge does in the more acute cases.\r\n\r\nAt the post-mortem examination of an animal which has been destroyed or\r\nhas died of glanders we find evidences of the various lesions which we\r\nhave studied in the symptoms. In addition to this, we find nodules\r\nsimilar to those which we have seen on the exterior throughout the\r\nvarious organs of the body. Nodules may be found in the liver, in the\r\nspleen, and in the kidneys. We may find inflammation of the periosteum\r\nof the bones, and we have excessive alterations in the marrow in the\r\ninterior of the bones themselves. Both these conditions during the life\r\nof the animal may have been the cause of the lamenesses which were\r\ndifficult to diagnose.\r\n\r\nIn one case which came under the observation of the writer, a lame horse\r\nwas destroyed and found to have a large abscess of the bone of the arm,\r\nwith old nodules of the lungs. When an animal has died immediately after\r\nan attack of a primary, acute case of glanders, we find small V-shaped\r\nspots of acute pneumonia in the lungs. If the animal has made an\r\napparent recovery from acute glanders, and in cases of chronic farcy\r\nand chronic glanders, no matter how few the external and visible\r\nsymptoms may have been, there is a deposit of nodules--small, hard,\r\nindurated nodes--of new connective tissue to be found in the lungs. When\r\nthese have existed for some time we may find a deposit of lime salts in\r\nthem. These indurated nodules retain the virus and their power to give\r\nout contagion for almost an indefinite time, and predispose to the\r\ncauses which we have studied as the common factors in developing a\r\nchronic case into an acute case; that is, an inflammatory process wakens\r\ntheir vitality and produces a reinfection of the entire animal. The\r\nblood of an animal suffering from chronic glanders and farcy is not\r\nvirulent and is unaltered, but during the attack of acute glanders,\r\nwhile the animal has fever, the blood becomes virulent and remains so\r\nfor a few days.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Almost the entire list of drugs in the pharmacopoeia has\r\nbeen tested in the treatment of glanders. Good hygienic surroundings,\r\ngood feed, with alteratives and tonics, frequently ameliorate the\r\nsymptoms, and often do so to such an extent that the animal would pass\r\nthe examination of any expert as a perfectly sound animal. While in this\r\ncase the number of nodules of the lungs, which are invariably there, may\r\nbe so few as not to cause sufficient disturbance in the respiration as\r\nto attract the attention of the examiner, yet they exist, and will\r\nremain there almost indefinitely, with the constant possibility of a\r\nreturn of acute symptoms.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that some horses may recover from glanders if the\r\ninfection is slight, but it will not do to depend upon this except under\r\nthe most stringent veterinary supervision. With good care, good feed,\r\ngood surroundings and little work, an animal affected with glanders may\r\nlive for months or even years in a state of apparently perfect health,\r\nbut with the first deprivation of feed, with a few days of severe hard\r\nwork, with exposure to cold or with the attack of a simple fever or\r\ninflammatory trouble from other causes, the latent seeds of the disease\r\nbreak out and develop the trouble again in an acute form.\r\n\r\nIn several celebrated cases horses which have been affected with\r\nglanders have been known to work for years and die from other causes\r\nwithout ever having had the return of symptoms; but allowing that these\r\ncases may occur, they are so few and far between, and the danger of\r\ninfection of glanders to other horses and to the stable attendants is so\r\ngreat, that no animal which has once been affected with the disease\r\nshould be allowed to live unless repeated mallein tests have shown him\r\nto have become free from taint of glanders.\r\n\r\nIn all civilized countries, with the exception of some of the States in\r\nthe United States, the laws are most stringent regarding the prompt\r\ndeclaration on the part of the owner and attending veterinarian at the\r\nfirst suspicion of a case of glanders, and they allow indemnity for the\r\nanimal. When this is done, in all cases the animal is destroyed and the\r\narticles with which it has been in contact are thoroughly disinfected.\r\nWhen the attendants have attempted to hide the presence of the disease\r\nin a community, punishment is meted out to the owner, attending\r\nveterinarian, or other responsible parties. Several States have passed\r\nexcellent laws in regard to glanders, but these laws are not always\r\ncarried out with the rigidity with which they should be.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPOROTRICHOSIS (MYCOTIC LYMPHANGITIS).\r\n\r\nBy JOHN R. MOHLER, V. M. D., _Assistant Chief, Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry_.\r\n\r\nThis disease has previously been known in this country as epizootic\r\nlymphangitis, or pseudo-farcy. It is a chronic, contagious disease,\r\nparticularly of equines, caused by a specific organism, the\r\n_Sporotrichum schenckii_, and characterized by a suppurative\r\ninflammation of the subcutaneous lymph vessels and the neighboring lymph\r\nglands. Owing to the fact that this affection does not spread as an\r\nepizootic and that its causal factor is a fungus, the name\r\nsporotrichosis has been suggested.\r\n\r\nThe disease in man was first described by Schenck and by Beurmann and\r\nGougerot. Carougeau observed its occurrence among horses and mules in\r\nMadagascar, while in the United States it was first observed by Pearson\r\nin Pennsylvania in 1907, although it is probable that it had existed for\r\nmany years in various parts of this country. Page and Frothingham were\r\nfirst to recognize its mycotic nature in the United States. More\r\nrecently Meyer has also made valuable contributions with regard to the\r\nexistence of this affection. Its presence has been definitely\r\nestablished in Ohio, Iowa, California, and North Dakota, and there is a\r\nprobability of its existence in Indiana and several Western States.\r\n\r\n_Bacteriology._--The sporotrichum is 2 microns thick, cylindrical and\r\nsegmented, having more or less branching threads, which bear spores at\r\nthe end. In the pus they occur as slightly ovoid bodies 3 to 5 microns\r\nlong, which are somewhat pointed toward the poles, have a sharp double\r\ncontour, and only on artificial cultivation at a temperature of over 18 deg.\r\ndo they develop into the characteristic spore-carrying threads.\r\n\r\nThe period of incubation varies greatly, extending from three days to\r\nfour months, or even longer. In artificial inoculations with pus through\r\nwounds in the skin, inflammation and swelling of the lymph vessels may\r\nbe noticed in ten to sixty days; these vessels show in their course a\r\ndevelopment of hard nodules, from which abscesses form.\r\n\r\nThe natural infection without doubt is caused through superficial\r\nwounds, such as galls, barbed-wire cuts, or through various stable\r\nutensils, harness, bandages, insects, etc. Solipeds are mostly\r\nsusceptible, but cattle may also be infected.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The inflammation of the lymph vessels is usually first\r\nobserved on the extremities, especially on one or both hind legs; it may\r\nalso appear on the forelegs, shoulder, or neck, and more rarely on the\r\nrump, udder, and scrotum. The lesions, as a rule, develop in the tissue\r\nadjacent to the place of inoculation. In the early stages of the disease\r\nthe lymph vessels appear very hard and thickened, and along their course\r\nhard nodules develop, ranging in size from a pea to a hen's egg. Later\r\nthese nodules soften, burst spontaneously, and discharge a thick,\r\nyellowish pus. The surface of the resulting ulcers or abscess cavities\r\nsoon fills up with exuberant granulations which protrude beyond the\r\nsurface of the skin, giving it a fungoid appearance. The affected\r\nextremities are considerably enlarged, similar to cases of simple\r\nlymphangitis. In rare cases the mucous membrane of the nostrils may also\r\nbecome affected, showing yellowish flat elevations and ulcerations, and\r\nthese may extend by metastasis to internal organs. In cases in which the\r\nmucous membrane is affected, the submaxillary lymph gland may also\r\nbecome enlarged and suppurate.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional symptoms accompanying this disease are not very\r\nmarked and may be altogether absent. There is usually only a very slight\r\nfever, which seldom runs over 102 deg. F. The appetite is not impaired\r\nexcept in the advanced cases.\r\n\r\n_Lesions._--The anatomical changes are most marked in the skin and the\r\nsubcutaneous tissues. They may become 2 to 3 inches thick and indurated\r\nas the result of fibrous-tissue formation, owing to the inflammation\r\npresent. On the baconlike cut surface suppurative areas and granulating\r\nsores may be noticed of various sizes, also enlarged lymph vessels\r\nfilled with clotted lymph mixed with pus. The neighboring lymph glands\r\nare usually enlarged and frequently contain suppurating foci. Rarely the\r\ninternal organs may show metastatic abscesses.\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--The diagnosis is based on the characteristic appearance of\r\nthe ulcerations, which show exuberant granulation of a bright red color,\r\ninverted edges, and a thick, creamy, glutinous discharge. These\r\nmanifestations differentiate the disease from glanders, in which the\r\nulcers are craterlike, do contain exuberant granulations, and the\r\ndischarge is of a viscous, oily character. The submaxillary and other\r\nnodes as well as the corded lymphatics in glanders are more firmly\r\nattached to the adjacent tissues, and are therefore less movable. In\r\nsome chronic cases of sporotrichosis, however, the lesions may closely\r\nresemble those of farcy, and in these cases the microscopical\r\nexamination of the pus will disclose the nature of the affection. In the\r\npus the causative organism can be easily seen in the unstained specimen,\r\nand is recognized by its size, shape, and highly refractory double\r\noutline. Furthermore, the injection of mallein in cases of\r\nsporotrichosis will be attended with negative results.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--At the onset of the disease treatment consists in entire\r\nextirpation of the nodules, in case the lesions are localized. In cases\r\nin which the nodules have formed abscesses, their opening is\r\nrecommended, followed by the application of the actual cautery or a 1 to\r\n250 solution of bichlorid of mercury. It must be borne in mind that the\r\norganism is quite resistant to antiseptics, and the best results will be\r\nobtained from the application of a solution of a strong antiseptic\r\nfollowing the opening of the lesions. Internally, potassium iodid is\r\nrecommended in 2-dram doses, dissolved in drinking water, twice a day.\r\n\r\nIn the most favorable cases recovery results in from five to seven\r\nweeks; as a rule, however, it requires several months.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent the spreading of the disease the affected animals\r\nshould be isolated, the products of the disease should be destroyed, and\r\nthe stable should be disinfected with very strong liquid disinfectants\r\nin consideration of the resistance of the causative organism.\r\n\r\n\r\nRABIES, HYDROPHOBIA, OR MADNESS.\r\n\r\nRabies is a contagious disease, which is usually transmitted by a bite\r\nand by the introduction of a virus contained in the saliva of an\r\naffected animal. It may, however, be transmitted in other ways. It is\r\ncharacterized by symptoms of aberration of the nervous system and\r\ninvariably terminates fatally. It is accompanied with lesions,\r\ninflammation, and degeneration in the central nervous system. It is a\r\ndisease that is most common in the dog, but is transmitted to the horse,\r\neither from dogs or from any other animal affected with it. (See also\r\nremarks on page 244.) As a disease of the horse it is invariably the\r\nresult of the bite of a rabid animal, usually a dog.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no disease in medicine has been the object of more controversy\r\nthan rabies. Certain medical men of prominence have even doubted its\r\nexistence, and many others have claimed for it a spontaneous origin. The\r\nexperience of ages, however, has shown that contagion can be proved in\r\nthe great majority of cases, and, by analogy with other contagious\r\ndiseases, we may only believe that the development of one case requires\r\nthe preexistence of a case from which the virus has been transmitted.\r\nPasteur has further added to our knowledge of the disease by showing\r\nthat a virus capable of cultivation exists in the nervous system,\r\nespecially in the lower part of the brain (medulla oblongata) and in the\r\nanterior part of the spinal column. He has further shown that that\r\nportion of the nervous system which contains the virus, the exact nature\r\nof which has not yet been demonstrated, will retain it for a very long\r\ntime if kept at a very low temperature or if left surrounded by\r\ncarbolic acid; but if the nerve matter, which is virulent at first, is\r\nexposed to the air and is kept from putrefaction by substances which\r\nwill absorb the surrounding moisture, it will gradually lose its\r\nvirulence and become inoffensive in about fifteen days. He has also\r\nfurther shown that the action of a weak virus on an animal will prevent\r\nthe development of a stronger virus, and from this he has formulated his\r\nmethod of prophylactic treatment. This treatment consists in the\r\nsuccessive inoculation of portions of the nerve matter containing the\r\nvirus from a rabid animal which has been exposed to the atmosphere for\r\nthirteen days, ten days, seven days, and four days, until the virulent\r\nmatter which will produce rabies in any unprotected animal can be\r\ninoculated with impunity. A curious result of the experiments of Pasteur\r\nis that an animal which has first been inoculated with a virus of full\r\nstrength can be protected by subsequent inoculations of attenuated virus\r\nrepeated in doses of increasing strength.\r\n\r\nInnumerable attempts have been made to discover the causative agent, and\r\ninvestigators have announced the finding of many of the lower forms of\r\nanimal and vegetable life as the pathogenic factor. Among the recently\r\ndescribed causes, certain protozoanlike bodies found in the ganglionic\r\ncells in 1903 by Negri, and termed Negri bodies, are of a very\r\nsuggestive nature. Negri claims that these bodies are not only specific\r\nfor rabies, but that they are protozoa and the cause of the disease. His\r\nwork has been corroborated by investigators in all parts of the\r\nscientific world. An examination of the vitality of these bodies will\r\nshow a striking resemblance to the vitality of an emulsion of the\r\nvirulent tissue. Thus, they have been found to be quite resistant to\r\nexternal agencies, such as putrefaction, drying, etc., and are about the\r\nlast portion of the nerve cell to survive the advance of decomposition.\r\nThey are also found in more than 96 per cent of the cases of rabies\r\nexamined, but have not been proved to exist in other diseases.\r\n\r\nValenti states, as his strongest evidence of the protozoan nature of the\r\nbodies, that the virus of rabies is neutralized in test tubes by quinin,\r\nwhile no other alkaloid has this property. As a result of the work\r\nperformed in the New York City Board of Health laboratory, Park claims\r\nthat Negri bodies are found in animals before the beginning of visible\r\nsymptoms, and evidence is given that they may be found early enough to\r\naccount for the infectiousness of the central nervous system. These\r\nbodies are now almost universally considered as diagnostic of rabies,\r\nand in the pathological laboratory of the Bureau of Animal Industry\r\ntheir detection in the nerve cells of the brain suffices for a diagnosis\r\nof rabies without animal inoculations. In case these granular bodies are\r\nnot found in a suspected animal, the plexiform ganglion is next\r\nexamined, and should negative results still be obtained, the inoculation\r\nof rabbits is then made as a last resort. It is indeed rare that\r\npositive results are obtained from the latter method after the first two\r\nmethods have been negative, but it has occurred occasionally in cases in\r\nwhich the animal had been killed in the early stages of the disease.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--From the moment of inoculation by the bite of a rabid dog\r\nor other rabid animal or by other means, a variable time elapses before\r\nthe development of any symptoms. This time may be eight days or it may\r\nbe several months; it is usually about four weeks. The first symptom is\r\nan irritation of the original wound. This wound, which may have healed\r\ncompletely, commences to itch until the horse rubs or bites it into a\r\nnew sore. The horse then becomes irritable and vicious, and it is\r\nespecially susceptible to moving objects, excessive light, noises, the\r\nentrance of an attendant, or any other disturbance will cause the\r\npatient to be on the defensive. It apparently sees imaginary objects;\r\nthe slightest noise is exaggerated into threatening violence; the\r\napproach of an attendant or another animal, especially a dog, is\r\ninterpreted as an assault and the horse will strike and bite. The\r\nviolence on the part of the rabid horse is not for a moment to be\r\nconfounded with the fury of the same animal suffering from meningitis or\r\nany other trouble of the brain. But in rabies there is a volition, a\r\npremeditated method, in the attacks which the animal will make, which is\r\nnot found in the other diseases. Between the attacks of fury the animal\r\nmay become calm for a variable period. The writer attended a case in\r\nwhich, after a violent attack of an hour, the horse was sufficiently\r\ncalm to be walked 10 miles and only developed violence again an hour\r\nafter being placed in the new stable. In the period of fury the horse\r\nwill bite at the reopened original wound; it will rear and attempt to\r\nbreak its halter and fastenings; it will bite at the woodwork and\r\nsurrounding objects in the stable. If the animal lives long enough it\r\nshows paralytic symptoms and falls to the ground, unable to use two or\r\nmore of its extremities, but in the majority of cases in its excesses of\r\nviolence it does physical injury to itself. It breaks its jaws in biting\r\nat the manger or fractures other bones in throwing itself on the ground\r\nand dies of hemorrhage or internal injuries. At times throughout the\r\ncourse of the disease there is an excessive sensibility of the skin\r\nwhich, if irritated by the touch, will bring on attacks of violence.\r\nThroughout the course of the disease the animal may have appetite and\r\ndesire water, but on attempting to swallow has a spasm of the throat\r\nwhich renders the act impossible. This latter condition, which is common\r\nin all rabid animals, has given the disease the name of hydrophobia\r\n(fear of water).\r\n\r\nIn a case under the care of the writer a horse, four weeks after being\r\nbitten on the forearm by a rabid dog, developed local irritation in the\r\nhealed wound and tore it with its teeth into a large ulcer. This was\r\nhealed by local treatment in 10 days, and the horse was kept under\r\nsurveillance for more than a month. On the advice of another\r\npractitioner the horse was taken home and put to work; within 3 days it\r\ndeveloped violent symptoms and had to be destroyed.\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--The diagnosis of rabies in the horse is to be made from\r\nthe various brain troubles to which the animal is subject; first by the\r\nhistory of a previous bite of a rabid animal or inoculation by other\r\nmeans; second, by the evident volition and consciousness on the part of\r\nthe animal in its attacks, offensive and defensive, on persons, animals,\r\nor other disturbing surroundings. The irritation and reopening of the\r\noriginal wound or point of inoculation is a valuable factor in\r\ndiagnosis. Diagnosis after death may be made by microscopic examination\r\nfor Negri bodies or by the inoculation of rabbits, as already mentioned.\r\n\r\nRecovery from rabies may be considered as a question of the correctness\r\nof the original diagnosis. Rabies is always fatal.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--No remedial treatment has ever been successful. All the\r\nanodynes and anesthetics, opium, belladonna, bromid of potash, ether,\r\nchloroform, etc., have been used without avail. The prophylactic\r\ntreatment of successive inoculations is being used on human beings, and\r\nhas experimentally proved efficacious in dogs, but would be\r\nimpracticable in the horse unless the conditions were quite exceptional.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOURINE.\r\n\r\nBy JOHN R. MOHLER, V. M. D., _Assistant Chief, Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry_.\r\n\r\nDourine (also known as maladie du coit, equine syphilis, covering\r\ndisease, breeding paralysis) is a specific infectious disease affecting\r\nunder normal conditions only the horse and ass, transmitted from animal\r\nto animal by the act of copulation, and due to an animal parasite, the\r\n_Trypanosoma equiperdum_.\r\n\r\n_History._--It is described as having existed as early as 1796 in the\r\nEastern Hemisphere, and was more or less prevalent in several of the\r\nEuropean countries, including France, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland,\r\nduring the first half of the nineteenth century. Its presence was\r\nrecognized for the first time in the United States in 1886, when an\r\noutbreak occurred in Illinois. Since then the existence of the disease\r\nhas been observed at irregular intervals in numerous other States,\r\nincluding Nebraska, Iowa, Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico, North Dakota,\r\nand South Dakota.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--There are many variations in the symptoms of dourine, and\r\nthis is particularly true of the disease as it occurs in this country.\r\nTwo distinct stages may be noted which vary somewhat from those\r\ndescribed in textbooks, but probably no more than could be expected when\r\ndifferences of climatic conditions and methods of handling are taken\r\ninto consideration.\r\n\r\nThe first stage chiefly concerns the sexual organs and therefore differs\r\nsomewhat in the male and female. In the second stage the symptoms\r\nindicating an affection of the nervous system are more prominent and are\r\nnot dependent upon the sex of the animal.\r\n\r\nFollowing a variable period of incubation of from 8 days to 2 months,\r\nthere is seen in the stallion an irritation and swelling about the penis\r\nand sheath. In a few days small vesicles or blisters may appear on the\r\npenis, which later break, discharging a yellowish, serous fluid and\r\nhaving irregular, raw ulcers. The ulcers show a tendency to heal\r\nrapidly, leaving scars which are permanent. There may be more or less\r\ncontinuous dripping from the urethra of a yellowish, serouslike fluid.\r\nStallions may show great excitement when brought in the vicinity of\r\nmares, but service is often impossible because of the fact that a\r\ncomplete erection of the penis does not occur.\r\n\r\nIn the mare the first symptoms may be so slight as to be overlooked. The\r\ndisease, being the result of copulation, usually begins with\r\ninflammation of the vulva and vagina. There may be a mucopurulent\r\ndischarge, which may be slight or profuse in quantity, agglutinating the\r\nhairs of the tail. The mare may appear uneasy and urinate frequently.\r\nVesicles may appear on the external vulva and mucous membrane of the\r\nvulva and vagina which later rupture and form ulcers. On the dark skin\r\nof the external vulva the scars resulting from healing of the ulcers are\r\nwhite, more or less circular in outline, from one-eighth to half an inch\r\nin diameter, and pitlike. This depigmentation of the skin about the\r\nexternal genitals is permanent.\r\n\r\nUrticarial eruptions or plaques which break out over various parts of\r\nthe body are a frequent symptom seen in animals of either sex. These are\r\nsharply defined and edematous swellings of the skin about the size of a\r\nhalf dollar or may be even larger. The usual locations of these plaques\r\nare the croup, belly, and neck.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of the symptoms mentioned which are significant of the\r\nearly stage of the disease may vary to a wide extent and in many\r\ninstances be so mild as to escape the attention of any but the most\r\ncareful observer. They commonly disappear after a brief period. The\r\napparent recovery, however, is not permanent, for such animals after a\r\nperiod of variable length manifest constitutional or nervous symptoms.\r\nThese may not appear for several months or even years. They consist of a\r\ngeneral nervous disorder with staggering, swaying gait, especially in\r\nthe hind limbs. The animal generally becomes emaciated, the abdomen\r\nassuming a tucked-up appearance. The first indication of paralysis will\r\nbe noted in traveling, when the animal fails to pick up one of the hind\r\nfeet as freely as the other, or both may become affected at the same\r\ntime, at which time knuckling is a common symptom. Labored breathing is\r\noccasionally noted. When the paralysis of the hind limbs starts to\r\nappear the disease usually progresses rapidly. The horse goes down, is\r\nunable to rise, and dies in a short time from nervous exhaustion. The\r\nappetite usually remains good up to the last.\r\n\r\nAlthough a case of dourine may now and then recover, as a rule the\r\ndisease is present in the latent stage. Bad weather, exposure,\r\ninsufficient feed, and complicating diseases like influenza, distemper,\r\nor in fact any condition which tends to lower the vitality of the\r\nanimal, may hasten the termination of the disease.\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--The complement-fixation test furnishes by far the most\r\nreliable means of diagnosis and is especially valuable in a chronic\r\naffection of this character, when the symptoms manifested are variable\r\nand frequently so obscure as to escape observation. This is a laboratory\r\ntest requiring special facilities and the services of a trained\r\nbacteriologist.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Little benefit can be obtained from medicinal treatment,\r\nnor is such treatment desirable in this country, where the disease has\r\nexisted only in restricted areas, and where sanitary considerations\r\ndemand its prompt eradication.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFECTIOUS ABORTION IN MARES.\r\n\r\nInfectious abortion (also known as contagious abortion, epizootic\r\nabortion, enzootic abortion, slinking of colts) is a disease of mares\r\nwhich from a specific cause results in the premature expulsion of the\r\nfetus and its membranes from the uterus. It is characterized by an\r\ninflammatory condition of the female reproductive organs.\r\n\r\nThe contagious nature of the disease had not been recognized until\r\nrecently, the disease being principally attributed to various\r\nconditions, such as traumatic influences, various infectious diseases,\r\nspoiled feed, drugs, and other factors. Ostertag was the first to study\r\npremature births in mares, attributing as the cause of the same a\r\nstreptococcus, which he was supposed to have been able to use\r\nsuccessfully in artificially producing abortion, either by inoculations\r\nor feeding. His findings could not be substantiated by other\r\ninvestigators.\r\n\r\nThe earliest appearance of the disease in this country was in 1886, at\r\nwhich time it caused considerable damage to the horse-breeding industry\r\nin the Mississippi Valley. Smith and Kilbourne investigated an outbreak\r\nin Pennsylvania in 1893, at which time they incriminated another germ\r\nbelonging to the paratyphus B group as the causative factor of the\r\ndisease. These findings have been subsequently substantiated by many\r\ninvestigators abroad, as well as in this country, notably so by De Jong,\r\nDassonville, and Riviere, and by Good and Meyer. More recently very\r\nvaluable information was contributed to our knowledge on this disease by\r\nSchofield, of Canada, especially with regard to the biological tests for\r\ndiagnosis. Good suggested \"_Bacillus abortivus equinus_\" as the name for\r\nthe specific organism.\r\n\r\nThe causative agent of this disease is not identical with the germ\r\ncausing abortion in cattle. It exerts its action, however, in a similar\r\nmanner, and appears to have, under certain conditions, a predilection\r\nfor the genital organs of the mare, where it induces certain morbid\r\nchanges whereby a premature expulsion of the fetus is the result. The\r\ngerm is usually present in the fetal membranes and also in the aborted\r\nfetus. Mares may harbor the infection without disclosing any apparent\r\nill effects. It appears to exert its influence mainly upon the female\r\ngenital organs, where it may induce an inflammatory condition of the\r\nuterus.\r\n\r\nThe infected animals may carry the fetus through the normal period of\r\npregnancy, giving birth to either a normal or a weak colt, or again\r\nabortion may take place at any time during pregnancy, mostly, however,\r\nfrom the sixth to the ninth month.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms suggestive of abortion are frequently entirely\r\nabsent. At times the abortion may be ushered in by symptoms of colicky\r\npains, restlessness, and periodical straining; these, however, are by no\r\nmeans constant, especially if the abortion takes place in the early\r\nmonths of pregnancy. The genital organs are usually swollen, showing a\r\nmucous discharge. Immediately before abortion the symptoms are more\r\naggravated. Following abortion the discharge is more characteristic,\r\nbeing of a dark-brown color, sometimes even bloody, and contains streaky\r\nor flaky pus. The fetal membranes in all cases are not expelled with the\r\naborted fetus, but there is a tendency toward retention of these\r\nmembranes, which frequently has serious consequences upon the health of\r\nthe animal. At times it becomes necessary to resort to manual removal of\r\nthe afterbirth, and the inflammation of the uterus and a chronic\r\ndischarge usually follow such conditions. The expelled fetuses, as a\r\nrule, die soon after the abortion, and if the expulsion has taken place\r\nat a time close to its full term the fetuses are usually poorly\r\ndeveloped and subject to various kinds of digestive and septic\r\ndisorders. The fetuses do not disclose any particular abnormal\r\nappearance on external examination; in many cases, however, the\r\npost-mortem examination reveals inflammatory changes of various organs.\r\n\r\nThe method of infection has not yet been satisfactorily established;\r\nnevertheless it is essential that we consider as the principal mode of\r\ninfection the ways which have been proved for the contagious abortion\r\nin cattle. These are especially by ingestion; that is, by taking up the\r\ngerms with the feed, water, or other means, which have become\r\ncontaminated with the germs. The infection through the genital organs is\r\nprobably not so frequent, but in this regard the stallion no doubt plays\r\nan important role in the spreading of the disease. Schofield considers\r\nthis method of infection as the principal source of spreading the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nIt must be considered that in infected stables the germs may be present\r\nthroughout the premises, and by keeping animals which have aborted in\r\nsuch stables a contamination of feed and utensils may continually take\r\nplace, since the aborted mares usually discharge a considerable quantity\r\nof material which is often heavily charged with the germs. The germ is\r\ntaken up by the body with the feed or water, passing from the intestines\r\ninto the blood, and from there is carried to the genital organs, where\r\nit finds suitable conditions for its development. Milk from an infected\r\nmare may also contain the germ, and colts may become infected by sucking\r\nthe milk of infected mothers. In such instances the infection may remain\r\ndormant until the colt develops and becomes pregnant, when the organism,\r\nfinding a condition suitable for its development, produces the disease.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, stallions used in covering infected mares may be\r\ncarriers of the germs, and when used for the breeding of healthy animals\r\nmay in this manner readily transmit the disease to them.\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--Contagious abortion may be diagnosed by the changes which\r\noccur in the fetal membranes, and also in the expelled feces. In order,\r\nhowever, to substantiate a diagnosis with certainty, demonstration of\r\nthe germ by microscopical examination is necessary. The occurrence of\r\nfrequent abortions among the mares in a stable is also an additional\r\nevidence of the contagious character of the malady. It must be\r\nconsidered that at times infected mares may carry the fetus to full\r\nmaturity, in which case the diagnosis is possible only by blood\r\nexaminations in a laboratory.\r\n\r\nInfected animals usually abort only once; however, in a certain\r\nproportion of cases they may abort even two, three, or four times in\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\nAnimals which establish a tolerance for the infection, and carry the\r\nfetus to full maturity, may nevertheless remain a source of danger for\r\nspreading the disease.\r\n\r\nThe tests used in laboratories for the diagnosis are the agglutination\r\nand complement-fixation tests, by which the disease may be diagnosed\r\nfrom a sample of blood from a suspected animal. Such tests, however,\r\nhave to be confined to the laboratories, which are equipped for such\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n_Treatment and prevention._--Medicinal treatment is usually of no avail,\r\nand all efforts should be directed toward the prevention of the\r\ndisease. Various medicinal agents have been recommended and are being\r\nexploited for the treatment, but to the present time no satisfactory\r\nevidence has been established as to their merits. Bacterial vaccines\r\nprepared from the specific organism have been given limited trials, but\r\nto date they can not be considered as entirely satisfactory, since it\r\nwill require considerable experience with them before their usefulness\r\ncan be definitely established.\r\n\r\nThe prevention should consist largely in sanitary measures directed\r\ntoward the disinfection of premises and animals. (For a method for\r\ndisinfection of premises see article under that heading.)\r\n\r\nThe following procedure is advised for the disinfection of animals: To\r\nprevent a stallion from carrying the infection from a diseased mare to a\r\nhealthy one the sheath and the penis should be disinfected with a\r\nsolution of 1/2 per cent of compound cresol solution, lysol, or\r\ntrikresol, or a 1 per cent carbolic acid or 1 to 1,000 potassium\r\npermanganate solution in warm water. For this purpose it is advisable to\r\nuse a soft-rubber tube with a large funnel attached to one end, or an\r\nordinary syringe and tube would serve the purpose. The tube should be\r\ninserted into the sheath, and the foreskin held with the hand to prevent\r\nthe immediate escape of the fluid. In addition to this the hair of the\r\nbelly and inner side of the thighs should be sponged with an antiseptic.\r\nThis disinfection should invariably precede and follow every service.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the mares, a period of three months should elapse between\r\nabortion and a subsequent breeding, and especially if there is any\r\nevidence of a discharge the breeding of the animal should not be\r\nundertaken. The mare showing signs of abortion should be immediately\r\nisolated and the fetus and membranes should be burned. The fetus should\r\nnever be dragged across a barnyard or stable, but should be removed by\r\nother means by which the contamination of the premises may be prevented.\r\nThe stall in which the animal aborted should be thoroughly disinfected\r\nand the genital organs of the mare washed daily with a disinfectant. The\r\nantiseptic washing recommended for the treatment of the stallions prior\r\nto and after breeding should be also used for the irrigation of the\r\nuterus of mares which have aborted. This treatment should be continued\r\ndaily until all evidence of discharge has ceased. The isolation of the\r\nanimal should be carried out for at least one month after the evidence\r\nof a discharge has ceased.\r\n\r\nBy carefully and persistently carrying out the sanitary measures it may\r\nbe possible to control and finally eradicate the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAVEL ILL OF COLTS.\r\n\r\nNavel ill of colts is also known as joint ill, omphalophlebitis, septic\r\narthritis of sucklings, and pyosepticemia of the newly born. The\r\nunfavorable outlook after the appearance of the disease, together with\r\nthe fact that the disease when present requires the attention of a\r\nveterinarian, demands that the breeder concern himself with its\r\nprevention.\r\n\r\nThe disease is caused by a microorganism and several bacteria have been\r\nsuspected of being responsible. Every one of the suspected organisms is\r\nfound abundantly in manure and objects contaminated with manure. The\r\ninfective material gains entrance into the colt through the open\r\numbilical cord as a result of its coming into contact with litter,\r\nfloors, or discharges from its dam contaminated by one of the organisms\r\nwhich cause the trouble. There are cases on record in which the\r\ninfection has taken place before birth, and while some investigators\r\nassert that this method is the principal mode of infection still, in a\r\nlarge number of cases, the prophylactic measures adopted to guard\r\nagainst the infection through the navel cord have given good results.\r\nSince infection before birth can not be controlled satisfactorily, we\r\nare justified, for all practical purposes, in preventing navel ill by\r\nguarding against the infection through the cord at birth or soon\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nCleanliness of stables where pregnant mares are kept must be insisted\r\nupon. This is especially necessary where outbreaks of navel ill have\r\nbeen known to exist. Mares in the last stages of gestation should be\r\nplaced in a box stall which has previously been cleaned and disinfected.\r\nThe bedding should be frequently renewed and the external genitals and\r\nneighboring tissues should be kept clean and disinfected with a 2 per\r\ncent solution of carbolic acid or 1 per cent liquor cresolis compositus,\r\nor any other reliable disinfecting agent. Operations for opening\r\nabscesses and removal of afterbirths from cows should not be executed in\r\nthe immediate vicinity of mares in an advanced stage of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThe foal when dropped should be placed on clean bedding. In any event\r\nthe cord of the foal should be washed in a disinfectant solution and\r\ntied at about 1-1/2 inches from the navel with a band or string which\r\nhas previously been soaked in a disinfectant solution. With a sharp pair\r\nof scissors the navel cord is then severed about one-half inch below the\r\nband and again disinfected. The ligature should not be tightened,\r\nhowever, until pulsation of the vessels in the cord has ceased. The\r\nstump of the cord is then painted with strong carbolic-acid solution,\r\ntincture of iodin, or a mixture of equal parts of tincture of iodin and\r\nglycerin. The stump should be washed daily with a disinfectant and\r\neither painted with iodin mixture or carbolic acid or dusted with some\r\nreliable antiseptic healing powder. After five days the parchmentlike\r\ndried stump may be cut off and the navel wound washed with a\r\ndisinfectant solution and dusted with powder until healed.\r\n\r\nThe cases of navel ill resulting from infection before birth can not\r\nwell be guarded against. By keeping mares, advanced in pregnancy, in\r\ngood physical condition, the fetus will be expelled immediately upon the\r\nopening of the uterine cavity.\r\n\r\nOnce the infection of the navel cord has set in, the cord should not be\r\nligated but should be washed in a disinfectant solution and a\r\nveterinarian called for the subsequent treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFECTIOUS ANEMIA OR SWAMP FEVER.\r\n\r\nBy JOHN R. MOHLER, V. M. D., _Assistant Chief, Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry_.\r\n\r\nInfectious anemia of horses, known also by a number of other names, as\r\nswamp fever, American surra, malarial fever, typhoid fever of horses,\r\nthe unknown disease, no-name disease, plains paralysis, and pernicious\r\nanemia, has recently been the subject of much investigation. The cause\r\nof the disease has now been definitely determined as an invisible virus,\r\nwhich is capable of passing through the pores of the finest porcelain\r\nfilters, like the infection of foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest, hog\r\ncholera, and similar diseases. The disease is most prevalent in\r\nlow-lying and badly drained sections of the country, although it has\r\nbeen found on marshy pastures during wet seasons in altitudes as high as\r\n7,500 feet. Therefore proper drainage of infected pastures is indicated\r\nas a preventive. It is also more prevalent during wet years than in dry\r\nseasons. It usually makes its appearance in June and increases in\r\nfrequency until October, although the chronic cases may be seen in the\r\nwinter, having been contracted during the warm season.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--It has been conclusively proved that infectious anemia is\r\nproduced by an invisible filterable organism which is transmissible to\r\nhorses, mules, and asses by subcutaneous inoculation of blood serum. The\r\nvirus which is present in the blood may be transmitted to a number of\r\nequines in a series of inoculations by injecting either the whole blood,\r\nthe defibrinated blood, or the blood serum which has been passed through\r\na fine Pasteur filter, thus eliminating all the visible forms of\r\norganismal life, including bacteria, trypanosoma, piroplasma, etc. This\r\nvirus has also been found to be active in the carcass of an affected\r\nanimal 24 hours after death.\r\n\r\nFollowing the injection of the infectious principle there is a period of\r\nincubation which may extend from ten days to one and one-half months, at\r\nthe end of which time the onset of the disease is manifested by a rise\r\nof temperature. If uncomplicated, the infection runs a chronic course,\r\nterminating in death in from two months to one and one-half years, or\r\neven longer. The probability of the virus being spread by an\r\nintermediate host, such as flies, mosquitoes, internal parasites, etc.,\r\nis now receiving careful investigation.\r\n\r\nFrom experiments already conducted it appears that this disease,\r\nformerly supposed to be confined to Manitoba and Minnesota, is more or\r\nless prevalent in Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, North\r\nDakota, Virginia, Texas, and New York. It also occurs in Europe, having\r\nbeen reported in Germany under the name of infectious anemia and in\r\nFrance as infectious typho-anemia.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The disease is characterized by a progressive pernicious\r\nanemia, remittent fever, polyuria, and gradual emaciation in spite of a\r\nvoracious appetite. It begins to manifest itself by a dull, listless\r\nappearance and by general weakness, the animal tiring very easily. This\r\nstage is followed closely by a staggering, swaying, uncertain gait, the\r\nhind legs being mostly affected. There is also noted a weakness and\r\ntenderness in the region of the loins, and at the same time the pulse,\r\nthough weak, stringy, and intermittent, increases in rapidity and may\r\nrun as high as 70. The temperature may rise to 103 deg. F. or higher,\r\nremaining high for several days, and then dropping to rise again\r\nirregularly. Toward the end of the disease the temperature occasionally\r\nremains persistently high. The horse may improve for a time, but usually\r\nthis improvement is followed by a more severe attack than the first.\r\nVenous regurgitation is sometimes noticed in the jugular before death.\r\nThe quantity of urine passed is enormous in some cases. Death finally\r\noccurs from exhaustion or syncope.\r\n\r\nThe blood shows a slight decrease in the number of white blood cells,\r\nwhile there is a gradual but marked diminution of red corpuscles, the\r\ncount running as low as 2,000,000 per cubic millimeter, the normal count\r\nbeing 7,000,000. If the blood is drawn from such an animal, the\r\nresulting red clot will be about one-fifth of the amount drawn.\r\nOccasionally a slow dripping of blood-tinged serum from the nostrils is\r\nobserved as a result of this very thin blood oozing from the mucous\r\nmembranes. Petechiae, or small hemorrhagic points, are sometimes noticed\r\non the nictitating membrane and conjunctiva, while paleness of the\r\nvisible mucous membranes of the nose and mouth is usually in evidence,\r\nalthough they may have a yellow or mahogany tinge. Often a fluctuating,\r\npendulous swelling may appear on the lower lip, point of elbow, sheath,\r\nlegs, under the belly, or on some other pendent portion, especially late\r\nin the disease, which is indicative of poor circulation, thinning of the\r\nblood, and consequent loss of capillary action.\r\n\r\n_Lesions._--After death the carcass is found to be very much emaciated\r\nand anemic, the visible mucosa being very pale. This marked absence of\r\nadipose tissue makes the skinning of the animal a difficult task.\r\nSubcutaneous and intermuscular edema and hemorrhages are frequently\r\nobserved, although in many cases it is remarkable to see how few\r\nmacroscopic lesions may be present. The predominating and most constant\r\nlesion is probably the petechiae, so often observed in the muscle or on\r\nthe serous membranes of the heart. The heart is generally enlarged and\r\nmay be the only organ to show evidence of disease. In other cases the\r\nlungs may be studded with petechiae, with a serous exudate present in the\r\nthoracic cavity. In addition to the petechiae already noted, the\r\npericardial sac generally contains an increased quantity of fluid. The\r\nabdominal cavity may show peritonitis and a hemorrhagic condition of the\r\nintestines, which probably result from overfeeding in consequence of the\r\nravenous appetite. The liver, although usually normal, sometimes\r\npresents a few areas of degeneration. The spleen is at times found to be\r\nenlarged and covered with petechiae. The kidneys may appear normal or\r\nanemic and flaccid, but microscopically they usually show a chronic\r\nparenchymatous degeneration. The lymph glands may be enlarged and\r\nhemorrhagic.\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--The diagnosis of the disease is not difficult, especially\r\nin advanced stages. The insidious onset, remittent fever, progressive\r\nemaciation and anemia, unimpaired or ravenous appetite, staggering gait\r\nand polyuria are a train of symptoms which make the disease sufficiently\r\ncharacteristic to differentiate it from other diseases affecting horses\r\nin this country. The peculiar relapsing type of fever, the great\r\nreduction in the number of red blood cells, and the absence of\r\neosinophila are sufficient to differentiate it from the anemias produced\r\nby internal parasites, while it may be readily distinguished from surra\r\nby the nonsusceptibility of cattle and by the great ease with which the\r\ntrypanosoma may be found in the latter affection.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis._--The prognosis of the disease is very unfavorable.\r\nVeterinarians in different sections of the country where it is prevalent\r\nreport a mortality of 75 per cent or even higher. Recovery takes place\r\nonly when treatment is begun early or when the animal has a long\r\nconvalescent period.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment of the disease has so far been far from\r\nsatisfactory. The iodid, permanganate, and carbonate of potash have been\r\nused. Arsenic, axytol, quinin, and silver preparations have been\r\nsuggested, but all have been uniformly without success. Intestinal\r\nantiseptics have been resorted to, and the results are encouraging but\r\nnot altogether satisfactory. Symptomatic treatment seems to be the most\r\ndependable. For instance, Davison, of this bureau, was able to reduce\r\ngreatly the mortality from this affection by giving an antipyretic of 40\r\ngrains of quinin, 2 drams of acetanilid, and 30 grains of powdered nux\r\nvomica four times daily. In the late stages, with weak heart action,\r\nalcohol should be substituted for acetanilid. Cold-water sponge baths\r\nmay be given, and in addition frequent copious injections of cold water\r\nper rectum, which has a beneficial effect in reducing the temperature\r\nand in stimulating peristalsis of the bowels, which, as a result of the\r\ndisease, show a tendency to become torpid during the fever. Purgatives,\r\non account of their debilitating effect, should not be given unless\r\nabsolutely necessary, but laxatives and easily digested feeds should be\r\ngiven instead. Not infrequently a dirty yellowish tinge of the visible\r\nmucous membranes has been observed, in which cases 20 grains of calomel\r\nin from 2 to 4 drams of aloes in a ball, or 2-dram doses of fluid\r\nextract of podophyllin, may be given. Following the subsidence of the\r\nfever, a tonic should be administered, composed of the following drugs\r\nin combination:\r\n\r\n    Arsenious acid            grams       2\r\n    Powdered nux vomica         do       28\r\n    Powdered cinchona bark      do       85\r\n    Powdered gentian root       do      110\r\n\r\nThese should be well mixed and one-half teaspoonful given to the\r\naffected animal at each feed.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of all other infectious diseases, the healthy should be\r\nseparated from the sick horses and thorough disinfection of the infected\r\nstables, stalls, litter, and stable utensils should be carried out in\r\norder to prevent the recurrence of the disease. As a disinfectant the\r\ncompound solution of cresol, carbolic acid, or chlorid of lime may be\r\nused, by mixing 6 ounces of any one of these chemicals with 1 gallon of\r\nwater. One of the approved coal-tar sheep dips may also be used to\r\nadvantage in a 5 per cent solution (6 ounces of dip to 1 gallon of\r\nwater). The disinfectant solution should be applied liberally to all\r\nparts of the stable, and sufficient lime may be added to the solution to\r\nmake the disinfected area conspicious.\r\n\r\nInvestigations are now in progress with a view of producing a vaccine or\r\nserum that will protect horses that have been exposed to the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nSURRA.\r\n\r\nBy CH. WARDELL STILES, PH. D.\r\n\r\n_Professor of Zoology, United States Public Health Service._\r\n\r\nSurra is not known to occur in the United States, but it is more or less\r\ncommon in the Philippine Islands and India. It is caused by a\r\nmicroscopic, flagellate animal parasite, known as _Trypanosoma evansi_,\r\n20 to 34  mu long by 1 to 2  mu broad, which lives in the blood and destroys\r\nthe red blood corpuscles. In general the disease is very similar to and\r\nbelongs in the same general class with tsetse-fly disease, or nagana, of\r\nAfrica and mal de caderas, of South America.\r\n\r\nSurra is a wet-weather disease, occurring chiefly during or immediately\r\nafter heavy rainfalls, floods, or inundations.\r\n\r\nSurra attacks especially horses, asses, and mules, but it may occur in\r\ncarabao, camels, elephants, cats, and dogs, and has been transmitted to\r\ncattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats, rabbits, guinea pigs, rats, and\r\nmonkeys. No birds, reptiles, amphibia (frogs, etc.), or fish are known\r\nto suffer from it. It attacks both male and female animals, young and\r\nold. Australian breeds of horses and white and gray mules are said to be\r\nmore susceptible than animals of other breeds and color.\r\n\r\nSurra in equines and camels is said to be an invariably fatal disease,\r\nbut cattle occasionally recover from it. There is no history of a\r\ndefinite onset of the disease, and the condition is progressive, usually\r\nwith a number of relapses. The period of incubation may vary somewhat;\r\nin experimental cases it is from 2 to 75 (usually 6 to 8) days,\r\naccording to conditions. The duration varies with the species of animal\r\nattacked, their age, and general condition. The average duration in the\r\nhorse is reported at less than two months, though some cases may\r\nterminate fatally in less than one to two weeks.\r\n\r\n_Method of infection._--All evidence now available seems to indicate\r\nthat surra is strictly a wound disease, namely, that the parasite may\r\nenter the body only through a wound of some kind. Apparently by far the\r\nmost common method is through wounds produced by biting flies whose\r\nmouth parts are moist with the infected blood of some animal bitten by\r\nthe same flies immediately before biting the healthy animal. Crows may\r\nalso transmit the infection by pecking at sores on a diseased animal,\r\nsoiling their beaks with blood, and transferring this infected blood to\r\na healthy animal. Likewise, if a scratch is made on a horse and then\r\ninfected blood is rubbed on the scratch, the horse will become diseased.\r\nIf, in experiment, infected blood is fed to a healthy animal, the latter\r\nmay contract surra in case it has an abraded or wounded spot in the\r\nmouth; but if no part of the lining of the alimentary canal is wounded,\r\ninfection does not take place. Thus dogs and cats may contract the\r\ndisease by wounding the lining of the mouth (as with splinters of bone)\r\nwhile feeding on the carcasses of surra subjects. All available evidence\r\nindicates that under normal conditions of pregnancy the disease is not\r\ntransmitted from mother to fetus.\r\n\r\nThere is a popular view that surra may be contracted by drinking\r\nstagnant water and by eating grass and other vegetation grown upon land\r\nsubject to inundation, but there is no good experimental evidence to\r\nsupport this view: Probably the correct interpretation of the facts\r\ncited in support of this theory is that biting flies are numerous around\r\nstagnant water and in inundated pastures; hence, that a great number of\r\npossible transmitters of the disease are present in these places.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._[7]--The invasion of this disease when contracted naturally\r\nis usually marked by symptoms of a trivial character; the skin feels\r\nhot, and there may be more or less fever; there is also slight loss of\r\nappetite, and the animal appears dull and stumbles during action; early\r\na symptom sometimes appears which may be the first intimation of the\r\nanimal's indisposition, and which, as a guide to diagnosis, is of great\r\nimportance; it is the presence of a general or localized urticarial\r\neruption. If the blood is examined microscopically, it may be found to\r\npresent a normal appearance; but in the majority of cases a few small,\r\nrapidly moving organisms will be observed, giving to the blood, as it\r\npasses among the corpuscles, a peculiar, vibrating movement, which if\r\nonce observed will not easily be forgotten. If the parasite has not been\r\ndiscovered in the blood for several days, the symptoms mentioned above\r\nmay be the only ones noticed, and, as a rule, when treated with\r\nfebrifuges, the horse quickly improves in health and the appetite\r\nreturns. This condition does not last for more than a few days, when the\r\nanimal is again observed to present a dull and dejected appearance, and\r\non examination well-marked symptoms are found; the skin is hot, the\r\ntemperature more or less elevated--101.7 deg. to 104 deg. F.; the pulse full and\r\nfrequent--56 to 64 beats a minute; the visible mucous membranes may\r\nappear clean, but the conjunctival membranes, especially those covering\r\nthe membrana nictitans, are usually the seat of dark-red patches of\r\necchymosis, varying in size in different animals. There is more or less\r\nthirst and slight loss of appetite; the animal eats its grain and green\r\ngrass, but leaves all or a portion of the hay with which it has been\r\nsupplied. At the same time there are slight catarrhal symptoms present,\r\nincluding lacrimation and a little mucous discharge from the nostrils.\r\nOccasionally at this period of the disease the submaxillary glands may\r\nbe found enlarged and perhaps somewhat tender on manipulation. One\r\nsymptom is markedly absent, namely, the presence of rigors or the\r\nobjective sign of chilliness. In addition, it will be noted that there\r\nis some swelling and edema of the legs, generally between the fetlock\r\nand the hock, which pits but is not painful on pressure, and in case of\r\nhorses there may be also some swelling of the sheath at this stage of\r\nthe disease. When the fever and concomitant symptoms have declared\r\nthemselves for a short period, one thing becomes especially noticeable\r\nin every animal attacked, namely, the rapidity with which it loses\r\nflesh. If the blood has been examined microscopically during the second\r\nperiod of fever, at first a few parasites will have been observed in it,\r\nwhich day by day increase in number and reach a maximum, where they\r\nremain for a varying period, or at once suddenly or gradually disappear\r\nduring the period of apyrexia. After the fever and the accompanying\r\nsymptoms have for the second time been present for a few days--the\r\nperiod varying from one to six--the animal is found to have lost the\r\ndull, dejected appearance and to look bright. The temperature has fallen\r\nand, in some cases, has attained normal or even subnormal limits. The\r\nvisible mucous membranes are clean, and the conjunctival petechiae begin\r\nto fade; the pulse, however, will be found to be weak and thready in\r\ncharacter, but the appetite excellent, and, in fact, if it were not for\r\nthe loss of flesh and slight edema of the legs, there would be little to\r\nshow that the animal was sick. Unfortunately, however, this condition\r\ndoes not continue for any great length of time, for again the\r\ntemperature is elevated; in the course of a few hours the thermometer\r\nregisters a still higher degree, the animal is dull and dejected, and by\r\nthe following day the visible mucous membranes present a yellow tinge;\r\nlarge ecchymoses, dark in color, appear on the conjunctival membranes,\r\nthe action of the heart is irritable, the pulse full and quick, or at\r\ntimes intermittent, and regurgitation may be observed in the jugulars,\r\nthe breathing is quickened, and the individual respirations are shallow.\r\nOn watching an animal in this condition it may be noticed that it takes\r\nseven or eight very short inspirations, followed by a much more\r\nprolonged and sonorous one; at the same time the breathing is more\r\nabdominal than thoracic in character. On examination of the legs it will\r\nbe found that the swelling and edema have increased considerably, and\r\nthat on the under surface of the abdomen, where previously it was\r\nconfined to the sheath, it has now commenced to spread forward along the\r\nsubcutaneous tissue between the skin and the muscles. During the whole\r\nof this time the appetite will have varied little, and the evacuations\r\nwill be only slightly, if at all, altered in character. In the blood a\r\nrepetition of the previous events takes place, the parasites make their\r\nappearance and increase to a maximum and again suddenly or gradually\r\ndisappear, according to the length of the fever period. These periods,\r\nalternating with and without fever, may go on for a considerable time.\r\nThe progress of the disease is variable and greatly depends upon the\r\ncondition of the animal attacked, the weak one succumbing very rapidly,\r\nbut each return of the fever brings with it, as a rule, an increase in\r\nthe severity of the symptoms. There is increased yellowness of the\r\nmembranes, fresh crops of petechiae on the conjunctiva, a collection of\r\ngelatinous material at the inner angle, which at times becomes red in\r\ncolor from an admixture of blood, and which on microscopic examination\r\nis found to contain a varying number of the surra parasites; increased\r\nswelling and edema of the extremities and abdomen, which now extends\r\nbetween the fore limbs and up the chest. During this time the wasting\r\nhas been steadily progressive, especially of the muscles of the back and\r\nthose surrounding the hip joint and the glutei.\r\n\r\nToward the termination of the disease it will be noticed that an animal\r\nis disinclined to move, and when made to do so there is manifest loss of\r\npower over the hind quarters, somewhat simulating a slight partial\r\nparalysis, and the hind quarters of the animal reel from side to side.\r\nIn connection with this it may be noted that frequently there is\r\nparalysis of the sphincter ani and a dilated condition of the anus.\r\nThese symptoms taken together point to some interference with the normal\r\nfunctions of the spinal cord in the lower dorsal and lumbar regions, and\r\nare probably owing to pressure caused by an exudation within the spinal\r\nmembranes. In many cases shortly before death the heart's action becomes\r\nexceedingly violent, shaking the whole frame at each beat, so that the\r\nsound can be heard at some distance from the animal. In some of these\r\ncases the animal may suddenly drop dead; in others the emaciation and\r\nweakness become so pronounced that it falls to the ground, and, after a\r\nshort struggle, succumbs to the disease. In other cases, again, the\r\nanimal falls to the ground and appears to be suffering from acute pain,\r\nstruggles violently, sweat covers the body, and respiration is very\r\nhurried. The struggles soon exhaust the patient's strength, and for a\r\ntime it lies quiet; soon, however, the struggles commence again,\r\ncontinuing until death occurs. In some cases the appetite is voracious.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of the disease as observed in experimentally inoculated\r\nanimals are as follows: Twenty-four hours after the subcutaneous\r\ninjection of a small quantity of surra blood, in the great majority of\r\ncases, a small circumscribed and somewhat raised swelling is noticed at\r\nthe seat of the inoculation. After forty-eight hours the tumor has\r\nincreased in size and is accompanied with some edema; it presents a\r\ncertain amount of tension of the parts involved, and is generally tender\r\non manipulation. These conditions continue to increase, until by the\r\nfourth day the tumor may measure 3 or 4 inches in; one direction by 2 or\r\n3 in the other, and raised to the extent of an inch or an inch and a\r\nhalf above the surrounding tissues, or in some cases the tumor presents\r\nan almost circular form throughout. It will be also found that, if the\r\ntumor is firmly grasped, it is not fixed, but can be lifted up from the\r\nsubcutaneous tissue. According to the nature and quantity of the\r\ninoculated blood, these symptoms rapidly present themselves, and either\r\nattain a maximum or are retarded until, varying from the fourth to the\r\nthirteenth day, the tumor at the seat of inoculation will be found to\r\nhave lost a certain amount of its tension and tenderness. From this date\r\nthe swelling and edema gradually begin to grow less, until finally,\r\nafter a period of 10 to 14 days, the only sign left of the former\r\nswelling is a slight thickening of the skin over the point of the\r\ninjection; but at the moment when the tension and tenderness of the\r\nparts at the seat of inoculation become suddenly decreased a symptom of\r\nthe utmost clinical importance takes place, namely, at that moment the\r\nparasite of surra enters the blood of the general circulation.\r\n\r\nThe temperature on the day of inoculation, and, in fact, for several\r\ndays afterwards, may remain normal in character, there being only a few\r\ndegrees difference between the morning and evening observations. In\r\nother cases there may be a slight rise from the first evening, and a\r\ngradual progressive rise until the swelling at the seat of inoculation\r\nshows signs of reduction in size, when the temperature generally takes a\r\ndecided rise again, and may attain 104 deg. or 105.8 deg. F. This elevation will\r\nlast a varying period of from two to six days, and on the day following\r\nits onset the ordinary symptoms of fever will be noticed, and in\r\naddition there will be petechiae on the conjunctival membranes,\r\nlacrimation, a slight mucous discharge from the nose, and in severe\r\ncases some edema of the lower portion of the legs, and perhaps of the\r\nsheath in horses. At the termination of the period of fever the\r\ntemperature will be found to have fallen to normal or nearly so; the\r\nanimal will present a brighter aspect, and there is every appearance of\r\nits return to health; in a few days, however, the animal again appears\r\ndull and half asleep; the temperature is elevated, a relapse takes\r\nplace, and a repetition of all the symptoms in the primary paroxysm,\r\nincluding the reappearance of the parasite, is observed.\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--A diagnosis may also be established by the\r\ncomplement-fixation or agglutination tests with the sera from suspected\r\nanimals. This, however, can be carried out only in laboratories and\r\nrequires special facilities for its execution.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--No satisfactory treatment is known. Intravenous injections\r\nof Fowler's solution of arsenic give temporary relief, but relapses\r\noccur. In view of the great economic importance of this disease, it\r\nwould not be advisable to attempt to treat any sporadic cases should\r\nthey occur in this country. On the contrary, the animals should be\r\nslaughtered immediately and their carcasses promptly burned.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSTEOPOROSIS OR BIGHEAD.\r\n\r\nBy JOHN R. MOHLER, V. M. D., _Assistant Chief, Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry_.\r\n\r\nOsteoporosis is a general disease of the bones which develops slowly and\r\nprogressively and is characterized by the absorption of the calcareous\r\nor compact bony substance and the formation of enlarged, softened, and\r\nporous bone. It is particularly manifest in the bones of the head,\r\ncausing enlargement and bulging of the face and jaws, thereby giving\r\nrise to the terms \"bighead\" and \"swelled head,\" which are applied to it.\r\nThe disease affects horses, mules, and asses of all ages, classes, and\r\nbreeds, and of both sexes, and is found under all soil, dietetic, and\r\nclimatic conditions. It may occur in sporadic form, but in certain\r\nregions, such as South Africa, Australia, Madagascar, India, Hawaii, and\r\nin this country it seems to be enzootic, several cases usually appearing\r\nin the same stable or on the same farm, and numerous animals being\r\naffected in the same district. In the United States the disease has been\r\nfound in all the States bordering the Delaware River and Chesapeake Bay,\r\nin some of the New England States, and in many of the Southern States,\r\nespecially in low regions along the coast. In Europe the disease appears\r\nto be quite rare, and is usually described as a form of osteomalacia, a\r\ndisease which is not uncommon among cattle of that continent. The\r\nopinion that bighead is only a form of osteomalacia, however, can not be\r\naccepted, nor can the infrequency of the former among European horses\r\nand the frequency of the latter among other live stock be conceded on\r\nthe argument which has been presented, namely, that the better care\r\nwhich horses receive prevents them from becoming affected. In the\r\nSouthwest, where osteomalacia, or creeps, has not infrequently been\r\nobserved among range cattle by the writer, no case of osteoporosis of\r\nthe horses using the same range has been noted, although the latter\r\nanimals are given no more attention than the cattle.\r\n\r\nThe appropriate treatment of osteomalacia in cattle is so effective that\r\nif osteoporosis were a similar manifestation of disease a similar line\r\nof treatment should prove equally efficacious. However, this is not the\r\nfact. On the other hand, the occurrence of osteomalacia on old, worn-out\r\nsoil, or on land deficient in lime salts, or from eating feed lacking in\r\nthese bone-forming substances, or drinking water with a lime deficiency,\r\nis in perfect accord with our knowledge of the disease. But osteoporosis\r\nmay occur on rich, fertile soil, in the most hygienic stables, and in\r\nanimals receiving the best of care and of bone-forming feeds with a\r\nproper amount of mineral salts in the drinking water.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--The cause of this disease still remains obscure, although\r\nvarious theories have been advanced, some entirely erroneous, others\r\nmore or less plausible; but none of them has been established. Thus the\r\nidea that feeding fodder and cereals poor in mineral salts and grazing\r\nin pastures where the soil is poor in lime and phosphates will cause the\r\ndisease has been entirely disproved in many instances. Others have\r\nconsidered that the disease starts as a muscular rheumatism which is\r\nfollowed by an inflammatory condition of the bones, terminating in\r\nosteoporosis. The idea that the disease is contagious has been advanced\r\nby many writers, although no causative agent has been isolated. Numerous\r\nexperiments have been made by inoculating the blood of an affected horse\r\ninto normal horses without results. A piece of bone taken by Pearson\r\nfrom the diseased lower jaw of a colt was transplanted into a cavity\r\nmade for it in the jaw of a normal horse, but without reproducing the\r\ndisease. Petrone believes that the _Micrococcus nitrificans_ causes\r\nosteomalacia in man as a result of its producing nitrous acid, which\r\ndissolves the calcareous tissues, and when injected into dogs in pure\r\nculture a similar disease is produced. It is probable that if this work\r\nis confirmed a somewhat similar causative factor will be discovered for\r\nosteoporosis.\r\n\r\nElliott considers the latter disease to be of microbic origin, the\r\nresult of climatic conditions, and divides the island of Hawaii into two\r\ndistricts, in one of which the rainfall is 150 inches annually, where\r\nbighead is very prevalent, and the second of which is dry and rarely\r\nvisited by rain, where the disease is unknown. Removal of animals from\r\nthe wet to the dry district is followed by immediate improvement and\r\nfrequently by recovery. In the wet district horses in both good and bad\r\nstables take the disease, but in the dry districts no unfavorable or\r\nunhygienic surroundings produce the affection. As both native and\r\nimported horses are equally susceptible, there is no indication of an\r\nacquired immunity to be observed.\r\n\r\nTheiler has recently stated that his experiments in transfusing blood\r\nfrom diseased to normal horses were negative, and has suggested that the\r\ncausative agent may be transmitted by an intermediate host only, as in\r\nthe case of Texas fever. He draws attention to this method of spreading\r\nEast African coast fever, although blood inoculations, as in\r\nosteoporosis, are always without result. We know that coast fever is\r\ninfectious, and that it can not be transmitted by blood inoculations,\r\nbut is conveyed with remarkable ease by ticks from diseased cattle. That\r\nthe cause has not been observed may be accounted for by its being\r\ninvisible even to the high magnification of the microscope.\r\n\r\nOn some farms and in some stables bighead is quite prevalent, a number\r\nof cases following one after another. On one farm of Thoroughbreds in\r\nPennsylvania all the yearling colts and some of the aged horses were\r\naffected during one year, and on a similar farm in Virginia a large\r\nproportion of the horses for several years were diseased, although the\r\ncows and sheep of this farm remained unaffected.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The commencement of the disease is usually unobserved by\r\nthe owner, and these symptoms which do develop are generally not well\r\nmarked or are misleading unless other cases have been noted in the\r\nvicinity. Until the bones become enlarged the symptoms remain so vague\r\nas not to be diagnosed readily. The disease may be present itself under\r\na variety of symptoms. If the bones of the hock become affected, the\r\nanimal will first show a hock lameness. If the long bones are involved,\r\nsymptoms of rheumatism will be the first observed, while if the dorsal\r\nor lumbar vertebrae are affected indications of a strain of the lumbar\r\nregion are in evidence. Probably the first symptom to be noticed is a\r\nloss of vitality combined with an irregular appetite or other digestive\r\ndisturbance and with a tendency to stumble while in action. These\r\nearlier symptoms, however, may pass unobserved, and the appearance of an\r\nintermittent or migratory lameness without any visible cause may be the\r\nfirst sign to attract attention. This shifting and indefinite lameness,\r\ninvolving first one leg and then the other, is very suggestive, and is\r\neven more important when it is associated with a tendency to lie down\r\nfrequently in the stall and the absence of a desire to get up, or the\r\npresence of evident pain and difficulty in arising.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, or probably before, swelling of the bones of the face\r\nand jaw, which is almost constantly present in this disease, will be\r\nobserved. The bones of the lower jaw are the most frequently involved,\r\nand this condition is readily detected with the fingers by the bulging\r\nridge of the bone outside and along the lower edge of the molar teeth. A\r\nthickening of the lower jawbone may likewise be identified by feeling on\r\nboth sides of each branch at the same time and comparing it with the\r\nthinness of this bone in a normal horse. As a result mastication becomes\r\ndifficult or impossible and the teeth become loose and painful. The\r\nimperfect chewing which follows causes balls of feed to form which drop\r\nout of the mouth into the manger. Similar enlargements of the bones of\r\nthe upper jaw may be seen, causing a widening of the face and a bulging\r\nof the bones about midway between the eyes and the nostrils. In some\r\ncases the nasal bones also become swollen and deformed, which, together\r\nwith the bulging of the bones under the eyes, gives a good illustration\r\nof the reason for the application of the term bighead.\r\n\r\nOther bones of the body will undergo similar changes, but these\r\nalterations are not so readily noted except by the symptoms they\r\noccasion. The alterations of the bones of the spinal column and the\r\nlimbs, while difficult of observation, are nevertheless indicated by the\r\nreluctance of the animal to get up and the desire to remain lying for\r\nlong periods of time. The animal easily tires, moves less rapidly, and\r\nif urged to go faster may sustain a fracture or have a ligament torn\r\nfrom its bony attachments, especially in the lower bones of the leg. An\r\naffected horse weighing 1,000 pounds was seen by the writer to fracture\r\nthe large pastern bone from rearing during halter exercise.\r\n\r\nThe animal becomes poor in flesh, the coat is rough and lusterless, and\r\nthe skin tight and harsh, producing a condition termed \"hidebound,\" with\r\nconsiderable \"tucking up\" of the abdomen. The horse shows a short,\r\nstilted, choppy gait, which later becomes stiffer and more restricted,\r\nwhile on standing a position simulating that in founder is assumed, with\r\na noticeable drop to the croup. The animal at this stage usually lies\r\ndown and remains recumbent for several days at a time. Bed sores\r\nfrequently arise and fractures are not uncommon in consequence of\r\nattempts to arise, which complications, in addition to emaciation,\r\nresult in death.\r\n\r\nThe disease may exist in this manner for variable periods extending from\r\ntwo or three months to two years. The termination of the disease is\r\nuncertain at best, but is likely to be favorable if treatment and a\r\nchange of feed, water, and location is adopted in the early stages of\r\nthe malady.\r\n\r\n_Lesions._--As has been stated, the bones are the principal tissues\r\ninvolved. The nutrition of the bone is disturbed, as is indicated by the\r\ndiminished density or rarefaction of the bony substances, the increase\r\nin the size or widening of the Haversian canal and the medullary cavity,\r\nand the enlargement of the network of spaces in the spongy tissue, the\r\nabsorptive changes following the course of the Haversian system. In this\r\nprocess of absorption there are formed within the substance of the bone\r\nareas of erosion, indentations, or hollow spaces of irregular shape.\r\nThese spaces increase in size and become confluent, causing an\r\nappearance resembling some varieties of coral. The affected bone may be\r\nreadily incised with a knife, the cut surface appearing finely porous.\r\nThis porous area is soft, pliable, and yields easily to the pressure of\r\nthe finger. It has been shown by chemical analysis that the bone of an\r\nosteoporotic horse, when compared with that of a normal horse, shows a\r\nreduction in the amount of fat, phosphoric acid, lime, and soda, but a\r\nslight increase in organic matter and silicic acid. The bones lose their\r\nyellowish-white appearance, becoming gray and brittle. The affected\r\nbones may be those of any region or portion of the body. Besides the\r\nchange already noted in the bones of the face, the ends of the long\r\nbones, such as the ribs, are involved, and may be sectioned, though not\r\nso readily as the facial bones. The bones of the vertebrae are also\r\nfrequently involved, necessitating great care in casting a horse, as the\r\nwriter has seen several cases of broken backs in casting such animals\r\nfor other operations. The marrow and cancellated tissue of the long\r\nbones may contain hemorrhages and soft gelatinous material or coagulated\r\nfibrin. The internal organs are usually normal, but a catarrhal\r\ncondition of the gastrointestinal tract may be noted as the result of\r\nthe improper mastication, resulting from the enlargement of the jaws and\r\nsoreness of the teeth.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The affected animal should be immediately placed under new\r\nconditions, both as to feed and surroundings. If the horse has been\r\nstable fed, it is advisable to turn it out on grass for two or three\r\nmonths, preferably in a higher altitude. If the disease has been\r\ncontracted while running on pasture, place the animal in the stable or\r\ncorral. In the early stages of the disease beneficial results have\r\nfollowed the supplemental use of lime given in the drinking water. One\r\npeck of lime slaked in a cask of water and additional water added from\r\ntime to time is satisfactory and can be provided at slight expense. This\r\ntreatment may be supplemented by giving a tablespoonful of powdered bone\r\nmeal in each feed, with free access to a large piece of rock salt, or\r\nthe bone meal may be given with four tablespoonfuls of molasses mixed\r\nwith the feed. Feeds containing mineral salts, such as beans, cowpeas,\r\noats, and cottonseed meal, may prove beneficial in replenishing the bony\r\nsubstance that is being absorbed. Cottonseed meal is one of the best\r\nfeeds for this purpose, but it should be fed carefully. The animal\r\nshould not be allowed to work at all during the active stage of the\r\ndisease, nor should it be used for breeding purposes.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] This summary of symptoms is based upon work by Lingard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHORSESHOEING.\r\n\r\nBy JOHN W. ADAMS, A. B., V. M.,\r\n\r\n_Professor of Surgery and Lecturer on Shoeing, Veterinary Department,\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania._\r\n\r\n\r\nBad and indifferent shoeing so frequently leads to diseases of the feet\r\nand in irregularities of gait, which may render a horse unserviceable,\r\nthat it has been thought appropriate to conclude this book with a brief\r\nchapter on the principles involved in shoeing healthy hoofs.\r\n\r\nIn unfolding this subject in the limited space at my disposal, I can\r\nonly hope to give the intelligent horse owner a sufficient number of\r\nfacts, based on experience and upon the anatomy and physiology of the\r\nfoot and leg, to enable him to avoid the more serious consequences of\r\nimproper shoeing.\r\n\r\nLet us first examine this vital mechanism, the foot, and learn something\r\nof its structure and of the natural movements of its component parts,\r\nthat we may be prepared to recognize deviations from the normal and to\r\napply the proper corrective.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROSS ANATOMY OF THE FOOT.\r\n\r\n(Pls. XXXII-XXXIV.)\r\n\r\nThe bones of the foot are four in number, three of which--the long\r\npastern, short pastern, and coffin bone, placed end to end--form a\r\ncontinuous straight column passing downward and forward from the fetlock\r\njoint to the ground. A small accessory bone, the navicular, or\r\n\"shuttle,\" bone, lies crosswise in the foot between the wings of the\r\ncoffin bone and forms a part of the joint surface of the latter. The\r\nshort pastern projects about 1-/2 inches above the hoof and extends\r\nabout an equal distance to it. (See also page 395.)\r\n\r\nThe pastern and the coffin bone are held together by strong fibrous\r\ncords passing between each two bones and placed at the sides so as not\r\nto interfere with the forward and backward movement of the bones. The\r\njoints are therefore hinge joints, though imperfect, because, while the\r\nchief movements are those of extension and flexion in a single plane,\r\nsome slight rotation and lateral movements are possible.\r\n\r\nThe bones are still further bound together and supported by three long\r\nfibrous cords, or tendons. One, the extensor tendon of the toe, passes\r\ndown the front of the pasterns and attaches to the coffin bone just\r\nbelow the edge of the hair; when pulled upon by its muscle this tendon\r\ndraws the toe forward and enables the horse to place the hoof flat upon\r\nthe ground. The other two tendons are placed behind the pasterns and are\r\ncalled flexors, because they flex, or bend, the pasterns and coffin bone\r\nbackward. One of the tendons is attached to the upper end of the short\r\npastern, while the other passes down between the heels, glides over the\r\nunder surface of the navicular bone, and attaches itself to the under\r\nsurface of the coffin bone. These two tendons not only flex, or fold up,\r\nthe foot as the latter leaves the ground during motion, but at rest\r\nassist the suspensory ligament in supporting the fetlock joint.\r\n\r\nThe foot-axis is an imaginary line passing from the fetlock joint\r\nthrough the long axes of the two pasterns and coffin bone. This\r\nimaginary line, which shows the direction of the pasterns and coffin\r\nbone, should always be straight--that is, never broken, either forward\r\nor backward when viewed from the side, or inward or outward when\r\nobserved from in front. Viewed from one side, the long axis of the long\r\npastern, when prolonged to the ground, should be parallel to the line of\r\nthe toe. Viewed from in front, the long axis of the long pastern, when\r\nprolonged to the ground, should cut the hoof exactly at the middle of\r\nthe toe.\r\n\r\nRaising the heel or shortening the toe not only tilts the coffin bone\r\nforward and makes the hoof stand steeper at the toe, but slackens the\r\ntendon that attaches to the under surface of the coffin bone (perforans\r\ntendon), and therefore allows the fetlock joint to sink downward and\r\nbackward and the long pastern to assume a more nearly horizontal\r\nposition. The foot-axis, viewed from one side, is now broken forward;\r\nthat is, the long pastern is less steep than the toe, and the heels are\r\neither too long or the toe is too short. On the other hand, raising the\r\ntoe or lowering the heels of a foot with a straight foot-axis not only\r\ntilts the coffin bone backward and renders the toe more nearly\r\nhorizontal, but tenses the perforans tendon, which then forces the\r\nfetlock joint forward, causing the long pastern to stand steeper. The\r\nfoot-axis, seen from one side, is now broken backward--an indication\r\nthat the toe is relatively too long or that the heels are relatively too\r\nlow.\r\n\r\nThe elastic tissues of the foot are preeminently the lateral cartilages\r\nand the plantar cushion. The lateral cartilages are two irregularly\r\nfour-sided plates of gristle, one on either side of the foot, extending\r\nfrom the wings of the coffin bone backward to the heels and upward to a\r\ndistance of an inch or more above the edge of the hair, where they may\r\nbe felt by the fingers. When sound, these plates are elastic and yield\r\nreadily to moderate finger pressure, but from various causes may undergo\r\nossification, in which condition they are hard and unyielding. The\r\nplantar cushion is a wedge-shaped mass of tough, elastic, fibro-fatty\r\ntissue filling all the space between the lateral cartilages, forming the\r\nfleshy heels and the fleshy frog, and serving as a buffer to disperse\r\nshock when the foot is set to the ground. It extends forward underneath\r\nthe navicular bone and perforans tendon, and protects these structures\r\nfrom injurious pressure from below. Instantaneous photographs show that\r\nat speed the horse sets the heels to the ground before other parts of\r\nthe foot--conclusive proof that the function of this tough, elastic\r\nstructure is to dissipate and render harmless violent impact of the foot\r\nwith the ground.\r\n\r\nThe horn-producing membrane, or \"quick,\" as it is commonly termed, is\r\nmerely a downward prolongation of the \"derm,\" or true skin, and may be\r\nconveniently called the pododerm (foot skin). The pododerm closely\r\ninvests the coffin bone, lateral cartilages, and plantar cushion, much\r\nas a sock covers the human foot, and is itself covered by the horny\r\ncapsule, or hoof. It differs from the external skin, or hair skin, in\r\nhaving no sweat or oil glands, but, like it, is richly supplied with\r\nblood vessels and sensitive nerves. And, just as the derm of the hair\r\nskin produces upon its outer surface layer upon layer of horny cells\r\n(epiderm), which protect the sensitive and vascular derm, so, likewise,\r\nin the foot the pododerm produces over its entire surface soft cells,\r\nwhich, pushed away by more recent cells forming beneath, lose moisture\r\nby evaporation and are rapidly transformed into the corneous material\r\nwhich we call the hoof. It is proper to regard the hoof as a greatly\r\nthickened epiderm having many of the qualities possessed by such\r\nepidermal structures as hair, feathers, nails, claws, etc.\r\n\r\nThe functions of the pododerm are to produce the hoof and to unite it\r\nfirmly to the foot.\r\n\r\nThere are five parts of the pododerm, easily distinguishable when the\r\nhoof has been removed, namely: (1) The perioplic band, a narrow ridge\r\nfrom one-sixteenth to one-eighth of an inch wide, running along the edge\r\nof the hair from one heel around the toe to the other. This band\r\nproduces the perioplic horn, the thin varnishlike layer of glistening\r\nhorn, which forms the surface of the wall or \"crust,\" and whose purpose\r\nseems to be to retard evaporation of moisture from the wall. (2) The\r\ncoronary band, a prominent fleshy cornice encircling the foot just below\r\nand parallel to the perioplic band. At the heels it is reflected forward\r\nalong the sides of the fleshy frog, to become lost near the apex of this\r\nlatter structure. The coronet produces the middle layer of the wall, and\r\nthe reflexed portions produce the \"bars,\" which are, therefore, to be\r\nregarded merely as a turning forward of the wall. (3) The fleshy leaves,\r\n500 to 600 in number, parallel to one another, running downward and\r\nforward from the lower edge of the coronary band to the margin of the\r\nfleshy sole. They produce the soft, light-colored horny leaves which\r\nform the deepest layer of the wall, and serve as a strong bond of union\r\nbetween the middle layer of the wall and the fleshy leaves with which\r\nthey dovetail. (4) The fleshy sole, which covers the entire under\r\nsurface of the foot, excepting the fleshy frog and bars. The horny sole\r\nis produced by the fleshy sole. (5) The fleshy frog, which covers the\r\nunder surface of the plantar cushion and produces the horny frog.\r\n\r\nThe horny box or hoof consists of wall and bars, sole and frog. The wall\r\nis all that part of the hoof which is visible when the foot is on the\r\nground (see fig. 8). As already stated, it consists of three layers--the\r\nperiople, the middle layer, and the leafy layer.\r\n\r\nThe bars (see fig. 1c) are forward prolongations of the wall, and are\r\ngradually lost near the point of the frog. The angle between the wall\r\nand a bar is called the \"buttress.\" Each bar lies against the horny frog\r\non one side and incloses a wing of the sole on the other, so that the\r\nleast expansion or contraction of the horny frog separates or\r\napproximates the bars, and through them the lateral cartilages and the\r\nwalls of the quarters. The lower border of the wall is called the\r\n\"bearing edge,\" and is the surface against which the shoe bears. By\r\ndividing the entire lower circumference of the wall into five equal\r\nparts, a toe, two side walls, and two quarters will be exhibited. The\r\n\"heels,\" strictly speaking, are the two rounded soft prominences of the\r\nplantar cushion, lying one above each quarter. The outer wall is usually\r\nmore slanting than the inner, and _the more slanting half of a hoof is\r\nalways the thicker_. In front hoofs the wall is thickest at the toe and\r\ngradually thins out toward the quarters, where in some horses it may not\r\nexceed one-fourth of an inch. In hind hoofs there is much less\r\ndifference in thickness between the toe, side walls, and quarters. The\r\nhorny sole, from which the flakes of old horn have been removed, is\r\nconcave and about as thick as the wall at the toe. It is rough, uneven\r\nand often covered by flakes of dead horn in process of being loosened\r\nand cast off. Behind the sole presents an opening into which are\r\nreceived the bars and horny frog. This opening divides the sole into a\r\nbody and two wings.\r\n\r\nThe periphery of the sole unites with the lower border of the wall and\r\nbars through the medium of the white line, which is the cross section of\r\nthe leafy horn layer of the wall and of short plugs of horn which grow\r\ndown from the lower ends of the fleshy leaves. This white line is of\r\nmuch importance to the shoer, since its distance from the outer border\r\nof the hoof is the thickness of the wall, and in the white line all\r\nnails should be driven.\r\n\r\nThe frog, secreted by the pododerm covering the plantar cushion or fatty\r\nfrog, and presenting almost the same form as the latter, lies as a soft\r\nand very elastic wedge between the bars and between the edges of the\r\nsole just in front of the bars. A broad and shallow depression in its\r\ncenter divides it into two branches, which diverge as they pass backward\r\ninto the horny bulbs of the heel. In front of the middle cleft the two\r\nbranches unite to form the body of the frog, which ends in the point of\r\nthe frog. The bar of a bar shoe should rest on the branches of the frog.\r\nIn unshod hoofs the bearing edge of the wall, the sole, frog, and bars\r\nare all on a level; that is, the under surface of the hoof is perfectly\r\nflat, and each of these structures assists in bearing the body weight.\r\n\r\nWith respect to solidity, the different parts of the hoof vary widely.\r\nThe middle layer of the wall is harder and more tenacious than the sole,\r\nfor the latter crumbles away or passes off in larger or smaller flakes\r\non its under surface, while no such spontaneous shortening of the wall\r\noccurs. The white line and the frog are soft-horn structures, and differ\r\nfrom hard horn in that their horn cells do not under natural conditions\r\nbecome hard and hornlike. They are very elastic, absorb moisture\r\nrapidly, and as readily dry out and become hard, brittle, and easily\r\nfissured. Horn of good quality is fine grained and tough, while bad horn\r\nis coarse grained and either mellow and friable or hard and brittle. All\r\nhorn is a poor conductor of heat, and the harder (drier) the horn the\r\nmore slowly does it transmit extremes of temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHYSIOLOGICAL MOVEMENTS OF THE HOOF.\r\n\r\nA hoof while supporting the body weight has a different form, and the\r\nstructures inclosed within the hoof have a different position than when\r\nnot bearing weight. Since the amount of weight borne by a foot is\r\ncontinually changing, and the relations of internal pressure are\r\ncontinuously varying, a foot is, from a physiological viewpoint, never\r\nat rest. The most marked changes of form of the hoof occur when the foot\r\nbears the greatest weight, namely, at the time of the greatest descent\r\nof the fetlock. Briefly, these changes of form are: (1) An expansion or\r\nwidening of the whole back half of the foot from the coronet to the\r\nlower edge of the quarters. This expansion varies between one-fiftieth\r\nand one-twelfth of an inch. (2) A narrowing of the front half of the\r\nfoot, measured at the coronet. (3) A sinking of the heels and a\r\nflattening of the wings of the sole. These changes are more marked in\r\nthe half of the foot that bears the greater weight.\r\n\r\nThe changes of form occur in the following order. When the foot is set\r\nto the ground the body weight is transmitted through the bones and\r\nsensitive and horny leaves to the wall. The coffin bone and navicular\r\nbone sink a little and rotate backward. At the same time the short\r\npastern sinks backward and downward between the lateral cartilages and\r\npresses the perforans tendon upon the plantar cushion. This cushion\r\nbeing compressed from above and being unable to expand downward by\r\nreason of the resistance of the ground acting against the horny frog,\r\nacts like any other elastic mass and expands toward the sides, pushing\r\nbefore it the yielding lateral cartilages and the wall of the quarters.\r\nThis expansion of the heels is assisted and increased by the\r\nsimultaneous flattening and lateral expansion of the resilient horny\r\nfrog, which crowds the bars apart. Of course, when the lateral\r\ncartilages are ossified, not only is no expansion of the quarters\r\npossible, but frog pressure often leads to painful compression of the\r\nplantar cushion and to increase of lameness. Frog pressure is therefore\r\ncontraindicated in lameness due to sidebones (ossified cartilages).\r\nUnder the descent of the coffin bone the horny sole sinks a little; that\r\nis, the arch of the sole around the point of the frog and the wings of\r\nthe sole become somewhat flattened. All these changes of form are most\r\nmarked in sound unshod hoofs, because in them ground pressure on the\r\nfrog and sole is pronounced; they are more marked in fore hoofs than in\r\nhind hoofs.\r\n\r\nThe movement of the different structures within the foot and the changes\r\nof form that occur at every step are indispensable to the health of the\r\nhoof, so that these elastic tissues must be kept active by regular\r\nexercise, with protection against drying out of the hoof. Long-continued\r\nrest in the stable, drying out of the hoof, and shoeing decrease or\r\nalter the physiological movements of the hoof and sometimes lead to foot\r\ndiseases. Since these movements are complete and spontaneous only in\r\nunshod feet, shoeing must be regarded as an evil, albeit a necessary\r\none, and indispensable if we wish to keep horses continuously\r\nserviceable on hard, artificial roads. However, if in shoeing we bear in\r\nmind the structure and functions of the hoof and apply a shoe whose\r\nbranches have a wide and level bearing surface, so as to interfere as\r\nlittle as may be with the expansion and contraction of the quarters, in\r\nso far as this is not hindered by the nails, we need not be apprehensive\r\nof trouble, provided the horse has reasonable work and his hoofs proper\r\ncare.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROWTH OF THE HOOF.\r\n\r\nAll parts of the hoof grow downward and forward with equal rapidity, the\r\nrate of growth being largely dependent upon the amount of blood supplied\r\nto the pododerm, or \"quick.\" Abundant and regular exercise, good\r\ngrooming, moistness and suppleness of the hoof, going barefoot, plenty\r\nof good feed, and at proper intervals removing the overgrowth of hoof\r\nand regulating the bearing surface, by increasing the volume and\r\nimproving the quality of the blood flowing into the pododerm, favor the\r\nrapid growth of horn of good quality; while lack of exercise, dryness of\r\nthe horn, and excessive length of the hoof hinder growth.\r\n\r\nThe average rate of growth is about one-third of an inch a month. Hind\r\nhoofs grow faster than fore hoofs and unshod ones faster than shod ones.\r\nThe time required for the horn to grow from the coronet to the ground,\r\nthough influenced to a slight degree by the precited conditions, varies\r\nin proportion to the distance of the coronet from the ground. At the\r\ntoe, depending on its height, the horn grows down in 11 to 13 months, at\r\nthe side wall in 6 to 8 months, and at the heels in 3 to 5 months. We\r\ncan thus estimate with tolerable accuracy the time required for the\r\ndisappearance of such defects in the hoof as cracks, clefts, etc.\r\n\r\nIrregular growth is not infrequent. The almost invariable cause of this\r\nis an improper distribution of the body weight over the hoof--that is,\r\nan unbalanced foot. Colts running in soft pasture or confined for long\r\nperiods in the stable are frequently allowed to grow hoofs of excessive\r\nlength. The long toe becomes \"dished\"--that is, concave from the coronet\r\nto the ground--the long quarters curl forward and inward and often\r\ncompletely cover the frog and lead to contraction of the heels, or the\r\nwhole hoof bends outward or inward, and a crooked foot, or, even worse,\r\na crooked leg, is the result if the long hoof be allowed to exert its\r\npowerful and abnormally directed leverage for but a few months upon\r\nyoung plastic bones and tender and lax articular ligaments. All colts\r\nare not foaled with straight legs, but failure to regulate the length\r\nand bearing of the hoof may make a straight leg crooked and a crooked\r\nleg worse, just as intelligent care during the growing period can\r\ngreatly improve a congenitally crooked limb. If breeders were more\r\ngenerally cognizant of the power of overgrown and unbalanced hoofs to\r\ndivert the lower bones of young legs from their proper direction, and,\r\ntherefore, to cause them to be moved improperly, with loss of speed and\r\noften with injury to the limbs, we might hope to see fewer knock-kneed,\r\nbow-legged, \"splay-footed,\" \"pigeon-toed,\" cow-hocked, interfering, and\r\npaddling horses.\r\n\r\nIf in shortening the hoof one side wall is, from ignorance, left too\r\nlong or cut down too low with relation to the other, the foot will be\r\nunbalanced, and in traveling the long section will touch the ground\r\nfirst and will continue to do so till it has been reduced to its proper\r\nlevel (length) by the increased wear which will take place at this\r\npoint. While this occurs rapidly in unshod hoofs, the shoe prevents wear\r\nof the hoof, though it is itself more rapidly worn away beneath the high\r\n(long) side than elsewhere, so that by the time the shoe is worn out the\r\ntread of the shoe may be flat. If this mistake be repeated from month to\r\nmonth, the part of the wall left too high will grow more rapidly than\r\nthe low side whose pododerm is relatively anemic as a result of the\r\ngreater weight falling into this half of the hoof, and the ultimate\r\nresult will be a \"wry,\" or crooked foot.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CARE OF UNSHOD HOOFS.\r\n\r\nThe colt should have abundant exercise on dry ground. The hoofs will\r\nthen wear gradually, and it will only be necessary from time to time to\r\nregulate any uneven wear with the rasp and to round off the sharp edge\r\nabout the toe in order to prevent breaking away of the wall.\r\n\r\nColts in the stable can not wear down their hoofs, so that every four to\r\nsix weeks they should be rasped down and the lower edge of the wall well\r\nrounded to prevent chipping. The soles and clefts of the frog should be\r\npicked out every few days and the entire hoof washed clean. Plenty of\r\nclean straw litter should be provided. Hoofs that are becoming \"awry\"\r\nshould have the wall shortened in such a manner as to straighten the\r\nfoot-axis. This will ultimately produce a good hoof and will improve the\r\nposition of the limb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Ground surface of a right fore hoof of the\r\nregular form: a, a, wall; a-a, the toe; a-b, the side walls;\r\nb-d, the quarters; c, c, the bars; d, d, the buttress; e,\r\nlateral cleft of the frog; f, body of the sole; g, g', g\", leafy\r\nlayer (white line) of the toe and bars; h, body of the frog; i, i,\r\nbranches of the frog; k, k, horny bulbs of the heels; l, middle\r\ncleft of the frog.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF A HEALTHY HOOF.\r\n\r\nA healthy hoof (figs. 1 and 8) is equally warm at all parts, and is not\r\ntender under pressure with the hands or moderate compression with\r\npincers. The coronet is soft and elastic at all points and does not\r\nproject beyond the surface of the wall. The wall (fig. 8) is straight\r\nfrom coronet to ground, so that a straightedge laid against the wall\r\nfrom coronet to ground parallel to the direction of the horn tubes will\r\ntouch at every point. The wall should be covered with the outer\r\nvarnishlike layer (periople) and should show no cracks or clefts. Every\r\nhoof shows \"ring formation,\" but the rings should not be strongly marked\r\nand should always run parallel to the coronary band. Strongly marked\r\nring-formation over the entire wall is an evidence of a weak hoof, but\r\nwhen limited to a part of the wall is evidence of previous local\r\ninflammation. The bulbs of the heels should be full, rounded, and of\r\nequal height. The sole (fig. 1) should be well hollowed out, the white\r\nline solid, the frog well developed, the middle cleft of the frog broad\r\nand shallow, the spaces between the bars and the frog wide and shallow,\r\nthe bars straight from the buttress toward the point of the frog, and\r\nthe buttresses themselves so far apart as not to press against the\r\nbranches of the frog. A hoof can not be considered healthy if it\r\npresents reddish discolored horn, cracks in the wall, white line, bars,\r\nor frog, thrush of the frog, contraction or displacement of the heels.\r\nThe lateral cartilages should yield readily to finger pressure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Pair of fore feet of regular form in regular\r\nstanding position.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIOUS FORMS OF HOOFS.\r\n\r\nAs among a thousand human faces no two are alike, so among an equal\r\nnumber of horses no two have hoofs exactly alike. A little study of\r\ndifferent forms soon shows us, however, that the form of every hoof is\r\ndependent in great measure on the direction of the two pastern bones as\r\nviewed from in front or behind, or from one side; and that all hoofs\r\nfall into three classes when we view them from in front and three\r\nclasses when we observe them in profile. Inasmuch as the form of every\r\nfoot determines the peculiarities of the shoe that is best adapted to\r\nit, no one who is ignorant of, or who disregards the natural form of, a\r\nhoof can hope to understand physiological shoeing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Pair of fore feet of base-wide form in toe-wide\r\nstanding position.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMS OF FEET VIEWED FROM IN FRONT AND IN PROFILE.\r\n\r\nWhether a horse's feet be observed from in front or from behind, their\r\nform corresponds to, or at least resembles, either that of the regular\r\nposition (fig. 2), the base-wide or too-wide position (fig. 3), or the\r\nbase-narrow position (fig. 4).\r\n\r\nBy the direction of the imaginary line passing through the long axes of\r\nthe two pasterns (figs. 2, 4, 5) we determine whether or not the hoof\r\nand pasterns stand in proper mutual relation.\r\n\r\nIn the regular standing position (fig. 2) the foot-axis runs straight\r\ndownward and forward; in the base-wide position (fig. 3) it runs\r\nobliquely downward and outward, and in the base-narrow position (fig. 4)\r\nit runs obliquely downward and inward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Pair of fore feet of base-narrow form in\r\ntoe-narrow standing position.]\r\n\r\nViewing the foot in profile, we distinguish the regular position (fig.\r\n5b) and designate all forward deviations as acute-angled (long toe and\r\nlow heel, fig. 5a), and all deviations backward from the regular\r\n(steep toe and high heel, fig. 5c) as steep-toed, or stumpy. When the\r\nbody weight is evenly distributed over all four limbs, the foot-axis\r\nshould be straight; the long pastern, short pastern, and wall at the toe\r\nshould have the same slant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--a, Side view of an acute-angled fore foot\r\n(shod); b, side view of a regular fore foot, showing the most\r\ndesirable degree of obliquity (34 deg.); c, side view of a stumpy, or\r\n\"upright,\" fore foot; obliquity above 50 deg.. In a, b, c, note\r\nparticularly the relation between the length of the slope and the\r\noverhanging of the heels. Note also the toe roll of the shoes.]\r\n\r\n_A front hoof of the regular standing position._--The outer wall is a\r\nlittle more slanting and somewhat thicker than the inner. The lower\r\nborder of the outer quarter describes the arc of a smaller circle--that\r\nis, is more sharply bent than the inner quarter. The weight falls near\r\nthe center of the foot and is evenly distributed over the whole bottom\r\nof the hoof. The toe forms an angle with the ground of 45 deg. to 50 deg. and is\r\nparallel to the direction of the long pastern. The toe points straight\r\nahead, and when the horse is moving forward in a straight line the hoofs\r\nare picked up and carried forward in a line parallel to the middle line\r\nof the body, and are set down flat. Coming straight toward the observer\r\nthe hoofs seem to rise and fall perpendicularly.\r\n\r\n_A hoof of the base-wide position_ is always awry. The outer wall is\r\nmore slanting, longer, and thicker than the inner, the outer quarter\r\nmore curved than the inner, and the outer half of the sole wider than\r\nthe inner. The weight falls largely into the inner half of the hoof. In\r\nmotion the hoof is moved in a circle. From its position on the ground it\r\nbreaks over the inner toe, is carried forward and inward close to the\r\nsupporting leg, thence forward and outward to the ground, which the hoof\r\nmeets first with the outer toe. Horses that are toe-wide\r\n(\"splay-footed\"--toes turned outward) show all these peculiarities of\r\nhoof-form and hoof-flight to a still more marked degree and are\r\ntherefore more prone to \"interfere\" when in motion.\r\n\r\n_A hoof of the base-narrow position_ is awry, but not to so marked a\r\ndegree as the base-wide hoof. The inner wall is usually a little more\r\nslanting than the outer, the inner half of the sole wider than the\r\nouter, and the inner quarter more curved than the outer. The outer\r\nquarter is often flattened and drawn in at the bottom. The weight falls\r\nlargely into the outer half of the hoof. In motion the hoof breaks over\r\nthe outer toe, is carried forward and outward at some distance from the\r\nsupporting leg, thence forward and inward to the ground, which it\r\ngenerally meets with the outer toe. The foot thus moves in a circle,\r\nwhose convexity is outward, a manner of flight called \"paddling.\" A\r\nbase-narrow horse, whose toes point straight ahead, frequently\r\n\"interferes,\" while a toe-narrow (pigeon-toed) animal seldom does.\r\n\r\n_A regular hoof_ (fig. 5b), viewed from one side, has a straight\r\nfoot-axis inclined to the horizon at an angle of 45 deg. to 50 deg.. The weight\r\nfalls near the center of the foot and there is moderate expansion of the\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\n_An acute-angled hoof_ (fig. 5a) has a straight foot-axis inclined at\r\nan angle less than 45 deg. to the horizon. The weight falls more largely in\r\nthe back half of the hoof and there is greater length of hoof in contact\r\nwith the ground and greater expansion of the heels than in the regular\r\nhoof.\r\n\r\n_Upright or stumpy hoof._--In the upright or stumpy hoof (fig. 5c) the\r\nfoot-axis is straight and more than 55 deg. steep. The hoof is relatively\r\nshort from toe to heel, the weight falls farther forward, and there is\r\nless expansion of the heels than in the regular hoof.\r\n\r\n_Wide and narrow hoofs._--Finally, there are wide hoofs and narrow\r\nhoofs, dependent solely upon race and breeding. The wide hoof is almost\r\ncircular on the ground surface, the sole but little concave, the frog\r\nlarge, and the quality of the horn coarse. The narrow hoof has a\r\nstrongly \"cupped\" sole, a small frog, nearly perpendicular side walls,\r\nand fine-grained, tough horn.\r\n\r\n_Hind hoofs_ are influenced in shape by different directions of their\r\npasterns much as front feet are. A hind hoof is not round at the toe as\r\na front hoof is, but is more pointed. Its greatest width is two-thirds\r\nof the way back from toe to heel, the sole is more concave, the heels\r\nrelatively wider, and the toe about 10 deg. steeper than in front hoofs.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION PRELIMINARY TO SHOEING.\r\n\r\nThe object of the examination is to ascertain the direction and position\r\nof the limbs, the shape, character, and quality of the hoofs, the form,\r\nlength, position, and wear of the shoe, the number, distribution, and\r\ndirection of the nails, the manner in which the hoof leaves the ground,\r\nits line of flight, the manner in which it is set to the ground, and all\r\nother peculiarities, that at the next and subsequent shoeings proper\r\nallowances may be made and observed faults corrected. The animal must,\r\ntherefore, be observed both at rest and in motion.\r\n\r\nAt rest, the observer should stand in front and note the slant of the\r\nlong pasterns. Do they drop perpendicularly, or slant downward and\r\noutward (base-wide foot), or downward and inward (base-narrow foot)?\r\nWhatever be the direction to the long pastern, an imaginary line passing\r\nthrough its long axis, when prolonged to the ground, should apparently\r\npass through the middle of the toe. But if such line cuts through the\r\ninner toe the foot-axis is not straight, as it should be, but is broken\r\ninward at the coronet, an indication that either the outer wall of the\r\nhoof is too long (high) or that the inner wall is too short (low). On\r\nthe contrary, if the center line of the long pastern falls through the\r\nouter toe the foot-axis is broken outward at the coronet, an indication\r\nthat either the inner wall is too long or the outer wall too short.\r\n\r\nThe observer should now place himself at one side, two or three paces\r\ndistant, in order to view the limb and hoof in profile. Note the size of\r\nthe hoof in relation to the height and weight of the animal, and the\r\nobliquity of the hoof. Is the foot-axis straight--that is, does the long\r\npastern have the same slant as the toe, or does the toe of the hoof\r\nstand steeper than the long pastern (fig. 6c)? In which case the\r\nfoot-axis is broken forward at the coronet, an indication, usually, that\r\nthe quarters are either too high or that the toe is too short.\r\n\r\nIf the long pastern stands steeper than the toe (fig. 6a) the\r\nfoot-axis is broken backward, in which case the toe is too long or the\r\nquarters are too low (short). In figures 6a and 6c the dotted lines\r\npassing from toe to quarters indicate the amount of horn which must be\r\nremoved in order to straighten the foot-axis, as shown in figure 6b.\r\nNote also the length of the shoe.\r\n\r\nNext, the feet should be raised and the examiner should note the outline\r\nof the foot, the conformation of the sole, form and quality of the\r\nfrog, form of the shoe, wear of the shoe, and the number and\r\ndistribution of the nails. Does the shoe fully cover the entire lower\r\nborder of the wall? or is it too narrow, or fitted so full on the inside\r\nthat it has given rise to interfering? or has the shoe been nailed on\r\ncrooked? or has it become loose and shifted? is it too short, or so wide\r\nat the ends of the branches as not to support the buttresses of the\r\nhoof? Does the shoe correspond with the form of the hoof? Are the nails\r\ndistributed so as to interfere as little as possible with the expansion\r\nof the quarters? are there too many? are they too large? driven too\r\n\"fine\" or too high? These are questions which the observer should put to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--a, Side view of foot with the foot-axis broken\r\nbackward as a result of too long a toe. The amount of horn to be removed\r\nfrom the toe in order to straighten the foot-axis is denoted by a dotted\r\nline; b, side view of a properly balanced foot, with a straight\r\nfoot-axis of desirable slant; c, side view of stumpy foot with\r\nfoot-axis broken forward, as a result of overgrowth of the quarters. The\r\namount of horn to be removed in order to straighten the foot-axis is\r\nshown by a dotted line.]\r\n\r\nNote carefully the wear of the old shoe. It is the unimpeachable\r\nevidence of the manner in which the hoof has been set to the ground\r\nsince the shoe was nailed to it, and gives valuable \"pointers\" in\r\nleveling the hoof. Wear is the effect of friction between the shoe and\r\nthe ground at the moment of contact. Since the properly leveled hoof is\r\nset flat to the ground, the \"grounding wear\" of a shoe should be uniform\r\nat every point, though the toe will always show wear due to scouring at\r\nthe moment of \"breaking over.\" Everything which tends to lengthen the\r\nstride tends also to make the \"grounding wear\" more pronounced in the\r\nheels of the shoe, while all causes which shorten the stride--as\r\nstiffening of the limbs through age, overwork, or disease--bring the\r\ngrounding wear nearer the toe.\r\n\r\nAn exception should be noted, however, in founder, in which the\r\ngrounding wear is most pronounced at the heels.\r\n\r\nIf one branch of the shoe is found to be worn much thinner than the\r\nother, the thinner branch has either been set too near the middle line\r\nof the foot (fitted too close), where it has been bearing greater weight\r\nwhile rubbing against the ground, or, what is much more often the case,\r\nthe section of wall above the thinner branch has been too long (too\r\nhigh), or the opposite section of wall has been too short (too low).\r\n\"One-sided wear, uneven setting down of the feet, and an unnatural\r\ncourse of the wall are often found together.\" How much an old shoe can\r\ntell us, if we take time and pains to decipher its scars!\r\n\r\nThe horse should next be observed at a walk and at a trot or pace, from\r\nin front, from behind, and from the side, and the \"breaking over,\" the\r\ncarriage of the feet, and the manner of setting them to the ground\r\ncarefully noted and remembered. A horse does not always move just as his\r\nstanding position would seem to imply. Often there is so great a\r\ndifference in the form and slant of two fore hoofs or two hind hoofs\r\nthat we are in doubt as to their normal shape, when a few steps at a\r\ntrot will usually solve the problem instantly by showing us the line of\r\nflight of the hoofs and referring them to the regular, base-wide, or\r\nbase-narrow form.\r\n\r\nNo man is competent either to shoe a horse or to direct the work till he\r\nhas made the precited observations.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF THE HOOF FOR THE SHOE.\r\n\r\nAfter raising the clinches of the nails with a rather dull clinch cutter\r\n(\"buffer\") and drawing the nails one at a time, the old shoe is\r\ncritically examined and laid aside. Remaining stubs of nails are then\r\ndrawn or punched out and the hoof freed of dirt and partially detached\r\nhorn. The farrier has now to \"dress\" the overgrown hoof to receive the\r\nnew shoe; in other words, he has to form a base of support so inclined\r\nto the direction of the pasterns that in motion this surface shall be\r\nset flat upon the ground. He must not rob the hoof nor leave too much\r\nhorn; either mistake may lead to injury. If he has made a careful\r\npreliminary examination he knows what part of the wall requires removal\r\nand what part must be left, for he already knows the direction of the\r\nfoot axis and the wear of the old shoe and has made up his mind just\r\nwhere and how much horn must be removed to leave the hoof of proper\r\nlength and the foot axis straight.\r\n\r\nA greatly overgrown hoof may be quickly shortened with sharp nippers and\r\nthe sole freed of semidetached flakes of horn. The concave sole of a\r\nthick-walled, strong hoof may be pared out around the point of the frog,\r\nbut not so much as to remove all evidences of exfoliation. The wall\r\nshould be leveled with the rasp till its full thickness, the white line,\r\nand an eighth of an inch of the margin of the sole are in one horizontal\r\nplane, called the \"bearing surface of the hoof.\" The bars, if long, may\r\nbe shortened, but _never pared on the side_. The branches of the sole in\r\nthe angle between the bars and the wall of the quarters should be left a\r\nlittle lower than the wall, so as not to be pressed upon by the inner\r\nweb of the shoe. \"Corns,\" or bruises of the pododerm, are usually a\r\nresult of leaving a thick mass of dry, unyielding horn at this point.\r\nThe frog should not be touched further than to remove tags or layers\r\nthat are so loose as to form no protection. A soft frog will shorten\r\nitself spontaneously by the exfoliation of superficial layers of horn,\r\nwhile if the frog is dry, hard, and too prominent it is better to soften\r\nit by applying moisture in some form, and to allow it to wear away\r\nnaturally than to pare it down. It is of advantage to have the frog\r\nproject below the level of the wall an amount equal to the thickness of\r\na plain shoe, though we rarely see frogs of such size except in draft\r\nhorses. The sharp lower border of the wall should be rounded with the\r\nrasp to prevent its being bent outward and broken away. Finally, the\r\nfoot is set to the ground and again observed from all sides to make\r\nsure, that the lines bounding the hoof correspond with the direction of\r\nthe long pastern.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHOE.\r\n\r\nThe shoe is an artificial base of support, by no means ideal, because it\r\ninterferes to a greater or less degree with the physiology of the foot,\r\nbut indispensable except for horses at slow work on soft ground. Since a\r\nproper surface of support is of the greatest importance in preserving\r\nthe health of the feet and legs, it is necessary to consider the various\r\nforms of shoes best adapted to the different forms of hoofs. Certain\r\nproperties are common to all shoes and may be considered first. They are\r\nform, width, thickness, length, surfaces, borders, \"fullering,\" nail\r\nholes, and clips.\r\n\r\n_Form._--Every shoe should have the form of the hoof for which it is\r\nintended, provided the hoof retains its proper shape; but for every hoof\r\nthat has undergone change of form we must endeavor to give the shoe that\r\nform which the hoof originally possessed. Front shoes and hind shoes,\r\nrights and lefts, should be distinctly different and easily\r\ndistinguishable.\r\n\r\n_Width._--All shoes should be wider at the toe than at the ends of the\r\nbranches. The average width should be about double the thickness of the\r\nwall at the toe.\r\n\r\n_Thickness._--The thickness should be sufficient to make the shoe last\r\nabout four weeks and should be uniform except in special cases.\r\n\r\n_Length._--This will depend upon the obliquity of the hoof viewed in\r\nprofile. The acute-angled hoof (fig. 5a) has long overhanging heels,\r\nand a considerable proportion of the weight borne by the leg falls in\r\nthe posterior half of the hoof. For such a hoof the branches of the shoe\r\nshould extend back of the buttresses to a distance nearly double the\r\nthickness of the shoe. For a hoof of the regular form (figs. 5b and 8)\r\nthe branches should project an amount equal to the thickness of the\r\nshoe. In a stumpy hoof (fig. 5c) the shoe need not project more than\r\none-eighth of an inch. In all cases the shoe should cover the entire\r\n\"bearing surface\" of the wall.\r\n\r\n_Surfaces._--The surface that is turned toward the hoof is known as the\r\n\"upper,\" or \"hoof surface,\" of the shoe. That part of the hoof surface\r\nwhich is in actual contact with the horn is called the \"bearing surface\"\r\nof the shoe. The \"bearing surface\" should be perfectly horizontal from\r\nside to side, and wide enough to support the full thickness of the wall,\r\nthe white line, and about an eighth of an inch of the margin of the\r\nsole. The bearing surface should also be perfectly flat, except that it\r\nmay be turned up at the toe (\"rolling-motion\" shoe, fig. 5 a, b,\r\nc.) The surface between the bearing surface and the inner edge of the\r\nshoe is often beaten down or concaved to prevent pressure too far inward\r\nupon the sole. This \"concaving,\" or \"seating,\" should be deeper or\r\nshallower as the horny sole is less or more concave. As a rule, strongly\r\n\"cupped\" soles require no concaving (hind hoofs, narrow fore hoofs).\r\n\r\n_Borders._--The entire outer border should be beveled under the foot.\r\nSuch a shoe is not so readily loosened, nor is it so apt to lead to\r\ninterfering.\r\n\r\n_Fullering._--This is a groove in the ground surface of the shoe. It\r\nshould pass through two-thirds of the thickness of the shoe, be clean,\r\nand of uniform width. It is of advantage in that it makes the shoe\r\nlighter in proportion to its width and, by making the ground surface\r\nsomewhat rough, tends to prevent slipping.\r\n\r\n_Nail holes._--The shoe must be so \"punched\" that the nail holes will\r\nfall directly on the white line. They should be confined to the fore\r\nhalf of front shoes, but may occupy the anterior two-thirds of hind\r\nshoes. For a medium-weight shoe three nail holes in each branch are\r\nsufficient, but for heavier shoes, especially those provided with long\r\ncalks, eight holes are about right, though three on the inside and four\r\non the outside may do.\r\n\r\n_Clips._--These are half-circular ears drawn up from the outer edge of\r\nthe shoe either at the toe or opposite the side wall. The height of a\r\nclip should equal the thickness of the shoe, though they should be even\r\nhigher on hind shoes and when a leather sole is interposed between the\r\nshoe and hoof. Clips secure the shoe against shifting. A side clip\r\nshould always be drawn up on that branch of the shoe that first meets\r\nthe ground in locomotion.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL FEATURES AND FITTING THE SHOES.\r\n\r\n_A shoe for a regular hoof_ (figs. 7 and 8) fits when its outer border\r\nfollows the wall closely in the region of the nail holes and from the\r\nlast nail to the end of the branch gradually projects beyond the surface\r\nof the wall to an eighth of an inch and extends back of the buttresses\r\nan amount equal to the thickness of the shoe. The shoe must be straight,\r\nfirm, air-tight, its nail holes directly over the white line, and its\r\nbranches far enough from the branches of the frog to permit the passage\r\nof a foot pick. Branches of the shoe must be of equal length.\r\n\r\nIn fitting a shoe to a hoof of regular form we follow the form of the\r\nhoof, but in base-wide and base-narrow hoofs, which are of irregular\r\nform, we must pay attention not only to the form of the hoof but also to\r\nthe direction of the pasterns and the consequent distribution of weight\r\nin the hoof, because where the most weight falls the surface of support\r\nof the foot must be widened, and where the least weight falls (opposite\r\nside of the hoof) the surface of support should be narrowed. In this way\r\nthe improper distribution of weight within the hoof is evenly\r\ndistributed over the surface of support.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Left fore hoof of regular form, shod with a\r\nplain \"fullered\" shoe. Note the distribution of the nails, length of the\r\nfuller (crease), and the closeness of the ends of the shoe to the\r\nbranches of the frog.]\r\n\r\n_A shoe for a base-wide hoof_ should be fitted full on the inner side of\r\nthe foot and fitted close on the outer side, because the inner side\r\nbears the most weight. The nails in the outer branch are placed well\r\nback, but in the inner branch are crowded forward toward the toe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Side view of hoof and shoe shown in fig. 7. Note\r\nthe straight toe, weak ring formation running parallel to the coronet,\r\nclinches low down and on a level, length of the shoe, and the\r\nunder-bevel at the toe and heel.]\r\n\r\n_A shoe for a base-narrow hoof_ should be just the reverse of the\r\npreceding. The outer branch should be somewhat longer than the inner.\r\n\r\n_A shoe for an acute-angled hoof_ should be long in the branches,\r\nbecause most of the weight falls in the posterior half of the foot. The\r\nsupport in front should be diminished either by turning the shoe up at\r\nthe toe or by beveling it under the toe (fig. 5a).\r\n\r\n_A shoe for a stumpy hoof_ should be short in the branches, and for\r\npronounced cases should increase the support of the toe, where the most\r\nof the weight falls, by being beveled downward and forward.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, especially in draft horses, where the hoofs stand very\r\nclose together, the coronet of the outer quarter is found to stand out\r\nbeyond the lower border of the quarter. In such cases the outer branch\r\nof the shoe from the last nail back must be fitted so full that an\r\nimaginary perpendicular dropped from the coronet will just meet the\r\nouter border of the shoe. The inner branch, on the other hand, must be\r\nfitted as \"close\" as possible. The principal thought should be to set\r\nthe new shoe farther toward the more strongly worn side. Such a practice\r\nwill render unnecessary the widespread and popular fad of giving the\r\nouter quarter and heel calk of hind shoes an extreme outward bend. Care\r\nshould be taken, however, that in fitting the shoe \"full\" at the quarter\r\nthe bearing surface of the hoof at the quarter be not left unsupported\r\nor incompletely covered, to be pinched and squeezed inward against the\r\nfrog. This will be obviated by making the outer branch of the shoe\r\nsufficiently wide and punching it so coarse that the nails will fall\r\nupon the white line.\r\n\r\n_Hot fitting._--Few farriers have either the time or the skill necessary\r\nto adjust a cold shoe to the hoof so that it will fit, as we say,\r\n\"air-tight.\" Though the opponents of hot fitting draw a lurid picture of\r\nthe direful consequences of applying a hot shoe to the hoof, it is only\r\nthe abuse of the practice that is to be condemned. If a heavy shoe at a\r\nyellow heat be held tightly pressed against a hoof which has been pared\r\ntoo thin, till it embeds itself, serious damage may be done. But a shoe\r\nat a dark heat may be pressed against a properly dressed hoof long\r\nenough to scorch, and thus indicate to the farrier the portions of horn\r\nthat should be lowered without appreciable injury to the hoof and to the\r\nultimate benefit of the animal.\r\n\r\n_Nailing._--The horse owner should insist on the nails being driven low.\r\nThey should pierce the wall not above an inch and five-eighths above the\r\nshoe. A nail penetrating the white line and emerging low on the wall\r\ndestroys the least possible amount of horn, has a wide and strong\r\nclinch, rather than a narrow one, which would be formed near the point\r\nof the nail, and, furthermore, has the strongest possible hold on the\r\nwall, because its clinch is pulling more nearly at a right angle to the\r\ngrain (horn tubes) of the wall than if driven high. Finally, do not\r\nallow the rasp to touch the wall above the clinches.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BAR SHOE.\r\n\r\nThe bar shoe (fig. 9) has a variety of uses. It enables us to give the\r\nfrog pressure, to restore it to its original state of activity and\r\ndevelopment when, by reason of disuse, it has become atrophied. It gives\r\nthe hoof an increased surface of support and enables us to relieve one\r\nor both quarters of undue pressure that may have induced inflammation\r\nand soreness. The bar of the shoe should equal the average width of the\r\nremainder of the shoe and should press but lightly on the branches of\r\nthe frog. The addition of a leather sole with tar and oakum sole-packing\r\nallows us to distribute the weight of the body over the entire ground\r\nsurface of the hoof.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--An acute-angled left fore hoof shod with a bar\r\nshoe. Note the width and position of the bar and the fact that the nails\r\nare placed well toward the toe, so as not to interfere with the\r\nexpansion of the quarters.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--A fairly formed right fore ice shoe for a\r\nroadster. The top and outer-heel calks cut at right angles, and the\r\ninner-heel calk is slender and blunt. The back surface of the toe calk\r\nshould be perpendicular.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RUBBER PAD.\r\n\r\nVarious forms of rubber pads, rubber shoes, rope shoes, fiber shoes, and\r\nother contrivances to diminish shock and prevent slipping on the hard\r\nand slippery pavements of our large cities are in use in different parts\r\nof the world. In Germany the rope shoe (a malleable-iron shoe with a\r\ngroove in its ground surface in which lies a piece of tarred rope) is\r\nextensively used with most gratifying results. It is cheap, durable,\r\neasily applied, and effective.\r\n\r\nIn the large cities of England and the United States rubber pads are\r\nextensively used. They are rather expensive, but are quite efficient in\r\npreventing slipping on polished and gummy pavements, though not so\r\neffective on ice. Figure 11 is an illustration of one of the best of\r\nmany rubber pads. The rubber is stitched and cemented to a leather sole\r\nand is secured by the nails of a three-quarter shoe. Such a pad will\r\nusually last as long as two shoes. They may be used continuously, not\r\nonly without injury to the hoof, but to its great benefit. The belief,\r\nunsupported by evidence, that rubber pads \"draw the feet\" keeps many\r\nfrom using them. A human foot encased in a rubber boot may eventually be\r\nblistered by the sweat poured upon the surface of the skin and held\r\nthere by the impervious rubber till decomposition takes place with the\r\nformation of irritating fatty acids; but there is no basis for an\r\nanalogy in the hoof of a horse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Left fore hoof of regular form shod with a\r\nrubber pad and \"three-quarter\" shoe. (Ground surface.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--A narrow right fore hoof of the base-wide\r\n(toe-wide) standing position, shod with a plain \"dropped-crease\" shoe to\r\nprevent the toe cutting (interfering). The dotted line at the inner toe\r\nindicates the edge of the wall which was rasped away in order to narrow\r\nthe hoof along the striking section. Note the inward bevel of the shoe\r\nat this point, the dropped crease, the distribution of the nails, the\r\nlong \"full\" inner branch, and the short \"close\" outer branch.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER SPECIAL FORMS.\r\n\r\nSome drawings, designed to illustrate shoeing in connection with\r\n\"interfering\" and \"forging,\" and other special conditions, are shown in\r\nfigures 13 to 18.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Hoof surface of a right hind shoe to prevent\r\ninterfering. The inner branch has no nail holes and is fitted and\r\nbeveled under the hoof. Note the number and position of the nail holes,\r\nthe clip on the outer side wall, and the narrowness and bend of the\r\ninner branch.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Ground surface of shoe shown in the previous\r\nfigure. The inner, nailless branch has the thickness of the outer branch\r\nplus its calk, so that the inner and outer quarters of the hoof are\r\nequidistant from the ground.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Side view of a fore hoof shod so as to quicken\r\nthe \"breaking over\" (quicken the action) in a \"forger.\" Note the short\r\nshoe, heel calks inclined forward, and the rolled toe.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Side view of a short-toed hind hoof of a\r\nforger, shod to slow the action and to prevent injury to the fore heels\r\nby the toe of the hind shoe. Note the elevation of the short toe by\r\nmeans of a toe calk and the projection of the toe beyond the shoe. When\r\nsuch a hoof has grown more toe, the toe calk can be dispensed with and\r\nthe shoe set farther forward.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--A toe-weight shoe to increase the length of\r\nstride of fore feet.

The profile of the shoe shows a \"roll\"\r\nat the toe and \"swelled\" heels. The weight is well placed, but \"rolling\"\r\nthe toe and raising the heels lower action. The shoe would be much more\r\neffective if of uniform thickness and with no roll at the toe.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbdomen--\r\n  dropsy, in foal, or ascites, description and treatment, 193\r\n  dropsy, or ascites, description, symptoms, and treatment, 86\r\n  limbs, and perineum, dropsy affecting, description and treatment, 180\r\n  sheath, and penis, swelling, cause and treatment, 171\r\n\r\nAbnormal presentations at birth, 197-202\r\n\r\nAbortion, description, cause, symptoms, and treatment, 182\r\n\r\nAbscess--\r\n  and inflammation of lymphatic glands, descriptions, symptoms,\r\n    treatment, 272\r\n  in lung and suppuration, symptoms, 127\r\n\r\nAbscesses--\r\n  acute, description and treatment, 500\r\n  cold, description and treatment, 501\r\n  description, 500\r\n  in throat, treatment, 62\r\n\r\n_Acari_, parasites of eye, 296\r\n\r\nAcariasis, or mange, note, 478\r\n\r\n_Achorion schoenleini_, vegetable parasite of skin, description, 478\r\n\r\nAdams, John W., chapter on \"Horseshoeing\", 583-605\r\n\r\nAir embolism, or air in veins, note, 270\r\n\r\nAlbuminoid poisoning, hemoglobinuria, azoturia, azotemia, symptoms,\r\nprevention, and treatment, 141\r\n\r\nAloes, use against bots in horses, 93\r\n\r\nAmaurosis, or palsy of nerve of sight, causes, symptoms, and\r\ntreatment, 231, 295\r\n\r\nAmnion, dropsy, description and treatment, 180\r\n\r\nAnasarca, or purpura hemorrhagica, causes, symptoms, treatment, etc., 531,\r\n533\r\n\r\nAnatomy and physiology of brain and nervous system, 210\r\n\r\nAnemia--\r\n  of brain, causes, symptoms, pathology, and treatment, 223\r\n  spinal, symptoms and treatment, 234\r\n\r\nAneurism--\r\n  description, symptoms, pathology, and treatment, 265\r\n  one form caused by _Strongylus vulgaris_, 265\r\n\r\nAnidian monsters, or moles, description, 179\r\n\r\nAnimal parasites, description of kinds, 478\r\n\r\nAnkle--\r\n  and fetlock, skin, note, 397\r\n  fetlock, and foot, diseases, chapter by A.
