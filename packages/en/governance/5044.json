Ford\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe addresses are separated by three asterisks: ***\r\n\r\nDates of addresses by Gerald R. Ford in this eBook:\r\n\r\n  January 15, 1975\r\n  January 19, 1976\r\n  January 12, 1977\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nGerald R. Ford\r\nJanuary 15, 1975\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of the 94th Congress, and\r\ndistinguished guests:\r\n\r\nTwenty-six years ago, a freshman Congressman, a young fellow with lots of\r\nidealism who was out to change the world, stood before Sam Rayburn in the\r\nwell of the House and solemnly swore to the same oath that all of you took\r\nyesterday--an unforgettable experience, and I congratulate you all.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, that same freshman stood at the back of this great\r\nChamber--over there someplace--as President Truman, all charged up by his\r\nsingle-handed election victory, reported as the Constitution requires on\r\nthe state of the Union.\r\n\r\nWhen the bipartisan applause stopped, President Truman said, \"I am happy to\r\nreport to this 81st Congress that the state of the Union is good. Our\r\nNation is better able than ever before to meet the needs of the American\r\npeople, and to give them their fair chance in the pursuit of happiness.\r\n[It] is foremost among the nations of the world in the search for peace.\"\r\n\r\nToday, that freshman Member from Michigan stands where Mr. Truman\r\nstood, and I must say to you that the state of the Union is not good:\r\n\r\nMillions of Americans are out of work.\r\n\r\nRecession and inflation are eroding the money of millions more.\r\n\r\nPrices are too high, and sales are too slow.\r\n\r\nThis year's Federal deficit will be about $30 billion; next year's probably\r\n$45 billion.\r\n\r\nThe national debt will rise to over $500 billion.\r\n\r\nOur plant capacity and productivity are not increasing fast enough.\r\n\r\nWe depend on others for essential energy.\r\n\r\nSome people question their Government's ability to make hard decisions and\r\nstick with them; they expect Washington politics as usual.\r\n\r\nYet, what President Truman said on January 5, 1949, is even more true in\r\n1975. We are better able to meet our people's needs. All Americans do have\r\na fairer chance to pursue happiness. Not only are we still the foremost\r\nnation in the pursuit of peace but today's prospects of attaining it are\r\ninfinitely brighter.\r\n\r\nThere were 59 million Americans employed at the start of 1949; now there\r\nare more than 85 million Americans who have jobs. In comparable dollars,\r\nthe average income of the American family has doubled during the past 26\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nNow, I want to speak very bluntly. I've got bad news, and I don't expect\r\nmuch, if any, applause. The American people want action, and it will take\r\nboth the Congress and the President to give them what they want. Progress\r\nand solutions can be achieved, and they will be achieved.\r\n\r\nMy message today is not intended to address all of the complex needs of\r\nAmerica. I will send separate messages making specific recommendations for\r\ndomestic legislation, such as the extension of general revenue sharing and\r\nthe Voting Rights Act.\r\n\r\nThe moment has come to move in a new direction. We can do this by\r\nfashioning a new partnership between the Congress on the one hand, the\r\nWhite House on the other, and the people we both represent.\r\n\r\nLet us mobilize the most powerful and most creative industrial nation that\r\never existed on this Earth to put all our people to work. The emphasis on\r\nour economic efforts must now shift from inflation to jobs.\r\n\r\nTo bolster business and industry and to create new jobs, I propose a 1-year\r\ntax reduction of $16 billion. Three-quarters would go to individuals and\r\none-quarter to promote business investment.\r\n\r\nThis cash rebate to individuals amounts to 12 percent of 1974 tax\r\npayments--a total cut of $12 billion, with a maximum of $1,000 per return.\r\n\r\nI call on the Congress to act by April 1. If you do--and I hope you\r\nwill--the Treasury can send the first check for half of the rebate in May\r\nand the second by September.\r\n\r\nThe other one-fourth of the cut, about $4 billion, will go to business,\r\nincluding farms, to promote expansion and to create more jobs. The 1-year\r\nreduction for businesses would be in the form of a liberalized investment\r\ntax credit increasing the rate to 12 percent for all businesses.\r\n\r\nThis tax cut does not include the more fundamental reforms needed in our\r\ntax system. But it points us in the right direction--allowing taxpayers\r\nrather than the Government to spend their pay.\r\n\r\nCutting taxes now is essential if we are to turn the economy around. A tax\r\ncut offers the best hope of creating more jobs. Unfortunately, it will\r\nincrease the size of the budget deficit. Therefore, it is more important\r\nthan ever that we take steps to control the growth of Federal\r\nexpenditures.\r\n\r\nPart of our trouble is that we have been self-indulgent. For decades, we\r\nhave been voting ever-increasing levels of Government benefits, and now the\r\nbill has come due. We have been adding so many new programs that the size\r\nand the growth of the Federal budget has taken on a life of its own.\r\n\r\nOne characteristic of these programs is that their cost increases\r\nautomatically every year because the number of people eligible for most of\r\nthe benefits increases every year. When these programs are enacted, there\r\nis no dollar amount set. No one knows what they will cost. All we know is\r\nthat whatever they cost last year, they will cost more next year.\r\n\r\nIt is a question of simple arithmetic. Unless we check the excessive growth\r\nof Federal expenditures or impose on ourselves matching increases in taxes,\r\nwe will continue to run huge inflationary deficits in the Federal budget.\r\n\r\nIf we project the current built-in momentum of Federal spending through the\r\nnext 15 years, State, Federal, and local government expenditures could\r\neasily comprise half of our gross national product. This compares with less\r\nthan a third in 1975.\r\n\r\nI have just concluded the process of preparing the budget submissions for\r\nfiscal year 1976. In that budget, I will propose legislation to restrain\r\nthe growth of a number of existing programs. I have also concluded that no\r\nnew spending programs can be initiated this year, except for energy.\r\nFurther, I will not hesitate to veto any new spending programs adopted by\r\nthe Congress.\r\n\r\nAs an additional step toward putting the Federal Government's house in\r\norder, I recommend a 5-percent limit on Federal pay increases in 1975. In\r\nall Government programs tied to the Consumer Price Index--including social\r\nsecurity, civil service and military retirement pay, and food stamps--I\r\nalso propose a 1-year maximum increase of 5 percent.\r\n\r\nNone of these recommended ceiling limitations, over which Congress has\r\nfinal authority, are easy to propose, because in most cases they involve\r\nanticipated payments to many, many deserving people. Nonetheless, it must\r\nbe done. I must emphasize that I am not asking to eliminate, to reduce, to\r\nfreeze these payments. I am merely recommending that we slow down the rate\r\nat which these payments increase and these programs grow.\r\n\r\nOnly a reduction in the growth of spending can keep Federal borrowing down\r\nand reduce the damage to the private sector from high interest rates. Only\r\na reduction in spending can make it possible for the Federal Reserve System\r\nto avoid an inflationary growth in the money supply and thus restore\r\nbalance to our economy. A major reduction in the growth of Federal spending\r\ncan help dispel the uncertainty that so many feel about our economy and put\r\nus on the way to curing our economic ills.\r\n\r\nIf we don't act to slow down the rate of increase in Federal spending, the\r\nUnited States Treasury will be legally obligated to spend more than $360\r\nbillion in fiscal year 1976, even if no new programs are enacted. These are\r\nnot matters of conjecture or prediction, but again, a matter of simple\r\narithmetic. The size of these numbers and their implications for our\r\neveryday life and the health of our economic system are shocking.\r\n\r\nI submitted to the last Congress a list of budget deferrals and\r\nrescissions. There will be more cuts recommended in the budget that I will\r\nsubmit. Even so, the level of outlays for fiscal year 1976 is still much,\r\nmuch too high. Not only is it too high for this year but the decisions we\r\nmake now will inevitably have a major and growing impact on expenditure\r\nlevels in future years. I think this is a very fundamental issue that we,\r\nthe Congress and I, must jointly solve.\r\n\r\nEconomic disruptions we and others are experiencing stem in part from the\r\nfact that the world price of petroleum has quadrupled in the last year. But\r\nin all honesty, we cannot put all of the blame on the oil-exporting\r\nnations. We, the United States, are not blameless. Our growing dependence\r\nupon foreign sources has been adding to our vulnerability for years and\r\nyears, and we did nothing to prepare ourselves for such an event as the\r\nembargo of 1973.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1960's, this country had a surplus capacity of crude oil which\r\nwe were able to make available to our trading partners whenever there was a\r\ndisruption of supply. This surplus capacity enabled us to influence both\r\nsupplies and prices of crude oil throughout the world. Our excess capacity\r\nneutralized any effort at establishing an effective cartel, and thus the\r\nrest of the world was assured of adequate supplies of oil at reasonable\r\nprices.\r\n\r\nBy 1970, our surplus capacity had vanished, and as a consequence, the\r\nlatent power of the oil cartel could emerge in full force. Europe and\r\nJapan, both heavily dependent on imported oil, now struggle to keep their\r\neconomies in balance. Even the United States, our country, which is far\r\nmore self-sufficient than most other industrial countries, has been .put\r\nunder serious pressure.\r\n\r\nI am proposing a program which will begin to restore our country's surplus\r\ncapacity in total energy. In this way, we will be able to assure ourselves\r\nreliable and adequate energy and help foster a new world energy stability\r\nfor other major consuming nations.\r\n\r\nBut this Nation and, in fact, the world must face the prospect of energy\r\ndifficulties between now and 1985. This program will impose burdens on all\r\nof us with the aim of reducing our consumption of energy and increasing our\r\nproduction. Great attention has been paid to the considerations of\r\nfairness, and I can assure you that the burdens will not fall more harshly\r\non those less able to bear them.\r\n\r\nI am recommending a plan to make us invulnerable to cutoffs of foreign oil.\r\nIt will require sacrifices, but it--and this is most important--it will\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nI have set the following national energy goals to assure that our future is\r\nas secure and as productive as our past:\r\n\r\nFirst, we must reduce oil imports by 1 million barrels per day by the end\r\nof this year and by 2 million barrels per day by the end of 1977.\r\n\r\nSecond, we must end vulnerability to economic disruption by foreign\r\nsuppliers by 1985.\r\n\r\nThird, we must develop our energy technology and resources so that the\r\nUnited States has the ability to supply a significant share of the energy\r\nneeds of the free world by the end of this century.\r\n\r\nTo attain these objectives, we need immediate action to cut imports.\r\nUnfortunately, in the short term there are only a limited number of actions\r\nwhich can increase domestic supply. I will press for all of them.\r\n\r\nI urge quick action on the necessary legislation to allow commercial\r\nproduction at the Elk Hills, California, Naval Petroleum Reserve. In order\r\nthat we make greater use of domestic coal resources, I am submitting\r\namendments to the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act which\r\nwill greatly increase the number of powerplants that can be promptly\r\nconverted to coal.\r\n\r\nObviously, voluntary conservation continues to be essential, but tougher\r\nprograms are needed--and needed now. Therefore, I am using Presidential\r\npowers to raise the fee on all imported crude oil and petroleum products.\r\nThe crude oil fee level will be increased $1 per barrel on February 1, by\r\n$2 per barrel on March 1, and by $3 per barrel on April 1. I will take\r\nactions to reduce undue hardships on any geographical region. The foregoing\r\nare interim administrative actions. They will be rescinded when the broader\r\nbut necessary legislation is enacted.\r\n\r\nTo that end, I am requesting the Congress to act within 90 days on a more\r\ncomprehensive energy tax program. It includes: excise taxes and import fees\r\ntotaling $2 per barrel on product imports and on all crude oil;\r\nderegulation of new natural gas and enactment of a natural gas excise tax.\r\n\r\nI plan to take Presidential initiative to decontrol the price of domestic\r\ncrude oil on April 1. I urge the Congress to enact a windfall profits tax\r\nby that date to ensure that oil producers do not profit unduly.\r\n\r\nThe sooner Congress acts, the more effective the oil conservation program\r\nwill be and the quicker the Federal revenues can be returned to our\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nI am prepared to use Presidential authority to limit imports, as necessary,\r\nto guarantee success.\r\n\r\nI want you to know that before deciding on my energy conservation program,\r\nI considered rationing and higher gasoline taxes as alternatives. In my\r\njudgment, neither would achieve the desired results and both would produce\r\nunacceptable inequities.\r\n\r\nA massive program must be initiated to increase energy supply, to cut\r\ndemand, and provide new standby emergency programs to achieve the\r\nindependence we want by 1985. The largest part of increased oil production\r\nmust come from new frontier areas on the Outer Continental Shelf and from\r\nthe Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 4 in Alaska. It is the intent of this\r\nAdministration to move ahead with exploration, leasing, and production on\r\nthose frontier areas of the Outer Continental Shelf where the environmental\r\nrisks are acceptable.\r\n\r\nUse of our most abundant domestic resource--coal--is severely limited. We\r\nmust strike a reasonable compromise on environmental concerns with coal. I\r\nam submitting Clean Air amendments which will allow greater coal use\r\nwithout sacrificing clean air goals.\r\n\r\nI vetoed the strip mining legislation passed by the last Congress. With\r\nappropriate changes, I will sign a revised version when it comes to the\r\nWhite House.\r\n\r\nI am proposing a number of actions to energize our nuclear power program. I\r\nwill submit legislation to expedite nuclear leasing and the\r\nrapid selection of sites.\r\n\r\nIn recent months, utilities have cancelled or postponed over 60 percent of\r\nplanned nuclear expansion and 30 percent of planned additions to\r\nnon-nuclear capacity. Financing problems for that industry are worsening. I\r\nam therefore recommending that the 1-year investment tax credit of 12\r\npercent be extended an additional 2 years to specifically speed the\r\nconstruction of powerplants that do not use natural gas or oil. I am also\r\nsubmitting proposals for selective reform of State utility commission\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\nTo provide the critical stability for our domestic energy production in the\r\nface of world price uncertainty, I will request legislation to authorize\r\nand require tariffs, import quotas, or price floors to protect our energy\r\nprices at levels which will achieve energy independence.\r\n\r\nIncreasing energy supplies is not enough. We must take additional steps to\r\ncut long-term consumption. I therefore propose to the Congress: legislation\r\nto make thermal efficiency standards mandatory for all new buildings in the\r\nUnited States; a new tax credit of up to $150 for those homeowners who\r\ninstall insulation equipment; the establishment of an energy conservation\r\nprogram to help low-income families purchase insulation supplies;\r\nlegislation to modify and defer automotive pollution standards for 5 years,\r\nwhich will enable us to improve automobile gas mileage by 40 percent by\r\n1980.\r\n\r\nThese proposals and actions, cumulatively, can reduce our dependence on\r\nforeign energy supplies from 3 to 5 million barrels per day by 1985. To\r\nmake the United States invulnerable to foreign disruption, I propose\r\nstandby emergency legislation and a strategic storage program of 1 billion\r\nbarrels of oil for domestic needs and 300 million barrels for national\r\ndefense purposes.\r\n\r\nI will ask for the funds needed for energy research and development\r\nactivities. I have established a goal of 1 million barrels of synthetic\r\nfuels and shale oil production per day by 1985 together with an incentive\r\nprogram to achieve it.\r\n\r\nI have a very deep belief in America's capabilities. Within the next 10\r\nyears, my program envisions: 200 major nuclear powerplants; 250 major new\r\ncoal mines; 150 major coal-fired powerplants; 30 major new refineries; 20\r\nmajor new synthetic fuel plants; the drilling of many thousands of new\r\noil wells; the insulation of 18 million homes; and the manufacturing\r\nand the sale of millions of new automobiles, trucks, and buses that\r\nuse much less fuel.\r\n\r\nI happen to believe that we can do it. In another crisis--the one in 1942\r\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt said this country would build 60,000\r\nmilitary aircraft. By 1943, production in that program had reached\r\n125,000 aircraft annually. They did it then. We can do it now.\r\n\r\nIf the Congress and the American people will work with me to attain these\r\ntargets, they will be achieved and will be surpassed. From adversity, let\r\nus seize opportunity. Revenues of some $30 billion from higher energy taxes\r\ndesigned to encourage conservation must be refunded to the American people\r\nin a manner which corrects distortions in our tax system wrought by\r\ninflation.\r\n\r\nPeople have been pushed into higher tax brackets by inflation, with\r\nconsequent reduction in their actual spending power. Business taxes are\r\nsimilarly distorted because inflation exaggerates reported profits,\r\nresulting in excessive taxes.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I propose that future individual income taxes be reduced by\r\n$16.5 billion. This will be done by raising the low-income allowance and\r\nreducing tax rates. This continuing tax cut will primarily benefit lower-\r\nand middle-income taxpayers.\r\n\r\nFor example, a typical family of four with a gross income of $5,600 now\r\npays $185 in Federal income taxes. Under this tax cut plan, they would pay\r\nnothing. A family of four with a gross income of $12,500 now pays $1,260 in\r\nFederal taxes. My proposal reduces that total by $300. Families grossing\r\n$20,000 would receive a reduction of $210.\r\n\r\nThose with the very lowest incomes, who can least afford higher costs, must\r\nalso be compensated. I propose a payment of $80 to every person 18 years of\r\nage and older in that very limited category.\r\n\r\nState and local governments will receive $2 billion in additional revenue\r\nsharing to offset their increased energy costs.\r\n\r\nTo offset inflationary distortions and to generate more economic activity,\r\nthe corporate tax rate will be reduced from 48 percent to 42 percent.\r\n\r\nNow let me turn, if I might, to the international dimension of the present\r\ncrisis. At no time in our peacetime history has the state of the Nation\r\ndepended more heavily on the state of the world. And seldom, if ever, has\r\nthe state of the world depended more heavily on the state of our Nation.\r\n\r\nThe economic distress is global. We will not solve it at home unless we\r\nhelp to remedy the profound economic dislocation abroad. World trade and\r\nmonetary structure provides markets, energy, food, and vital raw\r\nmaterials--for all nations. This international system is now in jeopardy.\r\n\r\nThis Nation can be proud of significant achievements in recent years in\r\nsolving problems and crises. The Berlin agreement, the SALT agreements, our\r\nnew relationship with China, the unprecedented efforts in the Middle East\r\nare immensely encouraging. But the world is not free from crisis. In a\r\nworld of 150 nations, where nuclear technology is proliferating and\r\nregional conflicts continue, international security cannot be taken for\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\nSo, let there be no mistake about it: International cooperation is a vital\r\nfactor of our lives today. This is not a moment for the American people to\r\nturn inward. More than ever before, our own well-being depends on America's\r\ndetermination and America's leadership in the whole wide world.\r\n\r\nWe are a great Nation--spiritually, politically, militarily,\r\ndiplomatically, and economically. America's commitment to international\r\nsecurity has sustained the safety of allies and friends in many areas--in\r\nthe Middle East, in Europe, and in Asia. Our turning away would unleash new\r\ninstabilities, new dangers around the globe, which, in turn, would threaten\r\nour own security.\r\n\r\nAt the end of World War II, we turned a similar challenge into an historic\r\nopportunity and, I might add, an historic achievement. An old order was in\r\ndisarray; political and economic institutions were shattered. In that\r\nperiod, this Nation and its partners built new institutions, new mechanisms\r\nof mutual support and cooperation. Today, as then, we face an historic\r\nopportunity. If we act imaginatively and boldly, as we acted then, this\r\nperiod will in retrospect be seen as one of the great creative moments of\r\nour Nation's history. The whole world is watching to see how we respond.\r\n\r\nA resurgent American economy would do more to restore the confidence of the\r\nworld in its own future than anything else we can do. The program that this\r\nCongress passes can demonstrate to the world that we have started to put\r\nour own house in order. If we can show that this Nation is able and willing\r\nto help other nations meet the common challenge, it can demonstrate that\r\nthe United States will fulfill its responsibilities as a leader among\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nQuite frankly, at stake is the future of industrialized democracies, which\r\nhave perceived their destiny in common and sustained it in common for 30\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe developing nations are also at a turning point. The poorest nations see\r\ntheir hopes of feeding their hungry and developing their societies\r\nshattered by the economic crisis. The long-term economic future for the\r\nproducers of raw materials also depends on cooperative solutions.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the Communist countries are a basic factor of the world\r\nenvironment. We must seek to build a long-term basis for coexistence. We\r\nwill stand by our principles. We will stand by our interests. We will act\r\nfirmly when challenged. The kind of a world we want depends on a broad\r\npolicy of creating mutual incentives for restraint and for cooperation.\r\n\r\nAs we move forward to meet our global challenges and opportunities, we must\r\nhave the tools to do the job.\r\n\r\nOur military forces are strong and ready. This military strength deters\r\naggression against our allies, stabilizes our relations with former\r\nadversaries, and protects our homeland. Fully adequate conventional and\r\nstrategic forces cost many, many billions, but these dollars are sound\r\ninsurance for our safety and for a more peaceful world.\r\n\r\nMilitary strength alone is not sufficient. Effective diplomacy is also\r\nessential in preventing conflict, in building world understanding. The\r\nVladivostok negotiations with the Soviet Union represent a major step in\r\nmoderating strategic arms competition. My recent discussions with the\r\nleaders of the Atlantic community, Japan, and South Korea have contributed\r\nto meeting the common challenge.\r\n\r\nBut we have serious problems before us that require cooperation between the\r\nPresident and the Congress. By the Constitution and tradition, the\r\nexecution of foreign policy is the responsibility of the President.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, under the stress of the Vietnam war, legislative\r\nrestrictions on the President's ability to execute foreign policy and\r\nmilitary decisions have proliferated. As a Member of the Congress, I\r\nopposed some and I approved others. As President, I welcome the advice and\r\ncooperation of the House and the Senate.\r\n\r\nBut if our foreign policy is to be successful, we cannot rigidly restrict\r\nin legislation the ability of the President to act. The conduct of\r\nnegotiations is ill-suited to such limitations. Legislative restrictions,\r\nintended for the best motives and purposes, can have the opposite result,\r\nas we have seen most recently in our trade relations with the Soviet\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I pledge this Administration will act in the closest\r\nconsultation with the Congress as we face delicate situations and troubled\r\ntimes throughout the globe.\r\n\r\nWhen I became President only 5 months ago, I promised the last Congress a\r\npolicy of communication, conciliation, compromise, and cooperation. I renew\r\nthat pledge to the new Members of this Congress.\r\n\r\nLet me sum it up. America needs a new direction, which I have sought to\r\nchart here today--a change of course which will: put the unemployed back to\r\nwork; increase real income and production; restrain the growth of Federal\r\nGovernment spending; achieve energy independence; and advance the cause of\r\nworld understanding.\r\n\r\nWe have the ability. We have the know-how. In partnership with the American\r\npeople, we will achieve these objectives.\r\n\r\nAs our 200th anniversary approaches, we owe it to ourselves and to\r\nposterity to rebuild our political and economic strength. Let us make\r\nAmerica once again and for centuries more to come what it has so long\r\nbeen--a stronghold and a beacon-light of liberty for the whole world.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nGerald R. Ford\r\nJanuary 19, 1976\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of the 94th Congress, and\r\ndistinguished guests:\r\n\r\nAs we begin our Bicentennial, America is still one of the youngest nations\r\nin recorded history. Long before our forefathers came to these shores, men\r\nand women had been struggling on this planet to forge a better life for\r\nthemselves and their families.\r\n\r\nIn man's long, upward march from savagery and slavery--throughout the\r\nnearly 2,000 years of the Christian calendar, the nearly 6,000 years of\r\nJewish reckoning--there have been many deep, terrifying valleys, but also\r\nmany bright and towering peaks.\r\n\r\nOne peak stands highest in the ranges of human history. One example shines\r\nforth of a people uniting to produce abundance and to share the good life\r\nfairly and with freedom. One union holds out the promise of justice and\r\nopportunity for every citizen: That union is the United States of America.\r\n\r\nWe have not remade paradise on Earth. We know perfection will not be found\r\nhere. But think for a minute how far we have come in 200 years.\r\n\r\nWe came from many roots, and we have many branches. Yet all Americans\r\nacross the eight generations that separate us from the stirring deeds of\r\n1776, those who know no other homeland and those who just found refuge\r\namong our shores, say in unison:\r\n\r\nI am proud of America, and I am proud to be an American. Life will be a\r\nlittle better here for my children than for me. I believe this not because\r\nI am told to believe it, but because life has been better for me than it\r\nwas for my father and my mother. I know it will be better for my children\r\nbecause my hands, my brains, my voice, and my vote can help make it\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\nIt has happened here in America. It has happened to you and to me.\r\nGovernment exists to create and preserve conditions in which people can\r\ntranslate their ideas into practical reality. In the best of times, much is\r\nlost in translation. But we try. Sometimes we have tried and failed. Always\r\nwe have had the best of intentions.\r\n\r\nBut in the recent past, we sometimes forgot the sound principles that\r\nguided us through most of our history. We wanted to accomplish great things\r\nand solve age-old problems. And we became overconfident of our abilities.\r\nWe tried to be a policeman abroad and the indulgent parent here at home.\r\n\r\nWe thought we could transform the country through massive national\r\nprograms, but often the programs did not work. Too often they only made\r\nthings worse. In our rush to accomplish great deeds quickly, we trampled on\r\nsound principles of restraint and endangered the rights of individuals. We\r\nunbalanced our economic system by the huge and unprecedented growth of\r\nFederal expenditures and borrowing. And we were not totally honest with\r\nourselves about how much these programs would cost and how we would pay for\r\nthem. Finally, we shifted our emphasis from defense to domestic problems\r\nwhile our adversaries continued a massive buildup of arms.\r\n\r\nThe time has now come for a fundamentally different approach for a new\r\nrealism that is true to the great principles upon which this Nation was\r\nfounded.\r\n\r\nWe must introduce a new balance to our economy--a balance that favors not\r\nonly sound, active government but also a much more vigorous, healthy\r\neconomy that can create new jobs and hold down prices.\r\n\r\nWe must introduce a new balance in the relationship between the individual\r\nand the government--a balance that favors greater individual freedom and\r\nself-reliance.\r\n\r\nWe must strike a new balance in our system of federalism--a balance that\r\nfavors greater responsibility and freedom for the leaders of our State and\r\nlocal governments.\r\n\r\nWe must introduce a new balance between the spending on domestic programs\r\nand spending on defense--a balance that ensures we will fully meet our\r\nobligation to the needy while also protecting our security in a world that\r\nis still hostile to freedom.\r\n\r\nAnd in all that we do, we must be more honest with the American people,\r\npromising them no more than we can deliver and delivering all that we\r\npromise.\r\n\r\nThe genius of America has been its incredible ability to improve the lives\r\nof its citizens through a unique combination of governmental and free\r\ncitizen activity.\r\n\r\nHistory and experience tells us that moral progress cannot come in\r\ncomfortable and in complacent times, but out of trial and out of confusion.\r\nTom Paine aroused the troubled Americans of 1776 to stand up to the times\r\nthat try men's souls because the harder the conflict, the more glorious the\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nJust a year ago I reported that the state of the Union was not good.\r\nTonight, I report that the state of our Union is better--in many ways a lot\r\nbetter--but still not good enough.\r\n\r\nTo paraphrase Tom Paine, 1975 was not a year for summer soldiers and\r\nsunshine patriots. It was a year of fears and alarms and of dire\r\nforecasts--most of which never happened and won't happen.\r\n\r\nAs you recall, the year 1975 opened with rancor and with bitterness.\r\nPolitical misdeeds of the past had neither been forgotten nor forgiven. The\r\nlongest, most divisive war in our history was winding toward an unhappy\r\nconclusion. Many feared that the end of that foreign war of men and\r\nmachines meant the beginning of a domestic war of recrimination and\r\nreprisal. Friends and adversaries abroad were asking whether America had\r\nlost its nerve. Finally, our economy was ravaged by inflation--inflation\r\nthat was plunging us into the worst recession in four decades. At the same\r\ntime, Americans became increasingly alienated from big institutions. They\r\nwere steadily losing confidence, not just in big government but in big\r\nbusiness, big labor, and big education, among others. Ours was a troubled\r\nland.\r\n\r\nAnd so, 1975 was a year of hard decisions, difficult compromises, and a new\r\nrealism that taught us something important about America. It brought back a\r\nneeded measure of common sense, steadfastness, and self-discipline.\r\n\r\nAmericans did not panic or demand instant but useless cures. In all\r\nsectors, people met their difficult problems with the restraint and with\r\nresponsibility worthy of their great heritage.\r\n\r\nAdd up the separate pieces of progress in 1975, subtract the setbacks, and\r\nthe sum total shows that we are not only headed in a new direction, a\r\ndirection which I proposed 12 months ago, but it turned out to be the right\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nIt is the right direction because it follows the truly revolutionary\r\nAmerican concept of 1776, which holds that in a free society the making of\r\npublic policy and successful problem-solving involves much more than\r\ngovernment. It involves a full partnership among all branches and all\r\nlevels of government, private institutions, and individual citizens.\r\n\r\nCommon sense tells me to stick to that steady course.\r\n\r\nTake the state of our economy. Last January, most things were rapidly\r\ngetting worse. This January, most things are slowly but surely getting\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nThe worst recession since World War II turned around in April. The best\r\ncost-of-living news of the past year is that double-digit inflation of 12\r\npercent or higher was cut almost in half. The worst--unemployment remains\r\nfar too high.\r\n\r\nToday, nearly 1,700,000 more Americans are working than at the bottom of\r\nthe recession. At year's end, people were again being hired much faster\r\nthan they were being laid off.\r\n\r\nYet, let's be honest. Many Americans have not yet felt these changes in\r\ntheir daily lives. They still see prices going up far too fast, and they\r\nstill know the fear of unemployment.\r\n\r\nWe are also a growing nation. We need more and more jobs every year.\r\nToday's economy has produced over 85 million jobs for Americans, but we\r\nneed a lot more jobs, especially for the young.\r\n\r\nMy first objective is to have sound economic growth without inflation.\r\n\r\nWe all know from recent experience what runaway inflation does to ruin\r\nevery other worthy purpose. We are slowing it. We must stop it cold.\r\n\r\nFor many Americans, the way to a healthy, noninflationary economy has\r\nbecome increasingly apparent. The Government must stop spending so much and\r\nstop borrowing so much of our money. More money must remain in private\r\nhands where it will do the most good. To hold down the cost of living, we\r\nmust hold down the cost of government.\r\n\r\nIn the past decade, the Federal budget has been growing at an average rate\r\nof over 10 percent a year. The budget I am submitting Wednesday cuts this\r\nrate of growth in half. I have kept my promise to submit a budget for the\r\nnext fiscal year of $395 billion. In fact, it is $394.2 billion.\r\n\r\nBy holding down the growth of Federal spending, we can afford additional\r\ntax cuts and return to the people who pay taxes more decisionmaking power\r\nover their own lives.\r\n\r\nLast month I signed legislation to extend the 1975 tax reductions for the\r\nfirst 6 months of this year. I now propose that effective July 1, 1976, we\r\ngive our taxpayers a tax cut of approximately $10 billion more than\r\nCongress agreed to in December.\r\n\r\nMy broader tax reduction would mean that for a family of four making\r\n$15,000 a year, there will be $227 more in take-home pay annually.\r\nHardworking Americans caught in the middle can really use that kind of\r\nextra cash.\r\n\r\nMy recommendations for a firm restraint on the growth of Federal spending\r\nand for greater tax reduction are simple and straightforward. For every\r\ndollar saved in cutting the growth in the Federal budget, we can have an\r\nadded dollar of Federal tax reduction.\r\n\r\nWe can achieve a balanced budget by 1979 if we have the courage and the\r\nwisdom to continue to reduce the growth of Federal spending.\r\n\r\nOne test of a healthy economy is a job for every American who wants to\r\nwork. Government--our kind of government--cannot create that many jobs. But\r\nthe Federal Government can create conditions and incentives for private\r\nbusiness and industry to make more and more jobs.\r\n\r\nFive out of six jobs in this country are in private business and in\r\nindustry. Common sense tells us this is the place to look for more jobs and\r\nto find them faster. I mean real, rewarding, permanent jobs.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this we must offer the American people greater incentives to\r\ninvest in the future. My tax proposals are a major step in that direction.\r\nTo supplement these proposals, I ask that Congress enact changes in Federal\r\ntax laws that will speed up plant expansion and the purchase of new\r\nequipment. My recommendations will concentrate this job-creation tax\r\nincentive in areas where the unemployment rate now runs over 7 percent.\r\nLegislation to get this started must be approved at the earliest possible\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nWithin the strict budget total that I will recommend for the coming year, I\r\nwill ask for additional housing assistance for 500,000 families. These\r\nprograms will expand housing opportunities, spur construction, and help to\r\nhouse moderate- and low-income families.\r\n\r\nWe had a disappointing year in the housing industry in 1975. But with lower\r\ninterest rates and available mortgage money, we can have a healthy recovery\r\nin 1976.\r\n\r\nA necessary condition of a healthy economy is freedom from the petty\r\ntyranny of massive government regulation. We are wasting literally millions\r\nof working hours costing billions of taxpayers' and consumers' dollars\r\nbecause of bureaucratic redtape. The American farmer, who now feeds 215\r\nmillion Americans, but also millions worldwide, has shown how much more he\r\ncan produce without the shackles of government control.\r\n\r\nNow, we badly need reforms in other key areas in our economy: the airlines,\r\ntrucking, railroads, and financial institutions. I have submitted concrete\r\nplans in each of these areas, not to help this or that industry, but to\r\nfoster competition and to bring prices down for the consumer.\r\n\r\nThis administration, in addition, will strictly enforce the Federal\r\nantitrust laws for the very same purposes.\r\n\r\nTaking a longer look at America's future, there can be neither sustained\r\ngrowth nor more jobs unless we continue to have an assured supply of energy\r\nto run our economy. Domestic production of oil and gas is still declining.\r\nOur dependence on foreign oil at high prices is still too great, draining\r\njobs and dollars away from our own economy at the rate of $125 per year for\r\nevery American.\r\n\r\nLast month, I signed a compromise national energy bill which enacts a part\r\nof my comprehensive energy independence program. This legislation was late,\r\nnot the complete answer to energy independence, but still a start in the\r\nright direction.\r\n\r\nI again urge the Congress to move ahead immediately on the remainder of my\r\nenergy proposals to make America invulnerable to the foreign oil cartel.\r\n\r\nMy proposals, as all of you know, would reduce domestic natural gas\r\nshortages; allow production from Federal petroleum reserves; stimulate\r\neffective conservation, including revitalization of our railroads and the\r\nexpansion of our urban transportation systems; develop more and cleaner\r\nenergy from our vast coal resources; expedite clean and safe nuclear power\r\nproduction; create a new national energy independence authority to\r\nstimulate vital energy investment; and accelerate development of technology\r\nto capture energy from the Sun and the Earth for this and future\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nAlso, I ask, for the sake of future generations, that we preserve the\r\nfamily farm and family-owned small business. Both strengthen America and\r\ngive stability to our economy. I will propose estate tax changes so that\r\nfamily businesses and family farms can be handed down from generation to\r\ngeneration without having to be sold to pay taxes.\r\n\r\nI propose tax changes to encourage people to invest in America's future,\r\nand their own, through a plan that gives moderate-income families income\r\ntax benefits if they make long-term investments in common stock in American\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Government must and will respond to clear-cut national\r\nneeds--for this and future generations.\r\n\r\nHospital and medical services in America are among the best in the world,\r\nbut the cost of a serious and extended illness can quickly wipe out a\r\nfamily's lifetime savings. Increasing health costs are of deep concern to\r\nall and a powerful force pushing up the cost of living. The burden of\r\ncatastrophic illness can be borne by very few in our society. We must\r\neliminate this fear from every family.\r\n\r\nI propose catastrophic health insurance for everybody covered by Medicare.\r\nTo finance this added protection, fees for short-term care will go up\r\nsomewhat, but nobody after reaching age 65 will have to pay more than $500\r\na year for covered hospital or nursing home care, nor more than $250 for 1\r\nyear's doctor bills.\r\n\r\nWe cannot realistically afford federally dictated national health insurance\r\nproviding full coverage for all 215 million Americans. The experience of\r\nother countries raises questions about the quality as well as the cost of\r\nsuch plans. But I do envision the day when we may use the private health\r\ninsurance system to offer more middle-income families high quality health\r\nservices at prices they can afford and shield them also from their\r\ncatastrophic illnesses.\r\n\r\nUsing resources now available, I propose improving the Medicare and other\r\nFederal health programs to help those who really need protection--older\r\npeople and the poor. To help States and local governments give better\r\nhealth care to the poor, I propose that we combine 16 existing Federal\r\nprograms, including Medicaid, into a single $10 billion Federal grant.\r\n\r\nFunds would be divided among States under a new formula which provides a\r\nlarger share of Federal money to those States that have a larger share of\r\nlow-income families.\r\n\r\nI will take further steps to improve the quality of medical and hospital\r\ncare for those who have served in our Armed Forces.\r\n\r\nNow let me speak about social security. Our Federal social security system\r\nfor people who have worked and contributed to it for all their lives is a\r\nvital part of our economic system. Its value is no longer debatable. In my\r\nbudget for fiscal year 1977, I am recommending that the full cost-of-living\r\nincreases in the social security benefits be paid during the coming year.\r\n\r\nBut I am concerned about the integrity of our Social Security Trust Fund\r\nthat enables people--those retired and those still working who will\r\nretire--to count on this source of retirement income. Younger workers watch\r\ntheir deductions rise and wonder if they will be adequately protected in\r\nthe future. We must meet this challenge head on. Simple arithmetic warns\r\nall of us that the Social Security Trust Fund is headed for trouble. Unless\r\nwe act soon to make sure the fund takes in as much as it pays out, there\r\nwill be no security for old or for young.\r\n\r\nI must, therefore, recommend a three-tenths of 1 percent increase in both\r\nemployer and employee social security taxes effective January 1, 1977. This\r\nwill cost each covered employee less than 1 extra dollar a week and will\r\nensure the integrity of the trust fund.\r\n\r\nAs we rebuild our economy, we have a continuing responsibility to provide a\r\ntemporary cushion to the unemployed. At my request, the Congress enacted\r\ntwo extensions and two expansions in unemployment insurance which helped\r\nthose who were jobless during 1975. These programs will continue in 1976.\r\n\r\nIn my fiscal year 1977 budget, I am also requesting funds to continue\r\nproven job training and employment opportunity programs for millions of\r\nother Americans.\r\n\r\nCompassion and a sense of community--two of America's greatest strengths\r\nthroughout our history--tell us we must take care of our neighbors who\r\ncannot take care of themselves. The host of Federal programs in this field\r\nreflect our generosity as a people.\r\n\r\nBut everyone realizes that when it comes to welfare, government at all\r\nlevels is not doing the job well. Too many of our welfare programs are\r\ninequitable and invite abuse. Too many of our welfare programs have\r\nproblems from beginning to end. Worse, we are wasting badly needed\r\nresources without reaching many of the truly needy.\r\n\r\nComplex welfare programs cannot be reformed overnight. Surely we cannot\r\nsimply dump welfare into the laps of the 50 States, their local taxpayers,\r\nor their private charities, and just walk away from it. Nor is it the right\r\ntime for massive and sweeping changes while we are still recovering from\r\nthe recession.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there are still plenty of improvements that we can make. I\r\nwill ask Congress for Presidential authority to tighten up the rules for\r\neligibility and benefits.\r\n\r\nLast year I twice sought long overdue reform of the scandal-riddled food\r\nstamp program. This year I say again: Let's give food stamps to those most\r\nin need. Let's not give any to those who don't need them.\r\n\r\nProtecting the life and property of the citizen at home is the\r\nresponsibility of all public officials, but is primarily the job of local\r\nand State law enforcement authorities.\r\n\r\nAmericans have always found the very thought of a Federal police force\r\nrepugnant, and so do I. But there are proper ways in which we can help to\r\ninsure domestic tranquility as the Constitution charges us.\r\n\r\nMy recommendations on how to control violent crime were submitted to the\r\nCongress last June with strong emphasis on protecting the innocent victims\r\nof crime. To keep a convicted criminal from committing more crimes, we must\r\nput him in prison so he cannot harm more law-abiding citizens. To be\r\neffective, this punishment must be swift and it must be certain.\r\n\r\nToo often, criminals are not sent to prison after conviction but are\r\nallowed to return to the streets. Some judges are reluctant to send\r\nconvicted criminals to prison because of inadequate facilities. To\r\nalleviate this problem at the Federal level, my new budget proposes the\r\nconstruction of four new Federal facilities.\r\n\r\nTo speed Federal justice, I propose an increase this year in the United\r\nStates attorneys prosecuting Federal crimes and the reinforcement of the\r\nnumber of United States marshals. Additional Federal judges are needed, as\r\nrecommended by me and the Judicial Conference.\r\n\r\nAnother major threat to every American's person and property is the\r\ncriminal carrying a handgun. The way to cut down on the criminal use of\r\nguns is not to take guns away from the law-abiding citizen, but to impose\r\nmandatory sentences for crimes in which a gun is used, make it harder to\r\nobtain cheap guns for criminal purposes, and concentrate gun control\r\nenforcement in highcrime areas.\r\n\r\nMy budget recommends 500 additional Federal agents in the 11 largest\r\nmetropolitan high-crime areas to help local authorities stop criminals from\r\nselling and using handguns.\r\n\r\nThe sale of hard drugs is tragically on the increase again. I have directed\r\nall agencies of the Federal Government to step up law enforcement efforts\r\nagainst those who deal in drugs. In 1975, I am glad to report, Federal\r\nagents seized substantially more heroin coming into our country than in\r\n1974.\r\n\r\nAs President, I have talked personally with the leaders of Mexico,\r\nColombia, and Turkey to urge greater efforts by their Governments to\r\ncontrol effectively the production and shipment of hard drugs.\r\n\r\nI recommended months ago that the Congress enact mandatory fixed sentences\r\nfor persons convicted of Federal crimes involving the sale of hard drugs.\r\nHard drugs, we all know, degrade the spirit as they destroy the body of\r\ntheir users.\r\n\r\nIt is unrealistic and misleading to hold out the hope that the Federal\r\nGovernment can move into every neighborhood and clean up crime. Under the\r\nConstitution, the greatest responsibility for curbing crime lies with State\r\nand local authorities. They are the frontline fighters in the war against\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nThere are definite ways in which the Federal Government can help them. I\r\nwill propose in the new budget that Congress authorize almost $7 billion\r\nover the next 5 years to assist State and local governments to protect the\r\nsafety and property of all their citizens.\r\n\r\nAs President, I pledge the strict enforcement of Federal laws and--by\r\nexample, support, and leadership--to help State and local authorities\r\nenforce their laws. Together, we must protect the victims of crime and\r\nensure domestic tranquility.\r\n\r\nLast year I strongly recommended a 5-year extension of the existing revenue\r\nsharing legislation, which thus far has provided $23 1/2 billion to help\r\nState and local units of government solve problems at home. This program\r\nhas been effective with decisionmaking transferred from the Federal\r\nGovernment to locally elected officials. Congress must act this year, or\r\nState and local units of government will have to drop programs or raise\r\nlocal taxes.\r\n\r\nIncluding my health care program reforms, I propose to consolidate some 59\r\nseparate Federal programs and provide flexible Federal dollar grants to\r\nhelp States, cities, and local agencies in such important areas as\r\neducation, child nutrition, and social services. This flexible system will\r\ndo the job better and do it closer to home.\r\n\r\nThe protection of the lives and property of Americans from foreign enemies\r\nis one of my primary responsibilities as President.\r\n\r\nIn a world of instant communications and intercontinental ballistic\r\nmissiles, in a world economy that is global and interdependent, our\r\nrelations with other nations become more, not less, important to the lives\r\nof Americans.\r\n\r\nAmerica has had a unique role in the world since the day of our\r\nindependence 200 years ago. And ever since the end of World War II, we have\r\nborne--successfully--a heavy responsibility for ensuring a stable world\r\norder and hope for human progress.\r\n\r\nToday, the state of our foreign policy is sound and strong. We are at\r\npeace, and I will do all in my power to keep it that way.\r\n\r\nOur military forces are capable and ready. Our military power is without\r\nequal, and I intend to keep it that way.\r\n\r\nOur principal alliances with the industrial democracies of the Atlantic\r\ncommunity and Japan have never been more solid.\r\n\r\nA further agreement to limit the strategic arms race may be achieved.\r\n\r\nWe have an improving relationship with China, the world's most populous\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThe key elements for peace among the nations of the Middle East now exist.\r\nOur traditional friendships in Latin America, Africa, and Asia continue.\r\n\r\nWe have taken the role of leadership in launching a serious and hopeful\r\ndialog between the industrial world and the developing world.\r\n\r\nWe have helped to achieve significant reform of the international monetary\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nWe should be proud of what America, what our country, has accomplished in\r\nthese areas, and I believe the American people are.\r\n\r\nThe American people have heard too much about how terrible our mistakes,\r\nhow evil our deeds, and how misguided our purposes. The American people\r\nknow better.\r\n\r\nThe truth is we are the world's greatest democracy. We remain the symbol of\r\nman's aspiration for liberty and well-being. We are the embodiment of hope\r\nfor progress.\r\n\r\nI say it is time we quit downgrading ourselves as a nation. Of course, it\r\nis our responsibility to learn the right lesson from past mistakes. It is\r\nour duty to see that they never happen again. But our greater duty is to\r\nlook to the future. The world's troubles will not go away.\r\n\r\nThe American people want strong and effective international and defense\r\npolicies. In our constitutional system, these policies should reflect\r\nconsultation and accommodation between the President and the Congress. But\r\nin the final analysis, as the framers of our Constitution knew from hard\r\nexperience, the foreign relations of the United States can be conducted\r\neffectively only if there is strong central direction that allows\r\nflexibility of action. That responsibility clearly rests with the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nI pledge to the American people policies which seek a secure, just, and\r\npeaceful world. I pledge to the Congress to work with you to that end.\r\n\r\nWe must not face a future in which we can no longer help our friends, such\r\nas Angola, even in limited and carefully controlled ways. We must not lose\r\nall capacity to respond short of military intervention.\r\n\r\nSome hasty actions of the Congress during the past year--most recently in\r\nrespect to Angola--were, in my view, very shortsighted. Unfortunately, they\r\nare still very much on the minds of our allies and our adversaries.\r\n\r\nA strong defense posture gives weight to our values and our views in\r\ninternational negotiations. It assures the vigor of our alliances. And it\r\nsustains our efforts to promote settlements of international conflicts.\r\nOnly from a position of strength can we negotiate a balanced agreement to\r\nlimit the growth of nuclear arms. Only a balanced agreement will serve our\r\ninterests and minimize the threat of nuclear confrontation.\r\n\r\nThe defense budget I will submit to the Congress for fiscal year 1977 will\r\nshow an essential increase over the current year. It provides for real\r\ngrowth in purchasing power over this year's defense budget, which includes\r\nthe cost of the all-volunteer force.\r\n\r\nWe are continuing to make economies to enhance the efficiency of our\r\nmilitary forces. But the budget I will submit represents the necessity of\r\nAmerican strength for the real world in which we live.\r\n\r\nAs conflict and rivalry persist in the world, our United States\r\nintelligence capabilities must be the best in the world.\r\n\r\nThe crippling of our foreign intelligence services increases the danger of\r\nAmerican involvement in direct armed conflict. Our adversaries are\r\nencouraged to attempt new adventures while our own ability to monitor\r\nevents and to influence events short of military action is undermined.\r\nWithout effective intelligence capability, the United States stands\r\nblindfolded and hobbled.\r\n\r\nIn the near future, I will take actions to reform and strengthen our\r\nintelligence community. I ask for your positive cooperation. It is time to\r\ngo beyond sensationalism and ensure an effective, responsible, and\r\nresponsive intelligence capability.\r\n\r\nTonight I have spoken about our problems at home and abroad. I have\r\nrecommended policies that will meet the challenge of our third century. I\r\nhave no doubt that our Union will endure, better, stronger, and with more\r\nindividual freedom. We can see forward only dimly--1 year, 5 years, a\r\ngeneration perhaps. Like our forefathers, we know that if we meet the\r\nchallenges of our own time with a common sense of purpose and conviction,\r\nif we remain true to our Constitution and to our ideals, then we can know\r\nthat the future will be better than the past.\r\n\r\nI see America today crossing a threshold, not just because it is our\r\nBicentennial but because we have been tested in adversity. We have taken a\r\nnew look at what we want to be and what we want our Nation to become.\r\n\r\nI see America resurgent, certain once again that life will be better for\r\nour children than it is for us, seeking strength that cannot be counted in\r\nmegatons and riches that cannot be eroded by inflation.\r\n\r\nI see these United States of America moving forward as before toward a more\r\nperfect Union where the government serves and the people rule.\r\n\r\nWe will not make this happen simply by making speeches, good or bad, yours\r\nor mine, but by hard work and hard decisions made with courage and with\r\ncommon sense.\r\n\r\nI have heard many inspiring Presidential speeches, but the words I remember\r\nbest were spoken by Dwight D. Eisenhower. \"America is not good because it\r\nis great,\" the President said. \"America is great because it is good.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Eisenhower was raised in a poor but religious home in the heart\r\nof America. His simple words echoed President Lincoln's eloquent testament\r\nthat \"right makes might.\" And Lincoln in turn evoked the silent image of\r\nGeorge Washington kneeling in prayer at Valley Forge.\r\n\r\nSo, all these magic memories which link eight generations of Americans are\r\nsummed up in the inscription just above me. How many times have we seen it?\r\n\"In God We Trust.\"\r\n\r\nLet us engrave it now in each of our hearts as we begin our Bicentennial.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nGerald R. Ford\r\nJanuary 12, 1977\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of the 95th Congress, and\r\ndistinguished guests:\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the Constitution, I come before you once again to report\r\non the state of the Union.\r\n\r\nThis report will be my last--maybe--[laughter]--but for the Union it is\r\nonly the first of such reports in our third century of independence, the\r\nclose of which none of us will ever see. We can be confident, however, that\r\n100 years from now a freely elected President will come before a freely\r\nelected Congress chosen to renew our great Republic's pledge to the\r\nGovernment of the people, by the people, and for the people.\r\n\r\nFor my part I pray the third century we are beginning will bring to all\r\nAmericans, our children and their children's children, a greater measure of\r\nindividual equality, opportunity, and justice, a greater abundance of\r\nspiritual and material blessings, and a higher quality of life, liberty,\r\nand the pursuit of happiness.\r\n\r\nThe state of the Union is a measurement of the many elements of which it is\r\ncomposed--a political union of diverse States, an economic union of varying\r\ninterests, an intellectual union of common convictions, and a moral union\r\nof immutable ideals.\r\n\r\nTaken in sum, I can report that the state of the Union is good. There is\r\nroom for improvement, as always, but today we have a more perfect Union\r\nthan when my stewardship began.\r\n\r\nAs a people we discovered that our Bicentennial was much more than a\r\ncelebration of the past; it became a joyous reaffirmation of all that it\r\nmeans to be Americans, a confirmation before all the world of the vitality\r\nand durability of our free institutions. I am proud to have been privileged\r\nto preside over the affairs of our Federal Government during these eventful\r\nyears when we proved, as I said in my first words upon assuming office,\r\nthat \"our Constitution works; our great Republic is a Government of laws\r\nand not of men. Here the people rule.\"\r\n\r\nThe people have spoken; they have chosen a new President and a new Congress\r\nto work their will. I congratulate you--particularly the new Members--as\r\nsincerely as I did President-elect Carter. In a few days it will be his\r\nduty to outline for you his priorities and legislative recommendations.\r\nTonight I will not infringe on that responsibility, but rather wish him the\r\nvery best in all that is good for our country.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of my own service in this Capitol and in the White House,\r\nI can recall many orderly transitions of governmental responsibility--of\r\nproblems as well as of position, of burdens as well as of power. The genius\r\nof the American system is that we do this so naturally and so normally.\r\nThere are no soldiers marching in the street except in the Inaugural\r\nParade; no public demonstrations except for some of the dancers at the\r\nInaugural Ball; the opposition party doesn't go underground, but goes on\r\nfunctioning vigorously in the Congress and in the country; and our vigilant\r\npress goes right on probing and publishing our faults and our follies,\r\nconfirming the wisdom of the framers of the first amendment.\r\n\r\nBecause of the transfer of authority in our form of government affects the\r\nstate of the Union and of the world, I am happy to report to you that the\r\ncurrent transition is proceeding very well. I was determined that it\r\nshould; I wanted the new President to get off on an easier start than I\r\nhad.\r\n\r\nWhen I became President on August 9, 1974, our Nation was deeply divided\r\nand tormented. In rapid succession the Vice President and the President had\r\nresigned in disgrace. We were still struggling with the after-effects of a\r\nlong, unpopular, and bloody war in Southeast Asia. The economy was unstable\r\nand racing toward the worst recession in 40 years. People were losing jobs.\r\nThe cost of living was soaring. The Congress and the Chief Executive were\r\nat loggerheads. The integrity of our constitutional process and other\r\ninstitutions was being questioned. For more than 15 years domestic spending\r\nhad soared as Federal programs multiplied, and the expense escalated\r\nannually. During the same period our national security needs were steadily\r\nshortchanged. In the grave situation which prevailed in August 1974, our\r\nwill to maintain our international leadership was in doubt.\r\n\r\nI asked for your prayers and went to work.\r\n\r\nIn January 1975 I reported to the Congress that the state of the Union was\r\nnot good. I proposed urgent action to improve the economy and to achieve\r\nenergy independence in 10 years. I reassured America's allies and sought to\r\nreduce the danger of confrontation with potential adversaries. I pledged a\r\nnew direction for America. 1975 was a year of difficult decisions, but\r\nAmericans responded with realism, common sense, and self-discipline.\r\n\r\nBy January 1976 we were headed in a new direction, which I hold to be the\r\nright direction for a free society. It was guided by the belief that\r\nsuccessful problem-solving requires more than Federal action alone, that it\r\ninvolves a full partnership among all branches and all levels of government\r\nand public policies which nurture and promote the creative energies of\r\nprivate enterprises, institutions, and individual citizens.\r\n\r\nA year ago I reported that the state of the Union was better--in many ways\r\na lot better--but still not good enough. Common sense told me to stick to\r\nthe steady course we were on, to continue to restrain the inflationary\r\ngrowth of government, to reduce taxes as well as spending, to return local\r\ndecisions to local officials, to provide for long-range sufficiency in\r\nenergy and national security needs. I resisted the immense pressures of an\r\nelection year to open the floodgates of Federal money and the temptation to\r\npromise more than I could deliver. I told it as it was to the American\r\npeople and demonstrated to the world that in our spirited political\r\ncompetition, as in this chamber, Americans can disagree without being\r\ndisagreeable.\r\n\r\nNow, after 30 months as your President, I can say that while we still have\r\na way to go, I am proud of the long way we have come together.\r\n\r\nI am proud of the part I have had in rebuilding confidence in the\r\nPresidency, confidence in our free system, and confidence in our future.\r\nOnce again, Americans believe in themselves, in their leaders, and in the\r\npromise that tomorrow holds for their children.\r\n\r\nI am proud that today America is at peace. None of our sons are fighting\r\nand dying in battle anywhere in the world. And the chance for peace among\r\nall nations is improved by our determination to honor our vital commitments\r\nin defense of peace and freedom.\r\n\r\nI am proud that the United States has strong defenses, strong alliances,\r\nand a sound and courageous foreign policy.\r\n\r\nOur alliances with major partners, the great industrial democracies of\r\nWestern Europe, Japan, and Canada, have never been more solid.\r\nConsultations on mutual security, defense, and East-West relations have\r\ngrown closer. Collaboration has branched out into new fields such as\r\nenergy, economic policy, and relations with the Third World. We have used\r\nmany avenues for cooperation, including summit meetings held among major\r\nallied countries. The friendship of the democracies is deeper, warmer, and\r\nmore effective than at any time in 30 years.\r\n\r\nWe are maintaining stability in the strategic nuclear balance and pushing\r\nback the specter of nuclear war. A decisive step forward was taken\r\nin the Vladivostok Accord which I negotiated with General Secretary\r\nBrezhnev--joint recognition that an equal ceiling should be placed\r\non the number of strategic weapons on each side. With resolve and wisdom\r\non the part of both nations, a good agreement is well within reach\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\nThe framework for peace in the Middle East has been built. Hopes for future\r\nprogress in the Middle East were stirred by the historic agreements we\r\nreached and the trust and confidence that we formed. Thanks to American\r\nleadership, the prospects for peace in the Middle East are brighter than\r\nthey have been in three decades. The Arab states and Israel continue to\r\nlook to us to lead them from confrontation and war to a new era of\r\naccommodation and peace. We have no alternative but to persevere, and I am\r\nsure we will. The opportunities for a final settlement are great, and the\r\nprice of failure is a return to the bloodshed and hatred that for too long\r\nhave brought tragedy to all of the peoples of this area and repeatedly\r\nedged the world to the brink of war.\r\n\r\nOur relationship with the People's Republic of China is proving its\r\nimportance and its durability. We are finding more and more common ground\r\nbetween our two countries on basic questions of international affairs.\r\n\r\nIn my two trips to Asia as President, we have reaffirmed America's\r\ncontinuing vital interest in the peace and security of Asia and the Pacific\r\nBasin, established a new partnership with Japan, confirmed our dedication\r\nto the security of Korea, and reinforced our ties with the free nations of\r\nSoutheast Asia.\r\n\r\nAn historic dialog has begun between industrial nations and developing\r\nnations. Most proposals on the table are the initiatives of the United\r\nStates, including those on food, energy, technology, trade, investment, and\r\ncommodities. We are well launched on this process of shaping positive and\r\nreliable economic relations between rich nations and poor nations over the\r\nlong term.\r\n\r\nWe have made progress in trade negotiations and avoided protectionism\r\nduring recession. We strengthened the international monetary system. During\r\nthe past 2 years the free world's most important economic powers have\r\nalready brought about important changes that serve both developed and\r\ndeveloping economies. The momentum already achieved must be nurtured and\r\nstrengthened, for the prosperity of the rich and poor depends upon it.\r\n\r\nIn Latin America, our relations have taken on a new maturity and a sense of\r\ncommon enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn Africa the quest for peace, racial justice, and economic progress is at\r\na crucial point. The United States, in close cooperation with the United\r\nKingdom, is actively engaged in this historic process. Will change come\r\nabout by warfare and chaos and foreign intervention? Or will it come about\r\nby negotiated and fair solutions, ensuring majority rule, minority rights,\r\nand economic advance? America is committed to the side of peace and justice\r\nand to the principle that Africa should shape its own future, free of\r\noutside intervention.\r\n\r\nAmerican leadership has helped to stimulate new international efforts to\r\nstem the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to shape a comprehensive\r\ntreaty governing the use of oceans.\r\n\r\nI am gratified by these accomplishments. They constitute a record of broad\r\nsuccess for America and for the peace and prosperity of all mankind. This\r\nadministration leaves to its successor a world in better condition than we\r\nfound. We leave, as well, a solid foundation for progress on a range of\r\nissues that are vital to the well-being of America.\r\n\r\nWhat has been achieved in the field of foreign affairs and what can be\r\naccomplished by the new administration demonstrate the genius of Americans\r\nworking together for the common good. It is this, our remarkable ability to\r\nwork together, that has made us a unique nation. It is Congress, the\r\nPresident, and the people striving for a better world.\r\n\r\nI know all patriotic Americans want this Nation's foreign policy to\r\nsucceed. I urge members of my party in this Congress to give the new\r\nPresident loyal support in this area. I express the hope that this new\r\nCongress will reexamine its constitutional role in international affairs.\r\n\r\nThe exclusive right to declare war, the duty to advise and consent on the\r\npart of the Senate, the power of the purse on the part of the House are\r\nample authority for the legislative branch and should be jealously guarded.\r\nBut because we may have been too careless of these powers in the past does\r\nnot justify congressional intrusion into, or obstruction of, the proper\r\nexercise of Presidential responsibilities now or in the future. There can\r\nbe only one Commander in Chief. In these times crises cannot be managed and\r\nwars cannot be waged by committee, nor can peace be pursued solely by\r\nparliamentary debate. To the ears of the world, the President speaks for\r\nthe Nation. While he is, of course, ultimately accountable to the Congress,\r\nthe courts, and the people, he and his emissaries must not be handicapped\r\nin advance in their relations with foreign governments as has sometimes\r\nhappened in the past.\r\n\r\nAt home I am encouraged by the Nation's recovery from the recession and our\r\nsteady return to sound economic growth. It is now continuing after the\r\nrecent period of uncertainty, which is part of the price we pay for free\r\nelections.\r\n\r\nOur most pressing need today and the future is more jobs--productive,\r\npermanent jobs created by a thriving economy. We must revise our tax system\r\nboth to ease the burden of heavy taxation and to encourage the investment\r\nnecessary for the creation of productive jobs for all Americans who want to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nEarlier this month I proposed a permanent income tax reduction of $10\r\nbillion below current levels, including raising the personal exemption from\r\n$750 to $1,000. I also recommended a series of measures to stimulate\r\ninvestment, such as accelerated depreciation for new plants and equipment\r\nin areas of high unemployment, a reduction in the corporate tax rate from\r\n48 to 46 percent, and eliminating the present double taxation of dividends.\r\nI strongly urge the Congress to pass these measures to help create the\r\nproductive, permanent jobs in the private economy that are so essential for\r\nour future.\r\n\r\nAll the basic trends are good; we are not on the brink of another recession\r\nor economic disaster. If we follow prudent policies that encourage\r\nproductive investment and discourage destructive inflation, we will come\r\nout on top, and I am sure we will.\r\n\r\nWe have successfully cut inflation by more than half. When I took office,\r\nthe Consumer Price Index was rising at 12.2 percent a year. During 1976 the\r\nrate of inflation was 5 percent.\r\n\r\nWe have created more jobs--over 4 million more jobs today than in the\r\nspring of 1975. Throughout this Nation today we have over 88 million people\r\nin useful, productive jobs--more than at any other time in our Nation's\r\nhistory. But there are still too many Americans unemployed. This is the\r\ngreatest regret that I have as I leave office.\r\n\r\nWe brought about with the Congress, after much delay, the renewal of the\r\ngeneral revenue sharing. We expanded community development and Federal\r\nmanpower programs. We began a significant urban mass transit program.\r\nFederal programs today provide more funds for our States and local\r\ngovernments than ever before--$70 billion for the current fiscal year.\r\nThrough these programs and others that provide aid directly to individuals,\r\nwe have kept faith with our tradition of compassionate help for those who\r\nneed it. As we begin our third century we can be proud of the progress that\r\nwe have made in meeting human needs for all of our citizens.\r\n\r\nWe have cut the growth of crime by nearly 90 percent. Two years ago crime\r\nwas increasing at the rate of 18 percent annually. In the first three\r\nquarters of 1976, that growth rate had been cut to 2 percent. But crime,\r\nand the fear of crime, remains one of the most serious problems facing our\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nWe have had some successes, and there have been some disappointments.\r\nBluntly, I must remind you that we have not made satisfactory progress\r\ntoward achieving energy independence. Energy is absolutely vital to the\r\ndefense of our country, to the strength of our economy, and to the quality\r\nof our lives.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago I proposed to the Congress the first comprehensive national\r\nenergy program--a specific and coordinated set of measures that would end\r\nour vulnerability to embargo, blockade, or arbitrary price increases and\r\nwould mobilize U.S. technology and resources to supply a significant share\r\nof the free world's energy after 1985. Of the major energy proposals I\r\nsubmitted 2 years ago, only half, belatedly, became law. In 1973 we were\r\ndependent upon foreign oil imports for 36 percent of our needs. Today, we\r\nare 40-percent dependent, and we'll pay out $34 billion for foreign oil\r\nthis year. Such vulnerability at present or in the future is intolerable\r\nand must be ended.\r\n\r\nThe answer to where we stand on our national energy effort today reminds me\r\nof the old argument about whether the tank is half full or half empty. The\r\npessimist will say we have half failed to achieve our 10-year energy goals;\r\nthe optimist will say that we have half succeeded. I am always an optimist,\r\nbut we must make up for lost time.\r\n\r\nWe have laid a solid foundation for completing the enormous task which\r\nconfronts us. I have signed into law five major energy bills which contain\r\nsignificant measures for conservation, resource development, stockpiling,\r\nand standby authorities. We have moved forward to develop the naval\r\npetroleum reserves; to build a 500-million barrel strategic petroleum\r\nstockpile; to phase out unnecessary Government allocation and price\r\ncontrols; to develop a lasting relationship with other oil consuming\r\nnations; to improve the efficiency of energy use through conservation in\r\nautomobiles, buildings, and industry; and to expand research on new\r\ntechnology and renewable resources such as wind power, geothermal and solar\r\nenergy. All these actions, significant as they are for the long term, are\r\nonly the beginning.\r\n\r\nI recently submitted to the Congress my proposals to reorganize the Federal\r\nenergy structure and the hard choices which remain if we are serious about\r\nreducing our dependence upon foreign energy. These include programs to\r\nreverse our declining production of natural gas and increase incentives for\r\ndomestic crude oil production. I proposed to minimize environmental\r\nuncertainties affecting coal development, expand nuclear power generation,\r\nand create an energy independence authority to provide government financial\r\nassistance for vital energy programs where private capital is not\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nWe must explore every reasonable prospect for meeting our energy needs when\r\nour current domestic reserves of oil and natural gas begin to dwindle in\r\nthe next decade. I urgently ask Congress and the new administration to move\r\nquickly on these issues. This Nation has the resources and the capability\r\nto achieve our energy goals if its Government has the will to proceed, and\r\nI think we do.\r\n\r\nI have been disappointed by inability to complete many of the meaningful\r\norganizational reforms which I contemplated for the Federal Government,\r\nalthough a start has been made. For example, the Federal judicial system\r\nhas long served as a model for other courts. But today it is threatened by\r\na shortage of qualified Federal judges and an explosion of litigation\r\nclaiming Federal jurisdiction. I commend to the new administration and the\r\nCongress the recent report and recommendations of the Department of\r\nJustice, undertaken at my request, on \"the needs of the Federal Courts.\" I\r\nespecially endorse its proposals for a new commission on the judicial\r\nappointment process.\r\n\r\nWhile the judicial branch of our Government may require reinforcement, the\r\nbudgets and payrolls of the other branches remain staggering. I cannot help\r\nbut observe that while the White House staff and the Executive Office of\r\nthe President have been reduced and the total number of civilians in the\r\nexecutive branch contained during the 1970's, the legislative branch has\r\nincreased substantially although the membership of the Congress remains at\r\n535. Congress now costs the taxpayers more than a million dollars per\r\nMember; the whole legislative budget has passed the billion dollar mark.\r\n\r\nWe have made some progress in cutting back the expansion of government and\r\nits intrusion into individual lives, but believe me, there is much more to\r\nbe done--and you and I know it. It can only be done by tough and\r\ntemporarily painful surgery by a Congress as prepared as the President to\r\nface up to this very real political problem. Again, I wish my successor,\r\nworking with a substantial majority of his own party, the best of success\r\nin reforming the costly and cumbersome machinery of the Federal\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe task of self-government is never finished. The problems are great; the\r\nopportunities are greater.\r\n\r\nAmerica's first goal is and always will be peace with honor. America must\r\nremain first in keeping peace in the world. We can remain first in peace\r\nonly if we are never second in defense.\r\n\r\nIn presenting the state of the Union to the Congress and to the American\r\npeople, I have a special obligation as Commander in Chief to report on our\r\nnational defense. Our survival as a free and independent people requires,\r\nabove all, strong military forces that are well equipped and highly trained\r\nto perform their assigned mission.\r\n\r\nI am particularly gratified to report that over the past 2 1/2 years, we\r\nhave been able to reverse the dangerous decline of the previous decade in\r\nreal resources this country was devoting to national defense. This was an\r\nimmediate problem I faced in 1974. The evidence was unmistakable that the\r\nSoviet Union had been steadily increasing the resources it applied to\r\nbuilding its military strength. During this same period the United States\r\nreal defense spending declined. In my three budgets we not only arrested\r\nthat dangerous decline, but we have established the positive trend which is\r\nessential to our ability to contribute to peace and stability in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe Vietnam war, both materially and psychologically, affected our overall\r\ndefense posture. The dangerous anti-military sentiment discouraged defense\r\nspending and unfairly disparaged the men and women who serve in our Armed\r\nForces.\r\n\r\nThe challenge that now confronts this country is whether we have the\r\nnational will and determination to continue this essential defense effort\r\nover the long term, as it must be continued. We can no longer afford to\r\noscillate from year to year in so vital a matter; indeed, we have a duty to\r\nlook beyond the immediate question of budgets and to examine the nature of\r\nthe problem we will face over the next generation.\r\n\r\nI am the first recent President able to address long-term, basic issues\r\nwithout the burden of Vietnam. The war in Indochina consumed enormous\r\nresources at the very time that the overwhelming strategic superiority we\r\nonce enjoyed was disappearing. In past years, as a result of decisions by\r\nthe United States, our strategic forces leveled off, yet the Soviet Union\r\ncontinued a steady, constant buildup of its own forces, committing a high\r\npercentage of its national economic effort to defense.\r\n\r\nThe United States can never tolerate a shift in strategic balance against\r\nus or even a situation where the American people or our allies believe the\r\nbalance is shifting against us. The United States would risk the most\r\nserious political consequences if the world came to believe that our\r\nadversaries have a decisive margin of superiority.\r\n\r\nTo maintain a strategic balance we must look ahead to the 1980's and\r\nbeyond. The sophistication of modern weapons requires that we make\r\ndecisions now if we are to ensure our security 10 years from now.\r\nTherefore, I have consistently advocated and strongly urged that we pursue\r\nthree critical strategic programs: the Trident missile launching submarine;\r\nthe B-1 bomber, with its superior capability to penetrate modern air\r\ndefenses; and a more advanced intercontinental ballistic missile that will\r\nbe better able to survive nuclear attack and deliver a devastating\r\nretaliatory strike.\r\n\r\nIn an era where the strategic nuclear forces are in rough equilibrium, the\r\nrisks of conflict below the nuclear threshold may grow more perilous. A\r\nmajor, long-term objective, therefore, is to maintain capabilities to deal\r\nwith, and thereby deter, conventional challenges and crises, particularly\r\nin Europe.\r\n\r\nWe cannot rely solely on strategic forces to guarantee our security or to\r\ndeter all types of aggression. We must have superior naval and marine\r\nforces to maintain freedom of the seas, strong multipurpose tactical air\r\nforces, and mobile, modern ground forces. Accordingly, I have directed a\r\nlong-term effort to improve our worldwide capabilities to deal with\r\nregional crises.\r\n\r\nI have submitted a 5-year naval building program indispensable to the\r\nNation's maritime strategy. Because the security of Europe and the\r\nintegrity of NATO remain the cornerstone of American defense policy, I have\r\ninitiated a special, long-term program to ensure the capacity of the\r\nAlliance to deter or defeat aggression in Europe.\r\n\r\nAs I leave office I can report that our national defense is effectively\r\ndeterring conflict today. Our Armed Forces are capable of carrying out the\r\nvariety of missions assigned to them. Programs are underway which will\r\nassure we can deter war in the years ahead. But I also must warn that it\r\nwill require a sustained effort over a period of years to maintain these\r\ncapabilities. We must have the wisdom, the stamina, and the courage to\r\nprepare today for the perils of tomorrow, and I believe we will.\r\n\r\nAs I look to the future--and I assure you I intend to go on doing that for\r\na good many years--I can say with confidence that the state of the Union is\r\ngood, but we must go on making it better and better.\r\n\r\nThis gathering symbolizes the constitutional foundation which makes\r\ncontinued progress possible, synchronizing the skills of three independent\r\nbranches of Government, reserving fundamental sovereignty to the people of\r\nthis great land. It is only as the temporary representatives and servants\r\nof the people that we meet here, we bring no hereditary status or gift of\r\ninfallibility, and none follows us from this place.\r\n\r\nLike President Washington, like the more fortunate of his successors, I\r\nlook forward to the status of private citizen with gladness and gratitude.\r\nTo me, being a citizen of the United States of America is the greatest\r\nhonor and privilege in this world.\r\n\r\nFrom the opportunities which fate and my fellow citizens have given me, as\r\na Member of the House, as Vice President and President of the Senate, and\r\nas President of all the people, I have come to understand and place the\r\nhighest value on the checks and balances which our founders imposed on\r\ngovernment through the separation of powers among co-equal legislative,\r\nexecutive, and judicial branches. This often results in difficulty and\r\ndelay, as I well know, but it also places supreme authority under God,\r\nbeyond any one person, any one branch, any majority great or small, or any\r\none party. The Constitution is the bedrock of all our freedoms. Guard and\r\ncherish it, keep honor and order in your own house, and the Republic will\r\nendure.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to end these remarks. In this Chamber, along with some of\r\nyou, I have experienced many, many of the highlights of my life. It was\r\nhere that I stood 28 years ago with my freshman colleagues, as Speaker Sam\r\nRayburn administered the oath. I see some of you now--Charlie Bennett, Dick\r\nBolling, Carl Perkins, Pete Rodino, Harley Staggers, Tom Steed, Sid Yates,\r\nClem Zablocki-and I remember those who have gone to their rest. It was here\r\nwe waged many, many a lively battle--won some, lost some, but always\r\nremaining friends. It was here, surrounded by such friends, that the\r\ndistinguished Chief Justice swore me in as Vice President on December 6,\r\n1973. It was here I returned 8 months later as your President to ask not\r\nfor a honeymoon, but for a good marriage.\r\n\r\nI will always treasure those memories and your many, many kindnesses. I\r\nthank you for them all.\r\n\r\nMy fellow Americans, I once asked you for your prayers, and now I give you\r\nmine: May God guide this wonderful country, its people, and those they have\r\nchosen to lead them. May our third century be illuminated by liberty and\r\nblessed with brotherhood, so that we and all who come after us may be the\r\nhumble servants of thy peace. Amen.\r\n\r\nGood night. God bless you.",
